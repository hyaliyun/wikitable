The column and statue commemorate King Sigismund III Vasa, who in 1596 had moved Poland's capital from Krak√≥w to Warsaw. On the Corinthian column (which used to be of red marble), 8.5 m high, a sculpture of the King, 2.75-metres high, in archaistic armour is placed. Sigismund's Column now stands at 22 metres and is adorned by four eagles. The king is dressed in armor and carries a cross in one hand and wields a sword in the other. Origins and design ;17th century Construction of the Sigismund's Column, detail of the 1646 engraving by Willem Hondius. Erected between 1643 and 1644, the column was constructed on the orders of Sigismund's son and successor, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. It was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. The Zygmunt's Column was modelled on the Italian columns in front of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore (erected in 1614 to designs of Carlo Maderno), and the Column of Phocas in Rome (W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa had seen both of them during his visit to Rome in 1625). In 1681 the monument was surrounded with a wooden fence, which was later replaced with a permanent iron fence. ;18th and 19th centuries The marble column itself was renovated several times in the next few centuries, most notably in 1743, 1810, 1821 and 1828. In 1854 the monument was surrounded with a fountain featuring marble tritons sculpted by the German, August Kiss. In 1863 the column was renovated somewhat again, but still needed work, and between 1885 and 1887 it was replaced with a new column of granite. Between 1927 and 1930, the monument was again renovated, and was restored to its original appearance when the fountain and the fence around it were removed. Toppled statue, 1945 ;20th century On 1 September 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the monument's column was demolished by the Germans, and its bronze statue was badly damaged. After the war the statue was repaired, and in 1949 it was set up on a new column, made of granite from the Strzegom mine, a couple of metres from the original site. The original broken pieces of the column can still be seen lying next to the Royal Castle.

The pilgrim's travels take him through southern and central Ukraine, Russia, and Siberia. It is unknown if the book is literally an account of a single pilgrim, or if it uses a fictional pilgrim's journey as a vehicle to teach the practice of ceaseless inner prayer and communion with God. The Russian original, or a copy of it, was present at a Mount Athos monastery in Greece in the 19th century, and was first published in Kazan in 1884, under the Russian title that translates as \\"Candid Narratives of a Pilgrim to His Spiritual Father.\\" ()The Russian title of the book is \\"–û—Ç–∫—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –¥—É—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º—É —Å–≤–æ–µ–º—É –æ—Ç—Ü—É\\" ‚Äì literally, \\"Candid narratives of a pilgrim to his spiritual father.\\" Authorship Critical scholarship has investigated the authorship of the four original and three supplementary tales. Aleksei Pentkovsky has argued that the first four tales survive in the form of a later redaction of an original work by Archimandrite Mikhail Kozlov (1826‚Äì1884), The Seeker of Unceasing Prayer, and that the supplementary tales are the work of Arsenii Troepolskii (1804‚Äì1870). Both of these men spent time as wanderers.Aleksei Pentkovsky (ed.), The Pilgrim's Tale, Paulist Press, 1999, introduction. Cf. Suzette Phillips in Holder 2009, pp. 294f. Plot The pilgrim's inner journey begins when he is struck upon hearing the words of Paul (in I Thessalonians 5:17) to \\"pray without ceasing.\\" He visits churches and monasteries to try and understand how to pray without ceasing. His travels lead him to a starets (a spiritual father) who teaches him the Jesus Prayer‚Äî\\"Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me\\"‚Äîand gives him practical advice on how to recite the prayer uninterruptedly, as a type of mantra.Smith, Huston, in the foreword of: The book details the gradual spiritual development and struggles of the narrator, and the effect the narrator's spirituality has on those around him. The sequel is entitled The Pilgrim Continues his Way. Translations of both documents were published together in some English editions. Background The most widely used English edition was translated by an Anglican clergyman who had served in Arkhangelsk, Reginald Michael (R. M.) French (1884-1969), and first published in 1931. In his Translator's Note, French wrote of the pilgrim that \\"everyone will appreciate the sincerity of his conviction and few probably will doubt the reality of his experience.\\" French wrote that the events described in the book \\"appear to belong to a Russia prior to the liberation of the serfs [in] 1861.\\" French also observed that the Pilgrim's narrative mentions the Crimean War, which began in 1853. Therefore, it was \\"between those two dates,\\" 1853 and 1861, that the Pilgrim arrived at Irkutsk and found a spiritual father, two of the major events in the Pilgrim's narrative. Franny and Zooey The Way of a Pilgrim is central to the plot of both stories in Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger. Franny Glass, a young college student, is fascinated with The Way of a Pilgrim, describing it as a way \\"to see God,\\" and saying that the Jesus Prayer is similar to techniques in Hinduism and Buddhism. Her brother Zooey knows that Franny's copy of the book actually belonged to their late brother, Seymour. Zooey questions her seeming obsession with the prayer. Franny and Zooey became an international best-seller, and was influential in spreading the popularity of The Way of a Pilgrim outside of monastic traditions and to people of different religious backgrounds. Reception to the way of prayer described in the book The Way of a Pilgrim is one of the most widely circulated prayer manuals in the Western world, with the Jesus Prayer possibly the most widely practiced Christian prayer after the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary. The popularity of the book was influential in the modern rediscovery of hesychasm as a living practice. The pilgrim's method of prayer that is described in the book has received a mixed reception over the years from academics and clergy. Saint Ignatius Bryanchaninov wrote that the book might give a student the impression that \\"unceasing prayer of the heart,\\" one goal of the practice, can be achieved after only a few weeks of practice, but that the pilgrim's experience and preparation were remarkable. His life leading up to the practice, and his study under a starets (his spiritual father), prepared him for the beneficial results he received. In an introduction to the translation by Olga Savin, Thomas Hopko describes the book as a \\"spiritual classic\\" which teaches that ceaseless prayer is not only the goal, and the one thing worth living for, but is \\"life itself.\\" Like other clergy, he points out that the pilgrim teaches the practice of ceaseless prayer should be done with the guidance of a spiritual father, and with active participation in the Church and liturgy. He wrote that the book is for all who are pilgrims, and that it \\"provides protection and nourishment for the trip, pointing to its perils and demonstrating its rewards.\\" Professor of the Moscow Theological Academy Alexei Osipov speaks in an interviewInterview with Prof. A.I.

In his opinion, the aim of the prayer, its steps, connection of the nous and the heart, the actions of grace in the book ‚Äî all contradict the teaching of the Holy Fathers and can lead to delusion (prelest). Besides many Holy Fathers, Professor Osipov cites the letters of St. Theophan the Recluse, who initially corrected one of the editions of the book. In the end of his life, St. Theophan wrote to one person not to read the book because some of its advice was not suitable for that person, as it could lead him to prelest. St. Theophan the Recluse. Letters. Vol. 5. Letter 825. Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev) also cautions about the limitations of the pilgrim's method of the prayer in his book on imiaslavie and Jesus prayer. Hier. Hilarion (Alfeyev). Holy Secret of the Church. 2002. Metropolitan Hilarion writes that the pilgrim's rate of the prayer is significantly faster than in the teaching of St. Ignatius Brianchaninov and St. Theophan the Recluse, who also did not recommend to use psychosomatic method of the prayer. Metropolitan Hilarion writes that St. Theophan removed the writings of the Holy Fathers on psychosomatic method from his edition of the book and edited some parts that could cause prelest. On the other hand, Metropolitan Hilarion notes the success of the book and its role in the acquaintance of the West with the Eastern Christian practices of the Jesus prayer.

He is remembered for the Italianization of the House of Savoy, as he recovered the savoyard state (invaded and occupied by France when he was a child) following the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) and subsequently moved the capital to Turin and made Italian the official language in Piedmont. Born in Chamb√©ry, Emmanuel Philibert was the only child of Charles III, Duke of Savoy, and Beatrice of Portugal to reach adulthood. His mother was sister-in-law to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the future duke served in Charles's army during the war against Francis I of France, distinguishing himself by capturing Hesdin in July 1553. A month later, he became Duke of Savoy on the death of his father, but this was a nearly empty honour, as the vast majority of his hereditary lands had been occupied and administered by the French since 1536. Instead, he continued to serve the Habsburgs in hopes of recovering his lands, and served his cousin Philip II of Spain as Governor of the Netherlands from 1555 to 1559. In this capacity, he personally led the Spanish invasion of northern France and won a brilliant victory at Saint-Quentin on 10 August 1557. He was also a suitor to Lady Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of Henry VIII of England. With the Peace of Cateau Cambr√©sis between France and Spain signed in 1559, the duchy was restored to Emmanuel Philibert and he married his first cousin once removed, Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry, the sister of King Henry II of France. Their only child was Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy. Following the death of his uncle, Henry I of Portugal, on 31 January 1580, Emmanuel Philibert fought to impose his rights as a claimant to the Portuguese throne. However, he soon realised that he had quite a fragile position due to the claims of Philip II, who gained control of the country, thus uniting Spain and Portugal. Emmanuel Philibert spent his rule regaining what had been lost in the costly wars with France. A skilled political strategist, he took advantage of various squabbles in Europe to slowly regain territory from both the French and the Spanish, including the city of Turin. He also purchased two territories. Internally, he moved the capital of the duchy from Chamb√©ry to Turin and replaced Latin as the duchy's official language with Italian. He was attempting to acquire the marquisate of Saluzzo when he died in Turin. Later, he was buried in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud of the Turin Cathedral, to which he had moved the Sindone in 1578.

SSDP is focused on reforming drug policy in the United States and internationally. SSDP neither condones nor condemns drug use. History In the fall of 1996, members of the Student Drug Reform Movement (SDRM) begin to chat over the internet using a Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet) discussion page. In 1997, the Rochester Cannabis Coalition (RCC) at the Rochester Institute of Technology applied to become an official student organization dedicated to fighting the War on Drugs; RIT denied RCC's application and ultimately expelled the lead organizer, Shea Gunther, who would go on to become an SSDP founder. In winter 1998, SDRM members at University of Massachusetts Amherst hosted a conference for about 50 students, many of whom would go on to join the inaugural founding membership class of SSDP. That conference led to the First National Gathering in Washington, DC the following year, where attendees decided to collectively to form SSDP into a national organization and elect a board of directors composed of one representative from each of the five schools that had chapters operating under the SSDP name (Hampshire College, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, George Washington University, American University, and Rochester Institute of Technology). SSDP undertook a series of actions and events which contributed to partial repeal of the Higher Education Act Aid Elimination Penalty (HEAAEP). =Chronology= January 2000 ‚Äì First National Action. At and around the College Convention 2000 in New Hampshire, SSDP students protested the HEAAEP. Spring 2000 ‚ÄìFirst Loan Replacement Program. Hampshire College instituted the first HEAAEP loan replacement program and its president was the first to come out against the HEAAEP. March 3, 2001 ‚Äì Legislation to Repeal. A coalition of U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would repeal a moratorium on federal financial aid to college students with drug convictions, citing denial of aid for 8,162 students that school year. March 15, 2001 ‚Äì \\"Students VS. the Drug War.\\" An article featuring SSDP appeared in Rolling Stone. HEAAEP victim Marisa Garcia '00 was profiled and the article marked SSDP's big break into public awareness. Spring 2001 ‚Äì Colleges Urge Change. Five Oregon colleges passed resolutions urging changes to the HEAAEP. Thirteen leading education associations representing admissions officers, community and state colleges, financial aid administrators and student groups sent a strongly worded letter outlining flaws in the HEAAEP to the head of the DEA. February 2002 ‚Äì Souder Confronted About HEAAEP. Members of SSDP attended an event to get long-awaited answers from Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN) about the HEAAEP legislation he authored. 2006 ‚Äì Partial Repeal of the HEA. Congress, responding to pressure from SSDP and other advocates, scaled back the HEA Aid Elimination Penalty, taking away its \\"reachback effect\\" so that it would only affect students convicted for offenses that occur while they are enrolled in college and receiving aid. SSDP has expanded from a single chapter in upstate New York created by a handful of students to a network of over 300 chapters worldwide. Board Students for Sensible Drug Policy is governed by a Board of Directors . The board of directors represents SSDP's chapters at the national level. At least two- thirds of the members of SSDP's Board of Directors are students or young people elected by SSDP's chapters each year during the organization's national Congress. Amy Hildebrand, DePaul University, is the current Chair. Main issues = Global Drug Policy = SSDP is a member of the Economic and Social Council and thus a consultant to its functional commissions. As such, SSDP has been advocating for policy reform and youth inclusion at the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, including the 2016 Special Session of the UN General Assembly on the World Drug Problem and the High Level Ministerial Segment in 2019. SSDP Global Fellow, Orsi Feh√©r, has held the office of Treasurer on the board of the Vienna NGO Committee on Drugs between 2018‚Äì2020. SSDP's former International Program Coordinator, Jake Agliata, is a co-founder of the Paradigma Youth Coalition. The organization also coordinates youth participation in global campaigns such as Support. Don't Punish and International Overdose Awareness Day. = 911 Good Samaritan policies = A campus Good Samaritan policy or medical amnesty policy is a policy designed to prevent students from hesitating to call for medical assistance in the event of a medical emergency related to alcohol or other drugs. =Just Say Know= Just Say Know, is a peer-to-peer drug education program, provides evidence- based drug information on campus, teaches students to recognize and address dangerous behaviors and attitudes, empowers them to reduce drug-related harm within their communities, and fosters analysis of the relationship between drug policy and drug use. Just Say Know provides a platform from which we create the values future generations will hold about drug policy and drug use culture as we move forward, valuing education over incarceration. =Marijuana policy reform= SSDP chapters provide the ground forces and the teams of volunteers for many large state and federal campaigns. Students and chapters work on state and local marijuana policy reform by supporting legislation and ballot initiatives for decriminalization, medical marijuana, taxation and regulation, and lowest priority policies. =Pell Grants for incarcerated students= Students for Sensible Drug Policy partners with the College and Community Fellowship and The Fortune Society as part of the Education from the Inside Out Coalition to help remove barriers to higher education funding facing students in prison. =Harm reduction advocacy= Harm reduction is the act of mitigating the negative consequences associated with drug use. SSDP provides tools for its members to advocate for the implementation of harm reduction measures, as well as to engage in direct service work. =Psychedelic legalization= SSDP provides resources for its members to advocate for legalization of psychedelics. =Student drug testing= According to its official website, SSDP opposes student drug testing. Campus chapters SSDP is made up of students and community members organized on college and high school campuses across the world. In 2015‚Äì2016, SSDP chapters were on 320 campuses, included 4,312 student activists and engaged in 135 drug policy initiatives. Across the United States, there are eight regional divisions: Heartland, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Mountain, Northeast, Pacific, Southeast, and Southwest. =International= Several international chapters in 28 different countries across 5 continents engage in reform at community, national, and regional levels; represent the voices of youth from their countries at the United Nations; and share their experiences fighting the drug war with their fellow SSDPers all over the world. The SSDP international network has doubled in size through 2018 and expanded its structure to include regional fellowships to represent the specific needs of the Latin American, West African and European chapters. Alumni Association The SSDP Alumni Association is composed of individuals who determine their own activities and levels of involvement. Individuals are organized geographically into regional SSDP Alumni Associations based on where they currently reside. However, individuals may of course participate in other regional networks by joining additional regional SSDP Facebook groups (ex: if the region you attended school is different from where you currently live). The Deputy Director is responsible for managing the mentoring program by matching mentors and mentees, as well as training mentors on appropriate and effective mentorship. DARE Committee The Diversity, Awareness, Reflection, and Education committee (DARE) publishes a Monthly Mosaic to highlight the intersection between drug war, communities, and a broad range of issues. Since its founding in March 2011, DARE has taken on the challenges of strengthening diversity in all its forms within SSDP. The committee endeavors to ensure that the range of perspectives & personal experiences of all communities and individuals negatively impacted in the War on Drugs are represented & integrated into SSDP & the drug policy reform movement at large. DARE does this by creating a welcoming, open, & safe space for all stakeholders.

The city of Saluzzo is built on a hill overlooking a vast, well-cultivated plain. Iron, lead, silver, marble, slate etc. are found in the surrounding mountains. On January 1, 2017 it had a population of 16,968. Saluzzo was the birthplace of the writer Silvio Pellico and of typographer Giambattista Bodoni. History Saluzzo (Salusse in Piemontese, Saluces in French) was a civitas (tribal city state) of the Vagienni, or mountain Ligures, and later of the Salluvii. This district was brought under Roman control by the Consul Marcus Fulvius circa 125BC. In the Carolingian age it became the residence of a count; later, having passed to the Marquesses of Susa, Manfred I, son of Marquess Bonifacio del Vasto, on the division of that principality became Marquess of Saluzzo; this family held the marquisate of Saluzzo from 1142 to 1548. The marquisate embraced the territory lying between the Alps, the Po and the Stura, and was extended on several occasions. In the Middle Ages it had a chequered existence, often being in conflict with powerful neighbours, chiefly the Counts (later Dukes) of Savoy. After Manfred II's death, his widow had to accept a series of tributes, which were to be later the base of the House of Savoy's claims over the increasingly feebler marquises' territories. Thomas III, a vassal of France, wrote the romance Le chevalier errant ('the knight-errant'). Ludovico I (1416‚Äì75) started the Golden Age of the city and imposed himself as a mediator between the neighbouring powers. Ludovico II constructed a tunnel, no longer in use, through the Monviso, a remarkable work for the time. With the help of the French he resisted a vigorous siege by the Duke of Savoy in 1486, but in 1487 yielded and retired to France where he wrote L'art de la chevalerie sous Veg√®ce (\\"The art of chivalry under Vegetius\\", 1488), a treatise on good government, and other works on military affairs. He was a patron of clerics and authors. In 1490 Ludovico regained power, but after his death, his sons struggled longly for the rule and impoverished the state. After long struggles for independence, the marquisate was occupied (1548) by the French, as a fief of the Crown of France ‚Äì with the name of Saluces ‚Äì and remained part of that kingdom until it was ceded to Savoy in 1601. In 1588 Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy took possession of the city. Thenceforward Saluzzo shared the destinies of Piedmont, with which it formed \\"one of the keys of the house\\" of Italy. The Marquisate of Saluzzo is the setting of Boccaccio's tale of Griselda, the final story in the Decameron, as well as Chaucer's Clerk's Tale in The Canterbury Tales.http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/gchaucer/bl- gchau-can-clerk.htm The municipality of Saluzzo absorbed at the beginning of 2019 the neighbouring commune of Castellar, thus enforcing the results of a referendum held in the summer of 2018.Referendum sulla fusione Saluzzo- Castellar: vince il s√¨; article on La Stampa of July 16, 2018, see www.lastampa.it  Geography  The municipality of Saluces occupies a vast area of in the Po Valley, about east of Mount Viso.  Duomo  The , also known as the Cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary of the Assumption, stands out for its late-Gothic forms; built outside the walls just beyond Porta Santa Maria between 1491 and 1501, it was a bishop's seat starting from 1511. The fa√ßade is in exposed brick, adorned by three portals surmounted by terracotta gables that house statues of the apostles (central portal), while above the side there are the patron San Chiaffredo and San Costanzo. The interior has a covering made up of cross vaults, while the Baroque high altar with its large impact is of great impact eleven wooden statues by Carlo Giuseppe Plura and collaborators. In the central nave, you can admire a precious fourteenth- century wooden crucifix. To the left of the main altar is the Chapel of the SS. Sacramento, with a polyptych by the Flemish artist of French origin Hans Clemer, better known as Maestro d'Elva.  Toponymy  The Marquisate of Saluzzo was the seat of a Piedmontese principality whose history is closely linked to that of its powerful neighbor, the House of Savoy, until its definitive incorporation obtained in 1601 by Duke Charles Emmanuel. The French name of Saluces was given to the city during the period of French domination. There are many traces of this francization still today as on the pediment of the casa cavassa today transformed into a museum where you can read the motto \\"right whatever it is.\\" Main sights Chiesa di San Giovanni * (1491‚Äì1501): Church was built in Lombard-Gothic style. The fa√ßade is decorated with rose- windows, frescoes (almost totally faded) and statues. The interior contains a magnificent Baroque high altar, plus a 16th-century terracotta group portraying the Deposition, ad Adoration of the Shepherds by Sebastiano Ricci. *San Bernardo church formerly belonging to the Conventuals, has interesting tombs of the counts della Torre. *San Giovanni: Dominican church begun in 1330 in Gothic style and completed in 1504 with Bramantesque influences. The fa√ßade is Gothic. The apse, from 1504, houses a Funerary Chapel of Ludovico II, work by Antoine Le Moiturier (1425‚Äì74) covered with green stone and characterized by an elegant play of arches and sculptures. The sepulchre of Ludovico II is a Renaissance work by Benedetto Briosco. Annexed are the Gothic cloister and the Capitular Hall with the Mausoleum of a vicar-general of the marquisate, Galeazzo Cavassa di Carmagnola, a Renaissance work by Matteo Sanmicheli. *Casa Cavassa: site of the civic museum and rebuilt with a Renaissance interior. *San Agostino and San Bernardino *Town Hall is the former Jesuit College, while the older one (1462), with a bold tower, is utilized by the Court of Assizes.

Six children less than five years old, and nine children between six and 16 years of age were among the dead or missing, including six students on a championship team sent by schools in northern Mindanao to compete in a journalism contest. Bombing On the night of February 27, the 10,192-ton ferry sailed out of Manila for Cagayan de Oro City via Bacolod and Iloilo City with 899 recorded passengers and crew aboard. A television set containing a 3.6-kilogram (8-pound) TNT bomb had been placed on board in the lower, more-crowded decks. An hour after its 11 p.m. sailing, just off either El Fraile or Corregidor Island an explosion tore through the vessel, starting a fire that engulfed the ship and caused the confirmed deaths of 63 people while another 53 were recorded as missing and presumed dead. Captain Ceferino Manzo issued the order to abandon ship at about 1:30 a.m. As the fire spread across the vessel most of the survivors jumped into the sea or boarded rescue boats and, by February 29, officials had accounted for 565 of the 744 recorded passengers and all but two of the 155 crew members. In the days following the blast, the recovery of the dead and missing, calculated at around 180 on February 29, would be slow. Officials stated the missing may have been trapped inside the blazing ferry, have drowned in Manila Bay and that others may have been picked up by fishing boats. The recovery of bodies would take several months, with only four bodies recovered by Coast Guard divers from the half-submerged ferry in the first week, despite it having been towed to shallower waters near Mariveles town, west of Manila. At least another 12 bodies, some displaying blast injuries, were recovered by divers in the days up until the 7th. Eventually, 63 bodies would be recovered while another 53 would remain missing, presumed dead. Investigation Despite claims from various terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident, caused by a gas explosion, and sabotage was ruled out initially. However, at the marine board of inquiry hearing in late March 2004, a safety supervisor with the ship's owner, WG&A;, testified that about 150 survivors told him an explosion took place in the tourist section around the general area of bunk 51. The Captain of the ferry, Ceferino Manzo, testified in the same hearing that the entire tourist section was engulfed in \\"thick black smoke [that] smelled like gunpowder.\\" After divers righted the ferry, five months after it sank, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man named Redondo Cain Dellosa, a Rajah Sulaiman Movement member, confessed to planting a bomb, triggered by a timing device, on board for the Abu Sayyaf group. He held a ticket on the ferry for bunk 51B, where the bomb was placed, and disembarked before the ship's departure. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced on October 11, 2004, that investigators had concluded that the explosion had been caused by a bomb. She said six suspects had been arrested in connection with the bombing and that the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were still at large. It was believed that Abu Sayyaf bombed Superferry 14 because the company that owned it, WG&A;, did not comply with a letter demanding $1 million in protection money. Arrest and deportation Ruben Omar Pestano Lavilla, Jr., a listed terrorist of U.S. State Department, and founder of Philippine terror group Rajah Sulaiman Movement, was arrested in Bahrain on July 24, 2008. Anti-Terrorism Council Chairman Eduardo Ermita announced Lavilla, the alleged mastermind of the Superferry 14 bombing, was deported from Bahrain to the Philippines on August 30. Included in the sanctioned list of the United Nations Security Council, the RSM leader is also implicated in the February 14, 2005 bombings at Glorietta, and has pending murder case before the Makati City Regional Trial Court for the bombings.

For a given set of reaction conditions, the equilibrium constant is independent of the initial analytical concentrations of the reactant and product species in the mixture. Thus, given the initial composition of a system, known equilibrium constant values can be used to determine the composition of the system at equilibrium. However, reaction parameters like temperature, solvent, and ionic strength may all influence the value of the equilibrium constant. A knowledge of equilibrium constants is essential for the understanding of many chemical systems, as well as biochemical processes such as oxygen transport by hemoglobin in blood and acid-base homeostasis in the human body. Stability constants, formation constants, binding constants, association constants and dissociation constants are all types of equilibrium constants.  Basic definitions and properties  For a system undergoing a reversible reaction described by the general chemical equation : \\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\mathrm{A} + \\\\beta\\\\,\\\\mathrm{B} + \\\\cdots \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\rho\\\\,\\\\mathrm{R} + \\\\sigma\\\\,\\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\cdots a thermodynamic equilibrium constant, denoted by K^\\\\ominus, is defined to be the value of the reaction quotient Qt when forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. At chemical equilibrium, the chemical composition of the mixture does not change with time and the Gibbs free energy change \\\\Delta G for the reaction is zero. If the composition of a mixture at equilibrium is changed by addition of some reagent, a new equilibrium position will be reached, given enough time. An equilibrium constant is related to the composition of the mixture at equilibrium by IUPAC Gold Book. : K^\\\\ominus = \\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{R\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\rho \\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{S\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\sigma...}}{{\\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\beta...}} = \\\\frac{{{[\\\\mathrm{R}]}}^\\\\rho {{[\\\\mathrm{S}]}}^\\\\sigma ... } {{{[\\\\mathrm{A}]}}^\\\\alpha {{[\\\\mathrm{B}]}}^\\\\beta ...} \\\\times \\\\Gamma, : \\\\Gamma= \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_R^\\\\rho \\\\gamma_S^\\\\sigma...}{\\\\gamma_A^\\\\alpha \\\\gamma_B^\\\\beta...}, where {X} denotes the thermodynamic activity of reagent X at equilibrium, [X] the corresponding concentration, and Œ≥ the corresponding activity coefficient. If it can be assumed that the quotient of activity coefficients, \\\\Gamma, is constant over a range of experimental conditions, such as pH, then an equilibrium constant can be derived as a quotient of concentrations. : K_c = K^\\\\ominus/\\\\Gamma = \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{R}]^\\\\rho [\\\\mathrm{S}]^\\\\sigma ...}{[\\\\mathrm{A}]^\\\\alpha [\\\\mathrm{B}]^\\\\beta ...}. An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction \\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus by : \\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = -RT \\\\ln K^\\\\ominus, where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature (in kelvins), and ln is a natural logarithm. This expression implies that K^\\\\ominus must be a pure number and cannot have a dimension, since logarithms can only be taken of pure numbers. K_c must also be a pure number. On the other hand, the reaction quotient at equilibrium : \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{R}]^\\\\rho [\\\\mathrm{S}]^\\\\sigma ...}{[\\\\mathrm{A}]^\\\\alpha [\\\\mathrm{B}]^\\\\beta ...} (eq) does have the dimension of concentration raised to some power (see #Dimensionality, below). Such reaction quotients are often referred to, in the biochemical literature, as equilibrium constants. For an equilibrium mixture of gases, an equilibrium constant can be defined in terms of partial pressure or fugacity. An equilibrium constant is related to the forward and backward rate constants, kf and kr of the reactions involved in reaching equilibrium: : K^\\\\ominus = \\\\frac{k_\\\\text{f}}{k_\\\\text{r}}.  Types of equilibrium constants  = Cumulative and stepwise formation constants = A cumulative or overall constant, given the symbol Œ≤, is the constant for the formation of a complex from reagents. For example, the cumulative constant for the formation of ML2 is given by :M + 2 L ML2; [ML2] = Œ≤12[M][L]2 The stepwise constant, K, for the formation of the same complex from ML and L is given by :ML + L ML2; [ML2] = K[ML][L] = KŒ≤11[M][L]2 It follows that :Œ≤12 = KŒ≤11 A cumulative constant can always be expressed as the product of stepwise constants. There is no agreed notation for stepwise constants, though a symbol such as K is sometimes found in the literature. It is best always to define each stability constant by reference to an equilibrium expression.  Competition method  A particular use of a stepwise constant is in the determination of stability constant values outside the normal range for a given method. For example, EDTA complexes of many metals are outside the range for the potentiometric method. The stability constants for those complexes were determined by competition with a weaker ligand. :ML + L‚Ä≤ ML‚Ä≤ + L [\\\\mathrm{ML}']=K\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{ML}][\\\\mathrm{L}']}{[\\\\mathrm{L}]} = K \\\\frac{\\\\beta_\\\\mathrm{ML}[\\\\mathrm{M}][\\\\mathrm{L}][\\\\mathrm{L}']}{[\\\\mathrm{L}]}= K \\\\beta_\\\\mathrm{ML}[\\\\mathrm{M}][\\\\mathrm{L}']; \\\\quad \\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{ML}'}=K\\\\beta_\\\\mathrm{ML} The formation constant of [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí was determined by the competition method. = Association and dissociation constants = In organic chemistry and biochemistry it is customary to use pKa values for acid dissociation equilibria. :\\\\mathrm{p}K_\\\\mathrm{a}=-\\\\log K_{\\\\mathrm{diss}} = \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{K_\\\\mathrm{diss}}\\\\right)\\\\, where log denotes a logarithm to base 10 or common logarithm, and Kdiss is a stepwise acid dissociation constant. For bases, the base association constant, pKb is used. For any given acid or base the two constants are related by , so pKa can always be used in calculations. On the other hand, stability constants for metal complexes, and binding constants for host‚Äìguest complexes are generally expressed as association constants. When considering equilibria such as :M + HL ML + H it is customary to use association constants for both ML and HL. Also, in generalized computer programs dealing with equilibrium constants it is general practice to use cumulative constants rather than stepwise constants and to omit ionic charges from equilibrium expressions. For example, if NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid, N(CH2CO2H)3 is designated as H3L and forms complexes ML and MHL with a metal ion M, the following expressions would apply for the dissociation constants. :\\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\ce{H3L <=> {H2L} + H}; & \\\\ce{p}K_1=-\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{H2L}][\\\\ce{H}]} {[\\\\ce{H3L}]} \\\\right) \\\\ce{H2L <=> {HL} + H}; & \\\\ce{p}K_2=-\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HL}][\\\\ce{H}]} {[\\\\ce{H2L}]} \\\\right) \\\\ce{HL <=> {L} + H}; & \\\\ce{p}K_3=-\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{L}][\\\\ce{H}]} {[\\\\ce{HL}]} \\\\right) \\\\end{array} The cumulative association constants can be expressed as :\\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\ce{{L} + H <=> HL}; & \\\\log \\\\beta_{011} =\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HL}]}{[\\\\ce{L}][\\\\ce{H}]} \\\\right)=\\\\ce{p}K_3  \\\\ce{{L} + 2H <=> H2L}; & \\\\log \\\\beta_{012} =\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{H2L}]}{[\\\\ce{L}][\\\\ce{H}]^2} \\\\right)=\\\\ce{p}K_3+\\\\ce{p}K_2  \\\\ce{{L} + 3H <=> H3L}; & \\\\log \\\\beta_{013} =\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{H3L}]}{[\\\\ce{L}][\\\\ce{H}]^3} \\\\right)=\\\\ce{p}K_3+\\\\ce{p}K_2+\\\\ce{p}K_1  \\\\ce{{M} + L <=> ML}; & \\\\log \\\\beta_{110} =\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{ML}]}{[\\\\ce{M}][\\\\ce{L}]} \\\\right) \\\\ce{{M} + {L} + H <=> MLH}; & \\\\log \\\\beta_{111} =\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{MLH}]}{[\\\\ce{M}][\\\\ce{L}][\\\\ce{H}]} \\\\right) \\\\end{array} Note how the subscripts define the stoichiometry of the equilibrium product. = Micro- constants = When two or more sites in an asymmetrical molecule may be involved in an equilibrium reaction there are more than one possible equilibrium constants. For example, the molecule -DOPA has two non-equivalent hydroxyl groups which may be deprotonated. Denoting -DOPA as LH2, the following diagram shows all the species that may be formed (X = ). :300px The concentration of the species LH is equal to the sum of the concentrations of the two micro-species with the same chemical formula, labelled L1H and L2H. The constant K2 is for a reaction with these two micro-species as products, so that [LH] = [L1H] + [L2H] appears in the numerator, and it follows that this macro-constant is equal to the sum of the two micro-constants for the component reactions. :K2 = k21 \\\\+ k22 However, the constant K1 is for a reaction with these two micro-species as reactants, and [LH] = [L1H] + [L2H] in the denominator, so that in this case :1/K1 =1/ k11 \\\\+ 1/k12, and therefore K1 =k11 k12 / (k11 \\\\+ k12). Thus, in this example there are four micro- constants whose values are subject to two constraints; in consequence, only the two macro-constant values, for K1 and K2 can be derived from experimental data. Micro-constant values can, in principle, be determined using a spectroscopic technique, such as infrared spectroscopy, where each micro- species gives a different signal. Methods which have been used to estimate micro-constant values include * Chemical: blocking one of the sites, for example by methylation of a hydroxyl group, followed by determination of the equilibrium constant of the related molecule, from which the micro-constant value for the \\"parent\\" molecule may be estimated. * Mathematical: applying numerical procedures procedures to 13C NMR data. Although the value of a micro-constant cannot be determined from experimental data, site occupancy, which is proportional to the micro-constant value can be very important for biological activity. Therefore various methods have been developed for estimating micro-constant values. For example, the isomerization constant for -DOPA has been estimated to have a value of 0.9, so the micro-species L1H and L2H have almost equal concentrations at all pH values. = pH considerations (Br√∏nsted constants) = pH is defined in terms of the activity of the hydrogen ion :pH = ‚àílog10 {H+} In the approximation of ideal behaviour, activity is replaced by concentration. pH is measured by means of a glass electrode, a mixed equilibrium constant, also known as a Br√∏nsted constant, may result. :HL L + H; \\\\mathrm{p}K =-\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{L}]\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\\\\\}}{[\\\\mathrm{HL}]} \\\\right) It all depends on whether the electrode is calibrated by reference to solutions of known activity or known concentration. In the latter case the equilibrium constant would be a concentration quotient. If the electrode is calibrated in terms of known hydrogen ion concentrations it would be better to write p[H] rather than pH, but this suggestion is not generally adopted. = Hydrolysis constants = In aqueous solution the concentration of the hydroxide ion is related to the concentration of the hydrogen ion by :\\\\mathit{K}_W =[H][OH] :[OH]=\\\\mathit{K}_W[H]^{-1} The first step in metal ion hydrolysis can be expressed in two different ways :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\ce{M(H2O) <=> {M(OH)} + H}; &[\\\\ce{M(OH)}]=\\\\beta^*[\\\\ce{M}][\\\\ce{H}]^{-1}  \\\\ce{{M} + OH <=> M(OH)}; &[\\\\ce{M(OH)}]=K[\\\\ce{M}][\\\\ce{OH}]=K K_\\\\ce{W}[\\\\ce{M}][\\\\ce{H}]^{-1} \\\\end{cases} It follows that . Hydrolysis constants are usually reported in the Œ≤* form and therefore often have values much less than 1. For example, if and so that Œ≤* = 10‚àí10. In general when the hydrolysis product contains n hydroxide groups = Conditional constants = Conditional constants, also known as apparent constants, are concentration quotients which are not true equilibrium constants but can be derived from them. A very common instance is where pH is fixed at a particular value. For example, in the case of iron(III) interacting with EDTA, a conditional constant could be defined by :K_{\\\\mathrm{cond}}=\\\\frac{[\\\\mbox{Total Fe bound to EDTA}]}{[\\\\mbox{Total Fe not bound to EDTA}]\\\\times [\\\\mbox{Total EDTA not bound to Fe}] } This conditional constant will vary with pH. It has a maximum at a certain pH. That is the pH where the ligand sequesters the metal most effectively. In biochemistry equilibrium constants are often measured at a pH fixed by means of a buffer solution. Such constants are, by definition, conditional and different values may be obtained when using different buffers. = Gas-phase equilibria = For equilibria in a gas phase, fugacity, f, is used in place of activity. However, fugacity has the dimension of pressure, so it must be divided by a standard pressure, usually 1 bar, in order to produce a dimensionless quantity, . An equilibrium constant is expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantity. For example, for the equilibrium 2NO2 N2O4, :\\\\frac{f_\\\\mathrm{N_2O_4}}{p^\\\\ominus} = K \\\\left(\\\\frac{f_\\\\mathrm{NO_2}}{p^\\\\ominus}\\\\right)^2 Fugacity is related to partial pressure, p, by a dimensionless fugacity coefficient œï: f = œïp. Thus, for the example, :K=\\\\frac{\\\\phi_\\\\mathrm{N_2O_4} p_\\\\mathrm{N_2O_4}/{p^\\\\ominus}}{\\\\left(\\\\phi_\\\\mathrm{NO_2}p_\\\\mathrm{NO_2}/{p^\\\\ominus}\\\\right)^2} Usually the standard pressure is omitted from such expressions. Expressions for equilibrium constants in the gas phase then resemble the expression for solution equilibria with fugacity coefficient in place of activity coefficient and partial pressure in place of concentration. :K=\\\\frac{\\\\phi_\\\\mathrm{N_2O_4} p_\\\\mathrm{N_2O_4}}{\\\\left(\\\\phi_\\\\mathrm{NO_2}p_\\\\mathrm{NO_2}\\\\right)^2}  Thermodynamic basis for equilibrium constant expressions  Thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized by the free energy for the whole (closed) system being a minimum. For systems at constant temperature and pressure the Gibbs free energy is minimum. The slope of the reaction free energy with respect to the reaction coordinate, Œæ, is zero when the free energy is at its minimum value. :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial \\\\xi }\\\\right)_{T,P}=0 The free energy change, Œ¥Gr, can be expressed as a weighted sum of chemical potentials, the partial molar free energies of the species in equilibrium. The potential, Œºi, of the ith species in a chemical reaction is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the number of moles of that species, Ni :\\\\mu_i=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial N_i}\\\\right)_{T,P} A general chemical equilibrium can be written as :\\\\sum_j n_j \\\\mathrm{Reactant}_j \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\sum_k m_k \\\\mathrm{Product}_k where nj are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in the equilibrium equation, and mj are the coefficients of the products. At equilibrium :\\\\sum_k m_k \\\\mu_k = \\\\sum_j n_j \\\\mu_j The chemical potential, Œºi, of the ith species can be calculated in terms of its activity, ai. :\\\\mu_i = \\\\mu_i^\\\\ominus + RT \\\\ln a_i Œº is the standard chemical potential of the species, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. Setting the sum for the reactants j to be equal to the sum for the products, k, so that Œ¥Gr(Eq) = 0 :\\\\sum_j n_j(\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus +RT\\\\ln a_j)=\\\\sum_k m_k(\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus +RT\\\\ln a_k) Rearranging the terms, :\\\\sum_k m_k\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus-\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus =-RT \\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\ln {a_k}^{m_k}-\\\\sum_j \\\\ln {a_j}^{n_j}\\\\right) :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = -RT \\\\ln K. This relates the standard Gibbs free energy change, ŒîG ~~o~~ to an equilibrium constant, K, the reaction quotient of activity values at equilibrium. :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum_k m_k\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus-\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus :\\\\ln K= \\\\sum_k \\\\ln {a_k}^{m_k}-\\\\sum_j \\\\ln {a_j}^{n_j}; K=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k {a_k}^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j {a_j}^{n_j}} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{R}\\\\\\\\}} ^\\\\rho {\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\sigma ... } {{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{A}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\alpha {\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{B}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\beta ...} =Equivalence of thermodynamic and kinetic expressions for equilibrium constants= At equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the backward reaction rate. A simple reaction, such as ester hydrolysis :AB + H2O <=> AH + B(OH) has reaction rates given by expressions :\\\\text{forward rate} = k_f\\\\ce{[AB][H2O]} :\\\\text{backward rate} = k_b\\\\ce{[AH][B(OH)]} According to Guldberg and Waage, equilibrium is attained when the forward and backward reaction rates are equal to each other. In these circumstances, an equilibrium constant is defined to be equal to the ratio of the forward and backward reaction rate constants. :K=\\\\frac{k_f}{k_b}=\\\\frac\\\\ce{[AH][B(OH)]}\\\\ce{[AB][H2O]} For convenience the concentration of water may be taken to be constant, resulting in the simpler expression :K^c=\\\\frac\\\\ce{[AH][B(OH)]}\\\\ce{[AB]} This particular concentration quotient, K^c, has the dimension of concentration, but the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, , is always dimensionless.  Unknown activity coefficient values  Variation of log Kc of acetic acid with ionic strength It is very rare for activity coefficient values to have been determined experimentally for a system at equilibrium. There are three options for dealing with the situation where activity coefficient values are not known from experimental measurements. #Use calculated activity coefficients, together with concentrations of reactants. For equilibria in solution estimates of the activity coefficients of charged species can be obtained using Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory, an extended version, or SIT theory. For uncharged species, the activity coefficient Œ≥0 mostly follows a \\"salting-out\\" model: log10 Œ≥0 = bI where I stands for ionic strength. #Assume that the activity coefficients are all equal to 1. This is acceptable when all concentrations are very low. #For equilibria in solution use a medium of high ionic strength. In effect this redefines the standard state as referring to the medium. Activity coefficients in the standard state are, by definition, equal to 1. The value of an equilibrium constant determined in this manner is dependent on the ionic strength. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.  Dimensionality  An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change, \\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus , for the reaction by the expression :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = -RT \\\\ln K Therefore, K, must be a number from which a logarithm can be derived. In the case of a simple equilibrium :A + B <=> AB the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is defined in terms of the activities, {AB}, {A} and {B}, of the species in equilibrium with each other. :K = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{AB\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\}} Now, each activity term can be expressed as a product of a concentration [X] and a corresponding activity coefficient, \\\\gamma(X). Therefore, :K = \\\\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]}\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\gamma(AB)}{\\\\gamma(A)\\\\gamma(B)} = \\\\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]}\\\\times \\\\Gamma When the quotient of activity coefficients, \\\\Gamma is set equal to 1 :K = \\\\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]} K then appears to have the dimension of 1/concentration. This is what usually happens in practice when an equilibrium constant is calculated as a quotient of concentration values. The assumption underlying this practice is that the quotient of activities is constant under the conditions in which the equilibrium constant value is determined. These conditions are usually achieved by keeping the reaction temperature constant and by using a medium of relatively high ionic strength as the solvent. It is not unusual, particularly in texts relating to biochemical equilibria, to see a value quoted with a dimension. The justification for this practice is that the concentration scale used may be either mol dm‚àí3 or mmol dm‚àí3, so that the concentration unit has to be stated in order to avoid there being any ambiguity. Note. When the concentration values are measured on the mole fraction scale all concentrations and activity coefficients are dimensionless quantities. In general equilibria between two reagents can be expressed as :{\\\\mathit{p}A} + \\\\mathit{q}B <=> A_\\\\mathit{p}B_\\\\mathit{q} in which case the equilibrium constant is defined, in terms of numerical concentration values, as :K = \\\\frac{[\\\\ce{A}_p\\\\ce{B}_q]}{[\\\\ce A]^p[\\\\ce B]^q} The apparent dimension of this K value is concentration1‚àíp‚àíq; this may be written as M(1‚àíp‚àíq) or mM(1‚àíp‚àíq), where the symbol M signifies a molar concentration (). The apparent dimension of a dissociation constant is the reciprocal of the apparent dimension of the corresponding association constant, and vice versa. When discussing the thermodynamics of chemical equilibria it is necessary to take dimensionality into account. There are two possible approaches. # Set the dimension of to be the reciprocal of the dimension of the concentration quotient. This is almost universal practice in the field of stability constant determinations. The \\"equilibrium constant\\" \\\\frac{K}{\\\\Gamma}, is dimensionless. It will be a function of the ionic strength of the medium used for the determination. Setting the numerical value of to be 1 is equivalent to re-defining the standard states. # Replace each concentration term [X] by the dimensionless quotient \\\\frac{[X]}{[X^0]}, where [X^0] is the concentration of reagent in its standard state. By definition the numerical value of \\\\gamma(X^0) is 1, so also has a numerical value of 1. In both approaches the numerical value of the stability constant is unchanged. The first is more useful for practical purposes; in fact, the unit of the concentration quotient is often attached to a published stability constant value in the biochemical literature. The second approach is consistent with the standard exposition of Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory, where \\\\gamma(AB), etc. are taken to be pure numbers. Water as both reactant and solvent For reactions in aqueous solution, such as an acid dissociation reaction :AH + H2O A‚àí \\\\+ H3O+ the concentration of water may be taken as being constant and the formation of the hydronium ion is implicit. :AH A‚àí \\\\+ H+ Water concentration is omitted from expressions defining equilibrium constants, except when solutions are very concentrated. :K=\\\\frac{[A][H]}{[AH]} (K defined as a dissociation constant) Similar considerations apply to metal ion hydrolysis reactions.  Enthalpy and entropy: temperature dependence  If both the equilibrium constant, K and the standard enthalpy change, \\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus, for a reaction have been determined experimentally, the standard entropy change for the reaction is easily derived. Since \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta H - T \\\\Delta S and \\\\Delta G = -RT \\\\ln K :\\\\Delta S^\\\\ominus = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus + RT \\\\ln K}{T} To a first approximation the standard enthalpy change is independent of temperature. Using this approximation, definite integration of the van 't Hoff equation :\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus=-R\\\\frac{d \\\\ln K}{d(1/T)}\\\\ gives :\\\\ln K_2 = \\\\ln K_1 -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{R} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{T_2}-\\\\frac{1}{T_1}\\\\right) This equation can be used to calculate the value of log K at a temperature, T2, knowing the value at temperature T1. The van 't Hoff equation also shows that, for an exothermic reaction ( \\\\Delta H <0), when temperature increases K decreases and when temperature decreases K increases, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle. The reverse applies when the reaction is endothermic. When K has been determined at more than two temperatures, a straight line fitting procedure may be applied to a plot of \\\\ln K against 1/T to obtain a value for \\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus . Error propagation theory can be used to show that, with this procedure, the error on the calculated \\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus value is much greater than the error on individual log K values. Consequently, K needs to be determined to high precision when using this method. For example, with a silver ion-selective electrode each log K value was determined with a precision of ca. 0.001 and the method was applied successfully. Standard thermodynamic arguments can be used to show that, more generally, enthalpy will change with temperature. :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial T} \\\\right)_p=C_p where Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure. = A more complex formulation = The calculation of K at a particular temperature from a known K at another given temperature can be approached as follows if standard thermodynamic properties are available. The effect of temperature on equilibrium constant is equivalent to the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy because: :\\\\ln K = {{-\\\\Delta_\\\\mathrm{r} G^\\\\ominus} \\\\over {RT}} where ŒîrG ~~o~~ is the reaction standard Gibbs energy, which is the sum of the standard Gibbs energies of the reaction products minus the sum of standard Gibbs energies of reactants. Here, the term \\"standard\\" denotes the ideal behaviour (i.e., an infinite dilution) and a hypothetical standard concentration (typically 1 mol/kg). It does not imply any particular temperature or pressure because, although contrary to IUPAC recommendation, it is more convenient when describing aqueous systems over wide temperature and pressure ranges. The standard Gibbs energy (for each species or for the entire reaction) can be represented (from the basic definitions) as: :G_{T_2}^\\\\ominus = G_{T_1}^\\\\ominus-S_{T_1}^\\\\ominus(T_2-T_1)-T_2 \\\\int^{T_2}_{T_1} {{C_p^\\\\ominus} \\\\over {T}}\\\\,dT + \\\\int^{T_2}_{T_1} C_p^\\\\ominus\\\\,dT In the above equation, the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy (and thus on the equilibrium constant) is ascribed entirely to heat capacity. To evaluate the integrals in this equation, the form of the dependence of heat capacity on temperature needs to be known. If the standard molar heat capacity C can be approximated by some analytic function of temperature (e.g. the Shomate equation), then the integrals involved in calculating other parameters may be solved to yield analytic expressions for them. For example, using approximations of the following forms: *For pure substances (solids, gas, liquid): :C_p^\\\\ominus \\\\approx A + BT + CT^{-2} *For ionic species at : :C_p^\\\\ominus \\\\approx (4.186a+b\\\\breve{S}^\\\\ominus_{T_1}) {{(T_2-T_1)} \\\\over {\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\\\right)}} then the integrals can be evaluated and the following final form is obtained: :G_{T_2}^\\\\ominus \\\\approx G_{T_1}^\\\\ominus + (C_p^\\\\ominus - S_{T_1}^\\\\ominus)(T_2-T_1) - T_2 \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\\\right)C_p^\\\\ominus The constants A, B, C, a, b and the absolute entropy, SÃÜ, required for evaluation of C(T), as well as the values of G298 K and S298 K for many species are tabulated in the literature.  Pressure dependence  The pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is usually weak in the range of pressures normally encountered in industry, and therefore, it is usually neglected in practice. This is true for condensed reactant/products (i.e., when reactants and products are solids or liquid) as well as gaseous ones. For a gaseous-reaction example, one may consider the well-studied reaction of hydrogen with nitrogen to produce ammonia: :N2 \\\\+ 3 H2 2 NH3 If the pressure is increased by the addition of an inert gas, then neither the composition at equilibrium nor the equilibrium constant are appreciably affected (because the partial pressures remain constant, assuming an ideal-gas behaviour of all gases involved). However, the composition at equilibrium will depend appreciably on pressure when: * the pressure is changed by compression or expansion of the gaseous reacting system, and * the reaction results in the change of the number of moles of gas in the system. In the example reaction above, the number of moles changes from 4 to 2, and an increase of pressure by system compression will result in appreciably more ammonia in the equilibrium mixture. In the general case of a gaseous reaction: :Œ± A + Œ≤ B œÉ S + œÑ T the change of mixture composition with pressure can be quantified using: :K_p = \\\\frac{{p_\\\\mathrm{S}}^\\\\sigma {p_\\\\mathrm{T}}^\\\\tau} {{p_\\\\mathrm{A}}^\\\\alpha {p_\\\\mathrm{B}}^\\\\beta} = \\\\frac{{X_\\\\mathrm{S}}^\\\\sigma {X_\\\\mathrm{T}}^\\\\tau} {{X_\\\\mathrm{A}}^\\\\alpha {X_\\\\mathrm{B}}^\\\\beta} P^{\\\\sigma+\\\\tau-\\\\alpha-\\\\beta} = K_X P^{\\\\sigma+\\\\tau-\\\\alpha-\\\\beta} where p denote the partial pressures and X the mole fractions of the components, P is the total system pressure, Kp is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures and KX is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of mole fractions. The above change in composition is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle and does not involve any change of the equilibrium constant with the total system pressure. Indeed, for ideal-gas reactions Kp is independent of pressure. Pressure dependence of the water ionization constant at 25 ¬∞C. In general, ionization in aqueous solutions tends to increase with increasing pressure. In a condensed phase, the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is associated with the reaction volume. For reaction: :Œ± A + Œ≤ B œÉ S + œÑ T the reaction volume is: :\\\\Delta \\\\bar{V} = \\\\sigma \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\tau \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{T} - \\\\alpha \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{A} - \\\\beta \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{B} where VÃÑ denotes a partial molar volume of a reactant or a product. For the above reaction, one can expect the change of the reaction equilibrium constant (based either on mole-fraction or molal- concentration scale) with pressure at constant temperature to be: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ln K_X}{\\\\partial P} \\\\right)_T = \\\\frac{-\\\\Delta \\\\bar{V}} {RT}. The matter is complicated as partial molar volume is itself dependent on pressure. Effect of isotopic substitution Isotopic substitution can lead to changes in the values of equilibrium constants, especially if hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (or tritium).Laidler K.J. Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987), p.428‚Äì433 This equilibrium isotope effect is analogous to the kinetic isotope effect on rate constants, and is primarily due to the change in zero-point vibrational energy of H‚ÄìX bonds due to the change in mass upon isotopic substitution. The zero-point energy is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the vibrating hydrogen atom, and will therefore be smaller for a D‚ÄìX bond that for an H‚ÄìX bond. An example is a hydrogen atom abstraction reaction R' + H‚ÄìR R'‚ÄìH + R with equilibrium constant KH, where R' and R are organic radicals such that R' forms a stronger bond to hydrogen than does R. The decrease in zero-point energy due to deuterium substitution will then be more important for R'‚ÄìH than for R‚ÄìH, and R'‚ÄìD will be stabilized more than R‚ÄìD, so that the equilibrium constant KD for R' + D‚ÄìR R'‚ÄìD + R is greater than KH. This is summarized in the rule the heavier atom favors the stronger bond. Similar effects occur in solution for acid dissociation constants (Ka) which describe the transfer of H+ or D+ from a weak aqueous acid to a solvent molecule: HA + H2O = H3O+ \\\\+ A‚àí or DA + D2O D3O+ \\\\+ A‚àí. The deuterated acid is studied in heavy water, since if it were dissolved in ordinary water the deuterium would rapidly exchange with hydrogen in the solvent. The product species H3O+ (or D3O+) is a stronger acid than the solute acid, so that it dissociates more easily and its H‚ÄìO (or D‚ÄìO) bond is weaker than the H‚ÄìA (or D‚ÄìA) bond of the solute acid. The decrease in zero-point energy due to isotopic substitution is therefore less important in D3O+ than in DA so that KD < KH, and the deuterated acid in D2O is weaker than the non-deuterated acid in H2O. In many cases the difference of logarithmic constants pKD ‚Äì pKH is about 0.6, so that the pD corresponding to 50% dissociation of the deuterated acid is about 0.6 units higher than the pH for 50% dissociation of the non- deuterated acid.

In the background the Acropolis of Athens is silhouetted against a fiery sky, and by Taylor's left hand is a copy of his translation of the works of Plato.Artwork Page: Thomas Taylor Lawrence's painting of Taylor is described Thomas Taylor (15 May 17581 November 1835) was an English translator and Neoplatonist, the first to translate into English the complete works of Aristotle and of Plato, as well as the Orphic fragments. Biography Thomas Taylor was born in the City of London on 15 May 1758, the son of a staymaker Joseph Taylor and his wife Mary (born Summers). He was educated at St. Paul's School, and devoted himself to the study of the classics and of mathematics. After first working as a clerk in Lubbock's Bank, he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Art (precursor to the Royal Society of Arts), in which capacity he made many influential friends, who furnished the means for publishing his various translations, which besides Plato and Aristotle, include Proclus, Porphyry, Apuleius, Ocellus Lucanus and other Neoplatonists and Pythagoreans. His aim was the translation of all the untranslated writings of the ancient Greek philosophers. Taylor was an admirer of Hellenism, most especially in the philosophical framework furnished by Plato and the Neoplatonists Proclus and the \\"most divine\\" Iamblichus, whose works he translated into English. So enamoured was he of the ancients, that he and his wife talked to one another only in classical Greek. He was also an outspoken voice against corruption in the Christianity of his day, and what he viewed as its shallowness. Taylor was ridiculed and acquired many enemies, but in other quarters he was well received. Among his friends was the eccentric traveller and philosopher John \\"Walking\\" Stewart, whose gatherings Taylor was in the habit of attending. Family Taylor married his childhood sweetheart Mary Morton, daughter of John Morton, in 1777, and they had children George Burrow Taylor (born 1779), John Buller Taylor (1781), William Grainger Taylor (1783-1785), Mary Joseph Taylor (1789) and Thomas Taylor (1791). Their eldest daughter, Mary Meredith Taylor (1787‚Äì1861), was named after his generous patron William Meredith and married a haberdasher, Samuel Beverly Jones. His wife Mary died in 1809. He married again, and his second wife Susannah died in 1823. From his second marriage he had one son, Thomas Proclus Taylor (born 1816). Thomas Taylor died in Walworth. Influence The texts that he used had been edited since the 16th century, but were interrupted by lacunae; Taylor's understanding of the Platonists informed his suggested emendations. His translations were influential on William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and William Wordsworth. In American editions they were read by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott, and G. R. S. Mead, secretary to Helena Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society. Taylor also published several original works on philosophy (in particular, the Neoplatonism of Proclus and Iamblichus) and mathematics. These works have been republished (some for the first time since Taylor's lifetime) by the Prometheus Trust. It appears that he and his wife were landlords at Walworth in the late 1770s to a family that included the 18-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft; it is not clear whether the future author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman actually knew the Taylors, as at that age she left home for a job as a lady's companion.

DeVille (born Bruce Anthony Johannesson; May 14, 1962) is the lead guitarist of the multi-platinum-selling rock band Poison. His work with the band has sold over 45 million records worldwide, including 15 million in the United States. He named himself after his favorite car, the Cadillac Coupe Deville. He has also acted in both reality television and television drama shows. He starred in The Surreal Life season 6 and The Surreal Life: Fame Games. DeVille also formed a band in 1998 called Samantha 7. In 2015, DeVille was ranked at number one by VH1 as the most underrated hair metal guitarist of the '80s.VH1+ Music Early years DeVille was born Bruce Anthony Johannesson in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, New York. DeVille began playing the guitar at the age of five after he was given a $27 Japanese Telecaster copy. As his love of music grew, he began listening to bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Aerosmith, Van Halen, the Who, Cheap Trick, New York Dolls, Queen, and especially Kiss. He trained at The Julliard School. At the age of 18, DeVille auditioned for and eventually joined the band Lace based in Boro Park Brooklyn, NY, which adopted a highly sexual, \\"glam\\" image. It was during this time period that DeVille began writing the song \\"Talk Dirty To Me\\", which would later appear on Poison's first album, Look What the Cat Dragged In. DeVille began studying music theory at New York University, but never completed his studies. Instead, he moved to Los Angeles in 1981 and played in various bands, including Screaming Mimi, Lace Slip, and St. James, before auditioning for Poison. Musical career DeVille's audition impressed drummer Rikki Rockett and bassist Bobby Dall, but angered vocalist Bret Michaels. DeVille refused to play the songs that had been given to him as preparation, and instead jammed with a guitar riff he had written. The riff, which would eventually be featured in the Poison single \\"Talk Dirty to Me\\", would ultimately launch the band's career. Slash, who would go on to fame with Guns N' Roses, also auditioned for the position and made it to the final three, but lost to DeVille; In his autobiography Slash acknowledged discomfort with Poison's image when Rikki Rockett suggested that Slash wear make-up and change his clothing style. DeVille co-wrote Poison's debut album with Bret Michaels, Bobby Dall, and Rikki Rockett. Look What the Cat Dragged In was released on August 2, 1986. It included the hits \\"Talk Dirty to Me\\", \\"I Want Action\\", and \\"I Won't Forget You\\". Sales for the album topped 3 million copies in the United States. DeVille also wrote much of the material for Poison's second album, the multi-platinum selling Open Up And Say... Ahh!, which was released on May 21, 1988 and would ultimately go on to sell 8 million copies worldwide. It included the hit song \\"Nothin' But a Good Time\\", co-written by DeVille, and Poison's only number 1 single \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\". In 1990, Poison released the multi-platinum selling Flesh & Blood, an album which was again largely written by DeVille. =Leaving Poison= While touring in support of Flesh and Blood, and despite Poison's success, substance abuse and tensions with other members of the band, particularly lead singer Bret Michaels, led to conflict within the band. Leading up to the release of the live album Swallow This Live conflict between Michaels and DeVille culminated in a fistfight backstage at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards after DeVille played the wrong song, playing \\"Talk Dirty To Me\\" instead of \\"Unskinny Bop\\", and being high and intoxicated during the performance. Asked to quit, DeVille left Poison and was replaced by guitarist Richie Kotzen. Following his departure from Poison, DeVille formed Needle Park, a band that also featured vocalist Kelly Hansen, bassist Tommy Henriksen, and drummer James Kottak, and recorded \\"Hey, Good Lookin'\\" for the soundtrack to the Pauly Shore movie Son in Law. =Samantha 7= Samantha 7 was a short-lived band composed of guitarist DeVille, guitarist Ty Longley, bassist Krys Baratto, and drummer Francis Ruiz. They played at Woodstock 1999. Originally the band's name was The Stepmothers, but the band was forced to change their name following a legal dispute with another band of the same name. DeVille can be heard referring to this band as The Stepmothers in a Behind the Music interview. Samantha 7 released the self-titled album Samantha 7 in 2000, and toured the US and UK in support of the record that was released on Columbia/Portrait Records. The Samantha 7 song \\"I Wanna be Famous\\" would later be used in the opening of the reality show The Surreal Life: Fame Games, in which DeVille starred. =Return to Poison= DeVille regained contact with his Poison bandmates in 1996 for their Greatest Hits reunion tour in 1999. Several shows were recorded and released as a hybrid studio & live album release in 2000 titled Power to the People. DeVille continues to record and perform with Poison. Television In 2005 and 2006, DeVille starred in a popular TV series South of Nowhere on The N. He played the role of Raife Davies, the father of Ashley Davies and Kyla Woods. Also in 2006 when Poison celebrated their 20th anniversary, DeVille starred in The Surreal Life on VH1. He also starred in the spin-off series The Surreal Life: Fame Games in 2007. In 2002, DeVille had a brief cameo appearance as \\"Lloyd\\", a member of the airband GFK Groovecart, on the last episode of season 6 of Just Shoot Me! (titled \\"The Boys In The Band\\"). Family In March 2007, DeVille and his girlfriend Shannon Malone became parents with the birth of Vallon Deville Johannesson. Parodies In 2001, DeVille became the inspiration for rock & roll comic C.C. Banana. A twisted homage to DeVille, C.C. Banana speaks in a cartoonish parody of DeVille's voice and wears a large yellow banana costume. C.C. Banana has interviewed numerous rock stars and made many TV appearances. Parody act Beatallica mentioned C.C. in the song \\"I want to choke your band\\", the theme of which pits heavy metal bands against glam metal like Warrant, Poison, and Whitesnake. The lyric goes \\"No mercy for C.C., 'cuz he's in a hair band\\". Discography ;Solo * 1993 - C.C.

Unlike traditional arts expression, the process of creation is emphasized rather than the final product. The expressive therapies are based on the assumption that people can heal through the various forms of creative expression. Expressive therapists share the belief that through creative expression and the tapping of the imagination, people can examine their body, feelings, emotions, and thought process. Definition and credentialing Expressive arts therapy is the practice of using imagery, storytelling, dance, music, drama, poetry, movement, horticulture, dreamwork, and visual arts together, in an integrated way, to foster human growth, development, and healing.Appalachian Expressive Arts Collective, 2003, Expressive Arts Therapy: Creative Process in Art and Life. Boone, North Carolina: Parkway Publishers. p. 3. Expressive arts therapy is its own distinct therapeutic discipline, an inter-modal discipline where the therapist and client move freely between drawing, dancing, music, drama, and poetry. According to the National Organization for Arts in Health (NOAH), what distinguishes the six creative arts therapies ‚Äî art, dance/movement, drama, music and poetry therapy as well as psychodrama‚Äîfrom expressive arts therapy is that expressive arts therapy interventions are designed to include more than one of the \\"expressive\\" art forms (art, dance, drama, music, poetry), whereas creative arts therapists, such as art, dance/movement, drama, music, poetry and psychodrama therapists, are often intensively trained and educated to use only one modality in their practice. But NOAH also acknowledged that the terms \\"are often used interchangeably in the field\\", and that in any case all such professionals should collaborate closely. The International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (IEATA) is the responsible organization handling the credentialing of expressive arts therapists. The National Coalition of Creative Arts Therapies Association (NCCATA) connects all six modalities of the creative arts therapies. However, each modality of the creative arts therapies has its own national association that regulates professional credentials, establishes educational standards and hosts annual conferences for the purpose of exchanging new ideas and research. Education Each national association of the different modalities of expressive therapies sets its own educational standards. In the United States, there are a fair number of colleges that offer approved programs in compliance with the national associations' credentialing requirements. There are 37 universities for music therapy, 34 universities for art therapy, seven universities for dance/movement therapy, and five universities for drama therapy, as well as 5 universities for expressive arts therapy, that have approved master's degree programs in the United States. In addition, the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has 75 undergraduate music therapy programs approved. Once finished with an academic degree, potential therapists have to apply for credentialing at the responsible national association. Creative arts therapies modalities There are six creative arts therapy modalities, recognized by the NCCATA, including art therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, poetry therapy and psychodrama. = Art therapy = Art therapy combines psychotherapy and visual art. The creative process as well as the created art piece serves as a foundation for self-exploration, understanding, acceptance and eventually healing and personal growth. The creative act in therapy therefore can be seen as a means of re-experiencing inner conflict connected to resolution. = Dance/movement therapy = Like other creative arts therapy modalities, dance/movement therapy is based on the assumption that \\"mind, body and spirit are inseparable and interconnected\\" (ADTA). Movement is the primary tool of intervention in a therapy session, but dance/movement therapy also uses the art of play in therapy. Like other creative art therapies it uses primarily nonverbal communication. = Drama therapy = Drama therapy refers to the combination of the two disciplines drama/theatre and psychotherapy. Drama Therapy, as a hybrid of both disciplines, uses theater techniques to treat individuals with mental health, cognitive, and developmental disorders. Through the art of play and pretend, patients gain perspective in therapy to their life experiences, which in the field is referred to as \\"aesthetic distance\\". = Music therapy = Music therapy is the use of music and music-making in a psychotherapeutic relationship, making it a musical therapeutic relationship. At its core, music therapy uses music as a symbolic representation and expression of the psychological world of the individual. Music therapy helps patients \\"communicate, process difficult experiences, and improve motor or cognitive functioning\\" (Jenni Rook, MT-BC, LCPC, 2016). = Poetry therapy = Poetry therapy (also referred to using the broader term bibliotherapy) stands out from other creative arts therapies, which are all based on the assumption of the existence of a language that functions without words. Poetry therapy, however, is the use of the written word to bring healing and personal growth. = Psychodrama = Psychodrama is a distinct form of psychotherapy developed by Jacob L. Moreno in the early 20th century. Moreno, a trained psychoanalyst himself, had the goal of creating a more effective, action-based form of psychoanalysis as developed by Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung. He developed a clear three phase structure (warm up, action, sharing) to his therapy as well as multiple intervention-methods that are still used by psychodrama therapists today. Although related, psychodrama and drama therapy describe different modalities within the field of creative arts therapies. Whereas psychodrama uses real-life experience of the patients in therapy to \\"practice new and more effective roles and behaviors\\" (ASGPP), drama therapy lets the patients explore more fictional stories, such as improvised scenes, myths or fairy tales.

The fragmentary remains were originally described as a theropod but later publications listed it as a sauropod. Estimates by researchers exceed those of the titanosaur Argentinosaurus, as longer than and weighing over 80 tons. All the estimates are based on the dimensions of the fossils described in Yadagiri and Ayyasami's 1987 paper, which announced the find. In 2017 it was reported that the original fossils had disintegrated and no longer exist.  Discovery  Bruhathkayosaurus was found near the southern tip of India, specifically in the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu, to the northeast of Kallamedu village. It was recovered from the rocks of the Kallemedu Formation, which are dated to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago. The fossilized remains include hip bones (the ilium and ischium), part of a leg bone (femur), a shin bone (tibia), a forearm (radius) and a tail bone (part of a vertebra, specifically a platycoelous caudal centrum). The remains were originally classified as belonging to a carnosaur.Yadagiri, P. and Ayyasami, K. (1987). \\"A carnosaurian dinosaur from the Kallamedu Formation (Maestrichtian horizon), Tamilnadu.\\" In M.V.A. Sastry, V.V. Sastry, C.G.K. Ramanujam, H.M. Kapoor, B.R. Jagannatha Rao, P.P. Satsangi, and U.B. Mathur (eds.), Three Decades of Development in Palaeontology and Stratigraphy in India. Volume 1. Precambrian to Mesozoic. Geological Society of India Special Publication, 11(1): 523-528. The name chosen, Bruhathkayosaurus, is derived from Sanskrit word Bruhathkaya (b·πõhat , 'huge, heavy' and kƒÅya, ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø 'body'), plus the Greek sauros (lizard).Schneiderman, P. (Nov 1994). \\"Report on the initial description\\". Dinosaur Mailing List The monsoon season combined with the sands and clays of the Kallemedu Formation creates water saturated fossils which are very friable. During the dry season expansion during the day and contraction during the night can cause fossils to split apart. This makes bones poorly preserved and can be impossible to extract without breaking apart. In 2017, Galton and Ayyasami reported that the Bruhathkayosaurus fossils started to disintegrate inside their field jackets before reaching the Geological Survey of India (GSIH) and no longer exist.  Classification  The type species, Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi, is based on the holotype specimen GSI PAL/SR/20, which was described by Yadagiri and Ayyasami in 1987 (not 1989, as some sources indicate). It was originally classified as a carnosaur (like Allosaurus), of an uncertain position (incertae sedis). However, Chatterjee (1995) re-examined the remains and demonstrated that Bruhathkayosaurus is actually a titanosaur sauropod.Chatterjee, S. (1995). \\"The last dinosaurs of India\\". The Dinosaur Report, Fall 1995. p. 12-18. Later studies have listed Bruhathkayosaurus as an indeterminate sauropod or as a nomen dubium.Upchurch, P., Barrett, P. M. and Dodson, P. 2004.

(2006). \\"Late Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrates from Madagascar: Implications for Latin American biogeography.\\" Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 93(2): 178-208. The original publication described little in the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by a few line drawings and photographs of the fossils as they lay in the ground. This led to online speculation by researchers that the bones might actually be petrified wood, akin to the way the original discoverers of Sauroposeidon initially believed their find to be fossilized tree trunks.Holtz, T.

The only known remains of Bruhathkayosaurus have been lost so the validity of the genus and any size estimates are questionable.  Size estimates  According to the published description, the shin bone (tibia) of Bruhathkayosaurus was long. This is 29 percent larger than the tibia of Argentinosaurus, which is only long. The fragmentary femur was similarly huge; across the distal end, it measured , 33% larger than the femur of Antarctosaurus giganteus, which measures . The illium measured in length. No total body size estimates for Bruhathkayosaurus have been published, but paleontologists and researchers have posted tentative estimates on the Internet. In a post from June 2001, Mickey Mortimer estimated that Bruhathkayosaurus could have reached in length and might have weighed , but in later posts retracted these estimates, reducing the estimated length of Bruhathkayosaurus to based on more complete titanosaurs (Saltasaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia and Rapetosaurus), and declined to provide a new weight estimate, describing the older weight estimates as inaccurate.Mortimer, M. (2001), \\"Re: Bruhathkayosaurus\\", discussion group, The Dinosaur Mailing List, 19 June 2001. Accessed 23 May 2008.Mortimer, M.

In a May 2008 article for the weblog Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week, paleontologist Matt Wedel used a comparison with Argentinosaurus and calculated the weight of Bruhathkayosaurus at up to .Wedel, M. \\"SV-POW! showdown: sauropods vs whales.\\" [Weblog entry.] Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week. 20 May 2008. Accessed 23 May 2008. In 2019 Gregory S. Paul suggested that the supposed tibia is probably a degraded femur, in which case its length was slightly greater than that of Dreadnoughtus (1.91 meters) and Futalognkosaurus (1.98 meters). Its ilium is similar in length to that of Dreadnoughtus whereas the width of the distal femur appears to slightly exceed that of Patagotitan. So he estimated its mass between much lower than any previous estimation. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi suggested that the long tibia is probably a fibula, and estimated the size of the animal (if it really existed) at and . By comparison, the titanosaur Argentinosaurus is estimated to have reached in length, and to have weighed 65‚Äì100 tonnes. These sauropods are known only from partial or fragmentary remains, so the size estimates are uncertain. Length is calculated by comparing existing bones to the bones of similar dinosaurs, which are known from more complete skeletons and scaling them up isometrically. However, such extrapolation can never be more than an educated guess and the length of the tail, in particular, is often hard to judge. Determining mass is even more difficult because little evidence of soft tissues survives in the fossil record. In addition, isometric scaling is based on the assumption that body proportions remain the same, which is not necessarily the case. In particular, the proportions of the titanosaurs are not well known, due to a limited number of relatively complete specimens. If the upper size estimates for Bruhathkayosaurus are accurate it would be similar in size to the blue whale. Mature blue whales can reach in length and the record-holder blue whale was recorded at . Another poorly known sauropod that shares similar size estimates to Bruhathkayosaurus is Maraapunisaurus fragillimus, which was based on a now-missing dorsal vertebra. In 2006 Kenneth Carpenter used Diplodocus as a guide and estimated Maraapunisaurus to be in length and weigh only about .Carpenter, K.

It is sort of a parallel concept to sea control and can be a quite confusing concept. The two concepts: sea control and sea denial are not mutually opposing, but whereas the object of sea control is to use the sea for oneself, the object of sea denial seeks to deny the enemy effective use of the sea. According to Corbett the object of sea denial, therefore, is negative. And the naval strategy is defensive in nature. It is a less ambitious strategy than sea control and is often carried out by the weaker power as it requires less power (Corbett 2018, p. 144). Sea denial can be viewed as an alternative to sea control but it can also work in consort with sea control. A navy is bound to have different objectives across different theatres of operations, especially larger navies. It is possible to pursue sea denial in one area of operation while at the same time pursuing sea control in another. Sea denial can even act as a direct compliment to sea control. It is possible for a nation to aspire to a high degree of sea control in their littorals, whilst at the same time pursuing sea denial outside the littorals, as was seen with the Soviet Union during periods of the cold war. This kind of zone defence strategy is popularly called Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) in modern terms (Till 2018, p. 193 ‚Äì 197; Speller 2019, p. 118 ‚Äì 132). Sea denial is achieved in many different ways. The method chosen might depend on various different factors such as geography, ambition and capabilities being some of the key factors. Geographically it is easier to conduct sea denial operations in choke points (narrow waters, straights or congested waters for instance) or one‚Äôs own littorals. In relation to ambition it is important to be mindful of the objective, both one‚Äôs own and the oppositions. The greater an oppositions dependency on the sea the greater the effect of successful sea denial operations. In order to succeed with sea denial operations, the right capabilities are needed, some examples are naval mines, anti-ship missiles and submarines. The greater the capabilities the greater the chance of success. All this translates in to different activities with sea denial as its object. These range from barrier operations that seek to hinder access to certain areas, commerce raiding that require the enemy to put resources into escorting and thus disputing sea control, asymmetrical warfare and skirmishes on military vessels that disputes sea control or by maintaining a fleet in being that threatens offensive operations without actually conducting them (Speller 2019, p. 118 - 132). During World War I and World War II, Germany pursued sea denial using U-boats. Owing to the substantial superiority of the Royal Navy's surface forces, Germany's Imperial Navy (in World War I) and Kriegsmarine (in World War II) had little hope of seizing control of the high seas, but with submarines the Germans could hope to defeat the British by choking off their crucial access to seaborne commerce. In both wars, the United Kingdom successfully resisted the German strategy with a combination of strict rationing and the development of anti-submarine weapons and techniques. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union invested heavily in submarines and would likely have pursued a similar strategy of sea denial had tensions with the NATO powers escalated to open warfare. Since World War II, the most historically notable instance of a sea denial strategy being attempted involved the so- called 'Tanker War,' wherein Iran and Iraq sought to close the Persian Gulf. Today the term A2/AD has gained a lot of traction, and refers to a sort sea denial strategy where a state aspires to challenge access to certain areas and at the same time hinder the freedom of movement in an adjacent area. It can include a combined effort of the navy air force and army. The army deploying missiles and sensors in an effort to produce effective coastal defensive moats. The air force deploying assets that can support intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance and even targeting ships with airborne weaponry. The navy deploying all its assets in a layered defence using everything from sea mines, surface combatants to submarines in a system of layered defence and distributed lethality (Till 2018, p. 193 ‚Äì 197). Modern sea denial relates to the area denial weapon, for example in the context of a land power using land-based missiles to strike sea targets. Such missiles can follow cruise missile (terrain-skimming) or ballistic missile trajectories. In response to these threats, the U.S. Navy has developed the Littoral Combat Ship.

History The AMOU traces its roots to the formation of the Mercantile Marine Officers' Association in the 1880s. The MMOA was one of the key unions involved in the 1890 Australian maritime dispute that began on 15 August 1890 and ended when members returned to work on the employers' terms in November 1890. A general meeting of the MMOA on 12 February 1904 changed the name of the union to Merchant Service Guild of Australasia. The Guild registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act on 5 May 1905, the first registered federal employee organisation to do so. On 3 September 1957 the union changed its name to the Merchant Service Guild of Australia. In 1976 it took over coverage of sea-going shipwrights, previously represented by the Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Association of Australia. The Australian Maritime Officers Union was formed in 1993 with the merger of the Merchant Services Guild and the Australian Stevedoring Supervisors Association.

The majority of constitutive heterochromatin is found at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, but is also found at the telomeres and throughout the chromosomes. In humans there is significantly more constitutive heterochromatin found on chromosomes 1, 9, 16, 19 and Y. Constitutive heterochromatin is composed mainly of high copy number tandem repeats known as satellite repeats, minisatellite and microsatellite repeats, and transposon repeats. In humans these regions account for about 200Mb or 6.5% of the total human genome, but their repeat composition makes them difficult to sequence, so only small regions have been sequenced. Visualization of constitutive heterochromatin is possible by using the C-banding technique. The regions that stain darker are regions of constitutive heterochromatin. The constitutive heterochromatin stains darker because of the highly condensed nature of the DNA. Constitutive heterochromatin is not to be confused with facultative heterochromatin, which is less condensed, less stable, and much less polymorphic, and which does not stain when using the C-banding technique. Possible models for expression of genes found in constitutive heterochromatin.  Function  Heterochromatin vs. euchromatin Constitutive heterochromatin is found more commonly in the periphery of the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the euchromatic DNA in the center of the nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for proper segregation of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences. Constitutive heterochromatin was thought to be relatively devoid of genes, but researchers have found more than 450 genes in the heterochromatic DNA of Drosophila melanogaster. These regions are highly condensed and epigenetically modified to prevent transcription. For the genes to be transcribed, they must have a mechanism to overcome the silencing that occurs in the rest of the heterochromatin. There are many proposed models for how the genes in these regions are expressed, including the insulation, denial, integration, exploitation, and TE restraining models. When genes are placed near a region of constitutive heterochromatin, their transcription is usually silenced. This is known as position-effect variegation and can lead to a mosaic phenotype.  Replication and epigenetics  General model for duplication of heterochromatin during cell division Constitutive heterochromatin is replicated late in S phase of the cell cycle and does not participate in meiotic recombination. Histone modifications are one of the main ways that the cell condenses constitutive heterochromatin. The three most common modifications in constitutive heterochromatin are histone hypoacetylation, histone H3-Lys9 methylation (H3K9), and cytosine methylation. These modifications are also found in other types of DNA, but much less frequently. Cytosine methylation is the most common type, although it is not found in all eukaryotes. In humans there is increased methylation at the centromeres and telomeres, which are composed of constitutive heterochromatin. These modifications can persist through both mitosis and meiosis and are heritable. SUV39H1 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K9, providing a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 is involved in the chromatin condensing process that makes DNA inaccessible for transcription.  Diseases  Genetic disorders that result from mutations involving the constitutive heterochromatin tend to affect cell differentiation and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Disorders include Roberts syndrome and ICF syndrome. Some cancers are associated with anomalies in constitutive heterochromatin and the proteins involved in its formation and maintenance. Breast cancer is linked to a decrease in the HP1 alpha protein, while non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is linked to hypomethylation of the genome and especially of satellite regions.

Geography The Taconic Mountains begin in northwest Connecticut and northeast Dutchess County, New York. They extend through western Berkshire County, Massachusetts and the adjacent counties in New York, then along the border of New York and Vermont to the town of Brandon, after which they lose prominence and dwindle into scattered hills and isolated peaks which continue north toward Burlington, Vermont. To the south, they fade into the interior Hudson Highlands range in New York.Collins, Edward Day A History of Vermont, with Geological and Geographical Notes, Bibliography (1903). University of Michigan. From the west, a wide region of foothills in New York State east of the Hudson River Valley gradually rises to the crest of the Taconic Mountains along the state's eastern border. To the east, the Taconic Mountains fall off abruptly, ending in the valleys of the Housatonic River, the upper Hoosic River, and the greater Valley of Vermont. The Berkshires and the Green Mountains rise to the east of the Taconics. Near their northern terminus they approach the eastern foothills of the Adirondack Mountains in Washington County, New York. Mount Greylock with its glacial cirque, the Hopper, is geologically part of the Taconic Mountain Range although culturally associated with the Berkshires In Massachusetts and Connecticut the geologically distinct Taconic Mountains are often incorrectly grouped as part of the Berkshires, Examples abound, for instance with regard to Mount Greylock, Summitpost.org and MountainSummits.com (Retrieved January 4, 2009) while in Vermont they are similarly mis-grouped as part of the Green Mountains. Among the highest peaks of the Taconic Mountains are Mount Equinox , located in Manchester, Vermont, the range‚Äôs high point, Mount Greylock 3,491 feet (1,064m), the highest point in Massachusetts, and Mount Frissell , the highest point in Connecticut. The Taconic Mountains lie within the New England-Acadian forests ecoregion. =Sub-ranges and regions= The South Taconic Range Because the Taconic Mountains are geologically related and contiguous with the interior Hudson Highlands well east of the Hudson River Valley, the southern boundary of the Taconics is difficult to define.

Geology and physiography The Taconic mountain range was formed from the collision of the North American Plate into a volcanic island arc, similar to modern-day Taiwan, during the late Ordovician period, around 440 million years ago. Similar subsequent events built up the parallel mountain ranges to the east. The western side of the Taconics rise gradually from a series of hills in eastern New York to a sharp mountain crest along the west border of the New England states; the east side of the Taconics falls off abruptly where river valleys divide it from the Berkshires and Green Mountains. The total length of the range is about with a varying width of .

Often, the caucus chairman is assigned other duties as well. Commonwealth Nations In Canada, the elected members of each party in Parliament, including senators, or a provincial legislature, elect among themselves a caucus chairman who presides over their meetings. This person is an important figure when the party is in opposition and an important link between cabinet and the backbench when the party is in government. United States In common U.S. Congressional Republican caucus legislative usage, the caucus chairman is styled conference chairman and is outranked by the Speaker or Senate President pro-tempore, and the leader or whip of his party. The duties of a caucus chairman depend upon the political party caucus. In the Republican conference in the U.S. House of Representatives, for instance, the caucus chairman is in charge of coordinating the party's overall message. The position of caucus chairman may or may not lead to higher office. Republican conference chair John Anderson and Democratic Caucus Chair Richard Gephardt unsuccessfully sought their party's Presidential nominations in 1980 and 1988 respectively. Anderson took his following and ran as a third party presidential candidate the same year, and never again achieved national prominence as a Republican. Gephardt though was elected as the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives in 1989, and stayed in that position through 2002, before stepping down to run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President again in 2004. Gephardt helped nominate John Kerry by promptly endorsing him after Kerry defeated him in the Iowa caucuses. Many state legislative bodies have caucus chairmen for both party caucuses in the House and in the Senate. The duties of the caucus chairman, as with the federal government, depend on the decisions of the caucus. The number of times each caucus meets, the role of each caucus in aiding legislative decision-making, the interrelationships with other caucus leaders and memberships, the assignment of political and institutional duties, all vary in accordance with local traditions and personalities. Caucuses do not always function well. In Congress in the 1950s, for instance, the House Democratic Caucus met so infrequently that insurgent Democrats formed the House Democratic Study Group, led by Rep. Eugene J. McCarthy, later a U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, to do the work of reviewing legislation now generally done by caucuses under the direction of the caucus chairmen. Caucuses have zealously guarded their prerogatives from the executive branch. When outgoing Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson became Vice-President, the President of the Senate, he suggested that his duties should include presiding over the Senate Democratic Caucus. Senate Democratic Caucus members generated enough opposition, to what they perceived as executive branch intrusion, that Johnson dropped his idea.

It was his first great success as a writer and brought him national attention. The story has also been published as \\"Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog\\" (its original title) and \\"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\". In it, the narrator retells a story he heard from a bartender, Simon Wheeler, at the Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, about the gambler Jim Smiley. The narrator describes him: \\"If he even seen a straddle bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to wherever he going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road.\\" The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches is also the title story of an 1867 collection of short stories by Mark Twain. It was Twain's first book and collected 27 stories that were previously published in magazines and newspapers. Republished by Oxford University Press (1997), . Publication history The Angels Hotel Twain first wrote the title short story at the request of his friend Artemus Ward, for inclusion in an upcoming book. Twain worked on two versions, but neither was satisfactory to him‚Äîneither got around to describing the jumping frog contest. Ward pressed him again, but by the time Twain devised a version he was willing to submit, that book was already nearing publication, so Ward sent it instead to The New York Saturday Press, where it appeared in the November 18, 1865, edition as \\"Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog\\". Twain's colorful story was immensely popular, and was soon printed in many different magazines and newspapers. Twain developed the idea further, and Bret Harte published this version in The Californian on December 16, 1865; this time titled \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\", and Smiley's name was changed to Greeley. Further popularity of the tale led Twain to use the story to anchor his own first book, which appeared in 1867 with a first issue run of only 1,000 copies. The first edition was issued in seven colors (with no priority): blue, brown, green, lavender, plum, red, and terra-cotta, and is sought after by book collectors, as it fetches thousands of dollars at auctions. In the book version, Twain changed Greeley back to Smiley. Plot summary The narrator is sent by a friend to interview an old man, Simon Wheeler, who might know the location of an old acquaintance named Leonidas W. Smiley. Finding Simon at an old mining camp, the narrator asks him if he knows anything about Leonidas; Simon appears not to, and instead tells a story about Jim Smiley, a man who had visited the camp years earlier. Jim loves to gamble and will offer to bet on anything and everything, from horse races to dogfights, to the health of the local parson's wife. He catches a frog, whom he names Dan'l Webster, and spends three months training it to jump. When a stranger visits the camp, Jim shows off Dan'l and offers to bet $40 that it can out-jump any other frog in Calaveras County. The stranger, unimpressed, says that he would take the bet if he had a frog, so Jim goes out to catch one, leaving him alone with Dan'l. While Jim is away, the stranger pours lead shot down Dan'l's throat. Once Jim returns, he and the stranger set the frogs down and let them loose. The stranger's frog jumps away while Dan'l does not budge, and the surprised and disgusted Jim pays the $40 wager. After the stranger has departed, Jim notices Dan'l's sluggishness and picks the frog up, finding it to be much heavier than he remembers. When Dan'l belches out a double handful of lead shot, Jim realizes that he has been cheated and chases after the stranger, but never catches him. At this point in the story, Simon excuses himself to go outside for a moment. The narrator realizes that Jim has no connection to Leonidas and gets up to leave, only to have Simon stop him at the door, offering to tell him about a yellow, one-eyed, stubby-tailed cow that Jim had owned. Rather than stay to hear another pointless story, the narrator excuses himself and leaves. Translations Upon discovering a French translation of this story, Twain back-translated the story into English, word for word, retaining the French grammatical structure and syntax. He then published all three versions under the title \\"The Jumping Frog: in English, then in French, and then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil\\". In \\"Private History of the ‚ÄòJumping Frog‚Äô Story\\", Twain recounts how he encountered some plagiarism of the story from an unlikely source. He was surprised to find that the frog story was apparently sourced from an ancient Greek tale. He wrote: Later, however, in November 1903, Twain noted that he had uncovered the anachronism of finding Twain's story in Sidgwick's Greek textbook: But in A. Sidgwick's \\"Note To The Thirteenth Edition\\" (1907), among \\"hearty... thanks for... help received\\", Prof. Sidgwick still failed to acknowledge his use of the Twain tale. Adaptations Lukas Foss composed The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, an opera in two scenes with libretto by Jean Karsavina, based on Twain's story. The opera premiered on May 18, 1950, at Indiana University. The story was also adapted as a scene in the film The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985), in which Mark Twain retells the story in short to Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Becky Thatcher.

Genomic evidence has conclusively shown that they are a hybrid of the common onion and the Welsh onion (A. fistulosum). However, some sources may still treat the tree onion as A. cepa var. proliferum or A. cepa Proliferum Group. Tree onion bulblets will sprout and grow while still on the original stalk. They may bend down under the weight of the new growth and take root some distance from the parent plant, giving rise to the name \\"walking onion.\\" It has been postulated that the name \\"Egyptian onion\\" derived from Romani people bringing tree onions to Europe from the Indian subcontinent. The tree onion is a species of perennial onion. It is a diploid hybrid between the bunching onion and the shallot. Also known as turfed stone leek, it may be cultivated commercially and for foliage. It is described as a shallot which can be grown in tropical conditions. The phenomenon of forming bulblets instead of flowers is also seen in garlic and other alliums, which sometimes may also be referred to as top onions or tree onions. The bulblets are usually marble-sized, between 0.5 cm to 3 cm in diameter. Many tree onions are very strong flavoured, although some cultivars are relatively mild and sweet. The underground bulbs are particularly tough- skinned and pungent, and can be quite elongate, like leeks, or in some types may form bulbs up to 5 cm across. Young plants may be used as scallions in the spring, and the bulblets may be used in cooking similarly to regular onions, or preserved by pickling.

Jamieson was born in St. John's, Newfoundland. His father was a newspaper editor, and his grandfather was a fisherman who settled in Newfoundland from Scotland.  Early life and Confederation  He worked for Newfoundland's Department of Rural Reconstruction, as a bookkeeper, and as a sales manager for Coca-Cola before starting a career in broadcasting. He was Newfoundland's best known radio and television personality. In 1945, he became the first Newfoundlander to sit in the press gallery of the Parliament of Canada, reporting on the negotiations that led to Canada inviting Newfoundland to join Canadian Confederation. During the two referendums on the question in 1948, Jamieson vehemently campaigned in opposition to Newfoundland joining Canada, favouring an economic union with the United States instead. The Party for Economic Union with the United States was led by Chesley Crosbie and Jamieson became known as \\"my father's voice\\" according to John Crosbie.  Broadcasting  In 1951, he obtained a licence, in partnership with Geoff Stirling, for a new radio station in St. John's. He eventually established a private radio network in Newfoundland, and the island's first television station CJON-TV. While Stirling was heavily interested in the business aspect, Jamieson became known to Newfoundlanders as the host of the nightly News Cavalcade. The program featured a main news segment, weather and an extended interview that included guests from Howie Meeker to Joey Smallwood. He became president of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in 1961, and remained in that position for four years. During his time as president Jamieson traveled the country extensively and also recorded daily 'minute-torials' that were 60 second long commentary broadcasts recorded at CJON which were nationally distributed via the CAB and subsequently syndicated across Canada. Jamieson was also involved in the transition of the Board of Broadcast Governors changing over to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.  Political life  Jamieson entered politics by successfully contesting a 1966 by-election as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. He was re-elected in the 1968 election, and joined the Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Defence Production. In 1969, he became Minister of Transport retaining that portfolio until 1972 when he became Minister of Regional Economic Expansion. In 1976, he became Secretary of State for External Affairs. He was re-elected in the 1979 election that brought down the Liberal government. Jamieson then moved to provincial politics, winning the leadership of the Newfoundland Liberal Party one month before the June 1979 provincial election. Jamieson's Liberals were defeated, and he resigned as provincial party leader in 1980. In 1983, he was appointed Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and served until 1985. \\"His fund of political anecdotes and Newfoundland stories made him a firm favourite with the Queen,\\" - published in The Daily Telegraph in 1986. He returned to Newfoundland to run his broadcasting interests before dying of a heart attack in 1986.  Just Himself: the Don Jamieson Story  His grandson, Joshua Jamieson, produced, directed and wrote a documentary titled \\"Just Himself: the story of Don Jamieson\\",Just Himself: the story of Don Jamieson which was developed over a three-year period and produced by Odd Sock Films Inc. in association with m0xY Productions. The documentary features interviews with Paul Martin, Joe Clark, William Rompkey, Mike Duffy, Richard Cashin, John Crosbie, Edward Roberts, Mary Hodder, Don Hollett, Scott Andrews, Scott Simms, Chris Dunn, Bill Callahan, Jim Furlong and Gerry Phelan. The film also includes insights from Jamieson's children: Heather Jamieson, Donna Jamieson Sittmann, Roger Jamieson and Debby Jamieson Winters as well as his brother's Bas Jamieson (longtime host of the Open Line program heard on VOCM) and Colin Jamieson. The film was shot in six locations that included St John's, Swift Current, Marystown, Burin, Ottawa and Montreal. It is narrated by Brian Tobin and set to air on NTV (CJON-DT) in the fall of 2011.

When the imaging system obeys the Abbe sine condition, the ratio of the sines of these angles equal the (lateral absolute) magnification of the system. The Abbe sine condition is a condition that must be fulfilled by a lens or other optical system in order for it to produce sharp images of off-axis as well as on-axis objects. It was formulated by Ernst Abbe in the context of microscopes. The Abbe sine condition says that > the sine of the object-space angle \\\\alpha_o should be proportional to the > sine of the image space angle \\\\alpha_i Furthermore, the ratio equals the magnification of the system. In mathematical terms this is: :\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\alpha_o}{\\\\sin \\\\alpha_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\beta_o}{\\\\sin \\\\beta_i} = M where the variables (\\\\alpha_o, \\\\beta_o) are the angles (relative to the optic axis) of any two rays as they leave the object, and (\\\\alpha_i, \\\\beta_i) are the angles of the same rays where they reach the image plane (say, the film plane of a camera). For example, (\\\\alpha_o, \\\\alpha_i) might represent a paraxial ray (i.e., a ray nearly parallel with the optic axis), and (\\\\beta_o, \\\\beta_i) might represent a marginal ray (i.e., a ray with the largest angle admitted by the system aperture). An optical imaging system for which this is true in for all rays is said to obey the Abbe sine condition. Magnification and the Abbe sine condition An optical imaging system (gray box) that obeys the sine condition has a fixed ratio between the sines of the ray angles at the entrance and exit of the system \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\alpha_o}{\\\\sin \\\\alpha_i} = M. This ratio equals the magnification (M). Using the framework of Fourier optics, we may easily explain the significance of the Abbe sine condition. Say an object in the object plane of an optical system has a transmittance function of the form, T(xo,yo). We may express this transmittance function in terms of its Fourier transform as :T(x_o,y_o) = \\\\iint T(k_x,k_y) ~ e^{j(k_x x_o + k_y y_o)} ~ dk_x \\\\, dk_y. Now, assume for simplicity that the system has no image distortion, so that the image plane coordinates are linearly related to the object plane coordinates via the relation : x_i = M x_o \\\\, : y_i = M y_o \\\\, where M is the system magnification. The object plane transmittance above can now be re-written in a slightly modified form: :T(x_o,y_o) = \\\\iint T(k_x,k_y) ~ e^{j((k_x/M) (Mx_o) + (k_y/M) (My_o))} ~ dk_x \\\\, dk_y where the various terms have been simply multiplied and divided in the exponent by M, the system magnification. Now, the equations may be substituted above for image plane coordinates in terms of object plane coordinates, to obtain, :T(x_i,y_i) = \\\\iint T(k_x,k_y) ~ e^{j((k_x/M) x_i + (k_y/M) y_i)} ~ dk_x \\\\, dk_y At this point another coordinate transformation can be proposed (i.e., the Abbe sine condition) relating the object plane wavenumber spectrum to the image plane wavenumber spectrum as :k^i_x = \\\\frac{k_x}{M} :k^i_y = \\\\frac{k_y}{M} to obtain the final equation for the image plane field in terms of image plane coordinates and image plane wavenumbers as: :T(x_i,y_i) = M^2 \\\\iint T(M k^i_x,M k^i_y) ~ e^{j(k^i_x x_i + k^i_y y_i)} dk^i_x \\\\, dk^i_y From Fourier optics, it is known that the wavenumbers can be expressed in terms of the spherical coordinate system as : k_x = k \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\, : k_y = k \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\, If a spectral component is considered for which \\\\varphi =0, then the coordinate transformation between object and image plane wavenumbers takes the form : k^i \\\\sin \\\\theta^i = k \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{M}. This is another way of writing the Abbe sine condition, which simply reflects the classical uncertainty principle for Fourier transform pairs, namely that as the spatial extent of any function is expanded (by the magnification factor, M), the spectral extent contracts by the same factor, M, so that the space-bandwidth product remains constant.

The AMWU represents a broad range of workers in the manufacturing sector, as well as associated industries, and is affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The union is organised into six state branches, as well as four divisions, representing different industries or occupational groups: the Manufacturing Division, the Food and Confectionery Division, the Vehicle Division and the Printing Division. History Prime Minister John Howard's IR reforms The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (AMWU) was formed in 1972 with the amalgamation of three metal trade unions - the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia (BBS), the Sheet Metal Working Industrial Union of Australia (SMWU) and the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). In 1937, BBS was the Boilermakers' Society of Australia, and following the merger with the Blacksmiths' Society of Australia in 1965, the union was renamed the Boilermakers' and Blacksmiths' Society of Australia.Trade Union entry - Boilermakers Society of Australia (1937 - 1965) At its formation the AMWU had a membership of 171,000, making it the largest organisation in Australia by membership. In 1979, the Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Union of Australia amalgamated with the AMWU, which changed its name to the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union (AMWSU). When the Federated Moulders‚Äô (Metals) Union amalgamated in 1983, the union's name changed slightly to the Amalgamated Metals Foundry & Shipwrights‚Äô Union, but in 1985 reverted to be the Amalgamated Metal Workers‚Äô Union. By 1987 the union's membership had declined slightly to 163,400. During the 1980s the AMWU played a pivotal role in securing the support of the left wing of the Australian union movement for the Prices and Incomes Accord, which involved unions agreeing to restrict their demands for wage increases in exchange for the federal government implementing policies to advance the 'social wage', including universal health insurance, investment in education and social welfare. In 1991 the AMWU amalgamated with the Association of Draughting Supervisory & Technical Employees (ADSTE) created the Metals and Engineering Workers‚Äô Union. Two years later a further amalgamation with the Vehicle Builders Employees‚Äô Federation of Australia resulted in the Automotive Metals & Engineering Union. In 1994 the union merged with the Confectionery Workers' and Food Preservers‚Äô Union, itself a recent amalgamation of the Food Preservers' Union of Australia and the Confectionery Workers' Union of Australia, to form the Automotive Food Metals and Engineering Union. Finally, the Printing and Kindred Industries Union amalgamated to form the printing division of the Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union. During the 1990s and 2000s membership of the AMWU declined dramatically, reflecting the rapid decline of the manufacturing sector in Australia, falling from 200,000 in 1995 to 157,000 in 2005. Losses then accelerated, membership more than halving over the following decade to 68,008 in 2017.

Palazzo Salviati shop of the Salviati family in Venice  Biography  A native of Vicenza, Salviati was a lawyer who became interested in glass work after participating in restorations being done on the mosaics of Saint Mark's Cathedral in Venice. He opened his first glass business in 1859 with Lorenzo Radi, and this firm produced the mosaic glass for the altar screen for the high altar of Westminster Abbey. In 1876, he left this business to establish a new firm which executed the mosaic decoration of the dome of Aachen Cathedral. The designs of this cathedral were based on the ideas of the Belgian architect Jean-Baptiste de Bethune. The Victorian period saw Salviati turn glass pieces, a former staple of wealth only enjoyed by a few, into ornamental pieces seen by millions throughout the homes and parlors of Italy. During 1866, Antonio Salviati founded Compagnia Venezia Murano with British diplomat and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard. Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano has continued to be an important producer of Venetian art glass. Of particular historical relevance is the mosaic portrait of President Abraham Lincoln, which can be viewed today in the Senate House rooms in the United States, produced by Compagnia Venezia Murano and donated by Antonio Salviati in 1866. Murano had been a centre of fine glasswork since the Middle Ages (producing the glass that bore its name), but the pieces were lavish and expensive specialty pieces that only the wealthy could afford. Salviati changed the face of the business by becoming the first glass factory owner to employ a large number of skilled workers to mass-produce glass intended for export. The Victorian period saw Salviati turn glass pieces, a former staple of wealth enjoyed by a few, into ornamental pieces seen by millions throughout the homes and parlors of Italy. This re-established Murano as a centre for glass manufacture. Salviati died on 25 January 1890 in Venice, Italy.  Works in Europe  Salviati's work spread mainly to England and France, where his work was best associated with the architectural design style of these countries. His mosaics can be seen in many churches across these countries. His smaller, mass produced work, stayed relative to Italy being sold as retail.

It is the 13th book in the Redwall series to be published. It is the earliest chronological installment in the series. Synopsis The book focuses on a badger, Lord Brocktree, and haremaid Dotti as they journey towards Salamandastron, the mountain fortress of badger lords, to recapture it from the wildcat Ungatt Trunn. Plot summary US cover of Lord Brocktree This book revolves around the badger Lord Brocktree, father of Boar the Fighter, grandfather of Bella of Brockhall, and great-grandfather of Sunflash the Mace. He sets out to find the ancient badger mountain stronghold of Salamandastron, aided by the quick talking haremaid Dorothea Duckfontein Dillworthy and otter Ruffgar Brookback. Meanwhile, in Salamandastron, trouble comes for Brocktree's father, Lord Stonepaw. Years of peace have left the mountain stronghold with few fighters, and those that remain are long past their prime, including Stonepaw himself. The wildcat Ungatt Trunn, son of Mortspear, Highland King of the North, lays siege to the fortress with his Blue Hordes. Eventually the mountain is overrun, leading to the deaths of many hares and even of Stonepaw himself, who dies valiantly defending his hares, taking many vermin with him as he does. The wildcat takes at least sixty hares as prisoners, but through the efforts of warrior Stiffener Medick and his otter friend Brogalaw, they escape. Lord Brocktree gets an army from the hare Bucko Bigbones, after Dotti defeats him in a contest. Thanks to the Bark Crew, the group of guerrillas formed by Stiffener and Brogalaw to harass Trunn, the Blue Hordes are slowly starved, their supplies cut off. Ungatt Trunn tricks the Bark Crew into putting up a last stand in battle, but Lord Brocktree joins forces with the hares and saves the day. The book culminates in a massive final battle, with many memorable characters killed, including Jukka and Fleetscut. Eventually, when the battle ends up a near-stalemate, Trunn and Brocktree face off in a duel. After a failed assassination attempt on Brocktree by the searats Ripfang and Doomeye and the corsair fleet captain Karangool (Trunn's second in command) the badger eventually wins, snapping Trunn's spine and leaving him on the sand to die. Trunn is thrown into the water but survives, only to be drowned by Groddil, one of his former advisors. The book ends with thousands of hares rallying to form the Long Patrol under Brocktree and Dotti (whom the badger names first Long Patrol General).

Georgia, Proffitt v. Florida, Jurek v. Texas, Woodson v. North Carolina, and Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), reaffirmed the United States Supreme Court's acceptance of the use of the death penalty in the United States, upholding, in particular, the death sentence imposed on Troy Leon Gregg. Referred to by a leading scholar as the July 2 CasesSee and elsewhere referred to by the lead case Gregg, the Supreme Court set forth the two main features that capital sentencing procedures must employ in order to comply with the Eighth Amendment ban on \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\". The decision essentially ended the de facto moratorium on the death penalty imposed by the Court in its 1972 decision in Furman v. Georgia . Background All five cases share the same basic procedural history. After the Furman decision, the states of Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana amended their death penalty statutes to meet the Furman guidelines. Subsequently, the five named defendantsThis article provides information on the crime in Gregg. were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in their respective states. The respective state supreme courtsAt the time Texas had (and still has) separate courts with final power of review over civil and criminal cases; the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was (and remains) the court with final review power over criminal cases. upheld the death sentence. The defendants then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their death sentence, asking the Court to go beyond Furman and declare once and for all the death penalty to be \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" and thus in violation of the Constitution; the Court agreed to hear the cases. In the July 2 Cases, the Court's goal was to provide guidance to states in the wake of Furman. In Furman only one basic idea could command a majority vote of the Justices: capital punishment, as then practiced in the United States, was cruel and unusual punishment because there were no rational standards that determined when it was imposed and when it was not. The question the Court resolved in these cases was not whether the death sentence imposed on each of the individual defendants was cruel, but rather whether the process by which those sentences were imposed was rational and objectively reviewable. =Capital punishment and the Eighth Amendment= The defendants in each of the five cases urged the Court to go further than it had in Furman by holding once and for all that capital punishment was cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment. However the Court responded that \\"The most marked indication of society's endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to Furman.\\" Both Congress and 35 states had complied with the Court's dictates in Furman by either specifying factors to be weighed and procedures to be followed when imposing a death sentence, or dictating that the death penalty would be mandatory for specific crimes. Furthermore, a referendum in California had overturned the California Supreme Court's earlier decision (California v. Anderson) holding that the death penalty violated the California constitution. The fact that juries remained willing to impose the death penalty also contributed to the Court's conclusion that American society did not believe in 1976 that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The Court also found that the death penalty \\"comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the [Eighth] Amendment\\". The death penalty serves two principal social purposes‚Äîretribution and deterrence. \\"In part, capital punishment is an expression of society's moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct\\". But this outrage must be expressed in an ordered fashion, for America is a society of laws. Retribution is consistent with human dignity, because society believes that \\"certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death\\". And although it is difficult to determine statistically how much crime the death penalty actually deters, the Court found that in 1976 there was \\"no convincing empirical evidence\\" supporting either the view that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime or the opposite view. Still, the Court could not completely discount the possibility that for certain \\"carefully contemplated murderers\\", \\"the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act\\". Finally, the Court considered whether the death penalty is \\"disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed\\". Although death is severe and irrevocable, the Court could not say that death was always disproportionate to the crime of deliberately taking human life. \\"It is an extreme sanction, suitable to the most extreme of crimes.\\" =Historical disapproval of mandatory death sentences= The Court was determined to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be cruel and unusual, it must still be carried out in a manner consistent with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England. In 18th century Britain, the penalty for a vast number of serious crimes, including murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options‚Äîconvicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright‚Äîit has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free. To mitigate the harshness of the common-law rule, Pennsylvania divided murder into \\"degrees\\" in 1794. First-degree murder, a capital crime, was limited to all \\"willful, deliberate, and premeditated\\" murders. All other murder was second-degree murder, and not a capital crime. This development eased the tension created by the common-law mandatory death penalty, but some juries still refused to convict defendants who were clearly guilty of first-degree murder because that crime carried a mandatory death penalty. Recognizing that juries in capital cases found discretion in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury could respond to mitigating factors about the crime or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900 23 states and the federal government had discretionary sentencing in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and by 1963 all death- penalty jurisdictions employed discretionary sentencing. Decision of the Court The Court set out two broad guidelines that legislatures must follow in order to craft a constitutional capital sentencing scheme: *First, the scheme must provide objective criteria to direct and limit the death sentencing discretion. The objectiveness of these criteria must in turn be ensured by appellate review of all death sentences. *Second, the scheme must allow the sentencer (whether judge or jury) to take into account the character and record of an individual defendant. In Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek, the Court found that the capital sentencing schemes of Georgia, Florida, and Texas, respectively, met these criteria; whereas in Woodson and Roberts, the Court found that the sentencing schemes of North Carolina and Louisiana did not. =Constitutional sentencing procedures= The proposition that the death penalty was not always cruel and unusual punishment was just the beginning of the discussion. Furman had held that \\"where discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be taken or spared, that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\\" The question the Court confronted in these five cases was whether the procedures crafted by Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana adequately minimized that risk. In all five cases, the Court's primary focus was on the jury. Although in most criminal cases the judge decides and imposes the sentence, \\"jury sentencing has been considered desirable in capital cases in order to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system‚Äîa link without which the determination of punishment could hardly reflect the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\" The drafters of the Model Penal Code concluded that the now-familiar bifurcated procedure, in which the jury first considers the question of guilt without regard to punishment, and then determines whether the punishment should be death or life imprisonment, is the preferable model. This was the model that the Court approved in these cases‚Äîalthough it tacitly approved a model without any jury involvement in the sentencing process, an approval that persisted until 2002's Ring v. Arizona. The drawback of having juries rather than judges fix the penalty in capital cases is the risk that they will have no frame of reference for imposing the death penalty in a rational manner. Although this problem may not be totally correctible, the Court trusted that the guidance given the jury by the aggravating factors or other special- verdict questions would assist it in deciding on a sentence. The drafters of the Model Penal Code \\"concluded that it is within the realm of possibility to point to the main circumstances of aggravation and mitigation that should be weighed and weighed against each other when they are presented in a concrete case.\\" For the Court, these factors adequately guarded against the risk of arbitrary imposition of the death sentence. Every death sentence involves first an eligibility determination and then a selection of an eligible defendant for the death penalty. A defendant is eligible for the death penalty once the jury has concluded that he is a member of that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible defendant is then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is worthy of a death sentence. In addition to jury sentencing through the guidance of aggravating factors, a constitutional capital sentencing scheme must provide for appellate review of the death sentence, typically by the state's supreme court. This review must not be a rubber stamp; there must be evidence in the state's decisional law that the court takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that the sentence imposed was not arbitrary. Currently, those states which still maintain a death penalty option have a mandatory appeal of the sentence (defendants sentenced to death cannot waive this appeal, but can waive appeals beyond this stage subject to a competency hearing). With Gregg and the companion cases, the Court approved three different schemes that had sufficiently narrow eligibility criteria and at the same time sufficiently broad discretion in selection. By contrast, the two schemes the Court disapproved had overly broad eligibility criteria and then no discretion in sentencing. Capital punishment schemes approved by the Court =Georgia= Under the Georgia scheme (which generally followed the Model Penal Code), after the defendant was convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a capital crime (under the first part of the bifurcated trial proceeding),After Georgia revised its death penalty law in response to Furman, there were six capital crimes in Georgia: murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, rape, treason, and aircraft hijacking. The Supreme Court's later decision in Coker v. Georgia, , invalidated Georgia's death penalty for rape (and probably also for robbery, at least where death does not result). the second part of the bifurcated trial involved an additional hearing at which the jury received additional evidence in aggravation and mitigation. In order for the defendant to be eligible for the death penalty, the jury needed to find the existence of one of ten aggravating factors: # The defendant has previously been convicted of a capital felony or has a history of committing serious felonies. # The capital felony was committed while the defendant was committing another capital felony. # The defendant created a grave risk of death to others. # The defendant committed the crime for the purpose of receiving money or anything else of value. # The defendant killed a judge or prosecutor exercising his official duties. # The defendant hired a killer. # The crime was \\"outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.\\"The vagueness of this language was at issue in the later case of Godfrey v. Georgia, . # The defendant killed a police officer, prison guard, or fireman in the line of duty. # The offense was committed by someone who had escaped from prison. # The offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding arrest. Once the jury found that one or more of the aggravating factors existed beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant would be eligible for the death penalty. The jury may, but was not required to, then evaluate all the evidence it had heard, including mitigating evidence and other aggravating evidence not supporting one of the ten factors beyond a reasonable doubt‚Äîand decide whether the defendant should live or die. This scheme is called a non-weighing scheme, because the sentencer is not required to weigh the statutory aggravating factors against mitigating evidence before imposing a death sentence.See Zant v. Stephens, . The Court found that, because of the jury's finding at least one aggravating factor was a prerequisite for imposing the death penalty, Georgia's scheme adequately narrowed the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. Although there was admittedly some discretion as to the mitigation phase, that discretion is channeled in an objective way, and therefore provided for individualized sentencing. Thus, Georgia's death penalty scheme complied with the Furman requirements and was thus approved by the Court. =Florida= Florida's scheme differed from Georgia's in two respects. First, at the sentencing hearing of a capital felon,The crimes punished by death in Florida are first-degree murder and sexual battery of a child under eleven. the jury determined whether one or more aggravating factors exist, drawing on a list very similar to Georgia's. Then the jury was specifically asked to weigh the mitigating evidence presented against the statutory aggravating factors that have been proved. This scheme is called a weighing scheme. Second, the jury's role was only advisory; the judge could disregard the jury's sentencing recommendation, but had to explain his reasoning if he did. Under Florida law, if the jury recommended life but the judge imposed a death sentence, \\"the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\\" The trial judge must independently reweigh the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors. The Court concluded that, as the sentencer's discretion was limited in an objective fashion and directed in a reviewable manner, Florida's scheme also adequately narrowed the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. The Court noted that Florida's scheme came closest to the Model Penal Code's recommendation of an ideal sentencing scheme, as it used a weighing scheme whereas Georgia's scheme did not, thus allowing for individual sentencing. Thus, Florida's death penalty scheme also complied with the Furman requirements and was thus also approved by the Court. =Texas= Texas's scheme differed considerably from that suggested by the Model Penal Code and followed in large part by Georgia and Florida. In order to narrow the class of death penalty-eligible defendants as required by Furman, the Texas Legislature did not adopt the \\"aggravating factors\\" approach outlined by the Model Penal Code. Instead, it chose to modify and severely narrow the legal definition of \\"capital murder\\", thus requiring certain objective elements to be present before one could be charged with capital murder and thus eligible for the death penalty. The 1976 law defined capital murder in Texas as involving one of the five situations: *murder of a police officer or fireman; *murder committed in the course of committing kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape, or arson; *murder committed for remuneration (contract killing); *murder committed while escaping or attempting to escape from a penal institution; and *murder committed by a prison inmate when the victim is a prison employee. If the defendant was convicted of capital murder, and if the prosecution sought the death penalty (which it has never been required to do in Texas), the second part of the bifurcated trial required the jury to consider two (or sometimes three) \\"special issues\\": *whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result; *whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society (under Texas law, \\"society\\" was defined as both inside and outside of the prison system; thus, a defendant who would pose a threat to persons inside prison ‚Äì such as other inmates or correctional officers ‚Äì would be eligible for the death penalty); and *if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased. If all applicable special issues were answered in the affirmative, then the result would be an automatic death sentence; if any special issue was not answered in the affirmative, the sentence would be life imprisonment. The Court concluded that Texas's narrow legal definition of capital murder served the same purpose as the aggravating factors in the Georgia and Florida schemes, that being to adequately narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. The Court even observed that \\"the principal difference between Texas and the other two States [Georgia and Florida] is that the death penalty is an available sentencing option - even potentially - for a smaller class of murders in Texas\\". (a somewhat ironic observation in retrospect, given that Texas is the most active in sentencing capital murder defendants to the death penalty). However, the special issues feature and its automatic death sentence imposition (if all were answered in the affirmative) was the key issue in the Court's analysis. In its review, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (which serves as the body for automatic appeal of death sentences in Texas) indicated that the second special issue (the \\"continuing threat to society\\" issue) would allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the jury.The Court has subsequently considered at great length the extent to which the Texas special issues allow the jury to consider that evidence. See Penry v. Lynaugh, ; Penry v. Johnson, ; Tennard v. Dretke, . The Court concluded that the second special issue would allow for the same extensive consideration of mitigating evidence as the Georgia and Florida schemes. Thus, Texas's death penalty scheme, though considerably different from Florida's and Georgia's also complied with the Furman requirements and was thus also approved by the Court. The defendant in this case, Jerry Jurek (TDCJ #508), would ultimately see his sentence commuted to life in prison. Texas would later amend its three questions, keeping the \\"continuing threat to society\\" question, adding a second question specifically dealing with mitigating evidence, and adding a third question applicable only if the defendant was convicted as an accessory. Capital punishment schemes rejected by the Court =North Carolina= In 1974, the North Carolina General Assembly (similar to the approach taken by the Texas Legislature) chose to adopt a narrow definition of \\"first-degree murder\\" which would be eligible for the death penalty, which was defined as: :murder perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony. North Carolina had also enacted a mandatory death penalty for first-degree rape, but the Court later ruled in Coker v. Georgia that rape is not a capital crime, at least where the victim is not killed; the statutes mandating death penalty for first-degree arson and first-degree burglary were abrogated by the General Assembly. The North Carolina Supreme Court had ruled that its capital sentencing scheme could survive Furman analysis if the legislature removed the discretionary sentencing provision. However, it was the lack of discretion in sentencing that the Court used to rule the scheme unconstitutional. =Louisiana= In 1973, the Louisiana Legislature adopted the approach taken by North Carolina, by redefining first-degree murder as the killing of a human being in one of five circumstances: # when the offender has a specific intent to kill and is engaged in the perpetration of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, or armed robbery; # when the offender has a specific intent to kill a fireman or police officer engaged in the performance of his duties; # when the offender has a specific intent to kill and has previously been convicted of an unrelated murder or is serving a life sentence; # when the offender has a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm on more than one person; and # when the offender has a specific intent to kill and has been offered or has received anything of value for committing the murder Also, unlike North Carolina, Louisiana law required the jury in all first-degree murder cases to be instructed on second-degree murder and manslaughter, crimes ineligible for the death penalty. Although Louisiana had created a class of death-eligible crimes somewhat narrower than North Carolina had, it still had a mandatory death penalty for a significant range of crimes, which were aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping and treason; the lack of discretion in sentencing caused the Louisiana scheme to suffer the same unconstitutional infirmities as North Carolina's. Other views expressed in these cases Justices Brennan and Marshall expressed their views, which they also articulated in Furman, that the death penalty does not deter crime and that American society has evolved to the point that it is no longer an appropriate vehicle for expressing retribution. In every subsequent capital case that would come before the Court during their tenures, they would refer to their opinions in Gregg in support of their vote against the death penalty. Justice White countered that capital punishment cannot be unconstitutional because the Constitution expressly mentions it and because two centuries of Court decisions assumed that it was constitutional. Furthermore, for White the judgment of the legislatures of 35 states was paramount, and suggested that the punishment should remain in use. He also felt that the Court should defer to a state legislature's response to the problem of juror response to the prospect of capital punishment, rather than dictate that the Eighth Amendment requires a particular response. White also disagreed that the Constitution required a separate penalty hearing before imposing the death penalty. \\"Even if the character of the accused must be considered under the Eighth Amendment, surely a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that the criminal's character is such that he deserves death.\\" He also saw no difference between Louisiana's definition of first-degree murder and Texas's definition of capital murder. Justice Rehnquist would have upheld North Carolina's and Louisiana's mandatory death penalties. He disputed the historical evidence adduced in support of the claim that American juries dislike mandatory death penalties. He also felt that the Court's decisions had an analytical flaw. The Court had struck down the mandatory death penalty because it took away discretion from the jury. Yet, Rehnquist pointed out, a jury in Georgia could reject the death penalty for no reason at all. Thus, Georgia's scheme did not alleviate the concerns articulated in Furman about the arbitrariness of the death penalty any more than North Carolina's ignored them. He also disputed whether the appellate review of death sentences inherent in the systems the Court had approved could truly ensure that each death sentence satisfied those concerns. He finally took issue with the idea that the fact that \\"death is different\\" requires any extra safeguards in the sentencing process. Justice John Paul Stevens remarked in October 2010 that his vote in the decision was regrettable. Stevens wrote that his vote was made with respect for precedent within the court that held capital punishment to be constitutional. Aftermath Utah was the first state to resume executions after capital punishment was reinstated in the United States in 1976, when Gary Gilmore was executed by a firing squad on January 17, 1977.Death Penalty Information Center Following his conviction and death sentence Gilmore insisted he wanted to be executed, and for this reason some consider the national moratorium to have only ended in 1979 with electrocution of John Arthur Spenkelink, who resisted his execution. The July 2 Cases mark the beginning of the United States' modern legal conversation about the death penalty. Major subsequent developments include forbidding the death penalty for rape (Coker v. Georgia), restricting the death penalty in cases of felony murder (Enmund v. Florida), exempting the mentally handicapped (Atkins v. Virginia) and juvenile murderers (Roper v. Simmons) from the death penalty, removing virtually all limitations on the presentation of mitigating evidence (Lockett v. Ohio, Holmes v. South Carolina), requiring precision in the definition of aggravating factors (Godfrey v. Georgia, Walton v. Arizona), and requiring the jury to decide whether aggravating factors have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt (Ring v. Arizona).

It is a story of an assassin who struggles with her identity in near-future Japan. The 2009 miniseries, Kabuki: The Alchemy, was published by Marvel Comics under its imprint Icon Comics. The series has been collected into several trade paperbacks, which include several one-shots and spin-off limited series. Plot Set in an alternate near-future Japan, a young woman codenamed \\"Kabuki\\", acts as an agent and television law-enforcement personality for a clandestine government body known as \\"The Noh\\". In the first volume of the series, The Noh's nature and background is explained. The Noh is controlled by a renowned World War II Japanese military man known as the General, who has achieved much power and status for being a brilliant military tactician during his many years of service. The agency itself exists as part of Japan's strict police state, which hunts down and brutally executes criminals for their misdeeds under the veil of keeping the peace. Secretly the Noh also acts to maintain the balance of crime and order that ultimately benefits the national economy on both sides of the law and thus targets politicians, businessmen and certain underworld kingpins whose actions threaten this balance. Kabuki herself is one of eight masked assassins who perform these secret executions under the General's orders. Ryuchi Kai is the General's son and another war veteran, who is a Yakuza boss and every bit as deadly and brilliant as his father but has earned a reputation for swift brutality. Astonishingly, despite the high level of discretion surrounding Noh, Kai manages to infiltrate the agency, personally, by using its policy of masked operatives to his advantage. He poses as Oni ‚Äì one of the General's two overseers of the assassins (the other being a mysterious old man named \\"Dove\\"). He manipulates Kabuki and her partners into eliminating the entire underworld hierarchy in Tokyo. Publicly Kai is a talented businessman with much stock and influence in the Japanese market, thus this move makes him indispensable and essential to the balance. Kabuki's origins are revealed as the story progresses, her mother was an Ainu comfort woman named \\"Tsukiko\\" taken by Japanese soldiers during WWII. Rather than be used as sex slaves, the General instead had the women act out Kabuki plays to entertain the soldiers, something that was met with scorn by his son, who fast made \\"Kabuki\\" a derogatory term among the ranks. Tsukiko in particular captivated the General, a widower, who took her to be his wife. This decision infuriated Kai, who saw it as an affront to his deceased mother. On the eve of their wedding, he assaulted, raped, blinded and savagely scarred Tsukiko with the words \\"Kabuki\\" into her back. Tsukiko survived the encounter, and she was pregnant with Kai's child, something the General kept hidden. Tsukiko dies while her daughter Ukiko is being born. The General in turn raises her as his own daughter. Nine years later, Kai, still demented and vicious, learns of the child's existence and savagely attacks Ukiko at her mother's grave, once again carving \\"Kabuki\\" into her skin, this time along the girl's face. Ukiko dies for nine minutes but is successfully resuscitated. From then on, the General grooms her into a perfect soldier, having her trained in martial arts, combat and weaponry so that she may never fall victim to another assault. When the Noh is created, she is given a mask reminiscent of her mother's face and the codename \\"Kabuki\\" ‚Äì claiming the term as her own. In the present, Kai is a political figurehead and inaccessible from The Noh's wrath, going as far to reconnect with his father to cement his status. Most Noh agents are all dismissed by Dove except Kabuki. Dove reveals that he is in fact her biological grandfather on her mother's side, that The Noh has become defunct, and that Kai's reign has gone on long enough. He dispatches Kabuki/Ukiko to eliminate him, his followers, and The Noh's board of directors. The battle is bloody, and Kai very nearly defeats her, though she succeeds at the last moment. Her final confrontation at the General's headquarters results in her sustaining fatal wounds. Victorious and dying, Ukiko finally limps to her mother's grave to die. With the following volumes, it is revealed that Ukiko was in fact abducted shortly after this, by a rival agency called \\"Control Corps\\", who treat her injuries and keep her trapped and medicated within a hidden asylum for broken-down government agents. For nine months, they study her and probe her for information regarding The Noh. She does not relent and instead, devotes this period to introspection and personal reflection. During this time she is contacted periodically by another inmate ‚Äì a mysterious individual known as Akemi who has grand plans for escape. Meanwhile, outside of the asylum, all of Japan is in confusion as its top political lynchpins have been killed, and The Noh is unable to comment. Dove has vanished and, with him, all knowledge of Ukiko's motives. Thus, the seven remaining assassins have been dispatched to hunt down Ukiko and kill her. Ironically during the months of searching, two of the agents, codenamed \\"Scarab\\" and \\"Tigerlilly\\", become friends and start socializing as civilians ‚Äì something which later compromises their mission. Through Akemi's elaborate machinations, Ukiko manages to escape Control Corps just as her former partners arrive to eliminate her, resulting in the death of one of them. Akemi takes advantage of this and just as Kai did, he poses as the fallen agent to continue infiltrating The Noh, this time on Ukiko's behalf. Ukiko then embarks on a convoluted trail, given to her by Akemi, so she can forge a new identity and life for herself. Escaping Japan to America, with the help of other brilliant escapees under Akemi's employ, she successfully achieves a blissful, private existence wherein she can be happy. The final pages of the series see her subtly overthrowing The Noh altogether, through a tell-all comic book created by herself and a comic artist whom she encounters. She also falls pregnant, much to her delight. Style Unlike most comic series, the plot of Kabuki moves very little over the course of the volumes. Very little fast- paced or violent action takes place. Instead, most of the focus is on memories, dreams, thoughts and philosophy. David Mack's characters, especially Kabuki herself, revisit the same scenes and memories many times, rethinking them and their significance. Mack uses myriad art styles, not only pencil, ink, and color, but paint, magazine clippings, manga scans, and crayons. In Kabuki: The Alchemy especially, many of the pages are photos (or color scans) of collages using a variety of materials; for example, the fingers of Japanese sandalwood fans become the borders of the comic panels. Imagery is very important and prominent in the series; Mack reuses the same images, often changing them slightly, and focusing on the emotional content of images and the power of memories. In Kabuki: Masks of the Noh, a different artist was assigned to each agent as a way of visually representing their personalities. This continued in Kabuki: Scarab, which was written by Mack with art by Rick Mays, who had previously drawn Scarab in Masks of the Noh.  Characters  =The Noh Assassins= * Kabuki/Ukiko - The protagonist of the series, Ukiko is a beautiful but tragic young woman struggling with her sense of self, following years of social withdrawal, mental conditioning and a severe assault during childhood that horribly disfigured her face. Ukiko acts as the top enforcement agent of The Noh, executing potentially dangerous individuals before they become national-level threats. She is also the voice of the airwaves and a national icon, updating the people of Japan with daily news and weather reports. When her biological father, Ryuchi Kai, begins to compromise the Noh, Ukiko sets out to eliminate him. She starts a difficult sequence of events that ultimately allows her to assess and actualize her own identity. Ukiko's Kabuki-Noh costume is a variation of the Japanese flag, her weapons are Ainu farming sickles, and her mask is based on her mother's face. * Scarab/Keiko - Considered the secondary character of the series, the codename \\"Scarab\\" was given to her because it is her duty to clean up the scenes left by the other Noh assassins, very much like the scarab beetle. Initially a street orphan alongside close friend Seiko, she encountered a young motorcycle hooligan named Yukio and quickly fell for him. Yukio's involvement with the Yakuza results in him and her friend Seiko being killed. Keiko was granted amnesty for her part by a government agent named Kenji in exchange for the infiltration of various underworld social groups. Alongside this she was also given combat and weaponry training, ultimately leading to her placement as a Noh assassin. Following Kabuki's betrayal, she and fellow agent Tigerlilly inadvertently form a deep friendship whilst in pursuit. Her Noh costume is a spiked, dominatrix-like bodysuit based on one of Yukio's drawings, and her mask bears a swirling insect-like pattern. * Tigerlilly - She is a fellow Noh assassin who befriends Scarab after being rescued by her, following a confrontation with Control Corps during their abduction of Kabuki. Very little is known about her early life, although she treasures her sister-like bond with Scarab, and often confides in her despite The Noh's strict no- fraternization policy. Before her life as a Noh operative, she was a comic book artist which was a profession she maintained as a cover-role while working as an assassin. When the agents invade the Control Corps installation, Tiger Lily vanishes, presumably to target Kabuki; it is assumed she survived the incident based on Akemi's letters in Kabuki Volume 6: The Alchemy. Also in this volume, Ukiko briefly encounters a woman comic artist on her airplane to America, with a very high suggestion that this may have been Tigerlilly's civilian persona. Her Noh costume was initially a very revealing set of lingerie, with her hair tied back in a French plait. On Scarab's advice, she switches to a more practical T-shirt and combat trousers. Her mask bears the stripes of her name, and she wields a short sword. * Siamese - A pair of twin assassins who always work together as one Noh agent unit, they are often sent on missions that require their unique synchronicity. Born conjoined at the arm, they each have a prosthetic replacement, other than this very little is known of their background. One sister (the left twin) is quite talkative and taunts her targets, whereas the other is more taciturn and chooses to talk only when situations require. Kabuki Volume 4: Skin Deep sees Siamese standing over Ukiko's corpse, presumably having killed her. With the entirety of the next two volumes acting as a flashback, Siamese take on a darkly, sinister tone, appearing briefly, but always after an act of brutal violence ‚Äì the build-up to their confrontation is slow and full of dread. Ironically the quiet right twin of the two is revealed to be a fan of Kabuki's on-screen persona and despairs over their mission. Siamese's Noh costumes are sleeveless T-shirts bearing the Japanese sun and rotations of stockings and trousers. The prosthetic arms act as weapons by being fitted with various attachments, and their masks are halved and monochromatic. * Ice - Nothing is revealed about this particular agent's identity or backstory. Ice's personality makes her prominent. She is the most dedicated of the Noh assassins, never questioning orders and correcting those who do so. In the wake of Kai's death, Ice takes the initiative and becomes the de facto field leader, directing the other agents to locate and eliminate Kabuki. Of all the agents, Ice's costume is the most inconsistent. Initially she has thin, wiry hair, a transparent bra, and armoured combat trousers, but on occasion, she sports razor-tipped cornrows and no chest cover at all. Ice's weapon set makes her one of the most formidable of the agents. Her arms are surgically adapted to contain sub-zero ice picks which she fires as weapons, and hence her name. Alongside this, her fingers are also diamond-tipped claws containing poison-tipped shurikens. Her Noh mask is relatively simple, with a curled spiral between the eyes. * Snapdragon - The most mysterious of all the agents, Snapdragon is depicted as being a quiet, observing individual, much like Kabuki although much more savage. There is a strong indication that Snapdragon is also just as dissociative but with a greater flair for ambush and violence. Snapdragon's costume includes gauntlets bearing the Japanese sun, a scant pair of black leather trousers and nipple tape, with occasional additions of netting and a matching jacket. The weaponry she wields includes a kusarigama chain-and-blade weapon. Snapdragon's mask bears a black band around the eyes like a blindfold, with a similar, thinner band from the mouth. * Butoh - The final Noh assassin, her codename literally translates as \\"Dancer\\", an apt name, considering the nature of her costume and weapons: a white ballet leotard and tights with razor-edged folding fans. Little is revealed about Butoh's past or even her present, though Volume 3: Masks of The Noh sheds a brief light on her thought process. She is very methodical, or even mechanical, in her training and activities for The Noh. She states that even she is not what she appears ‚Äì something which is never expanded upon. Her mask is a simple smiling face with rosy cheeks. All Noh assassins bear a dragon tattoo on the back. The dragon wings spread to cover both shoulders, while the tail reaches to the lower back area. A bulletproof kabuki mask covers the face, to conceal the identity. The mask is made of the ceramic lightweight material that used for Japanese bullet trains, and is stronger than metal. Boots and utility belts are included. The eyes of the mask are connected to a red visor, which allows the assassin to share their vision with the Noh via camera-link, all while processing data. The general color and clothing is black leather and silk, which makes it easy for an assassin to avoid detection while moving about in shadows and darkness. The silk is mostly used to cover the arms to conceal arm movements. The body armor worn is bulletproof. All assassins have individual designs to suit them. For example, spikes are worn as part of Scarab's assassin garb, because her armor design is based on a sketch that Yukio drew in his spare time. Scarab's appearance may be considered the most fancy look among the eight assassins. The Noh assassins are highly skilled with Neo Warsaw Pact and NATO firearms, Okinawan black market weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and attack and defense using the environment. The preferred weapons of choice are usually handguns, and various bladed weapons. The long fingernails are sometimes dipped in poisoned nail polish. Each assassin has her own favorite weapons that she normally prefers to carry out her missions. =The Kai Syndicate= * Ryuichi Kai is a politician who is also leader of the Kai Syndicate. He is the real father of Kabuki, from the time he raped and mutilated her mother. Upon learning of Ukiko's existence, he soon finds her and viciously scars her face with the word \\"kabuki\\", just as he did with her mother. An avid reader, he enjoys readings on philosophers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche in his spare time. * Cowboy is a photogenic criminal. * Johnny Yamamoto * Violet * Link Kinoshita =Other characters= * Seiko Saiton was Keiko's childhood friend who was also murdered by Yamamoto Gumi. She and Keiko first met at an orphanage. As a rebel, she has spent time going through different foster families, due to the indifference that she had towards groups, institutions, organizations, gangs, politics of organized religion, and rules in general. A practitioner of body modification, she has had her ears, eyebrows, and navel pierced. For this, she was often nicknamed \\"Voodoo Doll\\", as well as \\"Psycho- Seiko\\", due to her very short temper, and love of recklessness and confrontation. She believed in God and Christianity, and possessed good knowledge and understanding of the Holy Bible. * Tsukiko is the mother of Ukiko, who died while giving birth to her. A woman of Ainu descent, she was the lover of Ukiko's grandfather, but was raped and scarred by Kai out of resentment on the evening before her wedding. When the general found Tsukiko, her eyes were gone and the word \\"kabuki\\" had been carved into her back. Her name means \\"tsuki no musume („Å§„Åç„ÅÆ„ÇÄ„Åô„ÇÅ)\\" or \\"daughter of the moon\\". Ukiko often sees her in her dreams, and as able to describe her countenance. * Yukio is the deceased lover of Scarab, who was murdered by Yamamoto Gumi. Not much else is known about him, although he enjoyed sketching, collecting and creating figurines, and tinkering with his bike. He possibly was a writer, who enjoyed poetry, as well as pithy sayings. * Yamamoto Gumi is a group of Yakuza that Yukio once worked and ran errands for. * M.C. Square is another inmate at Control Corps. Lively and highly intelligent, she has an obsession with numbers, math, and arithmetic. * Akemi is a veterinarian/artist who works at the Little Friend Animal Clinic. A former Noh agent, the original Tigerlilly, she is Kabuki's fellow inmate at Control Corps, and helps her to survive and escape the institution. Is it suggested to the reader that either she and Ukiko are closer than friends, or is perhaps she is an alter-ego of Ukiko herself. Her name is a semi-homophonic similarity to the word \\"Alchemy.\\" * Kenji is a mysterious young man, who has connections to the Noh, as well as law. Not much is known about him, although he was responsible for the recruiting of Keiko. * General Kai is the father of Ryuchi, as well as Ukiko's grandfather. He was the husband of Tsukiko, but tragically is the grandfather of Ukiko, given the shameful truth that it was his own son who raped and scarred Tsukiko.

Besides writing the treatment, his credits include: Visual Designer, Creative Consultant and Co-Producer. The release date is unknown. Toys In the late 1990s, Moore Action Collectibles released several action figures and variants based on the character Kabuki; further releases were planned, but never came about. In 2004, Scarab received an action figure and variants from Diamond Select Toys. In 2005, a Kabuki Minimate was released in the Indie Comics Boxset along with Magdalena, Dawn and Witchblade. In 2009, Shocker Toys released a Kabuki figure as part of the first series of its \\"Indie Spotlight\\" line.Indie Spotlight 1: Kabuki review Figures of Kabuki, Tigerlily, Scarab and Siamese were released for the Heroclix collectable figure game by Wizkids / NECA. This was as part of the Indyclix expansion to the game. There were 3 versions each of Kabuki, Tigerlily, and Scarab, and only 1 of Siamese, which was a \\"Unique\\" figure and much rarer. Due to the sculptor using a particular comic panel for his image of Tigerlily, she was designed wealding twin Uzzi machine pistols rather than her usual blades, resulting in confusion among players and fans, as all 3 of her game pieces had no \\"range\\" value.

State Highway 7 passes through the southern part of the town, and State Highway 69 runs north to connect to . Ahaura is 44 km south-west of Reefton, Inangahua Junction is 34 km to the north, Maruia is 63 km to the east, and the Lewis Pass is 66 km to the south-east. In 1888 Reefton became the first town in New Zealand and the Southern Hemisphere to receive electricity, the work of Walter Prince, and its streets were lit by commercial electricity generated by the Reefton Power Station. The Reefton Power House Charitable Trust Inc has raised $4.5 million for a restructure project and work started on buildings and a water race in 2019. The population was 927 in the 2018 census, down from 1056 in the 2013 census. Reefton is home to the Inangahua County Library. Name The rich veins of gold found in a quartz reef near the town led to its name, originally spelled \\"Reef Town\\". Two nicknames in use soon after it was founded were \\"Rest Town\\" and \\"Quartzopolis\\". The main street, Broadway, was named after West Coast magistrate Charles Broad. The nearby Wealth of Nations mine was named after Adam Smith's book because the gold been discovered by another Adam Smith (no relation).  Mining  Gold was first discovered near the town in 1866, although the major discovery was made in 1870. An earlier settlement, known as Ross Town, had been established on the opposite bank of the Inangahua River around 1870, but most businesses shifted across the river in 1871 to be nearer the quartz mining. Soon after, the town briefly boasted a population of several thousand. This later dwindled to less than a thousand. Other industries in the town are coal mining, forestry, tourism and angling. A new gold mine is planned to open in 2024, it is expected to employ 100 people. Locally received radio stations include repeaters of both The Hits from Greymouth and Coast FM from Westport. The Greymouth Star newspaper is also received daily in the town. Railways Reefton is located on the Stillwater‚ÄìWestport Line railway, which diverges from the Midland Line in Stillwater. On 29 February 1892, the line was opened to Reefton, but it terminated on the southern bank of the Inangahua River opposite the town. Early in the 20th century, a bridge was built across the river and the present-day station established in Reefton. The line was opened beyond Reefton to Cronadun in 1908, but it was not until 5 December 1943 that the line officially became a through route to Westport, though trains had been operating the length of the line since July 1942. On 3 August 1936, a railcar passenger service began operating in the morning between Hokitika and Reefton utilising small Leyland diesel railcars, but low patronage meant this service ceased to operate all the way to Reefton in August 1938. In the early 1940s, much larger Vulcan railcars were introduced to New Zealand and they provided two services to Reefton: one local service from Greymouth that terminated in Reefton, and a service that ran between Westport and Stillwater to connect with the West Coast Express. In 1967, all passenger services through Reefton ceased. Today, the primary traffic on the railway is coal, with multiple coal trains operating daily. Climate Located in the Inangahua Valley at an altitude of 194m, Reefton falls under the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification of Cfb (Oceanic). At an average temperature of 15.9 ¬∞C, February is the warmest month. July is the coldest month, at 6.8 ¬∞C. Reefton's average annual temperature is 11.4 ¬∞C. Snowfall happens about once or twice every winter, with sleet occurring more frequently. Reefton experiences temperatures below freezing on about 15-20 mornings each winter. During the summer, it is not uncommon for temperatures to reach above 25 ¬∞C, but days above 30 ¬∞C only happen on a few summer afternoons per year.

He is generally considered to be a member of the Roman School, though unusually for the group he seems to have written only madrigals. Information on his early life is scarce. He was born in Verona, lived in Rome in 1582 in the service of Cardinal Filippo Boncompagni, and then in the next year traveled throughout Calabria, probably looking for a job as an organist. In 1584 and 1585 he held a series of part-time posts at various churches in Rome. Orvieto Cathedral hired him in 1587, but he did not stay long, returning to Verona in 1589. In the early 1590s he returned to Rome for reasons unknown, and died there. According to his epitaph, Pope Clement VIII granted him the title Knight of the Golden Spur. Bellasio published five books of madrigals, in a well-crafted, conservative and contrapuntal idiom. In addition he wrote a book of villanelle which included a part for lute, as well as a group of canzonettas. The lack of sacred music in his output is striking, especially for a Roman at the end of the 16th century, though perhaps some of his music has not survived.

Biography Jean Le Bel's father, Gilles le Beal des Changes, was an alderman of Liege. Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327, and took part in the border warfare against the Scots. His will is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370. Nothing more is known of his life, but Jacques de Hemricourt, author of the Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye, has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality. Hemricourt asserts that he was eighty years old or more when he died. Chronicles Jean was one of the first chroniclers to write in French instead of Latin. He was a soldier and companion of Jean, Count de Beaumont and travelled with him to England and Scotland in 1327. At the request of the duke, he wrote Vrayes Chroniques (\\"True Chronicles\\"), which recorded the events of the reign of Edward III. He is believed to be the first person to use interviews to confirm and supplement his facts. Jean gives as his reason for writing a desire to replace a certain misleading rhymed chronicle of the wars of Edward III by a true relation of his enterprises down to the beginning of the Hundred Years' War. For a long time Jean was only known as a chronicler through a reference by Jean Froissart; Froissart was greatly influenced by him and borrowed from his texts. Froissart names him in the prologue of the first book of his Chronicles as one of his authorities, and incorporates Le Bel's own text, verbatim and at length, in his own book. Le Bel's own chronicle is only preserved in a single, anonymous manuscript. A fragment of his work in the manuscript of Jean d'Outremeuse's Ly Myreur des Histors, was discovered in 1847; and the whole of his chronicle, preserved in the library of Ch√°lons-sur- Marne, was edited in 1863 by L. Polain. In the matter of style Le Bel has been placed by some critics on the level of Froissart. His chief merit is his refusal to narrate events unless either he himself or his informant had witnessed them. This scrupulousness in the acceptance of evidence must be set against his limitations. He takes on the whole a similar point of view to Froissart's; he has no concern with national movements or politics; and, writing for the public of chivalry, he preserves no general notion of a campaign, which resolves itself in his narrative into a series of exploits on the part of his heroes. Froissart was considerably indebted to him, and seems to have borrowed from him some of his best-known episodes, such as the death of Robert the Bruce, Edward III and the countess of Salisbury, and the devotion of the burghers of Calais. The songs and virelais, in the art of writing which he was, according to Hemricourt, an expert, have not come to light.

It consists of three settled areas: Inangahua Junction at the confluence of the Inangahua and Buller Rivers, north of Reefton and southeast of Westport; Inagahua Landing, 10 km further up the Inangahua River; and Inangauhua township, 2 km east of the Junction. Murchison is further east. After the 1968 Inangahua Earthquake, most of the inhabitants left the area or shifted to the township, which is now the population centre and known simply as Inangahua. Inangahua's main industries include forestry, coal, farming and sawmilling. There is a small primary school, shops, fire station and earthquake museum. The population of Inangahua and its surrounds was 144 in the 2013 census, a decrease of 15 people from 2006.  Name  The name of the town refers to inanga, the MƒÅori word for whitebait (Galaxias spp.) and hua, the act of drying and preserving them in sealed containers; the river was known for its abundance of fish. Inangahua Junction was formerly known as Christies Junction.  Inangahua Landing  Rail bridge at Inangahua Landing Before the construction of the Buller Gorge road, the only way to travel inland from Westport was by river. At the beginning of the West Coast gold rush, mining equipment and quartz-crushing machinery was ferried up the Buller River to its confluence with the Inangahua, then about 10 km up the Inanghua as far as \\"The Landing\\", from which it was transported overland south to Reefton. At the height of the gold rush over 1000 prospectors were working in tributaries of the Inangahua. Earthquake Inangahua Junction bridge after the 1968 earthquake The town was substantially affected by an earthquake on Friday, 24 May 1968. At 5:24 am, the earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck the town, and many landslides and aftershocks followed. The entire population of around 100 was temporarily evacuated. There were no fatalities in the town, but a woman and her visiting mother were killed when the house they were in, along the Inangahua Junction to Westport road, was crushed by a landslide on the cliffs above their house, while a man died near Greymouth when his car hit a section of road on that suddenly subsided on the run-up to a bridge. Another three died days later when a helicopter surveying downed telephone lines crashed. Railways Inangahua Junction is located on the Stillwater - Westport Line railway, and was intended to be the junction of this line with the never-completed Nelson Section. In 1914, the railway was opened to Inangahua Junction from its former terminus in Cronadun, but subsequent progress through the Buller Gorge was slow. In July 1942, trains began running the full length of the line between Stillwater and Westport, but the line was not officially opened until 5 December 1943. With the commencement of through services, passenger trains were operated by RM class Vulcan railcars, which connected in Stillwater with services that ran along the Midland Line between Greymouth and Christchurch. In 1967, the passenger services ceased, and today, the primary traffic is coal, with multiple coal trains passing through Inangahua Junction daily. Today the town is served by the daily inter city bus between Nelson and Westport. PHAT Music Festival Inangaha was the host of the PHAT New Year's Eve music festivals. PHAT07, PHAT08, PHAT09, PHAT10 (with Australian band Pendulum and NZers Black Seeds, Kora, Salmonella Dub, Tiki and Concord Dawn), PHAT11 featured New Zealand and many international acts. PHAT is held on flat clearings surrounded by native bush on Rough Creek Road, off Browns Creek Road, south of Inangahua and owned by the Storer family. Approximately 5000 people attend the PHAT music festivals, with 48+ hours of continuous performance on two stages. The milk tanker arrives, Inangahua Junction 1978.The other annual event held on the Inangahua site was PHAT MOON, a slightly smaller version of the bigger New Year's Eve's event. PHAT MOON was held over Easter weekend. The music runs for 24 hours, but people are invited to come and camp the night before. This ceased quite a few years ago; the site has returned to being a farm. Education Inangahua Junction School is a coeducational contributing primary (years 1‚Äì6) school with a decile rating of 6 and a roll of 9. The school was in existence in 1887. Inangahua College merged with Reefton School to form Reefton Area School in 2004. The College, which existed for 38 years, replaced the Reefton District High School.

It is the sixth book in the Redwall series. It is also one of the three Redwall novels to be made into a TV series.  Subdivisions  *The Prisoner and the Tyrant *Actors and Searchers *The Battle of Marshank Plot US cover of Martin the Warrior Martin the Warrior tells the story of a young mouse named Martin, a slave in Marshank under the cruel stoat Badrang the Tyrant. When Badrang leaves Martin to be tortured by the weather and the birds, a young mousemaid named Laterose, or Rose (whom Martin falls in love with) and a mole named Grumm hear his cry of defiance. They become instrumental in helping Martin, along with a squirrel named Felldoh, and Rose's brother Brome, escape Marshank. When that is accomplished, they decide to travel to Noonvale to rouse an army to attack Marshank. However, in the ocean, Felldoh and Brome are separated from Rose, Martin, and Grumm. Felldoh and Brome meet up with the Rambling Rosehip Players, a travelling band of creatures, and join forces with them, eventually freeing the slaves as Brome bluffs his way into and out of Marshank, disguised as a rat from Badrang's horde. Meanwhile, Martin, Rose and Grumm meet a hedgehog named Pallum after being imprisoned by pigmy shrews. They are eventually freed by saving the life of the Pygmy Queen's son, Dinjer, along with Pallum, who in turn joins up with them. After a long series of adventures, the four adventurers reach Noonvale, Rose and Grumm's home. They gather an army there, but it is not large enough. But all is not lost. Boldred, a scholarly owl whom they met on the way to Noonvale, helps gather a huge army, including the pigmy shrews and the Gawtrybe (a group of savage squirrels). The entire army then sails to Marshank and reach it in good timing, since the Rambling Rosehip Players are in a predicament. Badrang and all of the vermin under his command, with the exception of mad Cap'n Tramun Clogg, are slain. Rose is killed in the final battle by the very tyrant she had gone with Martin to defeat. After the battle, Martin, along with Ballaw, Rowanoak, Brome, and Keyla all stay in Polleekin's treehouse for the short rest of the season. Martin is devastated, his one love gone, and has nowhere to go. He declines going back to Noonvale with the rest, the memory of Laterose lingering too strong, not to mention he'll have to tell Urran Voh what had happened to his daughter. He makes a vow not to tell anyone about his friends or Noonvale, to protect them from enemies. He decides simply to relate a tale of living by the sword in the caves until the time came to move on southward. The story of Martin and Rose is later brought to Redwall during the time of Abbot Saxtus by Aubretia, a descendant of Brome, and Bultip, a descendant of Pallum, who brought a sprig of climbing-rose culled from that which grew on Rose of Noonvale's grave. This becomes the Laterose of Redwall. In the passing of Spring to Summer, it blooms year round a bit later than the rest, and that is why it is called the Laterose.

Werker and starring Vincent Price, Lynn Bari and Frank Latimore.. Plot A psychiatrist, Dr. Cross (Vincent Price), is treating a young woman, Janet Stewart (Anabel Shaw), who is in a coma-state, brought on when she heard loud arguing, went to her window and saw a man strike his wife with a candlestick and kill her. Lynn Bari is Dr. Cross's nurse/lover, Elaine Jordan. As Stewart comes out of her shock, she recognizes Dr. Cross as the killer. He then takes her to his sanitarium and at Elaine's urging, gives Janet an overdose of insulin under the pretense of administering insulin shock therapy. He can't bring himself to murder her in cold blood, though, and asks Elaine to get the medicine to save her. Elaine refuses, they argue, and he strangles her. A colleague of Dr. Cross, Dr. Harvey, saves Janet's life and Dr. Cross is taken into custody by a lawyer from the District Attorney's office.

Reception Above and beyond the typical characteristics of the horror film genre, reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times took particular offense to the film's treatment of Price as a psychiatrist who attempts to do away with his patient, a woman who has lost her mind after witnessing the murder her own doctor had committed. Coming in the wake of World War II, in which so many people had suffered shock and could benefit from treatment of their anxieties, Crowther asked the \\"critical observer to protest in no uncertain tones\\" the movie's \\"social disservice\\" in its fostering \\"apprehension against the treatment of nervous disorders\\", deploring the lack of consideration for those in need of treatment evidenced by producer Aubrey Schenck and distributor Twentieth Century-Fox.Crowther, Bosley. \\"The Screen; Bad Medicine\\", The New York Times, March 9, 1946.

Early life Saari was born in Sein√§joki, Finland. His mother was supportive of his skateboarding and his first skateboard was a Vision Gator model. Skateboarding Saari first attracted attention from the global skateboarding community when he competed at the world championship event in Munster, Germany in 1998 at the age of 16 years. Following the event, Saari was invited by professional skateboarder Danny Way to tour Canada with Plan B, Platinum, and the Red Dragons teams, and received a mailed airline ticket at his family home. However, Saari's professional skateboarding career commenced following his decision to relocate to the United States with Flip and he has rode for the company for most of his professional career. Saari was selected as the \\"2001 Skater of the Year\\" by Thrasher. After receiving the award, Saari stated, \\"I never thought it would actually like ... whatever, happen to me, or what not. Like, it's just one of those things that's just come out of the blue, you know?\\" In what was perceived as a shocking decision by the global skateboard community, Saari announced his decision to leave Flip in 2008 due to the distress that was caused by the death of Flip rider Shane Cross. In an interview with skateboard journalist, Chris Nieratko, following his decision (Saari later contacted Nieratko to prevent the interview from being published and the journalist published it on his personal website instead), Saari explained the process of leaving Flip: > It was really heavy but they [Flip] took it pretty good. I thought they were > going to come and chop my legs off but they were very reasonable about it > but it‚Äôs been a heavy process. It‚Äôs been on good terms. I just felt like I > had to move on. I changed all my other sponsors, I might as well. Why stop > now? New knee, new liver, new shoe company, new board sponsor ... Yeah, I > did shed a few tears. It‚Äôs like getting a divorce; even though I‚Äôve never > been married other than Flip. I can imagine it‚Äôs something like that. > There‚Äôs parts that you like but there‚Äôs parts that you just want to move on > past. It‚Äôs really hard to deal with. You wonder, ‚ÄòAre you going to lose > friends? Are you going to lose business?‚Äô It was a tough decision to make > and I‚Äôm still spun out about it. I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs all happening but > I think it will be for the better for everyone ... I just couldn‚Äôt take it > any longer. I couldn‚Äôt take the madness and I thought it would be better to > move on than to stay somewhere where I don‚Äôt think I necessarily belong > anymore. Things have changed a lot over the years and I thought it would be > better to explore something new, to be like a little kid in a candy store. In the Nieratko interview, Saari also discussed Rowley's response to his decision: > ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it.‚Äù He knew it had to happen. We‚Äôre still cool. He understands. > He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúGo do your thing. Go skate around.‚Äù It was a very, very > emotional, gnarly thing. It‚Äôs been so many years in the same boat you have > to start going in different ways. Sometimes the ship gets too small, too > many egos, you got to jump overboard and catch the next one and see where > that takes you. In 2012, Saari provided further insight into his decision to leave Flip, citing the death of former teammate, Shane Cross, as a significant underpinning factor: \\"It wasn't, like, a easy thing to do, but, at the time, I knew I had to do it ... for the reasons that happened, you know? And that's why I decided that it's better off for me to leave Flip than, just, go my own way and, just, do that.\\" Professional skateboarder, Ed Templeton, stated in a 2012 interview: \\"I mean I was completely shocked when he left Flip ... it didn't make sense.\\" At the start of January 2011, Flip announced that Saari had rejoined the team and released an image that featured Saari alongside the caption: \\"Home is Where the Hearto Is\\". A video segment was also published on the website of Thrasher magazine and featured Rowley, Saari and Thrasher editor-in-chief, Jake Phelps, discussing the decision in Phelps' office in San Francisco, US. Saari explained to Phelps that Flip is like \\"family\\" and stated \\"You can take a man out of Flip, but you can't take the Flip out the man\\". In 2012, Fox disclosed the process of re-recruiting Saari: > I went up and saw him with Geoff, one day, because it seemed like he really > ... well, I could tell; we could all tell that he wanted to be back on the > team. Arto's not a very pushy person, at all. Never the guy who will ask for > anything, and I just said to Geoff one day, \\"Let's just, we need to drive up > there and then, and just put him back on the team. Make him put himself back > on; because, otherwise, this is never going to happen.\\" Maybe he'd grown up > and realized that it might be a little dysfunctional family, but it is my > family. Also in 2012, Rowley confirmed that \\"It came from Arto, you know, saying that, like, this is where he belonged, kinda thing ... We know each other long enough to know, when you're hanging out with someone that, hey, like, okay, he's ready now.\\" Saari has also stated: > It was a pretty unspoken thing. It wasn't until the last minute that, it was > like, \\"You wanna get back on?\\" I was like, \\"Yeah\\". We [Rowley and Saari] > probably didn't talk for like a year or two. There was this vibe. That's how > I grew up skating; those are the guys who brought me up, backed me up. And I > was, like, \\"You know what? I gotta, I gotta get back on.\\" Alongside professional skateboarders Stevie Williams, Brandon Biebel, and Tony Alva, Saari completed a photo and video shoot for Playboy that was shot by Irish photographer Tony Kelly. The shoot is entitled \\"Playboy Poolside\\" and features the four subjects skateboarding in and around an empty swimming pool. In a February 2014 radio interview with Thrasher magazine, Saari identified his video part in Flip's Sorry as the video appearance that he is most proud of. Saari has had several major injuries during his career. Saari was nineteen years of age when he almost died of brain injuries, suffered as he was warming up for the execution of a trick on a handrail. The incident was represented in the form of a cartoon in Flip's first video, Sorry. Saari appears as a playable character in the video games Evolution Skateboarding, Tony Hawk's Underground, and Tony Hawk's Proving Ground. =Sponsors= As of July 2014, Saari is sponsored by Flip Skateboards, New Balance Numeric, WeSC, Ricta, CCS, MOB, Destructo Trucks and hOme Watches. In late 2012, the Burton company announced a major restructure in accordance with a plan to focus more closely on its core business; consequently, the skateboard teams of the Gravis and Analog brands were dissolved. Saari's move to WeSC was announced on April 26, 2013, following Saari's selection as the first skateboarder of the international team of hOme Watches‚Äîalongside snowboarders Travis Rice, Gigi R√ºf and Mark Sollors‚Äîin the previous month. Then, in May 2013, Saari was announced as a member of the New Balance Numeric skate footwear team. =Video parts= * √©S: Menikmati (2000) * Flip: Sorry (2002) * Flip: Really Sorry (2004) * Flip: Feast Tour (2006) * Alien Workshop: Mind Field (2009) Photography Leica Camera AG, a German manufacturer of cameras, lenses, projectors, sport optics, high-aperture and laser rangefinder binoculars, and spotting scopes, initiated an interview series with skateboard journalist, Mark Whiteley (former editor of SLAP magazine), in January 2013.

In early 2013, Saari was selected as the photographer for the \\"Fear and Loathing in Australia\\" Oakley skateboard tour that featured the sunglasses brand's team riders: Eric Koston, Rune Glifberg, Ryan Sheckler, and Curren Caples. The Oakley site explained that Saari was employed for advertisement campaigns and gallery shows, while his demand as a photographer is equivalent to his popularity at the height of his skateboarding career.

Early life Mattingly was born in Anderson, Indiana, on January 7, 1931. He served four years in the United States Air Force and was stationed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia, in the early 1950s. In 1957, he earned a bachelor of science degree in marketing from Indiana University.Dowis, Richard: The lost art of the great speech: how to write it, how to deliver it. See page 207. Afterward, he worked for twenty years for IBM Corporation in Georgia and later operated his own business, M's Inc., which sold office supplies and equipment in Brunswick, Georgia. Early political career Mattingly first became active in politics in 1964 when he served as chairman of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater's campaign for President in Georgia's 8th congressional district.Lee Cokorinos, The Assault on Diversity: An Organized Challenge to Racial and Gender Justice, p. 108. Goldwater carried Georgia. Two years later, Mattingly would help Bo Callaway organize the Georgia Republican Party and joined his ticket as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives against Congressman W. S. Stuckey, Jr. Mattingly lost the race but was elected a member of the Georgia Republican Party State Executive Committee and served as Vice Chairman from 1968 until 1975. He served as Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party from 1975 to 1977 when he began exploring a race for the U.S. Senate. U.S. Senate tenure In 1980, Mattingly scored a historic upset, defeating longtime Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge, outpolling Ronald Reagan who lost the state in the Presidential election to Jimmy Carter. Mattingly served in the Senate from January 1981 until January 1987, with membership on the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, chairing first the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch and later the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Mattingly also served at various times on the Senate Banking Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Joint Economic Committee and the Ethics Committee. He is perhaps best remembered as a proponent of the line-item veto, a position that earned him recognition by President Ronald Reagan during his 1985 State of the Union Address. Post senatorial career In November 1986, Mattingly was narrowly defeated in his bid for re-election by former Congressman Wyche Fowler of Atlanta. In 1987, Reagan appointed Mattingly assistant secretary-general for defense support for NATO in Brussels, Belgium. In 1988, Mattingly received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush appointed Mattingly ambassador to Seychelles.

Along with Greco-Roman, it is one of the two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic Games. American high school and men's college wrestling is conducted under different rules and is termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling. American collegiate women's wrestling is conducted under freestyle rules. Freestyle wrestling, like collegiate wrestling, has its greatest origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling. In both styles the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Unlike Greco-Roman, freestyle and collegiate wrestling allow the use of the wrestler's or the opponent's legs in offense and defense. Freestyle wrestling brings together traditional wrestling, judo, and sambo techniques. According to wrestling's world governing body, United World Wrestling (UWW), freestyle wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today. The other five forms are Greco-Roman wrestling, grappling/submission wrestling, beach wrestling, pankration athlima, alysh/belt wrestling and traditional/folk wrestling.Fila Wrestling : site de la F√©d√©ration Internationale des Luttes Associ√©es The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended dropping wrestling as a sport from the 2020 Olympic Games, but the decision was later reversed by the IOC. History Freestyle wrestling has been in the Olympic Games since the 1904 Olympics in Saint Louis, Missouri. Modern freestyle wrestling, according to UWW (formerly FILA), is said to have originated in Great Britain and the United States by the name of \\"catch-as- catch-can\\" wrestling. \\"Catch-as-catch-can\\" wrestling had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on freestyle wrestling.\\"Wrestling, Freestyle\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996). \\"Catch-as-catch-can\\" wrestling gained great popularity in fairs and festivals during the 19th century. In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent's shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A Scottish variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular, which began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body and, if no fall was made, with the match continuing on the ground. In addition, there was the Irish collar-and-elbow style, where wrestlers started out on their feet with both wrestlers grasping each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. If neither wrestler then achieved a fall, the contestants would continue both standing and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style of wrestling to the United States, where it soon became widespread, especially because of the success of the wrestling champion of the Army of the Potomac, George William Flagg from Vermont. Catch- as-catch can was the style performed by at least a half dozen U.S. presidents, including George Washington, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt. Because of the widespread interest in and esteem of professional Greco-Roman wrestling and its popularity in many international meets in nineteenth century Europe, freestyle wrestling (and wrestling as an amateur sport in general) had a tough time gaining ground on the continent. The 1896 Olympic Games had only one wrestling bout, a heavyweight Greco-Roman match. Freestyle wrestling first emerged as an Olympic sport in the St. Louis Olympics of 1904. All 40 wrestlers who participated in the 1904 Olympics were American. The 1904 Olympics sanctioned the rules commonly used for catch-as-catch-can, but imposed some restrictions on dangerous holds. Wrestling by seven weight classes‚Äî47.6 kg (104.9 lb), 52.2 kg (115.1 lb), 56.7 kg (125.0 lb), 61.2 kg (134.9 lb), 65.3 kg (143.9 lb), 71.7 kg (156.7 lb), and greater than ‚Äîwas an important innovation in the Summer Olympics. Since 1921, the body now known as United World Wrestling (UWW), which has its headquarters near Lausanne, Switzerland, has set the \\"Rules of the Game\\", with regulations for scoring and procedures that govern tournaments such as the World Games and the competition at the Summer Olympics. These were later adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) for its freestyle matches. Freestyle wrestling gained great popularity in the United States after the Civil War. By the 1880s, tournaments drew hundreds of wrestlers. The rise of cities, increased industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the affable environment for amateur wrestling, along with boxing, to increase in esteem and popularity. Amateur wrestling teams soon emerged, such as the wrestling team of the New York Athletic Club, which had its first tournament in 1878. Professional wrestling also developed, and by the 1870s, professional championship matches offered allowances of up to $1,000. Nineteenth century wrestling matches were particularly long, and especially Greco-Roman bouts (where holds below the waist and the use of the legs are not allowed) could last as many as eight to nine hours, and even then, it was only decided by a draw.\\"Wrestling, Greco-Roman\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1196, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996). In the 20th century, time limits were set for matches.\\"Wrestling, Freestyle\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996) For more than forty years into the twentieth century, freestyle and its American counterpart, collegiate wrestling, did not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall. The introduction of a point system by Oklahoma State University wrestling coach Art Griffith gained acceptance in 1941 and influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match's end. Dr. Albert de Ferrari from San Francisco who became vice president of FILA (now UWW), lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for \\"controlled fall\\", which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle. By 1996, before a major overhaul of FILA rules, an international freestyle match consisted of two three-minute periods, with a one-minute rest between periods. Today, wrestlers from post-Soviet states, Iran, the United States, Bulgaria, Cuba, Turkey, and Japan have had the strongest showings. Alexander Medved of Belarus won 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals from 1964 to 1972. Many collegiate wrestlers have moved on to freestyle competition, particularly internationally with great success.\\"Wrestling, Freestyle\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1193, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996). In the spring of 2013, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted wrestling out of the core sports for the summer Olympics beginning in 2020http://espn.go.com/olympics/wrestling/story/_/id/8939185/ioc-drops- wrestling-2020-olympics As a result of this news the wrestling community started a massive campaign in order to reinstate the sport. A largely online group called 2020 vision lead the movement. They had several campaigns as well as Facebook and Twitter pages that spread awareness and gathered support for the cause of wrestling's return to the Olympics. They had a mission of gaining 2,000,020 signatures (online and offline) in support of wrestling's return to the Olympic Games. In September 2013 the IOC voted to allow wrestling back into the Olympics for 2020 and 2024 as a probationary sport. In order to achieve this, UWW made several changes to the rules as well as changes to the weight classes.http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/9650530/wrestling-gets- reinstated-2020-olympics There are also discussions about uniform changes as well as changes to the competition mat. Weight classes This freestyle wrestler locks the limbs of his opponent in order to take him down to the mat. Currently, international men's freestyle wrestling is divided into six main age categories: schoolboys, cadets, novice, juvenile, juniors, and seniors. Schoolboys( boys ages 14‚Äì15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young boys ages 16‚Äì17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young boys ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (men ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . For men, there is also a special category for some freestyle competitions, \\"Veterans\\", for men ages 35 and older, presumably featuring the same weight classes as seniors. Also, all of the men's age categories and weight classes can be applied to Greco-Roman wrestling. Women currently compete in freestyle wrestling in one of four age categories on an international level: schoolgirls, cadets, juniors, and seniors. Schoolgirls (young women ages 14‚Äì15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young women ages 16‚Äì17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young women ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (women ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . Wrestlers after weigh-in may only wrestle in their own weight class. Wrestlers in the senior age category may wrestle up a weight class except for the heavyweight division (which starts at a weight more than for the men and more than for the women). Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of freestyle competition. Structure of the tournament A typical international wrestling tournament takes place by direct elimination with an ideal number of wrestlers (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.) in each weight class and age category competing for placement. The competition in each weight class takes place in one day. The day before the wrestling in a scheduled weight class and age category takes place, all the applicable wrestlers are examined by a physician and weighed-in. Each wrestler after being weighed on the scale then draws a token randomly that gives a certain number. If an ideal number is not reached to begin elimination rounds, a qualification round will take place to eliminate the excess number of wrestlers. For example, 22 wrestlers may weigh-in over the ideal number of 16 wrestlers. The six wrestlers who drew the highest numbers after 16 and the six wrestlers who drew the six numbers immediately before 17 would then wrestle in six matches in the qualification round. The winners of those matches would then go on to the elimination round. In the elimination round or \\"blood round\\", the ideal number of wrestlers then pair off and compete in matches until two victors emerge who will compete in the finals for first and second place. All of the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists then have the chance to wrestle in a repechage round. The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round. The matches are paired off by the wrestlers who lost to one finalist and the wrestlers who lost to the other. The two wrestlers who win after every level of competition are the victors of the repechage round. In the finals, the two victors of the elimination round compete for first and second place. In all rounds of the tournament, the wrestlers compete in matches paired off in the order of the numbers they drew after the weigh-in. After the finals match, the awards ceremony will take place. The first place and second place wrestlers will receive a gold and silver medal, respectively. (At the FILA World Championships, the first place wrestler will receive the World Championship Belt.) The two repechage round winners will each be awarded third place with a bronze medal. The two wrestlers who lost in the finals for the third place are awarded fifth place. From seventh place down, the wrestlers are ranked according to the classification points earned for their victories or losses. If there is a tie among wrestlers for classification points, the ranking is determined in this order from the highest to the lowest: * Most victories earned by fall * Most matches won by technical superiority * Most periods won by technical superiority * Most points scored in the tournament * Fewest points scored in the tournament Wrestlers who remained tied after that will be awarded placements \\"ex aequo.\\" Wrestlers classified from the fifth to the 10th place will receive a special diploma. The wrestling tournaments in the Olympic Games and the Senior and Junior World Championships are designed to take place over three days on three mats. Layout of the mat The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a border of the same thickness known as the protection area. Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter (3 ft 3 in) in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the red zone. The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the passivity zone. Inside the red zone is the central wrestling area which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central surface of wrestling is the central circle, which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters (4 in) wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters (3 in) in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, red and blue. For competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters (6 ft 6 in), the sides of the podium are covered with 45¬∞ (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat. Equipment * A singlet is a one-piece wrestling garment made of spandex that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or lycra and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet. * A special pair of shoes is worn by the wrestler to increase their mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler's feet a better grip on the mat. * A handkerchief, also called a bloodrag, is carried in the singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt to stop the bleeding or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat. * Headgear, equipment worn around the ears to protect the wrestler, is optional in freestyle. Headgear is omitted at the participant's own risk, as there is the potential to develop cauliflower ear. The match A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In freestyle wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials (referees) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman). =Session format= singlet scores points over the wrestler in the red singlet to win by decision. In Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is two three-minute sessions. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls both of them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the session. A wrestler wins the match when he has outscored his opponent at the end of the two three-minute sessions. For example, if one competitor were to score four points in the first session and his opponent two, and then two in the second session, his opponent zero, the competitor would win. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in session termination. In freestyle, if no wrestler scores in two minutes, the referee of the match will then identify the more passive wrestler, and that wrestler will be given a thirty-second window of opportunity to score, and if he doesn't, then his opponent will be awarded a point. When the session (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table. Both wrestlers then approach each other, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent's coach. =Match scoring= In freestyle wrestling, as well as in Greco-Roman wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways: * Takedown (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head). ::(5 points):5 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or par terre position into a direct and immediate danger position. ::(4 points): 4 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude as in the 5-point throw, but does not put the opponent into a direct and immediate danger position or if the opposing wrestler maintains contact with at least one hand on the mat. ::(3 points): Generally, three points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a short amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler's opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position. ::(2 points):Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat and while in this position holding him down with control. * Reversal (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent). Two United States military servicemen grapple in a freestyle wrestling championship match. * Exposure also called the Danger Position (2 or 3 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent's back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if one's back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler's opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler's opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent's shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler's opponent is in an \\"instantaneous fall\\" position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler's opponent rolls on his shoulders. A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points. An additional hold-down point may be earned by maintaining the exposure continuously for five seconds. * Penalty (1 or 2 points): Under the 2004-2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, using illegal holds, etc.) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a Caution, and a choice of position to the opponent. A wrestler whose opponent regularly refuses to take an ordered hold is awarded a point. Three cautions automatically result in the match being awarded to the opponent. * Out-of-Bounds (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent. * Passivity (1 point): A point awarded to the attacking wrestler whose opponent flees the hold or refuses to start. Classification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser. The full determinations for scoring are found https://unitedworldwrestling.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/wrestling_rules.pdf in the UWW International Wrestling Rules]. Victory conditions collegiate (scholastic or folkstyle) wrestling, the main style done in U.S. high schools, colleges, and universities, freestyle wrestling involves a greater emphasis on explosive action by both wrestlers, as opposed to one wrestler's dominance and control of the other. A match can be won in the following ways: * Win by Fall: The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents' shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to \\"observe the total control of the fall\\" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made. (If the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall.) A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs. * Win by Technical Superiority (Also called Technical Fall): If at any point during the match, a wrestler gains a ten-point lead over his opponent, the wrestler would win the match by technical fall. * Win by Decision: If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during match is declared the winner. * Win by Default: If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal. * Win by Injury: If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a medical forfeit or injury default. The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. If a wrestler is injured by his opponent's illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified. * Win by Disqualification: Normally, if a wrestler is assessed three Cautions for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality, the match may be ended immediately and the wrestler disqualified and removed from the tournament. The wrestler on top secures the fall in this freestyle wrestling match. =Team scoring in tournaments= In an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60 kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the team with the most points wins the team competition. =Team competition= A team competition or dual meet is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the home competition and one winning the away competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the fewest technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament. Women's freestyle wrestling At the collegiate, world, and Olympic levels, women wrestle freestyle. During competition the wrestlers will either wear a red singlet or blue singlet depending on where they are placed in the bracket. All female competitors are required to wear a women‚Äôs cut singlet with proper fitting to minimize any distracting incidents. In addition to colleges and universities, there are programs like the Beat the Streets-Girls Wrestling Program. This organization is highly successful at targeting inner city kids and introducing them to the world of wrestling at no cost. Other notable organizations include Chick Wrestler, which was created in January 2012 to market and promote women‚Äôs wrestling at the Olympic Level. Freestyle wrestling was added to the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program effective with the 2020‚Äì21 school year. At that time, 35 NCAA members sponsored women's wrestling teams. Women‚Äôs wrestling made its Olympic Debut in Athens 2004. Typically the females have 7 weight classes (48 kg, 51 kg, 55 kg, 59 kg, 63 kg, 67 kg, 72 kg) that compete in a World Championships. Though, during the Olympic year, the weights are reduced to only 4 (48 kg, 55 kg, 63 kg, and 72 kg).http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle Only one representative from each weight class is permitted to enter Olympic Competition.

As such, intravenous or intracavity administration of 89Sr may be helpful in the palliation of painful bony metastases, as it allows for targeted radiation to metastatic lesions, inducing apoptosis of cells, membrane and protein damage. Subsequently, bone pain resulting from cytokine release at the site of lesions, bone-associated nerve compression and stretching of the periosteum may be reduced. Treatment with 89Sr has been particularly effective in patients with hormonally-resistant prostate cancer, often leading to a decreased requirement for opioid analgesics, an increase in time until further radiation, and a decrease in tumour markers. It is an artificial radioisotope which is used in treatment of bone cancer. In circumstances where cancer patients have widespread and painful bony metastases, the administration of 89Sr results in the delivery of beta particles directly to the area of bony problem, where calcium turnover is greatest.

He was a strong advocate for citizen participation who founded Common Cause and became known as \\"the father of campaign finance reform\\". Biography A native of California, Gardner attended Stanford University. As an undergrad he set several swimming records and won a number of Pacific Coast championships, and graduated \\"with great distinction.\\" After earning a Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1938, Dr. Gardner taught at Connecticut College and at Mount Holyoke. During the early days of World War II he was chief of the Latin American Section, Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service. He subsequently entered the United States Marine Corps and was assigned to the O.S.S., serving in Italy and Austria. He joined the staff of the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1946, and in 1955 he became president of that group, and concurrently, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. He also served as an advisor to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations and as a consultant to the U.S. Air Force, which awarded him the Exceptional Service Award in 1956. He was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and of the Educational Testing Service and a director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. He served as chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Panel on Education, and was chief draftsman of that group's widely circulated report, The Pursuit of Excellence. Gardner was the founder of two influential national U.S. organizations: Common Cause and Independent Sector. He authored books on improving leadership in American society and other subjects. He was also the founder of two prestigious fellowship programs, The White House Fellows and The John Gardner Fellowship at Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. In 1966 Gardner was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. Gardner's term as Secretary of HEW was at the height of Johnson's Great Society domestic agenda. During this tenure, the Department undertook both the huge task of launching Medicare, which brought quality health care to senior citizens, and oversaw significant expansions of the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 that redefined the federal role in education and targeted funding to poor students. Gardner resigned as head of HEW because he could not support the war in Vietnam. Gardner was featured on the cover and in an article of the January 20, 1967 Time magazine, and later that year also presided over the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He served on the Stanford University Board of Trustees from 1968 to 1982. On August 18, 1970, Gardner created Common Cause. In 1970, he also founded the Experience Corps.History of Experience Corps In 1973, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1980-1983 he co-founded Independent Sector, which lobbies and does PR on behalf of tax-exempt organizations in order to retain the charitable deduction. In September 2000, Gardner lent his name and support to the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities at Stanford University, a center that partners with communities to develop leadership, conduct research, and effect change to improve the lives of youth. Gardner died of cancer in San Francisco on February 16, 2002. He was buried in San Francisco National Cemetery.  Publications and speeches  * Excellence: Can We Be Equal and Excellent Too?

The fellowship encourages highly motivated graduating seniors to pursue careers in public and community service. Three fellows from each university are chosen annually and provided with placement assistance, a $27,500 stipend, and a senior mentor in their placement organization. Past placements have included the White House, the United States Department of State, and various nonprofit organizations. Initial funding for the fellowship was provided by the Walter and Elise Haas Fund, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Educational Foundation of America, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Millennium Fund, and Michael Walsh. Over time, additional supporters have contributed to the program. The John Gardner Fellowship Association is an association of John Gardner Fellowship alumni from both Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, whose mission is to carry on Gardner's legacy of public service and ensure that the Fellowship programs at both schools have adequate resources for success. Notable former fellows include Gary Rosen, editor of The Wall Street Journal's Weekend Review (1988-1989), Rachel Maddow (1994‚Äì1995), and Heather Podesta (1993‚Äì1994).

Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of mass media (largely television and direct mail), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from opposition research and voter polling, to field strategy and get out the vote efforts. Origins President William McKinley's closest political adviser Mark Hanna is sometimes described as the first political consultant. Whitaker and Baxter established the first true political consulting firm, Campaigns, Inc., which focused exclusively on political campaigns in California in the 1930s - 1950s. However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of television advertising for campaign communications in the 1960s. Joseph Napolitan was the first person to describe himself as a political consultant; The New York Times newspaper described him in a 1968 profile as \\"that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager\\" and a \\"pioneering campaign consultant\\". In recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for parties and political action committees, while some focus on public relations and research work. Many consultants also take up official positions inside Governments while working for a ruling party candidate. Nature of the work Political consultants sometimes act as political strategists, a senior political consultant who promote the election of certain candidates or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign strategies, coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes. Political consultants act as public relations specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of marketing-suitable media, including advertising and press releases, the general goal of political consultants is to make voters aware of their candidates' party platform. As political consulting has expanded worldwide, journalists have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations. Well-known American political consultants such as James Carville, Joseph Napolitan and David H. Sayers, have traveled to other continents, acting as consultants on several political campaigns and advising heads of state. For example, Napolitan acted as a consultant of French President V√°lery Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, several Venezuelan presidents, and Costa Rica‚Äôs √ìscar Arias S√°nchez, and Dick Morris \\"has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of Fernando de la Rua for President of Argentina, Jorge Batlle for President of Uruguay, Vicente Fox for President of Mexico, and Raphael Trotman for President of Guyana.\\" Many Latin American political consultants have also led political campaigns outside of their native countries. One such example is Brazilian political consultant Jo√£o Santana, who simultaneously led three winning presidential campaigns in Latin America: Danilo Medina, in the Dominican Republic; Hugo Ch√°vez, in Venezuela; and Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, in Angola, in the African continent. Venezuelan political strategist JJ Rendon (who lives in United States), has also been recognized internationally, having been ranked as one of the top five most prominent Latin American consultants by the U.S.-based publication Campaigns & Elections (Latin American edition) and who was the 2014 winner of The Victory Awards for his work as the lead strategist of successful presidential campaigns of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia (including his reelection campaign in 2014), Porfirio Lobo and Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez in Honduras and Enrique Pe√±a Nieto in Mexico, among others. Jo√£o Santana has been described by the news magazine Veja as \\"capable of mapping out the weaknesses of adversaries with an acupuncturist‚Äôs precision.\\" While Rendon, has been described by Miami New Times as the \\"Latin America's Karl Rove\\".  Criticisms  =Scandals= As political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in spotlight scandals as journalists have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as James Carville and Newt Gingrich, capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional pundits. Such political consultants routinely appear on television news programs, write books and are treated as social media celebrities. Some detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients. Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations. =Criticism= Review for weasel words, if none found, delete this template. Critics of the political consulting industry blame consultants for what they see as problems in the American election system. * Consultant salaries have risen, which has increased the cost of political campaigns. * \\"Critics of consulting's influence on politics say that changes to the campaign landscape have further entrenched certain consultants, regardless of their track records\\". * Political consultants may be opposed to low-budget campaigns of grassroots candidates. * Activist groups charge that political consultants are a major obstacle to participatory democracy and election reform. =Social media in modern campaigns= Social media has dramatically changed the way in which modern political campaigns are run. With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns. For example, in Australia 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to IDEA), around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow‚Ñ¢ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).  Trade organizations  The American Association of Political Consultants is the major trade association for political consultants in the United States, with thousands of members. Like other professional organizations, it propagates a code of ethics and gives out awards. Similar organizations for political consultants exist for many other countries and regions.

He was Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico.Everett M. Rogers, The Fourteenth Paw: Growing up on an Iowa Farm in the 1930s, Singapore: Asian Media Information and Communication Center, 2008, pp. xi-xii.James W. Dearing and Arvind Singhal, \\"Communication of Innovations: A Journey with Ev Rogers,\\" in Arvind Singhal and James W. Dearing (Eds.), Communication of Innovations: A Journey with Ev Rogers, New Delhi, India: Sage, 2006, p. 21. Education and career Rogers was born on his family's Pinehurst Farm in Carroll, Iowa, in 1931. His father loved electromechanical farm innovations, but was highly reluctant to utilize biological‚Äìchemical innovations, so he resisted adopting the new hybrid seed corn, even though it yielded 25% more crop and was resistant to drought. During the Iowa drought of 1936, while the hybrid seed corn stood tall on the neighbor's farm, the crop on the Rogers' farm wilted. Rogers' father was finally convinced.Thomas E. Backer and Arvind Singhal (Eds.), \\"Forum: The Life and Work of Everett Rogers‚ÄîSome Personal Reflections,\\" Journal of Health Communication, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2005, pp. 285-308. Rogers had no plans to attend university until a school teacher drove him and some classmates to Ames to visit Iowa State University. Rogers decided to pursue a degree there. He received a B.S. in Agriculture in 1952. He then served in the Korean War for two years (1952-1954). He returned to Iowa State University to earn a M.S. in 1955 and a Ph.D. in 1957 both in Rural Sociology. Rogers held faculty positions at Ohio State University (1957‚Äì63), Michigan State University (1964-1973), and the University of Michigan (1973-1975). He was the Janet M. Peck Professor of International Communication at Stanford University (1975-1985) and the Walter H. Annenberg Professor and Associate Dean for Doctoral Studies in the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California (1985-1993). As Fulbright Lecturer, Rogers taught the National University of Colombia in Bogot√° (1963-1964) and at the University of Paris in France (1981). He was also Distinguished Visiting Professor at New Mexico State University (1977), Visiting Professor at Ibero- American University in Mexico (1979), Ludwig Erhard Professor at the University of Bayreuth in Germany (1996), Wee Kim Wee Professor (1998) and Nanyang Professor (2000-2001) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and Visiting Professor at Johns Hopkins University (1999-2000). He served as President of the International Communication Association (1980-1981) and Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California (1991-1992).Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin, \\"Dedication: In Honor of Dr. Everett M. Rogers (1931-2004),\\" in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), The Global Intercultural Communication Reader (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, pp. x-xi. In 1993, Rogers moved to the University of New Mexico as Chair of the Department of Communication and Journalism. He had become fond of Albuquerque while he was stationed at an airbase during the Korean War. He helped the UNM launch a doctoral program in communication with a special emphasis on cross-cultural and intercultural contexts.Ronny Adhikarya, \\"A Personal Tribute to Everett Rogers,\\" Media Asia, Vol. 31, No. 3, 2004, p. 123. Rogers suffered from kidney disease and retired from the UNM in the summer of 2004. He died a few months later, survived by his wife, Dr. Corinne Shefner-Rogers, and two sons: David Rogers and Everett King. During his 47-year academic career, Rogers authored more than 30 books and over 500 articles.Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin, \\"Dedication: In Honor of Dr. Everett M. Rogers (1931-2004),\\" in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), The Global Intercultural Communication Reader (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, p. x. Diffusion of innovations The diffusion of innovations according to Rogers. With successive groups of consumers adopting the new technology (shown in blue), its market share (yellow) will eventually reach the saturation level. When the first edition of Diffusion of Innovations was published in 1962, Rogers was an assistant professor of rural sociology at Ohio State University. He was only 31 years old but was becoming a renowned academic figure.Arvind Singhal and Margaret M. Quinlan, \\"Everett M. Rogers and Diffusion of Innovations,\\" in Don W. Stacks and Michael B. Salwen (Eds.), An Integrated Approach to Communication Theory and Research (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routeldge, 2009, p. 432. In the mid-2000s, The Diffusion of Innovations became the second most-cited book in the social sciences. (Arvind Singhal: Introducing Professor Everett M. Rogers, 47th Annual Research Lecturer, University of New Mexico) . The fifth edition (2003, with Nancy Singer Olaguera) addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas. Rogers proposes that adopters of any new innovation or idea can be categorized as innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%), based on the mathematically based Bell curve. These categories, based on standard deviations from the mean of the normal curve, provide a common language for innovation researchers. Each adopter's willingness and ability to adopt an innovation depends on their awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. People can fall into different categories for different innovations‚Äîa farmer might be an early adopter of mechanical innovations, but a late majority adopter of biological innovations or VCRs. When graphed, the rate of adoption formed what came to typify the Diffusion of Innovations model, a logistic curve. The graph shows a cumulative percentage of adopters over time‚Äìslow at the start, more rapid as adoption increases, then levelling off until only a small percentage of laggards have not adopted.Everett M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovation (3rd Ed.), New York, NY: Free Press, 1983. His research and work became widely accepted in communications and technology adoption studies, and also found its way into a variety of other social science studies. Rogers was also able to relate his communications research to practical health problems, including hygiene, family planning, cancer prevention, and drunk driving. Entertainment education In the early 1990s Rogers turned his attention to the field of Entertainment-Education. With funding from Population Communications International, he evaluated a radio drama designed to improve public health in Tanzania called Twende na Wakati (Let's Go With the Times).Peter Clarke, Scott Ratzan, and Muhiuddin Haider, \\"Commentaries,\\" Journal of Health Communication, Vol. 10, No. 4, 2005, pp. 303-308. With Arvind Singhal of Ohio University he co-wrote Entertainment Education: A Communication Strategy for Social Change. To commemorate his contributions to the field, the University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center established the Everett M. Rogers Award for Achievement in Entertainment-Education, which recognizes outstanding practice or research in the field of entertainment education.  Publications  = Books = * Rogers, E. M. (2003).

The seven organs of the Union are in blue, national / intergovernmental elements in orange. Diagram describing the functioning of the European institutions and their interaction with each other and with Member States The institutions of the European Union are the seven principal decision-making bodies of the European Union (EU). They are, as listed in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union: * the European Parliament, * the European Council (of Heads of Government), * the Council of the European Union (of national Ministers, a Council for each area of responsibility), * the European Commission, * the Court of Justice of the European Union, * the European Central Bank and * the Court of Auditors. Institutions are distinct from advisory bodies to the European Union, and agencies of the European Union. History Most EU institutions were created with the establishment of the European Community in 1958. Much change since then has been in the context of shifting the balance of power away from the Council and towards the Parliament. The role of the Commission has often been to mediate between the two or tip the balance. However, the Commission is becoming more accountable to the Parliament: in 1999 it forced the resignation of the Santer Commission and forced a reshuffle of the proposed Barroso Commission in 2004. The development of the institutions, with incremental changes from treaties and agreements, is testament to the evolution of the Union's structures without one clear \\"master plan\\". Some such as Tom Reid of the Washington Post said of the institutions that \\"nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU\\". =Under the Treaty of Paris= The first institutions were created at the start of the 1950s with the creation of the ECSC, based on the Schuman declaration, between six states. The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of coal and steel, the materials needed to wage war, under the control of a supranational authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development. It established the first institutions. At its core was an independent executive called the \\"High Authority\\" with supranational powers over the Community. The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate. During the negotiations, two supervisory institutions were put forward to counterbalance the power of the High Authority. The \\"Common Assembly\\" proposed by Jean Monnet to act as a monitor, counterweight and to add democratic legitimacy was composed of 78 national parliamentarians. The second was the Council of Ministers, pushed by the smaller states also to add an intergovernmental element and harmonise national policies with those of the authority. =Establishment and changes= In 1957 the Treaties of Rome established two similar communities, creating a common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however, they had a separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The reason for this is the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranational and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive. The three communities were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried over from the European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However, this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it a key role in the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles. The 2009 Lisbon Treaty brought nearly all policy areas (including the budget) under the co-decision procedure (renamed \\"ordinary legislative procedure\\"), hence increasing the power of the Parliament. The rules for the distribution of seats in the parliament were also changed to a formula system. The High Representative merged with the European Commissioner for External Relations and joined the Commission. The appointment of the Commission President became dependent upon the last EU elections. The Council of Ministers adopted more qualified majority voting and the European Council was made a distinct institution with a permanent president. The Court of Justice had some minor renaming and adjustments. In addition, the central bank became a full institution. Overview List There are three political institutions which hold the executive and legislative power of the Union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although the exact nature of this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. =European Parliament= The European Parliament (EP) shares the legislative and budgetary authority of the Union with the Council of the European Union (of relevant national government ministers). Its 751 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. They represent nearly 500 million citizens (the world's second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas, and does not have legislative initiative. It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. It has been said that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world. The Parliament's President (its speaker) is David Sassoli (S&D;), who was elected from the Parliament's members in 2019. =European Council= The European Council is the group of heads of state or government of the EU member states. It meets four times a year to define the Union's policy agenda and give impetus to integration. The President of the European Council is the person responsible for chairing and driving forward the work of the institution, which has been described as the highest political body of the European Union. The current president is Charles Michel (since 1 December 2019). =Council of the European Union= The Council of the European Union (informally known as the Council of Ministers or just the Council) is a body holding legislative and some limited executive powers and is thus the main decision-making body of the Union. Its Presidency rotates between the states every six months, but every three Presidencies now cooperate on a common programme. This body is separate from the European Council, which is a similar body, but is composed of national leaders. The Council is composed of twenty- seven national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The presidency has been held by Germany since July 2020.Presidency of the Council of the European Union =European Commission= The European Commission (EC) is the executive arm of the Union. It is a body composed of one appointee from each state, currently twenty- seven, but is designed to be independent of national interests. The body is responsible for drafting all law of the European Union and has the ability to propose new laws (bills).The Lisbon Treaty gives the European Parliament and the member states the right to ask the Commission to submit bills, and NGOs and other organisations do so also; only 10% of all legislative proposals come only from the Commission. It also deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and has the duty of upholding the law and treaties (in this role it is known as the \\"Guardian of the Treaties\\"). The Commission is led by a President who is nominated by the Council (in practice the European Council) and approved by Parliament. The remaining 26 Commissioners are nominated by member states, in consultation with the President, and have their portfolios assigned by the President. The Council then adopts this list of nominee-Commissioners. The Council's adoption of the Commission is not an area which requires the decision to be unanimous; their acceptance is arrived at according to the rules for qualified majority voting. The European Parliament then interviews and casts its vote upon the Commissioners. The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately, in contrast to Parliament's vote of approval which must be cast on the Commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners. Once approval has been obtained from the Parliament, the Commissioners can take office. The current President is Ursula von der Leyen (EPP); her commission was elected in 2019. =Court of Justice of the European Union= The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the EU's judicial branch. It is responsible for interpreting EU law and treaties. It comprises the main chamber: Court of Justice, the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal. The CJEU is located in Luxembourg. =European Central Bank= European Central Bank headquarters until 2014 The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central bank for the eurozone (the states which have adopted the euro) and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks which comprises all EU national banks. The bank is governed by a board of national bank governors and a President. The ECB is located in Frankfurt. The current president is Christine Lagarde. =European Court of Auditors= The European Court of Auditors (ECA), despite its name, has no judicial powers. It ensures that taxpayer funds from the budget of the European Union have been correctly spent. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. The Court of Auditors was set up in 1975. It was created as an independent institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, OLAF, is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected as the president of the court, who is currently Klaus-Heiner Lehne.Klaus-Heiner Lehne Acts and procedures The codecision procedure is most common, and means the Council and Parliament jointly consider law proposals from the Commission There are a number of types of legislation which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations. The ordinary legislative procedure is used in nearly all policy areas and provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \\"common position\\". That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a \\"Conciliation Committee\\" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority. There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament. Comparisons The EU's institution bears a resemblance to the Swiss government While the EU's system of governance is largely unique, elements can be compared to other models. One general observation on the nature of the distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision-making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision-making. The EU's institutional set up is also somewhat similar to the government of Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion similar to that of the EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital. The European Parliament The European Parliament is better compared with the U. S. House of Representatives than with the national parliaments. Furthermore, executive power in the EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with the division of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former. The nature of the European Parliament is better compared with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable in terms of the committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals. The Council and the German Bundesrat, are both composed by representatives of the states governments The composition of the council can only be compared with the quite unique and unusual composition of the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments in the same manner as the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference of executives in the legislative process. Locations The institutions are not concentrated in a single capital city; instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities: Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts in Luxembourg City, and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg City, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat in Luxembourg City. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt, while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere). Brussels' hosting of institutions has made it a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington, D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament, due to the large number of people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200 million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.

Some NATO-approved munitions suppliers such as Mecar have continued to use Composition B in their products. Composition B is related to Cyclotol, which has a higher proportion of RDX (up to 75%).

All can be moulded by hand for use in demolition work and packed by hand into shaped charge devices. Variants have different proportions and plasticisers and include composition C-2, composition C-3, and composition C-4. History The term composition is used for any explosive material compounded from several ingredients. In particular, in the 1940s the format \\"Composition \\" was used for various compositions of the (relatively) novel explosive RDX, such as Composition B and other variants. Development The original material was developed by the British during World War II, and was used in the Gammon bomb. It was standardised as Composition C when introduced to US service. This material consisted of 88.3% RDX and a mineral oil-based plasticiser and phlegmatiser. It suffered from a relatively limited range of serviceable temperatures, and was replaced by Composition C-2 around 1943. =Composition = Composition C-1 contained a slightly smaller proportion of RDX, but used an explosive plasticiser, which contained tetryl, nitrocellulose and a mixture of nitroaromatics produced during the manufacture of TNT (containing trinitrotoluene, dinitrotoluene and mononitrotoluene), and a trace of solvent. Characteristics and Usage Composition C-3 was very similar to Composition C-1, but removed the solvent and varied the exact proportions of plasticisers to improve high temperature storage. It is a yellow, putty-like material. It remained a service item through the Korean War, but had marginal plasticity at the very low temperatures encountered in Korean winters, and was significantly toxic, including by vapour and skin absorption. While Composition C-3 had a much wider serviceable temperature range than Composition C, it could not be stored at elevated temperatures. Consequently, it was replaced around 1944 by Composition C-4. The velocity of detonation is about 7600 m/s (25,000 feet per second.) Composition C-3 consists of 77%‚Äì85% cyclonite (RDX) and 15%‚Äì23% gel made out of liquid nitro compounds (e.g. liquid DNT and small amount of NT) and nitrocellulose or butyl phthalate and nitrocellulose. One of the first reported and tested compositions of C-3 was very similar to earlier Composition C-2 and contained 77% RDX, 3% tetryl, 4% TNT, 1% NC, 5% NT, and 10% DNT. The last two compounds (they are very poor explosives) are oily liquids and plasticise the mixture. The most important later innovation of C-3 introduced the non-explosive plasticiser butyl phthalate instead of this mixture of nitro compounds. This reduced the toxicity while increasing the concentration of RDX and improving safety of use and storage. It also opened the way to begin study of new non-explosive low-toxicity plasticisers (esters of dicarboxylic acid) and binder (branched polymers). Discovery Research on a replacement for C-2 was begun prior to 1950, but the new material, new generation of Composition C (number four, C-4), did not begin pilot production until 1956. Properties Since 1960 the mixture of C-3 has contained: * 90.0‚Äì91.0% of cyclonite (RDX explosives) * ~2.1% of polyisobutylene (short chain) * ~1.6% of motor oil * ~5.3% of di-(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (dioctyl sebacate), sometimes it was replaced partly by similar compounds such as dioctyl adipate * less than 0.6% of water * (small amount of marker or odorising taggant) It is less volatile than C-4 and has less tendency to harden at low temperature. It has a density 1.48‚Äì1.60g/ml, does not become hard even at ‚àí55 ¬∞C (‚àí67 ¬∞F), and does not exude at +77 ¬∞C (171 ¬∞F). C4 has a detonation velocity of 8092 m/s (26550 ft/s) at high density and velocity of 7550 m/s (24770 ft/s) at low density 1.48 g/ml. It is so successful that it remains in army service up to the current time without any significant changes.

It is located at its central axis, behind the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Built above three levels of marble stone base, and surrounded by bronze incense burners, the Hall of Supreme Harmony is one of the largest wooden structures within China. It was the location where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties hosted their enthronement and wedding ceremonies. The name of the Hall was changed several times throughout the past few centuries, from its initial Fengtian Dian (Â•âÂ§©ÊÆø), later to Huangji Dian (ÁöáÊûÅÊÆø) in 1562 and to the current one by the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in 1645. Together with the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony, the three halls constitute the heart of the Outer Court of the Forbidden City. The Hall of Supreme Harmony rises some 30 meters above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial center of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is eleven bays wide - with the main room being nine bays wide - and five bays deep, the numbers nine and five being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. The six pillars nearest the imperial throne are covered with gold, and the entire area is decorated with a dragon motif. The Dragon Throne, in particular, has five dragons coiled around the back and handrests. The screen behind it features sets of nine dragons, again reflecting the \\"nine- five\\" symbolism.p 67, The Hall of Supreme Harmony features an exquisite throne made of red sandalwood, and formerly used by the emperors of the Qing dynasty. Set into the ceiling directly above the throne is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the \\"Xuanyuan Mirror\\", a reference to the Yellow Emperor, a mythological Chinese ruler.p 253, Yu (1984) According to legend, the metal balls will fall and strike dead any usurper to the throne. The Hall of Supreme Harmony In the Ming dynasty, the emperors held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, emperors held court far more frequently. As a result, the location was changed to the Inner Court, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as enthronements, investitures, and imperial weddings. The original hall was built in 1406 during the Ming dynasty, destroyed seven times by fires during the Qing dynasty, and rebuilt for the last time in 1695‚Äì1697. After a reconstruction in the 16th century, the dimensions of the hall were reduced from around 95m by 48m to its present measurements, 64m by 37m. Inability to find sufficiently large logs was cited as the cause for this change.

Until 2015, the board reported to the Minister of Consumer Services but as of 1 October 2015, the board was overseen by the Ontario Film Authority. The board's activities were based on the Film Classification Act, 2005. The Ontario Film Review Board ceased operation as of October 1, 2019, with responsibility for film classification being transferred from the Ontario Film Authority, which is to be wound down, and the Ontario Film Review Board to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. For the time being, films will be deemed to have the same classification as those given by British Columbia Film Classification Office and adult films will be cleared for screening in Ontario if they have been approved by any jurisdiction in Canada.https://www.ontariofilmauthority.ca/web/app/pdfs/en/Notices/838_ADM%20M%20Sanborn%20Memo_OFA%20Industry%20Notice%20September%2027%202019_English%20-%20Final.pdf https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/ontario-s-film-ratings-board-to-be- shuttered-by-ford-government-1.23960199 History A three-person Board of Censors was established on 27 June 1911 following passage of the Theatres and Cinematographs Act, 1911. The initial members were Chair George E. Armstrong, Robert Wilson and Otter Elliott. From that point, films to be shown in Ontario legally required review and approval by the board. The Board's censorship authority included newsreels, for example footage from a 1937 General Motors strike was banned \\"to avoid propaganda by either side.\\" The Board of Censors began to provide basic film classifications from 1 June 1946, initially as a year-long pilot project to designate certain films which were deemed inappropriate for children. Theatre operators were required to identify such films as \\"adult entertainment\\" on marquees and advertising. The Blue Dahlia and Her Kind of Man were among the first films to be identified as adult entertainment in Ontario. Further changes to the Theatres Act in 1975 empowered what was now known as the Ontario Censor Board to review and censor videotapes and 8 mm film formats as well as conventional theatrical films. In the late 1970s and early 80s the Board was involved in a number of high- profile disputes with the Toronto International Film Festival (known then as the Festival of Festivals) over the Board's refusal to approve some films for screening without cuts, and for banning other films outright. In 1977, the board ordered cuts from the film Je, tu, il, elle which depicted two women having sex; the Festival pulled the film from its programme. In 1978, it demanded a 38-second cut from a love scene in In Praise of Older Women; director Robert Lantos agreed but at the last minute substituted the uncut version of the film. The screening was introduced by federal Secretary of State for Canada John Roberts who publicly denounced the board, telling the audience at the Elgin Theatre that ‚Äúbecause of the actions of the Ontario censor it is time for an active affirmation that censors shouldn‚Äôt tell people what they should or should not see.‚Äù In 1982, the board refused to approve Pierre Rissient‚Äôs Cinq et la peau; instead of substituting another film, festival organizers protested the ban by posting a sign outside the theatre explaining why the screen was being kept dark. The board's high profile actions against various films being screened at the festival had the unintended effect of raising their profile and audience interest. According to former festival director Helga Stephenson, ‚ÄúSilly old [Ontario Censor Board chairman] Mary Brown filled some theatres with some pretty tame stuff. The ranting and raving was a very good way to get the festival into the minds of the public, but internationally it was hugely embarrassing. And it filled the theatre with the wrong people, because they came looking for nothing but blow jobs, and they found themselves in the middle of a long, hard, boring film waiting for a few seconds of a grainy image showing something that looked vaguely like a male sex organ.‚Äùhttp://torontoist.com/2013/09/censoring-the- toronto-international-film-festival/ In 1985, the name of the board was changed to the Ontario Film Review Board after the provincial government amended the Theatres Act. The Board composition changed from full-time civil servants to part-time members of the public. In 1988 festival films became exempt from review by the board provided the audience was limited to those eighteen and over.http://covell.ca/ontario-film-review-board-vs-toronto-film- festival/ In 2005 the original and much amended Theatres Act was replaced by the Film Classification Act In 2013 the Ontario Film Authority was incorporated. It entered into an agreement with the Minister of Consumer Services dated 5 May 2014. On 1 October 2015, an amendment to Ontario Regulation 187/09 came into effect, providing that the Ontario Film Authority is the sole administrative authority for the purpose of administering all provisions of the Film Classification Act, 2005 and the regulations made under that Act.Section 2.1 of O. Reg. 187/09, as amended by O. Reg. 208/14 , as amended by O. Reg. 61/15 . This restructuring of administrative oversight in 2015 was \\"part of a larger provincial initiative to streamline more than 200 boards and commissions\\", according to The Toronto Star. =Censored film cases= Significant cases have occurred where a film was either banned outright in Ontario, or certain scenes were ordered removed: * 1926: Moana - the censor board would not approve this film unless 300 feet, or about 4% of the footage, was removed. The depiction of topless Samoan women in the production was cited as the cause for this censorship. The film was defended by artist Arthur Heming and others, while it was approved by film review authorities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. * 1940: The March of Time newsreel episode \\"Canada At War\\" was banned until the 1940 federal election was completed, as Premier Mitchell Hepburn charged that the production was \\"pure political propaganda for the Mackenzie King Government\\". The newsreel was allowed in Quebec where cinemas in Hull, Quebec reported significant audience levels. * 1978: In Praise of Older Women - The Board requested a two-minute cut from this federally funded and Canadian made film, showing as the festival opener at the Toronto Film Festival. The cut was negotiated down to 38 seconds, but most sources claim an uncut version was shown at the festival. The offending scene was simulated sexual activity. * 1978: Pretty Baby - The film was fully banned from Ontario as it depicted a prostitute who was a minor. * 1980: The Tin Drum - Specific scenes were ordered deleted before the film could be shown in Ontario. The director and distributor initially refused to edit the film but eventually agreed to a compromise where the film would be distributed with fewer cuts than originally ordered. * 2000: Baise-moi - This film originally played uncut at the Toronto Film Festival. When it was rated for general release, it was banned due to excessive explicit sexual content. The distributor resubmitted the film for consideration as an adult sex film, but it was banned due to sexual violence. Eventually the film was approved and rated R, after a small cut. * 2001: Fat Girl - The Film Review Board ordered deletion of scenes from most of the film's 93-minute length, effectively banning the production. Scenes of sexuality involving a 13-year-old character were cited. The film's distributors filed an appeal with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, but the Film Review Board reconsidered and passed the film intact for Ontario audiences before the appeal could be heard. Several sources claim the Board banned the NFB anti-pornography documentary Not a Love Story. The Board was asked to rate this film, along with three others, submitted by a group of artists, known as the Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society (OFVAS). The Board refused to view or rate Not a Love Story on the grounds that OFVAS did not own the film or have any distribution rights. Ratings were provided on the other films. The artists then took the Board to court over the ratings given, and the refusal to rate Not a Love Story. The Board's actions were challenged under the new Canadian Constitution. The Ontario Divisional Court ruled in 1983 that film classification and censorship were justifiable under the Constitution. The court also determined that three of the Board's rulings were valid. Approval with time and place restrictions in the case of The Art of Worldly Wisdom and Rameau's Nephew was considered a \\"valid exercise of the Board's power.\\" The Board's refusal to review Not A Love Story: A Film About Pornography was acceptable as the Board did not need to perform hypothetical reviews. The film had not been submitted for commercial distribution, and the judge noted \\"the applicants were seeking permission to show a film they did not own and which they had no right to exhibit.\\" Concerning the Board's ban of the fourth film, Amerika, the court ruled that the Board had no legally defined rights to determine what the public could view. The government appealed to the Ontario Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed in 1984.\\"Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society v. Ontario Board of Censors (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 583, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 58, 34 C.R. (3d) 73 (Div. Ct.); affirmed (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 80, 2 O.A.C. 388, 5 D.L.R. (4th) 766 (C.A.)\\" The government subsequently added regulations to define the Board\`s powers.

Stewart (born January 2, 1950) is a United States federal judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994, Stewart previously sat on the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit in Shreveport. He has been honored multiple times for his commitment to community service. Background Stewart was born to Corine and Richard Stewart, a postal worker, in Shreveport. As a teenager in the 1960s, Stewart witnessed the civil rights movement and saw how the legal system could be used to bring about social change. Inspired, Stewart decided to dedicate his life to helping people through the legal system. He graduated from Dillard University in New Orleans with a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude in 1971 and earned his Juris Doctor from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law in 1974. Career Later in 1974, Stewart entered the United States Army in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. As a captain, he served as a defense attorney for soldiers at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. After an honorable discharge, Stewart worked as an associate in a small private law firm. In 1978, he joined a field office of the state Attorney General William J. Guste. In 1979, Stewart became an Assistant United States Attorney, and worked on a variety of cases. He prosecuted a loan shark who preyed on the poor, a sheriff who paid for votes during a reelection bid, and an unscrupulous land owner who filed false flood relief claims with the federal government. Stewart received a letter of commendation from the Justice Department for his work on a civil rights case in 1982 and 1983. Stewart left the Justice Department in 1983 to go into private practice in Shreveport, and work as an adjunct professor at Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

Chhayavad was marked by a renewed sense of the self and personal expression, visible in the writings of time. It is known for its leaning towards themes of love and nature, as well as an individualistic reappropriation of the Indian tradition in a new form of mysticism, expressed through a subjective voice. Period In, Chhayavad Yug is 1918 to 1937, and is preceded by Bharatendu Yug (1868‚Äì1900), and Dwivedi Yug (1900‚Äì1918), and is in turn, followed by the Contemporary Period, 1937 onwards.Hindi LanguageHistorical Development of Hindi University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign Chhayavad continued till later half of the 1930s, when the golden era of modern Hindi poetry was gradually replaced by social didacticism inspired by the uprising nationalist fervour, when some of the later poets of this era, like Dinkar, Mahadevi and Bachchan took nationalist and social critiquing within their poetry.  Notable authors  Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Sumitranandan Pant and Mahadevi VarmaChhayavaadi Movement are considered as the four pillars of Chhayavaadi school of Hindi literature. Other important figures of this literary movement were Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Makhanlal Chaturvedi and Pandit Narendra Sharma. Though Harivansh Rai Bachchan became excessively critical of Chhayavaad later in his career and was associated with other genres like Rahasyavaad, Pragativaad and Haalaavaad.  Notable works  Jaishankar Prasad's Kamayani (1936) is considered an important magnum opus of this school, followed by Mahadevi Varma's, Nihar (Mist, 1930), Harivansh Rai Bachchan's, Madhushala (1935).  Criticism of Chhayavaad  When it arrived, Chhayavaad was very well received by readers and critics alike. However, subsequent scholars have criticized Chhayavaad for excessive use of decorative language, romanticism aloof from contemporary social and economic malaise and setting stricter rules on meter, rhyme etc. Notes References * Romantic Poetry in the Era of Convention * Chhayavad study in The Journal of the American Oriental Society, Jul 1, 2001 *1 Now available in Vani Prakashan, New Delhi Category:Hindi literary movements Category:Neo-romanticism Category:20th-century Indian literature ","title":"Chhayavaad"},{"id":"1123520","text":"Ahmad FanƒÅkatƒ´ or BanƒÅkatƒ´ (; ; before 1242 ‚Äî 10 April 1282) was a Mongol Muslim from the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) who served as finance minister of the Yuan dynasty during Kublai's reign. He became known as a chief minister under Kublai and is credited with successfully establishing the financial system of the Yuan Empire. He was considered to be a \\"villainous minister\\" in dynastic histories because of his perceived corruption. Life and career Ahmad FanƒÅkatƒ´ came from FanƒÅkat (or BanƒÅkat), a town on the upper Syr Darya in Central Asia, under the rule of the Qara Khitai until they were conquered by the Mongol Empire. Alt URL Ahmad obtained employment under Kublai through Empress Jamui Khatun, who had known him before her marriage. To her court he was originally attached but we find him already in high financial office in 1264. Trusted by Chabi Khatun, Kublai's favorite wife, Ahmad was entrusted with state finances in 1262. He was successful in managing the financial affairs of Northern China and brought huge tax revenues to Kublai's new government. In 1270, he assumed the full power of the new financial department known as the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng), which had equal status with the administrative department known as the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng). After the conquest of the Song dynasty in 1276, he entered the financial matters of Southern China. He prepared a state monopoly in salt, which came to account for a large portion of state income. In his 20-year term of office, he created his strong faction with his clan and Muslims from Central Asia. Ahmad's tax system gained a bad reputation from the Chinese because it was ruthlessly operated and considerably differed from traditional Chinese systems. Ahmad was reputed for his rapaciousness. He abused his position to gather riches for himself. Marco Polo recorded his name as \\"Bailo Acmat (Achmac)\\". He mentions that Ahmad had 25 sons and accumulated great wealth. In 1271, the Department of State Affairs was absorbed into the Central Secretariat. While holding the financial affairs, he started intervening in state administration. It heightened tension with the rival faction that included Crown Prince Zhenjin, Antong, the head of the Central Secretariat and other Mongol aristocrats, and Chinese bureaucrats. The death of his political patron Chabi Khatun in 1281 made the situation critical; Ahmad was assassinated by Wang Zhu and Gao Heshang (Kao Ho-chang) in the next year and his faction fell from power. Although Ahmad's assassins were executed, after Kublai Khan heard all the complaints about Ahmad's corruption from his enemies, Kublai then ordered Ahmad's body to be taken from his tomb and desecrated by being eaten by dogs, and then using chariot wheels to smash the bones to pieces. Kublai also ordered Ahmad's sons to be put to death. Influence Ahmad is usually portrayed as an evil bureaucrat in traditional Chinese records: his corruption and tyranny are emphasized. In contrast, the Jami al-Tawarikh positively evaluates his assistance to Kublai's administration. The recent Mongolian studies also tend to make positive reference to his role in establishing the dynasty's unique financial system. In popular culture Ahmad Fanakati was fictionalized by Mahesh Jadu in the Netflix series Marco Polo and by Leonard Nimoy in the RAI mini-series Marco Polo during the 1980s. In the Netflix series Marco Polo, Ahmad declares that he is not Persian but rather that he hails from Upper Asia. Specifically, he mentions a village near Bukhara that was destroyed as he was taken into the Mongol court. He is described and holds an influential role in the Jami al- Tawarikh, furthermore Akmad plays the treacherous villain and lead antagonist in Season 2 of the Marco Polo.

BBS in 1998. Shift_JIS art is artwork created from characters within the Shift JIS character set, a Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) superset of JIS X 0201 (in turn almost a superset of ASCII) intended for Japanese usage. Naturally there are many similarities between Shift_JIS artwork and ASCII art. Shift_JIS has become very popular on web-based bulletin boards, notably 2channel, and has even made its way into mainstream media and commercial advertising in Japan. Within the Japanese community, Shift_JIS art is sometimes abbreviated as SJIS art, but is most commonly referred to as \\"AA\\" meaning ASCII art, although it rarely restricts itself to the 95 printable characters within the ASCII standard. As with ANSI art, SJIS art is sometimes used for animation. However, due to technical advances, SJIS art also appears in the form of Adobe Flash files and animated GIFs. Unlike Western ASCII art, which is generally designed to be viewed with a monospaced font, Shift_JIS art is designed around the proportional-width MS PGothic font supplied with Microsoft Windows, which is the default font for web sites in Japanese versions of Windows. This dependency has led to the development of the free Mona Font, in which each character is the same width as its counterpart in MS PGothic. This is useful on operating systems lacking the PGothic font, such as Linux.  In Japanese media  The Japanese movie and television show, , frequently included Shift_JIS art, both during screen transitions and within the story itself. One of the recurring characters in the TV series was a Shift_JIS artist who would often draw full-screen Shift_JIS works of art as a way of expressing his support and encouraging the lead character. When they got engaged, posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple, and extravagant Shift JIS art pictures were posted. The Touhou Project meme \\"Yukkuri shite itte ne!\\" comes from a Shift_JIS attempt to draw the lead characters of Touhou, Reimu and Marisa.

Biography Momigliano was born on 5 September 1908 in Caraglio, Piedmont. In 1936 he became Professor of Roman History at the University of Turin, but as a Jew soon lost his position due to the anti-Jewish Racial Laws enacted by the Fascist regime in 1938, and moved to England, where he remained. After a time at Oxford University, he went to University College London, where he was Professor from 1951 to 1975. He was a Fellow of the Warburg Institute and supervised the PhD of Wolf Liebeschuetz. Momigliano visited regularly at the University of Chicago where he was named Alexander White Professor in the Humanities, and at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He wrote reviews for The New York Review of Books. In addition to studying the ancient Greek historians and their methods, he also took an interest in modern historians, such as Edward Gibbon, and wrote a number of studies of them. After 1930, Momigliano contributed a number of biographies to the Enciclopedia Italiana; in the 1940s and 1950s he contributed biographies to the Oxford Classical Dictionary and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1974 he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). A number of his essays were collected into volumes published posthumously. He died on 1 September 1987 in London. Views In the 1930s, Momigliano joined the National Fascist Party, swore loyalty to Benito Mussolini, and sought exemption from antisemitic Italian Racial Laws as a party member. Momigliano believed that several classical works of European literature had contributed to the nationalism and warfare in Europe, and considered works such as Germania and the Iliad as \\"among the most dangerous books ever written\\".Anthony Birley, ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô, in Tacitus, Agricola and Germany (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. xxxviii. Momigliano considered it wasteful and \\"comical\\" to spend much efforts at identifying and explaining the forces held responsible for the gradual disintegration of the Roman Empire.\\"After Gibbon's Decline and Fall\\", in The Age of Spirituality: a Symposium, (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; Princeton University Press, 1980), 7‚Äì16, at 14. \\"Historians, one must admit, were not created by God to search for causes.

But we must have a mental picture, a model of the whole situation as a term of reference, and here, I submit, is where Gibbon helps us.\\" In the 1980s, Momigliano and fellow historian Carlo Ginzburg leveled heavy criticism against French philologist Georges Dum√©zil, whom they charged with being a fascist opposed to \\"Judeo-Christian\\" society. Momigliano's attacks on Dum√©zil, who was then in very poor health, have been described as \\"unfair and vicious\\" by Edgar C. Polom√©.

Altmann, 541 U.S. 677 (2004), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, or FSIA, applies retroactively.. It is one of the most recent cases that deals with the \\"anti-retroactivity doctrine\\", which is a doctrine that holds that courts should not construe a statute to apply retroactively (to apply to situations that arose before it was enacted) unless there is a clear statutory intent that it should do so. This means that, regarding lawsuits filed after its enactment, the FSIA standards of sovereign immunity and its exceptions apply even to conduct that took place before 1976. Since the FSIA is only a codification of existing well settled international law, Austria was deemed not immune from litigation. The result of this case for the plaintiff, Maria Altmann, was that she was authorized to proceed with a civil action against Austria in a U.S. federal district court for recovery of five paintings stolen by the Nazis from her relatives and then housed in an Austrian government museum. As the Supreme Court noted in its decision, Altmann had already tried suing the museum before in Austria, but was forced to voluntarily dismiss her case because of Austria's rule that court costs are proportional to the amount in controversy (in this case, the enormous monetary value of the paintings). Under Austrian law, the filing fee for such a lawsuit is determined as a percentage of the recoverable amount. At the time, the five paintings were estimated to be worth approximately US$135 million, making the filing fee over US$1.5 million. Although the Austrian courts later reduced this amount to $350,000, this was still too much for Altmann, and she dropped her case in the Austrian court system. The high court remanded the case for trial in the Los Angeles district court. Back in the district court, both parties agreed to non-binding arbitration in Austria in 2005, which in turn ruled in favor of Altmann on 16 January 2006. Case Adele Bloch-Bauer, the subject of two of the paintings, had written in her last will: \\"Meine 2 Portr√§ts und 4 Landschaften von Gustav Klimt, bitte ich meinen Ehegatten nach seinem Tode der √∂sterr. Staats-Galerie in Wien zu hinterlassen\\"; that is, \\"I ask my husband to bequeath my 2 portraits and the 4 landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna after his death.\\" Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer signed a statement acknowledging Adele's wish in her last will. He also donated one of the paintings to the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna in 1936.http://www.adele.at/Klage_von__Dr__Stefan_Gulner_m/Vorgelegte_Urkunden/Testament_vom_19_1_1923_von_Ad/testament_vom_19_1_1923_von_ad.html The Austrian Supreme Court determined that Adele was probably never the legal owner of the paintings. Rather, it viewed it as more likely that Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer was their legal owner and that in turn Altmann was the rightful heir of Ferdinand's estate. Poster in Vienna, bidding goodbye to the painting Adele Bloch-Bauer. Aftermath = Reactions and auction = The ruling in favor of Maria Altmann came as a great shock to the Austrian public and the government. The loss of the paintings was regarded in Austria as a loss of national treasure. She had attempted earlier to come to some mutual agreement in 1999; however, the government repeatedly ignored her proposals. Maria Altmann told the government that the time was up and there would be no deal from her side anymore. The Austrian government declined to accept a condition of the arbitration which would have allowed it preferentially to purchase the paintings at an attested market price. The paintings left Austria in March 2006 and were returned to Altmann. Consequently, the Austrian government received criticism from the opposition parties for its failure to secure a deal with Altmann at an earlier stage. The city of Vienna also asserted that repossessing the paintings was a \\"moral duty\\". Just months after the Austrian government finally returned Ms. Altmann's family's heirlooms to her, she consigned the Klimts to the auction house Christie's, to be sold on her behalf. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I sold for allegedly $135 million in a private sale, the others in auction, e.g. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II for $88 million, with the five paintings fetching a total of over $327 million.Christopher Michaud, Christie's stages record art sale, Reuter's, November 9, 2006.

She was designated a National Historic Landmark for her service in World War II, for which she earned four battle stars. She presently serves as a museum ship at the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. World War II Becuna (SS-319) was launched 30 January 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. George C. Crawford, and commissioned on 27 May 1944. Becuna departed New London 1 July 1944 and arrived at Pearl Harbor 29 July. Her war operations extended from 23 August 1944 to 27 July 1945. During this period she completed five war patrols in the Philippines, South China Sea, and the Java Sea. Becuna is credited with having sunk two Japanese tankers totaling 3,888 tons. The submarine arrived at Subic Bay, Luzon, from her last war patrol 27 July 1945. In September 1945 she arrived at San Diego. Becuna received four battle stars for her World War II service. Post-war service After World War II Becuna continued to operate with Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, until April 1949 when she was ordered to Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 8. Between May 1949 and May 1950 she conducted refresher training exercises and also assisted in training of student officers and men at New London, Connecticut. In November 1950 she returned to Electric Boat Co., for a complete modernization overhaul, being refitted as a GUPPY-type submarine. The overhaul was completed in August 1951, and Becuna sailed to the Caribbean for shakedown. She returned to New London in September 1951. Becuna operated with the Atlantic Fleet, making two cruises with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and one to Scotland. Other than these extended cruises, the majority of Becunas service was at New London as a training submarine. In 1969, she was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-319. Museum ship Becuna in Philadelphia. Note the difference in her appearance after her extensive modernization in 1951. Becuna was decommissioned on 7 November 1969, and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She reverted to SS-319 in 1971. She was stricken from the Naval Register on 15 August 1973. Becuna was placed on permanent display adjacent to the cruiser at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia on 21 June 1976. Since 1996 both vessels have been operated by the Independence Seaport Museum. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 2001, Becuna received the Historical Welded Structure Award of the American Welding Society.

At the peak of its popularity in the 1970s, the chain had 100 locations in the United States. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 1986. The last remaining restaurant in the former chain was located in Salem, Massachusetts until it abruptly closed in December 2017. The restaurant chain continues in Malaysia. History The concept evolved from a Cornell University School of Hotel Administration graduate project, according to original owners Bob Freeman, Peter Lee, and Dick Bradley, all 1963 graduates of the school. The first location was opened in San Francisco in December 1969 and was a 158-seat restaurant located on the Embarcadero at Broadway that was constructed out of five boxcars and two cabooses around a central lobby-service area. Another source incorrectly claimed an April 1969 opening date. The restaurant was grossing $90,000 monthly during its first year of operations. By the end of 1978, Victoria Station had 97 restaurants, all company owned. The chain was designed to attract members of the baby boom generation. The theme of the restaurant was loosely based on London's Victoria Station. Antique English railway artifacts were used as decor inside, and the exteriors were composed of American Railway cars, primarily boxcars, with a signature Caboose placed in front. On the \\"entry platform\\" to each restaurant was a London-style phone booth. Prime rib was the featured item on a limited menu that included steaks, barbecued beef ribs, and shrimp done in a variation of scampi style known as \\"Shrimp Victoria\\". Most of the restaurants used authentic railway cars for dining areas, often boxcars or cabooses. The Victoria Station chain flourished in the 1970s, according to a memoir by former Victoria Station corporate marketing manager Tom Blake. The company was among the first restaurant companies to offer its employees stock options and an ESOP program. The peak of success of the Victoria Station restaurant chain took place at the time of the culmination of a joint venture with Universal Studios, which resulted in the opening of Victoria Station Universal City, a location on the \\"hill\\" near where Citywalk now stands. At its peak, the Universal City location of Victoria Station was among the highest grossing restaurants in the United States. The U.S. operations of the Victoria Station chain began running into financial difficulties in the mid-1980s, causing gradual shutdowns of the franchise restaurants. In May 1986, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. bankruptcy court. Eight months later, it was reported in January 1987 that the company had a restructuring plan in place that would require it to sell a number of restaurants. A new company, called Victoria Station Acquisition Corporation and was controlled by Lowell Farkas, purchased the Victoria Station trademark and 11 of the restaurants for $6.5 million and the assumption of a $1 million tax liability. There was a similar chain called \\"Twickenham Station\\" in Alabama and Florida during the same time span. They were not connected. (Huntsville AL,Montgomery AL,Mobile AL, Pensacola FL) Promotions Singer Johnny Cash produced for the chain a promotional album of train songs, entitled Destination Victoria Station, which was then sold in the restaurants. This included the title song of the same name written and performed by Cash specifically for the album. The chain was a sponsor of the United States Ski Team at least from 1977 to 1979Skiing Magazine, November 1977, p. 83; Ski Magazine, March 1978, p. 86; Skiing Magazine, November 1979, p. 88.

Dorotheus of Gaza ( Dorotheos tes Gazes; 505 ‚Äì 565 or 620,) or Abba Dorotheus, was a Christian monk and abbot. He joined the monastery Abba Serid (or Abba Sveridus) near Gaza through the influence of elders Barsanuphius and John. Around 540 he founded his own monastery nearby and became abbot there. It was to the monks of this monastery that he addressed his instructions/teaching (, \\"ascetics\\") of which a considerable number have survived and have been compiled into Directions on Spiritual Training, originally composed in Greek and translated in medieval Syriac, Arabic, Georgian, and Church Slavonic.Abba Dorotheus. Ascetic Writings. Introduction, text, translation, comments and tables (in Greek). Editor Holy Monastery of St. John the Forerunner, Careas - Athens 1983. It is typical that at the heading of his teachings he announces that he offers his teaching \\"following the death of Abba John the Prophet and the complete silence of Abba Barsanuphius\\". It seems that as long his holy spiritual fathers lived he thought that he should live in obedience, keep silent and not give his own teaching. Only after the demise of one and the decision of the other not to speak did he decide to record his ascetic experiences, in order to edify the monks at the new monastery. He presents his teaching looking to one sole aim, the edification of those to whom it is addressed. He is not interested in elegance of expression or style. Thus, his words are uncontrived, clear and simple. A careful study of the teachings of Abba Dorotheus shows a strict logical structure in an intelligible and analytic manner. The matters are not approached in a theoretical way, but on the basis of everyday reality and on his monastic experience. He primarily links his teaching with the Holy Scripture and often introduces the subjects by starting from a biblical quote or passage, mainly from the Old Testament. Furthermore, he uses biblical citations from both the Old and New Testament throughout the development of his thought. In his practical teaching, Abba Dorotheus does not ignore the theology of the Church. In his thought, theology and the practical- ascetic life coexist. He certainly is not interested in giving some doctrinal teaching. Nevertheless, his practical teaching is saturated by the faith of the Church.See Constantine B. Scouteris, Abba Dorotheos. Practical Teaching on the Christian Life (Translation, Introduction and Glossary), Athens 2000 (pp. 374), pp. 30-39 ().

June 18 (June 5 old style) in Churches of Eastern Orthodox tradition and August 13 in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\\"–ü—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–π –ê–≤–≤–∞ –î–æ—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ–π\\", Russian Orthodox Church Calendar, \\"Pravoslavie.RU\\" (in Russian) - August 13 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics) Some instructions of Abba Dorotheus * God's providence. Do not wish for everything to be done according to your determination, but wish that it is how it should be, and in this way, you will attain peace with everyone. And believe that everything that happens to us, even the most insignificant, occurs through God's Providence. Then you will be able to endure everything that comes upon you without any agitation. * Yearning toward goodness. 11\\\\. Everyone that desires salvation must not only avoid evil, but is obliged to do good, just as it says in the Psalm: \\"Depart from evil and do good\\" (Psalm 34:14). For example, if somebody was angry, he must not only not get angry, but also become meek; if somebody was proud, he must not only refrain from being proud but also become humble. Thus, every passion has an opposing virtue: pride ‚Äî humility, stinginess ‚Äî charity, lust ‚Äî chastity, faintheartedness ‚Äî patience, anger ‚Äî meekness, hatred ‚Äî love. * Struggles with deficiencies. 21\\\\. Who resembles a person who satisfies his passions? He is like a person who, after being struck down with his enemy's arrows, then takes them with his hands and pierces his own heart with them. He who opposes passions is like a person that is showered with his enemy's arrows, but remains untouched because he is dressed in steel. One who has eradicated his passions, is like a person that although under a torrent of arrows, either shatters them or returns them into the hearts of his enemies ‚Äî just as the Psalm states: \\"Their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken\\" (Psalm 37:15). * Guarding the conscience. 23\\\\. When God created man, He planted something divine into him ‚Äî a certain conception ‚Äî a spark that has both light and warmth. The conception that enlightens the mind and indicates what is right and what is wrong is called conscience. Conscience is a natural law. Living in times before any written law, patriarchs and saints pleased God by following the voice of their conscience. * Temperance, meekness. 24\\\\. Not only should we observe moderation with food, but we must also abstain from every other sin so that just as we fast with our stomach, we should fast with our tongue. Likewise, we should fast with our eyes i.e. not look at agitating things, not allow your eyes freedom to roam, not to look shamelessly and without fear. Similarly, arms and legs should be restrained from doing any evil acts. 27\\\\. It is impossible for anyone to get angry with his neighbor without initially raising himself above him, belittling him and then regarding himself higher than the neighbor. * Sorrows and God's Providence. 24\\\\. When we suffer something unpleasant from our best friend, we know that he did not do it intentionally and that he loves us. We must think likewise of God, Who created us, for our sake incarnated, and died for our sake having endured enormous suffering. We must remind ourselves that He does everything from His goodness and from His love for us. We may think that while our friend loves us, in not having sufficient good sense in order to do everything correctly, he therefore involuntarily hurt us. This cannot be said of God because He is the highest wisdom. He knows what is good for us and accordingly, directs everything for our benefit, even in the smallest things. It can also be said that although our friend loves us and is sufficiently sensible, he is powerless to help us. But this certainly cannot be said of God, because to Him everything is possible and nothing is difficult for Him. Consequently, we know that God loves us and shows clemency toward us, that He is eternally wise and omnipotent. Everything that He does, He does for our benefit, and we should accept it with gratitude as from a Benefactor, even though it may appear to be grievous. * Attaining spiritual peace. 29\\\\. Let us examine as to why a person sometimes gets annoyed when he hears an insult, and other times he endures it without getting agitated. What is the reason for this contrast? And is there one reason or are there several? There are several reasons, although they are all born from a main one. Sometimes it happens that after praying or completing a benevolent exercise, the person finds himself in a kind spiritual disposition and therefore, is amenable to his brother and doesn't get annoyed over his words. It also happens that a person is partial to another, and as a consequence, endures without any annoyance, everything that the individual inflicts upon him. It also happens that a person may despise the individual who wants to insult him, and therefore ignores him. * Humility, vile thoughts. Humility. 31\\\\. Know that if a person is oppressed by some thought and he does not confess it (to his spiritual father), he will give the thought more power to oppose and torment him. If the person confesses the oppressive thought, if he opposes and struggles with it, instilling into himself the desire for the opposite to the thought, then the passion will weaken and will eventually cease to plague him. Thus with time, in committing himself and receiving assistance from God, that person will conquer the passion itself. * Love towards your neighbor. 44\\\\. I heard of one person that when he came to one of his friends and found the room in disarray and even dirty, he would say to himself: \\"Blessed is this person, because having deferred his concerns for earthly cares, he has concentrated his mind that much toward Heaven, that he doesn‚Äôt even have time to tidy up his room.\\" But when he came to another friend's place and found his room tidy and neat, he would say to himself; \\"The soul of this person is as clean as his room, and the condition of the room speaks of his soul.\\" And he never judged another that he was negligent or proud, but through his kind disposition, saw good in everyone and received benefits from everyone. May the good Lord grant us the same kind disposition, so that we too may receive benefits from everyone and so that we never notice the failings of others.

It is frequently abbreviated to LPV. Types of variation The General Catalogue of Variable Stars does not define a long-period variable star type, although it does describe Mira variables as long-period variables. The term was first used in the 19th century, before more precise classifications of variable stars, to refer to a group that were known to vary on timescales typically hundreds of days. By the middle of the 20th century, long period variables were known to be cool giant stars. The relationship of Mira variables, semiregular variables, and other pulsating stars was being investigated and the term long period variable was generally restricted to the coolest pulsating stars, almost all Mira variables. Semiregular variables were considered intermediate between LPVs and Cepheids. After the publication of the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, both Mira variables and semiregular variables, particularly those of type SRa, were both often considered as long period variables. At its broadest, LPVs include Mira, semiregular, slow irregular variables, and OGLE small amplitude red giants (OSARGs), including both giant and supergiant stars. The OSARGs are generally not treated as LPVs, and many authors continue to use the term more restrictively to refer just to Mira and semiregular variables, or solely to Miras. The AAVSO LPV Section covers \\"Miras, Semiregulars, RV Tau and all your favorite red giants\\". The AAVSO LPV Section covers the Mira, SR, and L stars, but also RV Tauri variables, another type of large cool slowly varying star. This includes SRc and Lc stars which are respectively semi-regular and irregular cool supergiants. Recent researches have increasingly focused on the long period variables as only AGB and possibly red giant tip stars. The recently classified OSARGs are by far the most numerous of these stars, comprising a high proportion of red giants. Properties Light curves of four Mira variables in the galaxy Centaurus A Long period variables are pulsating cool giant, or supergiant, variable stars with periods from around a hundred days, or just a few days for OSARGs, to more than a thousand days. In some cases, the variations are too poorly defined to identify a period, although it is an open question whether they are truly non-periodic. LPVs have spectral class F and redwards, but most are spectral class M, S or C. Many of the reddest stars in the sky, such as Y CVn, V Aql, and VX Sgr are LPVs. Most LPVs, including all Mira variables, are thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars with luminosities several thousand times the sun. Some semiregular and irregular variables are less luminous giant stars, while others are more luminous supergiants including some of the largest known stars such as VY CMa. Long secondary periods Between a quarter and a half of long period variables show very slow variations with an amplitude up to one magnitude at visual wavelengths, and a period around ten times the primary pulsation period. These are called long secondary periods. The causes of the long secondary periods are unknown. Binary interactions, dust formation, rotation, or non-radial oscillations have all been proposed as causes, but all have problems explaining the observations. Pulsation modes Mira variables are mostly fundamental mode pulsators, while the semiregular and irregular variables on the asymptotic giant branch pulsate in the first, second, or third overtone. Many of the less regular LPVs pulsate in more than one mode. Long secondary periods cannot be caused by fundamental mode radial pulsations or their harmonics, but strange mode pulsations are one possible explanation.

The B43 was developed from 1956 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, entering production in 1959. It entered service in April 1961. Total production was 2,000 weapons, ending in 1965. Some variants were parachute- retarded and featured a ribbon parachute. The B43 was built in two variants, Mod 1 and Mod 2, each with five yield options. Depending on version, the B43 was in diameter, and length was between and . The various versions weighed between . It could be delivered at altitudes as low as , with fuzing options for airburst, ground burst, free fall, contact, or laydown delivery. Explosive yield varied from 70 kilotons of TNT to 1 megaton of TNT. The B43 used the Tsetse primary design for its fission stage, as did several mid- and late-1950s designs.

From 1982 to 1993 he was a BBC Radio 1 disc jockey and a regular presenter of Top of the Pops. As of 9 June 2017, he can now be heard on BBC Radio 2 presenting a Friday night show Sounds of the 80s as well as standing in for OJ Borg, Zoe Ball and Ken Bruce. Early career After working in marketing for a mail order company and managing a Manchester disco, Davies began his broadcasting career at Manchester's Piccadilly Radio in 1979 before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1982 to present a Saturday late night show, making his debut on 4 December 1982. Within weeks he was on the roster to present Top of the Pops on BBC television alongside his Radio 1 colleagues. BBC Radio 1 =The Bit in the Middle= In 1984, Davies took over the Radio 1 lunchtime show. He called it The Bit in the Middle which consisted of features, such as The Day-To-Day Challenge, in which the same person would go on air each weekday to answer quiz questions and try to upgrade their prize, and Willy on the Plonker, which involved crazed piano-playing of a well-known hit for listeners to identify. On Sunday, 6 September 1987 he presented the Sunday Afternoon Stereo Countdown of the Top 40 from 5pm to 7pm, filling in for Bruno Brookes. There was a marketability about Davies as he was regarded by some female listeners as a heart-throb. He was projected as an eligible bachelor of the station, with a catchphrase \\"Young, Free and Single\\" and a jingle \\"Wooh! Gary Davies\\". Davies own show rarely changed until it was rebranded in 1991 as Let's Do Lunch, with new features, including Spin & Win (a variation on Willy on the Plonker, with a cryptic clue replacing the frenetic piano work) and the Classic Track, which was the one time of the week Radio 1 played a piece of classical music. Previous feature The Sloppy Bit (a dedication followed by love song) was unchanged but renamed Lots of Love. He also introduced The Non Stop Half Hour from after the 2.30pm news until 3pm, which was half an hour of non-stop music. With updated technology, the chart rundown was moved forward to Sundays from 4 October 1987. Instead, Davies did countdowns of the US chart and the UK album chart ‚Äì although the US chart he featured was not the official Billboard one, but an airplay-only chart compiled by Radio and Records magazine. =Weekends= In 1992, Davies quit the lunchtime show and moved to weekend breakfast, keeping a selection of the features. He also started a Sunday late night slot. The Lots of Love feature moved to this show, with dedications being read out over the music to Dances with Wolves. During this period, he could also be heard deputising for weekday presenters when taking their holidays, usually Steve Wright or Nicky Campbell. =Leaving Radio 1= In 1993 Davies was dismissed. His last record was Layla by Derek and the Dominoes ‚Äî which had also been his first record on the station eleven years earlier. Davies was the last Radio 1 DJ to host Top of the Pops before the show's \\"year zero\\" revamp in October 1991. Virgin Radio In January 1994, Davies moved to Virgin Radio, presenting their Sunday morning Classic Tracks slot from 10am to 2pm. The show later went out from 9am to 1pm and he remained there until early 1995. After a brief sabbatical, Davies then rejoined Virgin Radio in December 1995, taking over the Sunday late night show from 10pm to 2am. This gave him the chance to revive his Sunday night format. In 1997, Davies moved to an earlier slot on Sundays from 6-10pm, before moving on to present the weekday late night slot in January 1999, where he remained until December 2000. Recent work Davies was heard on the Real Radio and the Century Network, presenting a CD chart show every Sunday originally from 1 to 4pm but from 2006 the show went out from 4pm to 7pm. However, this finished in mid-2008. Currently he owns a publishing company called Good Groove, where he also manages new artists. Good Groove's 1st publishing hit was Black Coffee by All Saints and Davies later went on to sign singer Corinne Bailey Rae. On 9 June 2017 Davies stood in for Sara Cox to present a special 2¬æ hour edition of Sounds of the 80s on BBC Radio 2. This was his first time back on BBC Radio for 23 years. In October 2017, January & October 2018, and October 2020, Davies sat in for Steve Wright's BBC Radio 2 show. On 18 May 2018, as part of a reorganisation of the Radio 2 DJ roster, following changes to the station's evening line up Davies took over from Sara Cox as the host of Radio 2's Sounds of the 80s. He also provides holiday cover for daytime Radio 2 DJs such as Ken Bruce, OJ Borg, and Zoe Ball.

It was passed by what became known as the Habeas Corpus Parliament to define and strengthen the ancient prerogative writ of habeas corpus, which required a court to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention and thus prevent unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment. Earlier and subsequent history The Act is often wrongly described as the origin of the writ of habeas corpus. But the writ of habeas corpus had existed in various forms in England for at least five centuries before and is thought to have originated in the 12th Century Assize of Clarendon. It was guaranteed, but not created, by Magna Carta in 1215, whose article 39 reads: \\"No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will we send upon him except upon the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land.\\" The Act of 1679 followed an earlier Habeas Corpus Act of 1640, which established that the command of the King or the Privy Council was no answer to a petition of habeas corpus. Further Habeas Corpus Acts were passed by the British Parliament in 1803, 1804, 1816, and 1862, but it is the Act of 1679 which is remembered as one of the most important statutes in English constitutional history. Though amended, it remains on the statute book to this day. Content In criminal matters other than treason and felonies, the act gave prisoners or third parties acting on their behalf the right to challenge their detention by demanding from the Lord Chancellor, Justices of the King's Bench, and the Barons of the Exchequer of the jurisdiction a judicial review of their imprisonment. The act laid out certain temporal and geographical conditions under which prisoners had to be brought before the courts. Jailors were forbidden to move prisoners from one prison to another or out of the country to evade the writ. In case of disobedience jailers would be punished with severe fines which had to be paid to the prisoner. Parliamentary history The Act came about because the Earl of Shaftesbury encouraged his friends in the Commons to introduce the Bill where it passed and was then sent up to the House of Lords. Shaftesbury was the leading Exclusionist‚Äîthose who wanted to exclude Charles II's brother James, Duke of York from the succession‚Äîand the Bill was a part of that struggle as they believed James would rule arbitrarily. The Lords decided to add many wrecking amendments to the Bill in an attempt to kill it; the Commons had no choice but to pass the Bill with the Lords' amendments because they learned that the King would soon end the current parliamentary session. The Bill went back and forth between the two Houses, and then the Lords voted on whether to set up a conference on the Bill. If this motion was defeated the Bill would stay in the Commons and therefore have no chance of being passed. Each side‚Äîthose voting for and against‚Äîappointed a teller who stood on each side of the door through which those Lords who had voted \\"aye\\" re-entered the House (the \\"nays\\" remained seated). One teller would count them aloud whilst the other teller listened and kept watch to know if the other teller was telling the truth. Shaftesbury's faction supported the motion, so they went out and re-entered the House. Gilbert Burnet, one of Shaftesbury's friends, recorded what then happened: > Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the tellers: Lord Norris, being a > man subject to vapours, was not at all times attentive to what he was doing: > so, a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted him as ten, as a jest at > first: but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with this > misreckoning of ten: so it was reported that they that were for the Bill > were in the majority, though indeed it went for the other side: and by this > means the Bill passed.Quoted in J. E. Powell, Great Parliamentary Occasions > 1966: The Queen Anne Press. p. 65. The clerk recorded in the minutes of the Lords that the \\"ayes\\" had fifty-seven and the \\"nays\\" had fifty-five, a total of 112, but the same minutes also state that only 107 Lords had attended that sitting. The King arrived shortly thereafter and gave Royal Assent before proroguing Parliament. The Act is now stored in the Parliamentary Archives.

Suberin, a complex polyester biopolymer, is lipophilic, and composed of long chain fatty acids called suberin acids, and glycerol. Suberins and lignins are considered covalently linked to lipids and carbohydrates, respectively, and lignin is covalently linked to suberin, and to a lesser extent, to cutin. Suberin is a major constituent of cork, and is named after the cork oak, Quercus suber. Its main function is as a barrier to movement of water and solutes. Anatomy and physiology Suberin is highly hydrophobic and a somewhat 'rubbery' material. In roots, suberin is deposited in the radial and transverse cell walls of the endodermal cells. This structure, known as the Casparian strip or Casparian band, functions to prevent water and nutrients taken up by the root from entering the stele through the apoplast. Instead, water must bypass the endodermis via the symplast. This allows the plant to select the solutes that pass further into the plant. It thus forms an important barrier to harmful solutes. For example, mangroves use suberin to minimize salt intake from their littoral habitat. Suberin is found in the phellem layer of the periderm (or cork). This is outermost layer of the bark. The cells in this layer are dead and abundant in suberin, preventing water loss from the tissues below. Suberin can also be found in various other plant structures. For example, they are present in the lenticels on the stems of many plants and the net structure in the rind of a netted melon is composed of suberised cells. Structure and biosynthesis Suberin consists of two domains, a polyaromatic and a polyaliphatic domain. The polyaromatics are predominantly located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the primary cell wall and the cell membrane. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin monomers varies in different species. Some common aliphatic monomers include Œ±-hydroxyacids (mainly 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) and Œ±,œâ-diacids (mainly octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioic acid). The monomers of the polyaromatics are hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine. In addition to the aromatics and aliphatics components, glycerol has been reported a major suberin component in some species. The role of glycerol is proposed to interlink aliphatic monomers, and possibly also to link polyaliphatics to polyaromatics, during suberin polymer assembly. The polymerization step of aromatic monomers has been shown to involve a peroxidase reaction. The biosynthesis of the aliphatic monomers shares the same upstream reactions with cutin biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with lignin biosynthesis. Phlobaphen also occurs in the polyaromatic part of the suberin mixture.

The Casparian strip forces water into the symplast at the root endodermal cells. The chemistry of the Casparian strip has been described as composed of suberin. According to some studies, the Casparian strip begins as a localized deposition of phenolic and unsaturated fatty substances in the middle lamella between the radial walls, as partly oxidized films. The primary wall becomes encrusted with and later thickened by deposits of similar substances on the inside of that wall. The encrustation of the cell wall by the material constituting the Casparian strip presumably plugs the pores that would have otherwise allowed the movement of water and nutrients via capillary action along that path. The cytoplasm of the endodermal cell is firmly attached to the Casparian strip so that it does not readily separate from the strip when the cells are subjected to contraction of the protoplasts. At the root, the Casparian strip is embedded within the cell wall of endodermal cells in the non-growing region of the root behind the root tip.Taiz, L., Zeiger, Eduardo, M√∏ller, Ian Max, & Murphy, Angus. (2015). Plant physiology and development (Sixth ed.). Here, the Casparian strip serves as a boundary layer separating the apoplast of the cortex from the apoplast of the vascular tissue thereby blocking diffusion of material between the two. This separation forces water and solutes to pass through the plasma membrane via a symplastic route in order to cross the endodermis layer. Casparian strips differentiate after an outward growth of the cortex is completed. At this level of the root development, the primary xylem of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In gymnosperms and angiosperms displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with Casparian strips. In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the periderm develops from the pericycle. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with the expansion of the vascular cylinder by radial anticlinal divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones. In the absence of secondary growth (most monocotyledons and a few eudicots), the endodermis commonly undergoes wall modifications. There are two developmental stages beyond the development of the Casparian strip. In the second stage suberin (or endoderm) coats the entire wall on the inside of the cell. As a result, the Casparian strip is separated from the cytoplasm and the connection between the two ceases to be evident. In the third stage, a thick cellulose layer is deposited over the suberin, sometimes mainly on the inner tangential walls. The thickened wall, as well as the original wall in which the Casparian strip is located, may become lignified, creating a secondary cell wall. The Casparian strip may be identifiable after the thickening of the endodermal wall has occurred. The thickened endodermal wall may have pits. The successive development of endodermal walls is clearly expressed in monocotyledons.

They are formed when narrow jets of partially ionised gas ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects are commonly found in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned with its rotational axis. Most of them lie within about one parsec (3.26 light-years) of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium. First observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects were recognised as a distinct type of emission nebula in the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process. Although HH objects are a visible wavelength phenomena, many remain invisible at these wavelengths due to dust and gas, and can only be detected at infrared wavelengths. Such objects, when observed in near infrared, are called molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs).  Discovery and history of observations  The first HH object was observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, when he observed the star T Tauri with the refracting telescope at Lick Observatory and noted a small patch of nebulosity nearby. It was thought to be an emission nebula, later becoming known as Burnham's Nebula, and was not recognized as a distinct class of object. T Tauri was found to be a very young and variable star, and is the prototype of the class of similar objects known as T Tauri stars which have yet to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational collapse and energy generation through nuclear fusion at their centres. Fifty years after Burnham's discovery, several similar nebulae were discovered with almost star-like appearance. Both Haro and Herbig made independent observations of several of these objects in the Orion Nebula during the 1940s. Herbig also looked at Burnham's Nebula and found it displayed an unusual electromagnetic spectrum, with prominent emission lines of hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Haro found that all the objects of this type were invisible in infrared light. Following their independent discoveries, Herbig and Haro met at an astronomy conference in Tucson, Arizona in December 1949. Herbig had initially paid little attention to the objects he had discovered, being primarily concerned with the nearby stars, but on hearing Haro's findings he carried out more detailed studies of them. The Soviet astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian gave the objects their name (Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects, normally shortened to HH objects), and based on their occurrence near young stars (a few hundred thousand years old), suggested they might represent an early stage in the formation of T Tauri stars. Studies of the HH objects showed they were highly ionised, and early theorists speculated that they were reflection nebulae containing low-luminosity hot stars deep inside. But the absence of infrared radiation from the nebulae meant there could not be stars within them, as these would have emitted abundant infrared light. In 1975 American astronomer R. D. Schwartz theorized that winds from T Tauri stars produce shocks in the ambient medium on encounter, resulting in generation of visible light. With the discovery of the first proto-stellar jet in HH 46/47, it became clear that HH objects are indeed shock-induced phenomena with shocks being driven by a collimated jet from protostars.  Formation  Stars form by gravitational collapse of interstellar gas clouds. As the collapse increases the density, radiative energy loss decreases due to increased opacity. This raises the temperature of the cloud which prevents further collapse, and a hydrostatic equilibrium is established. Gas continues to fall towards the core in a rotating disk. The core of this system is called a protostar. Some of the accreting material is ejected out along the star's axis of rotation in two jets of partially ionised gas (plasma). The mechanism for producing these collimated bipolar jets is not entirely understood, but it is believed that interaction between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetic field accelerates some of the accreting material from within a few astronomical units of the star away from the disk plane. At these distances the outflow is divergent, fanning out at an angle in the range of 10‚àí30¬∞, but it becomes increasingly collimated at distances of tens to hundreds of astronomical units from the source, as its expansion is constrained. The jets also carry away the excess angular momentum resulting from accretion of material onto the star, which would otherwise cause the star to rotate too rapidly and disintegrate. When these jets collide with the interstellar medium, they give rise to the small patches of bright emission which comprise HH objects.  Properties  Infrared spectrum of HH 46/47 obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope, showing the medium in immediate vicinity of the star being silicate-rich Electromagnetic emission from HH objects is caused when their associated shock waves collide with the interstellar medium, creating what is called the \\"terminal working surfaces\\". The spectrum is continuous, but also has intense emission lines of neutral and ionized species. Spectroscopic observations of HH objects' doppler shifts indicate velocities of several hundred kilometers per second, but the emission lines in those spectra are weaker than what would be expected from such high-speed collisions. This suggests that some of the material they are colliding with is also moving along the beam, although at a lower speed. Spectroscopic observations of HH objects show they are moving away from the source stars at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. In recent years, the high optical resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the proper motion (movement along the sky plane) of many HH objects in observations spaced several years apart. As they move away from the parent star, HH objects evolve significantly, varying in brightness on timescales of a few years. Individual compact knots or clumps within an object may brighten and fade or disappear entirely, while new knots have been seen to appear. These arise likely because of the precession of their jets, along with the pulsating and intermittent eruptions from their parent stars. Faster jets catch up with earlier slower jets, creating the so-called \\"internal working surfaces\\", where streams of gas collide and generate shock waves and consequent emissions. The total mass being ejected by stars to form typical HH objects is estimated to be of the order of 10‚àí8 to 10‚àí6 per year, a very small amount of material compared to the mass of the stars themselves but amounting to about 1‚Äì10% of the total mass accreted by the source stars in a year. Mass loss tends to decrease with increasing age of the source. The temperatures observed in HH objects are typically about 9,000‚Äì12,000 K, similar to those found in other ionized nebulae such as H II regions and planetary nebulae. Densities, on the other hand, are higher than in other nebulae, ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of particles per cm3, compared to a few thousand particles per cm3 in most H II regions and planetary nebulae. Densities also decrease as the source evolves over time. HH objects consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, which account for about 75% and 24% of their mass respectively. Around 1% of the mass of HH objects is made up of heavier chemical elements, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, iron, calcium and magnesium. Abundances of these elements, determined from emission lines of respective ions, are generally similar to their cosmic abundances. Many chemical compounds found in the surrounding interstellar medium, but not present in the source material, such as metal hydrides, are believed to have been produced by shock-induced chemical reactions. Around 20‚Äì30% of the gas in HH objects is ionized near the source star, but this proportion decreases at increasing distances. This implies the material is ionized in the polar jet, and recombines as it moves away from the star, rather than being ionized by later collisions. Shocking at the end of the jet can re-ionise some material, giving rise to bright \\"caps\\".  Numbers and distribution  HH 2 (lower right), HH 34 (lower left), and HH 47 (top) were numbered in order of their discovery; it is estimated that there are up to 150,000 such objects in the Milky Way. HH objects are named approximately in order of their identification; HH 1/2 being the earliest such objects to be identified. More than a thousand individual objects are now known. They are always present in star-forming H II regions, and are often found in large groups. They are typically observed near Bok globules (dark nebulae which contain very young stars) and often emanate from them. Several HH objects have been seen near a single energy source, forming a string of objects along the line of the polar axis of the parent star. The number of known HH objects has increased rapidly over the last few years, but that is a very small proportion of the estimated up to 150,000 in the Milky Way, the vast majority of which are too far away to be resolved. Most HH objects lie within about one parsec of their parent star. Many, however, are seen several parsecs away. HH 46/47 is located about away from the Sun and is powered by a class I protostar binary. The bipolar jet is slamming into the surrounding medium at a velocity of 300 kilometers per second, producing two emission caps about apart. Jet outflow is accompanied by a long molecular gas outflow which is swept up by the jet itself. Infrared studies by Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed a variety of chemical compounds in the molecular outflow, including water (ice), methanol, methane, carbon dioxide (dry ice) and various silicates. Located around away in the Orion A molecular cloud, HH 34 is produced by a highly collimated bipolar jet powered by a class I protostar. Matter in the jet is moving at about 220 kilometers per second. Two bright bow shocks, separated by about , are present on the opposite sides of the source, followed by series of fainter ones at larger distances, making the whole complex about long. The jet is surrounded by a long weak molecular outflow near the source.  Source stars  Thirteen- year timelapse of material ejecting from a class I protostar, forming the Herbig‚ÄìHaro object HH 34 The stars from which HH jets are emitted are all very young stars, a few tens of thousands to about a million years old. The youngest of these are still protostars in the process of collecting from their surrounding gases. Astronomers divide these stars into classes 0, I, II and III, according to how much infrared radiation the stars emit. A greater amount of infrared radiation implies a larger amount of cooler material surrounding the star, which indicates it is still coalescing. The numbering of the classes arises because class 0 objects (the youngest) were not discovered until classes I, II and III had already been defined. Class 0 objects are only a few thousand years old; so young that they are not yet undergoing nuclear fusion reactions at their centres. Instead, they are powered only by the gravitational potential energy released as material falls onto them. They mostly contain molecular outflows with low velocities (less than a hundred kilometres per second) and weak emissions in the outflows. Nuclear fusion has begun in the cores of Class I objects, but gas and dust are still falling onto their surfaces from the surrounding nebula, and most of their luminosity is accounted for by gravitational energy. They are generally still shrouded in dense clouds of dust and gas, which obscure all their visible light and as a result can only be observed at infrared and radio wavelengths. Outflows from this class are dominated by ionized species and velocities can range up to 400 kilometres per second. The in-fall of gas and dust has largely finished in Class II objects (Classical T Tauri stars), but they are still surrounded by disks of dust and gas, and produce weak outflows of low luminosity. Class III objects (Weak-line T Tauri stars) have only trace remnants of their original accretion disk. About 80% of the stars giving rise to HH objects are binary or multiple systems (two or more stars orbiting each other), which is a much higher proportion than that found for low mass stars on the main sequence. This may indicate that binary systems are more likely to generate the jets which give rise to HH objects, and evidence suggests the largest HH outflows might be formed when multiple‚Äìstar systems disintegrate. It is thought that most stars originate from multiple star systems, but that a sizable fraction of these systems are disrupted before their stars reach the main sequence due to gravitational interactions with nearby stars and dense clouds of gas.  Around proto-brown dwarfs  The first and currently only (as of May 2017) large-scale Herbig-Haro object around a proto-brown dwarf is HH 1165, which is connected to the proto-brown dwarf Mayrit 1701117. HH 1165 has a length of 0.8 light-years (0.26 parsec) and is located in the vicinity of the sigma Orionis cluster. Previously only small mini-jets (‚â§0.03 parsec) were found around proto-brown dwarfs.  Infrared counterparts  HH 49/50 seen in infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope HH objects associated with very young stars or very massive protostars are often hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the cloud of gas and dust from which they form. The intervening material can diminish the visual magnitude by factors of tens or even hundreds at optical wavelengths. Such deeply embedded objects can only be observed at infrared or radio wavelengths, usually in the frequencies of hot molecular hydrogen or warm carbon monoxide emission. In recent years, infrared images have revealed dozens of examples of \\"infrared HH objects\\". Most look like bow waves (similar to the waves at the head of a ship), and so are usually referred to as molecular \\"bow shocks\\". The physics of infrared bow shocks can be understood in much the same way as that of HH objects, since these objects are essentially the same ‚Äì supersonic shocks driven by collimated jets from the opposite poles of a protostar. It is only the conditions in the jet and surrounding cloud that are different, causing infrared emission from molecules rather than optical emission from atoms and ions. In 2009 the acronym \\"MHO\\", for Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Object, was approved for such objects, detected in near infrared, by the International Astronomical Union Working Group on Designations, and has been entered into their on-line Reference Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects. The MHO catalog contains over 2000 objects.

(1932), pp. 9-23, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, JSTOR According to a story recorded by Ambrose and others, it included relics gathered in the Holy Land by his mother, Empress Helena.Ambrose Of Milan: Political Letters And Speeches, pp. 199-200 Constantine's conversion to Christianity, which happened around AD 300, was of great importance. In this period it was believed that touching the body of the deceased or even something that came in contact with the person who had died was said to have special powers.Joe Nickell, Relics of ChristA Dictionary of Christian Antiquities. This belief started a movement to find these relics to protect churches, cities, and even people. History At the time, Constantine I was thought to be protected due to the relic in his possession. The helmet that he wore was said to have a piece of the True Cross that Jesus was crucified on. After Constantine was made Caesar, he issued the Edict of Milan (313), sending his mother Helena to find the True Cross and to send back what she found. Helena found the cross and sent three nails that were used in the crucifixion of Jesus back to Rome and her son Constantine. The helmet that Constantine wore included one of the Holy Nails that Saint Helena found at the crucifixion site. By making the helmet with one of the nails, it was supposed to protect him from any harm. Not only was it a sign of protection, but it was also said to fulfil the prophecy of Zechariah. The prophecy located in the fourteenth chapter of the Book of Zechariah said that one would come who engraved ‚ÄúHoliness to the Lord‚Äù on both the bells of the horses and headpiece of the man. At this time, the Roman emperor had the holiest relics known to man. A rare silver medallion dated 315AD shows Constantine with a chi-rho symbol as the crest of his helmet, and Eusebius' Life of Constantine records that he often wore such a helmet in later life, although it is not visible in other bronze coins.Constantine the Great coins, thesis, pp. 11-12 Constantine was very aware of this, and let the entire Roman Empire know that he was the owner of this holy helmet. The emperor had coins made with the image of him wearing his helmet on the front. On every VLLP coin that was made, Constantine was shown wearing his helmet. This was one way that Constantine moved the Roman Empire away from the pagan religion and towards Christianity. The coins that were made after Constantine acquired his helmet showed that the nail was not the only thing that made his helmet religious. Constantine also had the Christogram inscribed on the helmet. There were also a few religious symbols that were placed on the helmet. The Christogram was placed on the helmet, which usually represented the cross, but at times it was interpreted as Jesus Christ himself. Another one of these symbols was a labarum piercing a dragon, a serpent. This was significant because the serpent was represented as the Devil. But it was also the symbol for any enemy that the Roman Empire had. Constantine's helmet stood for the strength that the Roman Empire had through military force, and God. The helmet was put on the coins to let everyone know of this.Constantine the Great coins Constantine's helmet was mainly a crown that was fastened to the head by two clamps. The majority of the helmet was made out of iron and gold. Constantine thought having the chi-roh symbol on the helmet would give him added protection to that of the relic that was already in the helmet.Andreas Alfoldi, The Helmet of Constantine With the Christian Monogram. The crown that was made with the nail was placed around a full helmet when the Emperor went into battle, but could easily be taken off. It was called a helmet; however, he wore it. This is because of the two clamps that held it in place. If these two clamps were not on the original crown it would not be called a helmet at all.

They are designed to be effective against enemy troops, vehicles, and buildings. Characteristics General-purpose (GP) bombs use a thick-walled metal casing with explosive filler (typically TNT, Composition B, or Tritonal in NATO or United States service) comprising about 30% to 40% of the bomb's total weight. The British term for a bomb of this type is \\"medium case\\" or \\"medium capacity\\" (MC). The GP bomb is a common weapon of fighter bomber and attack aircraft because it is useful for a variety of tactical applications and relatively cheap. General-purpose bombs are often identified by their weight (e.g., 500 lb, 227 kg). In many cases this is strictly a nominal weight (the counterpart to the caliber of a firearm), and the actual weight of each individual weapon may vary depending on its retardation, fusing, carriage, and guidance systems. For example, the actual weight of a U.S. M117 bomb, nominally 750 lb (340 kg), is typically around 820 lb (372 kg). Most modern air-dropped GP bombs are designed to minimize drag for external carriage on aircraft lacking bomb bays. In low-altitude attacks, there is a danger of the attacking aircraft being caught in the blast of its own weapons. To address this problem, GP bombs are often fitted with retarders, parachutes or pop-out fins that slow the bomb's descent to allow the aircraft time to escape the detonation. GP bombs can be fitted with a variety of fuzes and fins for different uses. One notable example is the \\"daisy cutter\\" fuze used in Vietnam War era American weapons, an extended probe designed to ensure that the bomb would detonate on contact (even with foliage) rather than burying itself in earth or mud, which would reduce its effectiveness. (This was not the first instance of such devices. As early as World War II, the Luftwaffe was using extended-nose fuzes on bombs dropped by Stuka dive-bombers and other aircraft for exactly the same reason. A blast several feet above the ground is many times more effective and has a far greater radius than one that is delayed until the bomb is below the surface.) GP bombs are commonly used as the warheads for more sophisticated precision-guided munitions. Using various types of seeker and electrically controlled fins turns a basic 'iron' bomb into a laser-guided bomb (like the U.S. Paveway series), an electro-optical guided bomb, or, more recently, GPS-guided weapon (like the U.S. JDAM). The combination is cheaper than a true guided missile (and can be more easily upgraded or replaced in service), but is substantially more accurate than an unguided bomb.  Modern GP bombs =Modern American GP bombs: the Mark 80 series= A Mk. 82 GP bomb loaded on an F/A-18 Hornet, showing nose fuze and textured thermal insulation During the Korean War and Vietnam War the U.S. used older designs like the M65, M117 and M118, which had an explosive content about 65% higher than most contemporary weapons. Although some of these weapons remain in the U.S. arsenal, they are little used and the M117 is primarily carried only by the B-52 Stratofortress. The primary U.S. GP bombs are the Mark 80 series. This class of weapons uses a shape known as Aero 1A, designed by Ed Heinemann of Douglas Aircraft as the result of studies in 1946. It has a length-to-diameter ratio of about 8:1, and results in minimal drag for the carrier aircraft. The Mark 80 series was not used in combat until the Vietnam War, but has since replaced most earlier GP weapons. It includes four basic weapon types: * Mark 81 ‚Äì nominal weight * Mark 82 ‚Äì nominal weight * Mark 83 ‚Äì nominal weight * Mark 84 ‚Äì nominal weight Vietnam service showed the Mk 81 \\"Firecracker\\" to be insufficiently effective, and it was withdrawn from U.S. service. However, recently, precision-guided variants of the Mk 81 bomb have begun a return to service, based on U.S. experience in Iraq after 2003, and the desire to reduce collateral damage compared to Mk 82 and larger bombs (e.g., when attacking a single small building in a populated area). Since the Vietnam War and the 1967 USS Forrestal fire, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps GP bombs are distinguished by a thick ablative fire- retardant coating, which is designed to delay any potential accidental explosion in the event of a shipboard fire. Land-based air forces typically do not use such coatings, largely because they add some 30 lb (14 kg) to the weight of the complete weapon. Fire is less a danger in a land-based facility, where the personnel can be evacuated with relative ease, and the building be the only loss. At sea, the crew and munitions share a facility (the ship), and thus are in much more danger of fire reaching munitions (which tend to be more closely packed, due to space limitations). Also, losing a munitions storage building on land is far cheaper than sacrificing an entire naval vessel, even if one could easily evacuate the crew. All Mk80 bombs have both nose and tail fuze wells and can accept a variety of fuzes. Various nose and tail kits can be fitted to adapt the weapon for a variety of roles. In the Mk 80 series bomb bodies is also used in the following weapons: * BDU-50 A practice (no explosive) version of the Mk 82 bomb body * BDU-56 A practice (no explosive) version of the Mk 84 bomb body On August 14, 2020, Kaman Precision Products received roughly $57.3 million for a \\"cockpit-selectable\\" bomb fuze to be used on Mark 80 warheads (guided and unguided).

Usage is increasingly dominated by guided versions. =WWII-era British general-purpose bombs= During WWII the British adopted a description of general-purpose bombs as medium capacity (MC) bombs. The 1000 lb MC was developed from 1942 to replace the existing 1000 lb GP (General Purpose) bomb. Initially using most of the components of the 1000 lb GP it was decided to give it a new tail and it was built with a half-inch-thick wall. Fillings could be Amatex, Amatol, Minol, RDX and others. Actual weight was around 1020 lb (464 kg). It was introduced to service in 1943 and about a quarter of a million were produced by the end of the war.

Most Russian iron bombs have circular ring airfoils rather than the fins used by Western types. In 1946 the Soviet Union developed a series of freefall bombs in four sizes 250 kg (550 lb), 500 kg (1,100 lb), 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), and 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) and sharing a single nose and a single tail fuze. The bomb could be dropped from up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) and up to 1,000 km/h (625 mph). The original, 1946-series bombs had poor ballistic characteristics at supersonic speed, and their construction was fragile. As an interim measure, upgraded versions of the bombs were built with thicker walls and no nose fuze. The thick-walled version of the bombs were built until 1956. The 1954 series of high-drag bombs was built in six sizes: 250 kg (550 lb), 500 kg (1,100 lb), 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), 3,000 kg (6,600 lb), 5,000 kg (11,000 lb), and 9,000 kg (20,000 lb). A feature of the 1954 series of bombs is the ballistic ring on the nose of the bomb which acts as a vortex generator to aid the bombs stabilizers. The smaller (less than 3,000 kg) bombs had a single nose and a single tail fuze, while the larger weapons shared a single nose fuze and two base fuzes. The FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) weapon was roughly comparable to the wartime Grand Slam bomb. It was used by Russian aircraft designers as a substitute for early nuclear weapons when determining the size and clearances of bomb bays. In 1962 a new series of streamlined, low-drag bombs was introduced, designed for external carriage by fighter-bomber aircraft rather than in internal bays. They come in only two sizes, 250 kg (550 lb) and 500 kg (1,100 lb). Both bombs have a single nose fuze. Both the 54 and 62 series designs remain in use. The most common of these are the FAB-100, FAB-250, FAB-500, FAB-750, and FAB-1500, roughly corresponding to the U.S. Mark 80 series. These have seen widespread service in Russia, Warsaw Pact nations, and various export countries. Larger bombs with less streamlined shapes also remained in the Soviet arsenal, primarily for use by heavy bombers. In the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, FAB-5000 (5,000 kg/11,000 lb) and FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) bombs were dropped by Iraqi Air Force Tupolev Tu-22 bombers, generally against large, fixed targets in Iran. In Afghanistan in the 1980s, Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 and Tupolev Tu-22M bombers used massive FAB-1500, FAB-3000, FAB-5000NG, and FAB-9000 bombs to devastating effect during the Panjshir offensives. * FAB-100http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/HH12%20-%20FAB%20M62.html * FAB-250M-54http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/fab-250.htm * KhAB-250 * KhAB-500 * FAB-500 * FAB-500M-54 * FAB-500M-62 * KAB-250http://www.janes.com/article/55095/russia-s-kab-250-guided-bomb-to- complete-trials-this-year * KAB-250S-Ehttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/bombs.htmhttp://www.cat- uxo.com/#/aircraft-bombs-russian/4583661419 * KAB-250LG-E * KAB-500L * KAB-500Kr * KAB-1500L * KAB-1500Kr =French GP bombs= France's GP bombs, marketed by Matra and built by the Soci√©t√© des Ateliers M√©canique de Port-sur- Sambre (SAMP) are made in a variety of types with nominal weights from 50 kg (110 lb) to 1,000 kg (2,205 lb).

He was born to Italian immigrants in New York City, where he lived, attended college and began his career through his young adult years. After working odd jobs and as a banker, Barbera joined Van Beuren Studios in 1927 and subsequently Terrytoons in 1929. In 1930, he moved to California and while working at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Barbera met William Hanna. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry. In 1957, after MGM dissolved their animation department, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo, Top Cat, The Smurfs, Huckleberry Hound, and The Jetsons. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12 million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company. In 1991, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn was merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors. Hanna and Barbera directed seven Academy Award films and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoon shows have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 28 languages. Early and personal life Joseph Barbera was born at 10 Delancey Street in the Little Italy (Lower East Side) section of Manhattan, New York, to Italian immigrants Vincent Barbera (1889-1965), born in Castelvetrano (of Lebanese origins Extract of page 23) and Francesca Calvacca Barbera (1875-1969), born in Sciacca, Italy. He grew up speaking Italian. His family moved to Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York when he was four months old. He had two younger brothers, Larry (1912-1999) and Ted (1914-2000), both of whom served in World War II. As a member of the United States Army, Larry participated in the invasion of Sicily. Ted was a fighter pilot with the United States Army Air Forces and served in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. Barbera's father, Vincent, was the prosperous owner of three barbershops who squandered the family fortunes on gambling. By the time Barbera was 15, his father had abandoned the family and his maternal uncle Jim became a father figure to him. Barbera displayed a talent for drawing as early as the first grade. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1928.English, Merle. \\"BROOKLYN DIARY Portrait of The Cartoon Artist As a Young Man\\" , Newsday, September 22, 1991. Accessed October 22, 2009. \\"But his most cherished memories are of his days at Erasmus Hall High School, from which he was graduated in 1928.\\" While in high school, Barbera won several boxing titles. He was briefly managed by World Lightweight Boxing Champion Al Singer's manager but soon lost interest in boxing. In 1935, Barbera married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Earl. In school, they had been known as \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". Barbera and his wife briefly separated when he went to California. They reunited but were on the verge of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had four children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne, who has been a producer in her own right). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, sister of British rock and roll singer Vince Taylor at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented. Career =Early career= During high school, Barbera worked as a tailor's delivery boy. In 1929, he became interested in animation after watching a screening of The Skeleton Dance. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with a job at a bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's‚Äîthe magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place. Barbera took art classes at the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired to work in the ink and paint department of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and an earlier Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and- mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio. In 1935, Barbera created his first solo-effort storyboard about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko in an airplane race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts ... > \\"I was, quite honestly, not in the least disappointed. I had proven to > myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of > presenting it. For now, that was enough.\\" The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013. =Film= Lured by a substantial salary increase, Barbera left Terrytoons and New York for the new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) cartoon unit in California in 1937. He found that Los Angeles was suffering just as much from the Great Depression as Brooklyn and almost returned to Brooklyn. Barbera's desk was opposite that of William Hanna. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM. In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed Puss Gets the Boot, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, Fred Quimby, did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby, who had wanted to start a new animation unit independent from Ising, then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry. Modeled after the Puss Gets the Boot characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because \\"we knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought.\\" The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's The Midnight Snack. Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on Tom and Jerry, directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films. Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent. Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, The Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943)‚Äîa war-time adventure. Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM's live-action films, including Anchors Aweigh (1945) and Invitation to the Dance (1956) with Gene Kelly, and Dangerous When Wet (1953) with Esther Williams. In addition to his work in animated cartoons, Barbera and Tom and Jerry layout artist Harvey Eisenberg moonlit to run a comic book company named Dearfield Publishing.Shostak, Stu (November 3, 2011). \\"Interview with Jerry Eisenberg, Scott Shaw!, and Earl Kress \\".

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry without inviting Barbera and Hanna onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising. Quimby once delayed a promised raise to Barbera by six months . When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As MGM began to lose more revenue on animated cartoons due to television, the studio soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Barbera and Hanna's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Barbera and Hanna found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful. =Television= In 1957, Barbera reteamed with his former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release. As they had at MGM, the two brought their different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna-Barbera Productions. Barbera and Hanna's MGM colleague George Sidney, the director of Anchors Aweigh, became the third partner and business manager in the company, and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems, the television division of Columbia Pictures, who took part ownership of the new studio. The first offering from the new company was The Ruff & Reddy Show, a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat. Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, Loopy De Loop, Hanna-Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Yogi Bear Show. A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of Huckleberry Hound were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, The Flintstones. A parody of The Honeymooners, the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests. With an audience of both children and adults, The Flintstones became the first animated prime-time show to be a hit. Fred Flintstone's signature exclamation \\"yabba dabba doo\\" soon entered everyday usage, and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field. The company later produced a futuristic version of The Flintstones, known as The Jetsons. Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, The Flintstones was far more popular. By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business. The Hanna-Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100 cartoon series they produced were The Quick Draw McGraw Show, Top Cat, Jonny Quest, The Magilla Gorilla Show, The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show, Scooby-Doo, Super Friends, and The Smurfs. The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as the feature-length films Charlotte's Web and Heidi's Song. As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna-Barbera was key in the development of an animation technique known as limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but often reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Critics criticized the change from detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna-Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation paved the way for future animated series such as The Simpsons, SpongeBob SquarePants, and South Park. In December 1966, Hanna- Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting (renamed Great American Communications in 1987) for $12 million. Barbera and Hanna remained at the head of the company until 1991. At that point, the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $320 million. Turner began using Hanna-Barbera's television catalog as material for its new Cartoon Network cable channel in 1992, and by the mid-1990s Hanna-Barbera was producing several original series for Cartoon Network, among them Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., who would eventually absorb Hanna-Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation. Barbera and Hanna continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including shorts for the series The Cartoon Cartoon Show and feature film versions of The Flintstones (1994) and Scooby-Doo (2002). In a new Tom and Jerry cartoon produced in 2000, The Mansion Cat, Barbera voiced the houseowner. After Hanna's death from throat cancer in March 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation, with the unit dedicated to the Cartoon Network original series spun off into Cartoon Network Studios. Barbera remained active as an executive producer for Warner Bros. on direct-to-video cartoon features as well as television series such as What's New, Scooby-Doo? and Tom and Jerry Tales. He also wrote, co-storyboarded, co-directed and co-produced The Karate Guard (2005), the return of Tom and Jerry to the big screen. His final animated project was the direct-to-video feature Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale (2007). Legacy Most of the cartoons Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble, Dick Dastardly and Muttley, Tom and Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, Jake Clawson/Razor and Chance Furlong/T-Bone, The Jetson family and Yogi & Boo-Boo, as well as Cartoon Network characters created by Hanna-Barbera such as Johnny Bravo and Carl, Dexter and his supercomputer, the Powerpuff Girls, Cow and Chicken and their schoolmates Flem and Earl, I.M. Weasel and I.R. Baboon and even Cartoon Network shows not actually created by Hanna-Barbera itself such as Ed, Edd n Eddy, Courage the Cowardly Dog and the Bagges, the Sector V from Codename: Kids Next Door and the animated versions of Japanese pop rock group Puffy AmiYumi from Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna shared for over 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses very well, but Barbera and Hanna traveled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities‚ÄîZsa Zsa Gabor was a frequent visitor to his house. Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink. Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: \\"We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work.\\" Hanna once said that Barbera could \\"capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I've ever known.\\" Barbera and Hanna were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television. Leonard Maltin says the Hanna‚ÄìBarbera team \\"held a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year‚Äîwithout a break or change in routine their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture\\". They are often considered Walt Disney's only rivals in cartoon animation. Barbera and Hanna had a lasting impact on television animation. Cartoons they created often make greatest lists. Many of their characters have appeared in film, books, toys, and other media. Their shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages. The works of Barbera and Hanna have been praised not only for their animation, but for their music. The Cat Concerto (1946) and Johann Mouse (1952) have both been called \\"masterpieces of animation\\" largely because of their classical music. In all, the Hanna‚ÄìBarbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards, including the 1960 award for The Huckleberry Hound Show, which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series. They also won these awards: Golden Globe for Television Achievement (1960), Golden IKE Award ‚Äì Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting (1983), Pioneer Award ‚Äì Broadcast Music Incorporated (1987), Iris Award ‚Äì NATPE Men of the Year (1988), Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association award for Lifetime Achievement (1988), Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (1988), Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film (1988), Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications ‚Äì Broadcasting Division College ‚Äì Conservatory of Music University of Cincinnati (1989), stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1976), several Annie Awards, several environmental awards, and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994. In March 2005 the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy's Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera. In 1992, Barbera met with pop musician Michael Jackson, an avid cartoon fan, in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange for him to sing in Tom and Jerry: The Movie. Barbera drew five quick sketches of Tom and Jerry for Jackson and autographed them. Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words: \\"To my hero of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, with many thanks for all the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child. They were all I had. ‚Äì Michael\\" See also * Golden age of American animation * Tom and Jerry filmography * List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions * Peace on Earth (remade by Barbera and Hanna as Good Will to Men) * Tom and Jerry awards and nominations References Further reading   External links * * Hanna Barbera Studios * * Mark Evanier's recollections * National Public Radio Joe Barbera Obituary by Joe Bevilacqua * 1990 WNYC Radio Interview with Joe Barbera by Joe Bevilacqua * Category:1911 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American film directors of Italian descent Category:Animators from California Category:Animators from New York (state) Category:American animated film directors Category:American animated film producers Category:Animation screenwriters Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:American storyboard artists Category:Television producers from New York City Category:American television directors Category:Erasmus Hall High School alumni Category:Film directors from New York City Category:Hanna-Barbera people Category:Voice directors Category:People from Flatbush, Brooklyn Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:American people of Sicilian descent Category:Directors of Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:Emmy Award winners Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) ","title":"Joseph Barbera"},{"id":"1123639","text":"The Canton of Wingles is a canton of France, located in the Pas-de-Calais department, in the Hauts-de-France region.

William, Lord Hastings, began work on the castle in 1480, founding it on the site of a pre- existing manor house. William was a favourite of King Edward IV and had prospered considerably during the Wars of the Roses. Work continued quickly until 1483, when William was executed during Richard, Duke of Gloucester's, seizure of the throne. His widow briefly continued the project after his death but efforts then ceased, with the castle remaining largely incomplete. Parts of the castle were inhabited for a period, before falling into ruin during the course of the 17th century. In 1912, the Commissioners of Work took over management of the site, repairing the brickwork and carrying out an archaeological survey. In the 21st century, the castle is controlled by English Heritage and open to visitors. The castle was rectangular in design, across, and would have comprised four corner towers, three side towers and a large gatehouse, all protected by a water-filled moat; the centre of the castle would have formed a courtyard. Of these buildings, only the gatehouse and the west tower survive today, partially intact. They are constructed with decorative brickwork and stone detailing, in a fashionable late 15th-century style, and have various symbols built into their walls using darker bricks. Twelve gunports for early gunpowder artillery were built into the walls of these two buildings, although historians are uncertain whether these defences were intended to be practical or symbolic. The government body Historic England considers the castle to be a \\"spectacular example of a late medieval quadrangular castle of the highest status\\". History =15th‚Äì17th centuries= Kirby Muxloe Castle was built by William, Lord Hastings, the chamberlain of the royal household and a favourite of Edward IV. William had acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the Wars of the Roses, much of it confiscated from his enemies. William's father, Sir Leonard, had maintained his seat at Kirby Muxloe, but William moved his own seat to the manor of Ashby de la Zouch in 1462.; In 1474, Edward granted William the right to crenellate, or fortify, four of his manors and to build deer parks around them. Among these was Kirby Muxloe, which the King authorised to be turned into a castle and surrounded by a large park of .; The exterior of the gatehouse Work began on Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the direction of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site.; It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down. Edward IV died in 1483, leaving the kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had his own ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the deposition of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation.; Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued some work on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around ¬£1,000 had been spent on the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.; At least initially, some parts of the castle were occupied, possibly including the remains of the original manor house.; ; The castle continued to be owned by the Hastings family until around 1630, when it was purchased by Sir Robert Banaster, and then by William Wollaston.; Over the course of the rest of the century, Kirby Muxloe Castle was abandoned; it was robbed for its building materials, and became used for agricultural purposes.; =18th‚Äì21st centuries= The ruins of the castle, depicted in 1826 The castle was purchased from the Wollaston family in 1788 by Clement Winstanley.; In 1790, the remains of the north tower were still standing, albeit in very poor condition. Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted to pull the northern ruins down, intending to reuse the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle.; By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of the tops of the walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle.; ; Much of the moat had silted up and the remains of the bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris. By 1911, the owner Major Richard Winstanley was unable to pay for the upkeep of the castle and, concerned about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works.; Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913.; ; He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge. There had been hopes of finding additional remains during Peers' archaeological investigations but, although the foundations of the original manor house were uncovered, few other items were discovered.; The complete financial records of the castle's construction, however, were found in the archives of the Hastings family by the historian Thomas Fosbrooke while he was investigating Ashby by de la Zouch castle, who passed them to Peers; they have since provided what the historian John Goodall describes as \\"a fascinating insight\\" into medieval building operations.; In the 21st century, Kirby Muxloe Castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 2,461 visitors in 2015. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 2006, including extensive replacement of much of the brickwork. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and Historic England considers it to be a \\"spectacular example of a late medieval quadrangular castle of the highest status\\". Architecture =Location= Kirby Muxloe Castle is positioned set back from the village of Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle's gardens and orchard probably stood to the north and west of the current site.; John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with the other on the north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: he suggests that it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns. =Design= Plan of the castle.

An inner range of buildings, deep, ran around the inside of the curtain wall, set back slightly from the wall itself and forming a central courtyard.; The towers projected into the water-filled moat which surrounded the castle.; The moat was supplied with water from a small brook, which also fed a suite of stew ponds for the castle.; Two dams were constructed to create the moat, the first to divert water from the main stream, and the second to control the water level in the moat. The current sluices are modern, but the originals were made from wood and leather. The moat, between and wide, was crossed by an oak bridge. Only the gatehouse and the west tower still survive, partially intact. The gatehouse was originally protected by a drawbridge and a portcullis. The gatehouse was rectangular, built from brick with stone detailing, with four polygonal turrets.; Had it been completed, it might have been tall and have resembled the gatehouse at Layer Marney Tower. On the ground floor, two chambers, including the porter's lodge, flanked the gate passage.; The first floor housed the portcullis mechanism and a garderobe. If the second floor was ever completed, it has since been lost. The west tower is across externally and internally, made of simple patterned brickwork, with three floors and two, slightly taller, turrets on the inside corners.; ; Each floor had a single chamber, with a fireplace and an adjacent garderobe, which would have formed lodgings for senior members of the household.; ; The castle was primarily built from bricks, with stone used for the detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice.; Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.; Gunports for early gunpowder artillery had begun to be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the draughts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design and may have been intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.

The line extends from the Frankston line and is part of the city's suburban passenger railway network, and the Myki integrated ticketing system (Zone 2), but is not electrified like the rest of Melbourne's rail network. It has operated with a variety of rolling stock over, and was the last suburban service in Australia to be operated by a locomotive hauled train. The line is also used by freight trains serving the Long Island steel mill in Hastings.  Services  Passenger services are run as a shuttle service between Frankston and Stony Point, with passengers from Flinders Street required to change at Frankston station. It is the only non-electrified line operated by Metro Trains, which operates Melbourne's suburban heavy rail network. Since 27 April 2008, services have been operated using Sprinter diesel multiple units leased from V/Line, replacing the previous A class locomotive hauled trains and MTH carriages. The services appear in the suburban Working timetable and are given 85xx series train numbers, which fall under the 8xxx series given to non- electric passenger services. Goods trains operated by Pacific National serving the Long Island steel mills use the line as far as the junction of the Long Island line between Tyabb and Hastings. Steel trains generally run twice daily. Trains from Long Island to Melbourne run approximately 4 am and mid- afternoon, while trains from Melbourne to Long Island run approximately midnight and noon.  History  Stony Point station in 1892 Sprinters at Baxter junction Goods train, Hillcrest Road level crossing, Frankston Stony Point station Bittern The Stony Point line was opened from Frankston to Baxter station in 1888, and Hastings, Bittern and Stony Point in 1889. Branches were opened from Baxter to Mornington in 1889, and from Bittern to Red Hill in 1921. The long branch from Long Island Junction to Long Island was opened on 29 April 1969 to serve the adjacent steel mill. The Red Hill line was closed in 1953. The Mornington line remained until 1981, but the line south of Moorooduc is now operated by the Mornington Railway as a tourist railway. Passenger services on the entire line were withdrawn on 10 June 1981, and the line from Long Island Junction to Stony Point closed from 22 June 1981 until 26 September 1984, when passenger services were reintroduced. For the reopening DRC railcars DRC40 and DRC 41 used, with two MTH carriages in between them making up a 4 car train. The DRC railcars were frequently used, either in multiple or with MTH trailer cars. Frequent breakdowns saw diesel locomotives called in to haul the consist instead. In December 1989, to celebrate the centenary of the opening of the line, DERM 58RM was used to provide shuttles. On that day the DRC railcar had failed, and a third series T class was used with two MTH carriages to provide the regular service. During November 1987, locomotives used on the service included P15, T403, T355, P12 and P18. The locomotives were changed on a daily basis due to excessive wear of brake blocks from the constant stopping and setting back movements. Despite their failures the DRC railcars remained the preferred rolling stock until at least 1990. In August 1994, a T class with two MTH carriages were used, but by November 1995, weekday services were being operated by a P class with 2 MTH carriages, with an A class used on weekends with an extra MTH car. On another occasion in November 1995, an X class diesel in V/Line Freight livery was used with three MTH carriages, but these kinds of workings disappeared after V/Line was separated into passenger and freight divisions. By the 2000s, the service had settled down, with the A class locomotive and a single MTH carriage sent between Frankston and Spencer Street on a regular basis for refuelling and maintenance. Two MTH carriages would be used on the train, a third stabled at Frankston, and the fourth would be at Spencer Street or the Newport Workshops undergoing repairs. An A class locomotive and two car MTH consist could carry 126 passengers, weighed 199 tonnes and was 56.9 metres long; but with an extra car a total of 238 passengers could be carried, which weighed 238 tonnes and was 76.1 metres long. At some point the ownership of the MTH carriages was transferred from country operator V/Line to suburban operator M>Train, and later Connex Melbourne. On a limited number of occasions V/Line underwent locomotive shortages, with leased A classes from Freight Australia and later Pacific National appearing on the train in their green and yellow livery. In late 2007, the safeworking on the line was altered, with the Electric Staff and Train Staff and Ticket sections replaced by Automatic and Track Control signalling controlled remotely from Frankston Signal Box. On 27 April 2008, diesel railcars were again introduced on the line, this time with the Sprinter units originally purchased by V/Line in 1993. Two units usually operate the service, with a single unit returning to Southern Cross for servicing on a regular basis, with another sent in the opposite direction to replace it. The units are selected from the normal V/Line fleet, and are not dedicated to the run. No ticketing equipment is fitted, but new locks were fitted to the toilet doors to prevent their use when being used by Metro Trains Melbourne. On 1 April 2015, passenger services were suspended indefinitely following a series of safety breaches where boom gates failed to drop for an approaching train. After three months of remedial works, a full passenger service returned to the line on 30 June 2015. In July 2018, the state opposition announced that if it won the 2018 election, it would begin work in 2019 to extend the Frankston line to Baxter station. The project involved duplication and electrification of Frankston‚ÄìBaxter section and would have added two new stations‚ÄîFrankston East and Langwarrin.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-16/frankston-baxter- rail-upgrade-frankston-east-langwarrin/10000738 However, the existing Government was returned to office.

It is a common term in IP network monitoring, and differs from round-trip time (RTT) in that only path in the one direction from source to destination is measured. Measurement The ping utility measures the RTT, that is, the time to go and come back to a host. Half the RTT is often used as an approximation of OWD but this assumes that the forward and back paths are the same in terms of congestion, number of hops, or quality of service (QoS). This is not always a good assumption. To avoid such problems, the OWD may be measured directly. =Direct= OWDs may be measured between two points A and B of an IP network through the use of synchronized clocks; A records a timestamp on the packet and sends it to B, which notes the receiving time and calculates the OWD as their difference. The transmitted packets need to be identified at source and destination in order to avoid packet loss or packet reordering. However, this method suffers several limitations, such as requiring intensive cooperation between both parties, and the accuracy of the measured delay is subject to the synchronization precision. The Minimum-Pairs Protocol is an example by which several cooperating entities, A, B, and C, could measure OWDs between one of them and a fourth less cooperative one (e.g., between B and X). =Estimate= Transmission between two network nodes may be asymmetric, and the forward and reverse delays are not equal. Half the RTT value is the average of the forward and reverse delays and so may be sometimes used as an approximation to the end-to-end delay. The accuracy of such an estimate depends on the nature of delay distribution in both directions. As delays in both directions become more symmetric, the accuracy increases. The probability mass function (PMF) of absolute error, E, between the smaller of the forward and reverse OWDs and their average (i.e., RTT/2) can be expressed as a function of the network delay distribution as follows: ::\\\\Pr(E = x) = \\\\begin{cases}\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty f_i(a).f_i(b), &x;=0,\\\\\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty f_i(a).f_{2x+i}(b) + \\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty f_i(b).f_{2x+i}(a), &x;>0.\\\\end{cases} where a and b are the forward and reverse edges, and fy(z) is the PMF of delay of edge z (that is, fy(z) = Pr{delay on edge z = y}). Delay components End-to-end-delay in networks comes from several sources including transmission delay, propagation delay, processing delay and queuing delay.

It allows administrators to add mail filters for filtering spam or viruses in the mail- processing chain. In the language of the art, \\"milter\\" refers to the protocol and API implementing the service, while \\"a milter\\" has come to refer to a filter application that uses milter to provide service. History Prior to the advent of milter, an email filter was generally implemented as a program to which an MTA would hand the message once it has completely arrived, with most of the message's envelope information removed. That program could then analyze the header and body of the message and make a decision to accept the message (i.e. return a \\"success\\" status to the MTA) or reject it (i.e. return a \\"failed\\" status to the MTA). The MTA would then log a successful delivery or return a failure message to the sender as appropriate, and the filter would be responsible for effecting delivery of the message (to the intended inbox(es) as-is, or modified to remove unwanted content, or to specific folder(s), etc.). An MTA that is milter-capable instead notifies filters to which it is connected about each phase of the delivery of a message, from initial client connection through completion of transmission. At each phase of the SMTP session, the filter is given data about the arriving message and then has an opportunity to terminate acceptance of the message early when appropriate. For very large messages, this can have an enormous impact when a decision to reject can be made as early as possible. Moreover, unlike the former model, a milter-capable MTA can connect to multiple filters in parallel that serve specific purposes such as anti-virus, anti-spam, message authentication, flow regulation, etc. Finally, such filters can take special action on the message: add or remove recipients in the envelope; alter the body prior to delivery; add, change or remove header fields in the message, etc. The Sendmail Consortium includes a special thread-based library in the sendmail distribution that provides the milter API. MTAs =Sendmail= Milter was first officially introduced to Sendmail 8.12.0 released on September 8, 2001. Milter was available in sendmail 8.11.x versions as an FFR (For Future Release/Beta code).

The inability to break down these molecules results in a wide variety of symptoms caused by damage to several different organ systems, including but not limited to the nervous system, skeletal system, eyes, and heart. The underlying mechanism is a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible breaking down GAGs. Without this enzyme, a buildup of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate occurs in the body. Symptoms appear during childhood, and early death usually occurs. Other, less severe forms of MPS Type I include Hurler-Scheie Syndrome (MPS-IHS) and Scheie Syndrome (MPS-IS). Hurler syndrome is classified as a lysosomal storage disease. It is clinically related to Hunter syndrome (MPS II); however, Hunter syndrome is X-linked, while Hurler syndrome is autosomal recessive. Signs and symptoms Corneal clouding in a 30-year-old male with MPS VI. Hurler syndrome and other MPS disorders may also present with corneal clouding Children with Hurler syndrome may appear normal at birth and develop symptoms over the first years of life. Symptoms vary between patients. One of the first abnormalities that may be detected is coarsening of the facial features; these symptoms can begin at 3-6 months of age. The head can be large with prominent frontal bones. The skull can be elongated. The nose can have a flattened nasal bridge with continuous nasal discharge. The eye sockets may be widely spaced, and the eyes may protrude from the skull. The lips can be large, and affected children may hold their jaws open constantly. Skeletal abnormalities occur by about age 6 months, but may not be clinically obvious until 10-14 months. Patients may experience debilitating spine and hip deformities, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness. Patients may be normal height in infancy, but stop growing by the age of 2 years. They may not reach a height of greater than 4 feet. Other early symptoms may include inguinal and umbilical hernias. These may be present at birth, or they may develop within the first months of life. Clouding of the cornea and retinal degeneration may occur within the first year of life, leading to blindness. Enlarged liver and spleen are common. There is no organ dysfunction, but GAG deposition in these organs may lead to a massive increase in size. Patients may also have diarrhea. Aortic valve disease may occur. Airway obstruction is frequent, usually secondary to abnormal cervical vertebrae. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections can be frequent. Developmental delay may become apparent by age 1-2 years, with a maximum functional age of 2-4 years. Progressive deterioration follows. Most children develop limited language capabilities. Death usually occurs by age 10. Mechanisms Heparan sulfate is one of the GAGs that builds up in the lysosomes of people with Hurler Syndrome The IDUA gene is responsible for encoding an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase. Through hydrolysis, alpha-L- iduronidase is responsible for breaking down a molecule called unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid. This is a uronic acid found in the GAGs dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme is located in lysosomes. Without sufficient enzymatic function, these GAGs cannot be digested properly. Genetics Hurler syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Children with Hurler Syndrome carry two defective copies of the IDUA gene, which has been mapped to the 4p16.3 site on chromosome 4. This is the gene which encodes for the protein iduronidase. , more than 201 different mutations in the IDUA gene have been shown to cause MPS I. Because Hurler syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, affected persons have two nonworking copies of the gene. A person born with one normal copy and one defective copy is called a carrier. They will produce less Œ±-L- iduronidase than an individual with two normal copies of the gene. The reduced production of the enzyme in carriers, however, remains sufficient for normal function; the person should not show any symptoms of the disease. Diagnosis Diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis of one of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who have a family history of the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders. =Classification= All members of the mucopolysaccharidosis family are also lysosomal storage diseases. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is divided into three subtypes based on severity of symptoms. All three types result the absence or decreased functioning of the same enzyme. MPS-IH (Hurler syndrome) is the most severe of the MPS I subtypes. The other two types are MPS-IS (Scheie syndrome) and MPS- IHS (Hurler-Scheie syndrome). Because of the substantial overlap between Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, some sources consider these terms to be outdated. Instead, MPS I may be divided into \\"severe\\" and \\"attenuated\\" forms. Treatment There is currently no cure for Hurler Syndrome. Enzyme replacement therapy with iduronidase (Aldurazyme) may improve pulmonary function and mobility. It can reduce the amount of carbohydrates being improperly stored in organs. Surgical correction of hand and foot deformities may be necessary. Corneal surgery may help alleviate vision problems. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) can be used as treatments for MPS I. BMT from siblings with identical HLA genes and from relatives with similar HLA genes can significantly improve survival, cognitive function, and physical symptoms. Patients can develop graft versus host disease; this is more likely in non- sibling donors. In a 1998 study, children with HLA-identical sibling donors had a 5-year survival of 75%; children with non-sibling donors had a 5-year survival of 53%. Children often lack access to a suitable bone marrow donor. In these cases, UCBT from unrelated donors can increase survival, decrease physical signs of the disease, and improve cognition. Complications from this treatment may include graft versus host disease.  Prognosis  A British study from 2008 found a median estimated life expectancy of 8.7 years for patients with Hurler syndrome. In comparison, the median life expectancy for all forms of MPS type I was 11.6 years. Patients who received successful bone marrow transplants had a 2-year survival rate of 68% and a 10-year survival rate of 64%. Patients who did not receive bone marrow transplants had a significantly reduced lifespan, with a median age of 6.8 years. Epidemiology Hurler syndrome has an overall frequency of one per 100,000. Combined, all of the mucopolysaccharidoses have a frequency of approximately one in every 25,000 births in the United States. Research =Gene therapy= A great deal of interest exists in treating MPS I with gene therapy. In animal models, delivery of the iduronidase gene has been accomplished with retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and plasmid vectors. Mice and dogs with MPS I have been successfully treated with gene therapy. Most vectors can correct the disease in the liver and spleen, and can correct brain effects with a high dosage. Gene therapy has improved survival, neurological, and physical symptoms; however, some animals have developed unexplained liver tumors. If safety issues can be resolved, gene therapy may provide an alternative human treatment for MPS disorders in the future. Sangamo Therapeutics, headquartered in Richmond, California, is currently conducting a clinical trial involving gene editing using Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) for the treatment of MPS I. History In 1919, Gertrud Hurler, a German pediatrician, described a syndrome involving corneal clouding, skeletal abnormalities, and mental retardation. A similar disease of \\"gargoylism\\" had been described in 1917 by Charles A. Hunter. Hurler did not mention Hunter's paper. Because of the communications interruptions caused by World War I, it is likely that she was unaware of his study. Hurler syndrome now refers to MPS IH, while Hunter syndrome refers to MPS II. In 1962, a milder form of MPS I was identified by Scheie, leading to the designation of Scheie syndrome.

Location Located in the central New Territories, it covers a total of . It extends from Lead Mine Pass in the north, to the Shing Mun catchwater road in the south, and from Tai Mo Shan in the west to Grassy Hill and Needle Hill in the east. History As early as 1971, a \\"pilot scheme\\" was initiated and prototype picnic facilities were provided, using funds from Sir David Trench Fund for Recreation. These were well received by visitors. In 1977, the area was formally designated as a country park. Vegetation At the head of the reservoir near the former Tai Wai Village, a \\"fung shui\\" grove contains a rich variety of more than 70 species of trees. It has been designated as a \\"special area\\" that merits special protection. To the west of the reservoir, both sides of the stream known as Tai Shing Shek Kan are covered with a rich variety of shrubs, grasses and trees, including several species of Camellia, Camellia granthamiana, which bears beautiful white flowers more than 12 cm in diameter, is a rare species found only a few decades ago. It is named after a former Hong Kong Governor, Sir Alexander Grantham. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in World War II, most of the trees in the park were cut down. Extensive reforestation was carried out after the war. The main species was Pinus massoniana, whilst Pinus elliottii, Lophostemon confertus, Melaleuca quinquenervia and Acacia confusa were introduced later. The area has now become one of the major forest plantations in Hong Kong. Wildlife As the park is situated close to the densely populated urban area of Tsuen Wan, wildlife is seldom seen. Apart from a few common birds, other animals such as squirrels, barking deer, wild boars and pangolins may occasionally be discovered. Some monkeys, believed to have migrated from nearby Kam Shan Country Park, can sometimes be found along the forest tracks. Geology The land in this area is composed of granitic and volcanic rocks. The latter form the highest ground, while the granitic rocks, which weather relatively easily, form the lower areas in the southern parts of the park. To the east of the park is a rich deposit of wolfram which was first mined in 1936. Mining was interrupted during World War II. With the high post-war prices, mining was resumed in 1951 and continued until 1968 when the prices again fell drastically. The highest average monthly output in the latter period was 30 tonnes, and was entirely for export. There are several abandoned lead mine workings around Lead Mine Pass, some of which date back several centuries. Places to go =Shing Mun Country Park Visitor Centre= The Shing Mun Country Park Visitor Centre, is situated near the maxicab terminus. It provides displays on the origin and history of Shing Mun, the reservoir and the mining industry in the early 20th centuries. Animals and mineral specimens are also on display. Video programmes on Country Parks and Countryside Conservation matters are shown in the visitor centre at regular intervals. =Shing Mun Arboretum= The Shing Mun Arboretum, occupies 14 square kilometres, is situated in the Country Park. It extends to Shing Mun Reservoir Road in the south. The western border lies in Tai Mo Shan, while Grassy Hill and Needle Hill mark the eastern margin. There are 7000 plants, belonging to over 270 species (which are native to Hong Kong or Southern China) in the Arboretum.Botanic Garden Conservation International: Shing Mun Arboretum The plants include a collection of bamboos, protected plant species, plants named after Botanists, plants first discovered in Hong Kong and Camellias found in Hong Kong Countryside, etc. =Other facilities= At the park entrance a large information board and a direction post have been erected, providing visitors with information and guidance. Barbecue facilities are provided throughout the areas to the south and south-east of the reservoir, near the dams. Toilets, a refreshment kiosk, rain-shelters, warden posts, jogging trails, a nature trail, viewcompasses and many other facilities are also provided. Sections 7 and 8 of the MacLehose Trail run through the Park from Smugglers' Ridge in the south-east of the park to Route Twisk in the west. A campsite is provided near Lead Mine Pass for trail hikers. Transportation Visitors are advised to use public transport, as there is no parking space in the park.

The word porphyria originated from the Greek word porphura. Porphura actually means \\"purple pigment\\", which, in suggestion, the color that the body fluid changes when a person has Gunther's disease. It is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting heme, caused by deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen cosynthetase. It is extremely rare, with a prevalence estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 or less. There have been times that prior to birth of a fetus, Gunther's disease has been shown to lead to anemia. In milder cases patients have not presented any symptoms until they have reached adulthood. In Gunther's disease, porphyrins are accumulated in the teeth and bones and an increased amount are seen in the plasma, bone marrow, feces, red blood cells, and urine. Symptoms and signs Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function, severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria. An estimated 30‚Äì40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in <1% of its activity. Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities. Enzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible. Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth, resulting in erythrodontia. When unexpected attacks occur, abdominal pain, as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks. Exposure to the sunlight can cause discomfort and result in blistering, consciousness of heat, and swelling and redness of the skin. =Complications= Photomutilation and transfusion-dependent anemia are common complications. Liver disease is also observed in some cases. It has been reported that early childhood-onset haematological manifestations is a poor prognosis factor.  Causes  inheritance. Gunther disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), located at human chromosome 10q25.2-q26.3. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene is responsible for the disorder and is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. When there is a homozygous mutation it causes a uroporphyrinogen III synthase and uroporphyrinogen cosynthase defect. When the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase is reacting normally it results in the making of isomer III porphyrinogen, which is what is used to form heme. When isomer III porphyrinogen is not produced because of a poor production of uroporphyrinogen III synthase then isomer I porphyrinogen is made which will oxidize and give a reddish tint skin. Diagnosis When diagnosing Congenital Erythroipoetic Porphyria (Gunther Disease) one must exclude other forms of porphyria. These include Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria and rare homozygous variants of Variegate Porphyria, Hereditary Coproporphyria, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). Mild variants may be present similarly to Porphyria Cutanea Tarda. There are 4 steps in establishing the diagnosis of any porphyria. First, a thorough history (particularly family history) and physical exam are performed with special attention paid to sun- exposed skin. Biochemical measurements of porphyrins and precursors in the urine, feces, and blood are necessary. Specialized labs are helpful in measuring activity of specific enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway and/or DNA and mutational analyses. In CEP, activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway) will be markedly decreased. In congenital erythropoietic porphyria, urine aminolavulanic acid and porphobilinogen are typically normal. However, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin tend to be markedly elevated and moderately elevated, respectively, in the urine more than in the feces. Additionally, fecal protoporphyrin is typically mildly elevated. In the red blood cells, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin are all elevated, distinguishing this form of porphyria from the others. Finally, plasma analysis will demonstrate elevated uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. Other nonspecific but helpful diagnostic clues are history of cutaneous photosensitivity, blistering, erosions, crusts and ulcerations leading to extensive scarring and deformation of the hands, loss of eyebrows, eyelashes with severe mutilation of cartilaginous structures like the nose, erythrodontia, and variable degree of hematologic involvement ranging from mild hemolytic anemia to intrauterine hydrops fetalis. Other early clues are red or violet staining of diapers.  Treatment  There are a multiple ways to treat Gunther's diseases, but one of the most crucial things that a person with this disease can do is limit themselves from sun exposure or eliminate sun exposure altogether. There are some sunscreens that have undesirable effects such as tropical sunscreens, but other sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are shown to provide protection due to those light- reflective agents. To block the ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths and get the protection that patients with Gunther's disease require, physical barriers are needed. It is also advised that patients wear protective clothing to block the sun from their skin. Plastic films can be attached to car windows and homes to filter out some of the wavelengths that could cause harm to someone's skin suffering with this disease. Incandescent bulbs replace the normal fluorescent lamps. These bulbs release less light, which prevents the \\"porphyrin-exciting\\" wavelengths that fluorescent lights emit. Other less beneficial treatments have been used to help treat Gunther's disease. These include oral beta-carotene and other treatments such as activated charcoal and cholestyramine, which are used to interrupt and stop the porphyrins from being reabsorbed in the body. The reason that these oral treatments are unreasonable is because they require an extremely large dose of medicine and therefore are not beneficial. Erythrocyte transfusions have been shown to be a successful measure in decreasing the appearance of the disease by trying to lower the erythropoiesis and circulating porphyrin levels. Unfortunately, having chronic erythrocyte transfusions, it can be extremely harmful to the body and can cause severe complications. To help with dry eye symptoms and visual function, topical lubrication can be used. A more invasive way to help treat Gunther's disease would be to have surgery. There have been numerous studies that have stated that bone marrow transplantation is successful. This is a recently new development for Gunther's disease so the long-term effects are still unresourced. If a patient has a life-threatening infectious complication then bone marrow transplantation is no longer relevant for them. There are also reports that stem cell transplantation is successful in a limited number of participants  Eponym  The disorder is named after the German physician who discovered it, Hans Gunther (1884-1956).

Like all X-linked recessive conditions, Menkes disease is more common in males than in females. The disorder was first described by John Hans Menkes in 1962. Onset occurs during infancy, with incidence of about 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 newborns; affected infants often do not live past the age of three years, though there are rare cases in which less severe symptoms emerge later in childhood.  Signs and symptoms  Affected infants may be born prematurely. Signs and symptoms appear during infancy, typically after a two- to three-month period of normal or slightly slowed development that is followed by a loss of early developmental skills and subsequent developmental delay. Patients exhibit hypotonia (weak muscle tone), failure to thrive, hypothermia (subnormal body temperature), sagging facial features, seizures, and metaphyseal widening. Hair appears strikingly peculiar: kinky, colorless or silvery, and brittle. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa or Ehlers-Danlos type 9) is a mild form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints. Cause Mutations in the ATP7A gene, located on chromosome Xq21.1, leads to Menkes syndrome. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. About 30% of MNK cases are due to new mutations and 70% are inherited, almost always from the mother. Even though the disease is more common in males, females can still be a carrier of the disease. As the result of a mutation in the ATP7A gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system such as lysyl oxidase. As with other X-linked disorders, female children of a carrier mother have an even chance of carrying the disorder, but are normally well; male children have an even chance of having the disorder or of being free from it. A genetic counselor may have useful advice. Mechanism Microscopic examination of hair, revealing classical sign of pili torti. The ATP7A gene encodes a transmembrane protein that transport copper across the cell membranes. It is found throughout the body, except for the liver. In the small intestines, the ATP7A protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the protein travels between the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane to maintain copper concentrations in the cell. The protein is normally found in the Golgi apparatus, which is important for modifying proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, ATP7A protein provides copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. One of the enzymes, lysyl oxidase, requires copper for proper function. This enzyme cross-links tropocollagen into strong collagen fibrils. The defective collagen contributes to many of the aforementioned connective tissue manifestations of this disease. If copper levels become excessive, the protein will travel to the cell membrane and eliminate excess copper from the cell. Mutations in the ATP7A gene such as deletions and insertions lead to parts of the gene being deleted, resulting in a shortened ATP7A protein. This prevents the production of a functional ATP7A protein, leading to the impaired absorption of copper from food and copper will not be supplied to certain enzymes. Diagnosis  Menkes syndrome can be diagnosed by blood tests of the copper and ceruloplasmin levels, skin biopsy, and optical microscopic examination of the hair to view characteristic Menkes abnormalities. X-rays of the skull and skeleton are conducted to look for abnormalities in bone formation. Urine homovanillic acid/vanillylmandelic acid ratio has been proposed as a screening tool to support earlier detection. Since 70% of MNK cases are inherited, genetic testing of the mother can be performed to search for a mutation in the ATP7A gene.  Treatment  There is no cure for Menkes disease. Early treatment with injections of copper supplements (acetate or glycinate) may be of some slight benefit. Among 12 newborns who were diagnosed with MNK, 92% were alive at age 4.6. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms includes pain medication, anti-seizure medication, feeding tube when necessary, and physical and occupational therapy. The earlier treatment is given, the better the prognosis. Epidemiology One European study reported a rate of 1 in 254,000; a Japanese study reported a rate of 1 in 357,143. No correlation with other inherited characteristics, or with ethnic origin, is known.

Symptoms  * Abnormal strength and direction of urinary stream * Visible narrow opening at the meatus in boys * Irritation, scarring or swelling of the meatus in boys * Discomfort with urination (dysuria and frequency) * Incontinence (day or night) * Bleeding (hematuria) at end of urination * Urinary tract infections - increased susceptibility due to stricture Causes The protection provided by the foreskin for the glans penis and meatus has been recognized since 1915. In the absence of the foreskin the meatus is exposed to mechanical and chemical irritation from ammoniacal diaper (nappy) that produces blister formation and ulceration of the urethral opening, which eventually gives rise to meatal stenosis (a narrowing of the opening). Published online ahead of print on 22 December 2016. Meatal stenosis may also be caused by ischemia resulting from damage to the frenular artery during circumcision. Risk factors Frisch & Simonsen (2016) carried out a very large-scale study in Denmark, which compared the incidence of meatal stenosis in Muslim males (mostly circumcised) with the incidence of meatal stenosis in ethnic Danish males (mostly non-circumcised). The risk of meatal stenosis in circumcised males was found to be as much 3.7 times higher than in the non-circumcised males. Diagnosis  In boys, history and physical exam is adequate to make the diagnosis. In girls, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) is usually diagnostic. Other tests may include: * Urine analysis * Urine culture * CBC, basic metabolic panel * Renal and bladder ultrasound Prevention =In the newborn= According to Frisch & Simonsen (2016), \\"the foreskin is protective against urinary stricture disease\\" (meatal stenosis). Frisch & Simonsen (2016) call for a \\"thorough reassessment of the burden of urethral troubles and other adverse outcomes after non-therapeutic circumcision of boys.\\" Saeedi et al. (2017) propose long-term follow-up of circumcision with ultrasonography \\"to detect meatal stenosis before permanent renal damage occurs.\\" =After hypospadias repair= Meir & Livne (2004) suggest that use of a broad spectrum antibiotic after hypospadias repair will \\"probably reduce meatal stenosis [rates]\\", while Jayanthi (2003) recommends the use of a modified Snodgrass hypospadias repair. Treatment  In females, meatal stenosis can usually be treated in the physician's office using local anesthesia to numb the area and dilating (widening) the urethral opening with special instruments. In boys, it is treated by a second surgical procedure called meatotomy in which the meatus is crushed with a straight mosquito hemostat and then divided with fine-tipped scissors. Recently, home-dilatation has been shown to be a successful treatment for most boys. Prognosis Most people can expect normal urination after treatment. Incidence  Numerous studies over a long period of time clearly indicate that male circumcision contributes to the development of urethral stricture. Among circumcised males, reported incidence of meatal stricture varies. Griffiths et al. (1985) reported an incidence of 2.8 percent. S√∂rensen & S√∂rensen (1988) reported 0 percent. Cathcart et al. (2006) reported an incidence of 0.55 percent. Yegane et al. (2006) reported an incidence of 0.9 percent. Van Howe (2006) reported an incidence of 7.29 percent. In Van Howe's study, all cases of meatal stenosis were among circumcised boys. Simforoosh et al. (2010) reported an incidence of 0.55 percent. According to Emedicine (2016), the incidence of meatal stenosis runs from 9 to 20 percent. Frisch & Simonsen (2016) placed the incidence at 5 to 20 percent of circumcised boys.

It is used in conjunction with a biomicroscope. The lamp facilitates an examination of the anterior segment and posterior segment of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides a stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. A second, hand-held lens is used to examine the retina. History Two conflicting trends emerged in the development of the slit lamp. One trend originated from clinical research and aimed to apply the increasingly complex and advanced technology of the time.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Carl Zeiss Meditec, AG, p. 33, accessed: February 6, 2011. The second trend originated from ophthalmologic practice and aimed at technical perfection and a restriction to useful methods. The first man credited with developments in this field was Hermann von Helmholtz (1850) when he invented the ophthalmoscope.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 33 In ophthalmology and optometry, the instrument is called a \\"slit lamp\\", although it is more correctly called a \\"slit lamp instrument\\".\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 34 Today's instrument is a combination of two separate developments, the corneal microscope and the slit lamp itself. The first concept of a slit lamp dates back to 1911 credited to Allvar Gullstrand and his \\"large reflection-free ophthalmoscope.\\" The instrument was manufactured by Zeiss and consisted of a special illuminator connected to a small stand base through a vertical adjustable column. The base was able to move freely on a glass plate. The illuminator employed a Nernst glower which was later converted into a slit through a simple optical system.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 35 However, the instrument never received much attention and the term \\"slit lamp\\" did not appear in any literature again until 1914. It wasn't until 1919 that several improvements were made to the Gullstrand slit lamp made by Vogt Henker. First, a mechanical connection was made between lamp and ophthalmoscopic lens. This illumination unit was mounted to the table column with a double articulated arm. The binocular microscope was supported on a small stand and could be moved freely across the tabletop. Later, a cross slide stage was used for this purpose. Vogt introduced Koehler illumination, and the reddish Nernst glower was replaced with the brighter and whiter incandescent lamp. Special mention should be paid to the experiments that followed Henker's improvements in 1919. On his improvements the Nitra lamp was replaced with a carbon arc lamp with a liquid filter. At this time the great importance of color temperature and the luminance of the light source for slit lamp examinations were recognized and the basis created for examinations in red-free light. In the year 1926, the slit lamp instrument was redesigned. The vertical arrangement of the projector made it easy to handle. For the first time, the axis through the patient's eye was fixed along a common swiveling axis, although the instrument still lacked a coordinate cross-slide stage for instrument adjustment. The importance of focal illumination had not yet been fully recognized.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 36 In 1927, stereo cameras were developed and added to the slit lamp to further its use and application. In 1930, Rudolf Theil further developed the slit lamp, encouraged by Hans Goldmann. Horizontal and vertical co-ordinate adjustments were performed with three control elements on the cross-slide stage. The common swivel axis for microscope and illumination system was connected to the cross-slide stage, which allowed it to be brought to any part of the eye to be examined.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 37 A further improvement was made in 1938. A control lever or joystick was used for the first time to allow for horizontal movement. Following World War II the slit lamp was improved again. On this particular improvement the slit projector could be swiveled continuously across the front of the microscope. This was improved again in 1950, when a company named Littmann redesigned the slit lamp. They adopted the joystick control from the Goldmann instrument and the illumination path present in the Comberg instrument. Additionally, Littmann added the stereo telescope system with a common objective magnification changer.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 38 In 1965, the Model 100/16 Slit Lamp was produced based on the slit lamp by Littmann. This was soon followed by the Model 125/16 Slit Lamp in 1972. The only difference between the two models was their operating distances of 100 mm to 125 mm. With the introduction of the photo slit lamp further advancements were possible. In 1976, the development of the Model 110 Slit Lamp and the 210/211 Photo Slit Lamps were an innovation by which each were constructed from standard modules allowing for a wide range of different configurations.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 39 At the same time, halogen lamps replaced the old illumination systems to make them brighter and essentially daylight quality. From 1994 onwards, new slit lamps were introduced which took advantage of new technologies. The last major development was in 1996 in which included the advantages of new slit lamp optics. See also \\"From Lateral Illumination to Slit Lamp - An Outline of Medical History\\".\\"From Lateral Illumination to Slit Lamp - An Outline of Medical History\\", Koppenh√∂fer, Eilhard - online published 2012 General procedure While a patient is seated in the examination chair, they rest their chin and forehead on a support to steady the head. Using the biomicroscope, the ophthalmologist or optometrist then proceeds to examine the patient's eye. A fine strip of paper, stained with fluorescein, a fluorescent dye, may be touched to the side of the eye; this stains the tear film on the surface of the eye to aid examination. The dye is naturally rinsed out of the eye by tears. A subsequent test may involve placing drops in the eye in order to dilate the pupils. The drops take about 15 to 20 minutes to work, after which the examination is repeated, allowing the back of the eye to be examined. Patients will experience some light sensitivity for a few hours after this exam, and the dilating drops may also cause increased pressure in the eye, leading to nausea and pain. Patients who experience serious symptoms are advised to seek medical attention immediately. Adults need no special preparation for the test; however children may need some preparation, depending on age, previous experiences, and level of trust.  Illuminations  Various methods of slitlamp illumination are required to obtain full advantage of slit-lamp biomicroscope. There are mainly six type of illuminating options: # Diffuse illumination, # Direct focal illumination, # Specular reflection, # Transillumination or retroillumination, # Indirect lateral illumination or Indirect proximal illumination and # Sclerotic scatter. Oscillatory Illumination is sometimes considered an illumination technique.Practical Ophthalmology A MANUAL FOR BEGINNING RESIDENTS, Fourth Edition, page 218-228. Observation with an optical section or direct focal illumination is the most frequently applied method of examination with the slit lamp. With this method, the axes of illuminating and viewing path intersect in the area of the anterior eye media to be examined, for example, the individual corneal layers.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 14 = Diffuse illumination = Diffuse Illumination of anterior segment If media, especially that of the cornea, are opaque, optical section images are often impossible depending on severity. In these cases, diffuse illumination may be used to advantage. For this, the slit is opened very wide and a diffuse, attenuated survey illumination is produced by inserting a ground glass screen or diffuser in the illuminating path.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 16 \\"Wide beam\\" illumination is the only type that has the light source set wide open. Its main purpose is to illuminate as much of the eye and its adnexa at once for general observation. = Direct focal illumination = Lesions are seen in superficial layers of cornea by direct focal illumination Observation with an optical section or direct focal illumination is the most frequently applied method. It is achieved by directing a full-height, hairline to medium width, medium-bright beam obliquely into the eye and focusing it on the cornea so that a quadrilateral block of light illuminates the transparent medias of eye. Viewing arm and illuminating arm are kept parfocal. This type of illumination is useful for depth localization. Direct focal illumination is used for grading cells and flare in anterior chamber by shortening height of beam to 2‚Äì1 mm.Practical Ophthalmology A MANUAL FOR BEGINNING RESIDENTS, Fourth Edition, page 220-221. = Specular reflection = Specular reflection, or reflected illumination is just like patches of reflection seen on sunlit lake water surface. To achieve specular reflection, the examiner directs a medium to narrow beam of light (it must be thicker than an optical section) toward the eye from the temporal side. The angle of illumination should be wide (50¬∞-60¬∞) relative to the examiners axis of observation (which should be slightly nasal to the patients visual axis). A bright zone of specular reflection will be evident on the temporal, midperipheral corneal epithelium. It is used to see endothelial outline of cornea.Practical Ophthalmology A MANUAL FOR BEGINNING RESIDENTS, Fourth Edition, page 221-222. = Transillumination or retroillumination = Retro-illumination of anterior subcapsular cataract In certain cases, illumination by optical section does not yield sufficient information or is impossible. This is the case, for example, when larger, extensive zones or spaces of the ocular media are opaque. Then the scattered light that is not very bright normally is absorbed. A similar situation arises when areas behind the crystalline lens are to be observed. In this case the observation beam must pass a number of interfaces that may reflect and attenuate the light. = Indirect illumination = Indirect lateral illumination of corneal ulcer With this method, light enters the eye through a narrow to medium slit (2 to 4 mm) to one side of the area to be examined. The axes of illuminating and viewing path do not intersect at the point of image focus, to achieve this; the illuminating prism is decentered by rotating it about its vertical axis off the normal position. In this way, reflected, indirect light illuminates the area of the anterior chamber or cornea to be examined. The observed corneal area then lies between the incident light section through the cornea and the irradiated area of the iris. Observation is thus against a comparatively dark background.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 17 = Sclerotic scatter or scattering sclero-corneal illumination = Sclerotic scatter illumination showing KP on cornea With this type of illumination, a wide light beam is directed onto the limbal region of the cornea at an extremely low angle of incidence and with a laterally de-centered illuminating prism. Adjustment must allow the light beam to transmit through the corneal parenchymal layers according to the principle of total reflection allowing the interface with the cornea to be brightly illuminated. The magnification should be selected so that the entire cornea can be seen at a glance.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 18 Special techniques = Fundus observation and gonioscopy with the slit lamp = Fundoscopy by using +90 diopter lens with the slit lamp Fundus observation is known by the ophthalmic and the use of fundus cameras. With the slit lamp, however, direct observation of the fundus is impossible due to the refractive power of the ocular media. In other words: the far point of the eye (punctum remotum) is so distant in front of (myopia) or behind (hyperopia) that the microscope cannot be focused. The use of auxiliary optics - generally as a lens ‚Äì makes it possible however to bring the far point within the focusing range of the microscope. For this various auxiliary lenses are in use that range in optical properties and practical application.\\"Eye Examination with the Slit Lamp\\", Zeiss, p. 19 Light filters Most slit-lamp use five light filters. Such as # Unfiltered, # Heat absorption- for increased patient comfort # Grey filter, # Red free- for better visualisation of nerve fibre layer and haemorrhages and blood vessels. # Cobalt blue- after staining with fluorescein dye, for seeing corneal ulcers, contact lens fitting, Seidel's test =Cobalt blue light= Slit lamps produce light of the wavelength 450 to 500 nm, known as \\"cobalt blue\\". This light is specifically useful for looking for problems in the eye once it has been stained with fluorescein. Zeiss Type slit lamp Haag Streit Type slit lamp  Types  There are two distinct slit lamp types based on the location of their illumination system: = Zeiss type = In the Zeiss type slit lamp, the illumination is located below the microscope. This type of slit lamp is named after the manufacturing company Carl Zeiss. = Haag Streit type = In the Haag Streit type slit lamp, the illumination is located above the microscope. This type of slit lamp is named after the manufacturing company Haag Streit. Interpretation The slit lamp exam may detect many diseases of the eye, including: * Cataract * Conjunctivitis * Corneal injury such as corneal ulcer or corneal swelling * Diabetic retinopathy * Fuchs' dystrophy * Keratoconus (Fleischer ring) * Macular degeneration * Retinal detachment * Retinal vessel occlusion * Retinitis pigmentosa * Sj√∂gren's syndrome * Toxoplasmosis * Uveitis * Wilson's disease (Kayser-Fleischer ring) One sign that may be seen in slit lamp examination is a \\"flare\\", which is when the slit-lamp beam is seen in the anterior chamber. This occurs when there is breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier with resultant exudation of protein.Chapter 32 in Classification, Symptoms, and Signs of Uveitis by DEBRA A. GOLDSTEIN and HOWARD H.

As with many other synthetic polymers, it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as Delrin, Kocetal, Ultraform, Celcon, Ramtal, Duracon, Kepital, Polypenco, and Hostaform. POM is characterized by its high strength, hardness and rigidity to ‚àí40 ¬∞C. POM is intrinsically opaque white, due to its high crystalline composition, but it is available in all colors. POM has a density of 1.410‚Äì1.420g/cm3. Typical applications for injection- molded POM include high-performance engineering components such as small gear wheels, eyeglass frames, ball bearings, ski bindings, fasteners, guns, knife handles, and lock systems. The material is widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industry. Development Polyoxymethylene was discovered by Hermann Staudinger, a German chemist who received the 1953 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He had studied the polymerization and structure of POM in the 1920s while researching macromolecules, which he characterized as polymers. Due to problems with thermostability, POM was not commercialized at that time. Around 1952, research chemists at DuPont synthesized a version of POM, and in 1956 the company filed for patent protection of the homopolymer. DuPont credits R. N. MacDonald as the inventor of high-molecular-weight POM.News & Media Relations Home - DuPont EMEA Patents by MacDonald and coworkers describe the preparation of high-molecular-weight hemiacetal-terminated (~O‚àíCH2OH) POM, but these lack sufficient thermal stability to be commercially viable. The inventor of a heat-stable (and therefore useful) POM homopolymer was Stephen Dal Nogare, who discovered that reacting the hemiacetal ends with acetic anhydride converts the readily depolymerizable hemiacetal into a thermally stable, melt-processable plastic. In 1960, DuPont completed construction of a plant to produce its own version of acetal resin, named Delrin, at Parkersburg, West Virginia. Also in 1960, Celanese completed its own research. Shortly thereafter, in a limited partnership with the Frankfurt firm Hoechst AG, a factory was built in Kelsterbach, Hessen; from there, Celcon was produced starting in 1962, with Hostaform joining it a year later. Both remain in production under the auspices of Celanese and are sold as parts of a product group now called 'Hostaform/Celcon POM.  Production  Different manufacturing processes are used to produce the homopolymer and copolymer versions of POM. = Homopolymer = To make polyoxymethylene homopolymer, anhydrous formaldehyde must be generated. The principal method is by reaction of the aqueous formaldehyde with an alcohol to create a hemiformal, dehydration of the hemiformal/water mixture (either by extraction or vacuum distillation) and release of the formaldehyde by heating the hemiformal. The formaldehyde is then polymerized by anionic catalysis, and the resulting polymer stabilized by reaction with acetic anhydride. Due to the manufacturing process, large-diameter cross-sections may have pronounced centerline porosity. A typical example is DuPont's Delrin. =Copolymer = The polyoxymethylene copolymer replaces about 1‚Äì1.5% of the ‚àíCH2O‚àí groups with ‚àíCH2CH2O‚àí. To make polyoxymethylene copolymer, formaldehyde is generally converted to trioxane (specifically 1,3,5-trioxane, also known as trioxin). This is done by acid catalysis (either sulfuric acid or acidic ion-exchange resins) followed by purification of the trioxane by distillation and/or extraction to remove water and other active hydrogen-containing impurities. Typical copolymers are Hostaform from Celanese and Ultraform from BASF. The co-monomer is typically dioxolane, but ethylene oxide can also be used. Dioxolane is formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with aqueous formaldehyde over an acid catalyst. Other diols can also be used. Trioxane and dioxolane are polymerized using an acid catalyst, often boron trifluoride etherate, BF3OEt2. The polymerization can take place in a non-polar solvent (in which case the polymer forms as a slurry) or in neat trioxane (e.g. in an extruder). After polymerization, the acidic catalyst must be deactivated and the polymer stabilized by melt or solution hydrolysis to remove unstable end groups. Stable polymer is melt-compounded, adding thermal and oxidative stabilizers and optionally lubricants and miscellaneous fillers. = Fabrication = POM is supplied in a granulated form and can be formed into the desired shape by applying heat and pressure. The two most common forming methods employed are injection molding and extrusion. Rotational molding and blow molding are also possible. Typical applications for injection-molded POM include high- performance engineering components (e.g. gear wheels, ski bindings, yoyos, fasteners, lock systems). The material is widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industry. There are special grades that offer higher mechanical toughness, stiffness or low-friction/wear properties. POM is commonly extruded as continuous lengths of round or rectangular section. These sections can be cut to length and sold as bar or sheet stock for machining.  Machining  When supplied as extruded bar or sheet, POM may be machined using traditional methods such as turning, milling, drilling etc. These techniques are best employed where production economics do not merit the expense of melt processing. The material is free-cutting, but does require sharp tools with a high clearance angle. The use of soluble cutting lubricant is not necessary, but is recommended. POM sheets can be cut cleanly and accurately using an infrared laser, such as in a CO2 laser cutter. Because the material lacks the rigidity of most metals, care should be taken to use light clamping forces and sufficient support for the work piece. As can be the case with many polymers, machined POM can be dimensionally unstable, especially with parts that have large variations in wall thicknesses. It is recommended that such features be \\"designed-out\\" e.g. by adding fillets or strengthening ribs. Annealing of pre- machined parts before final finishing is an alternative. A rule of thumb is that in general, small components machined in POM suffer from less warping.  Bonding  POM is typically very difficult to bond, with the copolymer typically responding worse to conventional adhesives than the homopolymer. Special processes and treatments have been developed to improve bonding. Typically these processes involve surface etching, flame treatment, using a specific primer/adhesive system, or mechanical abrasion. Typical etching processes involve chromic acid at elevated temperatures. DuPont uses a patented process for treating acetal homopolymer called satinizing that creates a surface roughness sufficient for micromechanical interlocking. There are also processes involving oxygen plasma and corona discharge.BASF Ultraform product information In order to get a high bond strength without specialized tools, treatments, or roughening, one can use Loctite 401 prism adhesive combined with Loctite 770 prism primer to get bond strengths of ~1700psi. Once the surface is prepared, a number of adhesives can be used for bonding. These include epoxies, polyurethanes, and cyanoacrylates. Epoxies have shown shear strength. Cyanoacrylates are useful for bonding to metal, leather, rubber, cotton, and other plastics. Solvent welding is typically unsuccessful on acetal polymers, due to the excellent solvent resistance of acetal. Thermal welding through various methods has been used successfully on both homopolymer and copolymer.  Usage  * Mechanical gears, sliding and guiding elements, housing parts, springs, chains, screws, nuts, fan wheels, pump parts, valve bodies. * Electrical engineering: insulators, bobbins, connectors, parts for electronic devices such as televisions, telephones, etc. * Vehicle: fuel sender unit, light/control stalk/combination switch (including shifter for light, turn signal), power windows, door lock systems, articulated shells. * Model: model railway parts, such as trucks (bogies) and hand rails (handle bars). POM is tougher than ABS, comes in bright translucent colors, and is not paintable. * Hobbies: radio-controlled helicopter main gear, landing skid, yo- yos, vaping drip tips, K'Nex etc. * Medical: insulin pen, metered dose inhalers (MDI). * Food industry: Food and Drug Administration has approved some grades of POM for milk pumps, coffee spigots, filter housings and food conveyors. * Furniture: hardware, locks, handles, hinges., rollers for sliding mechanisms of furnitures * Construction: structural glass - pod holder for point * Packaging: aerosol cans, vehicle tanks. * Sports: paintball accessories. It is often used for machined parts of paintball markers that do not require the strength of aluminium, such as handles and reciprocating bolts. POM is also used in airsoft guns to reduce piston noise. * Longboarding: puck material for slide gloves help the rider touch the road and lean on their hand to slow down, stop, or perform tricks. * Clothing: zippers. * Music: picks, Irish flutes, bagpipes, practice chanters, harpsichord plectra, instrument mouthpieces, tips of some drum sticks. * Dining: fully automatic coffee brewers; knife handles (particularly folding knives). * Horology: mechanical movement parts (e.g. Lemania 5100), watch bracelets (e.g. IWC Porsche Design 3701). * Vapor/e-cigarette accessories: material used in the manufacturing of most \\"Drip Tips\\" (Mouthpiece). * Tobacco products: The BIC Group uses Delrin for their lighters. *Keyboard keycaps: Cherry uses POM for their G80 and G81 series keyboards.  Degradation  Chlorine attack of acetal-resin plumbing joint Acetal resins are sensitive to acid hydrolysis and oxidation by agents such as mineral acid and chlorine. POM homopolymer is also susceptible to alkaline attack and is more susceptible to degradation in hot water. Thus low levels of chlorine in potable water supplies (1‚Äì3 ppm) can be sufficient to cause environmental stress cracking, a problem experienced in both the US and Europe in domestic and commercial water supply systems. Defective mouldings are most sensitive to cracking, but normal mouldings can succumb if the water is hot. Both POM homopolymer and copolymer are stabilized to mitigate these types of degradation. In chemistry applications, although the polymer is often suitable for the majority of glassware work, it can succumb to catastrophic failure. An example of this would be using the polymer clips on hot areas of the glassware (such as a flask-to-column, column-to-head or head-to-condenser joint during distillation). As the polymer is sensitive to both chlorine and acid hydrolysis, it may perform very poorly when exposed to the reactive gases, particularly hydrogen chloride. Failures in this latter instance can occur with seemingly unimportant exposures from well sealed joints and do so without warning and rapidly (the component will split or fall apart). This can be a significant health hazard, as the glass may open or smash. Here, PTFE or a high-grade stainless steel may be a more appropriate choice. In addition, POM can have undesirable characteristics when burned. The flame is not self-extinguishing, shows little to no smoke, and the blue flame can be almost invisible in ambient light. Burning also releases formaldehyde gas, which irritates nose, throat, and eye tissues.

It is located south of Hokitika, and covers an area of about , making it the largest unmodified coastal wetland in New Zealand. It preserves a sequence of vegetation types from mature rimu forest through mƒÅnuka scrub to brackish water that has been lost in much of the rest of the West Coast. ≈åkƒÅrito Lagoon is the main feeding ground for New Zealand's only breeding population of rare white heron. The settlement of ≈åkƒÅrito is at the southern end of the lagoon.  Name  The lagoon's name is from the MƒÅori , place of, and , the young shoots of the bulrush or raup≈ç (Typha orientalis), a valued food source. Another account has ≈åkƒÅrito taking its name from a rangatira named KƒÅrito, whose daughters Mapourika and Wahapako gave their names to nearby Lake Mapourika and Lake Wahapo. The lagoon's official name has been spelled with macrons over the vowels since 2010, although it is still commonly seen written as \\"Okarito\\".  Geography  The lagoon from the south, on ≈åkƒÅrito Trig The lagoon is in area, mostly quite shallow. It is the largest sandbar-built estuarine wetland in the West Coast region ‚Äì and the largest such unmodified wetland in all New Zealand ‚Äì and is roughly in the middle of a series of wetlands that extends for 40 km, between the Wanganui River in the north and the Waiho River in the south. Several small rivers drain into the lagoon, and it is the outflow of Lake Mapourika via the ≈åkƒÅrito River. At the southern end of the lagoon is the small settlement of ≈åkƒÅrito. The lagoon is tidal, with large stretches of mudflat being exposed at low tide, when reliable passage for canoes only possible along a main channel. The channel forks into several streams and creeks that can be used to enter tall coastal kahikatea and rimu rainforest. Most of the lagoon is trackless and muddy and only accessible by boat. Kayaking in the lagoon The lagoon is a dynamic system, driven by seismic activity along the main Alpine Fault. In an earthquake, the estuary floor settles and deepens, but sediment from landslides is also washed down from the mountains, forming dunes and a spit which partly blocks the lagoon off from the sea and raises the shoreline. Tides cannot penetrate as far and a freshwater ecosystem forms, dominated by raup≈ç around the water's edge. Sediment is deposited at the river's mouth as a delta. Over time, the arrival of sediment slows, the spit gets lower and is breached and washed away, the water level lowers, and tides come further inland forming a brackish water ecosystem. During this stage ≈åkƒÅrito's rimu forest is able to encroach around the edges of the now-lower lagoon, a pattern we can observe today.  Flora  Oioi meadow at the ≈åkƒÅrito Wetland Walk; the transition zone of mƒÅnuka scrub to forest can be clearly seen cabbage trees through kahikatea forest to mature rimu forest ≈åkƒÅrito Lagoon has extensive meadows of eelgrass (Zostera muelleri), one of the few remaining estuaries in New Zealand ‚Äì most have been wiped out by pollution and sedimentation after forest clearance. Eelgrass is not a seaweed, but a flowering plant that is pollinated underwater. Eelgrass beds are highly productive, not only drawing nutrients up out of the mid but providing a rich habitat invertebrates and a nursery for baby fishes. On the inland side of the lagoon are large stretches of saltmarsh and swampland, dominated by jointed wire rush or oioi (Apodasmia similis). This becomes a band of mƒÅnuka (Leptospermum scoparium), mingimingi (Coprosma propinqua), and flax (Phormium tenax) shrubland that merges into forest dominated by rimu and silver pine (Manoao colensoi). ≈åkƒÅrito is one of the few places on the West Coast where the transition of tall rain forest through scrub and rush to brackish water can still be easily observed. The transition zone can stretch quite a distance and contain invasive gorse (Ulex europaeus), saltmarsh ribbonwood (Plagianthus divaricatus), and cabbage trees (Cordyline australis), gradually including kahihatea, southern rƒÅtƒÅ, and k≈çwhai (Sophora microphylla) as salinity declines; or it can take place over just a few metres on the bank of a creek.  Fauna  Over 70 bird species have been reported from ≈åkƒÅrito Lagoon and the surrounding forest. Paradise shelducks, New Zealand scaup, black swans, and occasional grey ducks can be seen on the water. Black shags (Phalacrocorax carbo), little shags (P. melanoleucos), pied shags (P. varius), and spotted shags (Stictocarbo punctatus) all occur in the lagoon. Most of the gulls present are the black- billed gull (Chroicocephalus bulleri), the world's most threatened gull species. As well as the common white-faced heron, one can see royal spoonbills and the fabled white heron or k≈çtuku (Ardea alba modesta). Banded dotterels and variable oystercatchers beed on ≈åkƒÅrito Beach. Fernbirds are present all around the lagoon, and perhaps the best place in the world to see this secretive bird is amongst the oioi rushes on the ≈åkƒÅrito Wetland Walk ‚Äì this vegetation is not as good a hiding place as their usual scrub habitat. Pairs can be heard making a call-and-response u-tick call. Australasian bitterns and marsh crakes also inhabit the wetlands but are far harder to spot. The juvenile fishes known as whitebait are common here, and so are whitebaiters during the September‚Äìmid-November season. The lagoon also contains flounder and yellow-eyed mullet. The mudflats are home to tunnelling crabs / papaka (Helice crassa), mudsnails / titiko (Amphibola crenata), and mudflat topshells (Diloma subrostratum).

This subspecies of great egret is quite common throughout Asia and Australia, but in New Zealand the white heron is extremely rare. When Queen Elizabeth II visited New Zealand in 1953‚Äì54, she was compared to the k≈çtuku ‚Äì a compliment given to rare, distinguished visitors. The k≈çtuku is featured on the reverse side of a New Zealand $2 coin. There is only one breeding site for white herons in New Zealand: at the mouth of the Waitangiroto River just to the north of ≈åkƒÅrito Lagoon. K≈çtuku share the colony with the royal spoonbills, known as k≈çtuku ngutupapa. From this colony, k≈çtuku disperse throughout New Zealand, but return to this spot to breed. The first European to see the colony was surveyor Gerhard Mueller, who was guided there by Kere Tutoko in 1865. There were only four nesting pairs of k≈çtuku in 1941 when the land at Waitangiroto was compulsorily acquired by the New Zealand government and gazetted as a nature reserve. White herons can be seen year-round at the ≈åkƒÅrito Lagoon, but are most common between October and March. They can be observed relatively close up while kayaking on the lagoon, and special birdwatching tours can visit the colony from Whataroa.  History  MƒÅori occupation and seasonal harvesting in the area began over 600 years ago. ≈åkƒÅrito was an important mahinga kai (food-gathering site) for KƒÅti MƒÅhaki ki Makaawhio, a subtribe of NgƒÅi Tahu, who were collecting and working pounamu for trade. As part of the 1998 NgƒÅi Tahu Claims Settlement Act, NgƒÅi Tahu were granted a nohoanga (seasonal gathering site) at the lagoon and statutory acknowledgment of their rights over it. In the West Coast Gold Rush of the 1860s, ≈åkƒÅrito rapidly grew to a population of several thousand, with 31 hotels, three banks, and a courthouse. The port was the third busiest on the West Coast after Hokitika and Greymouth, and had a wharf, customs house, and harbour master. At one point 500 prospective gold miners arrived in a single day. Part of the wharf and its shed survive today; the shed was heavily reconstructed in 1960 using parts of the original wharf and shed, and functions as an information centre.

Generally speaking, literary fiction is regarded as having more literary merit than genre fiction, especially the most commercially oriented type of genre fiction. However, the serious study of genre fiction has developed within academia in recent decades.Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, \\"Popular Fiction Studies: The Advantages of a New Field\\". Studies in Popular Culture, Vol. 33, No. 1 (Fall 2010), pp. 21-3 Characteristics Characteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following: *A concern with social commentary, political criticism, or reflection on the human condition. *A focus on \\"introspective, in-depth character studies\\" of \\"interesting, complex and developed\\" characters, whose \\"inner stories\\" drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit \\"emotional involvement\\" in the reader. *A slower pace than popular fiction. As Terrence Rafferty notes, \\"literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way\\". *A concern with the style and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as \\"elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered\\". *Unlike genre fiction plot is not the central concern. *The tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction. Criticism The distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction is sometimes doubtful or controversial, because many works of genre fiction are considered works of literature. Furthermore, major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, as well as Margaret Atwood, also publish science fiction. Doris Lessing described science fiction as \\"some of the best social fiction of our time\\", and called Greg Bear, author of Blood Music, \\"a great writer\\".Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns, interview by Harvey Blume in Boston Book Review A number of major literary figures have also written either genre fiction books, or books that contain certain elements of genre fiction. For instance, the novel Crime and Punishment by Fydor Dostoevsky contains elements of the crime fiction genre.

John Banville publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate Andr√© Gide stated that Georges Simenon, best known as the creator of the fictional detective Jules Maigret, was \\"the most novelistic of novelists in French literature\\".Charles E. Claffey, The Boston Globe September, 10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney. In an interview, John Updike lamented that \\"the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit\\". Likewise, on The Charlie Rose Show, Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because \\"they are written in words\\".The Charlie Rose Show from June 14, 2006 with John Updike  See also  * A Reader's Manifesto * Literary genre * Literature * * Western canon * Postmodern literature References Bibliography Habjan, Jernej, Imlinger, Fabienne.

The church shifted observance of Christ's birth to the birthday of leader Salomon Dialungana, who is believed to be Christ reincarnated. Kimbanguism () is a Christian new religious movement professed by the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His special envoy Simon Kimbangu () founded by Simon Kimbangu in the Belgian Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1921. It is considered a branch of Christianity. A large, independent African-initiated church, it has an estimated 22.5 million believers and has its headquarters in Nkamba.  History  In April 1921, Kimbangu, a Baptist mission catechist, inaugurated a mass movement through his supposed miraculous healings and biblical teaching. His teachings attracted working people, who left jobs to hear him speak about liberation. This threatened the colonial labor structure and thus the Belgian regime. The Belgian authorities treated the faith with suspicion and imprisoned Simon Kimbangu until his death in 1951. The church was formally recognised by the Belgian colonial authorities in 1959. Some smaller, more loosely organised groups in Central Africa regard Kimbangu as God's prophet. =Life and works of Kimbangu= According to the church, Simon Kimbangu is said to have come down to earth from Mount Zion as a Congolese infant. His father had been a traditional religious leader, but both parents died and Kimbangu was orphaned and put in the care of his maternal aunt. She took him to Baptist missionary school where he studied for many years. He grew up to be a Baptist. In 1921, the mother of a deceased child is said to have approached Kimbangu while he was talking to his disciples. He said to her, \\"Have faith in Me. I will give you a miracle and you will know the truth about me. I will do something great for your daughter and you will see God's glory\\", and raised her child from the dead.  Beliefs and practices  Kimbanguist university in Kalamu, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The church eschews politics and embraces Puritan ethics, rejecting the use of violence, polygamy, magic and witchcraft, alcohol, tobacco, and dancing. Its worship is Baptist in form, though the Eucharist was not introduced until 1971. The three key dates in the Kimbanguist calendar are 6 April (marking the date of the start of the ministry of healing), 25 May (marking Christmas, falling on the birthday of Father Dialungana), and 12 October (Kimbangu's death anniversary). The church is largely non-sacramental, with large services that are well-organised. The church also believes that Father Simon Kimbangu is the Holy Spirit, in accordance with John 14:15-17. Like many Christian groups, the Kimbanguists begin and end prayers with the Trinitarian formula. Alongside Simon Kimbangu, the Trinity are Father Kisolokele (first son of Kimbangu) as God the Father, Father Salomon Diangani Dialungana (the reincarnated Jesus and second son of Kimbangu), Father Diangienda Kuntima (last son, reincarnation of Kimbangu and second human form of the Holy Spirit), and Father Simon Kimbangu Kiangani (grandson of Kimbangu, third human form of the Holy Spirit, and current spiritual leader of the Church since 2001).

He played for the Boston Patriots and Miami Dolphins, winning two Super Bowls with the Dolphins. Buoniconti was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001. Early life and family Buoniconti was born to Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti Sr. and Pasqualina \\"Patsy\\" Mercolino in Springfield, Massachusetts. The couple ran a family bakery in the predominantly Italian South End of the city. He was raised Roman Catholic and played football for Cathedral High School, where a plaque honoring him as a \\"Hometown Hall of Famer\\" was unveiled in 2012. In 1985, his son Marc suffered a spinal cord injury making a tackle for The Citadel, rendering him a quadriplegic. Nick became the public face of the group that founded the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, now one of the world's leading neurological research centers. Buoniconti graduated from Notre Dame, and was drafted by the American Football League's Patriots in the 13th round of the 1962 AFL draft. College career In 1960, as a junior, was second on the Fighting Irish in tackles (behind senior captain Myron Pottios) with 71. As a senior in 1961, he led the team with 74 tackles as the Irish co-captain and was rewarded with 2nd-team All-America selections from UPI, TSN, and the Football Coaches' Association. He was the only All-American on Notre Dame's 1961 team. Professional career As a tackle, Buoniconti was the captain of the 1961 Notre Dame football team, but NFL scouts considered him \\"too small\\" to play pro football. Drafted by the Boston Patriots in the 1962 American Football League college draft and switched to linebacker, Buoniconti made an immediate impact, as he was named the team's rookie of the year. The following year, he helped Boston capture the 1963 AFL Eastern Division title. With Boston, he appeared in five AFL All-Star Games, and recorded 24 interceptions, which is still the seventh-most in team history. He was named 2nd team All-AFL in 1963 and the following season began a run of five consensus All-AFL seasons in the following six seasons, missing only 1968 when he was named second-team All-AFL. Buoniconti is a member of the Patriots All-1960s (AFL) Team and the AFL All-Time Team. He was traded to the AFL's Miami Dolphins in 1969. He continued to play well with the Dolphins, in 1969-1974 and 1976, and made the AFL All-Star team in 1969 and the NFL Pro Bowl in 1972 and 1973, when he led the Dolphins in Super Bowl wins. Buoniconti was also named All-AFC in 1972. His leadership made him a cornerstone of the Dolphins' defense. During his years there, the team advanced to three consecutive Super Bowl appearances under Don Shula, the second of which was the team's 1972 undefeated season. In 1973, he recorded a then-team record 162 tackles (91 unassisted). He was named to the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl in 1972 and 1973. Buoniconti ended his career with an unofficial 24 sacks, 18 with the Patriots and six while with the Dolphins. His 32 career interceptions rank him third all-time among NFL linebackers. He was named the Dolphins' Most Valuable Player three times (1969, 1970, 1973). In 1990, he was voted as a linebacker on the Dolphins' Silver Anniversary All- Time team. On November 18, 1991, he was enshrined on the Miami Dolphin's Honor Roll at Hard Rock Stadium. Post-playing career Buoniconti earned a J.D. degree from Suffolk University Law School during his years with the Patriots. He was a practicing attorney for a short time. As an agent, he represented some 30 professional athletes, including baseball players Bucky Dent and Andre Dawson. He was also president of the United States Tobacco Company during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Buoniconti was a leading critic of studies which showed that smokeless tobacco caused cancer of the mouth as well as other types of cancer. In a televised interview on the Comedy Channel toward the end of 1990, when asked his reaction to the last two undefeated teams of the season suffering losses the same Sunday, Buoniconti, indicating his cheerful countenance, told Night After Night's Allan Havey, \\"You know, I think this smile might just stay permanently on my face.\\"Night After Night with Allan Havey, 1989‚Äì93, Comedy Channel/Comedy Central, HBO Downtown Productions Buoniconti also appeared in one of the Miller Lite \\"Do you know me?\\" TV ads, in which he talked about the No-Name Defense. The punch line was a variation on an old joke, with Buoniconti remarking that everyone knows him now. A passerby remarks, \\"Hey, I know you... you're... uh... uh...\\" trying to recall Buoniconti's name. Upon being told that it's Nick Buoniconti, the passerby says, \\"No, that's not it.\\" Buoniconti was a co-host of the HBO series Inside the NFL until 2001. That same year, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Buoniconti is a member of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.

Person-centered therapy seeks to facilitate a client's self-actualizing tendency, \\"an inbuilt proclivity toward growth and fulfillment\\", via acceptance (unconditional positive regard), therapist congruence (genuineness), an empathic understanding. History and influences Person-centered therapy, now considered a founding work in the humanistic school of psychotherapies, began with Carl Rogers, and is recognized as one of the major psychotherapy \\"schools\\" (theoretical orientations), along with psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, classical Adlerian psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, existential therapy, and others. Rogers affirmed individual personal experience as the basis and standard for living and therapeutic effect. This emphasis contrasts with the dispassionate position which may be intended in other therapies, particularly the behavioral therapies. Living in the present rather than the past or future, with organismic trust, naturalistic faith in one's own thoughts and the accuracy in one's feelings, and a responsible acknowledgment of one's freedom, with a view toward participating fully in our world, contributing to other peoples' lives, are hallmarks of Rogers' person-centered therapy. Rogers also claimed that the therapeutic process is essentially the accomplishments made by the client. The client having already progressed further along in their growth and maturation development, only progresses further with the aid of a psychologically favored environment.Rogers, Carl (1951). Client-Centered Therapy. Cambridge Massachusetts: The Riverside Press. Although client-centered therapy has been criticized by behaviorists for lacking structure and by psychoanalysts for actually providing a conditional relationship, it has been shown to be an effective treatment.Cooper, M., Watson, J. C., & Hoeldampf, D. (2010). Person-centered and experiential therapies work: A review of the research on counseling, psychotherapy and related practices. Ross-on-Wye, UK: PCCS Books.  The necessary and sufficient conditions  Rogers (1957; 1959) stated that there are six necessary and sufficient conditions required for therapeutic change: # Therapist‚Äìclient psychological contact: a relationship between client and therapist must exist, and it must be a relationship in which each person's perception of the other is important. # Client incongruence: that in- congruence exists between the client's experience and awareness. # Therapist congruence, or genuineness: the therapist is congruent within the therapeutic relationship. The therapist is deeply involved‚Äîthey are not \\"acting\\"‚Äîand they can draw on their own experiences (self-disclosure) to facilitate the relationship. # Therapist unconditional positive regard: the therapist accepts the client unconditionally, without judgment, disapproval or approval. This facilitates increased self-regard in the client, as they can begin to become aware of experiences in which their view of self-worth was distorted or denied. # Therapist empathic understanding: the therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's internal frame of reference. Accurate empathy on the part of the therapist helps the client believe the therapist's unconditional regard for them. # Client perception: that the client perceives, to at least a minimal degree, the therapist's unconditional positive regard and empathic understanding. =Core conditions= It is believed that the most important factor in successful therapy is the relational climate created by the therapist's attitude to their client. The therapist's attitude is defined by the three conditions focused on the therapist, which are often called the core conditions (3,4, and 5 of the six conditions): # Congruence: the willingness to transparently relate to clients without hiding behind a professional or personal facade. # Unconditional positive regard: the therapist offers an acceptance and prizing for their client for who he or she is without conveying disapproving feelings, actions or characteristics and demonstrating a willingness to attentively listen without interruption, judgement or giving advice. # Empathy: the therapist communicates their desire to understand and appreciate their client's perspective. Processes Rogers believed that a therapist who embodies the three critical and reflexive attitudes (the three core conditions) will help liberate their client to more confidently express their true feelings without fear of judgement. To achieve this, the client-centred therapist carefully avoids directly challenging their client's way of communicating themselves in the session in order to enable a deeper exploration of the issues most intimate to them and free from external referencing.\\"Person-centered therapy\\" on the Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders website Rogers was not prescriptive in telling his clients what to do, but believed that the answers to the clients' questions were within the client and not the therapist. Accordingly, the therapists' role was to create a facilitative, empathic environment wherein the client could discover the answers for him or herself.

Pitt Island's Kahuitara Point is the first populated location on earth to observe a sunrise in each new year, based on local time zone. History Pitt Island was originally inhabited by the Moriori, the indigenous peoples of the Chatham Islands, who called it Rangiaotea or Rangihaute. Their archaeological remains are found almost everywhere on the island; large quantities of artefacts are constantly coming to light.King 2000. No remains of momori rakau are visible on the island, but there are records of them once being present.King 2000 The first Europeans to see and name Chatham Island were the crew of William Robert Broughton's ship . However, they did not see Pitt Island. The first to do so was Captain Charles Johnston on in May 1807. He named it 'Pitt's Island' after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. In 1840, the name was simplified to \\"Pitt\\" Island. Taranaki Maori who invaded the Chatham Islands in 1835 called it Rangiauria, a name which is still in use today.

He was the younger brother of Felice Anerio. Giovanni's principal importance in music history was his contribution to the early development of the oratorio; he represented the progressive trend within the otherwise conservative Roman School, though he also shared some of the stylistic tendencies of his brother, who was much indebted to Palestrina. Life He was born in Rome on 7 July 1569.Fabrizio Mastroianni, \\"Ritrovata la data di nascita di Giovanni Francesco Anerio\\", in Tra musica e storia. Saggi di varia umanit√† in ricordo di Saverio Franchi, ed. by Giancarlo Rostirolla and Elena Zomparelli, Rome, Ibimus, 2007, p. 159. He was a choirboy at Cappella Giulia in St. Peter's under Palestrina from 1575 to 1579. He clearly decided to become a priest from an early age, and became associated with the Oratory of Filippo Neri around 1583. In 1595 he was employed as an organist at S Marcello, and likely became maestro di cappella at the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, after Francesco Soriano, between 1600 or 1601 and 1603. In 1609 he held a similar post at Verona Cathedral, his first appointment outside of Rome; he stayed there until 1610, when he went back to Rome; and he stayed there, aside for a few travels, until 1624, in a variety of roles (becoming a priest at last in 1616). In 1624 he took the position of choirmaster to King Sigismund III of Poland in Warsaw. Poland had several active musical centers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, including Krak√≥w and Warsaw, and often employed Italians and Germans; Anerio was one of the more distinguished foreigners to take up residence there. Unfortunately he never saw Rome again; he died while traveling back home, while in Graz, Austria, and was buried there on 12 June 1630. Musical style Giovanni Anerio was a much more progressive composer than his brother, and in the conservative environment of Rome in the early 17th century, this was progressive indeed. Many of his madrigals were monodies, borrowing a style which came from Florence and other locations to the north; his motets and masses, on the other hand, are conservative and use the Palestrina style, though the motets include figured bass, another innovation from the first decade of the 17th century. Some influence from Viadana is evident in these pieces. Some of his masses are polychoral, a technique which involved multiple, spatially separated groups of singers. While this was also a technique which developed in Venice, it was widespread by the end of the 16th century: almost all composers of sacred polyphony used polychoral techniques at some time, especially those working in large acoustical environments (such as most cathedrals in Europe). The most important achievement of the younger Anerio, however, was his Teatro armonico spirituale of 1619, which is arguably the first oratorio. It includes the earliest surviving obbligato writing for instruments by the Roman School. Instrumentation is indicated with unusual care, and the alternate instrumental and vocal passages were greatly influential in works of the following decades. Unlike the works of the Venetian school, many of which were essentially grandiose motets, the Teatro armonico spirituale was in Italian; it included stories told musically but not acted (as would be done in opera); and voices and instruments alternated movement by movement. The piece included settings of the tale of the Prodigal Son and the Conversion of Saul. Works Anerio was a prolific composer, and he wrote motets, litanies, antiphons, \\"sacred concertos,\\" responsories, psalms, madrigals, much miscellaneous sacred and secular music, as well as a handful of instrumental pieces. Most were published in Rome; many fewer works from his Polish period seem to have been preserved, although two polychoral Masses found in manuscript (one for three choirs) can be attributed to this last phase of his career.Daniele V.

It consists of the Queen, represented by the Governor of Victoria, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. It has a fused executive drawn from members of both chambers. The parliament meets at Parliament House in the state capital Melbourne. The current Parliament was elected on 24 November 2018, sworn in on 19 December 2018 and is the 59th parliament in Victoria.59TH PARLIAMENT OFFICIALLY OPENED The two Houses of Parliament have 128 members in total, 88 in the Legislative Assembly (lower house) and 40 in the Legislative Council (upper house). Victoria has compulsory voting and uses preferential voting in single-member seats for the Legislative Assembly, and single transferable vote in multi-member seats for the proportionally represented Legislative Council. The Council is described as a house of review. Majorities in the Legislative Council are rare, so the government of the day must negotiate with other parties to pass much of its legislative agenda. All members serve four-year terms. The parliament's functions and processes have evolved over time, undergoing significant changes as Victoria changed from an independent colony to a state within the federated Australia. The Parliament may make laws for any matter within Victoria, subject to the Victorian Constitution. Its power is further limited by the ability for the federal government to override it in some circumstances, subject to the Australian Constitution. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Victoria provides judicial oversight of Parliament and is vested with equal power. The parliament is also vested with other powers, such as the means to investigate matters, conduct research and summon witnesses. Government is formed by the party or parties who command confidence and supply within the Assembly. The leader of the governing party or parties is the Premier, the most senior elected member of Victoria's executive government. Victorians do not directly elect the Premier, and the leader of the majority party is appointed Premier by the Governor. The Labor Party has held a majority in the Assembly since the 2014 election and formed government. It was re-elected at the 2018 election. Daniel Andrews has been the Premier since 2014. History =Location= Parliament has sat at Parliament House, Melbourne since 1856, with the exception of the period 1901‚Äì1927, when Parliament House was used by the Federal Parliament and the Parliament of Victoria sat at the Royal Exhibition Building. The building has undergone significant renovations since its initial construction as it has been expanded, repaired and restored over time. The first major works were conducted in the 1930s, using a 50,000 pound sterling contribution from the Australian federal government paid in gratitude for the use of the building. Further construction was undertaken throughout the 1970s to make \\"temporary\\" offices for members of Parliament, although these were not modernised until further works began in 2015. Sections of the structure's outer walls have gradually been replaced over time. =Early parliamentary history= Prior to 1851 the area of Australia now known as Victoria was part of the colony of New South Wales and was administered by the Government of New South Wales in Sydney. On 5 August 1850, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Australian Colonies Government Act which made provision for the separation of Victoria from New South Wales. Enabling legislation was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, and Victoria was formally created a separate colony of the United Kingdom on 1 July 1851. The Australian Colonies Government Act provided for the colony to be administered by a Lieutenant- Governor and a Legislative Council of 51 members, 21 of which were to be elected and the remainder appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate in some matters to the Governor of New South Wales, who was given the title Governor-General. The Legislative Council met for the first time in November 1851 at St Patrick's Hall, Melbourne. The first Legislative Council existed for five years and was responsible for at least three significant and enduring contributions to the parliamentary system of Victoria: drafting the first Constitution of Victoria, ensuring a secret ballot within elections (a novelty within the British Empire at the time), and ordering the construction of Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne. The Victorian Constitution was approved by the Legislative Council in March 1854, was sent to Britain where it was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the Victoria Constitution Act 1855, was granted Royal Assent on 16 July 1855 and was proclaimed in Victoria on 23 November 1855. The constitution established the Westminster-style system of responsible government that continues in Victoria today. It further stipulated several preconditions on voting that have since been rescinded such as restricting voting to only men of at least 21 years of age who met minimum wealth standards. Rural districts were also very over-represented in order to favour large landowners. The election for the first Victorian Parliament was held during the spring of 1856, the first Victorian Members of Parliament met on 21 November 1856 in the recently completed Parliament House and were sworn in, and on 25 November 1856 the first Victorian Parliament was officially opened by Acting Governor Major- General Edward Macarthur. The Legislative Council consisted of thirty members representing six Provinces, each province returning five Members. The Legislative Assembly consisted of sixty members representing thirty-seven multi and single-member electorates. =Expansion of suffrage= Although the White Australia policy denied the vote to Indigenous Australians in some states, Victoria did not directly legislate voting based on race. Therefore, Indigenous Victorian men were entitled to vote from 1857, provided they met the other requirements. Furthermore, Indigenous Victorians who enrolled to vote in Victoria were allowed to vote in federal elections from 1901. Voting was initially restricted based on gender, though. Victoria was the last state within Australia to intentionally recognise female voters. The Electoral Act 1863 granted the vote to all rate payers, which included some women at the time. Therefore women were legally allowed to, and indeed did, vote in the election of 1864. The act was clarified in 1865 to exclude women. Agitation for allowing women to vote began in earnest in 1891, with presentation of an immense petition containing over 30,000 signatures was presented to the parliament. This petition was proudly used as a promotional tool for the federation of Australia. The newly federated nation allowed women to vote in elections, as well as stand for office, since 1902. Yet Victoria did not expand its suffrage to include women until 1908, nor allow women to stand for office until 1924. The first woman was not elected into the Victorian Parliament until 1933. Political parties began to increase in size and influence throughout the 1890s, leading to further agitation for changes to the vote. This also led to voting within each chamber becoming more predictable, as strong party discipline began to form among party members, mostly aligned to three broad ideals: the labour movement, liberal movement and rural interests. Victoria's two-party system took hold, usually as a contest between the Labor Party and a coalition formed by the Country Party (now known as the Nationals) and the more recent Liberal Party. The principle of ensuring that rural regions, which typically represented the landed gentry when Victoria first formed, were over-represented in parliament was also rescinded. One-man-one vote was adopted in 1899 in the Legislative Assembly, and expanded to the Legislative Council in 1937. Wealth requirements for voting in the Legislative Assembly were removed in 1857, but this reform was not made to the Legislative Council until 1950. Furthermore, the method of voting was changed; first-past-the-post voting was replaced with preferential voting for the Legislative Assembly in 1911 and compulsory voting introduced in 1923. Meanwhile, the preferential voting was used for elections to the Legislative Council from 1921, and elections made compulsory in 1935. Voting was further expanded in 1973, when the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. The minimum age for membership of either house was also lowered to 18. =Expansion of voting divisions= The number of divisions within each of the chambers was gradually increased over time. The Legislative Council was expanded from 30 members representing 6 provinces to its peak of 48 members spread throughout 14 provinces by 1888. The number of both provinces and members continued to change until it remained relatively fixed by 1974, when 44 members represented 22 provinces. Furthermore, the members were distributed evenly, rather than a mixture of single and multi-member districts as the chamber was at its creation. The Legislative Assembly has similarly fluctuated in size over time. It contained 60 seats within its first iteration in 1856, eventually growing to as many as 95 by 1900. It was not until 1958 when all divisions were up for election at the same time, though, when all of the then 66 seats were contested. The Assembly reached 88 seats in 1985 and has remained at this number ever since. =Current voting methods and districts= Until November 2006, the Legislative Council had 44 members serving eight-year terms, elected from single-member constituencies, with half the seats falling vacant every four years. Since then it has had 40 members, each serving four- year terms. They are elected from eight multi-member constituencies, each returning five members, and elected by proportional representation. Since 2006, the Legislative Assembly has had 88 members elected for fixed four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting. Fixed four-year terms were introduced for both houses in 2002, replacing the previous provision that allowed the government to expire after no more than three years. Composition and electoral systems Parliament consists of two chambers: the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. It is overseen by the Governor, on behalf of the Monarch. All members of both houses are elected for fixed four-year terms. General elections are held on the last Saturday in November every four years with the parliament expiring on the Tuesday twenty-five days before the election. The most recent general election was held on 24 November 2018. Parliament can be dissolved earlier by the Governor, and a general election called, in two exceptional circumstances: * the Legislative Assembly passes a motion of no confidence in the Government or its ministers, or * the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly are deadlocked and cannot agree to pass a Bill. Anyone enrolled to vote in Victoria can stand for election as a candidate for either House, except for: * a judge of the Victorian Courts, * a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, * an undischarged bankrupt, or * someone convicted of a serious criminal offence. It is also not permitted to be a member of both houses or a candidate for election to both houses of Parliament. Members of Parliament may be addressed by their name or by using their electorate, for example \\"The Member for Hawthorn\\" or \\"Member for Southern Metropolitan Region\\", and are entitled to the postnominal letters MLC if a Member of the Legislative Council, and MLA or MP if a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Ministers and former ministers are entitled to the style \\"The Honourable\\" (abbreviated to \\"The Hon\\") although some choose not to use it. The government of the day sits on benches to the right of the presiding officer within each chamber, while the opposition sits to the left. Members of a house who are not part of either the official government or opposition sit on the benches in between them, called the cross bench. This arrangement is used in the Legislative Council even though the governing parties rarely command a majority within it. The Government and Opposition appoint members as Managers of Government and Opposition Business in each house. These members are not within the control of the house in the same way that the President and Speaker are, they are appointed by the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition respectively. Each party represented in each house appoints a member as their Party Whip. The whip's main duty is to ensure that all of the members of their party are present within a chamber when a formal vote takes place. =Legislative Assembly= Victorian Legislative Assembly The Legislative Assembly is the house of responsible government, in that the government of the day must command a majority of support in this chamber. Furthermore, the Premier and Ministers are accountable to Parliament and must face questioning and scrutiny from Parliament. The Assembly schedules question time and has time and subject limits on the ways that Ministers must respond to matters raised to them by any other member of the Assembly. It consists of eighty-eight members who are elected for four-year terms using instant run-off preferential voting. Casual vacancies in the Assembly are filled by a by-election within the electorate. The Assembly functions as a representation of Victoria and commanding a majority within the Assembly provides a mandate for government policies. The Assembly is the only chamber authorised to draw funds from the public treasury, or to raise taxes, on its own initiative. Changes to taxation or funding for projects can still be blocked by the Council, but the Assembly may always authorise funding for the ordinary operation of government without needing Council approval. This means that, unlike the Australian Senate, the other chamber of Victoria's parliament cannot block supply for government funding. The Assembly has increased in power over time compared to the Legislative Council. It is assumed that the government of the day will act upon the initiatives it campaigned on and the Assembly serves as a direct link between local members and each individual constituency. Furthermore, while it is not a requirement that ministers come from the Assembly, it is convention that more members of the executive branch sit within the Assembly than the Council. Most bills originate within the Assembly, partly as a matter of convention and mostly due to the fact that bills not sponsored by the government are unlikely to be passed. A bill typically goes through three readings, each followed by a vote, before being presented to the Legislative Council. =Legislative Council= Victorian Legislative Council The Legislative Council is the house of review. It contains forty members, elected from eight multi-member electorates known as regions. Each region returns five members for a four year term. Each region contains eleven divisions from the Legislative Assembly. The Council is elected using a single transferable vote with the option of group voting tickets. Casual vacancies are filled by a joint-sitting of both houses. The new member must be from the same party as the original member was at the time of their election. The Council's power has decreased over time, as its role has changed. It was initially a means of suppressing democratic reforms, particularly since the more representative Assembly was seen as too \\"liberal\\" and \\"radical\\". It now serves as a house of review, more closely modelled on the Australian Senate than on the United Kingdom's House of Lords. Majorities within the Council are rare by design, while minority interest groups are more likely to be elected than within the Assembly, encouraging debate and compromise. The Governor's opening address to Parliament occurs in the Council. The governor does not enter the Assembly, in keeping with the Westminster tradition of regal and vice-regal persons not entering into the chamber modelled on the House of Commons. Bills passed by the Assembly must also pass the Council within the same form. Either house can propose amendments to bills and all bills, with the exception of supply bills, must pass both houses. =Presiding officers= The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly is the presiding officer of the Legislative Assembly. He or she is an elected member of the parliament and is chosen by the members of the Legislative Assembly to chair their meetings and represent the assembly as a whole at official functions. The corresponding person in the Legislative Council is the President of the Legislative Council. Both the Speaker and the President have important powers in controlling debate in their respective chambers, including the ability to punish members who step out of line or disobey their orders. The presiding officers also have powers to summon witnesses to the chamber to assist in the legislative role of Parliament. The presiding officers also oversee votes within their respective chambers and provide proof of assent in the instance that a bill is passed. This proof is needed for a bill to be presented to the Governor for royal assent. The presiding officers' voting roles are different. The Speaker of the Assembly only has a casting vote, while the President of the Council only has a deliberative vote. The speaker may therefore only vote when a matter is tied, with their casting vote determining the outcome. This is consistent with the Westminster tradition of the speaker acting as an impartial arbiter. Some pieces of legislation, such as altering the Constitution, require an absolute majority (45 of the 88 possible votes) to pass. It is therefore mathematically impossible for a speaker to pass such legislation with their casting vote, as the largest possible tied vote is 43:43. The President used to have the same power, but their role has changed over time. Consequently, the President now has a deliberative vote but not a casting vote. This is modelled on the Australian Senate and ensures that a region of Victoria would not be deprived of one of its five votes. A tied vote in the Council is considered to have failed to pass regardless of how the President cast their vote. The President does not need to move to one end of the chamber during a division, but instead advises the clerk which way they are voting. Parliamentary Committees Knight Kerr Room, often used by Parliamentary Committees Committees are made of members of either house. They have a specifically defined role designed to seek community input about ideas or to investigate matters Parliament deems important. The membership of a committee is determined by the parliament, usually as a new parliament begins. Each committee contains members of many political parties, not just the governing parties, although the government still generally aims to give itself functional majorities within each committee. Lobbyists, members of the public and organisations communicate with committees in order to give input into the drafting of bills. The Parliament of Victoria outlines the committee process as: # Terms of reference # Calling for submissions # Public hearings # Research # Reporting to Parliament # Government response The government will usually be given six months to respond to the committee's recommendations. As they need as broad an understanding as possible of the issues at hand, committees may perform inquiries with the authority to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. This assists with research and is a means of holding parties to account. Committees have broad powers when performing inquiries although there are some legal protections in place for witnesses, similar to those for witnesses in the judicial system. The different types of committees are: joint investigatory committees, comprising members of both houses, standing committees, comprising members of the Legislative Council, select committees, comprising members of one house or the other, and domestic committees, which are generally closed to the public as they concern matters of the parliament itself. Parliament's current committees are: = Joint committees = * Dispute Resolution * Electoral Oversight * Integrity and Oversight * Public Accounts and Estimates * Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations = Legislative Council committees = * Economy and Infrastructure * Environment and Planning * Legal and Social Issues * Privileges * Procedure = Legislative Assembly committees = * Economy and Infrastructure * Environment and Planning * Legal and Social Issues * Privileges * Procedure Procedure Parliamentary days follow a regular routine. Each sitting day begins with a prayer, and also an acknowledgement to country in respect to Victoria's Indigenous people. A quorum must be present for a day's proceedings to be legally binding, so the presiding officer will generally wait until enough members are within the chamber before entering. Members may only speak in the chamber when given leave to do so by the presiding officer. A proposed petition, motion or bill can be introduced into either house, but in practice most are introduced into the Legislative Assembly. Any statute bill, with the exception of bills appropriating money for the ordinary annual services of government, must be passed by both Houses before being presented to the Governor, who will sign the Bill into law on behalf of the Queen. Ordinary appropriation bills need only be passed by the Legislative Assembly before being presented to the Governor for royal assent. The parliamentary process extends beyond each chamber in turn. Proposed bills and motions will usually be passed separately within their party caucus before they are brought to Parliament. The governing party or parties will also generally only propose bills that have the approval of the relevant minister, and which have already been agreed upon during a cabinet meeting. Cabinet members have large flexibility in drafting bills. They are nonetheless limited by policies that require them to propose bills only within their specific portfolios, and to only allow amendments to existing bills that are relevant to the bill in question.title=The Cabinet Handbook url=https://www.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-01/the-cabinet- handbook.pdf date=January 2019 author=Government of Victoria accessdate=19 March 2020 Input is sought from various public groups, private interests and public servants. =Committee process= As a general rule, official government policy is based on advice given by a committee. This ensures further public input as committees consist of members from many parties. Bills are then drafted by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that all relevant clauses and technicalities in existing laws are covered. Any member, whether in government or otherwise, may draft their own bill. Bills are almost always tabled to Parliament by a minister; any bills proposed by someone other than a Cabinet member are referred to as a private member's bill. Any private member's bill is usually drafted by the member in question without input from the OCPC. =Debate and vote= The presiding officer of a house determines when a bill, motion or petition is tabled by adding it to the Notice Paper for a given sitting day. Members must provide notice so that enough time is available to allow for proper debate and scrutiny. The presiding officer will also schedule subsequent readings based on how each house votes; if the bill is passed on its second reading, then it is common to provide for two weeks before the next. A bill usually goes through three readings once it is tabled in a house. The bill's details remain confidential except to parliament, other than the title, during the first reading to the house from which it originated. Members have a chance to read and analyse the bill at their leisure. It goes to a second reading if the house moves to do so. The Assembly refers to this as Consideration in Detail whereas it is called Committee of the Whole in the Council. Debates occur at this stage, as members of the house may scrutinise the bill's merits, propose amendments or move that the bill be dismissed altogether. The bill will be read clause by clause, allowing for all technicalities and edge cases to be discussed. The house will often vote on amendments at this stage as a result of debate and discussion. Any proposed amendments to bills under debate must be relevant. Some bills, such as those that continue routine matters of governance or that do not face opposition, may skip this stage by a unanimous vote. Finally, the house may then go to a third reading, typically two weeks after debate is adjourned following the second reading. The bill is read in full in its final form to ensure that all members can scrutinise the final bill and its amendments (if any). The house's formal vote after the third reading passes the bill in that house and the presiding officer certifies it. This process must occur in both houses for a bill to become law. Voting in the house can be either be passed by the presiding officer simply asking members to call out their assent by stating, \\"Aye,\\" or dissent by stating, \\"No.\\" They then decide which side wins based on the volume. This process of voting \\"on the voices\\" is common for matters with little opposition. However, any member may challenge the presiding officer's ruling and ask for a division. This leads to bells being rung and members either stand to the presiding officer's right if they assent or to the left if they dissent. A count is conducted and a record of how each member voted is taken. If a house amends the draft bill, then the other house must separately agree to the same amendments. This means that it is returned to the other chamber for another vote. The bill is usually not read out in full again, rather only the amendment in question. =Royal Assent= Once both houses agree to the bill, and both presiding officers have certified the votes, it is presented to the Governor. The Governor provides royal assent on behalf of the Crown, after which the bill with either take effect immediately, or at a time specified in the bill. The Governor may, to the letter of the law, withhold their approval of a bill. However, their capacity to do so is not unlimited and is heavily curtailed by precedent and convention. In the rare instances where the Governor is reluctant to provide Royal Assent, the bill may be sent back to the house of origin with suggested amendments rather than be rejected outright. Functions The parliament has the power to make laws for Victoria on any matter, subject only to limitations placed on it by the Constitution of Australia, which specifies which matters fall under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Constitution identifies three areas of legislative power: exclusive powers, which may only be exercised by the federal parliament, concurrent powers, where may be exercised by both the states or federal parliament, and residual powers which remain the exclusive prerogative of state parliaments. Concurrent powers are limited further, as when a state law and federal law come into conflict, the federal law prevails to the extent of any inconsistency. Exclusive powers deal with matters that affect the entire nation or anything occurring on federal land. For instance, no state may create its own currency, nor raise its own defence force. However, the federal parliament may only make laws for matters to which it has been specifically granted the ability to do so by Australia's Constitution. Therefore the remaining powers remain the legal domain of each state parliament in turn. The Treasury Corporation of Victoria outlines that the Victorian Parliament's key responsibilities are: \\"education, public health, police and justice, transport, roads and railways, industry, mining and agriculture, public works, ports, forestry, electricity, gas, and water supply and irrigation.\\" The parliament may levy its own taxes, however, income taxes have been the exclusive domain of the federal government for decades. The state government's chief means of revenue (outside of grants from the federal government) comes from a combination of payroll taxes, stamp duties on housing and vehicles and a portion of the goods and services tax that is divided amongst all states. The Victorian Government may never levy new taxes, nor spend funds unless it has been specifically authorised to do so by the parliament. It may spend funds raised by taxes from the federal government, although such spending must still be approved by the Victorian Parliament. Victoria has deferred its powers to the federal parliament over time as Australia has concentrated power into its federal government. This is most often done with the practice of \\"tied grants\\", whereby the federal government funds projects that are administered at a state level, such as road and rail, but these grants are only given on the condition that the Victorian Parliament also assents to preconditions laid out by its federal counterpart. The Parliament of Victoria is a bicameral legislature. It usually fulfils its legislative role by first proposing bills in the Legislative Assembly, and then reviewing them in the Legislative Council. Common practice is that the houses sit in staggered dates; the Assembly usually meeting first in order to pass bills that the Council later debates. These houses sit in separate chambers. The parliament also has the ability to amend Victoria's constitution, although this power is subject to strict requirements. All sections must be passed by an absolute majority of each house (currently 45 in the Assembly and 21 in the Council), regardless of how many members are present in the chamber. Alterations to Victoria's Constitution made in 2003 stipulate that some sections may not be modified without a three-fifths majority of both houses, while others may not be amended without a public referendum. However, since neither of these requirements were themselves passed by such majorities it is unlikely that the clauses could not simply be removed by an absolute majority in both chambers at a later date. Parliament undertakes investigative and research roles. Each house has a number of committees that investigate proposed laws in detail before they are considered by the whole house. They may be formed for research purposes or to seek community input. This function is assisted by the fact that committees include members of more than one political party. Some of the committee work is carried out by the Joint Committees which consist of members from all sides of politics and from both chambers. Like the parliament, the committees cease to exist when the parliament is dissolved by the governor, and need to be recreated after each general election. This means that often the names and jurisdiction of the committees are changed. The houses provide oversight of the government of the day. Committees may also investigate the effectiveness of existing laws and regulations. Similarly, parliamentary committees may also investigate potential breaches of law or conventions by the government. General practice is that committees are given two weeks to investigate potential impacts on the wider community any bill may have as part of a bill's second reading within a house. Conflict between the Houses The Victorian Parliament‚Äôs means of resolving disputes between the two houses entails a process modelled on the Australian Parliament‚Äôs. However, the process also includes additional steps and modifications. A bill that is passed by the Assembly but rejected by the Council, termed a \\"Disputed Bill\\" may be amended by the Council and returned to the Assembly within 2 months. If the Assembly does not endorse the amendments then a dispute resolution committee may be formed. This process does not apply to ordinary appropriation bills, which need only pass the Legislative Assembly. The committee must consist of 7 members from the Assembly and 5 from the Council, each appointed by their respective house. This committee is often formed following an election in anticipation of its usage later. The committee is given 30 days to resolve the dispute in secret and then present their compromise bill to Parliament. If the committee either cannot reach an agreement, or the parliament does not pass the committee‚Äôs suggestion, then the bill is termed a \\"Deadlocked Bill.\\" At this point, the Premier may advise for a fresh election of the Assembly (and only the Assembly), after which the bill may then go before a joint sitting of both houses. A Deadlocked Bill would likely pass a joint sitting, due to the fact that the Assembly is more than twice the size of the Council. Such a bill is treated as though it has passed both houses in the normal fashion. Relationship with government Parliament functions as the legislative branch of the Victorian government. It passes laws or amends existing laws to assist in the governance of the state on behalf the Victorian people, to whom Parliament is answerable through elections. Victoria uses a blend of statutory law and common law. The parliament makes statutory law while common law is decided by the judicial branch of government. The government follows the Westminster tradition of having an executive government whose members come from an elected legislature, a fact that is enshrined in Victorian law. Parliament holds de facto power over other branches of Victoria's government due to its exclusive power to appropriate funds for any government business. This is why holding confidence of supply within the Assembly is crucial to any party's ability to govern; loss of funds could prevent any government business. Parliament's ability to scrutinise government business is assisted by independent arbiters such as the auditor-general and ombudsman. Parliament has specifically legislated for these positions, known as \\"Officers of Parliament\\" to act as representatives for the public interest. The powers of these officers are designed so that they may operate independent of interference. The Auditor-General, for example, is legislated for in the Audit Act 1994 and oversees the management of public assets and budgetary audits. =Governor= The Monarch (Queen Elizabeth II) is considered part of Parliament. The monarch's powers are exercised by the Governor who is in turn appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Premier. Among the Governor's vice-regal duties are the opening of Parliament and the signing of acts that are passed by the Victorian Parliament. The governor retains executive powers over the parliament, such as swearing in ministers, issuing writs for election and dissolving the parliament. The governor generally acts on the advice of the premier and the ministers of government when performing these functions. This following of advice reflects how the governor's role has changed over time from a powerful executive with veto authority to that of an advisory role limited by convention and precedent. However, the parliament is obliged to observe the governor's three rights in overseeing it: the right to be consulted, the right to warn, and the right to encourage. The governor may insist on being consulted on matters before the parliament at any time. The Governor's role includes formally opening sessions of parliament with a speech outlining the government's legislative agenda. Victoria also has a Lieutenant- Governor to fulfil the functions of the office when the Governor is otherwise unavailable. The Governor is not subordinate to Australia's Governor-General. All Australian state governors have jurisdiction over their respective states with their commissions coming directly from the monarch. =Premier and Ministry= The leader of the political party or coalition with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly is invited by the Governor of Victoria to form a government. The leader of that party is appointed Premier of Victoria and other senior members are appointed ministers with various portfolio responsibilities. The Premier and the Ministers are generally responsible for tabling legislation to the parliament. The Premier is, for the most part, the most powerful executive role within the Victorian Government. Similarly, the Ministers each oversee a specific task related to a chief responsibility of the government. The Premier and the Ministry separately form the Victorian Government's executive branch. The ministers form the cabinet, a group who meets to discuss and decide the direction of the government. Their specific roles and responsibilities are determined by their party caucuses. There are currently twenty-two ministers within the cabinet. Some responsibilities are delegated to fourteen parliamentary secretaries, who act as junior ministers and usually do not sit in cabinet meetings. The ministers are also referred to as \\"the front bench\\" as they sit on the benches at the front of each legislative chamber. The Premier and the ministers must be sitting members of parliament. There is no legal requirement that any of the executive government come from any particular house. However, since the Legislative Assembly must provide confidence and supply to the government of the day, the Premier is, by convention, a member of the Legislative Assembly. =Parties= Political parties form a central part of the parliamentary system. The government is opposed by an official opposition. The leader of the largest party in opposition becomes the Leader of the Opposition. The opposition plays a central role in debating government ideas as well as scrutinising the government's business and its agenda. However, the opposition's power is limited while the government commands a majority in the Legislative Assembly due to the traditionally strong party discipline throughout Australia. Parties must have at least 500 members on the Victorian electoral roll, have a party constitution and register with the Victorian Electoral Commission to receive official status. The Labor Party has been in Government since 4 December 2014, led by the Premier and leader of the Labor Party in Victoria, Daniel Andrews. The Leader of the Opposition Coalition is Michael O'Brien, who was elected as the leader of the Liberal Party on 6 December 2018 after their election defeat, replacing former leader Matthew Guy. The Greens are led by Samantha Ratnam. Parliamentary sovereignty Parliamentary sovereignty within Australia is a complex matter due to the nature of the monarchy, federation, and the gradual centralisation of power into the federal government over time. Victoria's Parliament is subjected to the limits of the Commonwealth constitution and its powers stem from the Crown. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Parliament has exclusive powers in some matters that the states may not exercise at all. In matters where the powers of the Victorian and federal parliaments overlap, the federal parliament's powers prevail. There are no other restrictions to Parliament's authority, though, and the largely ceremonial role the crown has in governance makes Victoria's parliament sovereign over Victoria in practice. Such power is nonetheless approved by the governor whose power stems from the monarch. Parliament's sovereign power over Victoria is supreme when compared to the equivalent federal parliament's power over Australia as a whole; Victoria's Constitution does not rigidly define a separation of powers as the Commonwealth's constitution does, meaning that all powers residing within the executive and judicial branches of government stem from Parliament. There is no legal impediment, therefore, to Parliament exercising control over the other branches of government. Parliamentary sovereignty was legally tested following the passage of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities 2006, which delegated powers to the judiciary to oversee human rights violations within Victoria. Although this allows the judiciary to intervene in Parliament's role in certain circumstances, subsequent legal analyses have determined that the courts only have such power as they have been granted by Parliament. In the specific case of the charter, the judiciary may indicate if legislation contravenes the charter but not invalidate the law, although this does not necessarily mean that a future parliament could not alter the charter to give the judiciary this power. Parliament may delegate powers to another branch, but as it may reverse such powers at any time it maintains sovereignty over the other branches of government. Sovereignty is further reinforced by the fact that no Parliament may pass a law that a later Parliament cannot overturn, including the delegation of powers to other branches. All controversial social issues are, in practice and in law, still determined and debated by Parliament. The 2003 changes to the Victorian Constitution entrenched several provisions, such as the requirement for a public referendum to alter how members of parliament are elected, and the independence of public offices. Such clauses are seen as infringing parliamentary sovereignty, and while they have not been tested in court, it is probable that these clauses are not legally valid. General legal rationale is that a given parliament can always overturn or amend the legislation of its predecessors. The exception to this is that an alteration to the state's constitution possibly could be entrenched if it was passed by a public referendum. The Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth) and Westminster tradition place limits on the level to which state constitutions can be entrenched, with the accepted view being that the supposedly entrenched clauses within Victoria's constitution could be overturned by a majority of both houses of parliament in the normal fashion. The practice of allocating tied grants is used by the federal government to circumvent the power of state parliaments. The federal government cannot exercise powers on matters it has not been given responsibility for, unlike the state parliaments whose powers are hardly limited. Victoria's Parliament, like all of the states of Australia, has a vertical fiscal imbalance and is dependent on the federal government for about half of its funding. The states gave up their ability to raise income taxes during the Second World War, but they have maintained responsibility for the management of the majority of services. The Australian Parliament typically only funds measures that it finds politically advantageous, though, meaning that it will generally make funding for certain projects conditional on accepting particular terms and conditions. Although this allows the federal government to exercise some control over the states, it does not change nor dilute the sovereignty that the Victorian Parliament wields; there is no way for the Australian Parliament to force the Victorian Parliament to accept a tied grant. Salary and allowances Members of both the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council are paid a base salary of $182,413 per annum (as of 1 July 2019). In June 2020, the Victorian Independent Remuneration Tribunal announced Victorian MPs would receive no increase in salaries for the financial year 2020-21. Office holders such as the President, Speaker, ministers and party leaders receive additional salary on top of the base salary. The Premier is paid an additional 100 percent of the base salary; the Leader of the Opposition and Government Ministers an additional 75 percent; the President and Speaker an additional 65 percent. Members are also entitled to receive various allowances for travel and work costs. Members representing non-Melbourne electorates are also entitled to a second home allowance. Prior to 1870 only Ministers and Office holders were provided with a salary. This in effect meant that members had to be wealthy enough to support themselves before seeking election to Parliament. In 1870 the Victorian Parliament provided for the reimbursing of members in relation to their expenses in attending Parliament, in effect the first salary for Members of the Victorian Parliament. At first passed as temporary measure, it later became permanent. The Act provided for a payment of ¬£300 p.a. to those who did not already receive a salary. This value is difficult to place in a modern context, due to Australia's conversion to a decimal currency and the smaller economy of the time. This salary would equate to approximately $35,000 in 2018 dollars based on inflation, but could be as much as approximately $340,000 when measuring it as a relative income of the time. Current Parliament =2018 Election= } } The current parliament is the 59th Victorian Parliament, having been elected at the 2018 Victorian State Election. It was formally opened by Governor Linda Dessau on its first sitting day on the 19 December 2019. The incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Daniel Andrews, was re-elected with an increased majority in the Legislative Assembly. The government holds 55 seats, the opposition 27, and the cross- bench consists of three members of the Greens and three independents. The government has 18 seats within the Legislative Council, and the opposition Liberal/National Coalition has 11. The remaining 11 are held by a variety of cross-bench parties. The election of a broad cross-bench drew some controversy due to the manipulation of group voting tickets by a collection of small parties in order to ensure that they attained more seats than their relatively small numbers of votes would normally provide. This led to such occurrences as the Greens receiving 13.5% of the primary vote in the Southern Metropolitan Region but losing to the Sustainable Australia party, who garnered only 1.3%. Similarly, Derryn Hinch's Justice Party gained 3 seats with a statewide 3.7% of the primary vote, while the Greens' statewide 9.3% primary vote earned them just one seat. =Changes to 59th Parliament= Catherine Cumming, originally elected to the Legislative Council on the Justice Party's ticket, left the party a week after her election. She now sits as an independent. Labor Party member Philip Dalidakis resigned from his seat representing the Southern Metropolitan Region within Legislative Council on 17 July 2019. He was replaced by Enver Erdogan, who was appointed to fill the casual vacancy in a Joint Sitting and was sworn in on 15 August. Liberal party member Mary Woolridge resigned from her seat representing the Easter Metropolitan Region within the Legislative Council on 7 December 2019. She was replaced by Dr Matthew Bach in a Joint Sitting held on 4 March 2020. Labor expelled MLC Adem Somyurek from the party following an incriminating expose alleging illegal activities aired on 60 Minutes. While still in parliament, he now sits on the cross bench.

Celestia comprised the entirety of \\"outer space\\", which Mangan laid claim to on behalf of humanity to ensure that no one country might establish a political hegemony there. As \\"Founder and First Representative\\", he registered this acquisition with the Recorder of Deeds and Titles of Cook County on January 1, 1949. At its foundation Celestia claimed to have 19 members, among them Mangan's daughter Ruth; a decade later a booklet published by the group claimed that membership had grown to 19,057. Mangan was active for many years in pursuing his claims on behalf of Celestia; in 1949 he notified the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United Nations that Celestia had banned all further atmospheric nuclear tests. Later, as the space race got underway in earnest he sent angry letters of protest to the leaders of the Soviet Union and United States on the occasions that their early space flights encroached upon his \\"territory\\" - although he later waived these proscriptions to allow for satellite launches by the latter. While Mangan and Celestia were politely ignored by the superpowers, there is evidence that at least some others were prepared to entertain his claims with a greater degree of seriousness; the first unfurling of the Celestian flag - featuring a blue sharp symbol within a white disc against a blue field - was broadcast in June 1958 to a television audience of millions across the U.S., and the following day the flag was raised at the United Nations building in New York City, to fly alongside those of the member nations of that organisation. The obverse of this 1959 solid gold 1 Celeston coin features the profile of Ruth Mangan as the allegorical figure \\"Magnanimity\\". Despite these efforts, the Nation of Celestial Space is thought to have become defunct with the death of its founder. Its only surviving legacy is the series of stamps and silver and gold coins and passports issued in its name by Mangan from the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s. Some of the coins minted by Celestia included a silver \\"1 Joule\\" of 4.15 grams (.925 silver) and a gold \\"1 Celeston\\" of 2.20 grams (.900 gold). Their scarcity ensures that they sell for many hundreds of dollars apiece on the rare occasions they come to market. James Thomas Mangan's descendants include his son, James C. Mangan (deceased), his daughter Ruth Mangan Stump, \\"Princess of the Nation of Celestial Space\\", and three grandsons, Glen Stump, \\"Duke of Mars\\", Dean Stump, \\"Duke of Selenia\\", and Todd Stump, \\"Duke of the Milky Way\\". Declaration The Declaration by the Nation of Celestial Space was issued by Celestia on December 21, 1948. It proclaims to establish the nation to \\"secure for sympathetic people, wherever they may live, the beauties and benefits of a vast domain yet unclaimed by any state or nation.\\" The document goes on to explain the nature of Celestia's claim.

They are present in much of China, south to northern Laos and Vietnam and are long cultivated elsewhere in eastern Asia, notably in Japan and Korea where they are native. It was introduced to North America in 1844 from Europe and Asia where it was originally sought after as an exotic ornamental tree. Its fruits (botanically capsules) were also used as packaging material for goods shipped from East Asia to North America, leading to Paulownia groves where they were dumped near major ports. The tree has not persisted prominently in US gardens, in part due to its overwintering brown fruits that some consider ugly. In some areas it has escaped cultivation and is found in disturbed plots. Some US authorities consider the genus an invasive species, but in Europe, where it is also grown in gardens, it is not regarded as invasive. The genus, originally Pavlovnia but now usually spelled Paulownia, was named in honour of Anna Paulowna, queen consort of The Netherlands (1795‚Äì1865), daughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia. It is also called \\"princess tree\\" for the same reason.Rush Industries, 2000. Paulownia trees produce as many as 20 million tiny seeds per year. However, the seeds are very susceptible to soil biota and only colonize well on sterile soils (such as after a high temperature wildfire). Well-drained soil is also essential. Successful plantations usually purchase plants that have been professionally propagated from root cuttings or seedlings.Cultivation of Paulownia - 3. Sexual & Asexual Propagation www.kalliergeia.com, accessed 20 May 2020 Although seeds, seedlings, and roots of even mature trees are susceptible to rot, the wood is not and is used for boat building and surfboards. Trees can grow to maturity in under 10 years and produce strong, lightweight timber, good as firewood, with an even higher strength to weight ratio than balsa wood.  Morphology  Letters A-F correspond to descriptions in the adjacent Morphology paragraph. Paulownia is a genus of angiosperm trees, and one of the fastest growing trees in the world. Paulownia tomentosa can grow over 30 meters tall and has (E) large heart shaped leaves ranging from 10‚Äì20 cm wide and 15‚Äì30 cm long with a 10‚Äì20 cm long petiole. The leaves grow in opposite decussate pairs, and as the name tomentosa suggests, are covered in hairs. The leaf margin can be toothed or entire and sometimes may be slightly lobed. They can be distinguished from common look alike genera such as Catalpa and Cercis by secondary and tertiary venation. The leaves are late to come in on the tree and late to fall from the typically deciduous Paulownia, however in tropical areas the tree can become evergreen. The leaves are often preceded by pale violet to purple shaded tubular flowers similar to a foxglove. Like most members of the Lamiales the flowers are zygomorphic. The (B) inflorescences are terminal erect 15‚Äì30 cm long panicles of ~5 cm long flowers. (C) The thick fused calyx is covered by a brown hairy indumentum and the fused calyx tube is the same length as its calyx lobes, except in P. catalpifolia and P. elogata where the lobes are shorter than the calyx tubes. The corolla has 5 fused lobes with a shorter adaxial bilobed lip and a somewhat longer abaxial trilobed lower lip. The lips of all the petals are curled and their surface tomentose. On the inner side of the lower trilobed corolla tube run two light yellow folded ridges from the calyx to the lip. These are interpreted as floral guides to the top of the corolla tube. (C) Inside the corolla tube, and approximately half way down, are 4 stamen filaments fused to the petals at the base, with 2 being longer than the others. At the bottom of the corolla tube is a short corolla-stamen tube. The base of the stamen filaments are bent so that they run along the upper portion of the flower with the arrow shaped anthers then depositing pollen on the dorsal side of a variety of pollen- feeding insects. (D) The superior bilocular ovary, surrounded by the brown calyx, with its stigma and style rising up, is approximately the same length as the longer stamen filaments that surround it. This is left on the stem as the corolla and stamen fall off. The stigma tip has a singular small hole that leads to a tubular dilated chamber at the top of the style covered in receptive papillae. In the species P. kawakamii this stigma tip is slightly bilobed. This is a unique morphological characteristic to distinguish Paulownia from all of the Lamiales. At the bottom of the ovary is a nectary with nectary slits on the basal sides of the ovary beneath a hairy region. The ovary then develops into a sticky green oval capsule tapered at the apex with the remaining dried up style sometimes still attached. (F) The capsule remains on the persistent brown calyx were they can last on the tree through the rest of the year before turning brown and woody and loculicidal dehiscence reveals up to 2000 small winged seeds stacked tightly inside. (G) The tiny seeds have lateral wings that gradually increase in length around the seed. The ventral and dorsal side of the seed are flat. This wing shape on the seeds is another distinguishing characteristic of Paulownia from the rest of the Lamiales. (A) The new buds, enclosed by the early brown fuzzy calyx, are visible in late summer to early fall and wait dormant, alongside the brown seed capsules, till spring. Fossil record Paulownia once occurred in North America, with fossil found leaves in Tertiary strata of Ellensburg Canyon of Washington state. Paulownia macrofossils have been recovered from the late Zanclean stage of the Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, ItalyMessian to Zanclean vegetation and climate of Northern and Central Italy by Adele Bertini & Edoardo Martinetto, Bollettino della Societa Paleontologica Italiana, 47 (2), 2008, 105-121. Modena, 11 lugio 2008. and Paulownia caucasica macrofossils have been recovered from strata of the Serravallian stage of the Miocene in Georgia in the Caucasus region.The History of the Flora and Vegetation of Georgia by Irina Shatilova, Nino Mchedlishvili, Luara Rukhadze, Eliso Kvavadze, Georgian National Museum Institute of Paleobiology, Tbilisi 2011, It is believed that the climate then would have been suitable for the genus across the whole northern hemisphere.  Uses  In China, it is popular for roadside planting and as an ornamental tree. Paulownia needs much light and does not like high water tables. As a forestry crop Paulownia are exacting in their requirements, performing well only in very well draining soil, with summer rainfall or availability of irrigation water. Paulownia grown on plantations generally has widely spaced growth rings, meaning that it is soft and of little value; wood with close growth rings is harder and of higher value. Paulownia is extremely fast growing; up to 20 feet in one year when young. Some species of plantation Paulownia can be harvested for saw timber in as little as five years. Once the trees are harvested, they regenerate from their existing root systems, earning them the name of the \\"Phoenix tree\\". Paulownia is also used in Chinese agroforestry systems because it grows fast, its wood is light but strong, its flowers are rich in nectar, its leaves make good fodder for farm animals, it is deep-rooting, and it is late-leafing and its canopy is quite sparse so that crops below it get both light enough to grow and shelter. This Paulownia flower pattern (go-shichi-no-kiri) is the symbol of the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan. It also decorates the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. Paulownia is known in Japanese as , specifically referring to P. tomentosa; it is also known as the \\"princess tree\\". Paulownia is the mon of the office of prime minister, and also serves as the Government Seal of Japan used by the Cabinet and the Government of Japan (whereas the chrysanthemum is the Imperial Seal of Japan). It is one of the suits in the card game hanafuda, associated with the month of November or December (some regions reverse the order of these two months).Go-Stop: THE CARDS \\"...called hwa-tu in Korea, and hanafuda in Japan...

One of many versions of the Ambitious Card Routine available on internet video. The Elevator card, p. 85 This is a classic effect in card magic and serves as a study subject for students of magic. Most performing card magicians will have developed their own personal Ambitious Card routine. The effect is often credited to French magician Gustav Alberti, in the mid-19th century. However, there is a related idea in Ponsin's Nouvelle Magie Blanche Devoil√©e, published in 1854, that might precede that. The ambitious card is also known as the \\"Trick that Fooled\\" Houdini as Dai Vernon fooled Houdini with the Ambitious Card. Many magicians base their routine on Darryl Martinez's version as he had a comprehensive VHS tape on the many variations possible on accomplishing this effect.  Effect  The magician usually gets a card signed by an audience member and inserts it into the middle of the deck, after which it reappears at the top. This is repeated under more and more improbable conditions, sometimes to humorous effect. Methods There are many methods for accomplishing the basic effect. These are often based on sleight of hand methods such as the double lift; however, gimmicks can also be used, such as a stripper deck. More detailed descriptions can be found in books such as The Royal Road to Card Magic, The Expert at the Card Table and Card College. Many magicians have come up with their own methods and routines. Dai Vernon's ambitious card routine, for example, can be found in the book Stars of Magic.  Variations  Variations to this trick can be linked together to create routines. Many magicians perform the same routine every time, though the trick is structured such that one is able to combine variations in different ways for each performance. This is one factor which has earned the Ambitious Card the status of a classic effect. Variations of this effect include: *The magician has the spectator sign the card to prove there is no duplicate. *The spectator is handed the \\"ambitious card\\" and asked to put it in the middle, then asked to hold the deck and do some type of magic move, essentially calling the card to the top of the deck himself. *The spectator marks an X on the back of an indifferent card at the top of the deck, only to see the same X appear on the back of the \\"ambitious card\\" after it has risen to the top. *The \\"ambitious card\\" is bent so that it is seen to be physically different from all the other cards, making it clear that it is placed into the middle of the deck, and increasing the amazement of the spectator as it is seen to rise to the top. *It is told that the \\"ambitious card\\" has a connection with the spectator and is shown to come to the top only when spectator commands. Some variations include an ending to the ambitious card routine, such as a card to shoe, or a card to wallet.

It was released in December 1970 on the Reprise label.  Recording  Desertshore was co-produced by John Cale and Joe Boyd. Like its predecessor The Marble Index, it is an avant-garde album with neoclassical elements. \\"Janitor of Lunacy\\" was composed as a tribute to her friend Brian Jones, who had died the previous year. The back and front covers feature stills from the film La cicatrice interieure by Philippe Garrel, which starred Nico, Garrel and her son Ari Boulogne. A few of the songs from the album were included on the soundtrack of the film. Legacy Released in December 1970, Desertshore received little commercial recognition. Similar to that of The Marble Index, upon its release the album obtained a small cult following, but was overlooked by most large publications and the public in general. However, like the bulk of Nico's discography, Desertshore has received mainstream praise from critics in subsequent years. AllMusic and The New Rolling Stone Album Guide provided strong, positive reception for the album. Tiny Mix Tapes rated Desertshore five out of five. However, The Village Voice was less favorable, giving the album a \\"C\\" rating. \\"All That Is My Own\\" was selected by Morrissey for inclusion on his Under the Influence compilation. \\"Le petit chevalier\\" was covered live by Bjork during her Post Tour in 1996 and also by Bat for Lashes in 2007 at the Glastonbury festival, and was prominently sampled by Abu Lahab on his 2013 album Of Heliotaxis and Cosmic Knifing.

The studio session was made open to the public and the entirety of the 3-day, 12-hour-long session was recorded, given a limited press, and released as The Desertshore Installation. The plan had been to edit these three days of recordings and craft the finished album from that material, but the group were not satisfied with the sessions and decided to re-record the album. Peter Christopherson continued working on it in Bangkok with Danny Hyde until his death in November 2010. Hyde passed the work they had done to remaining Throbbing Gristle members Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti to complete, which they have accomplished with the help of several guest vocalists, including Marc Almond, Sasha Grey, Blixa Bargeld and Antony Hegarty. The album, called Desertshore/The Final Report, was released on November 26, 2012, under the name X-TG. The album was debuted live at AV Festival on March 17, 2012, performed by Carter and Tutti.

Laird's commercial expedition between 1832 and 1834 to navigate the Niger and initiate trade between Europeans and Africans northwards of the coast was considered a failure, majority of the passengers died and the volume of trade realized was minimal. However, his experience provided information about the design of vessels suitable on the Niger and the various settlements in the interior of the Niger Delta. Laird never returned to Africa but instead devoted himself to the development of trade with West Africa and especially to the opening up of the countries then forming the British protectorates of Nigeria. One of his principal reasons for so doing was his belief that this method was the best means of stopping the slave trade and raising the social condition of the Africans.  Early life  Laird was born at Greenock, the younger son of Agnes and William Laird, founder of the Birkenhead firm of shipbuilders of that name. His paternal grandfather, John Laird was a merchant and rope maker in Greenock while his maternal grandfather, Gregor Macgregor had commanded a ship that undertook voyages between Greenock and the West Indies. Laird's Brother, John Laird was himself a notable shipbuilder. Laird was educated at Edinburgh University, in 1929, while at the university, he fell ill, caused by typhus infection, he was helped to recovery by Dr Thomas Briggs who later accompanied Laird in the expedition to the Niger. After graduation, Laird joined the family business in Birkenhead where he developed interest in building steamships.Tanner, Margaret Louise MacGregor Laird : the five percent failure . M. A. Thesis, University of Western Ontario, l978. Pp5-6  Niger voyage  In the early 1830s, Richard Lander, an associate of Hugh Clapperton was provided subsidy to return to Africa and find the course of the Niger. Upon the reception of Richard Lander's report of reaching the mouth of the Niger, enthusiasm for an exploratory team to West Africa grew and the report also rekindled interest in merchants looking for new markets. In 1831, Laird and certain Liverpool merchants formed the African Inland Commercial Company with the objective of the commercial development of the Niger regions, after the lower course of the Niger having been made known that year by Richard Lemon Lander and John Lander. Laird worked on the designs of the ships to be contracted on a voyage to navigate the Niger, though the primary aim was to foster trade with the interior communities, Laird also had a personal objective of implementing Christian and humanitarian ideals. In 1832, the company sent two small ships and a brig to the Niger, the Alburkah, a paddle-wheel steamer of fifty-five tons designed by Laird, the first iron vessel to make an ocean voyage and the Quorra, conveying twenty nine men, made of wood, it measured 112 feet in length, a beam of 16 feet and a draft of eight feet. The original plan of the expedition was to set up a floating vessel, the brig at River Nun, a Niger tributary with history of trade with Europeans, and two paddle vessels to navigate northwards to establish a trading post at Lokoja. Laird was among the forty eight European voyagers in the expedition, which was led by Richard Lander, all but nine of whom died from fever or, in the case of Lander, from wounds. Though two doctors came along, quinine was rarely used to treat fever that became more pronounced as they made their ascent up the river, instead miasma was thought the main contributory reason for an epidemic of fever. Laird went up the Niger to the confluence of the Benue River (then called the Shary or Tchadda), which he was the first white man to ascend. He did not go far up the river but formed an accurate idea as to its source and course. Laird was weakened by fever and had to return to Fernando Po where he was received by Colonel Edward Nicolls, the British Governor at Fernando Po, who later became his father-in-law. He rested in Fernando Po before returning to England. Laird and Surgeon R. A. K. Oldfield were the only surviving officers besides Captain (then Lieutenant) William Allen, who accompanied the expedition on the orders of the Admiralty to survey the river. In 1837, Laird and Oldfield published the Narrative of an Expedition into the Interior of Africa by the River Niger in 1832, 1833, 1834.  British and North American Steam Navigation Company  Laird's interests were not, however, wholly African. In 1837 he was one of the promoters of a company formed to run steamships between England and New York, and in 1838 the Sirius, sent out by this company, was the first ship to cross the Atlantic from Europe entirely under steam. Between 1835 and 1841, Laird was involved with the British and American Steam Navigation Company. The firm launched a vessel, the British Queen providing mail service between England and America, but this venture was unprofitable. It then added another vessel, the President which disappeared en route to England from New York. The company did not survive the disappearance of the President and the navigation firm was liquidated in 1841. Despite the unsuccessful expedition, Laird continued to stimulate interest in promoting commercial trade in the hinterland of West Africa, particularly within the settlements closest to the mouth of the Niger. He advised merchants to cultivate trade with coastal middlemen as a primary business objective, and as a secondary objective, to send a steam vessel inland to woo communities in the interior and bypass the coastal middlemen. In 1841, when the British blockade of the coast of West Africa failed to halt the transatlantic slave trade, Laird's believe in legitimate trade as a deterrent to slave trading soon gradually gave way to the idea that cheap labour through unrestricted emigration to the West Indies would cripple the demand for slaves while also increasing production of sugar. In 1838, after the apprenticeship system in West Indies was eliminated ending slavery, Laird advocated voluntary emigration of Africans to West Indies as a way to curtail slavery and also bring Africans in contact to Europeans and their culture, views he voiced to a parliamentary select committee on the West Coast of Africa in 1842 and to the General Anti-Slavery Convention in 1843.  A Return to West African Trade: The African Steam Navigation Company  Laird never went back to West Africa, However, upon renewed government interest in the affairs of West Africa after the appointment of John Beecroft as consul in the Oil Rivers and the 1851 annexation of Lagos, Laird submitted a proposal to the government for regular mail communication by steamship between England and West Africa. Laird's proposal found favour with the government and he was given a mail contract including government subsidies. In 1852, he co-founded the African Steam Navigation Company and in 1854, set up, with the support of the British government, a small steamer, the Pleiad, which under W. B. Baikie made so successful a voyage that Laird induced the government to sign contracts for annual trading trips by steamers specially built for navigation of the Niger and Benue. Various stations were founded on the Niger, and though government support was withdrawn after the death of Laird and Baikie, British traders continued to frequent the river, which Laird had opened up to little or no personal advantage. Laird died in London in 1861.

Shotover Hill is east of Oxford. Its highest point is above sea level. Early history The toponym may be derived from the Old English , meaning \\"steep slope\\". Shotover was part of the Wychwood royal forestSherwood & Pevsner, 1974, pp. 763‚Äì765 from around the period of the Domesday Book until 1660. It was also known as the Forest of Shotover. A hill figure is recorded as having once been carved on the hill. Antiquarian John Aubrey writes: :\\"On Shotover Hill [near Oxford] was heretofore (not long before the Civil Wars, in the memory of man) the effigies of a Giant cut in the earth, as the White Horse by Ashbury Park\\" Refers to John Aubrey's Monumenta Britannica, unpublished manuscript in the Bodleian, part 2, folio 242b Shotover Road The road between London and Oxford used to pass over the top of Shotover Hill. The road was made into a turnpike under the 1719 Stokenchurch Turnpike Act. Shotover Park Shotover Park and garden were begun in about 1714 for James Tyrrell of Oakley. Tyrell died in 1718 and the house was completed by his son, General James Tyrell. There is no known record of the name of the architect. In 1855 the architect Joshua Sims added two wings in the same style of the original part of the house. The garden was begun in 1718 and completed in 1730. It is a rare survivor of formal gardens of this period, laid out along an east‚Äìwest axis long. The centrepiece of the garden east of the house is a straight canal, ending with a Gothic Revival folly. The architect of the folly is unknown, but if it was built before 1742 it may be one of the earliest examples of the Gothic Revival. The garden west of the house has a similarly long vista, ending with an octagonal temple designed in the 1730s by William Kent. During the Second World War there was a prisoner-of-war camp in the grounds. Major Alexander Alfred Miller and his youngest brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Miller (Crown Equerry 1961‚Äì87), both lived in Shotover Park.

This reaction is part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Other malate dehydrogenases, which have other EC numbers and catalyze other reactions oxidizing malate, have qualified names like malate dehydrogenase (NADP+).  Isozymes  Several isozymes of malate dehydrogenase exist. There are two main isoforms in eukaryotic cells. One is found in the mitochondrial matrix, participating as a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes the oxidation of malate. The other is found in the cytoplasm, assisting the malate-aspartate shuttle with exchanging reducing equivalents so that malate can pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes. Humans and most other mammals express the following two malate dehydrogenases: Protein families 3-D crystal structure of the mobile loop region in malate dehydrogenase in the closed and open conformation. The MDH closed conformation is shown in pink (indicated by the pink arrow) while the open conformation is shown in cyan (indicated by the cyan arrow).The malate dehydrogenase family contains L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenases. L-lactate dehydrogenases catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate, the last step in anaerobic glycolysis. The N-terminus is a Rossmann NAD-binding fold and the C-terminus is an unusual alpha+beta fold.  Evolution and structure  In most organisms, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) exists as a homodimeric molecule and is closely related to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in structure. It is a large protein molecule with subunits weighing between 30 and 35 kDa. Based on the amino acid sequences, it seems that MDH has diverged into two main phylogenetic groups that closely resemble either mitochondrial isozymes or cytoplasmic/chloroplast isozymes. Because the sequence identity of malate dehydrogenase in the mitochondria is more closely related to its prokaryotic ancestors in comparison to the cytoplasmic isozyme, the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts were developed through endosymbiosis is plausible. The amino acid sequences of archaeal MDH are more similar to that of LDH than that of MDH of other organisms. This indicates that there is a possible evolutionary linkage between lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. Each subunit of the malate dehydrogenase dimer has two distinct domains that vary in structure and functionality. A parallel Œ≤-sheet structure makes up the NAD+ binding domain, while four Œ≤-sheets and one Œ±-helix comprise the central NAD+ binding site. The subunits are held together through extensive hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Malate dehydrogenase has also been shown to have a mobile loop region that plays a crucial role in the enzyme's catalytic activity. Studies have shown that conformational change of this loop region from the open conformation to the closed conformation after binding of substrate enhances MDH catalysis through shielding of substrate and catalytic amino acids from solvent. Studies have also indicated that this loop region is highly conserved in malate dehydrogenase.  Mechanism  Active site of malate dehydrogenase The active site of malate dehydrogenase is a hydrophobic cavity within the protein complex that has specific binding sites for the substrate and its coenzyme, NAD+. In its active state, MDH undergoes a conformational change that encloses the substrate to minimize solvent exposure and to position key residues in closer proximity to the substrate. The three residues in particular that comprise a catalytic triad are histidine (His-195), aspartate (Asp-168), both of which work together as a proton transfer system, and arginines (Arg-102, Arg-109, Arg-171), which secure the substrate. Mechanistically, malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of the hydroxyl group of malate by utilizing NAD+ as an electron acceptor. This oxidation step results in the elimination of a proton and a hydride ion from the substrate. NAD+ receives the hydride ion (specifically, the hydride ion is transferred to the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+) and becomes reduced to NADH while concomitantly, the His-195 residue on the enzyme accepts the proton. The positively charged His-195 residue, which is involved in base catalysis of the substrate, is stabilized by the adjacent, negatively charged Asp-168 residue. This electrostatic stabilization helps facilitate the transfer of the proton. Arg-102, Arg-109, and Arg-171 (which are protonated, and thus positively charged) participate in electrostatic catalysis and help to bind the negatively charged carboxylates on the substrate. Additionally, the Arginine residues on the enzyme provide additional substrate specificity and binding through hydrogen bonding between the guanidinium side chain of the Arginine amino acid residues and the carboxylates of the substrate. Studies have also identified a mobile loop in malate dehydrogenase that participates in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The loop undergoes a conformational change to shield the substrate and catalytic amino acids from the solvent in response to the binding of the malate dehydrogenase:coenzyme complex to substrate. This flipping of the loop to the up position to cover the active site also promotes enhanced interaction of the catalytically important amino residues on the enzyme with the substrate. Additionally, the movement of the loop has been shown to correlate with the rate determining step of the enzyme.  Function  = Reaction = General reaction showing malate dehydrogenase catalyzed oxidation of malate through reduction of NAD+.Malate dehydrogenases catalyzes the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate. In the citric acid cycle, malate dehydrogenase is responsible for catalyzing the regeneration of oxaloacetate This reaction occurs through the oxidation of hydroxyl group on malate and reduction of NAD+. The mechanism of the transfer of the hydride ion to NAD+ is carried out in a similar mechanism seen in lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. The ŒîG'¬∞ of malate dehydrogenase is +29.7 kJ/mol and the ŒîG (in the cell) is 0 kJ/mol. = Other pathways = Malate dehydrogenase is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the synthesis of glucose from smaller molecules. Pyruvate in the mitochondria is acted upon by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate, a citric acid cycle intermediate. In order to get the oxaloacetate out of the mitochondria, malate dehydrogenase reduces it to malate, and it then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once in the cytosol, the malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. Finally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). = Kinetics = Kinetic studies show that malate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity is ordered. The cofactor NAD+/NADH is bound to the enzyme before the substrate. The Km value for malate, i.e., the concentration at which the enzyme activity is half-maximal, is 2 mM. The Kcat value is 259.2 s‚àí1.  Effect of pH on catalytic activity  Additionally, pH levels control specificity of substrate binding by malate dehydrogenase due to proton transfer in the catalytic mechanism. A histidine moiety with a pK value of 7.5 has been suggested to play a role in the pH- dependency of the enzyme. Studies have indicated that the binding of the enol form oxaloacetate with the malate dehydrogenase:NADH complex forms much more rapidly at higher pH values. Additionally, L-malate binding to malate dehydrogenase is promoted at alkaline conditions. Consequently, the non- protonated form malate dehydrogenase binds preferentially to L-malate and the enol form of oxaloacetate. In contrast, D-malate, hydroxymalonate, and the keto form of oxaloacetate have been found to bind exclusively to the protonated form of the enzyme. Specifically, when the histidine is protonated, the His residue can form a hydrogen bond with the substrate's carbonyl oxygen, which shifts electron density away from the oxygen and makes it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by hydride. This promotes the binding of malate dehydrogenase to these substrates. As a result, at lower pH values malate dehydrogenase binds preferentially to D-malate, hydroxymalonate, and keto-oxaloacetate.  Allosteric regulation  Because malate dehydrogenase is closely tied to the citric acid cycle, studies have proposed and experimentally demonstrated that citrate is an allosteric regulator of malate dehydrogenase depending on the concentrations of L-malate and NAD+. This may be due to deviations observed in the kinetic behavior of malate dehydrogenase at high oxaloacetate and L-malate concentrations. Experiments have shown that Citrate can both allosterically activate and inhibit the enzymatic activity of malate dehydrogenase. Citrate has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of L-malate when there are low levels of L-malate and NAD+. However, in the presence of high levels of malate and NAD+, citrate can stimulate the production of oxaloacetate. Although malate dehydrogenase is typically considered a reversible enzyme, it is believed that there is an allosteric regulatory site on the enzyme where citrate can bind to and drive the reaction equilibrium in either direction. Glutamate has also been shown to inhibit malate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, it has been shown that alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase can interact with mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase to form a complex, which can then bind to malate dehydrogenase, forming a ternary complex that reverses inhibitory action on malate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity by glutamate. Additionally, the formation of this complex enables glutamate to react with aminotransferase without interfering activity of malate dehydrogenase. The formation of this ternary complex also facilitates the release of oxaloacetate from malate dehydrogenase to aminotransferase. Kinetically, the binding of malate dehydrogenase to the binary complex of alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and aminotrannferase has been shown to increase reaction rate of malate dehydrogenase because the Km of malate dehydrogenase is decreased when it is bound as part of this complex.

Quarantine Island/Kamau Taurua from above the Portobello Marine Laboratory on Otago Peninsula. The remaining two storied Married Quarters building of the quarantine station is in the centre. The island covers an area of , and is a publicly accessible recreation reserve. The buildings on the island are owned by Quarantine Island/Kamau Taurua Community (QIKTC). Its management is shared between QIKTC and the Department of Conservation. A smaller island, Goat Island / Rakiriri, lies close to Quarantine Island. Both islands lie across the harbour between the town of Port Chalmers and the marine laboratory on Portobello Peninsula, part of the Otago Peninsula.  Names  The island has been known by a number of names, including St Martin Island. In 1996 as part of the NgƒÅi Tahu settlement the name of Kamau Taurua, meaning 'a place to set nets' was restored as part of the official name.  History  The island served as the quarantine station for Otago from 1863 until 1924. It was one of four in NZ . When ships arrived in Otago harbour with infectious diseases, passengers were quarantined for that disease, usually one to two weeks, but sometimes longer. The few passengers that were actually sick were treated in the hospital on top of the island. In total 41 ships were quarantined at the island. Of about 9000 people quarantined about 70 died. There is a small cemetery on the island where they and some of the keeper's family are buried. During the First World War, soldiers who had venereal diseases (either diagnosed when they volunteered or acquired abroad) were treated on the island, then called the 'Port Chalmers Military Hospital'. However, most NZ soldiers with VD were treated overseas. . Only one of the main quarantine buildings from these years has survived, and this is now saved. The island has a NZ Historic Places Trust Historic Area classification. After the quarantine station closed in 1924 the buildings were sold and island was leased.  Visitors  Now the area around the buildings is leased by Quarantine Island/Kamau Taurua Community, established in 1958 as St Martin Island Community, and the remainder jointly managed by the Community and the Department of Conservation. The resident keeper welcomes visitors to St Martin Lodge, and oversees a wide range of ecological, educational, historical and cultural projects.

R. James's story \\"Oh, Whistle, And I'll Come To You, My Lad\\". A ghost story may be any piece of fiction, or drama, that includes a ghost, or simply takes as a premise the possibility of ghosts or characters' belief in them.\\"Ghost Stories\\" in Margaret Drabble (ed.), The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. (p. 404-5). The \\"ghost\\" may appear of its own accord or be summoned by magic. Linked to the ghost is the idea of \\"hauntings\\", where a supernatural entity is tied to a place, object or person. Ghost stories are commonly examples of ghostlore. Colloquially, the term \\"ghost story\\" can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a short story format, within genre fiction. It is a form of supernatural fiction and specifically of weird fiction, and is often a horror story. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.  History  The ghost of a pirate, from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates (1903) A widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form. The campfire story, a form of oral storytelling, often involves recounting ghost stories, or other scary stories. Some of the stories are decades old, with varying versions across multiple cultures. Many schools and educational institutions encourage ghost storytelling as part of literature. In 1929, five key features of the English ghost story were identified in \\"Some Remarks on Ghost Stories\\" by M. R. James. As summarized by Frank Coffman for a course in popular imaginative literature, they were: * The pretense of truth * \\"A pleasing terror\\" * No gratuitous bloodshed or sex * No \\"explanation of the machinery\\" * Setting: \\"those of the writer's (and reader's) own day\\" The introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as Good Housekeeping and The New Yorker.  Literature  John Dee and Edward Kelley invoking the spirit of a deceased person (engraving from the Astrology by Ebenezer Sibly, 1806) = Early examples = Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them. Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer's Odyssey, which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead, as well as the Old Testament in which the Witch of Endor calls the spirit of the prophet Samuel. The play Mostellaria, by the Roman playwright Plautus, is the earliest known work to feature a haunted dwelling, and is sometimes translated as The Haunted House. Another early account of a haunted place comes from an account by Pliny the Younger (c. 50 AD). Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens by a ghost bound in chains, an archetype that would become familiar in later literature. Ghosts often appeared in the tragedies of the Roman writer Seneca, who would later influence the revival of tragedy on the Renaissance stage, particularly Thomas Kyd and Shakespeare. The One Thousand and One Nights, sometimes known as Arabian Nights, contains a number of ghost stories, often involving jinn (also spelled as djinn), ghouls and corpses. In particular, the tale of \\"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\\" revolves around a house haunted by jinns. Other medieval Arabic literature, such as the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity, also contain ghost stories. The 11th century Japanese work The Tale of Genji contains ghost stories, and includes characters being possessed by spirits. = English Renaissance Theatre = \\"Hamlet and his father's ghost\\" by Henry Fuseli (1780s drawing). The ghost is wearing stylised plate armour in 17th-century style, including a morion type helmet and tassets. Depicting ghosts as wearing armour, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in Elizabethan theatre. In the mid-16th century, the works of Seneca were rediscovered by Italian humanists, and they became the models for the revival of tragedy. Seneca's influence is particularly evident in Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Shakespeare's Hamlet, both of which share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and ghosts among the cast. The ghosts in Richard III also resemble the Senecan model, while the ghost in Hamlet plays a more complex role. The shade of Hamlet's murdered father in Hamlet has become one of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature. In another of Shakespeare's works, Macbeth, the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character. In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or lifts, and eventually became clich√©d stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, point out, \\"In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.\\" An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that \\"at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed.\\" = Border ballads = Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the ‚ÄúBorder Ballads‚Äù of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include The Unquiet Grave, The Wife of Usher's Well, and Sweet William's Ghost, which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad King Henry, a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king's horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman. = Romantic era = Depiction of a woman telling a ghost story. One of the key early appearances by ghosts was The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole in 1764, considered to be the first gothic novel. However, although the ghost story shares the use of the supernatural with the Gothic novel, the two forms differ. Ghost stories, unlike Gothic fiction, usually take place in a time and location near to the audience of the story. The modern short story emerged in Germany in the early decades of the 19th century. Kleist's The Beggar Woman of Locarno, published in 1810, and several other works from the period lay claim to being the first ghost short stories of a modern type. E. T. A. Hoffmann's ghost stories include \\"The Elementary Spirit\\" and \\"The Mines of Falun\\".Andrew Barger, \\"Introduction:All Ghosts are Grey\\" in Barger (editor),The Best Ghost Stories 1800‚Äì1849: A Classic Ghost Anthology. Bottletree Books LLC, 2011. , (pp. 7-12) The Russian equivalent of the ghost story is the bylichka.Pamela Davidson. Russian Literature and Its Demons. Berghahn Books, 2000. . Page 59. Notables examples of the genre from the 1830s include Gogol's Viy and Pushkin's The Queen of Spades, although there were scores of other stories from lesser known writers, produced primarily as Christmas fiction. The Vosges mountain range is the setting for most ghost stories by the French writing team of Erckmann-Chatrian. One of the earliest writers of ghost stories in English was Sir Walter Scott. His ghost stories, \\"Wandering Willie's Tale\\" (1824, first published as part of Redgauntlet) and The Tapestried Chamber (1828) eschewed the \\"Gothic\\" style of writing and helped set an example for later writers in the genre. = \\"Golden Age of the Ghost Story\\" = Historian of the ghost story Jack Sullivan has noted that many literary critics argue a \\"Golden Age of the Ghost Story\\" existed between the decline of the Gothic novel in the 1830s and the start of the First World War. Sullivan argues that the work of Edgar Allan Poe and Sheridan Le Fanu inaugurated this \\"Golden Age\\". Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu was one of the most influential writers of ghost stories.. Le Fanu's collections, such as In a Glass Darkly (1872) and The Purcell Papers (1880), helped popularise the short story as a medium for ghost fiction. Charlotte Riddell, who wrote fiction as Mrs. J. H. Riddell, created ghost stories which were noted for adept use of the haunted house theme.J. L. Campbell, Sr., \\"Mrs. J. H. Riddell\\", in Bleiler, ed., Supernatural Fiction Writers. 19th-century etching by John Leech of the Ghost of Christmas Present as depicted in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol The \\"classic\\" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, ‚ÄúMalevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‚Äòthe stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...‚Äù. Famous literary apparitions from the Victorian period are the ghosts of A Christmas Carol, in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. In a precursor to A Christmas Carol Dickens published \\"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\\". Dickens also wrote \\"The Signal-Man\\", another work featuring a ghost.  Jamesian style  David Langford has described British author M. R. James as writing \\"the 20th century's most influential canon of ghost stories\\".David Langford, \\"James, Montague Rhodes\\", in David Pringle, ed., St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers (London: St. James Press, 1998). James perfected a method of story-telling which has since become known as Jamesian, which involved abandoning many of the traditional Gothic elements of his predecessors. The classic Jamesian tale usually includes the following elements: :# a characterful setting in an English village, seaside town or country estate; an ancient town in France, Denmark or Sweden; or a venerable abbey or university. :# a nondescript and rather na√Øve gentleman-scholar as protagonist (often of a reserved nature). :# the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks, calls down the wrath, or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace, usually from beyond the grave. According to James, the story must \\"put the reader into the position of saying to himself, 'If I'm not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!'\\"James, M.R., \\"Preface to More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\\". In Joshi, S.T., ed. (2005). Count Magnus and Other Ghost Stories: The Complete Ghost Stories of M.R. James, Volume 1, pt. 217. Penguin Books. He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology Ghosts and Marvels (Oxford, 1924): \\"Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.\\" He also noted: \\"Another requisite, in my opinion, is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story.\\" Despite his suggestion (in the essay \\"Stories I Have Tried to Write\\") that writers employ reticence in their work, many of James's tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence. = 19th-century American writers = Influenced by British and German examples, American writers began to produce their own ghost stories. Washington Irving's short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a Headless Horseman. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as Sleepy Hollow, a successful 1999 feature film.Sleepy Hollow at Box Office Mojo. Retrieved 29 January 2009. Irving also wrote \\"The Adventure of the German Student\\" and Edgar Allan Poe wrote some stories which contain ghosts, such as \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" and \\"Morella\\". In the later 19th century, mainstream American writers such as Edith Wharton, Mary E. Wilkins FreemanBenjamin Fisher, \\"Transitions from Victorian to Modern: The Supernatural Stories of Mary Wilkins Freeman and Edith Wharton\\" in: Robillard, Douglas, ed. American Supernatural Fiction: From Edith Wharton to the Weird Tales Writers. New York: Garland, 1996. (pp. 3-42). and F. Marion CrawfordDouglas Robillard, \\"The Wandering Ghosts of F. Marion Crawford\\" in: Robillard, Douglas, ed. American Supernatural Fiction: From Edith Wharton to the Weird Tales Writers. New York: Garland, 1996. (pp. 43-58). all wrote ghost fiction. Henry James also wrote ghost stories, including the famous The Turn of the Screw. The Turn of the Screw has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film The Innocents and Benjamin Britten's opera The Turn of the Screw. The introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as Good Housekeeping and The New Yorker. = Comedies and operas = Oscar Telgmann's opera Leo, the Royal Cadet (1885) includes Judge's Song about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Oscar Wilde's comic short story \\"The Canterville Ghost\\" (1887) has been adapted for film and television on several occasions. In the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as \\"The Cruel Ship's Carpenter\\", \\"The Suffolk Miracle\\", \\"The Unquiet Grave\\" and \\"The Wife of Usher's Well\\". The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region. = Psychological horror = In the Edwardian era, Algernon Blackwood (who combined the ghost story with nature mysticism), Oliver Onions (whose ghost stories drew on psychological horror), and William Hope Hodgson (whose ghost tales also contained elements of the sea story and science fiction) helped move the ghost story in new directions. = Kaidan = Print by Katsushika Hokusai. Illustration for a classical Japanese kaidan story Yotsuya from the series One Hundred Tales (Hyaku monogatari). The ghost of Oiwa manifesting herself as a lantern obake. Kaidan (ÊÄ™Ë´á), which literally means ‚Äúsupernatural tale‚Äù or \\"weird tale\\", is a form of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan entered the vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, led to the creation of a literary genre called Kaidanshu. Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can \\"be funny, or strange, or just telling about an odd thing that happened one time\\". Lafcadio Hearn published Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things in 1904 as a collection of Japanese ghost stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn, and later made into a film.\\"Kwaidan\\", by Brian Stableford, in Frank N. Magill, ed., Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, (pp. 859-860). The book \\"is seen as the first introduction of Japanese superstition to European and American audiences.\\" =Modern era (1920 onward)= Ghost Stories magazine, which contained almost nothing but ghost stories, was published from 1926 to 1932. Beginning in the 1940s, Fritz Leiber wrote ghost tales set in modern industrial settings, such as \\"Smoke Ghost\\" (1941) and \\"A Bit of the Dark World\\" (1962). Shirley Jackson made an important contribution to ghost fiction with her novel The Haunting of Hill House (1959). A noted modern British writer of ghost fiction is Ramsey Campbell. Susan Hill also produced The Woman in Black (1983), a ghost novel that has been adapted for stage, television and film. No√´l Coward's play Blithe Spirit, later made into a 1945 film, places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations.  Film  The Gray Ghost (1917). During the late 1890s the depiction of ghost and supernatural events appear in films. With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres. The works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions, as well as adaptations of other playwrights and novelists. One of the well known short films was Haunted Castle directed by Georges M√©li√®s in 1896. It is also considered as the first silent short film depicting ghost and supernatural events. In 1926 the novel Topper by Thorne Smith was published, which created the modern American ghost. When the novel was adapted into the 1937 movie Topper, it initiated a new film genre and would also influence television.FILM; A Fanciful, Haunting Tale of Influence - The New York Times After the second World War, sentimental depictions of ghosts had become more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968‚Äì70 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944's The Uninvited, and 1945's Dead of Night. The film Blithe Spirit, based on a play by No√´l Coward, was also produced in this period. 1963 saw one of the first major adaptations of a ghost novel, The Haunting, based on the well known novel The Haunting of Hill House. The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's Field of Dreams, the 1990 film Ghost, and the 1993 comedy Heart and Souls. In the horror genre, 1980's The Fog, and the A Nightmare on Elm Street series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence. The 1990s saw a return to classic \\"gothic\\" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films are comedy and mystery from this period include 1984's ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù, 1999's The Sixth Sense and The Others. The 1990s also saw a lighthearted adaptation of the children's character Casper the Friendly Ghost, originally popular in cartoon form in the 1950s and early 1960s, in the feature film Casper. Asian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film Ringu (remade in the US as The Ring in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film The Eye. Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film Chandramukhi have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages. Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts, and usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore. In some cases the Indian films are remakes of western films, such as Anjaane, based on Alejandro Amen√°bar's ghost story The Others.  Television  In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as Ghost Whisperer, Medium, Supernatural, the television series adaptation of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, Danny Phantom, and Scooby-Doo, as well as minor roles in various other television shows. Popularized in part by the 1984 comedy franchise Ghostbusters, ghost hunting has been popularized as a hobby wherein reportedly haunted places are explored. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in paranormal reality television series, such as A Haunting, Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Hunters International, Ghost Lab, and Most Haunted. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as The Ghost Hunter based on the book series of the same name and Ghost Trackers. The Indian television series, Aahat, featured ghost and supernatural stories written by B. P. Singh. It was first aired on 5 October 1995 and ran for more than a decade, ending on 25 November 2010 with more than 450 episodes.

She is the widow of Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) politician Wim Duisenberg who was also the first president of the European Central Bank (ECB). Duisenberg was born as Greetje Nieuwenhuizen into a Protestant family in Heerenveen, Friesland. She later studied nursing. Her first marriage was to the internist Bedier de Prairie, with whom she had three children. At that time she also started using the name Gretta. After their divorce, she became active in left-wing politics, human rights causes, and was briefly involved with Hans van Mierlo, at that time the Dutch Minister of Defense. She married Wim DuisenbergDr. W.F. (Wim) Duisenberg (in Dutch), Parlement & Politiek. Retrieved 5 September 2015. when he was president of De Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank. Gretta Duisenberg came to international attention in 2002 when the media reported that the president of the ECB had a Palestinian flag hanging from his house in Amsterdam. Gretta Duisenberg came under fire when she announced her intention of collecting six million signatures as part of her campaign to draw attention to what she viewed as the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories. She was asked how many signatures she'd been able to gather for the petition and replied that 6,000 supporters had signed so far. And how many signatures would you like to collect, she was asked. Duisenberg hesitated for a moment and then said, \\"Six million\\". Critics stated that the figure was clearly an allusion to the number of Jewish victims of World War II. Duisenberg denied any link to the Holocaust, and stated that she just mentioned a multiple of the 6,000 they had already collected. In a discussion program aired on Dutch TV in November 2005, she stated she understood suicide bombings in the light of what she viewed as the desperate conditions Palestinians are kept in. In the same program, she stated \\"I hope Israel realizes it can't take over the South of Amsterdam the same way it took over the West Bank!\\" referring to the vandalism, complaints, and threats of legal action she received for hanging the Palestinian flag on her property. This statement caused controversy and further intensification of allegations of antisemitism by critics in the Netherlands. In July 2006, the Dutch Public Prosecution (Openbaar Ministerie, OM), after an investigation following a complaint by Dutch lawyer Abraham Moszkowicz, concluded there was no reason to prosecute, as the format of the specific TV programme was meant to incite fierce, possibly controversial and exaggerated reactions. In 2010 the OM saw for the second time no reason to prosecute Duisenberg after allegations of sedition together with members of parliament Harry van Bommel and Sadet Karabulut. This complaint was also filed by Moszkowicz. In early 2014, the pro-Israel group Dutch Center for Documentation and Information on Israel (CIDI), together with anti- discrimination watchdog Dutch Complaint Bureau for Discrimination on the Internet (MDI), filed criminal charges against her in the Netherlands for an article which appeared on her pro-Palestinian website, which claimed to expose \\"the Jewish penetration of the Internet\\" claiming there was a Jewish conspiracy to control the Internet. The article, which is still available on her website, states that \\"The Jews ‚Äî contrary to the ‚Äòliberal‚Äô views they officially say they profess ‚Äî in their suppressive acts practically demonstrate that they always seek to dominate the information flow, they don‚Äôt tolerate any dissent.\\" Duisenberg subsequently denied the article was anti- Semitic and stated that she would not remove it from her website, although she added that \\"material placed on the website does not necessarily reflect our point of view.\\"Complaint filed against Dutch group for ‚ÄòJews control Internet‚Äô article, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), February 10, 2014.Dutch pro- Palestine group defends 'Jews control Internet‚Äô article by Jewish Telegraphic Agency (also published in Haaretz), February 10, 2014.

At the 2006 census, its population was 16,383, in 3,838 families. Ravansar Spring is a huge karst spring located prominently in the city of Ravansar. The area around Ravansar is karstified, the karst ground water emerges in various springs like homonymous Ravansar Spring, which are very important for the supply of drinking water and as the main source of Qara Su River. A general view of Rawansar and its spring in 2017 Archaeology Ravansar has important prehistoric and historical sites, and in this respect it has a special place in the archaeology of the west of Iran. The earliest evidence of human habitation around Ravansar extend back to the Middle Paleolithic that continues to end of glacial period (at least from about 50,000 years to 12,000 years ago), whose remains were found in the caves of the Kolian and Jawri, as well as the Garab River (Awi Kher).Biglari, F., Taheri, K. 2000. The discovery of Upper Paleolithic remains at Mar Kulian and Mar Dalan caves, Rawansar. In: Taheri, K. (Ed.), Essays on the Archaeology, Geology, and Culture of Rawansar Area, Kermanshah. Taq-e Bostan Publications, pp. 7-27 (In Persian). Another important discovery at the region is an elephant molar tooth that dates back to the Pleistocene era and has been discovered near Rawansar. Other important archaeological site is Musaei mound and its two nearby smaller mounds, it has been inhabited since the end of Neolithic period (about 8,000 years ago). Small stone tools called lunates from Epipaleolithic site of Mar Dalan, Rawansar , Kermanshah, Zagros In the course of the Assyrian campaigns into Zagros, Rawansar was one of the bases of this Mesopotamian government that called Nikour, and it was used as a military base in which Assyrian soldiers gathered horses and other goods that were sent to Assyria.Parpola, S. & M. Porter (2001) The Helsinki Atlas of the Near East in the Neo-Assyrian Period, Edited by: Simo Parpola & Michael Porter, The Casco Bay Assyriological Institute The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, Finland. Stronach and Calmeyer proposed Ravansar as a possible candidate for the place of Bit-Istar, an Assyrian town and a local kingdom (c. 12th century BC - c. 710 BC) at western Zagros.

The tomb consists of a small chamber that opens to the east and overlooks the slope. The figure of Ahura Mazda, a person and mass of firewood, appears on the right side of the entrance to this tomb. There is also a pillar base next to the Goni Khani Spring, called \\"Takhti Zangi\\", which may have been created at the same time as the tomb, indicating the presence of a palace or smaller buildings near the spring.Golzari, Massoud., 1994 The Ravansar rock-cut tomb, and three Islamic tombstones. Proceedings of the First Archaeological Symposium in Iran after the Islamic Revolution, Susa, 14‚Äì17 April 1994. Therefore, during the Achaemenid period, Rawansar was probably one of the important centers of this government in the west of the country. In the Parthian period, Rawansar was a small town in the west of the present town which today is close to a spring called Kani Wayan (near the police station). From the Sassanid period, a collection of silverware has been discovered in Quri Qala Cave. There was also a cemetery from the Safavid period on the northern slopes of Qola Mount. The gravestones exhibiting the Kofi scripts, which unfortunately have been looted or broken in recent decades. This Safavid cemetery shows the importance of Ravansar in the Safavid period.

It was named after the German mineralogist Heinrich Vater. It is also known as mu-calcium carbonate (Œº-CaCO3) and has a JCPDS number of 13-192. Vaterite belongs to the hexagonal crystal system, whereas calcite is trigonal and aragonite is orthorhombic. Vaterite, like aragonite, is a metastable phase of calcium carbonate at ambient conditions at the surface of the earth. As it is less stable than either calcite or aragonite, vaterite has a higher solubility than either of these phases. Therefore, once vaterite is exposed to water, it converts to calcite (at low temperature) or aragonite (at high temperature: ~60 ¬∞C). At 37 ¬∞C for example a solution-mediated transition from vaterite to calcite occurs, where the latter one dissolves and subsequently precipitates as calcite assisted by an Ostwald ripening process. However, vaterite does occur naturally in mineral springs, organic tissue, gallstones, urinary calculi and plants. In those circumstances, some impurities (metal ions or organic matter) may stabilize the vaterite and prevent its transformation into calcite or aragonite. Vaterite is usually colorless, its shape is spherical, and its diameter is small, ranging from 0.05 to 5 Œºm. Vaterite can be produced as the first mineral deposits repairing natural or experimentally-induced shell damage in some aragonite-shelled mollusks (e.g. gastropods). Subsequent shell deposition occurs as aragonite. In 2018, vaterite was identified as a constituent of a deposit formed on the leaves of Saxifraga at Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Vaterites of the locality San Vito (Monte Somma, Italy) are microcrystalline with largest crystals below 2 mm size. This vaterite is epitactic after aragonite. The crystal contains triplet of aragonite inside of it. On its termination twin seams of aragonite triplet are well visible.

Musaphia was probably born in Spain. He married Sara Abigail da Silva, daughter of Semuel da Silva, in 1628. Their sons and grandsons joined the court of the Gottorps, and a daughter was married to Gabriel Milan, who would later be appointed governor of the Danish West-Indies (now U.S. Virgin Islands). Around this time, Musaphia graduated from the Padua medical school, which was regarded as the best of its kind at the time.  Publications  After Sara's death on August 7, 1634, Musaphia dedicated Zekher Rav, an adaptation of the creation myth in which all Hebrew word roots are used exactly once, to her. It was first published in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1635, and a second edition with a Latin translation was published in Hamburg in 1638. Another work was published in 1640, namely Sacro-Medic√¶ Sententi√¶ ex Bibliis, a medical treatise containing about 800 sentences on medicine. It contained a section on alchemy that created some stirring at the time. Musaphia also dedicated a work on ebb and flow to Christian IV of Denmark in 1642.  Career  In 1646, while living in Gl√ºckstadt, Holstein, Musaphia was appointed royal physician to the Danish court by Christian IV. Around 1648, probably in connection with the death of Christian IV, Musaphia went to Amsterdam and joined the college of rabbis. In 1655, he published an extended version of Nathan ben Jehiels Talmudic dictionary Aruk (ca. 1100), titled Musaf he-'Aruk, detailing many Jewish customs. The preface states that he had been collecting this information since a young boy. Musaphia was also working on a revised version of the Talmud, which was nevertheless never published, and the manuscripts have since been lost.  Personal life and family  In the mid-1660s, Musaphia was caught up in the Sabbateans movement, which proclaimed that Sabbatai Zevi was the new Messiah. His brother Albert Dionis was one of the wealthiest Jews in Hamburg in 1614.Terslin, Milan, 9 Musaphia died in 1675, in Amsterdam.  Sources  * H. C.

It currently serves as a local museum and also as a venue for civil ceremonies and private functions. It is a Grade I listed building. History The banqueting hall St. Mary's Guild in Boston was founded as a merchant guild by a group of individuals in 1260.Reply to the King's writ of enquiry of 1389 The guildhall, based on evidence from dendrochronology, was built in 1390, just two years before incorporation of the guild and probably in anticipation of that event. The guild became wealthy as a result of extensive gifts received in the 14th and 15th centuries and an inventory shows that it held various items of gold, silver and gilt, as well as the sacred relics. As a result of the dissolution of the chantries and religious guilds, imposed by King Edward VI, the guildhall was confiscated by the Crown and passed to the Boston Corporation in 1555. In autumn 1607 a group of Puritans led by William Brewster, now known to as the Pilgrim Fathers, were brought before the magistrates in the guildhall, accused of seeking to travel to Holland without the King's permission. They were discharged by the magistrates and lived in Boston for several months before reaching Holland the following year by another route; they later sailed from Plymouth in the Mayflower for the New World in 1620. As the building was increasingly used for civic purposes in the 18th century, ongoing changes were put in place which removed or masked much of the building's medieval fabric. Pishey Thompson, writing in 1856, claimed that \\"the interior of the building is so completely modernised that nothing of the original but the construction of the roof is visible\\". After the new Sessions House in Church Close was completed in 1842, the guildhall ceased to be a place for the administration of justice, and after the new Municipal Buildings in West Street were completed in 1904, the guildhall ceased to have any municipal role. The guildhall operated a restaurant which served as a National Soup Kitchen in the First World War and as a British Restaurant in the Second World War but was forced to close after an outbreak of food poisoning in 1949. The whole building was expensively restored after receiving ¬£1 million in support from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2008. Architecture The walls consist of two faces of brickwork between which is a rubble core matrix. The bonding of the brickwork is characteristic of a late medieval date. Irregular shaped bricks are laid in a fairly thick mortar and in a haphazard bond consisting largely of rows of stretchers with the occasional header used to bond the two wall surfaces together. This construction pre- dated the widespread adoption of English Bond (alternating courses of headers and stretchers) and Flemish Bond (alternating headers and stretchers in each course) in England. The courses of brickwork are bonded together with a lime- based 'common mortar' which was originally pointed back flush with the wall face. It survives on the bedding planes and is exposed in several places on the north elevation. Guildhall collection Works of art include a portrait, painted by Thomas Phillips, of Sir Joseph Banks, recorder of Boston in 1813, who sailed with Captain James Cook aboard the Endeavour on the first great voyage to discover Australia. The guildhall also holds a copy of Foxe's Book of Martyrs and artefacts from various archaeological excavations.

It was founded in 1218 from Havre d'Olonne by Savary I de Maul√©on, the Lord of Maul√©on, S√©n√©chal of Poitou and prince of Talmont. Its history is tied to the ocean for which it has served as a port and point of maritime commerce. Louis XI separated Les Sables d'Olonne from the town of Olonne in 1472. It became the largest cod-fishing port in France, with 14,000 inhabitants, in the 17th century. During the French Revolution, unlike the surrounding Vend√©e, the city supported the Republic, and so was often besieged‚Äîunsuccessfully, because of its port. The current local tourism industry traces its roots to bathing establishments, first begun in 1825. Rail service reached Les Sables on 29 December 1866, via the line from La Roche-sur-Yon, Bressuire, Saumur, and Tours; express service to and from Paris would arrive in 1971. The city's port served as a base port for American Expeditionary Forces during World War I.Germany occupied Les Sables d'Olonne during World War II and, upon evacuation of that army at war's end, the German army made an effort to destroy the port, and mined the harbor. Interests and events The Vend√©e Globe yacht race, which takes place every four years, starts and ends at Les Sables-d'Olonne. The Mus√©e de l'Abbaye Sainte-Croix is a municipal museum situated in a 17th-century building that is devoted to modern and contemporary art, and that has \\"Mus√©e de France\\" status.

A single serving is packaged in a foam food container, or else a plastic or paper cup. Other brand names are used in specific countries, as in the singular Cup Noodle in Japan. The product has inspired numerous competing products, such as Maruchan's Instant Lunch.  History  Instant noodles were invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-born founder of the Japanese food company Nissin. He used Chicken Ramen as the first instant ramen noodles. In 1970, Nissin formed the subsidiary Nissin Foods (USA) Co. Inc., to sell instant noodles in the United States. Nissin recognized that the bowls traditionally used to package instant noodles in Asia were not common in the US, so the paper cup was designed by Ron R. Matteson. In 1971, Nissin introduced instant ramen packaged in a styrofoam cup. The three original Cup O' Noodles flavors in the US were beef, chicken and shrimp; pork flavor was added in 1976. All flavors originally contained pieces of dehydrated egg which was removed in the early 1980s. In 1978, Nissin Foods offered more new varieties of Top Ramen and Cup O' Noodles. The product was known as Cup O' Noodles in the United States until 1993.Nissin History In 1998, Cup Noodles Hot Sauce Varieties were introduced (Beef, Chicken, Pork and Shrimp). = Today = German Cup Nudeln (Spicy flavor), old packaging Today, instant noodles in Japan are often sold in foam bowls, sometimes with plastic utensils. Foam bowls are inexpensive, disposable, light, and easy to hold, since they insulate heat well. Different flavors are available in other parts of the world, such as tom yum in Thailand, curry in Japan, crab in Hong Kong, and churrasco in Brazil.Japanese Cup Noodle official website has the section \\"The Cupnoodle in the world\\" under the \\"Library\\", which lists Cup Noodles flavors all over the world. In 2016 the US version was changed, reducing sodium and removing MSG and artificial flavors.  In popular culture  From 1996 to 2006, a Nissin Cup Noodle sign was installed in Times Square, New York City. It was located prominently near the top of the One Times Square building, the location of the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve. The sign was the most recent example in a tradition of steaming signs in Times Square, which started with an A&P; 8 O'Clock Coffee cup in 1933.New York Architecture Images- Midtown- times square short history 1 Cup Noodles are often seen in the 2012 video game Binary Domain, which is set in a futuristic version of Tokyo.

Its source is in the Haute-Vienne d√©partement at Ch√©ronnac, a small village near Rochechouart. It flows through the departments of Haute-Vienne, Charente, Vienne and Charente- Maritime. The river flows into the Atlantic Ocean near Rochefort. Navigation The Charente was described by the French king Fran√ßois I as 'the most beautiful river in the kingdom', and was navigable in its natural state until mills were erected at many locations in the 14th century. Some locks were built but through navigation remained impossible for centuries. Improvements to the navigation were projected under Louis XVI in 1772, but work was interrupted by the Revolution. The project was revived under the Restoration and canalisation completed in 1835. The waterway was abandoned in 1957. The d√©partements took over operation in 1963, and recreational vessels have now taken possession of the waterway throughout the 164 km to the town of Angoul√™me.

","title":"Hercules' Club"},{"id":"1123918","text":"Aralia spinosa, commonly known as devil's walking stick, is a woody species of plant in the genus Aralia, family Araliaceae, native to eastern North America. The various names refer to the viciously sharp, spiny stems, petioles, and even leaf midribs. It has also been known as Angelica-tree. This species is sometimes called Hercules' club, prickly ash, or prickly elder, common names it shares with the unrelated Zanthoxylum clava-herculis. For this reason, Aralia spinosa is sometimes confused with that species and mistakenly called the toothache tree, but it does not have the medicinal properties of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis. Aralia spinosa is occasionally cultivated for its exotic, tropical appearance, having large lacy compound leaves. It is closely related to the Asian species Aralia elata, a more commonly cultivated species with which it is easily confused. Description Aralia spinosa is an aromatic spiny deciduous shrub or small tree growing tall, with a simple or occasionally branched stem with very large bipinnate leaves long. The trunks are up to in diameter, with the plants umbrella-like in habit with open crowns. The young stems are stout and thickly covered with sharp spines. The plants generally grow in clusters of branchless trunks, although stout wide- spreading branches are occasionally produced. The flowers are creamy-white, individually small (about 5 mm or 0.2 in across) but produced in large composite panicles long; flowering is in the late summer. The fruit is a purplish-black berry in diameter, ripening in the fall. The roots are thick and fleshy. The doubly or triply compound leaves are the largest of any temperate tree in the continental United States, often about a meter (three feet) long and 60 cm (two feet) wide, with leaflets about long. The petioles are prickly, with swollen bases. In the autumn the leaves turn to a peculiar bronze red touched with yellow which makes the tree conspicuous and attractive. The habit of growth and general appearance of Aralia spinosa and related tree-forming Aralia species are unique. It is usually found as a group of unbranched stems, rising to the height of , which bear upon their summits a crowded cluster of doubly or triply compound leaves, thus giving to each stem a certain tropical palm-like appearance. In the south it is said to reach the height of , still retaining its palm-like aspect. However, further north, the slender, swaying, palm-like appearance is most characteristic of younger plants that have not been damaged by winter storms. The trunk, showing the bark, leaf scars, and spines. * Bark: Light brown, divided into rounded broken ridges. Branchlets one-half to two-thirds of an inch in diameter, armed with stout, straight or curved, scattered prickles and nearly encircled by narrow leaf scars. At first light yellow brown, shining and dotted, later light brown. * Wood: Brown with yellow streaks; light, soft, brittle, close-grained. * Winter buds: Terminal bud chestnut brown, one-half to three-fourths of an inch long, conical, blunt; axillary buds flattened, triangular, one-fourth of an inch in length. * Leaves: Clustered at the end of the branches, compound, bi- and tri-pinnate, three to four feet long, two and a half feet broad. The pinnae are unequally pinnate, having five or six pairs of leaflets and a long stalked terminal leaflet; these leaflets are often themselves pinnate. The last leaflets are ovate, two to three inches long, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate or dentate, acute; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud a bronze green, shining, somewhat hairy; when full grown are dark green above, pale beneath; midribs frequently furnished with prickles. Petioles stout, light brown, eighteen to twenty inches in length, clasping, armed with prickles. Stipules acute, one-half inch long. * Flowers: July, August. Perfect or polygamomonoecious, cream white, borne in many-flowered umbels arranged in compound panicles, forming a terminal racemose cluster, three to four feet in length which rises, solitary or two or three together, above the spreading leaves. Bracts and bractlets lanceolate, acute, persistent. * Calyx: Calyx tube coherent with the ovary, minutely five- toothed. * Corolla: Petals five, white, inserted on margin of the disk, acute, slightly inflexed at the apex, imbricate in bud. * Stamens: Five, inserted on margin of the disk, alternate with the petals; filaments thread-like; anthers oblong, attached on the back, introrse, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally. * Pistil: Ovary inferior, five-celled; styles five, connivent; stigmas capitate. * Fruit: Berry-like drupe, globular, black, one-fourth of an inch long, five-angled, crowned with the blackened styles. Flesh thin, dark. Distribution and habitat Aralia spinosa is widespread in the eastern United States, ranging from New York to Florida along the Atlantic coast, and westward to Ohio, Illinois, and Texas. It prefers a deep moist soil. The plants typically grow in the forest understory or at the edges of forests, often forming clonal thickets by sprouting from the roots. This tree was admired by the Iroquois because of its usefulness, and for its rarity. The Iroquois would take the saplings of the tree and plant them near their villages and on islands, so that animals wouldn't eat the valuable fruit. The fruit was used in many of the natives' foods. The women would take the flowers and put them in their hair because of the lemony smell. The flowers could also be traded for money. In the past, botanists attributed occurrences of Aralia north of Maryland and Delaware in the Middle Atlantic states to introductions of Aralia spinosa from areas to the south. However some of these occurrences are now known to be of Aralia elata (Japanese Angelica-tree), a related Asian species that is invasive in the area. A. spinosa and A. elata are difficult to distinguish in the field, leading to confusion. In at least one locality, in Philadelphia, A. elata is displacing A. spinosa, with as yet unknown impacts on the local ecology. Uses The young leaves can be eaten if gathered before the prickles harden. They are then chopped finely and cooked as a potherb. Aralia spinosa was introduced into cultivation in 1688 and is still grown for its decorative foliage, prickly stems, large showy flower panicles [clusters], and distinctive fall color. These plants are slow growing, tough and durable, do well in urban settings, but bear numerous prickles on their stems, petioles, and leaflets. These plants can be propagated from seeds or root cuttings.Poor, Janet Meakin, and Nancy P. Brewster. 1994. Plants that merit attention Vol 2, Shrubs. Portland, OR: Timber Press. Page 34. Early American settlers used the plant for its alleged properties of curing toothaches. In a laboratory study, extracts from the plant, used as a medicine during the American Civil War, showed antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with wound infections.

However, this cost him his own life in the following power struggle within the Communist Party of China. Early life Wang Zuo was born in a Hakka village in Suichuan County, Jiangxi just south of Jinggangshan City. Wang's family was poor and his father died when he was young. The family did not have enough money for the burial, and as a result, lost the tiny piece of land they had to a local landlord who provided the money in the form of usury. Wang Zuo had to work as cowherd and gathering firewoods for the very landlord who provided usury. At the age of 15, Wang Zuo became a tailor by trade, and it was during this time he became a student of a famous local kung fu master, Wang Dongwen (), and became an expert in martial arts. Witnessing the hopeless struggle of local peasantry via legal means in the reign of corrupted Beiyang warlords, the disillusioned Wang Zuo joined the \\"Green Forest\\" () bandits commanded By Zhu Longzi () in 1923 and rose in ranks, though his contact with bandits could be as early as in 1921 via his kung fu master, Wang Dongwen. Wang was liked by everyone in the gang and soon supplanted the gang's leader, Zhu Kongyang (). In 1924, Wang Zuo became independent and formed his own gangs, which occupied the village of Dajing, which controlled the passes up Mount Jinggangshan, as their stronghold. Wang himself commandeered the large house of a former landlord as his own. He was recognised as superior by smaller bandit groups and came to be known locally as the \\"Great King of the Mountain\\" (). Around 1924, the \\"Horse and Sword Brigade\\", formerly subordinate to Wang, came under the independent leadership of Yuan Wencai. In 1925, Wang's subordinate staged a coup and Wang was forced to flee to Yuan, who helped him to reestablish himself. Wang and Yuan became sworn brothers and their two groups maintained close ties and cooperated to defend against the county authorities, with Yuan's force was stationed at the foothills at Maoping, while Wang's force was stationed in the mountains at higher elevation at Greater and Lesser Five Wells (Daxiaowujing ). Wang Zuo eventually developed the reputation of a local Robin Hood. A peasant song from the 1920s celebrates his deeds: :Nandougu, a tiger sitting in the mountain, :Beating the landlord, helping the poor. :Famed in the mountains and on the plains, :As a king on the mountain eating the wealthy. However, Wang Zuo gained most of his fame for his martial arts expertise in an ambush: once the unarmed Wang was along in a yard of a landlord and was suddenly besieged by more than a dozen members of landlord's militia in the pre-planned ambush. Grabbing a bench as a weapon, Wang knocked out the landlord's militia members who were closest to him and jumped onto the roof from the ground, and safely escaped without any injury. Experience like this elevated Wang's status among the local populace. Early communist era Under the influence of Yuan Wencai, Wang Zuo came into contact with the local Communists in Suichuan (ÈÅÇÂ∑ù) county around 1925, and his group were recognized as a peasant self-defence force in 1926. After the April 12 Incident, Wang Zuo, like Yuan Wencai, decided to stay with communist side, and became the only two surviving communist forces locally, each had around sixty rifles respectively. Both Yuan and Wang adopted new strategies when they resumed their banditry activities for survival in that they had only targeted the richest landlords and merchants who were mostly hated by the general population. In doing so, they had managed not only to win the support of lower and lower-middle classes, but also that of many members of the middle class such as small business owners. Consequently, this successful practice also became the source of their crimes they were accused of in their subsequent downfall, when their future comrades accused them for being \\"Not carrying out the revolution completely\\" and \\"Being rightist\\". Due to the popular support from those with better economic status, the communists were able to secure a steady supply of provisions needed via trade, and helped with properties confiscated from the richest local strongmen, the communists became bolder and concentrated on guerrilla warfare against local governmental forces which were incapable of exterminating Yuan's and Wang's forces due to the strong popular support the communists enjoyed. However, Wang and his men had heavier influence of banditry than Yuan and his men, and although Wang enjoyed almost exclusive popular support of lower class like Yuan, his popular support from the middle class was not as great as that of Yuan Wencai. Because of this and his location deep in the mountains, Wang Zuo and his men were not as active as Yuan Wencai and his men in their guerrilla warfare against the local nationalist government. Nonetheless, in July 1927, under the order of communists, Yuan's men and Wang's men raided Yongxin (Ê∞∏Êñ∞) county, freeing over 80 Communist Party agents held in the local jail converted from a gaol. Although the town was briefly occupied, it was obvious that it was impossible for the token communist force to hold the town and thus they soon withdrew to the mountains to continue their guerrilla warfare. Joining Mao Zedong On September 30, 1927, Mao Zedong arrived at Sanwan (‰∏âÊπæ) village of Yongxin (Ê∞∏Êñ∞) county, just north of Jinggangshan, with the remnants from the abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising, and sent letters to both Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo to ask their help to establish a communist base locally. On October 3, 1927, Mao's force reached the town of Ninggang (ÂÆÅÂÜà) and held a conference, at which Mao personally vetoed the suggestion to eliminate Yuan and Wang by force, and quickly established an alliance with Yuan Wencai. Wang Zuo actively seek to establish contact with Mao and in the late October, 1927, he successfully did so. With the help of Yuan Wencai, Wang met Mao Zedong at the village of Greater Well (Dajing, Â§ß‰∫ï) on October 24, 1927. Wang Zuo was initially somewhat wary, but as with Yuan, Mao approached Wang with a large gift of seventy rifles and horse saddles, and the offer of Communist instructors to give his force military training, thus successfully convinced Wang to welcome him into Wang's base at Ciping (Ëå®Âù™) on October 27, 1927. Wang provided Mao's men with 25 tons of rice and huge amount of money soon afterward. Mao Zedong sent only one cadre, He Changgong (‰ΩïÈïøÂ∑•) to assist Wang Zuo as the trainer and communist party representative, and He Changgong (‰ΩïÈïøÂ∑•) helped him defeat a landlord militia unit headed by Yin Daoyi (Â∞πÈÅì‰∏Ä), which had been harassing his men, he was won over. As winter approached, Mao withdrew from his forward base of Maoping to defend Jinggangshan from Dajing. In February 1928, the forces of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were officially incorporated into the regular communist army as the 1st Army, 1st Division, 2nd Regiment. Yuan was named as the regimental commander, and Wang as the deputy regimental commander, with He Changgong as the communist party representative (‰ΩïÈïøÂ∑•). On February 17, they participated in a successful attack at Xincheng on a battalion of the Kuomintang's Jiangxi Army, killing the enemy commander and taking more than a hundred prisoners. Wang Zuo joined the Communist Party of China in April 1928. However, it must be said for Wang Zuo, it was more accurate to say he joined Mao Zedong's clique than the Communist Party of China, since his loyalty was mostly to Mao personally, instead of to the communist party, which eventually caused his downfall and final death when Mao lost the power struggle with Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa. Soon afterwards, Wang accompanied Mao Zedong to Lingxian county in southern Hunan province in aid of Zhu De. Jinggangshan had meanwhile been overrun by landlord militia and had to be reconquered. After Zhu De's soldiers joined the Jinggangshan base, they were merged with the existing forces to become the Fourth \\"Red Army\\". Yuan and Wang's 2nd Regiment was renamed the 32nd Regiment. Later in the year, Zhu De's 28th and 29th regiments crossed into Hunan. The 32nd Regiment was given the assignment of securing Maoping from the advance of the Kuomintang's Jiangxi units until his return. In January 1929, the bulk of the Red Army left Jinggangshan to establish a new base at Ruijin, leaving around 800 ex- Kuomintang troops under Peng Dehuai. Just after the New Year, it was agreed that Peng's men and the 32nd Regiment of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai should stay behind to defend Jinggangshan. Under intense pressure for about a week, Peng gathered together his three surviving companies and broke through the enemy blockade with heavy casualties. For the next year Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo survived with their men in the mountains and may have returned to banditry in their guerrilla warfare. The Kuomintang's repeated mop up operations against them proved to be futile because the communist forces only confiscated property from wealthy landlords, and distributing to peasants. As a result, such banditry was viewed positively by the local general populace, which refused to corporate with the Kuomintang forces. Prelude to downfall Jinggangshan and Jiangxi Soviet were not immune to the power struggles within the Communist Party of China in the early 1930s. Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan succeeded in rising to power under the direction and support of the Comintern and their extreme leftist policy inevitably effected all communist bases in China, including Jinggangshan. The extreme leftism of the new communist leadership included what Mao Zedong called military adventurism, which included attempts to take over the large cities, a result of unrealistic optimism on the Chinese revolution and a direct copy of the Soviet model of urban revolution. The new strategy was obvious unfit for China at the time, and many commanders such as Peng Dehuai, Zhu De and Chen Yi voiced their opposition, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai included, but it was useless because the new leadership refused to change its policy. As a result, the communist forces met disastrous defeats in attempts to carry out this unrealistic policy. Mao Zedong strongly opposed the military adventurism of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan, but lost and was temporarily forced out of the communist leadership and sent to southern Jiangxi. Although Mao's new position appeared to have the equal rank, in reality Mao was demoted. Furthermore, during the 6th National Conference of Communist Party of China held from June to July 1928 in Moscow, the top brass of communists passed the resolution on the \\"Organizational Problems of Soviet Government\\" (ÂÖ≥‰∫éËãèÁª¥ÂüÉÊîøÊùÉÁªÑÁªáÈóÆÈ¢òÂÜ≥ËÆÆÊ°à), in which it clearly stated that the bandits could only be utilized before the success of uprising, but afterward, they must be eliminated. This resolution had provided excellent ammo for Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa in their power struggle against Mao, and people like Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were obviously targets. However, the political struggle did not end at the top leadership of the communists. In contrast to the professional soldier Peng Dehuai who faithfully attempted to carry out the impossible missions by dutifully obeying the orders despite his personal opposition, which ended in obvious defeats, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only voiced their opposition in words, but also carried it out in action by simply refusing to obey the unrealistic orders from the new communist party leadership and continued to practice Mao Zedong's strategy. The result of their actions was the obvious success that enabled Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to have most of their force preserved. However, the relative success of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only proved to be useless in helping them within the communist party, but it also served as a catalyst of their downfall because their success of preserving their own forces was viewed as an urgent threat by the new communist leadership, since with greater military force, it was more difficult to remove them politically. With their primary supporter and protector Mao Zedong falling out from power, Wang Zuo's and Yuan Wencai's days were numbered. When the resolution from the communist 6th National Conference held in the mid-1928 in Moscow reached the communist base in Jinggangshan, it was already winter. In the beginning of 1929, Mao held the Bailu (ÊüèÈú≤) Conference to discuss the issue. Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), the communist party secretary of Yongxin (Ê∞∏Êñ∞) county and You Chaoqing (Â∞§Ë∂ÖÊ∏Ö), the communist party secretary of Ninggang (ÂÆÅÂÜà) county, who had been at odds with Yuan and Wang insisted on executing Yuan and Wang according to the resolution but their suggestion was once again vetoed by Mao. The resulting decision was a compromise that Wang would remain to command forces in the communist base, while Yuan would be named as the chief-of-staff and deployed with the communist force striking southern Jiangxi. Death In the late night of February 23, 1930, Peng Dehuai was awakened from his bed by Xiang Zhongfa's and Li Lisan's two lieutenants, the local party secretaries Zhu Changxie (Êú±ÊòåÂÅï) and Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), who told Peng that they had just received intelligence claiming Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai had defected to Kuomintang], and thus they need Peng's signature to deploy troops to exterminate the traitors. Ironically, one of the supporters of Zhu Changxie (Êú±ÊòåÂÅï) and Wang Huai (ÁéãÊÄÄ), You Chaoqing (Â∞§Ë∂ÖÊ∏Ö), was the one who introduced Wang and Yuan to the communists. Knowing both Wang and Yuan would not do such thing, Peng initially refused and argued with them to defend Wang and Yuan. The three lieutenants of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan then changed their story by claiming that the intelligence indeed appeared to be a rumor, and they were to be invited to a meeting to clear things up, some force would be deployed just in case. Sensing Peng Dehuai's opposition, the three also asked Peng not to be involved by staying where he was instead of going to the planned meeting, for the sake of not to agitate situation. This tactic finally convinced Peng Dehuai who give his signature, and the three men led over 300 troops away to plot their next move. After leaving Peng Dehuai's camp, the three immediately faked Mao Zedong's order to lure both Yuan and Wang to the supposed meeting to discuss the military situation. But once Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai reached the meeting, they were shot in obscure circumstances, allegedly ambushed while trying to rebel. Wang managed to escape out a window but drowned while attempting to cross a river. Legacy As early as October of that year, Mao Zedong criticised the officials in power of the Jiangxi Soviet for the assassination of his old allies. Just who gave the order for the death of Wang Zuo, however, is still not clear, although a number of officials of the Jiangxi Communist Party were implicated. Wang Yunlong (ÁéãÈõ≤ÈöÜ), Wang Zuo's younger brother and an officer of the 32nd Regiment, became the new leader of his brother's men, and defected to Kuomintang. After Wang Yunlong (ÁéãÈõ≤ÈöÜ)'s death, Wang Zuo's son became the leader and it was not until nearly two decades later in 1949 when the communists were finally able to retake Jinggangshan. After 1949, both Yuan and Wang were marked as examples of ideologically reformed bandits who had been transformed into Communist soldiers. Both were recognised as martyrs of the Chinese Revolution. In 1951 Wang's grave was moved to Dajing, where a monument was erected in his honour. Although Peng Dehuai was not directly involved in the death of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo, as proved by the history, that did not prevent Mao Zedong from blaming it on Peng, and Peng Dehuai was persecuted 30 years later, the death of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai was one of the alleged crime Peng committed against Mao, and this alleged crime again appeared during the Cultural Revolution when Peng Dehuai was struggled by the Red Guards.

It is a non-commercial college radio station that plays many styles of music broadly classified under rock, specialty, fine arts, alternative music and Latin jazz. KXLU has a small, cult following among music fans in the general Los √Ångeles metropolitan area. The station's rock programming runs between 2am and 6pm on weekdays and the hosts during this time are predominantly college students. Specialty shows include \\"Stray Pop\\" hosted by Stella, \\"Music For Nimrods\\" hosted by Reverend Dan, \\"She Rocks\\" hosted by McAllister, Biancadonk and Cass Monster, \\"In a Dream\\" hosted by Mystic Pete, \\"The Bomb Shelter\\" hosted by Uncle Tim, \\"Livation\\" hosted by Robert Douglas and Hilary Russell, \\"The Molotov Cocktail Hour\\" hosted by Cyrano & Se√±or Amor, \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" hosted by Taylor 2000, \\"Neuz Pollution\\" hosted by Chris Candy and Maki, \\"Demolisten\\" hosted by Fred and Sean Carnage, and \\"A Fistful Of Vinyl\\" hosted by Alec & John, \\"Center Stage\\" hosted by Mark Gordon, among other programs.

KXLU Demolisten history The show began in 1984 when \\"DJ Agent Ava\\" took a couple reel-to- reel tapes of Jane's Addiction and Faith No More, and decided to start a radio show of nothing but demo tapes. Once word got out about the show, she soon acquired demos from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Guns N' Roses, The Jesus and Mary Chain and others. Perry Farrell, in the book Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction said, \\"The cool thing about KXLU's Demolisten show was if you were a local band you could just call in, request your song and if you went down there, they would interview you... I was listening to KXLU all day long because that's where all the good music was. The rest of the world was out of it.\\" The early 1990s DJs featured Fred Kiko, Chad, and Tony Kiewel. They've often been credited with the discovery of Beck, who donated a track to the Demolisten: Volume 2 CD, and also played music by Jimmy Tamborello (The Postal Service, Dntel), who was a friend and fellow KXLU DJ at the time. Tony Kiewel left the show for an A&R; position at Sub Pop Records in 2000. The early 2000s continued to feature Fred, with Devin Valdesuso and Doug Jones (label owner of Kittridge Records). Hosts have included the International Voice of Reason AKA IVOR, and others. In 2002, Fred was joined by co-host Octavius Poirier (former guitarist for Artichoke and Chewing Foil). Audio archives of KXLU Demolisten have been saved online since 2003.

He was a vocal proponent of democracy, aggressively advocating free elections for Kenya. Biography Hempstone attended George Washington University and graduated from the University of the South. He was a U.S. Marine in the Korean War (1950-52), leaving as a captain. He did radio rewrite for the Associated Press in Charlotte, North Carolina, (1952). He was a reporter at the Louisville Times, Louisville, Kentucky (1953), rewrite man at National Geographic, Washington, D.C. (1954), then a reporter at the Washington Star (1955-56). He was a fellow of the Institute of Current World Affairs in Africa (1956-60). He served as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News in Africa (1961-64) and in Latin America (1965). He was a foreign correspondent for the Washington Star in Latin America (1966), and Europe, (1967-69). He was associate editor and editorial page director of the Star (1970-75). He left the Star in 1975 after a disagreement with Joe L. Allbritton, its new owner. He wrote a syndicated twice-weekly column, \\"Our Times,\\" beginning 1975. Hempstone worked as the Africa correspondent for The Chicago Daily News, wrote several books, and wrote a syndicated column carried by 90 newspapers. In 1982 he was named executive editor of the newly founded Washington Times and, following the resignation of editor and publisher James R. Whelan in 1984, briefly served as editor of the paper before being replaced by Arnaud de Borchgrave. He was appointed ambassador to Kenya by George H. W. Bush in 1989, a time when the United States was beginning to push African countries toward democracy and human rights. Hempstone worked toward these goals by fighting for multiparty elections in Kenya in 1991, nine years after Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi had banned all parties except his own. The Moi administration derided him, saying he failed to understand that strong, unified government was necessary to keep Kenya's tribal groups from splitting the country. He aided dissidents and befriended opponents of the administration, causing the African press to describe his style as \\"bulldozer diplomacy.\\" The Kenyan government isolated him and, according to Hempstone's book Rogue Ambassador: An African Memoir, twice attempted to kill him. Multiparty elections were ultimately held in 1992, and were won by Moi with 36 percent of the vote. In 2001 former Kenyan government minister Nicholas Biwott successfully sued Hempstone (High Court Civil Suit Case No. 1273) for suggesting in his autobiography that Biwott had been involved in the murder of Kenya's minister of foreign Affairs, Dr. Robert Ouko, in February 1990. Hempstone did not defend the action. Hempstone died in 2006 in Suburban Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, from complications of diabetes.

He was noted for representing Nelson Mandela during the Rivonia Trial. He instructed Mandela to add the qualification \\"if needs be\\" to his trial address, which is credited with sparing him from a sentence of death. Bizos also represented the families of anti-apartheid activists killed by the government, throughout the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Early life  Bizos was the son of Antonios \\"Antoni\\" Bizos, the mayor of the small village of Vasilitsi, south of Koroni and Kalamata on the Messenia peninsula of the Peloponnese, Greece. He was born on 14 November 1927, although this was erroneously recorded on his South African identity documents as 1928, owing to his father's declaration to the authorities upon arrival in Egypt. In May 1941 at the age of thirteen, Bizos and his father helped seven New Zealand Army soldiers (Don Gladding, Mick Karup, Peter Martin, John Lewis and three others) who were hiding in the hills to escape the German-occupied Greek mainland for Crete. The 9 set out to sea at night, with only a cheap compass and a map torn from an atlas, intending to escape to Crete. On the second day at sea, rough winds took the sail out of control and tore through its canvas. The men had to take turns to row, right through the night, until they managed to repair the sail. On the third day, they spotted a ship in the distance. They managed to attract the attention of the crew of what turned out to be the British destroyer, HMS Kimberley, on its way to the Battle of Crete. After the battle, the Kimberley dropped him and his father off at Alexandria, Egypt. As a refugee, Bizos was sent to the Union of South Africa and landed in Durban. From there he went by train to Johannesburg, disembarking at the Braamfontein railway station. At the time, the Ossewabrandwag, an Afrikaner group with Nazi sympathies, were demonstrating against the arrival of refugees. The Ossewabrandwag blamed Jan Smuts for bringing the vuilgoed (rubbish) of Europe to South Africa. The local Greek community helped integrate him into society. Bizos did not go to school for his first two years in the country as he spoke neither English nor Afrikaans. He gained entry to the University of the Witwatersrand in 1949, where he met Nelson Mandela and undertook a 3-year Bachelor of Arts degree, followed by a three-year LLB law degree. It was during this time that he first became politically active, joining the Students' Representative Council under the leadership of Harold Wolpe.  Legal career  =Apartheid era= Mural incorporating Mandela's speech from the Rivonia Trial of 1963-64 Bizos joined the Bar in Johannesburg in 1954. During the 1950s and 1960s he was counsel to a wide range of well-known people including Trevor Huddleston of Sophiatown. At the Rivonia Trial from 1963 to 1964, Bizos was part of the team that defended Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu. The accused were sentenced to life imprisonment, but spared the death penalty. Although it is sometimes said that he claims to have drafted Mandela's famous speech spoken at the trial, he says that his main contribution was to advise the use of the words \\"if needs be\\" before Mandela said that he was prepared to die. Bizos believed that this may have contributed to the avoidance of the death penalty, by having Mandela not appear to seek martyrdom. This trial heralded the arrival of a group of tough human rights lawyers ‚Äì Joel Joffe, Harry Schwarz, Arthur Chaskalson and Harold Hanson. Bizos subsequently became a senior member of the Johannesburg Bar in 1978. He was a member of the National Council of Lawyers for Human Rights, which he helped found in 1979. He was Senior Counsel at the Legal Resources Centre in Johannesburg in the Constitutional Litigation Unit. He also served as a judge on Botswana's Court of Appeal from 1985 to 1993. =Post-apartheid= Bizos became a member of the African National Congress' (ANC) Legal and Constitutional Committee in 1990, and at Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) he served as advisor to the negotiating teams and participated in drawing up the Interim Constitution. He was involved in the drafting of legislation, and particularly the Truth and Reconciliation Bill and amendments to the Criminal Procedures Act, to bring it into line with Chapter 3 of the constitution, guaranteeing fundamental human rights to all citizens of South Africa. Bizos was retained as counsel at various inquests into the deaths of people in detention. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, he was the leader of the team that opposed applications for amnesty on behalf of the Biko, Hani, Goniwe, Calata, Mkonto, Mhlauli, Slovo and Schoon families. Bizos was appointed by President Mandela to the Judicial Services Commission in 1994. It was responsible for recommending candidates for appointment as judges, as well as proposing post-apartheid reforms to the judicial system. Bizos was the leader of the team for the South African Government to argue that the death penalty was unconstitutional, and counsel for the National Assembly in the Certification of the Constitution by the Constitutional Court. He later served as a legal advisor to Mandela in 2005, during a bitter legal dispute with the latter's former lawyer, Ismail Ayob. He also represented the Chinese Association of South Africa in a case that ended in 2008 in which Chinese South Africans were granted 'previously disadvantaged' status, thus qualifying them for Black Economic Empowerment benefits. =Film about Rivonia= In 2017 Bizos appeared along with surviving defendants at the Rivonia Trial, Denis Goldberg, Andrew Mlangeni and Ahmed Kathrada, along with fellow defence lawyers Joel Joffe and Denis Kuny, in a documentary film entitled Life is Wonderful, directed by Sir Nicholas Stadlen, which tells the story of the trial. The title reflects Goldberg's words to his mother at the end of the trial on hearing that he and his comrades had been spared the death sentence. = Notable people represented = Bizos represented the following people, among others: * Nelson Mandela, since the 1950s * Trevor Huddleston of Sophiatown, 1950s * Mac Maharaj in the Little Rivonia Trial * Govan Mbeki in the Rivonia Trial in 1963‚Äì64 * Walter Sisulu in the Rivonia Trial in 1963‚Äì64, and afterwards his wife * Ahmed Timol's family, regarding his death in detention in 1971 * Steve Biko's family, regarding his death in detention in 1977 * Neil Aggett's family, regarding his death in detention in 1982 * Rob Adam in a trial for involvement in ANC activities, 1982Cape Times, 2 June 1982. * Patrick Lekota (known as \\"Terror\\") and Popo Molefe at the Delmas Treason Trial, 1985‚Äì89 * Chris Hani's family, during a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing where Hani's assassins had applied for amnesty. * Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change of Zimbabwe, when he was charged with planning a coup d'√©tat before the 2002 general elections * Winnie Madikizela-Mandela  Other activities  In the 1970s Bizos helped start a Greek school, called SAHETI. It embraced Hellenism, yet was non-exclusionist, even during the heart of apartheid. It was here that people like Chris Hani's children were educated.Vithoulkas, Jeana (7 March 2010), Two of Mandela's daughters brought court action in 2013 to oust Bizos, ex-Housing Minister Tokyo Sexwale and lawyer Bally Chuene as directors of two of Mandela's firms. Bizos said that the daughters were trying to \\"get their hands on things that should not be sold\\". The case was delayed after the daughters' lawyer Ismail Ayob withdrew from the case.  Personal life and death  Bizos was married to Arethe Daflos, known as \\"Rita\\", who he met in 1948 when she was an art student. The couple had three sons. Rita died in 2017, shortly before her husband's 90th birthday. Bizos died of natural causes at home on 9 September 2020 at the age of 92. He was given a special state funeral on 17 September 2020 and was buried at Westpark Cemetery next to his wife Rita.

Plastic shakedown behavior is one in which the steady state is a closed elastic-plastic loop, with no net accumulation of plastic deformation. Ratcheting behavior is one in which the steady state is an open elastic-plastic loop, with the material accumulating a net strain during each cycle. Shakedown concept can be applied to solid metallic materials under cyclic repeated loading or to granular materials under cyclic loading (such case can occur in road pavements under traffic loading). Ratcheting Check Not needed for only primary loading that meets static loading requirements. Needed for cyclic thermal loading plus primary loading with a mean. Shakedown of granular materials Shakedown cases in granular materials subjected to cyclic loading If repeated loading on the granular induces stress beyond the yield surface, three different cases may be observed. In case 1 the residual strain in the materials increases almost without limit. This so-called ‚Äúratcheting‚Äù state is close to what can be predicted applying simple Mohr‚ÄìCoulomb criterion to a cyclic loading. In the responses like case 2, residual strain in the materials grows to some extent, but at some stage the growth is stopped and further cyclic loading produces closed hysteresis loops of stress‚Äìstrain. Finally in case 3 the growth of residual strain is practically diminishes when sufficient loading cycles are applied. Case 2 and case 3 are cases of plastic and elastic shakedown respectively.

Background Turnour was the son of Edward Turnour, 5th Earl Winterton, and Lady Georgiana Susan Hamilton (1841‚Äì1913), daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn. Turnour was educated at Eton College.Hansard, Fifth Series, Volume 175, Col., 930, 25 March 1952 Political career Turnour was first elected for Horsham in a by- election in 1904 at the age of just 21, the youngest Member of Parliament (MP) in the Commons, and remained an MP for the next 47 years. In 1907 he succeeded his father, becoming 6th Earl Winterton. This was an Irish peerage and did not disqualify him from remaining a member of the House of Commons. Sitting as a Conservative, Winterton would slowly rise through the ranks, later achieving ministerial office as Under-Secretary of State for India in 1922, a post he held until 1924. In 1924 he was sworn of the Privy Council and once again served as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1924 to 1929. Winterton did not hold office in the National Governments headed by firstly Ramsay MacDonald and then Stanley Baldwin. However, when Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937, Winterton was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In March 1938 he was promoted to the Cabinet and given the job of speaking in the House of Commons of behalf of the Secretary of State for Air Viscount Swinton, a member of the House of Lords. In this role he proved a noted failure, especially in a heated debate in May 1938 which led to Chamberlain concluding that the Secretary of State for Air must be an MP. In July 1938 he led the British delegation to the Evian Conference at which the problem of the Jewish refugees was debated. Thereafter, Winterton was increasingly sidelined. The following year he was dropped from the Cabinet and served in the marginal post of Paymaster-General before leaving the government altogether. Winterton remained a Member of Parliament until 1951, by which time he was the MP with the longest continuous service. In 1952 he was created Baron Turnour, of Shillinglee in the County of Sussex, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Personal life In September 1910 the mother of Ivy Gordon-Lennox acted to contradict a rumour that her daughter was engaged to marry Winterton, going so far as to place a notice in The New York Times to say that there was no engagement.Ivy Gordon- Lennox Not Engaged dated 25 September 1910, at nytimes.com, accessed 24 July 2008 Winterton married the Honourable Cecilia Monica Wilson, daughter of Charles Wilson, 2nd Baron Nunburnholme, in 1924. The marriage was childless. Winterton died in August 1962, aged 79, when the barony of Turnour became extinct. He was succeeded in his Irish titles by his kinsman, Ronald Chard Turnour, 7th Earl Winterton.

Mintz, Book One (Silk Pagoda, 2006), 66. ‚Äì660) was the 31st and final ruler of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. His reign ended when Baekje was conquered by an alliance of the rival Korean kingdom Silla and China's Tang dynasty.  Background  During this time, the northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, under the control of Yeon Gaesomun, took aggressive stances against Silla and the Tang. Silla responded by eventually allying closely with Tang China, threatening Baekje in the middle. According to the Samguk Sagi, Uija was the eldest son of King Mu. According to a legend in the Samguk Yusa, Mu was a Baekje peasant who married Princess Seonhwa of Silla (making her Uija's mother), but this is not considered orthodox history. Uija was made crown prince in January 632 and became king upon his father's death in 641.  Reign  Although friendly with Tang China at first, Uija soon allied with Goguryeo to attack Silla. In 642, he led a campaign against Silla and conquered some 40 castles. He also sent a force of 10,000 to take Silla's Daeya Fortress and kill Kim Chunchu's daughter and son-in-law. The next year, with Goguryeo, Baekje attacked Silla again and tried to block its diplomatic route to Tang China. When Silla-Tang forces attacked Goguryeo in 645, he attacked Silla and took seven castles. Baekje and Goguryeo hit Silla's northern border in 655. Soon upon becoming king, Uija undertook political reform to control the powers of the aristocracy. However, his reign was plagued by the internal power struggle among the nobles and corruption and decadence within the court. As the court fell into disarray, the Silla-Tang alliance, repeatedly frustrated by Goguryeo's Yeon Gaesomun, changed strategy and decided to attack Goguryeo's ally Baekje first.  Fall of Baekje  In 660, Baekje's navy was defeated by Tang's navy, and Silla's army led by Kim Yu-sin defeated Baekje's army led by Gye Baek. Sabi, Baekje's capital, (in present-day Buyeo, Chungcheongnam-do) was surrounded by the Silla-Tang allied forces. Uija and the crown prince escaped to Ungjin (in present-day Gongju), but surrendered when Sabi fell. He was taken to Tang along with his sons Buyeo Hyo and Buyeo Yung, 88 retainers, and 12,807 Baekje peasants. Another of his sons, Buyeo Pung, later attempted to restore his father's kingdom. In 2000, his remains were retrieved from China and buried in a new tomb in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea, near what was Baekje's final capital, Sabi. Uija was his personal name; he did not receive a posthumous name.

Established in 1974 and wholly owned by the Government of Malaysia, the corporation is vested with the entire oil and gas resources in Malaysia and is entrusted with the responsibility of developing and adding value to these resources. Petronas is ranked among Fortune Global 500's largest corporations in the world. Fortune ranks Petronas as the 158th largest company in the world in 2019. Since its incorporation, Petronas has grown to be an integrated international oil and gas company with business interests in 35 countries. As of the end of March 2005, the Group comprised 103 wholly owned subsidiaries, 19 partly owned outfits and 57 associated companies. Together, these companies make the company, which is involved in various oil and gas-based activities. The Financial Times has identified Petronas as one of the \\"new seven sisters\\":The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals, by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007 the most influential and mainly state-owned national oil and gas companies from countries outside the OECD. The group is engaged in a broad spectrum of petroleum activities, including upstream exploration and production of oil and gas to downstream oil refining; marketing and distribution of petroleum products; trading; gas processing and liquefaction; gas transmission pipeline network operations; marketing of liquefied natural gas; petrochemical manufacturing and marketing; shipping; automotive engineering; and property investment. Petronas provides a substantial source of income for the Malaysian government, with half of the government's budget dependent on the company's dividend, moreover in 2011 actual government balance has 5 percent deficit of Gross Domestic Product. The company is headquartered at the Petronas Towers which was officially opened on Malaysia's 42nd National Day, 1999 ‚Äì in the corporation's 24th Anniversary year. History Before the formation of Malaysia, Royal Dutch Shell first began the oil exploration in Miri, Sarawak; after Charles Brooke signed the first Oil Mining Lease in 1909. In 1910, the first oil well was drilled in Miri. This oil well is later known as the Grand Old Lady. In 1929, oil was discovered in Brunei. There were no other drilling activities in Borneo or British Malaya until 1950s. In 1966, the enactment of Petroleum Mining Act gave Exxon and Shell rights to explore oil territories and produce oil royalties and tax payments to the government. In the late 1960s, Esso and Continental Oil were given concessions to explore oil off the shores of the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. By 1974, Malaysia's output of crude oil stood at about to . =Setting up a state oil and gas company: 1970s= Several factors converged in the early 1970s to prompt the Malaysian government into setting up a state oil and gas company. In 1972, the oil price per barrel was US$1.50, which later rose to US$2.28 per barrel. War in the middle east and oil embargo by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had caused the price per barrel to rise until US$12.00, thus giving more incentives for Malaysia to set up her own oil company. Several countries such as United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Indonesia have adopted the production sharing agreement instead of a concession system for oil revenue distribution. The Malaysian government also believed that foreign oil companies did not properly inform the government regarding the oil exploration activities in their own concessions (such as the new discovery of oil fields), thus resulted in a loss of revenue to the government. The formulation of Malaysian New Economic Policy in the early 1970s encourages Malaysians to take control of various modern industries and to open more economic opportunities for bumiputera (Malaysian natives). The former chief minister of Sarawak, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub was one of the first who proposed the idea of Malaysia setting up an oil company in 1971. It was due to the pressure of the Sarawak people who sought to clarify the exact boundaries of Sarawak territorial waters. In fact, since the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the issue of territorial waters of Sabah and Sarawak has not been fully addressed, thus leaving its interpretation wide open. The Sarawak government has declared that the territorial waters extend well beyond the three-mile limit defined by the Malaysian federal government. However, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub was reminded of Tun Abdul Razak's act of installing him as the chief minister of Sarawak. Therefore, Rahman decided to keep the conflict as low profile as possible. Rahman's nephew, Abdul Taib Mahmud assumed the role of federal land and mines minister after Rahman became the chief minister of Sarawak. Taib believed in the sharing of oil royalties between the state and the federal government. During the time, the oil mining activities in Sarawak were still under the exclusive control of Shell. Taib Mahmud initially suggested allowing independent contractors to market government oil. Taib found a Lebanese trader to purchase the Malaysian oil, however, the contractor defaulted on payments, resulting in US$4 million loss. A government hydrocarbon committee was later set up. Taib Mahmud visited Indonesia and had a discussion with Pertamina (Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company). Taib suggested that Malaysia to scrap the concession system and replace it with production sharing agreement. However, there were no laws that allow Malaysia to take back the concessions without paying compensations to foreign oil companies. Despite this, Taib decided to set up a statutory body named \\"HIKMA\\" (Hidrokarbon Malaysia), which would have total rights of oil found in the territorial waters of Sabah and Sarawak. However, Rahman Ya'kub protested his nephew decision and threatened the federal government to court if Sarawak were to left out of this oil deal. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah (chairman of Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (Pernas)) visited Rahman at the latter private residence. Tengku Razaleigh suggested the formation of a company instead of a statutory body where the former would distribute profits equally between the federal and the state governments. Rahman agreed with the suggestion. Tengku Razaleigh drafted the Petroleum Development Act together with his associates in secret, as instructed by Tun Razak, and to be completed before the 1974 Malaysian general election. Rahman Ya'kub then telephoned Tengku Razaleigh to ask about the terms offered by the Malaysian federal government. Tengku Razaleigh then told Rahman regarding abolishment of the concession system. Meanwhile, 5% oil royalty will be given to the respective oil-producing states. Rahman agreed with the deal. In 1974, the Petroleum Development Act was tabled in parliament and approved. Petronas was incorporated on 17 August 1974, and Tengku Razaleigh became its inaugural chairman. Initially, Exxon and Shell refused to surrender their concessions and refused to negotiate with Petronas. Petronas then served a notice to all foreign oil companies that after 1 April 1975, all the foreign oil companies would be operating illegally in Malaysian waters if they do not start negotiations with Petronas. After a few rounds of negotiations, foreign oil companies finally surrendered their concessions to Petronas. While all other oil-producing states in Malaysia signed the petroleum agreement, Tun Mustapha, the chief minister of Sabah, stubbornly refused to sign the oil agreement, complaining of the meagre 5% oil royalty. Mustapha requested for 10 to 20% oil royalty, otherwise, he would threaten to pull Sabah out of Malaysia. Tengku Razaleigh refused to bulge in. The Malaysian federal government then make another deal with Datuk Harris Salleh (who was out of favour with Tun Mustapha) to establish BERJAYA party and oust Tun Mustapha out of power. However, Harris was reluctant to become the Chief Minister of Sabah, and Fuad Stephens was asked to assume to chief minister post if BERJAYA were to come to power. BERJAYA successfully ousted Tun Mustapha in 1976 Sabah state election. One week after the 1976 air crash which killed the chief minister Fuad Stephens and other five state ministers, Harris signed the oil agreement. With Sabah entering the oil agreement, Petronas finally has total control of all oil and gas reserves in Malaysia. Petronas first embarked on the oil exploration and production activities with the formation of Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd in 1978. In 1980, Petronas expanded its downstream businesses by setting up ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser plant in Sarawak. =Battling oil depletion: the late 1980s= Oil exploration was by no means at an end and could yet produce more reserves. The Seligi field, which came onstream at the end of 1988 and was developed by Esso Production Malaysia, was one of the richest oilfields so far found in Malaysia waters, and further concessions to the majors would encourage exploration of the deeper waters around Malaysia, where unknown reserves could be discovered. Meanwhile, computerised seismography made it both feasible and commercially justifiable to re-explore fields which had been abandoned, or were assumed to be unproductive, over the past century. In 1990, Petronas invited foreign companies to re-explore parts of the sea off Sabah and Sarawak on the basis of new surveys using up-to-date techniques. Another way to postpone depletion was to develop sources of oil, and of its substitute, natural gas, outside Malaysia. Late in 1989, the governments of Vietnam and Myanmar (Burma) invited Petronas Carigali to take part in joint ventures to explore for oil in their coastal waters. In 1990, a new unit, Petronas Carigali Overseas Sdn Bhd, was created to take up a 15% interest in a field in Myanmar's waters being explored by Idemitsu Myanmar Oil Exploration Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Japanese firm Idemitsu Oil Development Co. Ltd., in a production sharing arrangement with Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. Thus began Petronas' first oil exploration outside Malaysia. In May 1990, the governments of Malaysia and Thailand settled a long-running dispute over their respective rights to an area of 7,300 square kilometres in the Gulf of Thailand by setting up a joint administrative authority for the area and encouraging a joint oil exploration project by Petronas, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, and the US company Triton Oil. In a separate deal, in October 1990, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand arranged with Petronas to study the feasibility of transferring natural gas from this jointly administered area, through Malaysia to Thailand, by way of an extension of the pipelines laid for the third stage of the Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project. That project was on course to becoming a major element in the postponement of oil depletion. Contracts for line pipes for the second stage of the project were signed in 1989 with two consortia of Malaysian, Japanese, and Brazilian companies. This stage, completed in 1991, included the laying of 730 kilometres of pipeline through to the tip of the Peninsula, from where gas could be sold to Singapore and Thailand; the conversion of two power stations‚ÄîPort Dickson and Pasir Gudang‚Äîfrom oil to gas; and the expansion of Petronas' output of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), propylene, and polypropylene, which were already being produced in joint ventures with Idemitsu Petrochemical Co. of Japan and Neste Oy of Finland. The third and final stage of the project was to lay pipelines along the northwest and northeast coastlines of the Peninsula and was completed in 1997. Another new venture in 1990 was in ship-owning, since Petronas' existing arrangements with MISC and with Nigeria's state oil company would be inadequate to transport the additional exports of LNG due to start in 1994, under the contract with Saibu Gas. Petronas did not lose sight of the government's commitment to Malaysian self-reliance, and the company's second refinery at Malacca, completed in 1994, with a capacity of , promoted the same policy. The fact that it was built in a joint venture with Samsung of Korea, the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan, and Caltex of the United States did not negate the policy, for the subsidiary company Petronas Penapisan (Melaka) had a decisive 45% of equity while sharing the enormous costs of and gaining advanced technology for the project. More to the point, a side effect of the refinery's completion was that Petronas was able to refine all of the crude oil it produced, instead of being partially dependent on refining facilities in Singapore. Petronas, with its policies of promoting self-reliance, helping to develop associated industries, and varying the sources and uses of oil and gas, played an important role in the Malaysian economy as a whole. Under governments which‚Äîby current, if not historical, Western standards‚Äîwere strongly interventionist, the contribution of oil taxes to the federal government's revenue hovered at around 12% to 16% until 1980, when it showed a marked increase to 23%, followed by another leap to 32% in 1981. From then until 1988 the proportion fluctuated between 29% and 36%. Petronas was not just another big oil company: it controlled a crucial sector of the economy and remained, for better or worse, an indispensable instrument of the state. =Expanding globally: the 1990s and beyond= The Petronas Twin Towers A Petronas station seen in Pattaya, Thailand During the mid- to late 1990s, international exploration, development, and production remained key components in Petronas' strategy along with diversification. A key discovery was made in the Ruby field in Vietnam in 1994. That year, the firm also saw its first overseas production from the Dai Hung field in Vietnam and established its first retail station outside of Malaysia in Cambodia. In 1995, a subsidiary was created to import, store, and distribute liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In addition, the company's polyethylene plant in Kerteh began operations. Petronas marked a significant milestone during this time period‚Äîtwo of its subsidiaries, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd, went public on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Between 1993 and 1996, it purchased the former sub-Saharaian branch of Mobil Oil, rebranded as Engen Petroleum. In 1996, Petronas entered the aromatics market by way of a joint venture that created Aromatics Malaysia Sdn Bhd. It also formed a contract with China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Chevron Overseas Petroleum Ltd. to begin the exploration of block 02/31 of the Liaodong Bay area in China. While the Asian economy as a whole suffered from an economic crisis during 1997 and 1998, Malaysia was quick to bounce back due to successful government reforms. From its new headquarters in the Petronas Twin Towers, the state-owned concern continued its development in the oil and gas industry. During 1997, Petronas heightened its diversification efforts. The firm set plans in motion to build three petrochemical plants in Kuantan as well as an acetic facility in Kerteh. Its first LPG joint venture in China was launched that year, and the company acquired a 29.3% interest in Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad (MISC). In 1998, Petronas' tanker-related subsidiary merged with MISC, increasing Petronas' stake in MISC to 62%. That year, Petronas introduced the Petronas E01, the country's first commercial prototype engine. The company also signed a total of five new production sharing contracts (PSCs) in 1998 and 1999, and began oil production in the Sirri field in Iran. Petronas entered the new century determined to expand its international efforts. The company forged deals for two new exploration plots in Pakistan and began construction on the Chad-Cameroon Integrated Oil Development and Pipeline Project. By 2002, Petronas had signed seven new PSCs and secured stakes in eight exploration blocks in eight countries, including Gabon, Cameroon, Niger, Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The firm also made considerable progress in its petrochemicals strategy, opening new gas-based petrochemical facilities in Kerteh and Gebeng. By 2003, Malaysia was set to usurp Algeria as the world's second-largest producer of LNG with the completion of the Malaysia LNG Tiga Plant. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad commented on the achievement in a May 2003 Bernama News Agency article, claiming that \\"the Petronas LNG complex now serves as another shining example of a vision realized of a national aspiration, transformed into reality by the same belief among Malaysians that 'we can do it.'\\" Indeed, Petronas had transformed itself into a global oil company over the previous decade, becoming a national symbol for success. The company realised, however, that it would have to continue its aggressive growth strategy to ensure its survival in the years to come. The Petronas overseas expansion drive continues with the acquisition of Woodside Energy Ltd Mauritania assets for $418 million in 2007. The venture proved successful as they discovered oil in May 2008 In 2004, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Datuk Mustapa Mohamed, stated that Petronas contributed RM 25 Billion to the country's treasury accounting for 25% of revenue collected via dividends and other revenues. Petronas continuously provides the Malaysian government dividends from its profits. Since its inception in 1974, Petronas have paid the government RM 403.3 billion, with RM 67.6 billion in 2008. The payment represents 44% of the 2008 federal government revenue. Petronas continued to focus on international exploration projects as 40% of revenue in 2008 was derived from international projects such as Iran, Sudan, Chad and Mauritania. The company's international reserves stood at 6.24 billion barrels oil equivalent in 2008. On 9 April, 2019, Petronas was praised for its role in the Sudanese oil and gas industry by Minister of Oil and Gas engineer Yagoub Adam Bashir Gamaa. On 29 October 2012, Petronas sources said it would renew a bid for gas producer Progress Energy Resources after Canada blocked its bid earlier that month. The $6-billion bid was approved by Ottawa on 7 December 2012. On 17 January 2013, Petronas issued a statement that an onshore oil and gas discovery has been made in the state after drilling a test well about 20 kilometres away from the city of Miri in northern Sarawak. The well was found to have a net hydrocarbon thickness of 349 meters. It had flow rates of 440 barrels of crude oil per day and 11.5 million standard cubic feet of gas per day. The find is the first onshore oil discovery in Malaysia in 24 years. On 2 May 2015, Petronas completed its acquisition of oil and gas assets in Azerbaijan from Norway's Statoil (now Equinor) for US$2.25 billion. Plagued by the 2010s oil glut, Petronas reported on 26 February 2015 that it cut its 2015 capital expenditures budget after reporting a $2 billion fourth quarter loss, the company's first loss since it began reporting quarterly results five years ago. On 1 April 2017, Petronas' PFLNG Satu, is the world's first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, has achieved a new milestone with the successful loading of its first cargo at the Kanowit gas field, offshore Bintulu, Sarawak. On 25 July, 2017, Petronas cancelled a $36-billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, the Pacific Northwest LNG, which was considered ambitious and a priority in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Both the company and the province blamed poor global LNG market conditions. =War crimes in Sudan= In June 2010, the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) published the report \\"Unpaid Debt\\", that called upon the governments of Sweden, Austria, and Malaysia to look into allegations that Petronas, Lundin Petroleum, and OMV may have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity whilst operating in Block 5A, South Sudan (then Sudan), during the period 1997‚Äì2003. The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement. When the consortium that Petronas took part in operated in Block 5A, approximately 12,000 people died, and 160,000 were violently displaced from their land and homes, many forever. Satellite pictures taken between 1994 and 2003 show that the activities of Petronas in Sudan coincided with a spectacular drop in agricultural land use in its concession area. In June 2010, the Swedish public prosecutor for international crimes opened a criminal investigation into links between Sweden and the reported crimes. In 2016, Lundin Petroleum's Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter were informed that they were the suspects of the investigation. Sweden's Government gave the green light for the Public Prosecutor in October 2018 to indict the two top executives On 1 November 2018, and the Swedish Prosecution Authority notified Lundin Petroleum AB that the company might be liable to a corporate fine and forfeiture of economic benefits of SEK 3,285 million (app. ‚Ç¨315 million) for involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Consequently, the company itself will also be charged, albeit indirectly, and will be legally represented in court. On 15 November 2018, the suspects were served with the draft charges and the case files. They will be indicted for aiding and abetting international crimes and may face life imprisonment if found guilty. The trial is likely to begin in the Autumn of 2020 and may take two years. The Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon Petronas and its shareholders to pay off their debt to them. A conviction in Sweden may provide some level of remedy and reparation for the few victims of human rights violations who will testify in court, but not for the other 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. The Swedish court cannot impose obligations upon Petronas. On 23 May 2019, the T.M.C. Asser Institute for International Law in The Hague organized the conference 'Towards criminal liability of corporations for human rights violations: The Lundin case in Sweden'. The international standard for business and human rights, the UNGP, underlines the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of the adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to. The company has never publicly showed an interest in the adverse effects of its activities on the communities in its concession area. According to the Dutch peace organisation PAX, Petronas, Lundin Petroleum, OMV, as well as their shareholders are disregarding the human rights standards that they claim to respect, because they, A. never conducted appropriate due diligence for their Sudanese operations; B. made no effort to know their human rights impacts; and C. do not show how they address alleged adverse human rights impacts. Petronas Carigali Overseas Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petronas Group of Companies, held a 28.5% share in the consortium that acquired the right to explore and develop oil deposits in Block 5A. In 2003, Lundin Petroleum and OMV sold their interest following a public outcry about the role of the consortium in Sudan's oil war. Petronas picked up Lundin's 40.375% working interest for a cash payment of US$142.5 million. As the operator of the consortium, Lundin Petroleum was responsible for day-to-day management. Still, it stood under the supervision of the Operating Committee, that exercised \\"overall direction and control of all matters pertaining to the Joint Operations and the Joint Property\\". Petronas was permanently represented in the Operating Committee and has never publicly distanced itself from any of its decisions.Joint Operating Agreement between IPC Sudan Limited and Petronas Carigali Overseasn Sdn Bhd and OMV (SUDAN) Exploration GmbH and Sudapet Ltd. SUDAN BLOCK 5A, 7 April 1999. Petronas has never publicly responded to the allegations of negative impacts in Sudan or discussed the issue with local communities. The company is not known to have taken adequate measures to prevent involvement in human rights violations during the oil war or to undo the adverse impacts of its consortium's operations. Petronas was a loyal participant in the consortium that operated in Block 5A and had a substantial say in the way it operated. Therefore, the suspicions against the consortium's top managers also concern Petronas. The company is wholly owned by the Malaysian State. According to the UN Guiding Principles, abuse of human rights by a business enterprise that is wholly or partially controlled by a State, may entail a violation of that State's own international law obligations.UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, p. 7. Corporate logo File:Petronas 2013 logo.svgPetronas Logo 2013 - present File:Petronas Logo.svgPetronas Logo 1990‚Äì2013 Petronas' logo was created in 1974 by Dato Johan Ariff of Johan Design Associates. He is also responsible in creating the Logo of many Petronas subsidiaries, JVs, link-companies and properties, including Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC), MISC, MMHE, Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP), Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, Putrajaya Holdings, Prince Court Medical Centre (PCMC), PETLIN, Malaysian Petroleum Club and Mesra Mall, to name a few. =Logo concept= The basic structure is geometric, embodying metaphoric and alpha glyphic nuances of an oil drop and a typography 'P', the latter being evident in the triangle assigned at the top right corner. The triangle is also an essential element to define directional movement and dynamic. The placement of a solid circle in the Logo is interpretive of the wheel in the oil and gas industry while the outline of the drop simulates a driving system, the energy which is derived from petroleum. The corporate colour chosen for the logo is emerald green, referencing the sea where oil and gas is procured. =Refreshed logo= In 2013, Petronas introduced a refreshed version of its corporate logo\\"Petronas unveils refreshed version of logo\\". Business Times. 11 June 2013. at the 2013 Asia Oil and Gas Conference (AOGC 2013). A renewed \\"look and feel\\" has been incorporated to the original Petronas' oil drop logo to reflect the visual expression of Petronas' Group Positioning, reimagining energy‚Ñ¢. The refreshed logo was part of a group-wide exercise to further strengthen the visual potential of Petronas' corporate icon by making it more contemporary while building on the existing equity and legacy of the Petronas brand. In essence, the refreshed logo symbolises the growth and progression of the Petronas brand. Petronas was established during the oil and gas crisis in the early 1970s. Over the years it has focused on building its business and operational capabilities and continues to seek more efficient and better methods of managing and adding value to Malaysia's oil and gas resources and meet increasing energy demands. This challenging spirit has propelled Petronas from being a manager of Malaysia's hydrocarbon resources to become a fully integrated oil and gas multinational. The organisation was among the earliest national oil companies (NOC) to venture globally which has inspired many other NOCs to join the global oil and gas arena, changing the dynamics of today's oil and gas industry. Petronas will continue to play an active role in oil and gas by focusing on collective efforts to do things differently by challenging industry norms to achieve real, sustainable long-term growth. Throughout its journey, Petronas has ensured that people benefit from its activities through business and employment opportunities, education sponsorship and quality products and services. The refreshed version is Petronas' third-generation logo. The original Petronas logo was developed in 1974 when Petronas was first incorporated. The basic structure comprises an oil drop feature and symbol \\"P‚Äù that conveys its core business in oil and gas, and dynamism of the company. At the centre of the oil drop is a solid circle that symbolises the complete cycle or value chain of the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the familiar Petronas emerald green represents the seas and land where oil and gas originates. The refreshed logo's softer curves have been added to the oil drop which depicts a continuous flow that symbolises Petronas' drive for progress and challenging spirit in meeting the energy demands and expectations of its stakeholders. The Petronas name has been repositioned below the oil drop and the font has been sharpened to enhance visibility and give prominence to the oil drop in the logo. Subsidiaries Petronas has more than 100 subsidiaries and around 40 Joint Venture companies in which Petronas has at least 50% stake in the company. Although Petronas is considering to listing more of its subsidiaries, so far the company has listed at least 3 of its subsidiaries in the Bursa Malaysia. =Petronas Dagangan Berhad= thumb350pxright A Petronas petrol station at km 54, Karak-Kuala Lumpur Highway Involved in the distribution and sale of finished petroleum products and operations of service stations for the domestic market.

They are also recommended fuel and lubricants for Yamaha motorcycles. Motorsport Petronas sponsored the Formula One left Petronas supported TOM'S, a Toyota automobile racing squad in Super GT between 2008 and 2015 Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One racing team since 2010. (pictured here in 2017) Petronas was one of the main sponsors of the BMW Sauber Formula One team alongside Intel, and it supplies lubricants and fuel to the team. It also owned 40% of Sauber Petronas Engineering, the company that builds chassis which formerly used Ferrari designed engines used by the Sauber team, until being bought out by German motor company BMW. Petronas was also the main sponsor for Malaysian Grand Prix, and co-sponsored the Chinese Grand Prix, and the inaugural Korean Grand Prix . Petronas was the exclusive premium partner of the Sauber Petronas (1995‚Äì2005) and BMW Sauber F1 Team (2006‚Äì2009). BMW had acquired the controlling stake of the former Sauber Petronas Engineering, but left the sport after the 2009 season. On 21 December 2009, Petronas was confirmed as moving from BMW Sauber to the newly formed Mercedes AMG Petronas Motorsport team.http://www.brawngp.com/readstory.asp?bgp=j%C1%AA%C0rZ%7Df In terms of further Formula One involvement, every year Petronas took the BMW Sauber team to various parts of Malaysia for F1 demos, so the public who are unable to go to the track itself get to experience a little bit of what F1 offers. Other promotional events are held in the run up to the race and the drivers play an integral part in this so much so that Nick Heidfeld conceded that there were more fans for BMW Sauber in Malaysia than in most other countries. As part of its corporate social responsibility programme, Petronas also brings underprivileged children to watch the race. Petronas also sponsors the Malaysian Cub Prix races. It also sponsors many other sporting events and teams, mostly motorsports. Some of these sponsorships include the PERT (Petronas EON Rally Team), the now-defunct Foggy Petronas Superbike team (in which Petronas debuts their superbike, the FP1), and also the Petronas Adventure Team, a 4X4 adventure team.

Education Petronas University of Technologyleft Petronas awards education sponsorships in the form of convertible loans to Malaysian and international students to further their studies at local or foreign universities. The Petronas unit that is responsible for handling education matters is called the Sponsorship & Talent Sourcing Unit (STS). These sponsorships are awarded based on academic results, co-curricular activities, family background as well as an assessment of student personality (which is conducted throughout a program called EduCamp, which all prospective Petronas students are required to undergo). Students who are absorbed by Petronas at the end of their tertiary studies have their convertible loans converted into full scholarships. These students are under contractual agreement to work for the company for two years, for every one year they are sponsored. Petronas has its own research university, Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP). Built in 1997, the campus is located in Seri Iskandar, Perak.

He was an independent member of the Victorian Legislative Council representing Silvan Province from November 2005 to November 2006, after being expelled from the parliamentary Liberal Party, which he had represented since 1999. His career has been dogged by controversy after a 2004 drink-driving incident, which ultimately saw him lose Liberal Party pre-selection to contest his seat at the 2006 state election. He was subsequently expelled from the parliamentary party and forced to sit as an independent after criticising the party's pre-selection decision, and accusing the party of being homophobic.  Early career  Olexander, who is openly gay, was born in the regional city of Geelong, though he attended high school in suburban Melbourne. He studied economics at the University of Melbourne before pursuing a career in market research. He became heavily involved with the Young Liberal movement, acting as its State President from 1989 to 1990. He also served on its Federal Policy Committee, as well as the broader party's Federal Council during the same period. In the late 1980s Olexander, who was of Hungarian and Ukrainian descent,Victorian Parliamentary Hansard for Tuesday, 3 May 2005 helped form the Australian Chernobyl Children's Relief Foundation which provided financial and medical help to victims of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. He became the honorary inaugural secretary of that foundation in 1990. In 1999, Olexander won pre-selection for the safe Liberal Legislative Council seat of Silvan Province, and was subsequently elected. After the Liberal Party's crushing defeat at the 2002 election, Olexander was promoted to the shadow ministry, taking on the portfolios of Youth, Arts and Consumer Affairs in December 2002. During 2002 to 2004, he also served on the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee.  Controversies  In the early hours of 11 July 2004, Olexander had been drinking and was driving home when he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed his taxpayer funded car into four parked cars in Port Melbourne. He was fined $500 and lost his licence for 12 months. He attracted some attention in late 2004 for advocating for greater funding for gambling support groups and his criticism of the government's backdown on their election promise to extend the Epping railway line to South Morang. On 7 January 2009, Olexander appeared before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, accused of driving on the CityLink tollway three times without a pass. Magistrate Sharon Cure ordered Olexander pay a $100 fine on each of the three counts of using an unregistered vehicle on a tollway plus $40 in court costs.  Party expulsion  Olexander kept a relatively low profile throughout the remainder of 2005, and despite past controversy, attempted to retain Liberal preselection to contest his seat at the 2006 state election. He received some initial support when Opposition Leader Robert Doyle backed his bid to remain in parliament, but failed to reach double figures in a ballot of the 150 preselection delegates; not enough to even gain him the bottom position on the ticket. In mid-November 2005 Liberal state leader Robert Doyle convened a meeting of the Parliamentary Liberal Party and asked Olexander to show cause why he should not be expelled from the Parliamentary Party for \\"bringing the Party into disrepute\\". Subsequently, Doyle convened a second meeting of the PLP on 29 November and moved that Olexander be expelled. This motion was carried (votes not released). Olexander served out the remainder of his term in the Upper House sitting on the cross benches. Olexander commented that he \\"would continue working as the member for the outer-suburban seat of Silvan and would sit on Parliament's cross-benches as an independent\\".  Independent Member  Since his expulsion from the Parliamentary Liberal Party Olexander has made several statements alleging that he was expelled because of anti-gay sentiment among Liberal parliamentarians, naming Philip Davis, Bill Forwood, Bruce Atkinson and Gordon Rich-Phillips. All four have strongly denied these allegations. In June 2006, Olexander was reported to have drafted a Private Member's Bill that would allow gay civil unions in Victoria. The bill is unlikely to pass, let alone be debated due to Labor control of both Houses of Parliament. Despite threatening to run against Liberal members in the reformed Upper House, Olexander failed to nominate for the 2006 State Election. He retired from Parliament on 25 November 2006, the day of the poll.

It was released in October 1967 by Verve Records and was recorded following Nico's collaboration with the Velvet Underground on their 1967 debut. It was produced by Tom Wilson, who added string and flute arrangements against the wishes of Nico. The title is a reference to Andy Warhol's 1966 film Chelsea Girls, in which Nico starred. Much of the album features instrumental work and songwriting credits from Velvet Underground members Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison, and John Cale. The song \\"I'll Keep It with Mine\\" was written by Bob Dylan, while three songs are by Jackson Browne, who contributes guitar.  Background  After collaborating as a singer with the Velvet Underground on their debut The Velvet Underground & Nico (recorded during 1966, released in March 1967), Warhol superstar Nico toured with the band in Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable (EPI) multimedia roadshow. Before the EPI came to an end in 1967, Nico took up residence in a New York City coffeehouse as a solo folk chanteuse; accompanied in turn by guitarists, such as Tim Hardin, Jackson Browne, and also her Velvet Underground bandmates Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison and John Cale.  Composition  Some of the accompanists wrote songs for Nico to sing, and these form the backbone of Chelsea Girl. Browne and Hardin contributed some songs, \\"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\\" by Lou Reed was part of the earliest Velvet Underground repertoire (which did not surface as a Velvet Underground recording until it was included in the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See), and Reed, Cale and Morrison in various combinations contributed four more songs. Additionally, Bob Dylan gave her one of his songs to record: \\"I'll Keep It with Mine\\". Musically, Chelsea Girl can be described as a cross between chamber folk and 1960s pop. The musical backing is relatively simple, consisting of one or two guitars or, alternatively, a keyboard instrument, played by either Browne or (a combination of) her Velvet Underground colleagues, but there are no drums or bass instruments, hence the absence of Velvets drummer Maureen Tucker, and adding to the chamber folk feel of the music are the string and flute overdubs added to the initial recordings by producer Tom Wilson and arranger Larry Fallon without involving or consulting Nico.  Reception  In retrospective 21st-century reviews AllMusic feel the album is \\"an unqualified masterpiece\\", while Trouser Press feel that the album \\"is sabotaged by tepid arrangements and weak production\\" and is \\"of interest mainly for its links to the band Nico had just left.\\" Nico was dissatisfied with the finished product. Looking back in 1981, she stated:  Legacy  Two tracks from the album ‚Äì \\"The Fairest of the Seasons\\" and \\"These Days\\" ‚Äì were used in Wes Anderson's 2001 film, The Royal Tenenbaums. \\"The Fairest of the Seasons\\" was also used in Gus Van Sant's 2011 film Restless. \\"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\\" is used in Andrew Dominik's 2012 film Killing Them Softly.

Robert Darwin died in the house on 13 November 1848, followed by his unmarried daughters Catherine and Susan. Since there were no surviving members of the Darwin family in residence, the house was then put up for auction, after the three surviving Darwin children, Ras, Charles, and Caroline Wedgwood had taken what possessions they wished. , the house is occupied by the District Valuer and Valuation Office of Shrewsbury, and visits may be made by appointment during office hours. The building is grade II* listed. The site is not recognized as a museum. However, Down House, where Darwin spent most of his adult life, is a museum. In January 2018 a steering group was established by the Mayor of Shrewsbury, Councillor Jane Mackenzie, and led by Shrewsbury Town Council. Their purpose was to acquire Mount House and take it into public ownership, so that a visitor destination could be developed where Darwin's contribution to science could be celebrated.

She was the first woman elected to the executive committee of the African National Congress, and helped launch the Federation of South African Women. Prior to becoming a machinist at a textile mill, where she was employed from 1945 to 1956, Ngoyi enrolled to become a nurse.  Political activism  She joined the ANC Women's League in 1952; she was at that stage a widow with two children and an elderly mother to support, and worked as a seamstress. A year later she was elected as President of the Women's League. On 9 August 1956, Ngoyi led a women's march along with Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa, Sophia De Bruyn, Motlalepula Chabaku, Bertha Gxowa and Albertina Sisulu of 20,000 women to the Union Buildings of Pretoria in protest against the apartheid government requiring women to carry passbooks as part of the pass laws. Lilian Ngoyi was also a transnational figure who recognised the potential influence that international support could have on the struggle against apartheid and the emancipation of black women. With this in mind she embarked on an audacious (and highly illegal) journey to Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1955 to participate in the World Congress of Mothers held by the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). Accompanied by her fellow activist Dora Tamana, and as an official delegate of FEDSAW, she embarked on a journey that would see an attempt to stow away on a boat leaving Cape Town under \\"white names\\", defy (with the help of a sympathetic pilot) segregated seating on a plane bound for London and gain entry to Britain under the pretext of completing her course in Bible studies. She would visit England, Germany, Switzerland, Romania, China and Russia, meeting women leaders often engaged in left-wing politics, before arriving back in South Africa a wanted woman. Ngoyi was known as a strong orator and a fiery inspiration to many of her colleagues in the ANC. She was arrested in 1956, spent 71 days in solitary confinement, and was for a period of 15 years placed under severe bans and restrictions that confined her to her home in Orlando, Soweto. Memorials and honours The Koos Beukes Clinic at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto has been renamed Lilian Ngoyi Community Clinic in her honour. On 16 November 2004, the South African Ministry of the Environment launched the lead ship in a class of environmental patrol vessels named in her honour. On 9 August 2006, the 50th anniversary of the march on Pretoria, Strijdom Square from which the women marched was renamed Lilian Ngoyi Square. 9 August is commemorated in South Africa as Women's Day. In 2009, a residence hall at Rhodes University was renamed in her honour. In 2012, Van der Walt Street in Pretoria was renamed Lilian Ngoyi Street. Other roads in Cape Town, Thembisa, Berea, Durban, and Hartbeesfontein have been named in her honour. The City of Johannesburg decided to honor Mme Lilian Masediba Ngoyi by renaming the Bree Street in Johannesburg after her in 2014 ‚Äì the street named Lilian Ngoyi Street.

In the September 2017 FIDE list, he has an Elo rating of 2637. Career Azmaiparashvili became a Grandmaster in 1988. Among his achievements are a 2810 performance rating at the 1998 Chess Olympiad and first-place finishes at Pavlodar 1982, Moscow 1986, Albena 1986, Tbilisi 1986, London (Lloyds Bank Open) 1989, and in the 2003 European Individual Chess Championship in Silivri. In 2010 he tied for 1st‚Äì2nd with IM Oliver Barbosa in the 1st ASEAN Chess Championship in Singapore, and won the event on tie-break. Azmaiparashvili is active in chess politics. He is a board member of the European Chess Union and a vice-president of international chess federation FIDE. In August 2009, he was appointed as captain of Azerbaijani chess team and won European Team Chess Championship in Novi Sad (Serbia). Controversies In winning the 2003 European Championship in Istanbul, Azmaiparashvili retracted a move against Vladimir Malakhov (who subsequently finished second). By retracting his blunder and playing a sensible move, Azmaiparashvili won the game and the tournament. Malakhov could have enforced the rules but said that he was too shocked to react. Azmaiparashvili made chess news in 2004 when, at the closing ceremony of the 36th Chess Olympiad in Calvi√†, he was arrested by local police and subsequently held in custody for several days. The attitude of the event's organizers towards Azmaiparashvili had apparently been soured when, upon his arrival in Spain, he had attempted to secure himself two hotel rooms, claiming he was entitled to one in his capacity as a FIDE vice-president, and another as a player at the event. This sour mood seems to have brought him extra attention at the closing ceremony when he approached the stage, apparently in an attempt to inform FIDE officials that the organizers had neglected to award a prize named in honour of Georgian former Women's World Champion Nona Gaprindashvili. He came into conflict with security officials, and a scuffle broke out resulting in injuries both to Azmaiparashvili and a security agent. There are conflicting claims about the exact nature of said scuffle: a press release from the Olympiad organizers placed the blame squarely on Azmaiparashvili's shoulders, saying that after he had tried to gain admittance to the stage on several occasions he \\"without any previous provocation, assaulted the agent with a head butt to his mouth\\". FIDE, on the other hand, blamed over-zealous policing, saying in their press release that \\"Despite his clear VIP identification, he was severely beaten up by several security guards\\". Azmaiparashvili was due to appear in court on 22 July 2005, but all charges were dropped shortly beforehand. Azmaiparashvili had been criticized earlier in 2004 over arrangements for the 2004 Women's World Chess Championship when female Georgian players Lela Javakhishvili and Ana Matnadze accused him of behaving \\"in a hostile and intimidating manner, using inappropriate and vulgar language and bringing to tears our mothers\\". Azmaiparashvili was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to boost his rating. The tournament, in which he played 18 rounds against significantly weaker opponents, is generally regarded as an illegitimate event.Strumica 1995, Azmai's Answer New in Chess 1996/3, page 5 In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to the Azmaiparashvili incident and similar case involving Alexandru Crisan as \\"open secrets\\", at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics. At the Chess World Cup 2017, where Azmaiparashvili was organizer, he berated player Anton Kovalyov for wearing shorts, racially abusing him with the slur \\"gypsy\\" and demanding that Kovalyov change ten minutes before his scheduled third-round game, leading to Kovalyov withdrawing from the tournament in response. Azmaiparashvili received heavy backlash from the global chess community for this incident, including a condemnation from the Association of Chess Professionals and calls from other players demanding that he be removed from his organization roles. In an interview with Chessbase India, Azmaiparashvili stood by his decision.

The accounting method often gives a more intuitive account of the amortized cost of an operation than either aggregate analysis or the potential method. Note, however, that this does not guarantee such analysis will be immediately obvious; often, choosing the correct parameters for the accounting method requires as much knowledge of the problem and the complexity bounds one is attempting to prove as the other two methods. The accounting method is most naturally suited for proving an O(1) bound on time. The method as explained here is for proving such a bound. The method A set of elementary operations which will be used in the algorithm is chosen and their costs are arbitrarily set to 1. The fact that the costs of these operations may differ in reality presents no difficulty in principle. What is important is that each elementary operation has a constant cost. Each aggregate operation is assigned a \\"payment\\". The payment is intended to cover the cost of elementary operations needed to complete this particular operation, with some of the payment left over, placed in a pool to be used later. The difficulty with problems that require amortized analysis is that, in general, some of the operations will require greater than constant cost. This means that no constant payment will be enough to cover the worst case cost of an operation, in and of itself. With proper selection of payment, however, this is no longer a difficulty; the expensive operations will only occur when there is sufficient payment in the pool to cover their costs. Examples A few examples will help to illustrate the use of the accounting method. =Table expansion= It is often necessary to create a table before it is known how much space is needed. One possible strategy is to double the size of the table when it is full. Here we will use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost of an insertion operation in such a table is O(1). Before looking at the procedure in detail, we need some definitions. Let be a table, an element to insert, num(T) the number of elements in , and size(T) the allocated size of . We assume the existence of operations create_table(n), which creates an empty table of size , for now assumed to be free, and elementary_insert(T,E), which inserts element into a table that already has space allocated, with a cost of 1. The following pseudocode illustrates the table insertion procedure: function table_insert(T, E) if num(T) = size(T) U := create_table(2 √ó size(T)) for each F in T elementary_insert(U, F) T := U elementary_insert(T, E) Without amortized analysis, the best bound we can show for n insert operations is O(n) -- this is due to the loop at line 4 that performs num(T) elementary insertions. For analysis using the accounting method, we assign a payment of 3 to each table insertion. Although the reason for this is not clear now, it will become clear during the course of the analysis. Assume that initially the table is empty with size(T) = m. The first m insertions therefore do not require reallocation and only have cost 1 (for the elementary insert). Therefore, when num(T) = m, the pool has (3 - 1)√óm = 2m. Inserting element m + 1 requires reallocation of the table. Creating the new table on line 3 is free (for now). The loop on line 4 requires m elementary insertions, for a cost of m. Including the insertion on the last line, the total cost for this operation is m + 1. After this operation, the pool therefore has 2m + 3 - (m + 1) = m + 2. Next, we add another m - 1 elements to the table. At this point the pool has m + 2 + 2√ó(m - 1) = 3m. Inserting an additional element (that is, element 2m + 1) can be seen to have cost 2m + 1 and a payment of 3. After this operation, the pool has 3m + 3 - (2m + 1) = m + 2. Note that this is the same amount as after inserting element m + 1. In fact, we can show that this will be the case for any number of reallocations. It can now be made clear why the payment for an insertion is 3. 1 pays for the first insertion of the element, 1 pays for moving the element the next time the table is expanded, and 1 pays for moving an older element the next time the table is expanded. Intuitively, this explains why an element's contribution never \\"runs out\\" regardless of how many times the table is expanded: since the table is always doubled, the newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half. We initially assumed that creating a table was free. In reality, creating a table of size n may be as expensive as O(n). Let us say that the cost of creating a table of size n is n. Does this new cost present a difficulty? Not really; it turns out we use the same method to show the amortized O(1) bounds. All we have to do is change the payment. When a new table is created, there is an old table with m entries. The new table will be of size 2m. As long as the entries currently in the table have added enough to the pool to pay for creating the new table, we will be all right. We cannot expect the first \\\\frac{m}{2} entries to help pay for the new table. Those entries already paid for the current table. We must then rely on the last \\\\frac{m}{2} entries to pay the cost 2m. This means we must add \\\\frac{2m}{m/2} = 4 to the payment for each entry, for a total payment of 3 + 4 = 7.

Articulation allows the operation of locomotives that would otherwise be too large to negotiate a railroad's curves, whether mainlines or special lines with extreme curvature such as logging, industrial, or mountain railways. Articulated locomotives saw service in many nations, but were very popular on narrow-gauge railways in Europe. The largest examples were developed in the United States, where the Union Pacific Big Boy 4-8-8-4s and the Allegheny H-8 2-6-6-6s were some of the largest steam locomotives ever built. Many schemes for articulation were developed over the years. Of these, the Mallet locomotive and its simple- expansion derivative were the most popular, followed by the Garratt type (mostly built in the United Kingdom, popular throughout Europe, Africa and European colonies), and the various geared steam locomotive types, the latter largely used in logging, mining and industry. Most other types saw only limited success. Articulated steam locomotive types =Major types= The major types of articulated locomotive are: * The Fairlie, with two powered trucks under a double boiler, or its Single Fairlie single-boiler derivative with one powered and one unpowered truck (known as a Mason Bogie in the United States). * The Garratt, with an engine unit at each end carrying coal and water supplies, and a boiler unit articulated between them. * The Mallet locomotive, with one fixed engine under the rear of the locomotive and a radially swinging engine unit in front. * The Meyer locomotive, with two powered engine trucks under the locomotive (generally with the cylinders inward). Also, the Kitson-Meyer variant with the trucks spread apart to allow a deeper firebox between them. =Simple expansion= Simple expansion, or simple, articulated steam engines had two sets of equally sized cylinders. High-pressure steam was supplied to all cylinders and exhausted out of the stack once it had been used. The American simple-expansion articulated, thanks largely to the smaller mass of the forward cylinders when compared to the compound-expansion Mallets allowing for higher piston speed, were generally better suited for high speed than their compound cousins. Examples of the \\"simple mallet\\" design include the Union Pacific Big Boys and Challengers, B&O; EM-1s, the majority of Southern Pacific's Cab-Forwards, and the N&W; A-class. =Compound expansion= Compound expansion, or compound, articulated steam engines like Anatole Mallet's original idea, consist of two sets of unequally sized cylinders. The smaller pair of cylinders near the cab was fed with high pressure steam directly from the boiler and then the steam was passed into a pair of low-pressure cylinders at the front, with larger diameter to offset the lower pressure, before exhausting through the smokestack. While the thermal efficiency was greatly improved through the compound use of steam in Mallet designs, the large low-pressure cylinders posed unique limitations, both in terms of loading gauge (the cylinders could only be as large as the track and track-side infrastructure allowed) and in terms of performance at speed. The large and consequently heavier pistons caused stability issues at higher speed, which generally limited compound expansion articulated locomotives to below 30 or 40 miles per hour. A notable exception to this was to be found in later iterations of Norfolk & Western Y-class 2-8-8-2s, which could and did often exceed 50 miles per hour in service as well as being one of the hardest-pulling steam locomotives ever built. =Geared types= There were various types of articulated geared steam locomotive, including: * Climax locomotive * Heisler locomotive * Shay locomotive =Other types= * du Bousquet locomotive * Engerth locomotive * G√∂lsdorf axle * Golw√© locomotive * Hagans locomotive, such as the Prussian T 13 (Hagans variant) * Klien-Lindner locomotive * Krauss-Helmholtz bogie * Lutterm√∂ller axle Electric locomotives There are several classes of articulated electric locomotives of generally two types: * Three sections, where the middle part sits on the two outer parts (similar to the Garratt design), e.g. ** Milwaukee Road class EP-2 ** Swiss crocodile locomotives, :de:SBB Ce 6/8 II and :de:SBB Ce 6/8 III ** DRG Class E 94, :de:DRB-Baureihe E 94 * Two sections which share a central or Jacobs bogie, e.g. ** FS Class E656 operating in Italy ** Rhaetian Railway Ge 6/6 II in Switzerland ** New Zealand EW class, built by English Electric in 1952.

In the west, the Leiblach river forms the border to the German county (Landkreis) of Lindau. History The Habsburgs ruled over their Vorarlberg lands alternately from Tyrol and Further Austria. From 1805 to 1814 Lochau belonged to Bavaria, then reverted back to Austria. In 1861 it became part of the Austrian Federal State of Vorarlberg. During World War II, a subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located there. Between 1945 and 1955 the municipality was part of the French occupation zone in Austria.

It's the load at which the structure is in a state of incipient plastic collapse. As the load on the structure increases, the displacements increases linearly in the elastic range until the load attains the yield value. Beyond this, the load-displacement response becomes non-linear and the plastic or irreversible part of the displacement increases steadily with the applied load. Plasticity spreads throughout the solid and at the limit load, the plastic zone becomes very large and the displacements become unbounded and the component is said to have collapsed. Any load above the limit load will lead to the formation of plastic hinge in the structure. Engineers use limit states to define and check a structure's performance. Bounding Theorems of Plastic-Limit Load Analysis: Plastic limit theorems provide a way to calculate limit loads without having to solve the boundary value problem in continuum mechanics. Finite element analysis provides an alternative way to estimate limit loads. They are: * The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem * The Lower Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem * The Lower Bound Shakedown Theorem * The Upper Bound Shakedown Theorem The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem states that an upper bound to the collapse loads can be obtained by postulating a collapse mechanism and computing the ratio of its plastic dissipation to the work done by the applied loads.

History  Noritake porcelain (1920s) In 1876, Ichizaemon Morimura VI and his brother Toyo founded Morimura Gumi with the intent of establishing overseas trading by a Japanese company. By 1878, Toyo had established a business in New York selling Japanese antiques and other goods, including pottery. The company was renamed Morimura Brothers in 1881. By the 1890s, the company had shifted from retail to wholesale operations and started working on design improvements for the pottery and porcelain ware, which had become one third of its business. By 1899, all of the pottery and porcelain decorating factories in Tokyo and Kyoto had been consolidated in Nagoya, and the company started research on creating European style hard white porcelain in Japan. In 1904, key members of this trading company created the Nippon Toki Kaisha, Ltd. (\\"the Company that makes Japan's Finest China\\") in Japan. A new factory was built in Noritake, near Nagoya (now Noritake-shinmachi, Nishi-ku, Nagoya, Aichi). In 1914 the company succeeded in creating their first Western style dinner set, called \\"Sedan\\", to compete with European porcelain companies. Nippon Toki wares were mostly aimed at the European Market. This forerunner of the modern Noritake Company was founded in the village of Noritake, a small suburb near Nagoya, Japan. Most of the company‚Äôs early wares carried one of the various ‚ÄúNippon‚Äù back stamps to indicate its country of origin when exported to Western markets. Today, many collectors agree that the best examples of ‚ÄúNippon-era‚Äù (1891‚Äì1921) hand painted porcelain carry a back stamp used by \\"Noritake\\" during the Nippon era. Noritake porcelain (2009) By 1923, Nippon Toki was looking to streamline its paperwork using machines to handle large orders coming in from the United States, and was impressed by the Hollereth tabulating machines manufactured by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). In May 1925, Morimura- Brothers entered into a sole agency agreement with CTR (which had been renamed IBM in 1924) to import the Hollerith machines into Japan. The first Hollerith tabulator in Japan was installed at Nippon Pottery in September 1925, making Noritake IBM customer #1 in Japan. In 1939, Noritake started selling industrial grinding wheels based on its porcelain finishing technology. It now provides ceramic and diamond grinding and abrasive solutions for many industries. Other products currently manufactured by Noritake, also derived from its core tableware manufacturing technologies, include thick film circuit substrates, engineering ceramics, ceramic powder, and vacuum fluorescent displays, as well as heating furnaces and kilns, mixing technology, filtration systems, and cutting and grinding machines. Although consumers and collectors alike have called the tableware, \\"Noritake\\" (and/or simply, \\"Nippon\\") since the late 1920s, the Japanese parent company did not officially change its name to the Noritake Co., Limited until 1981. Evidently, since Noritake is the name of a place, the company was initially prohibited from registering the name as a trade name.< The Noritake Garden in Nagoya features the production of its ceramics. Overseas Australia Noritake Australia Pty Ltd was established in 1958 and it is owned by Noritake Co., Limited. By the late 1960s Noritake brand had become a household name. Noritake is an official in-flight supplier to Qantas Airways and the brand has worked together with the airline and Australian designer Marc Newson to create a crockery range for Qantas International First and Business. Noritake Australia also distributes industrial grinding wheels in the Australian market. References  Literature  * Neff Alden, Aimee, Collector Books.

Plot A Japanese minister of defence is traveling to Paris to sign a weapons contract between Japan and France, but first, he is visiting Marseille to view and rate the city police's anti gang tactics (using fake attacks on him). During the visit, however, he is kidnapped by a group working for the Japanese yakuza. Emilien (Fr√©d√©ric Diefenthal) is determined to rescue the minister and detective Petra (Emma Sj√∂berg), his girlfriend who was also kidnapped, and restore the honour of his department. Once again, speed demon taxi driver Daniel (Samy Naceri) is called upon to save the day with his high speed driving skills.

Yuki Tsumoto Production =Development= Production started immediately after the massive success of the first film in the theaters, but this time Besson wanted to up his share of the split with the production company ARP to 70/30 from 50/50. Lead of ARP and Besson's friend P√©tin grit his teeth, as he had carried the first project, but he agreed. The director of the first film G√©rard Pir√®s was replaced by G√©rard Krawczyk, who detractors say was more controllable, but who responded back stating he did what he wanted without needing to respect the scenarios laid by Besson. =Cameraman death= On Monday August 16, 1999, only two weeks into filming, Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix was closed for traffic for the length between Porte Dauphine and Porte Maillot. The Peugeot 406 had to come speeding out of the tunnel, head on to the springboard, jump over two AMX-30 tanks and land on a bed of boxes and mattresses. After an unsuccessful first try, the stunt coordinator R√©my Julienne with 35 years of experience and credit of 4000 films including six James Bond Films, decided to increase the incline of the springboard a bit and also up the car's running speed. On the second take, the taxi took off faster and higher, landing a few meters further than expected, hitting the 41-year-old cameraman Alain Dutartre, his assistant and a third person. Dutartre died a few hours later in the hospital. The assistant also broke both of his legs. Besson was in Los Angeles at the time and was contacted immediately. He flew to the set, where detectives were already investigating the matter. Filming had to continue, but did so in a somber mood. In June 2002, Luc Besson was summoned to court. Authorities alleged safety was compromised in an effort to cut costs. The stunt coordinator R√©my Julienne was given a one month suspended jail sentence, and fined ‚Ç¨13,000. Luc Besson, Grenet and director Gerard Krawczyk were initially cleared of charges. But the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in June 2009, and EuropaCorp was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and ordered to pay ‚Ç¨100,000. Julienne's jail sentence was reduced to six months, and his fine was reduced from ‚Ç¨13,000 to ‚Ç¨2,000, but he was required to pay the Dutartre family ‚Ç¨50,000 in court costs. Reception =Box office= The film garnered 10.3 million admissions in France (19th highest in 2006) and 5 million in 37 other countries worldwide. It also had good TV ratings with 10 million viewers on TF1. =Critical response= Neil Smith, reviewing the film for BBC, gave it two stars out of five and writes that it's a \\"virtual reprise of the 1998 French box-office smash\\" and while \\"there's very little of merit in this tongue-in-cheek actioner, it at least delivers the requisite amount of high-octane thrills.\\" References External links  * Category:2000 films Category:2000s action comedy films Category:2000s action thriller films Category:2000s buddy comedy films Category:Films about organized crime in France Category:Films directed by G√©rard Krawczyk Category:Films produced by Luc Besson Category:Films set in Marseille Category:Films set in Paris Category:French films Category:French- language films Category:French action thriller films Category:French action comedy films Category:French sequel films Category:Taxi (film series) Category:Yakuza films Category:2000 comedy films ","title":"Taxi 2"},{"id":"1124051","text":"It's a Beautiful Day is an American band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1967, featuring vocalist Pattie Santos along with violinist David LaFlamme and his wife, Linda LaFlamme, on keyboards. David LaFlamme, who as a youth had once performed as a soloist with the Utah Symphony Orchestra, had previously been in the group Orkustra playing five-string violin. The other members of It's a Beautiful Day in its early years were Hal Wagenet (guitar), Mitchell Holman (bass), and Val Fuentes (drums). Although they were one of the notable San Francisco bands to emerge from 1967's Summer of Love, the band never achieved the success of contemporaries such as Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Santana, with whom they had connections. The band created a unique blend of rock, jazz, folk, classical, and world-beat styles during its first seven years. Early history: 1967‚Äì1969 The band's original manager, Matthew Katz, had previously worked with the rock bands Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape. The members of the band were unaware that the other two bands were already trying to end their business relationships with Katz. During 1967 and early 1968, Katz prevented It's a Beautiful Day from performing in San Francisco, telling them they were not ready. He booked their first public appearances at a club he controlled in Seattle, Washington, formerly known as the Encore Ballroom. Katz renamed the club San Francisco Sound. While in Seattle, the group lived in the attic of an old house owned by Katz while writing and rehearsing new songs in between club performances. Few customers came to the club during the band's engagement in Seattle during December 1967. The band's signature song \\"White Bird\\" was inspired by the experiences David and Linda LaFlamme had while living in Seattle. In an ironic twist on the band's name, the sad song was partly inspired by Seattle's rainy winter weather. In a later interview, David LaFlamme said: :\\"Where the 'white bird' thing came from ... We were like caged birds in that attic. We had no money, no transportation, the weather was miserable. We were just barely getting by on a very small food allowance provided to us. It was quite an experience, but it was very creative in a way.\\" By the time the group members returned to San Francisco they had no money and were frustrated by Katz's attempts to manipulate their career. In desperation, they began playing at a few clubs without Katz's approval. The band gradually began to gain some recognition and earn money. Some of that recognition came from their performance at the Sky River Rock Festival and Lighter Than Air Fair, occurring over the 1968 Labor Day weekend in Sultan, Washington. Sky River is considered by many to be the first successful multi-day rock festival, and a number of major bands had the opportunity to hear It's a Beautiful Day there. The band got its first big break when offered a chance to open for Cream at the Oakland Coliseum, in Oakland, California on October 4, 1968. Around this time, the band first began a long process of trying to disentangle themselves from Katz. The band's debut album, It's a Beautiful Day, was produced by David LaFlamme in Los Angeles, California, and released by Columbia Records in 1969. It features tracks such as \\"White Bird\\", \\"Hot Summer Day\\", and \\"Time Is\\". The album reached number 47 in the U.S. charts\\"It's a Beautiful Day USA chart history\\". Allmusic. Retrieved June 10, 2012. and number 58 in the UK.\\"It's a Beautiful Day UK chart history\\". The Official Charts Company. Retrieved June 10, 2012. The theme from the song \\"Bombay Calling\\" was later used, at a slower tempo, by Deep Purple as the intro to \\"Child in Time\\" on its Deep Purple in Rock album. The vocals and violin playing of David LaFlamme plus Santos's singing attracted FM radio play attention, and nationally, \\"White Bird\\" bubbled under Billboard's Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 118. It's a Beautiful Day was almost invited to play at Woodstock. When Michael Lang was negotiating with Bill Graham to get the Grateful Dead to appear, Graham insisted Lang put one of two other acts that he also managed on the bill. Lang then listened to a tape of both It's a Beautiful Day and the other band and liked them both so much that he couldn't decide, so he flipped a coin and It's a Beautiful Day lost. The band that won was Santana, which became famous due to its performance. 1970s and beyond July 5, 1970, the band played the second Atlanta International Pop Festival in Byron, Georgia to an estimated 250,000 people. Pattie Santos sang lead on \\"White Bird\\", \\"Hot Summer Day\\" and \\"The Dolphin Song\\". The band had a regional radio hit with \\"Don and Dewey\\". Later that year, the original lineup of the band changed; the LaFlammes had split and Linda left the band, replaced by Fred Webb. The following album, Marrying Maiden, recorded at Pacific High Recording Studio in San Francisco, released in 1970, was their most successful in the charts. It reached number 28 in the U.S. (their only Top 40 placing) and number 45 in the U.K. In that year, the band also performed at the Holland Pop Festival at the Kralingse Bos in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. Tom Fowler (later bassist for Frank Zappa) and Bill Gregory joined in March 1971, with their first performance broadcast live on San Francisco's KSAN FM radio, with host Tom Donahue introducing them as the band's two new members. In July 1971, the band was one of the last acts to appear at Fillmore West in San Francisco. Its performance of \\"White Bird\\" appeared as part of the musical documentary film Fillmore (1972). The band continued to record Choice Quality Stuff/Anytime in 1971, the live album Live at Carnegie Hall in 1972 and It's A Beautiful Day...Today in 1973, touring until 1974 when it split up after violinist Gregory Bloch left to join the Italian progressive rock group Premiata Forneria Marconi and later the Saturday Night Live Band. In 1976, LaFlamme's solo version of \\"White Bird\\" finally cracked the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 89\\\\. Patti Santos, who together with her husband, former group bassist Bud Cockrell (also original bassist with Pablo Cruise), had formed Cockrell & Santos in 1977, was killed in a car crash near Geyserville in Sonoma County, California on December 14, 1989. Cockrell himself died in 2010. It's a Beautiful Day reunited occasionally for reunions and special concerts. The band's music continued under the name David LaFlamme Band as well as It's a Beautiful Day until Katz let his trademark of the name go un-renewed. Since 2000, It's a Beautiful Day features founder David LaFlamme and original drummer Fuentes. Other band members are LaFlamme's current wife, whom he met in 1974, Linda Baker LaFlamme (vocals), Toby Gray (basses and producer), Gary Thomas (keyboards and producer), Rob Espinosa (guitars) and Michael Prichard (percussion). They continue performing today, with LaFlamme contributing to Jefferson Starship's 2008 release, Jefferson's Tree of Liberty.

The route begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some away.As of September 2018, although the section 10.5-kilometere section to Kincraig is now open, both the official website and the Scotland's Great Trails website continue to state the distance with reference to Aviemore as the southern start/finish point. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore. There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to . In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked. Sections of the route are open to cycling. The Way is clearly waymarked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon. The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline. The route was established in 1981, and is managed by three authorities: Highland Council, Moray Council and the Cairngorms National Park Authority. It is listed as one of Scotland's Great Trails by NatureScot, and links directly to two further Great Trails: the Moray Coast Trail and the Dava Way. About 53,000 people use the path every year, of whom about 3,000 complete the entire route. Extension to Newtonmore An extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway, lengthening the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015, and the Cairngorms National Park Authority are continuing work to complete the extension to Newtonmore. The extension was approved in principle by Scottish Ministers in May 2009 and agreement was reached with all but one landowner - the owner of the Kinrara Estate. The Cairngorms National Park Authority resolved in May 2010 to use the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to apply for the route to be implemented against landowner's wishes. In 2012, Scotland's first Path Order was granted, forcing the owner of the Kinrara Estate to allow the path to cross his land. In July 2017 the estate erected locked gates, blocking members of the public who have a right to roam, but the issue was resolved by the following month.Kinrara gates in Cairngorms National Park re-opened.

The site, notified as SSSI in 1958, is an outcrop of Millstone Grit, with small areas of birch woodland and a large area of wet and dry heath. The site is known for its water- and weather-eroded rocks, which were formed over 325 million years ago and have assumed fantastic shapes. In the 18th and 19th centuries, antiquarians such as Hayman Rooke wondered whether they could have been at least partly carved by druids, an idea that ran concurrently with the popularity of James Macpherson's Fragments of Ancient Poetry of 1760, and a developing interest in New-Druidism. For up to two hundred years, some stones have carried fanciful names, such as Druid's Idol, Druid's Altar and Druid's Writing Desk. Brimham Rocks has SSSI status because of the value of its geology and the upland woodland and the acidic wet and dry heath habitats that support localised and specialised plant forms, such as chickweed wintergreen, cowberry, bog asphodel and three species of heather. Site location and SSSI designation Heath, 2017 Brimham Rocks is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site, south of Ripon on Brimham Moor in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in North Yorkshire. It is north of Summerbridge and east of Pateley Bridge and the River Nidd. The site is managed by the National Trust along with a visitor's centre, public facilities and a car park. Under normal circumstances Brimham Rocks is open throughout the year between around 8.30 am and dusk, but , was closed until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom. The site was SSSI notified in 1958, with revisions in 1984 and on 19 February 1988. The site was listed for the value of its geology and because the \\"heath and bog habitats represent important examples of plant communities, formerly more widespread, which have been reduced by agricultural improvement, drainage and afforestation.\\" Associated with the more well-known rocky outcrops, are birch woodland, acidic bogs, wet and dry heath, and plant communities which thrive when sheltered between the rocks and exposed on the moor. Geology Turtle Rock, showing cross-bedding Brimham Rocks are formed from a medium to coarse sandstone known both as the Lower Brimham Grit and also as the Lower Plompton Grit, one of a series of such sandstones laid down in the later part of the Carboniferous period in what is now the Pennine region. In formal terms this particular grit which is between 10 and 30m thick, forms a part of the Hebden Formation, itself a sub-unit of the Millstone Grit Group. It was deposited 318-317 million years ago during the Kinderscoutian substage of the Bashkirian stage. The rock which has traditionally been referred to as Millstone Grit, originated as river-deposited sands in a delta environment and contains both feldspar and quartz pebbles. Deposition from moving water has resulted in the cross-bedding which is very evident in most of the outcrops. Brimham Rocks has been described as \\"a classic geomorphological site, significant for studies of past and present weathering processes and their contribution to landscape evolution.\\" Although discussion continues around the formation and date of tors such as these throughout Britain, much of the development into the forms displayed at Brimham is likely to have taken place over the last 100,000 years before, during and after the last ice age ‚Äì the Devensian. Some disintegration of the rock strata may have occurred along weaknesses such as fault and fracture planes whilst still buried. Sub-aerial weathering has continued the process. The outcrops were exposed when glacial action, gelifluction and further weathering and water erosion removed the loose material which separated them. During periods of harsher climate, windblown-ice as well as particles of sand and dust have more effectively eroded weaker layers to give rise to these wind-carved shapes. Such processes have created holes in some rocks, and left dust on the ground below. Erosion continues, caused by weather and tourist numbers. One possibility for the mushroom shape of some stones is that they were exposed to sandblasting at ground level when an ice cap melted 18,000 years ago, narrowing the bases of outcrops, then they were subject to all-over sandblasting when the ice had gone, causing the irregular shapes. Due to this process the Idol rock, for example, will not exist for ever. =Druidic theories= oracular stone (now called Smartie Tube) It was not until the early 20th century that it was understood that the rocks were created by natural forces. During the 18th and 19th centuries, some writers theorised that the rock-shaping could have been enhanced by Druidic carving. Their theories coincided with the growth of Neo-Druidism, and followed the 1760 publication of James Macpherson's Fragments of Ancient Poetry. After a lecture in 1786, the opinion of the antiquary Hayman Rooke was reported in 1788 with mild scepticism by the Sheffield Register: > \\"The extraordinary position of these rocks is supposed to have been owing to > some violent convulsion of nature, but it is evident, we are told, that art > has not been wanting to render their situation yet more remarkable. > Fragments of rocks obtained great regard, even veneration, from people of > very remote antiquity: here they are found placed one on another, some > having plainly the marks of the tool. This writer, though he does not > venture to determine, conjectures that they are the work of the Druids. The > Britons having had early communication with the Egyptians and Phoenicians, > it is probable, he thinks, that the Latter imparted their arts and religious > ceremonies to the Druids, who would politically conceal them from the > people, that by means of auguries and divinations, the greater submission > might be yielded to their decrees. To purposes of this kind Mr Rooke > imagines these rocks to have been destined. They are various forms, some are > rock-idols, others are rocking-stones, several have been perforated, in one > instance, at least, quite through. To these our author assigns the name of > the oracular stone, supposing that hence the crafty Druids might contrive to > deliver predictions and commands which the credulous people would receive as > proceeding from the rock-deity. It is well known, that many, who enjoyed far > superior advantages for religious knowledge, have in later times employed > such deceitful and scandalous methods to promote their ambitious and > tyrannical views. (Whether it was thus in the very remote and uncultured > periods to which Mr Rooke alludes, must remain in the uncertainty wherein > time has involved this with many other points of historical disquisition).\\" In 1844, Druidic theories were strong enough for the Worcester Journal to publish a list of \\"British monuments, commonly called Druidical,\\" to correct misunderstandings, including those by \\"antiquarian writers of celebrity.\\" The list included the Rock Idol at Brimham Rocks. By 1849 John Richard Walbran, writing about erosion as the cause of the rocks' shapes, hesitated to support Druidical theories. Nevertheless, in 1849, Druidic theories were still influential. John Williams (Ab Ithel), described Brimham Rocks in a poetic manner as if they were partly created by the hand of man: \\"Brimham Rocks, where amidst great natural acclivities, and on the verge of precipices, ancient architects of the school of the builders of the Tomb of Laius, seem to have derived an intense pleasure in vanquishing and triumphing over the difficulties which nature opposed to their exertions.\\" By 1890 Druidic theories were dying out, leaving some rock names to bear witness to past ideas. The Pateley Bridge & Nidderdale Herald quoted from Professor Phillips' Geology of Yorkshire: > \\"The wasting power of the atmosphere is very consipicuous in these rocks; > searching out their secret lamination; working perpendicular furrows and > horizontal cavities; wearing away the bases, and thus bringing slow but sure > destruction on the whole of the exposed masses. Those that remain of the > rocks of Brimham are but perishing memorials of what have been destroyed.\\" =Rock names= Great Cannon is one of the earliest rock names on this site Many of the rock names have been used for over a hundred years. Some fanciful names may have been invented by the Rocks House caretakers in their efforts to amuse visitors. Some appear to have been inspired by antiquarians who adhered to Druidical theories about their origins. Just a few names, such as the Noonstone whose shadow indicated midday, and old local names, Great Cannon and Little Cannon (now the Smartie Tube), may come from an earlier tradition. In his 1786 lecture, Some account of the Brimham rocks in Yorkshire, Hayman Rooke mentions the Idol Rock, the Great Cannon, and the Noonstone next to which a fire was lit on Midsummer Eve. In 1844 the Worcester Journal mentions the Rock Idol, and in 1843 the Leeds Times mentions the Rocking Stones, Lovers' Leap, Baboon's Head, Pulpit Rock, Parson's Head, Yoke of Oxen, Frog and Tortoise, Serpent's Head, Dancing Bear, Druid's Writing Desk, Druid's Aerial Altar, Druid's Coffin, Sphinx, Oyster Shell, Mushroom, Idol Rock, and Cannon Rocks. In 1849 J.R. Walbran mentions the Rocking Stones and illustrates the Anvil and Porpoise Head. In 1906 the writer Harry Speight mentions the Elephant Rock, the Porpoise Head, the Dancing Bear, the Boat Rock, the Idol and the Rocking Stones. The identity of the Porpoise Head rock has been forgotten, although it appears in a drawing by Walbran. The mention of Druids appears in Brimham Rocks, the wonder of Nidderdale (ca.1920) by journalist Herbert W. Ogle (1871‚Äì1940) of Otley. He lists Druid's Head, Druid's Writing desk, Druid's Castle, Druid's Pulpit, Druid's Parlour, Druid's Kitchen, Druid's Coffin, Druid's telescope \\"and so on.\\" The Parlour and Kitchen no longer exist. At the far end of the Eye of the Needle were once the Druid's Caves, which included a Parlour and Bedroom, but they have been exposed or obliterated by a rock fall. Other rock names mentioned in 1920 are Oyster Shell, Rocking Stones, Baboon Rock, Mushroom Rock, Wishing Rock, Yoke of Oxen, Boat Rock (also known as the Druid's Altar), Boat Rocking Stone (\\"first discovered to be movable in 1786\\"), Dancing Bear, Rhinoceros Head, Anvil Rock, Pivot Rock, Lovers' Leap, Frog and Tortoise, Cannon Rocks, Split Rock, Sphinx Rock, Rabbit Rock, Elephant's Head, Dog Rock (possibly the Watchdog) and Tiger's Head.

Some recent rock names in use are Meerkat and Smartie Tube. Biological site content Peat was once dug on Brimham Moor. Heather-burning, grazing, management for shooting, and air pollution from industrialisation plus two hundred years of footfall from visitors, has limited biodiversity especially around the rocky outcrop. Some of the heath has not been affected. =Flora= At the east side of the Brimham Rocks site cowberry grows, it is \\"a northern species found mostly in Yorkshire.\\" On the dry heathland by the rocks, on shallow soil with sand, grows a scattering of oak, rowan and silver birch, although its main cover is wavy hair-grass, bilberry, bell heather and ling, with bracken under the rock stacks. Birch grows on the north-east side in a regenerating forest. Until at least 1920, crowberry used to grow here. In the north woodland is chickweed wintergreen, which is \\"uncommon\\" and \\"of note.\\" Bell Heather - geograph.org.uk - 493968.jpgBell heather Besenheide (Calluna vulgaris).jpgLing Vaccinium myrtillus vaisiai 2006-07-25.JPGBilberry 2006-11-28Vaccinium02-03.jpgCowberry Arctic Starflower (3600344148).jpgChickweed wintergreen 20150613Avenella flexuosa1.jpgWavy hair-grass At the southern end of the site is wet heath which has shallow soil with peat, and a beck, and this habitat supports wood horsetail, marsh thistle, water blinks, marsh violet, and \\"Yorkshire's largest colonies of bog asphodel.\\" The heath contains wet patches within the dry area where it is possible to find cranberry. Other wet heath plants are cross-leaved heath, bog mosses, purple moor-grass, deer grass and common cotton grass.

Kottenforst-Rothirsch.jpgRed deer Corzo.jpgRoe deer SikaDeerM1.jpgSika deer Birds National Trust rangers and volunteers monitor birds and bird boxes. The bird boxes have attracted tawny owl, treecreeper, spotted flycatcher (RSPB red-listed), redstart (RSPB amber listed), nuthatch, pied flycatcher, great tit and blue tit. Raptors seen over the rocks include: red kite, buzzard and kestrel. House martins and swallows fly around the rocks in summer, and on the heath are meadow pipit and red grouse. In February 2014, members of Harrogate District Naturalists' Society (HDNS) reported stonechat, wren and snipe.

Colletes succinctus (39387901414).jpgSolitary bee Colletes succinctus Maintenance The National Trust has a Countryside and Community Manager at Brimham Rocks to oversee maintenance. On all habitats on this site, fertiliser and pesticides would harm the flora and fauna, and should not be used. The use of herbicide is discouraged, it should be used with \\"extreme care.\\" A selective herbicide is used on bracken, however. A high proportion of the Brimham Rocks site is recognised common land, where local farmers may graze their livestock. National Trust wardens work the year round to maintain this site. The work includes maintaining visitor paths and roads, bird-recording, controlling bracken and silver birch, and removing litter and storm-damaged trees. =Rocks= Where appropriate, the rocks should be kept clear of vegetation and rock debris, so that the geology remains visible. Building developments and trees should not conceal the exposed rocks. \\"Widespread rock climbing activities and high visitor numbers ... need to be balanced with the protection of the rock features.\\" Collecting of geological specimens is not allowed. =Heath= The plants on both wet and dry upland heath have developed a requirement for acidic and nutrient-poor soil, which is at least partially affected by underlying layers of sphagnum moss, or peat. Thus the prevalent mixture of low shrubs, heather and cottongrass will support a large number of animals and insects. Careful maintenance of dry heath requires just enough livestock grazing to keep down trees and shrubs, but minimum winter grazing to protect those same shrubs. Animal feed should not be placed on this habitat because its detritus and animal dung would enrich the soil. Where necessary, grazing should be temporarily withheld, to allow the vegetation to recover. Although as of 2020 local farmers have not used their grazing rights recently, the National Trust may reintroduce this heath maintenance method. Most wet heaths require little management, but if necessary a little light grazing may be used to prevent encroachment of trees and shrubs. Heavy grazing should be avoided on wet heath because it damages the peaty soil. Heather- burning should only take place with the agreement of English Nature, because burning can destroy adjacent woods, destroy some plants, destroy cover for certain nesting birds, encourage erosion, and encourage dominance of bracken and gorse. Cutting, if done without machinery, is a good alternative to burning, because it preserves the soil. Artificial drainage of wet heath is discouraged, because it would change the nature of the habitat. =Woodland= This is upland, semi-natural woodland. The clean air and high rainfall have made it a habitat for flora and fauna which is less commonly found in lowland woodland. However, beneficial previous and present management of this woodland has protected it from overgrazing, allowing plants and animals to proliferate. Where appropriate, woodland may be protected from livestock by fencing, it may be partially coppiced to let in light, or trees may be allowed to grow and die naturally. Invasive, not-native plants such as rhododendron should be removed. Wet woodland should be left alone where possible, allowing trees to grow and fall naturally. Any underplanted conifers should be removed. The mix of plants where the woodland and heath blend should be retained. Development and risk assessment For assessment, Natural England has divided the site into five units. Numbers one (), two () and four () are described as upland dwarf shrub heath, and units three () and five () are upland broadleaved mixed and yew woodland. The units were assessed in 2012 and 2013, when all units were adjudged unfavourable and recovering, except unit 4 which was favourable. Plans for management of units 1 and 2 were in place, and recovery was expected. That left woodland units 3 and 5 still with problems. Woodland from unit 3 was encroaching onto unit 1 (supposed to be heath). Unit 3 had not enough ground flora, although it did have naturally regenerating trees. The problem with woodland unit 5 is that there was almost no understorey, and not enough ground cover plants, although it did have some new saplings. Both wood units 3 and 5 had some encroaching bracken. Unit 4, the visitor attraction with the rocks, was considered favourable because visitor damage did not appear noticeable, and there were not too many plants concealing the geology. The trees which conceal views from the rocks were not mentioned. Nevertheless, the rocky part of the site receives more than 175,000 people including families, climbers, naturalists and others every year, and this does affect the biodiversity of the rocky section. On 17 February 2018 at Brimham Rocks the Police, the North Yorkshire National Parks and the RSPB launched Operation Owl, \\"an initiative to tackle the illegal persecution of birds of prey in the county. This was because North Yorkshire had the highest raptor persecution record in the country, and they wanted to do \\"random swoops\\" in places where they believed this might be happening. They were also asking the public to report \\"illegal pole traps, poisoned bait and habitat disturbance, associated with \\"shooting interests.\\" Pole traps are \\"spring-loaded traps fixed to the top of posts which have been outlawed since Victorian times.\\" The traps themselves are legal for catching vermin (e.g. rats) if used low on the ground and in tunnels, but are illegal on poles where birds will be killed. In September 2018 a group of climbers assisted the National Trust in \\"to return many of the locations between Cubic Block and Titfield Thunderbolt at Brimham to their previous airy and open state,\\" that is, they removed large trees and other growth which had caused obstructions to the climbing experience at Brimham Rocks. At 8.45 pm on 1 June 2018, in \\"an act of mindless destruction,\\" five youths were observed destroying one of Brimham Rocks' balancing stones by pushing it from its high spot so that it broke on the ground. The balancing stone had taken 320 million years to form by erosion. Site history Hayman Rooke found barrows and stone circles in this area before 1786: > \\"About eighty yards S.W. of the ... Great Cannon is a large tumulus of earth > and stones one hundred and fifty feet in circumference: on the west side > there seems to have been a little ditch and vallum, which probably inclosed > the tumulus ... About a quarter of a mile farther to the west is a Druid > circle, with a vallum of earth and stones, thirty feet diameter. It is > exactly of the same construction as those on Stanton Moor, in the peak of > Derbyshire. There are likewise several small tumuli. Thirteen of them are > arranged in a kind of circle, the largest not above eighteen feet diameter. > They are formed of earth and large stones. Two of these I opened: towards > the bottom the effects of fire appeared on the stones, and ashes were > scattered about, but there were no urns to be fournd.\\" Katie Croft, in the National Trust guidebook, Brimham Rocks (2009), says that these barrows have not been found. The name, Birnebeam, or Birnebaha, meaning \\"tree in clearing,\\" refers to Brimham in the Domesday Book of 1086. Fountains Abbey owned it as pasture by 1252, and had a fishpool, then at the Reformation it reverted to The Crown from the 1530s. It was granted to Richard Gresham, then in 1780 Lord Grantley bought it. Brimham Moor was fox-hunting country by the 18th century, used by Colonel Thornton's Hunt. Later, around 1827, the Earl of Harewood's foxhounds would meet at the crossroads on Brimham Moor, making it possible to hunt across the Rocks since there could be no standing crops there. In April 1842 several newspapers voiced disappointment that \\"the appearance of that beautiful spot called Brimham Rocks ... has been greatly injured by the burning off of all the moss &c.; with which they were formerly covered.\\" The identity of the offenders was unknown. In early May of the same year, vandals set the moorland around Brimham Rocks on fire several times, taking advantage of a severe drought. A newspaper report of 1846 gives a glimpse of local life and an odd reference to Brimham Rocks. At an August Ripon Race meeting, a nameless five-year-old brown mare, who was both a hunter and also a daughter of Sheet Anchor, was disqualified after some drama. > \\"The Sheet Anchor mare, whose Jockey was attired in very primitive colours, > and flourished a stout ash sapling, took the lead at a furious pace, came > tearing past the Grand Stand, amidst loud cries of, Hurrah for Pateley Brig > and kept it once round, when the instant he was headed, his cudgel was > brought into vigorous play, but all to no purpose, though he belaboured her > in true Brimham Rocks style to the very confines of the distance, which he > failed to reach in time.\\" =Crime= In August 2014 the body of Gemma Simpson was found at Brimham Rocks. That December Martin Bell, a schizophrenic, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and was sentenced to a minimum of twelve years' imprisonment. In May 2000 he had smoked cannabis with her, \\"bludgeoned and stabbed\\" her to death, left her in a bath for some days, dismembered her, then buried her body at a secret location at Brimham Rocks for fourteen years. In July 2014 he confessed to the murder and disclosed the location of the body, at Scarborough police station. Tourism =History of Rocks House= Rocks House with Tea House and market garden, pre-1914 This is a Grade II listed building, built in 1792 for Lord Grantley, who used it as a hunting lodge and \\"for the accommodation of visitors,\\" who came to see the rocks for their sublime aesthetic. The visitor's centre, now called Brimham House, used to be called The Rocks House or Rock House, and between around 1792 and 1900 it was the home of Brimham Rocks' caretakers, and run as a souvenir shop, with an adjacent wooden tea house. In 1838, Rock House provided \\"tea, coffee or luncheon ... lemonade, ginger beer and cigars ... hay, corn and good stabling for horses,\\" plus the use of a telescope. The building decayed and was temporarily replaced with a caravan as a makeshift cafe parked below the house steps, but in the 1970s the National Trust restored Rocks House. From 1987 there has been a shop and information centre at the house, which has been extended for staff accommodation, and fitted with solar panels. At some point in the 20th century, Rocks House was renamed Brimham House. =Tenants, caretakers and guides= John Spooner: John Spooner (ca.1724‚Äì22 November 1819) was one of the earliest tourist guides here. His death-notice described him as \\"the well-known guide at Brimham Rocks.\\" He was 95 years old when he died, and he \\"had been for more than thirty years successively the strangers' attendant at Brimham Rocks ... This veteran was very generally known.\\" Richard and Hannah Weatherhead: In late 1836, Rocks House tenants Richard (Hartwith ca.1802 ‚Äì Pateley Bridge 1877) Deaths Dec 1877 Weatherhead Richard 74 Pateley B. 9a 55 and Hannah (Hartwith ca.1796 ‚Äì Pateley Bridge 1885)1871 England Census Hartwith RG10/4274 p9, Schedule 47 Deaths Mar 1885 Weatherhead Hannah 88 Pateley B. 9a 53 Weatherhead were fined ¬£50 with ¬£4 costs \\"for selling spirituous liquors and tobacco without a licence.\\" They had already been fined ¬£25 that year for the same offence, but nevertheless paid up immediately. The Yorkshire Gazette said that \\"it may be presumed that they have a pretty good trade.\\" By 1862 the couple were providing guided tours, besides a continuation of the refreshment business at Rocks House, with teas besides \\"refreshments.\\" Richard Weatherhead used to recite Wordsworth while gesticulating with his stick, on the guided tours. J.R. Walbran (1849) described them as \\"an original couple, who, for the customary remuneration, regale all comers with tea, coffee, and refreshments, in such Yorkshire style, as many of our fair southern friends will not readily forget.\\" William Brown: William Brown (Ripley ca.1852 ‚Äì Brimham Rocks 24 May 1914) Births Dec 1851 Brown William Knaresbro' XXIII 443Deaths Jun 1914 Brown William 62 Knaresbro 9a 134 became tenant in 1882, using Rocks House for visitor entertainment, but farming locally at Mauds Farm.

Brown died at Harrogate Infirmary, and was buried in St Jude's churchyard, Hartwith. At the inquest, the jury recommended that the large North Eastern Railway motor charabancs should no longer be permitted to pass between the rocks between the entrance and Rocks House. There is at least one photograph of such a motor charabanc parked at Rocks House between 1902 and 1914.see :File:Brimham Rocks MSH postcard collection (13).jpg Brimham Rocks, William Brown.jpgWilliam Brown and family on the Rocking Stones, 1882 Brimham Rocks MSH postcard collection (13).jpgView from Rocks House, with motor charabanc, before 1914 St Jude Hartwith 22 February 2020 (1).JPGGravestone of William and Isabel Brown Brimham Rocks 7 Feb 2020 (9).JPGTourist souvenir with fanciful coat of arms, caveman and Druid supporters and pet dog crest, 1900‚Äì1939 Fred and Mary Ann Burn: The next tenants at Rocks House were Fred (Kilburn 1867 ‚Äì Durham 1943) Births Mar 1867 Burn Fred Thirsk 9d 353 Deaths Sep 1943 Burn Fred 76 Durham W. 10a 208 and Mary Ann Burn, who were in residence by 1920.

In the field in front of the house they grew produce, they fed the tourists in the Tea House, an ex-army hut placed next the house, and drew their water at Druid's Cave Farm below the rocks, using a \\"horse-drawn barrel\\" to cart it uphill. In 1928 they caused some embarrassment by charging the Bishop of Ripon and his congregation sixpence per head to attend a service at the Rocks, without the knowledge of Sir William Aykroyd who owned the land. By 1937 they had moved to Durham, and were succeeded by their son-in-law Frank Dale and their daughter Doris at Rocks House, for a year.

It was replaced by a caravan, where Mrs Carrick continued to provide the teas until 1970 when the National Trust assumed responsibility. =Tourists and visitors= Sketch by J. M. W. Turner, 1816 Brimham Rocks, 2013 The status of Brimham Rocks as a tourist attraction began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with about 100 visitors per year. It is still popular as a family venue and for rock climbing, with about 175,000 visitors per year as of 2009. In the late 18th century it was the Sublime aesthetic and the picturesque which inspired admiration for wonderfully strange shapes, and the great size of some of the rocks. In this vein a poem by F.C.S. appeared in the Leeds Intelligencer of 1826, describing a \\"momentary view\\" of the place. The following is an extract: Suddenly, on the horizon's distant line, Uprising, as by call of magic power The farewell sunbeams on the sky define Black shapes of battlement, and spire and tower. Higher, and higher still, the turrets rise - Wider, and wider, the long ramparts spread - Darkly depicted on the glowing skies Behold a mighty city rear its head! By the early 19th century, Romanticism was encouraging imagination and storytelling here. Both the Sublime and Romanticism are reflected in this 1843 report of an autumn ramble at Brimham Rocks: > \\"It is impossible to convey an idea of the wild rude grandeur of the scene. > We stood on the summit of the hill rivetted in astonishment. Huge ruin and > desolation seemed on every side of us, and we thought of that superhuman > battlefield, where the hostile armies of heaven plucked up the seated hills\\" > for missiles, and \\"main promontories flung ... And gazing at the masses of > rock strewn on the ground, in every wild and strange position, one might > imagine that it had been the scene of some such superhuman conflict and that > uptorn rocks, hurled to and fro with jaculation dire had fallen as they are > now seen.\\" During the 19th century the Yorkshire Union of Mechanics' Institutes used to hold its annual conference at Ripon. One of the regular highlights following the procedures was an excursion to Studley Royal, Fountains Abbey and Brimham Rocks. On Wednesday 14 June 1848, the large party arrived with guides John Richard Walbran and Mr Harrison of Ripon, who brought not just \\"antiquarian and topographical knowledge,\\" but also \\"taste.\\" At Brimham rocks, after an \\"excellent repast,\\" the party \\"rambled among the stupendous and fantastic rocks, observing the wonders of nature, and speculating on the extent to which the rude art of our earliest British ancestors might have aided the operations of water and air in producing the present extraordinary forms of the rocks.\\" At this point they were not only joined by the memberships of local Mechanics' Institutes, but also (the event having been heralded in the newspapers) by hundreds of local working people who expected a lecture and received one: a twenty-minute talk on how to form their own mechanics' institutes. The Manchester Courier commented that, \\"The motley group listened with interest and intelligence; and possibly even this handful of corn on the top of the mountain may be the seed of new institutes, which may train up yet unborn communities in the paths of knowledge and virtue.\\" =Tourist transport= Carriages at the Rocks, 19th century By the Harrogate spa Season of 1838, the summer tourists were arriving in hired carriages, and this was a business opportunity for postmaster Christopher Deighton. However he neglected, not for the first time, to pay the excise duty on the hire of a horse and phaeton in February of that year, and was fined ¬£5 with 17 shillings costs. Magistrate C. Oxley said, \\"Depend upon it if you go on in this way you will be convicted in the sum of ¬£5 every time, therefore be careful, as it will take away all your profits.\\" Dacre Banks rail station By the 1840s, many carriages were hired to take people from Harrogate to Brimham Rocks. With the coming of the railways and a rail station at Dacre in 1862, visitors during the Season at Harrogate spa could more easily take excursions to Brimham Rocks, so tourist numbers increased. By 1906 there was a motor bus service from Dacre Banks Station, although a four-in-hand carriage could be hired from Harrogate. During the 20th century and the early 21st century, visitor cars were parked among the rocks, but since 1970, the National Trust has maintained a car park near the entrance, and built an accessible pedestrian path to Rocks House (now called Brimham House or the Visitor Centre) from there. =Tourist accidents= Climbing on the Rocks is highly discouraged. A National Trust spokeswoman said in 2007: \\"In the past 21 years we have had people fall from the rocks.\\" She added: > \\"We don't encourage people to climb on the rocks ... There are signs in > place warning people and encouraging them not to climb on the rocks. There > are very big signs in the car park stating climbing the rocks needs skill > and specialist equipment. The site is regularly checked by wardens and there > are regular audits held on the health and safety angle.\\" On the National Trust Brimham Rocks website there is a warning: \\"Climbing on the rocks can be dangerous and requires skill and special equipment. Please be aware of heights and sudden drops and keep children under close supervision.\\" However, various accidents have been reported at the Rocks. These include: * In May 2007 Ethan Bradley, a teenage boy on a Breckenbrough School field trip, got into difficulties while climbing the Rocks. His right leg was trapped above the ground on Oven Rock. It took the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service several hours to free him with specialist cutting equipment, and the boy was treated and airlifted by the Great North Air Ambulance. The National Trust said that \\"it feels current warning signs are sufficient and does not plan further safety measures.\\" * On 13 February 2016 a 21-year-old man fell from a rock stack on the site and injured his back and pelvis. Ten members of the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association (UWFRA) assisted the paramedics and stretchered the patient to a helicopter run by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance. * In July 2017 a forty-year-old man received \\"serious leg injuries\\" having fallen from a rock stack at the site. The UWFRA assisted an ambulance crew, before the patient was airlifted to a hospital. * In March 2020 a male climber aged 43 years was treated by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service at Brimham Rocks after he fell several metres, injuring his back. The UWFRA team carried him to a road ambulance. Climbing Rock climbers, 2010 As of 2009, around 170 bouldering problems and 200 rock climbing routes have been recorded. By 1920, climbers from Harrogate were already exploring routes up the rocks. Routes were first recorded from the 1930s, by Sidney Thompson and his colleagues, with perhaps 20 routes being put up by 1955. The first climbing guide to Brimham Rocks was published in 1956 in the form of an article in Yorkshire Ramblers' Club Journal. In 1957, various routes were recorded in the same journal, including Cracked Buttress, Lovers' Leap, Hatter's Groove Group, Fag Slab, Hawk Crag, Cannon Rocks, Stelling Crag, Boulders and Bat Buttress. More difficult routes were recorded by the Yorkshire Mountaineering Club between 1957 and 1961, although some of their aid climbing methods are not used now. Local climbers Robin and Tony Barley were putting up new routes for ten years or more until the 1970s, being regularly chased off the rocks by the warden, on the grounds of unpaid entrance fees. From 1970 Leeds University Climbing Club began climbing here. Army cadet training takes place here, and from the 1990s climbers have visited the rocks for bouldering. Adjacent landmarks =Adam's Ale spring= This is one of the many springs outside the SSSI site, and just to the south-west of it. Its name is engraved on a nearby stone. =Brimham Beacon= Beacon Beacon is an ancient, natural promontory. It is just outside the Brimham Rocks SSSI border, at the south end, but being a high point contiguous with the site on Brimham Moor it is connected. Beacons for hilltop communication have been lit here for centuries. In 1803, around 26 such beacons were erected in the West Riding of Yorkshire, including one on Brimham Beacon. \\"In the year 1887 on the day of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, a great beacon fire was lit here, signalling to others in the distance.\\" =Cup and Ring stone= This cup and ring stone, just west of the SSSI site, is a listed monument. The stone is over three metres long, it has about 21 cups or circular depressions, and some \\"sinuous lines\\" engraved on it. =Noonstone= The Noonstone, known locally as Noon Rock, is a natural rock stack just south-west of the Brimham Rocks SSSI site, and just east of the Adam's Ale spring. It is on a high point, surrounded by trees, overlooking a small farm house or cottage to the north- north-east. Before the trees grew up, the rock used to cast a shadow on the cottage at noon. At least until the end of the 18th century, local people used to light fires next to the Noonstone on Midsummer Eve. =Stone circle= This is the lost stone circle mentioned by Hayman Rooke in 1786, and quoted in literature by other writers since, but apparently never seen by anyone since Rooke. Rooke placed it west of what is now the SSSI site, alongside some tumuli (which were never found either). A \\"Druid's Circle\\" is marked on the 1854 OS six-inch map, a little way north-west of Rock House (now Brimham House) and just west of the trig point. However that position is occupied by natural rock stacks, some of which so happen to lie on a curved or semicircular line.

The company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The firm was known for work in the area of power grid systems and defence electronics. In addition, in 1951 Ferranti began selling an early computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. The Belgian subsidiary lives on as Ferranti Computer Systems and as of 1994 is part of the Nijkerk Holding. History =Beginnings= Ferranti steam generating set, c. 1900 Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti established his first business Ferranti, Thompson and Ince in 1882. The company developed the Ferranti-Thompson Alternator. Ferranti focused on alternating current power distribution early on, and was one of the few UK experts. To avoid confusion, he is often referred to as Dr Ferranti to distinguish him from the Ferranti company itself. In 1885 Dr Ferranti established a new business, with Francis Ince and Charles Sparks as partners, known as S. Z. de Ferranti.Ferranti Timeline ‚Äì Museum of Science and Industry (Accessed 22-02-2012) According to J F Wilson,Ferranti and the British Electrical Industry J F Wilson Dr Ferranti's association with the electricity meter persuaded Ince to partner him in this new venture, and meter development was fundamental to the survival and growth of his business for several decades to come. Despite being a prime exponent of Alternating Current, Ferranti became an important supplier to many electric utility firms and power- distribution companies for both AC and DC meters. In 1887, the London Electric Supply Corporation (LESCo) hired Dr Ferranti for the design of their power station at Deptford. He designed the building, the generating plant and the distribution system and on its completion in October 1890, it was the first truly modern power station. It supplied high-voltage AC power at 10,000 volts, which was transformed to a lower voltage for consumer use where required. Success followed and Ferranti started producing electrical equipment (especially transformers) for sale. Soon the company was looking for considerably more manufacturing space. Land prices in the London area were too high, so the company moved to Hollinwood in Oldham in 1896. In July 1901, Ferranti Limited was formed, specifically to take over the assets of S. Z. de Ferranti Ltd and raise equity, but failed to impress potential new investors as it was still dominated by family ownership. Over-optimistic market projections in the boom of 1896‚Äì1903, declining revenues and liquidity problems, forced the company bankers Parrs to send the company into receivership in 1903. The business was restructured in 1905, Dr Ferranti's shareholding being reduced to less than 10%. For the next eleven years the company was run by receiver managers and Dr Ferranti was effectively excluded from commercial financial strategies. He spent much of this period working in partnership with the likes of J P Coats of Paisley on cotton spinning machinery and Vickers on re-superheating turbines. =Expansion= Ferranti radio Through the early part of the century power was supplied by small companies, typically as an offshoot of plant set up to provide power to local industry. Each plant supplied a different standard, which made the mass production of domestic electrical equipment inefficient. In 1910 Dr Ferranti made a presidential speech to the IEE addressing this issue, but it would be another sixteen years before the commencement of the National Grid in 1926. In 1912, in a move driven by A B Anderson, the Ferranti Managing Director, Ferranti formed a company in Canada, Ferranti Electric, to exploit the overseas meter market. But in 1914 two significant events happened, Anderson drowned on his return from Canada in the Empress of Ireland sinking and the outbreak of WWI signalled an opportunity for Dr Ferranti to once again get involved in day-to-day events in the company. He wanted to get involved in the manufacture of shells and fuzes but it wasn't until 1915 that he finally convinced the board to accept this. As a result of this work Ferranti were in a healthier financial position at the end of the war.Ferranti Packard: Pioneers in Canadian Electrical Manufacturing Norman R Ball, John N Vardalas Ferranti 837 All-Wave Superhet radio (1937), made of alt= High voltage power transformers became an important product for Ferranti; some of the largest types weighed over a hundred tons. Dr Ferranti's son Vincent joined the transformer department as manager in 1921 and was instrumental in expanding the work started by his father. After the death of Dr Ferranti in 1930, he became the chairman and chief executive. In 1935 Ferranti purchased a disused wire drawing mill at Moston: from here it manufactured many \\"brown goods\\" such as televisions, radios, and electric clocks. The company later sold its radio and television interests to EKCO in 1957.Grace Ferranti Instruments, based at Moston, developed various items for scientific measurements, including one of the first cone and plate viscometers. Ferranti built a new power transformer works at Hollinwood in the mid 1950s at a time when there was growth in the power supply distribution industry. By 1974 Ferranti had become an important supplier to the defence industry, but its power transformer division was making losses, creating acute financial problems. This led to the company being bailed out by the government's National Enterprise Board, taking a 65% share of the company in return.Ferranti: A History - Building a Family Business 1882‚Äì1975 J F Wilson =Defence electronics= During World War II, Ferranti became a major supplier of electronics, fuzes, valves, and was, through development of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, heavily involved in the early development of radar in the United Kingdom. In the post- war era this became a large segment of the company, with various branches supplying radar sets, avionics and other military electronics, both in the UK and the various international offices. Spitfire gyro gunsight In 1943 Ferranti opened a factory at Crewe Toll in Edinburgh to manufacture gyro gunsights for the Spitfire aircraft. After the war they set up Ferranti Research to complement this business which grew to employ 8,000 staff in 8 locations, becoming the birthplace of the Scottish electronics industry,Hansard and a major contributor to company profitability. Later products included solid state ring laser gyros. From 1949, Ferranti-Packard assisted the Royal Canadian Navy develop DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving). DATAR was a pioneering computerized battlefield information system that combined radar and sonar information to provide commanders with an \\"overall view\\" of a battlefield, allowing them to coordinate attacks on submarines and aircraft.John Vardalas, \\"From DATAR To The FP-6000 Computer\\", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol 16 No 2, 1994 In the 1950s work focused on the development of airborne radar, with the company subsequently supplying radars to most of the UK's fast jet and helicopter fleets.Ferranti Airpass radar equipment being fitted to a Canberra test aircraft in 1955 Today the Crewe Toll site (now part of Leonardo S.p.A.) leads the consortium providing the Euroradar CAPTOR radar for the Eurofighter Typhoon. In the 1960s and 1970s inertial navigation systems became an important product line for the company with systems designed for fast jet (Harrier, Phantom, Tornado), space and land applications.The Ferranti Inertial Land Surveying System (FILS) as part of an integrated navigation and positioning system The electro-mechanical inertial navigation systems were constructed at the Silverknowes site in Edinburgh. In addition to their other military and civil applications, they were used in the ESA Ariane 4 and first Ariane 5 launches. Ferranti also produced the PADS (Position and Azimuth Determining System), an inertial navigation system which could be mounted in a vehicle and was used by the British Army.The Surveying Handbook by Russell Charles Brinker, Roy Minnick With the invention of the laser in the 1960s the company quickly established itself in the electro- optics arena. From the early 1970s it was delivering the Laser Rangefinder and Marked Target Seeker (LRMTS) for the Jaguar and Harrier fleets, and later for Tornado.Targeting pods It supplied the world's first man-portable laser rangefinder/designator (Laser Target Marker, or LTM) to the British Army in 1974, and had notable successes in the US market, establishing Ferranti Electro-optics Inc in Huntington Beach, California. Its TIALD Pod (Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator) has been in almost constant combat operation on the Tornado since it was rushed into service during the first Gulf War.TIALD: The Gulf War GEC Ferranti From the 1960s through to the late 1980s the Bristol Ferranti Bloodhound SAM, for which Ferranti developed radar systems, was a key money earner. In 1970 Ferranti became involved in the sonar field through its involvement with Plessey in a new series of sonars, for which it designed and built the computer subsystems. This work later expanded when it won a contract for the complete Sonar 2050. The work was originally carried out at the Wythenshawe factory and then at Cheadle Heath. Takeovers of other companies gave it expertise in sonar arrays. This business later became Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems. The selection of the radar for the project that became the Eurofighter Typhoon became a major international issue in the early 1990s. Britain, Italy and Spain supported the Ferranti-led ECR-90, while Germany preferred the MSD2000 (a collaboration between Hughes, AEG and GEC). An agreement was reached after UK Defence Secretary Tom King assured his German counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg that the British government would underwrite the project and allow GEC to acquire Ferranti Defence Systems from its troubled parent. Hughes sued GEC for $600 million for its role in the selection of the EFA and alleged that it used Hughes technology in the ECR-90 when it took over Ferranti. It later dropped this allegation and was awarded $23 million; the court judged that the MSD-2000 \\"had a real or substantial chance of succeeding had GEC not tortuously intervened ... and had the companies, which were bound by the Collaboration Agreement, faithfully and diligently performed their continuing obligations thereunder to press and promote the case for MSD-2000.\\" =Industrial electronics= The company began marketing optical position measuring equipment for machine tools in 1956. Moire fringes produced by diffraction gratings were the basis for the position measurement. In the late 1980s there were several sections of the company involved in non-military areas. These included microwave communications equipment (Ferranti Communications), and petrol (gas) station pumps (Ferranti Autocourt). Both of these departments were based at Dalkeith, Scotland. =Computers= Ferranti Pegasus computer in The Science Museum, London In the late 1940s Ferranti joined with various university-based research groups to develop computers. Their first effort was the Ferranti Mark 1, completed in 1951, about nine delivered between 1951 and 1957. The Pegasus introduced in 1956 was their most popular valve (vacuum tube) system, with 38 units sold. Circa 1956, Ivan Idelson, at Ferranti, originated the Cluff‚ÄìFoster‚ÄìIdelson coding of characters on 7-track paper tape for a BSI committee. (NB. Also has information on the Elliott 503 character set.) This also inspired the development of ASCII. In collaboration with the Victoria University of Manchester they built a new version of the famous Mark 1 that replaced valve diodes with solid state versions, which allowed the speed to be increased dramatically as well as increasing reliability. Ferranti offered the result commercially as the Mercury starting in 1957, and eventually sold nineteen in total. Although a small part of Ferranti's empire, the computer division was nevertheless highly visible and operated out of a former steam locomotive factory in West Gorton. Work on a completely new design, the Atlas, started soon after the delivery of the Mercury, aiming to dramatically improve performance. Ferranti continued their collaboration with the University of Manchester, and Plessey Co., plc, became a third partner. The second generation supercomputer first ran in December 1962. Eventually three machines were built, as well as a derivative version of Atlas that was modified for the needs of the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory; the Titan (or Atlas 2) was the mainstay of scientific computing in Cambridge for nearly 8 years. By the early 1960s their mid-size machines were no longer competitive, but efforts to design a replacement were bogged down. Into this void stepped the Canadian division, Ferranti-Packard, who had used several of the ideas under development in England to very quickly produce the Ferranti-Packard 6000. By this time Ferranti's management had tired of the market and were looking for someone to buy the entire division. Eventually it was merged into International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1963, becoming the Large Systems Division of ICL in 1968. After studying several options, ICT selected the FP 6000 as the basis for their ICT 1900 series line which sold into the 1970s. The deal setting up ICT excluded Ferranti from the commercial sector of computing, but left the industrial field free. Some of the technology of the FP 6000 was later used in its Ferranti Argus range of industrial computers which were developed in its Wythenshawe factory. The first of these, simply Argus, was initially developed for military use. Meanwhile, in Bracknell the Digital Systems Division was developing a range of mainframe computers for naval applications. Early computers using discrete transistors were the Hermes and Poseidon and these were followed by the F1600 in the mid 1960s. Some of these machines remained in active service on naval vessels for many years. The FM1600B was the first of the range to use integrated circuits and was used in many naval and commercial applications. The FM1600D was a single-rack version of the computer for smaller systems. An airborne version of this was also made and used aboard the RAF Nimrod. The FM1600E was a redesigned and updated version of the FM1600B, and the last in the series was the F2420, an upgraded FM1600E with 60% more memory and 3.5 times the processing speed, still in service at sea in 2010. =Semiconductors= Sinclair ZX81 (a.k.a. Timex Sinclair 1000) motherboard Ferranti had been involved in the production of electronic devices, including radio valves, cathode-ray tubes and germanium semiconductors for some time before it became the first European company to produce a silicon diode, in 1955. In 1972 they launched the ZN414, a single- chip AM radio integrated circuit in a 3-pin package. Ferranti Semiconductor Ltd. went on to produce a range of silicon bipolar devices, including, in 1977, the Ferranti F100-L, an early 16-bit microprocessor with 16-bit addressing. An F100-L was carried into space on the amateur radio satellite UoSAT-1 (OSCAR 9). Ferranti's ZTX series bipolar transistors gave their name to the inheritor of Ferranti Semiconductor's discrete semiconductor business, Zetex Semiconductors plc. In the early 1980s, Ferranti produced some of the first large uncommitted logic arrays (ULAs), used in home computers such as the Sinclair ZX81, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro. The microelectronics business was sold to Plessey in 1988. = Acquisition of International Signal and Control = In 1987 Ferranti purchased International Signal and Control (ISC), a United States defence contractor based in Pennsylvania. The company subsequently changed its name to Ferranti International plc. and restructured the combined business into the following divisions: Ferranti Computer Systems, Ferranti Defence Systems, Ferranti Dynamics, Ferranti Satcomms, Ferranti Telecoms, Ferranti Technologies and International Signal and Control. =Collapse= Unknown to Ferranti, ISC's business primarily consisted of illegal arms sales started at the behest of various US clandestine organizations. On paper the company looked to be extremely profitable on sales of high-priced \\"above board\\" items, but these profits were essentially non-existent. With the sale to Ferranti all illegal sales ended immediately, leaving the company with no obvious cash flow. In 1989 the UK's Serious Fraud Office started criminal investigation regarding alleged massive fraud at ISC. In December 1991 James Guerin, founder of ISC and co-Chairman of the merged company, pleaded guilty before the federal court in Philadelphia to fraud committed both in the US and UK. All offences which would have formed part of any UK prosecution were encompassed by the US trial and as such no UK trial proceeded. The financial and legal difficulties that resulted forced Ferranti into bankruptcy in December 1993. Operations De Havilland Heron operated from Manchester Airport 1962‚Äì1970 as an executive transport, particularly between the factories in Lancashire and Scotland. The company name is on the lower fin. The company had factories in Greater Manchester at Hollinwood, Moston, Chadderton (Gem Mill), Waterhead (Cairo Mill), Derker, Wythenshawe, Cheadle Heath, West Gorton, and Poynton. Eventually it set up branch-plants in Edinburgh (Silverknowes, Crewe Toll, Gyle, Granton and Robertson Avenue factories, plus its own hangar facility at Turnhouse Airport), Dalkeith, Aberdeen, Dundee, Kinbuck (near Dunblane), Bracknell, Barrow in Furness and Cwmbran as well as Germany and the United States (inc. Ferranti International Controls Corporation in Sugar Land, Texas) and several British Commonwealth countries including Canada, Australia and Singapore. Ferranti Australia was based in Revesby, Sydney NSW. There was also a primarily defence-related branch office in South Australia. Products manufactured by Ferranti Defence Systems included cockpit displays (moving map, head-down, head-up) video cameras and recorders, gunsight cameras, motion detectors, pilot's night vision goggles, integrated helmets, and pilot's stick controls. On the Tornado aircraft, Ferranti supplied the radar transmitter, inertial navigation system, LRMTS, TIALD pod, mission recording equipment, and cockpit displays. Current ownership of former Ferranti businesses ;Ferranti Autocourt: Acquired by Wayne Dresser, renamed to Wayne Autocourt, before Autocourt name dropped ;Ferranti Communications: Acquired by Thorn and branded Thorn Communications and Telecontrol Systems (CATS). Later acquired by Tyco International and renamed Tyco Communications. Still operating under the name TS Technology Services. ;Ferranti Computer Systems:The Belgian subsidiary lives on as Ferranti Computer System and as of 1994 is part of the Nijkerk HoldingNijkerk Holding History. The remainder was acquired out of administration by SYSECA, the IT arm of Thomson-CSF and renamed Ferranti- SYSECA Ltd.. Later, the Ferranti name was dropped and when Thomson changed its name to Thales Group, SYSECA became Thales Information Systems. Thales Information Systems later sold its German interest to Consinto Gmbh. The department dealing with airport systems was bought by Datel in around 1995 and continued to trade under the name Ferranti Airport SystemsFASL until it was bought by Ultra Electronics. Other parts of Ferranti Computer Systems were acquired out of administration by GEC-Marconi. When GEC-Marconi sold on its defence-related businesses to BAE Systems, many of these former Ferranti entities became part of the BAE/Finmeccanica joint venture called Alenia Marconi Systems. This JV has now been dissolved and the former Ferranti entities are now part of BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies (Insyte). ;Ferranti Defence Systems: Acquired by GEC-Marconi out of administration and renamed GEC Ferranti, later becoming part of GEC Marconi Avionics (GMAv). This business was acquired in 2000 by BAE Systems (BAE Systems Avionics). Part of this business, including the heritage Ferranti operation, was acquired by Finmeccanica in 2007 and renamed SELEX Galileo (now Selex ES). At one time there were design offices at Silverknowes, Robertson Avenue, South Gyle 1 and 2, Crewe Toll, Granton. After BAE Systems was formed the remaining factories at South Gyle were sold off and the staff made redundant despite their ground breaking work on the Avionics and Helmet for EFA and Aircraft Mission Computers. ;Ferranti Dynamics: Acquired by GEC-Marconi in 1992 ;Ferranti Electronics (Ceramic Seals division): Acquired by Ceramic Seals Limited in 1990. ;Ferranti Instrumentation: Dissolved. Some assets acquired by GEC- Marconi and Ravenfield Designs ;Ferranti Tapchangers Ltd: Independent company, then acquired by UK-based grid control specialists Fundamentals Ltd in 2017 ;Ferranti Satcomms: Acquired out of administration by Matra Marconi Space in 1994 ;Ferranti Technologies: Was bought out by management and continues in Oldham specialising in avionics, defence electronics, and electronic power systems. It was acquired by Elbit Systems in 2007. ;Ferranti Air Systems: Acquired by Datel then turned into an independent company. Later bought by Ultra Electronics ;Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems: A 50% share was acquired by GEC-Marconi. Now owned by Thales and renamed Thales Underwater Systems. ;Ferranti Helicopters: Acquired by British Caledonian Airways in April 1979 to become British Caledonian Helicopters which was in turn acquired by Bristow Helicopters in 1987 ;Ferranti Subsea Systems: Management buyout in the early 1990s, renamed FSSL. Kv√¶rner bought more shares in 1994 and then turned to Kv√¶rner FSSL. Kv√¶rner is now known as Aker Solutions ;Ferranti Computer Systems Service Department: This was acquired by the third party maintenance company ServiceTec. The regional Service Centres were rebranded as ServiceTec and all of the service engineers and management were taken on. The support of the Argus computers dominated activities although new (non-Argus) business was added to the regional centres. The repair centre at Cairo Mill also became part of the ServiceTec group, ultimately as a separate entity. ;Ferranti Semiconductors: Became Zetex Semiconductors after a management buyout in 1989. In 2008 it was acquired by Diodes Inc. ;Ferranti Photonics Ltd.: Independent, liquidated after bankruptcy in 2005 Other uses of the Ferranti name A number of uses of the Ferranti name remain in use. In Edinburgh, the Ferranti Edinburgh Recreation Club (FERC), the Ferranti Mountaineering Club and the Ferranti Ten-pin Bowling League are still in existence. While these organisations no longer have any formal ties with the companies which subsumed the Ferranti companies which operated in Edinburgh, they still operate under the old names. Ferranti Thistle F.C. was formed in 1943 and joined the Scottish Football League in 1974. Due to strict sponsorship rules it changed its name to Meadowbank Thistle F.C., and later to Livingston F.C.. Denis Ferranti Meters Limited is still owned by a direct descendant of Sebastian de Ferranti but is not directly related to the major Ferranti corporation. The company has over 200 employees that manufacture BT's public phones, oil pumps for large industrial vehicles, electric motors for motorbility solutions, electronics, and small MOD equipment.

Life Mxenge was born in Tamara Village on 1 January 1942 in King William's Town to parents Wilmot Goso and Nobantu Ntebe. After completing her primary education at Tamara, she went to Forbes Grant Secondary School where she completed the junior certificate (Grade 10). In 1959, she matriculated at Healdtown, Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Province. She trained as a nurse at Victoria Hospital and earned her qualifications in 1964. After she married Griffiths Mxenge, she and her husband moved to Natal (now KwaZulu- Natal). She took midwifery at King Edward Hospital and worked as a community nurse in Umlazi. In 1965, her husband was convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act and was imprisoned for two years on Robben Island. During their marriage, her husband faced various government-sanctioned bans and detentions. She and her husband had two sons, Mbasa and Viwe, and daughter Namhla. Work After completing a midwifery course at King Edward Hospital, Victoria Mxenge worked as a community nurse at Umlazi Clinic. She then studied law through UNISA. In 1981, some five years after her husband had set up a legal practice she acquired legal qualifications, joined the practice and was subsequently admitted as an attorney. On 19 November 1981, her husband was brutally assassinated by Vlakplaas agents led by Dirk Coetzee in Umlazi township, south of Durban. He had multiple stab wounds and his body was found near the soccer field in Umlazi and it fell on her to identify his mutilated body at a government mortuary the morning after his murder. It was claimed by police general Dirk Coetzee that her husband was murdered by the African National Congress (ANC), which she vigorously refuted. The ANC issued a public statement from Lusaka decrying his murder and paying tribute to his contribution in the struggle. In 1996, Dirk Coetzee confessed that he led a group that killed Mxenge. After her husband's murder, Mxenge kept their law practice going. In 1983, she successfully defended students against the confiscation of their results by the Department of Education\\". She also intervened in cases in which the youth were ill-treated while imprisoned. Mxenge represented families of victims of the Matolo raid and Lesotho raid. Mxenge started a bursary fund in memory of her husband. She became a member of the Release Nelson Mandela Committee (RMC), sat on the executive of the National Organisation of Women (NOW) and the Natal Treasurer of the UDF. Mxenge was part of the defence team for the UDF and Natal Indian Congress during the Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial at the Pietermaritzburg Supreme Court . In July 1985, she spoke at the funeral of The Cradock Four, Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlauli. The funeral was attended by over 50 000 mourners. During her speech Mxenge condemned the apartheid government and referred to the murder of The Cradock Four as a \\"dastardly act of cowardices.\\" Death On 1 August 1985, she was \\"gunned down by four black men\\" as she returned from a political meeting. She was killed on her driveway in Umlazi in front of her children. The men were thought to be part of a government 'death squad'. After her death, more than 1,000 students marched in Durban in protest and they were \\"dispersed by police using dogs and clubs.\\" Her funeral which was held on 11 August 1985 in Rayi Village near King William's Townhttps://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetailm.php?nid=22980 was attended by 10,000 people, and letters of condolence were received from Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo amongst others. After her funeral, mourners in Duncan Village took to the streets and vandalised public property. This resulted in clashes between the police and residents which left nine people dead and 138 injured. In 1987, South African magistrates claimed that she had died from \\"head injuries and had been murdered by person unknown\\". The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Report on the assassination of Victoria Mxenge documents that Marvin Sefako (alias Bongi Raymond Malinga) was allegedly recruited by the security branch and that Brigadier Peter Swanepoel was his handler. Malinga confessed that he had killed Mxenge. Legacy In October 2005 the South African Ministry of the Environment launched the third and final s named Victoria Mxenge in her honor. In 2006 both Victoria Mxenge and her husband were posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver for excellent contributions to the field of law and sacrifices made in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. The Victoria Mxenge Group of Advocates was officially established on 1 July 2011 and is part of the Johannesburg Society of Advocates. On 20 August 2017, the KwaZulu-Natal government and eThekwini Municipality unveiled statues in honour of Griffiths and Victoria Mxenge in uMlazi, south of Durban.

The full name of the treaty is Treaty on the delimitation of the frontier for the part not indicated as such in the Peace Treaty of 10 February 1947. The treaty was written in French and became effective on 11 October 1977. For the Italian Government, the treaty was signed by Mariano Rumor, Minister for Foreign Affairs. For Yugoslavia, the treaty was signed by Milo≈° Miniƒá, the Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs.The original text of the Treaty Criticism in Italy The Italian government was criticized harshly for signing the treaty, particularly for the secretive way in which negotiations were carried out, skipping the traditional diplomatic channels. Italian nationalists rejected the idea of giving up Istria, since Istria had been an ancient \\"Italian\\" region together with the Venetian region (Venetia et Histria). Italian nationalists state that the antique Italian eastern border line lies in Istria and is defined as the river Arsia (today Ra≈°a). Furthermore, Istria had belonged to Italy for the 25 (1919‚Äì1943) years between World War I and the end of World War II, and the west coast of Istria had long had a sizeable Italian minority population. Some called for the prosecution of the then Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the crime of treason, as stated in Article 241 of the Italian Criminal Code, which mandates a life sentence for anybody found guilty of aiding and abetting a foreign power to exert its sovereignty on the national territory. The treaty did not guarantee the protection of the Italian minority in the Yugoslav zone nor for the Slovenian minority in the Italian zone. The question of the protection of minorities was to be dealt with later via the signing of separate protocols. Slovenia's and Croatia's independence Slovenia declared its independence in 1991 and was recognized internationally in 1992. Italy was quick to recognise Slovenian independence, and accept the accession of the new Slovenia to treaties concluded with Yugoslavia. Though the treaty's applicability was now in question, Slovenia then released a declaration on 31 July 1992, saying it would recognize the treaty. Both it and Croatia have opposed any changes to the treaty. Slovenia claimed that all debts owing to Italy (for property transferred to Yugoslav sovereignty after 1947) had now been paid. By 1993, however, 35,000 Italians still claimed money was owed to them. In 1994, the Italian government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, demanded that adequate compensation be paid, else efforts to integrate Slovenia into western Europe would be halted. To this effect, it blockaded talks for Slovenia's accession to the European Union until March 1995, when the new government under Lamberto Dini retracted the demand. A co- operative pact was signed (led by Spain), with the effect of allowing Italian nationals who had resided in Slovenia for three years to purchase property there for up to four years after the pact was signed and came into force during Slovenia's attempts to join the EU. No similar declaration was made by the Croatian government, although the Parliament of Croatia on 25 June 1991 accepted the borders of Croatia as part of Yugoslavia. However, Italy did not insist on a declaration by Croatia, and the treaty was never questioned by Croatia, which considers it to be a valid treaty. .

He graduated in 1936 and started to work with Soyuzmultfilm in 1938 as an animator. From 1962 onwards, he worked as a director. His first film The Story of a Crime was an immense success. Today, this film is seen as the beginning of a renaissance of Soviet animation after a two-decade-long life in the shadows of Socialist realism. Diverging from the ‚Äúnaturalistic‚Äù Disney-like canons that were reigning in the 1950-60s in Soviet animated cartoons, he created his own style, which was laconic yet multi- level, non-trivial and vivid. He is the director of outstanding animated short films including such classics as his social satire of bureaucrats, Chelovek v ramke (The Man in the Frame) (1966), the philosophic parable, Ostrov (Island) (1973) about the loneliness of a man in modern society, the biographical film Ein Junger Mann namens Engels - Ein Portrait in Briefen (1970), based on drawings and letters of young Engels, the parody Film, film, film! (1968), and the anti-war film, Lev i byk (The Lion and the Bull) (1984). In April 1993, Khitruk and three other leading animators (Yuri Norstein, Andrey Khrzhanovsky, and Eduard Nazarov) founded SHAR Studio, an animation school and studio in Russia. The Russian Cinema Committee is among the share-holders in the studio. In 2008, he released a two-volume book titled The Profession of Animation (¬´–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏—è ‚Äì –∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç–æ—Ä¬ª). He is the grandfather of violin virtuoso Anastasia Khitruk. Khitruk lived in Moscow, where he died in 2012, aged 95.

Also of note are his albums Rava, L'Opera Va' and Carmen, which are his interpretations of operatic arias and overtures. In 2001, he founded a quintet with pianist Stefano Bollani and toured with Gato Barbieri and Aldo Romano. In the trio Europeans, he worked with Eberhard Weber and Swiss percussionist Reto Weber. In June 2005, Rava was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music at the twentieth anniversary of jazz education at the Umbria Jazz Festival, in Perugia, Italy.

Construction and design Launch of Kaiy≈ç Maru in Dordrecht, 1865 Kaiy≈ç Maru was ordered in 1863, and built by Cornelis Gips and Sons, at Dordrecht, Netherlands, for a sum of 831,200 guilders. Her construction was overseen by a Japanese military mission under Uchida Masao and Akamatsu Noriyoshi. She was launched in October 1866, and arrived in Japan in November of the same year. She was the largest wooden warship ever built by a Dutch shipyard at the time. She was long. Career Part of the fleet of Enomoto Takeaki off Shinagawa in 1868. Kaiy≈ç Maru is second from right. Esashi In January 1868 Kaiy≈ç Maru was engaged in the naval battle of Awa off Awaji Island, where she, Banry≈´ Maru and Hazuru Maru battled against the Satsuma Navy's Kasuga Maru, H≈ç≈ç Maru, and Heiun Maru. During the battle, H≈ç≈ç Maru was sunk off the coast of Awa. In late January 1868, Kaiy≈ç Maru, Kanrin Maru, H≈ç≈ç Maru, and five other modern ships fled to Hokkaido, under Admiral Enomoto Takeaki. They carried a handful of French military advisors, and their leader Jules Brunet. While in Hokkaido, they became a part of the navy of the short-lived Ezo Republic, founded by Enomoto Takeaki. Kaiy≈ç Maru became the flagship of the navy of the Ezo Republic, but she soon was wrecked off Esashi, Hokkaido, Japan, during a storm on 15 November 1868. The steamship Shinsoku made a rescue attempt, but it too sank. Salvage The guns and ship chandlery of Kaiy≈ç Maru were discovered on the seafloor on 14 August 1968 by the submarine Yomiuri-G≈ç (Ë™≠Â£≤Âè∑). Further remains were discovered but project financing prevented the salvage at that time however several items were recovered in 1969. Dives were conducted in August 1974 that confirmed a need for excavation of the extensive remains. Full scale excavation of the wreck from a depth of began in June 1975. The salvage of portions of the wreck located in the open sea were completed in seven years. The inland portions of the wreck were slowed by poor visibility. Costs for the salvage totaled over 3 million yen by 1985. Desalinization of the recovered artifacts began upon recovery. A replica of Kaiy≈ç Maru was constructed in 1990. She is now on display at the docks in Esashi and has become a tourist attraction showing the salvaged remains of the original ship.

The image of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa, also known as Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa, to which miraculous powers are attributed, is one of Jasna G√≥ra's most precious treasures.' The site is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii) and is tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. History The Defence of Jasna G√≥ra 1655 - by January Suchodolski Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa, Poland Jasna G√≥ra Monastery was founded in 1382 by Pauline monks who came from Hungary at the invitation of W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Duke of Opole. The monastery has been a pilgrimage destination for hundreds of years, and it contains an important icon of the Virgin Mary. The icon, depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child, is known as the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa or Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa, which is widely venerated and credited with many miracles.' Among these, it is credited with miraculously saving the Jasna G√≥ra monastery during the Siege of Jasna G√≥ra that took place at the time of The Deluge, a 17th-century Swedish invasion. The event stimulated the Polish resistance. The Poles could not immediately change the course of the war, but, after an alliance with the Crimean Khanate, they repulsed the Swedes. Shortly thereafter, in the cathedral of Lw√≥w (Lviv), on April 1, 1656, Jan Kazimierz, the King of Poland, solemnly pronounced his vow to consecrate the country to the protection of the Mother of God and proclaimed Her the Patron and Queen of the lands in his kingdom. Among the monastery's most important exhibits is the medal from the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize received by Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, the former Polish president and trade-union organizer. Walking pilgrimages Every year since the Middle Ages, thousands of Poles go in pilgrim groups to visit Jasna G√≥ra. In 2011, it was estimated that 3.2 million pilgrims from 80 countries around the world went to the shrine. Around 830,000 pilgrims took part in 228 pilgrimages organized in different places across Poland, 143, 983 of which reached the monastery on foot. The average distance for a pilgrim group to travel is about , made in 11 days. Monastic etiquette There are typically numerous pilgrims and tourists at Jasna G√≥ra Monastery, and the volume of excited voices can be high. However, upon entering the Monastery, it is expected etiquette for visitors to be silent or as quiet as possible out of respect. Often, there is a long line of people who wait to approach the shrine of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa. Upon arriving at the place of the shrine at which one would pass in front of the icon of Our Lady, it is expected and a sign of respect for pilgrims to drop to their knees, and traverse the anterior of the shrine on their knees.

A three-dimensional view of a glider, with previous generations visible going down the z-axis. The c/4 period is clearly visible as \\"stacks\\" of cells that remain alive for successive generations. The glider is a pattern that travels across the board in Conway's Game of Life. It was first discovered by Richard K. Guy in 1970, while John Conway's group was attempting to track the evolution of the R-pentomino. Gliders are the smallest spaceships, and they travel diagonally at a speed of one cell every four generations, or c/4. The glider is often produced from randomly generated starting configurations. John Conway has remarked that he wishes he hadn't called it the glider. The game was developed before the widespread use of interactive computers, and after seeing it animated, he feels the glider looks more like an ant walking across the plane.  Importance  Gliders are important to the Game of Life because they are easily produced, can be collided with each other to form more complicated objects, and can be used to transmit information over long distances. For instance, eight gliders can be positioned so that they collide to form a Gosper glider gun. Fig. 8.12 on p. 129 depicts a closely related synthesis with seven gliders and a block. The 8-glider synthesis combines two of the four-glider units described in this figure. Glider collisions designed to result in certain patterns are also called glider syntheses. Patterns such as blocks, beehives, blinkers, traffic lights, even the uncommon Eater, can be synthesized with just two gliders. It takes three gliders to build the three other basic spaceships, and even the pentadecathlon oscillator. Some patterns require a very large number (sometimes hundreds) of glider collisions; some oscillators, exotic spaceships, puffer trains, guns, etc. Whether the construction of an exotic pattern from gliders can possibly mean it can occur naturally, is still conjecture. Gliders can also be collided with other patterns with interesting results. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in just the right way, the block moves closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block moves farther away. This \\"sliding block memory\\" can be used to simulate a counter, which would be modified by firing gliders at it. It is possible to construct logic gates such as AND, OR and NOT using gliders. One may also build a pattern that acts like a finite state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so, using the glider, the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints: it is Turing complete.  Hacker emblem  Eric S. Raymond has proposed the glider as an emblem to represent the hacker subculture, as the Game of Life appeals to hackers, and the concept of the glider was \\"born at almost the same time as the Internet and Unix\\". The emblem is in use in various places within the subculture, although it is not universally liked.

ActionAid is a federation of 45 country offices that works with communities, often via local partner organisations, on a range of development issues. It was founded in 1972 by Cecil Jackson-Cole as a child sponsorship charity (originally called Action in Distress) when 88 UK supporters sponsored 88 children in India and Kenya, the primary focus being is providing children with an education, further the human rights for all, assisting people that are in poverty, assisting those who face discrimination, and also assist people who face injustice. ActionAid works with over 15 million people in 45 different countries to assist those people. Today its head office is located in South Africa with hubs in Asia, the Americas and Europe. ActionAid was the first big INGO to move its headquarters from the global north to the global south. ActionAid's current strategy aims to \\"build international momentum for social, economic and environmental justice, driven by people living in poverty and exclusion\\".  Tax & economic justice  ActionAid has been campaigning for tax justice since 2008, conducting research into the effects of various international tax treaties and supporting local people and organisations to hold their governments to account. It argues that losing tax revenue to avoidance harms the world's poorest and most marginalised people, who depend on tax-funded public services. It is also often the case that the tax revenue lost in these treaties can exceed the amount of international aid money send to developing countries. In 2011, ActionAid revealed that 98% of the UK's FTSE 100 companies use tax havens. In 2013 its research into corporate tax avoidance in Zambia showed that Associated British Foods were avoiding paying millions of dollars in corporate tax.  Women's rights  ActionAid integrates women's rights into all of its programming and project work, but also undertakes campaigns that focus specifically on these issues. Notable examples have included raising awareness about unpaid care work and sexual harassment and violence (including acid attacks) in Bangladesh, offering free cancer tests to women in Nigeria who could not afford them, and tackling female genital mutilation in Sweden.  Climate justice  ActionAid's advocacy work on climate change focuses on climate justice, guided by the experiences and needs of its country programmes. Its most prominent engagement comes through the annual Conference of Parties, where it supports communities vulnerable to climate change to influence decision-making processes. It calls for rich countries to live up to pledges of providing climate adaptation grants and pushes for agreements to improve the lives of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ActionAid was also critical of climate insurance policies, such as those purchased by Malawi in 2015, since those insurance policies fail to deliver when they are desperately needed.  Emergencies & humanitarian aid  ActionAid promotes women's leadership in humanitarian responses, arguing that women are best positioned to identify their needs and those of the communities around them in times of crisis. Strengthening citizens' rights is also a focus, such as campaigning with Haitians for greater transparency and accountability in how aid money was spent after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. As it has established relationships with communities and other NGOs in countries that are prone to ecological events, ActionAid is often able to respond quickly to emergencies. Notable crises and responses have included the Boxing Day tsunami in 2010 in the Indian ocean, drought in East Africa and India, and floods in Ghana, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh and Nepal. ON 4 OCTOBER 2018 ActionAid announced that Pakistan government has ordered 18 international aid groups to leave the country.  Child sponsorship  Child sponsorship is one of ActionAid's primary sources of income. Donors sponsor an individual child from a community in a developing country and receive regular updates about the child's progress and development. Sponsorship funds support the child's whole community, \\"so children have a healthy and safe place to live and grow up.\\" This support takes the form of providing clean water, healthcare, agricultural programmes, education centres in areas where schools are not available, and community income generation schemes.  Alliance-building  As ActionAid has grown in influence, building alliances with like-minded organisations has become a key focus area. Announcing this approach at the World Social Forum in 2015, ActionAid has played a role in convening civil society and community groups to tackle issues of youth political participation in the Middle East and global inequality. Supporting social causes through the mass media ActionAid made India's first Bollywood film focusing on AIDS, Ek Alag Mausam, a love story involving HIV positive people, based on a script by playwright Mahesh Dattani. ActionAid also supported Shyam Benegal's film, Samar, which is based on the book Unheard Voices: Stories of Forgotten Lives by Harsh Mander. The film raises issues about Dalits.  Criticism  Charity Navigator recorded that in 2012 ActionAid USA had a high cost of fund raising (24%), with 53% of income spent on projects. This was also reported in an International Business Times article in October 2014, which noted that the \\"accounting processes the charity uses resulted in its administrative costs appearing to be 'particularly high' in the fiscal year ending 2012, the timeframe Charity Navigator relied on when calculating its current Charity Navigator score.\\" Charity Navigator reports that for 2013 the cost of fundraising for ActionAid USA was much lower (9.4%), with 82.4% of income spent on projects. ActionAid has been criticized for spreading unsupported claims and \\"grotesque\\" pictures of adverse effects from consumption of some genetically engineered crops in Africa, in particular the unsupported claim of genetically engineered crops causing tumors and cancer. The organization apologized for their misleading actions in 2015, after publication in the media. ActionAid, who had supported coffee growing in 2000 and had earlier openly agitated against the democratically elected Haitian government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is, with a number of other NGOs, strongly criticized for supporting the US-backed coup that removed this, the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 2004, a coup which is described as \\"perhaps the most successful act of imperial sabotage since the end of the Cold War\\".

Originally constructed in 1643 as an aristocratic mansion, it was rebuilt and remodelled several times over the course of its existence by notable architects. The current neoclassical palace was completed in 1818. Throughout its history the palace was a venue for important historical events in Polish, European and world history. In 1791, the facility hosted authors and advocates of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the first modern European constitution. In 1818, the palace began its ongoing career as a governmental structure, when it became the seat of the Viceroy (namiestnik) of Congress Poland. Following Poland's resurrection after World War I, in 1918, the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities and became the seat of the Council of Ministers. During World War II, it served the country's German occupiers as a Deutsches Haus and survived intact the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. After the war, it resumed its function as seat of the Polish Council of Ministers. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed inside the Presidential Palace between the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries. Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland. History Construction of the present- day Presidential Palace in Warsaw was begun in 1643 by Crown Great Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, owner of the town of Brody (80 km. east of Lw√≥w) and of numerous latifundia situated in Poland's eastern borderlands; hence the palace's first name was \\"Pa≈Çac Koniecpolskich\\"‚Äîthe \\"Koniecpolski Palace\\". It was said that he owned so much landed property that he could cross the breadth of the Commonwealth while spending every night in one of his own manors. The palace was not completed in the Hetman's lifetime, as he died unexpectedly in 1646 at his Brody residence, a few weeks after taking a young wife. Deluge The palace's architect was Constantino Tencalla, architect to Poland's King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and designer of Sigismund's Column, in front of the nearby Royal Castle, commemorating Sigismund III of Poland. The palace was completed by Koniecpolski's son Aleksander in the style of a baroque residence, imitating those of northern Italy and Genoa. A view of the palace in a Warsaw panorama of 1656The Eagle and Three Crowns by Erik Dahlberg confirms this. The next owner of the palace was Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski‚ÄîGrand Crown Hetman and Crown Chancellor, and later the leader of a rebellion against the king‚Äîwho bought the palace from Aleksander Koniecpolski. In 1674 the palace became, for the next 144 years, the property of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. It was bought from descendants of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski ‚Äî Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirski and Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski ‚Äî by Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç of the Nie≈õwie≈º‚ÄìO≈Çyka line, whose wife Katarzyna was a sister of King Jan III Sobieski. After her death, her son Karol Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç I began renovation of the palace and tidied up its surroundings. He entrusted this task to the king's architect, Augustyn Locci. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Palace in 1762 The next-to-last heir in tail of Nie≈õwie≈º and O≈Çyka was Karol Stanis≈Çaw \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Voivode of Vilnius, son of Micha≈Ç Kazimierz \\"Rybe≈Ñko\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. He had inherited huge estates from his father and uncle which made him the wealthiest magnate in Poland in the second half of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. He leased out the palace to Franciszek Ryx to house a theater which staged plays and threw masked balls. During the Four-Year Sejm of 1788-1792, he invited all the members of the four deliberating estates to dine there daily. Two meals were served every day: breakfast before the day's session, for 300 people, and dinner after the session. One of the most impressive feasts given by him was on St. Catherine's Day, November 25, 1789, the 25th anniversary of King Stanis≈Çaw August's coronation, and commemorating the Union of Lithuania with the Polish Crown. Four thousand guests were invited, and the feast cost over 2 million z≈Çotys. Carmelite Church and Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Palace (right) in 1780, painting by Bernardo Bellotto On the night of May 2‚Äî3, 1791, a conspiratorial group of members of the Four-Year Sejm who were bent on saving the Commonwealth met at the palace to strategize means to secure the adoption, next day, of the May 3rd Constitution. This document is called \\"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\\" by historian Norman Davies. Karol Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç II died a sick and blind man at age 56. His property was inherited by Dominik, son of his half-brother Hieronim. Dominik, who had been wounded at the Battle of Hanau, died heirless on November 11, 1813. The line of the Nie≈õwie≈º‚ÄìO≈Çyka heirs in tail died out with him. In 1818 the palace became the seat of the Viceroy of the Polish (Congress) Kingdom (when it acquired the name 'Pa≈Çac Namiestnikowski' - the Palace of Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland). The first Viceroy, from 1815, was J√≥zef ZajƒÖczek (1752‚Äì1820), former aide-de-champ to Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, deputy to the Four-year Sejm, secretary of the Friends of the Constitution (i.e., of the May 3rd Constitution), a division commander during the Polish-Russian War of 1792, hero of the Battle of Ziele≈Ñce, a Polish Jacobin, a soldier in Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski's legions, a general of Napoleon's. At the last he adopted a servile attitude toward Alexander I, King of Poland and Tsar of Russia, who created him a duke in 1818. ZajƒÖczek had lost a leg at the Berezina River and was carried about by his valets in an armchair. Grand staircase Beginning in 1818 the palace was rebuilt in classicist style by the architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner (1756‚Äì1841). He extended the palace (its lower wings reached the line of buildings on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie), placed a new grand staircase between the main body of the building and its northern wing, remodeled the palace facades, and redecorated the rooms on the first and second floors of the main body of the building. Because of its massive vaulting, the ground floor remained unchanged. Aigner had two associates: Camillo Landini, who sculpted the four stone lions guarding the palace courtyard on the Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie side, and Miko≈Çaj Monti, an Italian painter. The main body of the building was remodeled to the Corinthian order and ornamented with columns, pilasters, balustrade and stone statues. Aigner is inseparably linked with the Viceregal (Polish: Namiestnikowski) ‚Äî today, Presidential‚ÄîPalace as the creator of its classicist exterior, which survives unchanged to this day. The year 1852 brought disaster to the palace. A fire burned the main body of the building almost to the ground. Only charred walls remained. Reconstruction was entrusted to Alfons Kropiwnicki (1803‚Äì1881). The reconstruction of the palace was completed in 1856. The palace obtained the same architectural exterior as before the fire, but the interior was enriched with new decorative elements. The author of the room decorations was Boles≈Çaw Podczaszy≈Ñski. Viceregal Palace, with statue of Ivan Paskevich, before 1900 In the rebuilt palace, gatherings of the Agricultural Society were held, and balls were organized when the tsars visited Poland. In 1870, a statue of Ivan Paskevich was unveiled there. In 1879, in the palace's colonnade hall, the inhabitants of Warsaw for the first time saw \\"The Battle of Grunwald\\", a historical painting by Jan Matejko. At the turn of the 20th century, the Tarnowski Palace to the right (south) of the building was pulled down, and in 1899-1901 the luxurious Hotel Bristol was built in its place, designed by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Marconi. One of the shareholders in the consortium that built the hotel was the famous pianist and post-World War I Polish prime minister, Ignacy Paderewski. In 1918 the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities, and renovation of the palace was entrusted to Marian Lalewicz. The building became the official seat of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (the Prime Minister) and of the Council of Ministers itself. The side wings housed the chancellery offices of the Council of Ministers. As restored by Lalewicz, the building was greatly admired by Warsaw's inhabitants and visitors. Germany's Hermann G√∂ring, when in February 1937 calling there on Prime Minister General Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski, took such a keen interest in the palace that he arrived late to his meeting with Polish Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck. Equestrian statue of Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski In 1939 the palace suffered minimal damage. In 1941-1942 it was radically reconstructed into a Deutsches Haus by the Polish architects Janusz Nagorski and Jan Lukasik. In the course of the work, rococo ornamentation in the rooms overlooking the garden was renovated with great care. A couple of grisaille paintings were uncovered on the staircase, featuring eagle and weapon motifs. The Germans wanted to remove the eagles as Polish national emblems, but allowed them to remain after it was explained that these were Napoleonic eagles, a favorite motif of the French Empire period. On the ground floor of the right wing, a restaurant was put in, with wooden beam ceiling and a spacious cloakroom. The palace survived the Warsaw Uprising intact. After Warsaw's liberation, the palace was thoroughly reconstructed by Antoni Brusche and Antoni Jawornicki. In 1965 Bertel Thorvaldsen's classicist equestrian statue of Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski, which previously had stood before the now destroyed Polish General Staff building (the \\"Saxon Palace\\") on nearby Pi≈Çsudski Square (once known as \\"Saxon Square\\"), was relocated to the courtyard before the \\"Viceroy's Palace.\\" After World War II, the palace again served as the seat of the Council of Ministers until the latter moved to its current seat at the Chancellery on Ujazd√≥w Avenue. Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland replacing the smaller Belweder palace. However, President Bronislaw Komorowski decided to move the residence back to Belweder, purportedly in honor of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and the early presidents of Poland, but the move was understood as an attempt to avoid confrontations with mourners of the late President, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, who was killed in an April 2010 air crash at Smolensk, Russia.

When land development and speculation in the region became frenzied and detached from economic reality, the Mississippi bubble became one of the earliest examples of an economic bubble. History =Banque Royale= John Senex's map (1721), with a dedication to William Law, probably a relative of John Law (possibly his brother), who bore much of the blame for the financial panic known as the \\"Mississippi Bubble\\". In May 1716, the Scottish economist John Law, who had been appointed Controller General of Finances of France under the Duke of Orleans, created the Banque G√©n√©rale Priv√©e (\\"General Private Bank\\"). It was the first financial institution to develop the use of paper money.Backhosue, Roger. Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas, Transaction Publishers, 1994, , p. 118http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the- mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html NY Federal Reserve: Mississippi Bubble of 1720 It was a private bank, but three quarters of the capital consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes. In August 1717, Law bought the Mississippi Company to help the French colony in Louisiana. In the same year Law conceived a joint-stock trading company called the Compagnie d'Occident (The Mississippi Company, or, literally, \\"Company of [the] West\\"). Law was named the Chief Director of this new company, which was granted a trade monopoly of the West Indies and North America by the French government.Bammer, Stuart. Anglo-American Securities Regulation: Cultural and Political Roots, 1690‚Äì1860, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , p. 42 The bank became the Banque Royale (Royal Bank) in 1718, meaning the notes were guaranteed by the king, Louis XV of France. The company absorbed the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (\\"Company of the East Indies\\"), the Compagnie de Chine (\\"Company of China\\"), and other rival trading companies and became the Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes on 23 May 1719 with a monopoly of French commerce on all the seas. Simultaneously, the bank began issuing more notes than it could represent in coinage; this led to a currency devaluation, which was eventually followed by a bank run when the value of the new paper currency was halved.Sheeran, Paul and Spain, Amber. The international political economy of investment bubbles, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, , p. 95 Representation of the very famous island of Mad-head, lying in the sea of shares, discovered by Mr. Law-rens, and inhabited by a collection of all kinds of people, to whom are given the general name shareholders, 1720. =Mississippi Bubble= Louis XIV's long reign and wars had nearly bankrupted the French monarchy. Rather than reduce spending, the Regency of Louis XV of France endorsed the monetary theories of Scottish financier John Law. In 1716, Law was given a charter for the Banque Royale under which the national debt was assigned to the bank in return for extraordinary privileges. The key to the Banque Royale agreement was that the national debt would be paid from revenues derived from opening the Mississippi Valley. The Bank was tied to other ventures of Law‚Äîthe Company of the West and the Companies of the Indies. All were known as the Mississippi Company. The Mississippi Company had a monopoly on trade and mineral wealth. The Company boomed on paper. Law was given the title Duc d'Arkansas. Bernard de la Harpe and his party left New Orleans in 1719 to explore the Red River. In 1721, he explored the Arkansas River. At the Yazoo settlements in Mississippi he was joined by Jean Benjamin who became the scientist for the expedition. In 1718, there were only 700 Europeans in Louisiana. The Mississippi Company arranged ships to move 800 more, who landed in Louisiana in 1718, doubling the European population. Law encouraged some German-speaking peoples, including Alsatians and Swiss, to emigrate. They give their name to the regions of the C√¥te des Allemands and the Lac des Allemands in Louisiana. Prisoners were set free in Paris from September 1719 onwards, under the condition that they marry prostitutes and go with them to Louisiana. The newly married couples were chained together and taken to the port of embarkation. In May 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners about this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibited such deportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721. Cat Island: The History of a Mississippi Gulf Coast Barrier Island, by John Cuevas Law exaggerated the wealth of Louisiana with an effective marketing scheme, which led to wild speculation on the shares of the company in 1719. The scheme promised success for the Mississippi Company by combining investor fervor and the wealth of its Louisiana prospects into a sustainable, joint-stock, trading company. The popularity of company shares were such that they sparked a need for more paper bank notes, and when shares generated profits the investors were paid out in paper bank notes.Beattie, Andrew. \\"What burst the Mississippi Bubble?\\" on Investopedia.com (June 17, 2009) In 1720, the bank and company were merged and Law was appointed by Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, then Regent for Louis XV, to be Comptroller General of FinancesMckay, Charles. Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. New York: Noonday Press, 1932, p.25. First edition published 1841, second edition 1852 to attract capital. Law's pioneering note-issuing bank thrived until the French government was forced to admit that the number of paper notes being issued by the Banque Royale exceeded the value of the amount of metal coinage it held. The \\"bubble\\" burst at the end of 1720, when opponents of the financier attempted to convert their notes into specie (gold and silver) en masse, forcing the bank to stop payment on its paper notes.Davies, Roy and Davies, Glyn. \\"A Comparative Chronology of Money: Monetary History from Ancient Times to the Present Day: 1700‚Äì1749\\" (1996 and 1999) By the end of 1720 Philippe d'Orl√©ans had dismissed Law from his positions. Law then fled France for Brussels, eventually moving on to Venice, where he lived off his gambling. He was buried in the church San Mois√® in Venice.

Suakin used to be considered the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea, but the old city built of coral is now in ruins. In 1983 it had a population of 18,030 and the 2009 estimate is 43,337. Ferries run daily from Suakin to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Etymology Sawakin () is Arabic, meaning \\"dwellers\\" or \\"stillnesses.\\" The Beja name for Suakin was U Suk, possibly from the Arabic word suq, meaning market. In Beja, the locative case for this is isukib, whence Suakin might have derived.Berg, Robert: Suakin: Time and Tide . Saudi Aramco World. The spelling on Admiralty charts in the late 19th century was \\"Sauakin\\" but in the popular press \\"Suakim\\" was predominant. History =Ancient= Suakin was likely Ptolemy's Port of Good Hope, Limen Evangelis, which is similarly described as lying on a circular island at the end of a long inlet. Under the Ptolemies and Romans, though, the Red Sea's major port was Berenice to the north. The growth of the Muslim caliphate then shifted trade first to the Hijaz and then the Persian Gulf. =Medieval= The collapse of the Abbasids and growth of Fatimid Egypt changed this and Al-Qusayr and Aydhab became important emporia, trading with India and ferrying African pilgrims to Mecca. Suakin was first mentioned by name in the 10th century by al-Hamdani, who says it was already an ancient town. At that time, Suakin was a small Beja settlement, but it began to expand after the abandonment of the port of Badi to its south. The Crusades and Mongol invasions drove more trade into the region: there are a number of references to Venetian merchants residing at Suakin and Massawa as early as the 14th century. right One of Suakin's rulers, Ala al-Din al- Asba'ani, angered the Mamluk sultan Baybars by seizing the goods of merchants who died at sea nearby. In 1264, the governor of Qus and his general Ikhmin Ala al-Din attacked with the support of Aydhab. Al-Asba'ani was forced to flee the city. The continuing enmity between the two towns is testified to by reports that after the destruction of Aydhab by Sultan Barsbay in 1426, the refugees who fled to Suakin instead of Dongola were all slaughtered.Dahl, Gudrun & al: \\"Precolonial Beja: A Periphery at the Crossroads.\\" Nordic Journal of African Studies 15(4): 473‚Äì498 (2006). The Beja were originally Christian. Despite the town's formal submission to the Mamluks in 1317, O. G. S. Crawford believed that the city remained a center of Christianity into the 13th century. Muslim immigrants such as the Banu Kanz gradually transformed this: ibn Battuta records that in 1332 there was a Muslim \\"sultan\\" of Suakin, al- Sharif Zaid ibn-Abi Numayy ibn-'Ajlan, who was the son of a Meccan sharif. Following the region's inheritance laws, he had inherited the local leadership from his Bejan maternal uncles. Drawing of Suakin in Dom_Jo√£o_de_Castro_- _Roteiro_do_Mar_Roxo_1541-(Suaquem) In the fifteenth century, Suakin was briefly part of the Adal Sultanate. = Portuguese = Portuguese in the Red Sea in the 16th & 17th century campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. Suakin Island in Sudan was for the Mamluks from Egypt and Syria a very important port, in the west coast of the Red Sea. Nevertheless from the 15th century on the Portuguese with their superior naval power, gained dominance in the region, attacking and making alliances with Muslim reigns of Africa and Middle east, leading to the capture of Suakin in 1513 by the Portuguese . The Ottoman Empire, to avoid more attacks from the Portuguese in Egypt , made an effort to establish control of the Red Sea by controlling the port during the reign of Sultan Selim I. =Ottoman= Suakin in 1928 In 1517, the Ottoman sultan Selim I added the port to the territory of the Ottoman Empire, and after a brief occupation by the Funj, it was thereafter the residence of the pasha of the Ottoman province of Habesh. The Ottomans restored the two main mosques - Shafii and Hanafi, strengthened the walls of the fort and built new roads and buildings.Why is Sudan's Suakin island important for Turkey?Turks return to Suakin Island after two centuriesTurkey renovating historic Ottoman-era sites on Suakin island in Sudan As the Portuguese explorers discovered and perfected the sea route around Africa and the Ottomans were unable to stop this trade, the local merchants began to abandon the town. Some trade was kept up with the Sultanate of Sennar, but by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found two-thirds of the homes in ruin. The Khedive Isma'il received Suakin from the Ottomans in 1865 and attempted to revitalize it: Egypt built new houses, mills, mosques, hospitals, even a church for immigrant Copts. =British and colonial rule= The British Army was involved at Suakin in 1883‚Äì1885 and Lord Kitchener was there in this period leading the Egyptian Army contingent. Suakin was his headquarters and his force survived a lengthy siege there. The Australian colonial forces of Victoria offered their torpedo boat HMVS Childers, and gunboats HMVS Victoria and HMVS Albert, which arrived in Suakin on 19 March 1884 on their delivery voyage from Britain, only to be released as fighting had moved inland. They departed on 23 March, arriving in Melbourne on 25 June 1884. An essentially civilian military force of 770 men from New South Wales, including some of the Naval Brigade, arrived in Suakin in March 1885 and served until mid-May.Before the Anzac Dawn: A military history of Australia before 1915 Chapter 5: \\"Australian naval defence\\", Edited: Craig Stockings, John Connor (2013), accessed 23 June 2016 After the Mahdi's defeat, the British preferred to develop the new Port Sudan rather than engage in the extensive rebuilding and expansion that would be necessary to make Suakin comparable. By 1922, the last of the British had left. =Modern= On January 17, 2018, as part of a rapprochement with Sudan, Turkey was granted a 99-year lease over Suakin. Turkey will rebuild a ruined Ottoman port city on Sudan's Red Sea. Buildings of Suakin A detailed description of the buildings of Suakin, including measured plans and detailed sketches, can be found in The Coral Buildings of Suakin: Islamic Architecture, Planning, Design and Domestic Arrangements in a Red Sea Port by Jeanne-Pierre Greenlaw, Kegan Paul International, 1995, .

The Tugen are a sub tribe of the Kalenjin people alongside the Nandi, Kipsigis, Keiyo, Pokot, Marakwet, Sabaot, Ogiek, Lembus and Sengwer sub-tribes. They occupy Baringo County and some parts of Nakuru County and Elgeyo Marakwet County in the former Rift Valley Province, Kenya. Daniel arap Moi, the second president of Kenya (1978‚Äì2002), came from the Tugen sub-tribe. The Tugen people speak the Tugen language. The Tugen population was 197,556 in 2019.  History  Unlike other Kalenjin sub tribes, Tugen is more diverse in culture and language. Aror and Samor follows Tugen circumcision rites. In terms of language, Aror is more isolated. They have strong connection with Marakwet people. = Origins = The oral traditions of the Tugen indicate three areas of origin located north, west and east of the present Tugen homelands. The bulk of the population originated from the west, from a place known as Sumo which is located between Mount Elgon and Cherangany Hills. The northern and eastern migrations came from Suguta (Lake Turkana) and Koilegen (Mount Kenya) and brought with them non-Kalenjin speaking people from northern Kenya and the highlands to the East of the Rift Valley respectivelyKandagor, D.

This is the group from which the second president of Kenya, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi comes.{{Cite webtitle=Tugen peopleurl=https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/tugen- people/m048b4twebsite=Google Arts & Culturelanguage=enaccess. * Endorois who come from the Marigat and Mogotio Districts.</ref.  Culture  = Religion = Traditionally, like other Kalenjin people, the Tugen prayed to a God called Asis (which means 'sun'.) There are also gods namely Chepapkoyo(god of harvest), Cheptengeryan (god of love). Most have converted to Christianity. Islam has flourished in the major towns and it was these towns that some Tugens convert into Islam and adopted Islamic names. = Age-sets = The Tugen social organisation centres on the age set, or ibindo. There are seven age-sets (ibinwek) which are rotational, meaning at the end of one ageset new members of that generation are born. The order is roughly as given below. Among the some Kalenjin peoples, an age-set called Maina exists. However, among the Tugen, this ageset is extinct. Legend has it that the members of this ibindo were wiped out by the Keiyo, in skirmish between the two tribes near present day Cheploch gorge.

It was built as a town for workers engaged in the construction of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. Russian is the first language of the vast majority of the town population. Originally the aerial view of Visaginas was designed to resemble a butterfly. However, after work on the nuclear power plant was cancelled, so was further construction of the town. Currently Visaginas consists of three residential regions that locals refer to as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Microdistricts. Visaginas has 14 streets. The city grew up in a pine forest by Lake Visaginas. Tourism is currently an area of great potential, as is the possibility of a new nuclear power plant. The administrative centre of Visaginas municipality is situated near the country's biggest lake, Dr≈´k≈°iai. Its administrative boundaries are in the process of being defined. The Vilnius‚ÄìDaugavpils railway runs alongside the town, providing convenient communication with those cities. Motorways connect the town with all other cities in the republic. History In the distant past, the surroundings of Visaginas were inhabited by the Selonians. Historical annals first mention the location in 1526, when it was presented by the nobleman Vaitiekus Go≈°tautas to the Naujasis (New) Daugƒóli≈°kis parish. In the 14th‚Äì19th centuries the region was invaded by the Livonian, Swedish, Russian and French troops. Before World War II, from 1922 to 1939, the area of modern Visaginas lay within the boundaries of the Gmina Smo≈Çwy in the Bras≈Çaw County of the Wilno Voivodeship in Poland. Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Geiger counter The settlement was founded in 1975 as Snieƒçkus, a town for workers at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant on the shores of Lake Visaginas. It was established in place of four villages that were demolished, the largest of which was known as Visaginas. The new town was named after Antanas Snieƒçkus, a former first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party. In 1977 it was granted the status of an urban-type settlement, and received municipal rights in 1995. Brief history of the Visaginas municipality visaginas.lt Visaginas municipality lrvalstybe.lt It is governed by a town council, which elects the mayor. In 1996, the city's coat of arms was confirmed by a decree of the President of the Republic. The settlement was developed in complexes, with construction designed to create an infrastructure for the cultural and everyday life of the residents. Efforts were made to preserve the natural surroundings as much as possible. Population In 1996, the population was 33,100, of which 55.68% were Russians, 15.88% Lithuanians, 10.29% Belarusians, 9.13% Poles, 5.69% Ukrainians and 0.95% Tatars. Orthodox Christians made up 40.42% of the total population, Roman Catholics 27.29%, the Non-affiliated 27.29%, Old Believers 2.89% and Muslims 0.46%. In 2001, the population was 52.43% Russian, 14.96% Lithuanian and 32.61% other.Rasa Baloƒçkaitƒó. \\" Post- Soviet Transitions of the Planned Socialist Towns: Visaginas, Lithuania.\\" Studies of Transition States and Societies.

This creates a distinctive cultural ambiance in the town. Industry Power was the main branch of industry: the country's only nuclear power plant, one of the world's most powerful, is situated near Visaginas. It ceased operations in December 2009 over safety concerns and is currently being decommissioned. Over 5,000 people were employed in the plant. There are opportunities to developing the construction industry in order to utilize the existing industrial potential (concrete, ferroconcrete, and wood), and also the electronics industry, polish and paint, and clothing. There are over 1,500 companies in the town active in light industry, trade and services. Education, culture, and sports The town has a polytechnic school, six secondary schools, an elementary school, eight nursery schools, music and acrobatics colleges, a sports centre and other institutions engaged in organizing educational and leisure activities, including 11 sports clubs with more than 1,600 members.

He was the 4th son of King Wideok.Baekje Bon-gi 5, Samguk Yusa.as written in the Samguk Sagi say the translators of Il-yeon's: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 124. Silk Pagoda (2006).  Background  During his reign, the Three Kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) were at war with each other, as alliances shifted and the neighboring China also experienced a change of dynasties. Because reliable historical sources are hard to find for the Three Kingdoms period, the specifics of Mu's policies are not known.  Reign  Early in his reign, Mu attacked Silla several times. He also requested assistance from Sui dynasty of China to attack Goguryeo. Following the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War, the Sui was replaced by the Tang dynasty in China in 618. In 627, he attempted to recover land lost to Silla, but stopped when Tang intervened diplomatically. The same year, he sent the Buddhist monk Gwalleuk to Japan with texts on Buddhism, astronomy, history, and geography. He formally established the Mireuksa temple in 602. He is also said to have ordered the repair of Baekje's Sabi Palace in 630, and the construction near his palace of the earliest known artificial lake in Korea.ÎÑ§Ïù¥Î≤Ñ Î∞±Í≥ºÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ His policies in the latter half of his reign, which emphasized construction projects at the expense of national defence, are often thought to have contributed to the fall of Baekje which took place twenty years after his death. There is reason to believe that he moved the capital of Baekje from Sabi in Buyeo County to Iksan, at least briefly. Archaeological evidence in Iksan, including tombs attributed to Mu and his wife Queen Seonhwa, appears to confirm this.http://www.ocp.go.kr:8091/visit/english/theme/theme06_3.html Mu retained close ties with Tang China, but Tang later allied with Silla in the wars that ultimately unified the Korean Peninsula under Silla's rule by 668. Seodong- yo The Samguk Yusa relates a legend regarding Mu's marriage to a princess of Silla, although historians consider it unlikely to be true, given the hostilities between the rival kingdoms. In this story, the young Seodong (Mu's childhood name) falls in love with Silla princess Seonhwa, and intentionally spreads a song about the princess and himself among the people.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 122f. Silk Pagoda (2006).

Oulton Broad Oulton Broad, September 1995. From the Commodore Road edge Oulton Broad is an expanse of water and marsh which forms part of the network of man-made bodies of water known as The Broads. It is believed to be the remnant of medieval peat cutting. To the east it is linked by Mutford Lock to the saltwater Lake Lothing which passes through the centre of Lowestoft and opens into the North Sea. To the west it is linked by Oulton Dyke to the River Waveney. The Broad is the most southern area of open water in the Broads system, and is a busy tourist and sporting centre. It is used for a variety of watersports, including powerboat racing, and as the base for boat hire. Facilities include a yacht station and moorings as well as a 'village' of holiday chalets. Nicholas Everitt Park has an extensive water frontage. It is one of the few broads with residential areas adjacent, with houses to the north and flats to the east. The north side of the Broad is one of the most expensive residential areas in Lowestoft, with large detached houses having lake frontage. While the eastern and north shores of the Broad are built up, the west and south-west are quiet and natural. This part of the lake can be reached on foot by walking through Nicholas Everitt Park and then by public footpaths and field across White Cast Marshes, an important nature conservation area. A civil parish was created in the 1 April 2017. Oulton Broad village Oulton Broad was once a village separate from Lowestoft. Oulton Broad and Oulton Village were conurbated around the late 1950s with the building of the Rock estate. The original Oulton village covered all that land between the site of Oulton Broad South Railway station and the odd number side of what is now Sands Lane with the line of the Lowestoft-Ipswich railway separating Oulton as a whole from Kirkley and Lowestoft. Oulton Village was a somewhat smaller and largely amorphous village extending from the even number side of Sands Lane out across the fields to Somerleyton. The Oulton Broad conurbation eventually merged with Lowestoft with the development in the early 1990s of the new through-road system around Peto way on the north-east side of the village, which brought with it major development of what had remained until then very light residential and grassland. There is now no discernible boundary between Oulton Broad and Lowestoft, save for the presence of the two railway lines. Bridge Road is Oulton Broad's main shopping street. Oulton Broad is served by two railway stations; Oulton Broad North on the Lowestoft- Norwich line, and Oulton Broad South on the Lowestoft-Ipswich line. =Nicholas Everitt Park= Nicholas Everitt Park fronts Oulton Broad. Lowestoft Museum in the park was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It houses one of the world's largest collections of Lowestoft porcelain. The Waveney and Oulton Broad Yacht Club is also located in Nicholas Everitt Park. =George Borrow= After marrying in 1840 the writer, traveller, and walker George Borrow moved to his wife's estate in Oulton Broad. In between travels he wrote several books there. During the 1850s he moved away, but returned to Oulton Broad in 1874 where he stayed until his death in 1881. A hotel in the area was named after him, and now houses Hayden Chemists Head Office. =General Alderson= Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson, a keen yachtsman and canoeist, lived in his last years on a houseboat moored at Oulton Broad, called \\"Fox\\", up until the month before his death in 1927.

According to tradition, Domnall M√≥r Ua Briain, the last King of Munster, founded the present cathedral on the site of his palace on King's Island in 1168.Talbot, Very Rev. Maurice. Monuments of St. Mary's Cathedral. Print. The palace had been built on the site of the Viking meeting place, or \\"Thingmote\\" ‚Äì the Vikings' most westerly European stronghold.

History of the Cathedral of St. Mary's Limerick. The west door is now only used on ceremonial occasions. The bishops of Limerick have for centuries knocked on this door and entered by it as part of their installation ceremony. According to tradition, during the many sieges of Limerick the defenders of the city used the stones around the west door to sharpen their swords and arrows, and the marks they made in the stonework can be seen there today. The tower of Saint Mary's Cathedral was added in the 14th century. It rises to 120 feet (36.58 meters), containing a peal of 8 bells, of which 6 were cast by John Taylor & Co, Loughborough, and 2 cast in Whitechapel, London. The tower also contains a stationary service bell, which can be rung from the ground floor. Notable burials File:Charles Graves (bishop).jpgBishop Charles Graves The cathedral graveyard contains many graves and tombs of notable people. The physician Samuel Crumpe is buried in the graveyard near the great west door. Prince Milo of Montenegro, Frances Condell (first woman Mayor of Limerick) and Bishop Charles Graves are also interred in the grounds. The last High King of Munster, Domnall was purportedly buried in the cathedral, with the remnants of his stone coffin still visible in the Cathedral chancel. Bishop Cornelius O'Dea is buried alongside several other Bishops of Limerick in what is believed to be an Episcopal vault underneath the chancel itself. Also notable are the Sexton, Barrington, Boyd and Vanderkiste tombs along the south entrance pathway. From the Irish Reformation to the 19th century Altar of the cathedral There are five chandeliers which hang from the ceiling. These are only lit on special occasions. The larger three of the five were made in Dublin and presented in 1759 by the Limerick Corporation. The belfry holds a peal of eight bells, six of which were presented by William Yorke, mayor of Limerick, in 1673. An active team of bell ringers travels the country to compete with other campanologists. Saint Mary's received its organ in 1624, when Bishop Bernard Adams donated one. It has been rebuilt over the centuries and was most recently renovated in 1968 and 2005. In 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote a flattering description of the cathedral: \\"not large, but lightsome, and by the providence of the Bishop fairly beautified within, and as gloriously served with singing and organs\\".Gernon, Luke A Discourse of Ireland 1620 edited by C.L. Falkiner 1904 During the Irish Confederacy wars, the cathedral was briefly transferred to Roman Catholic hands. The bishop of Limerick, Richard Arthur, was buried in the cathedral in 1646.Choir misericordsIn 1651, after Oliver Cromwell's forces captured Limerick, the cathedral was used as a stable by the parliamentary army. This misuse was short lived, but was a similar fate to that suffered by some of the other great cathedrals during the Cromwellian campaign in Ireland. The troops also removed the cathedral's original 13 ft Pre-Reformation high altar from the cathedral. The altar was only reinstated in the 1960s. It is the largest such altar in Ireland and the UK, carved from a single limestone block. The altar is used for communion services at major festivals and remains in its historic location in what is now the chapel of the Virgin Mary or Lady Chapel. In 1691, the cathedral suffered considerable damage, particularly on the east end, during the Williamite Siege of Limerick.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p153: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 After the Treaty of Limerick, William granted ¬£1,000 towards repairs.

In 1991, there was a large ¬£2.5 million restoration programme which was completed in 1996 with the excavation and re-laying of the floors as well as the installation of underfloor central heating. Restoration continues today to a lesser degree. From the 20th century to the 21st century Today the cathedral is still used for its original purpose as a place of worship and prayer for everybody. It is also the 3rd biggest tourist attraction in Limerick. It is open to the public every day from 9:00 am to 4:45 pm. For Tourists there is a ‚Ç¨5 admission charge upon entry. This money is essential for the upkeep of the building, and without it, the cathedral simply could not function.

Published in 1951, it depicts a variety of arguments in terms of applied world history and social psychology to explain why mass movements arise to challenge the status quo. Hoffer discusses the sense of individual identity and the holding to particular ideals that can lead to fanaticism among both leaders and followers.Hoffer, 1951, p. 10 Hoffer initially attempts to explain the motives of the various types of personalities that give rise to mass movements in the first place and why certain efforts succeed while many others fail. He goes on to articulate a cyclical view of history such that why and how said movements start, progress and end is explored. Whether intended to be cultural, ideological, religious, or whatever else, Hoffer argues that mass movements are broadly interchangeable even when their stated goals or values differ dramatically. This makes sense, in the author's view, given the frequent similarities between them in terms of the psychological influences on its adherents. Thus, many will often flip from one movement to another, Hoffer asserts, and the often shared motivations for participation entail practical effects. Since, whether radical or reactionary, the movements tend to attract the same sort of people in his view, the author describes them as fundamentally using the same tactics including possessing the rhetorical tools. As examples, he often refers to the purported political enemies of communism and fascism as well as the religions of Christianity and Islam. The first and best-known of Hoffer's books, The True Believer has been published in twenty-three editions between 1951 and 2002. He later touched upon similar themes in other works. Prominent leaders and social commentators who have remarked publicly about their interest in the book include American President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as American Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary R. Clinton. Although receiving widespread popular acclaim, the socio- political debate spurred on by the book in terms of academic analysis and commentary has been ongoing. The core thesis of the interchangeability of mass movements and the inherent weakness within them that can cause adherents to slide into dogma and absolutism has attracted significant challenge; multiple scholars have used historical examples of solid group identities that rarely became interchangeable with other communities. Hoffer himself stated that he intended his analysis not to inherently condemn all mass movements in all contexts, particularly citing figures such as Jesus of Nazareth as those who promoted positive ideals. However, he continued to stress the central argument of his work. Summary =Part 1. The Appeal of Mass Movements= Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread \\"desire for change\\" from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are \\"irredeemably spoiled\\" and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek \\"self- renunciation\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 12 Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people's hearts. While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: \\"All mass movements are competitive\\" and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and \\"all mass movements are interchangeable\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 17 As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst R√∂hm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals. =Part 2. The Potential Converts= The \\"New Poor\\" are the most likely source of converts for mass movements, for they recall their former wealth with resentment and blame others for their current misfortune. Examples include the mass evictions of relatively prosperous tenants during the English Civil War of the 1600s or the middle- and working-classes in Germany who passionately supported Hitler in the 1930s after suffering years of economic hardship. In contrast, the \\"abjectly poor\\" on the verge of starvation make unlikely true believers as their daily struggle for existence takes pre-eminence over any other concern.Hoffer, 1951, pp. 26‚Äì27 Racial and religious minorities, particularly those only partly assimilated into mainstream culture, are also found in mass movements. Those who live traditionalist lifestyles tend to be content, but the partially assimilated feel alienated from both their forbearers and the mainstream culture (\\"the orthodox Jew is less frustrated than the emancipated Jew\\"Hoffer, 1951, p. 50). A variety of what Hoffer terms \\"misfits\\" are also found in mass movements. Examples include \\"chronically bored\\", the physically disabled or perpetually ill, the talentless, and criminals or \\"sinners\\". In all cases, Hoffer argues, these people feel as if their individual lives are meaningless and worthless.Hoffer, 1951, pp. 46‚Äì55 Hoffer argues that the relatively low number of mass movements in the United States at that time was attributable to a culture that blurred traditionally rigid boundaries between nationalist, racial and religious groups and allowed greater opportunities for individual accomplishment. =Part 3. United Action and Self-Sacrifice= In mass movements, an individual's goals or opinions are unimportant. Rather, the mass movement's \\"chief preoccupation is to foster, perfect and perpetuate a facility for united action and self-sacrifice\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 58 Mass movements have several means. Mass movements demand a \\"total surrender of a distinct self\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 117 One identifies the most as ‚Äúa member of a certain tribe or family,\\" whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist.Hoffer, 1951, p. 62 Every important part of the true believer's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a \\"primitive state of being\\" common among pre-modern cultures.Hoffer, 1951, p. 63 Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis. While mass movements idealize the past and glorify the future, the present world is denigrated: \\"The radical and the reactionary loathe the present.\\"Hoffer, 1951, p. 74 Thus, by regarding the modern world as vile and worthless, mass movements inspire a perpetual battle against the present. Mass movements aggressively promote the use of doctrines that elevate faith over reason and serve as \\"fact-proof screens between the faithful and the realities of the world\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 79 The doctrine of the mass movement must not be questioned under any circumstances. Examples include the Japanese holdouts, who refused to believe that the Second World War was over, or the staunch defenders of the Soviet Union, who rejected overwhelming evidence of Bolshevik atrocities. To spread and reinforce their doctrine, mass movements use persuasion, coercion, and proselytization. Persuasion is preferable but practical only with those already sympathetic to the mass movement. Moreover, persuasion must be thrilling enough to excite the listener yet vague enough to allow \\"the frustrated to... hear the echo of their own musings in the impassioned double talk\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 106 Hoffer quotes Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels: \\"a sharp sword must always stand behind propaganda if it is to be really effective\\". The urge to proselytize comes not from a deeply held belief in the truth of doctrine but from an urge of the fanatic to \\"strengthen his own faith by converting others\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 110 Successful mass movements need not believe in a god, but they must believe in a devil. Hatred unifies the true believers, and \\"the ideal devil is a foreigner\\" attributed with nearly supernatural powers of evil.Hoffer, 1951, p. 93 For example, Hitler described Jews as foreign interlopers and moreover an ephemeral Jewishness, alleged to taint the German soul, was as vehemently condemned as were flesh-and-blood Jews. The hatred of a true believer is actually a disguised self-loathing, as with the condemnation of capitalism by socialists while Russia under the Bolsheviks saw more intensive monopolization of the economy than any other nation in history. Without a devil to hate, mass movements often falter (for example, Chiang Kai-shek effectively led millions of Chinese during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s and the 1940s but quickly fell out of favor once the Japanese were defeated). Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that \\"the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure\\"Hoffer, 1951, p. 85 and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life. =Part 4. Beginning and End= Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, \\"men of words\\", \\"fanatics\\", and \\"practical men of action\\". No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time. Mass movements begin with \\"men of words\\" or \\"fault-finding intellectuals\\" such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Gandhi, Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to \\"discredit the prevailing creeds\\" and creates a \\"hunger for faith\\" which is then fed by \\"doctrines and slogans of the new faith\\".Hoffer, 1951, p. 140 A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement. Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the \\"creative man of words\\" finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the \\"noncreative man of words\\" feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy. The fanatic feels fulfilled only in a perpetual struggle for power and change. Examples include Jean-Paul Marat, Maximilien de Robespierre, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. The book also explores the behavior of mass movements once they become established as social institutions (or leave the \\"active phase\\"). With their collapse of a communal framework, people can no longer defeat their abiding feelings of insecurity and uncertainty by belonging to a compact whole. If the isolated individual lacks opportunities for personal advancement, development of talents, and action (such as those found on a frontier), he will seek substitutes. The substitutes would be pride instead of self-confidence, memberships in a collective whole like a mass movement, absolute certainty instead of understanding. The \\"practical men of action\\" take over leadership from the fanatics, marking the end of the \\"dynamic phase\\" and steering the mass movement away from the fanatic's self-destructiveness. \\"Hitler, who had a clear vision of the whole course of a movement even while he was nursing his infant National Socialism, warned that a movement retains its vigor only so long as it can offer nothing in the present.... The movement at this stage still concerns itself with the frustrated‚Äînot to harness their discontent in a deadly struggle with the present, but to reconcile them with it; to make them patient and meek.\\" The focus shifts from immediate demands for revolution to establishing the mass movement as a social institution where the ambitious can find influence and fame. Leadership uses an eclectic bricolage of ideological scraps to reinforce the doctrine, borrowing from whatever source is successful in holding the attention of true believers. For example, proto-Christians were fanatics, predicting the end of the world, condemning idolatry, demanding celibacy and sowing discontent between family members, yet from those roots grew Roman Catholicism, which mimicked the elaborate bureaucratic structure of the Roman Empire, canonized early Christians as saints, and borrowed pagan holidays and rites. In the absence of a practical man of action, the mass movement often withers and dies with the fanatic (Nazism died as a viable mass movement with Hitler's death). Mass movements that succeed in causing radical change often exceed in brutality the former regime that the mass movement opposed. The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Jacobins in France ostensibly formed in reaction to the oppression of their respective monarchies but proved themselves far more vicious and brutal in oppressing their opponents. Hoffer does not take an exclusively negative view of \\"true believers\\" and the mass movements they begin. He gives examples of how the same forces that give rise to true believer mass movements can be channelled in more positive ways: Hoffer argues that the length of the \\"active phase\\" of a mass movement, the most energetic phase when fanatics are in control, can be predicted with some accuracy. Mass movements with a specific goal tend to be shorter-lived and feature less terror and bloodshed (such as the American Revolution). In contrast, an amorphous goal tends to result in a longer active phase of decades rather than months or years and also include substantially more bloodshed (such as the Bolsheviks in Russia, National Socialism in Germany). In either case, Hoffer suggests that mass movements are accompanied by a dearth of creative innovation because so much energy is devoted to the mass movement. For example, in England, John Milton began a draft of his epic poem Paradise Lost in the 1640s before turning his literary talents to pamphleteering for the Commonwealth of England, only to finish the poem and his other major works after a change in government in 1660. Reception U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower read The True Believer in 1952, gave copies to friends, and recommended it to others. In 1956, Look ran an article calling Hoffer \\"Ike's Favorite Author\\". British philosopher Bertrand Russell called the book \\"as sound intellectually as it is timely politically.\\" Self-education advocate and writer Allen Scarbrough chose The True Believer as one of twenty- five books that \\"you need to read to know just about everything\\". The True Believer earned renewed attention after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and this occurred again also after the Tea Party protests and the Occupy Wall Street protests around a decade later.Cupp, S.E. (2011). \\"What Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party have in common: Right or left, all mass movements are the same: A book of sociology from 1951 has plenty to teach us today\\", New York Daily News, 16 November 2011 Hillary Clinton wrote in her 2017 book What Happened, a work discussing her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, cited The True Believer as a book that she recommended to her staff during the campaign.

Crichton also directed Pursuit, a television film version. The story of both the book and the film revolve around a deadly nerve agent composed by combining two different chemicals. Hard Case Crime republished the novel under Crichton's name in 2013.http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by- topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/59350-hard-case-crime-to-publish- early-crichton-thrillers.html  Plot summary  State Department agent John Graves is investigating far-right businessman John Wright who has been acting suspiciously ‚Äì he has masterminded the theft of several canisters of VZ nerve gas, a binary agent, and has enough of both canister types to kill nearly a million people, but the Agency is unsure of his motives. During his investigation Graves establishes that Wright has acquired many other purchases; plastic explosives, large containers made of an exotic flammable material, seemingly of plumbing and pressure related nature ‚Äì and also rented a small 19th floor apartment in San Diego where the President of the United States is due to meet for the imminent Republican Party convention, and deduces that Wright intends to assassinate the President. Graves' task is made harder by inter-departmental interference, a lack of support from his manager Phelps, and that Wright has stolen a copy of Graves' State Department psychological profile, and seems to be depending on Graves behaving according to his profile. Wright correctly predicts Graves' actions, and ultimately allows himself to be captured in order to distract Graves from continuing his investigation ‚Äì only to successfully escape moments later, again predicting Graves' behaviour during the interrogation. However prior to the interrogation Graves had decided against roadblocks surrounding the apartment, but realised that this was playing true to his profile, and changed his mind ‚Äì Wright is subsequently killed trying to break through the unexpected blockade. Observing the apartment through binoculars the two large canisters of the VZ nerve agent are seen, with plumbing attachments in order to correctly mix and disperse the two components. Also observed is a remote timing detonator, and several booby traps. Seeing that the remote detonator is attached to mains electricity, the police cut off the supply, only for a battery backup to take over, and a small gas release is seen resulting in the death of two police officers stationed outside the apartment. The apartment is engulfed in VZ gas and inaccessible. Although there is no cure for VZ, Nordmann ‚Äì a forensic scientist attached to the case ‚Äì reasons that there are other chemicals that can stave off the effects of VZ, possibly long enough for Graves to enter the apartment, nullify the remote detonator and leave again. Graves takes the chemicals, noting with irony that they may also kill him, and enters the apartment. Once inside he finds that the booby traps are a sham, and the only danger is from the VZ gas itself which he vents through a window ‚Äì being on the 19th floor the gas dissipates harmlessly into the unoccupied street below. Moments after he disconnects the pipes from the tanks the timer activates and click open ‚Äì but being disconnected no gas is created, and Graves leaves the apartment pensive, thinking that the victory has been too easily achieved. To support this theory he discusses his psychological profile with Nordmann & Phelps, stressing that his key psyche flaw is that he considers tasks complete when in reality they are often only partially finished. Phelps is dismissive, but Nordmann supports Graves' theory, and he is partially vindicated when a booby trap disables the lifts, trapping everybody on the 19th floor ‚Äì but the booby trap was timed to go off after the venting was complete. Graves takes this to mean that Wright knew he might disarm the tanks, and so had a backup plan. He recalls the flammable nature of the tanks, and the missing plastic explosive, reasoning that Wright had intended the tanks to explode after being emptied ‚Äì thus destroying any lingering evidence. Panicking, he realises that if the still- full tanks explode in the same room, enough of the two agents would still combine to kill thousands, and that this is Wright's backup plan. One tank is frantically manhandled out of the open venting window and it explodes as it falls to the street. The other tank explodes in the hallway of the apartment block. The two binary chemicals are harmless by themselves, and nobody is injured by either the liquid chemicals or the explosions. In an aftermath Graves observes that in order to prevent public panic the incident is hushed up, being only referred to as a chemical theft and that although official departmental changes are recommended to prevent any further thefts, nothing is actually mandated, and no policy changes are made. Reception The Guardian said it had a \\"dotty, old-hat plot made unexpectedly credible with new gadgetry and well-engineered surprises\\".

The Chinese and Taiwanese people have a long history together, with the first Han Chinese settlers arriving in Taiwan in the seventeenth century. The Japanese empire occupied Taiwan (also known as Formosa) following its cessation from Qing dynasty China in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) at the conclusion of the First Sino-Japanese War. This period of occupation lasted until the Japanese surrender of WW2 During this period the colonial government of Japan initiated major policies to reduce the consumption of opium and opium derived products with much regarded success from contemporary sources both from the Japanese Colonial government and international sources. There is a long history of opium use in Taiwan dating back to the arrival of the Han Chinese settlers in the 18th Century. The opium habit in Taiwan grew as a result of the Opium Wars in China, which inevitability led to the forced legalisation of opium in 1890. Between 1890 and 1891 the amount of legal opium imported into Taiwan increased from sixty kilos to four hundred thousand kilo. In 1892 alone the opium trade made up half of Taiwan's revenue sources, resulting in the widespread presence of opium throughout Taiwan.  Opium  Opium Poppy Opium is a highly addictive type of depressant drug which dates back to 3400BC. The opium poppy pods contain a milky substance called latex, which is made up of a number of chemicals such as morphine and codeine. The Latex from the pods is boiled and dried to become opium. Opium has been used throughout history recreationally and as medicine, with historians predicting that opium was likely introduced throughout East Asia in the sixth century A.D. along the Silk Road trade route. The First and Second Opium Wars of the19th century between the British Empire and Qing Dynasty saw the continued spread of opium throughout East Asia. While opium presented the opportunity for a lucrative trading market to many countries, the devastating impact of the addictive substance caused havoc across East Asia as well as throughout the US and Europe.  Japanese views on opium  The Meiji Japanese held a negative view of opium and regarded it as an uncivilized and lazy practice. These fears may have stemmed from their observation of its effects on the Chinese population as well as aggression from western powers to force its export. These fears were exacerbated by American diplomats such as Townsend Harris that described opium as \\"the one great enemy of China\\" and that it \\"injures like the most deadly poison\\". The Meiji government strictly prohibited importation, possession and usage of opium except for medicinal purposes until 1868. Opium smoking in Japan was a rare occurrence and the punishment of the practice strict. During the cessation of Taiwan to Japan, opium smoking was regarded as one of the \\"Three vices\\" along with foot binding and the queue hairstyle that should be abolished. The Prime Mister at the negotiation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, It≈ç Hirobumi expressed that \\"There have been people living in Taiwan long before the arrival of opium,‚Äù and that \\"The Japanese government will definitely prohibit opium after occupying Taiwan\\".However, there were fears that the practice may spread to Japan from Taiwan and also concerns that punishing opium usage could lead to anti-Japanese sentiment from Taiwanese locals. It≈ç Hirobumi also expressed the contemporary Japanese view that that widespread opium usage was factor in Qing China's decline, stating \\"Opium smokers are rather lazy, and therefore soldiers cannot be at their best\\".  Annexation of Taiwan from China  In 1894 the Sino-Japanese War began over Japan's invasion of Korea. The Qing Dynasty was underprepared for the war and was overwhelmed by the power and force of the Japanese fleet. China was left humiliated by their defeat and in 1895 signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki which conceded Taiwan to Japanese rule in perpetuity. Taiwan was officially named Formosa under Japanese rule. The Taiwanese rebelled against the promise of Japanese rule and on 25 May 1985 established the ‚ÄòRepublic of Formosa‚Äô. On 29 May over 12,000 Japanese troops arrived in Taiwan and begun disbanding the Taiwanese movement for independence. The 'Republic of Formosa was officially defeated in October 1895 and Japanese occupation of Taiwan commenced. The Japanese government viewed Taiwan as a resource for Japan's industries and saw an opportunity for a colonial market of Japanese goods and services which could improve the Japanese economy. The Japanese government's opium policies throughout 1895 to 1945 were highly controversial given Taiwan's long history with opium smoking. As well as the innate political and economic motivations of the Japanese government in interfering with the practice. Taiwan's long history with opium is strongly associated with Taiwan's close relationship with China throughout history. In 1544, Taiwan was used as a Dutch service station for ships sailing to China and Japan. It was during this period that opium was heavily trafficked by the Dutch from the East Indies through to Taiwan and then onto China. The use of Taiwan as a trading port continued throughout the Chinese occupation of Taiwan prior to the annexation. Taiwan was used as a Chinese trading centre for the French, Dutch and Portuguese where opium was continually traded across Taiwan. As a result, opium because widespread throughout Taiwanese society and the profitability of the trade was identified.  Formosa  Formosa was a Japanese colony for over 50 years, from 1895 to the end of WWII in 1945. During the first three years of Japan's colonial rule, the Japanese military governed the island. However, in 1898 T≈çky≈ç began appointing Japanese Governors to oversee Taiwan. As Taiwan was Japan's first colony, many resources were used to ensure the success of the colony Formosa. Japan had widespread success in establishing order throughout the colony by working to eradicate diseases as well as improve the colonies infrastructure and overall economy. Japanese rule modernised Taiwan following the ‚ÄòMeiji‚Äô restoration processes. Their initial policies focused on growing the agricultural industry by working to improve production outputs and farming techniques. The Japanese also built highways and improved the existing infrastructure of railway tracks which aimed to increase access to isolated areas the island and stimulate the economy. Taiwan Initially had 50 km of railway track when the Japanese first took control of the colony and worked to develop upwards of 500 km of railway tracks. The Japanese also constructed schools, hospitals and other key infrastructure such as roads, productive farms and trade ports. The Japanese government intended to propel Taiwan into a modern economy, and as a result became of the most advanced countries in East Asia. Formosa experienced a shift in cultural identity as a result of Japanese rule. Although Formosa was not technically assimilated with Japanese culture, the local Taiwanese populations were forced to speak Japanese instead of their native language resulting in the loss of local culture. The Japanese ruled the Taiwanese people strictly, dictating policies which represented Japanese interests. A key aspect of the policies which were created to benefit Japanese interests at the time, involved control of the opium trade and strict regulation of its presence throughout Taiwanese and Japanese society. Japan's desire to \\"civilise\\" Formosa and the \\"savages\\" which occupied the land extended past infrastructure and education, and focussed largely on opium usage. The practise of smoking opium was seen as primitive and dangerous by the Japanese hick as a threat to their ideology and their perception in the global world.  Taiwan Opium Edict of 1897  In 1895 the short-lived 'Republic of Formosa' resistance leaders created fake 'Japanese issued propaganda' stating that opium would be banned in the hope it would drive supporters to their cause. In response, the Japanese government made it temporality legal to continue smoking opium for the local Taiwanese residents, while stating it was punishable by death to supply opium to any Japanese individual. After the Republic of Formosa was defeated, the Japanese government took great issue with the prevalence of opium through Taiwan, fearing it would spread to Japan if not monitored correctly. On 21 January 1897 the Japanese government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict which established a new opium policy for Taiwan. The Edict outlined the Japanese government's monopoly over the trade of opium and the restricted sale of the drug to \\"proven addicts\\" with the necessary licences. The process of 'Licensed opium usage' took three years to complete and resulted in just under 200,000 licences . Japan's opium policy was conducted under the administration and leadership of the East Asia Development Board (K≈çain) in operation from December 1938 to November 1942. The policy meant Taiwanese nationals who already addicted to opium could continue to smoke under government regulation. However, by the 1920s there were as many unregistered opium users as registered opium users. The imbalance between the number of registered and unregistered opium smokers demonstrated that the policy was ineffective at keeping nonusers from taking up smoking. Opium dens were common place throughout Southeast Asia. They were establishments where opium was sold and smoked and were frequented by locals and foreigners who were looking to access opium.  Opium trade as a revenue source  Two opium smokers in a Shanghai, China, den in the early 20th century ‚Äì Collectors Weekly The 'Opium Edict' is viewed by some historians as the initial demonstration by the Japanese government of their intentions to profit from the opium trade. The government was in the process of making the opium trade a monopoly for their individual gain, whilst simultaneously developing policies which permitted users to continue smoking and prohibited people from starting to smoke. In 1896, 1 year after the Japanese began establishing a monopoly, opium revenue made up 60% of Taiwan's total yearly revenue, which continued to grow throughout the 1900s. The monopoly led to an increase in revenue achieved by inflated prices of opium and an overall decrease of smokers. The outcome of the Opium Edict suggests that the Opium policy had a twofold function, in that, revenue was needed to fund Japan's occupation of Formosa and that controlling opium usage in Taiwan was a direct method of controlling the population. Another function of the opium policy was the economic prosperity achieved by the government as a result of the monopoly which could be used to further Japan's colonial interests. The rise of Japan's militarism in the late 1930s saw Japan rely more heavily on the resources of their colonies. As World War II progressed, opium licensing became a source of much-needed revenue for Japan's war efforts. Japan used Taiwan's resources and manpower to support them in their war effort as well as the revenue of the opium trade. The opium trade was so profitable for the Japanese government and supported the needs of the military to such an extent that in 1942 the Japanese government expanded their revenue operation to included 277 kg of cocaine, which was processed by the Japanese colonial government in Taiwan.

Dawson was best known for his trademark 'sniping runs' and played the whistle well, often scoring tries from 'tap and go' penalties. When called upon, he could also demonstrate his versatility by kicking goals. Since retiring, Dawson has become a team captain on A Question of Sport besides appearing on various reality shows and is a commentator and presenter on BBC Radio 5 Live's rugby programme. Dawson currently works as a health ambassador for Sodexo, a global food and facilities provider. In early 2014, he was appointed as director for business development at the flexible workplace company, Instant. Rugby career =Club= Dawson joined Northampton in 1991 after leaving school and was among the last generation of players to have started their careers during the amateur era. Before rugby union became openly professional in 1995 he worked as a security guard and coached at Spratton Hall School. He formed a successful half-back partnership with Paul Grayson, winning the 2000 Heineken Cup (though he missed the final through injury) and finishing runner- up in the Anglo-Welsh Cup three times. In the club's 130th anniversary poll he and Grayson were voted by fans into the all-time dream XV. In 2004, Dawson moved from Northampton to London Wasps after his contract was not renewed and won the Premiership title in his first season. On 7 April 2006, Dawson announced that he would be retiring from rugby completely at the end of the season and on 14 May 2006, he played his last game of Premiership rugby, when Sale denied Wasps their chance of winning the Premiership title four years in a row and so equalling Leicester's record. =International= In 1993, Dawson was a member of the England Sevens team which won the inaugural Sevens World Cup in Scotland. Dawson and competition teammate Lawrence Dallaglio are therefore the only players to have won the World Cup at both the 15- and 7-a-side games. Dawson made his international debut for England in December 1995, against Western Samoa, but would have to fight with Andy Gomarsall, Austin Healey but mostly Kyran Bracken for the England number 9 shirt. Dawson went on the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa as third-choice scrum half behind Rob Howley and Austin Healey but injury to Howley and some good performances saw him make the starting line-up. In the first test with ten minutes to go, Dawson broke from the base of a scrum and threw an overhead dummy that checked the four Springboks allowing him to scamper in for the winning try. That victory was the start of a 2‚Äì1 series win, clinched when he fed Jeremy Guscott for the series-winning drop goal. Dawson captained England for the first time when he was chosen as captain for the infamous 1998 \\"tour from hell\\" in the absence of more experienced internationals. Despite the disastrous results he would go on to establish himself in the starting XV. He became first-choice scrum half at the 1999 Rugby World Cup after Bracken's withdrawal due to injury and scored England's first try of the competition just eight minutes into the opening match, a 67‚Äì7 win, against Italy. He was captain in the 2000 Six Nations and often in the absence of Martin Johnson. In the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, Dawson went as second- choice scrum half behind Howley. Howley played in the first two tests but was injured for the third, where Dawson played. Controversially however, Dawson was one of the mid-week side opposed to the training regime of coach Graham Henry and publicly criticised him, although this did not cause as much stir as Healey's similar comments. He and Healey avoided being sent home but were fined by the disciplinary committee. Later in the week he redeemed himself by converting Healey's try during extra time to win a closely tied match against the Brumbies. Dawson's career nearly ended after sustaining a neck injury during the record 53‚Äì3 win against South Africa in November 2002, when he was headbutted by Springbok skipper Corn√© Krige. He became an integral part of the England side, winning his 50th cap against Ireland on the same day England won the 2003 Six Nations Grand Slam. That same year he was a crucial part of the team that won the World Cup. He played a vital role in winning the final tie against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003. With less than a minute remaining in extra time he made a completely unexpected break gaining a vital 20 metres upfield. From the later ruck he fed the ball to Jonny Wilkinson for the winning drop goal. In the autumn of 2004, he failed to turn up to an England training camp due to a previously arranged commitment to appear on A Question of Sport, resulting in him being dropped from the England squad for the 2004 Autumn internationals. A return to the 2005 Six Nations was expected and Dawson rejoined the Elite Player Squad for the tournament, playing well enough to earn a place on the 2005 British Lions tour to New Zealand, managed by Sir Clive Woodward. Dawson returned to the England fold in 2005 but had limited opportunities in a disappointing Six Nations campaign as Harry Ellis started at number nine for four of the five matches. Media career In 2004 Dawson joined the long-running BBC TV quiz show A Question of Sport, featuring as a regular team captain opposite Ally McCoist and subsequently, Phil Tufnell. In September 2006 he appeared in BBC One's Celebrity MasterChef programme, beating Roger Black and Hardeep Singh Kohli, to win the final. He took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2006, partnered by Lilia Kopylova. Although appearing initially to be an unlikely contender, he came second, only beaten in the final by cricketer Mark Ramprakash. He later returned to the show in 2008 to dance with Elaine Paige in Sport Relief does Strictly Come Dancing to raise money for Sport Relief, where they came second. In January 2007 it was announced that Dawson would be joining BBC Radio Five Live as summariser for the commentary on England's forthcoming Six Nations Championship games. He went on to cover the 2007 Rugby World Cup for the BBC. He also presents 5-Live's weekly Rugby show. He was recently on an edition of www.888.com TV poker special where he finished second. In 2008 Dawson co- hosted Mitch and Matt's Big Fish, a seafood lovers tour of the British coast, in which he and Mitch Tonks tasted and cooked a variety of fish dishes using the catch of the British fishing ports. In 2010 Dawson hosted Monster Munchies for Good Food, where he challenged two teams to make a monster sized local delicacy in 24 hours, which were unveiled at a local show and were judged on size, presentation and taste. The size they were aiming for was that of a small car. Charitable work Dawson is the 2013 President of children's medical research charity Sparks, whose mission is to ensure that all babies are born healthy and stay healthy. Matt attended their 2012 Winter Ball along with other supporters of the charity such as Lady Gabriella Windsor, who was in attendance in place of her mother, Sparks Royal Patron, Princess Michael of Kent. In 2015, he fronted a cycle ride for the charity from the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to Twickenham in London, 150 mile in one day. Dawson in Johannesburg with pupils of a UNICEF-funded school. He is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland. He posed nude in the women's magazine Cosmopolitan in support of the testicular and prostate cancer charity Everyman. Dawson has been supporting the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) since 2004, and became a UNICEF UK ambassador in 2009. In June 2009, he took time out while broadcasting for the Lions tour in South Africa to visit UNICEF programmes focusing on education, shelter and HIV/AIDS. He completed the 2007 London Marathon for charity, in 4 hours 35 minutes and 39 seconds. *Patron of The National Hospital Development Foundation (NHDF) *Patron of Beating Bowel Cancer ‚Äì a leading UK charity for bowel cancer patients, working to raise awareness of symptoms, promote early diagnosis and encourage open access to treatment choice for those affected by bowel cancer. Personal life Born in Birkenhead, Dawson was raised in Buckinghamshire and attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe after passing the 11-plus. While in school he excelled in cricket and football before deciding to concentrate on rugby. He is married to German-born former model, Carolin Hauskeller, and the couple have two sons. On 22nd September 2020 he announced on Twitter they had gone their separate ways. Dawson is a supporter of Everton F.C.. In 2012, on the CBBC series 12 Again Dawson revealed at age twelve he played an extra in the video to Culture Club's song The War Song in 1984 dressed up as a skeleton. In 2016, Dawson revealed how his family went through \\"two weeks of hell\\" as his two-year-old son battled meningitis W135. In 2017, Dawson joined forces with The Big Tick Project, which looks to raise awareness about the dangers of ticks and tick-borne disease in the UK after revealing he had contracted Lyme disease. He was bitten by a tick in a London park early the previous year.

It was operated by the Kempeitai, the Japanese military police. Its headquarters was located in Mokotan, Manchukuo, a village just south of the city of Changchun. It had branches in Dairen and Hailar. The Hailar branch was later transferred to Foshan. Between 600 and 800 people worked at Unit 100.  Organization  Unit 100 had six sections. # Bacteriological section # Pathological section # Animal Experimentation # Organic chemistry # Botanical, and plant pathology. Poisoning, or infecting, plants with the help of bacteria. # Preparations for bacteriological warfare Mission The main purpose of Unit 100 was to conduct research about diseases originating from animals. As most armies were still heavily dependent on horses, the Imperial Japanese Army hoped to find ways to kill them and therefore to weaken military power. Furthermore, they hoped to spread disease via animal carriers. To this end, former members claim that experiments were also conducted with human beings. In practice, Unit 731 was the group tasked with developing biological weapons against humans. Although smaller than Unit 731, Unit 100 was still a large organization. Its annual bacteria production capacity was projected to reach 1,000 kg of anthrax, 500 kg of glanders, and 100 kg of red rust (fungus). The goal was never reached, due to equipment shortages. Senior Sgt. Kazuo Mitomo described some of Unit 100's human experiments: \\"I put as much as a gram of heroin into some porridge and gave this porridge to an arrested Chinese citizen who ate it; about 20 minutes later he lost consciousness and remained in that state until he died 15-16 hours later. We knew that such a dose of heroin is fatal, but it did not make any difference to us whether he died or lived. On some of the prisoners I experimented 5-6 times, testing the action of Korean bindweed, bactal and castor oil seeds. One of the prisoners of Russian nationality became so exhausted from the experiments that no more could be performed on him, and Matsui ordered me to kill that Russian by giving him an injection of potassium cyanide. After the injection, the man died at once. Bodies were buried in the unit's cattle cemetery.\\" Unit chief Yujiro Wakamatsu ordered Hirazakura to purchase hundreds of cattle and put them to pasture along the Siberian border north-east of Hailar, ready to be infected by airborne dispersion. It was hoped that in the event of a Soviet invasion these infected livestock would mingle with local herds to cause epidemics and to destroy food supplies. Unit 100 staff poisoned and drugged Russians, Chinese and Koreans with heroin, castor oil, tobacco and other substances for weeks at a time. Some died during the experimentation. When survivors were determined to no longer be useful for experimentation and were complaining of illness, staff told them they would receive a shot of medicine, but instead executed them with potassium cyanide injections. Executions were also carried out by gunshots.  Capabilities  Unit 100 could produce 1,000 kilograms of anthrax germs, 500 kilograms of glanders germs, and 100 kilograms of redrust germs in a single year.

A spiedie consists of cubes of chicken, pork, lamb, veal, venison or beef. The meat cubes are marinated overnight or longer, then grilled on spits over a charcoal pit. The traditional method involves serving freshly prepared cubes of lamb, chicken, or beef on soft Italian bread or a submarine roll, occasionally drizzled with fresh marinade. Spiedie meat cubes can also be eaten straight off the skewer or can be served in salads, stir fries, and a number of other dishes. The marinade recipe varies, usually involving olive oil, vinegar, and a variety of Italian spices and fresh mint. Spiedies have been celebrated at the Spiedie Fest and Balloon Rally in Binghamton, New York, every August since 1983. The annual event includes a spiedie cook-off in search of the best spiedie recipes. Etymology The term \\"spiedie\\" is derived from the Italian spiedo meaning spit. The regional dish called spiedini or spidducci in Abruzzo, Italy, most closely resembling spiedie, uses cubes or balls of goat meat, lamb, chicken or beef on a skewer. History The original idea for the spiedie was brought by Italian immigrants to upstate New York in the early 1920s. The specific origin of the spiedie is disputed. Traditionally, the early Broome County spiedie was made only from spring lamb, but currently most commercial restaurants prepare spiedies using chicken or pork. The \\"chicken category\\" was added to the Spiedie Fest cook-off in 1987, and quickly became the most popular meat choice. =Origins= Camillo Iacovelli created the spiedie in Endwell, New York, and was serving them in 1938 at his Parkview Restaurant on Oak Hill Ave in Endicott. His brother, Agostino \\"Augie\\" Iacovelli, popularized spiedies when he introduced them in his Endicott restaurant Augie's in 1939. Iacovelli's marinade, which he called \\"zuzu\\", originally was made simply from wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, garlic and mint. Italian spices, olive oil and minced onion were added later as regional tastes and the choice of meat began to vary. Augie Iacovelli's son Guido continued in the spiedie business into the 1990s, owning as many as 26 restaurants at the peak of his career. Peter Sharak is also alleged to have invented spiedies, and began serving them in 1947 at his Sharkey's Bar and Grill in Binghamton. Sharkey's promotes itself as the birthplace of the sandwich in television commercials across the greater Binghamton area. =Growth in popularity= Spiedies being grilled In 1975, Rob Salamida became the first person to bottle the sauce and sell it. He began by cooking spiedies outside a local tavern at 16. After writing letters for over a year, he was allowed to have his own booth at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, New York. For 12 years he built his reputation at the fair. After a tornado nearly struck his stand in 1975, he decided it would be more lucrative and safer to bottle a spiedie marinade. In 1983, a few families got together and held a Spiedie Fest that was a tremendous hit. Coupled with a Balloon Rally, it quickly grew to an annual festival attracting more than 100,000 attendees (and also one of the top balloon rallies in the country).

The cars were not sold in North America, with the larger Xedos 9/Millenia model offered there instead. In total, 72,101 Xedos 6 and Eunos 500 automobiles were produced. History The rear of a Eunos 500. 1992-1996 Eunos 500 (Australia) The Eunos 500 was initially presented at the 1991 Tokyo Motor Show, and was based on the Mazda CA platform, also used by the Mazda Capella. The car entered full production in January 1992, with Japanese and Australian market models using the Eunos 500 name (as they were sold under the Eunos brand, and not the Mazda brand) and British models utilizing the Mazda Xedos 6 name. Left-hand drive versions of the Xedos 6, destined for mainland Europe, were first produced in 1993. The car's exterior styling was often praised by reviewers, with Honest John stating that it \\"could have been the prototype for a new small Jaguar - with Mazda reliability,\\" however, the interior was also criticized for being too dull. There were also plans to market the car under the Amati 300 name, but they did not come to fruition. The Xedos 6 was available with two different engines: a 1.6-litre straight-four (available in Europe from the beginning of production, in the UK from 1993 onwards) and a 2-litre V6 (available everywhere from the car's launch) The 1.6-litre engine produced , and was criticized for being underpowered, whilst the 2-litre engine produced , and was praised for its smooth, free-revving nature. The V6 models were capable of up to with a manual transmission, and with an automatic transmission, and were claimed to be able to do 30-31 miles per gallon (imperial). In comparison, the 1.6-litre models had a top speed of with a manual transmission, or with an automatic. The engines were updated in 1994 to meet the new Euro 1 emissions standards (reducing the power outputs by for the 1.6 and for the 2-litre,) and again in 1996 to meet the new Euro 2 standards. The 1.6-litre versions, as well as the 2.0 Sport model, were withdrawn from production in 1998, a year before the remaining versions were withdrawn. The Eunos 500 used different engines to the European models. The 1.6-litre engine was not offered in Japan, with the base model instead being a 1.8-litre K8-ZE V6, producing and having a top speed of . The 2-litre V6 was offered in Japan, but in a higher state of tune; Japanese models produced from their KF-ZE engines, and had a top speed of . For 1994, a 1.8-litre straight-four was introduced as the new base model, with a power output of , whilst the 1.8-litre V6 was discontinued. In 1996, following Mazda's decision to axe the Eunos brand, the Eunos 500 was rebranded as the Mazda Eunos 500, and remained in production under that name until 1999. Motorsport The Xedos 6 was used in the British Touring Car Championship in 1993 and 1994. Roger Dowson Engineering ran the works Mazda team in 1993 (under the Mazda Racing Team name,) with the Xedos 6 replacing the 323F that had been used in the previous season.

He finished 15th in the championship, two points behind former champion Tim Harvey in the works Renault 19. Mazda were classified eighth, and last, in the manufacturer's championship. For 1994, Roger Dowson Engineering and Team Dynamics ran the works Mazdas, with David Leslie and Matt Neal being entered in a two-car team, but the season would prove to be less successful. Neal was forced to withdraw from the series after suffering injuries from a big crash in the sixth round at Silverstone, whilst Leslie withdrew halfway through the season due to budgetary problems. Leslie's best finishes were a pair of eighth positions at the first two rounds, whilst Neal's was a tenth at Snetterton. Neal finished 23rd in the championship, level with privateers James Thompson and Nigel Smith, whilst Leslie finished 20th. Mazda were classified tenth, and last, in the manufacturer's championship. The Xedos 6's running gear was later used in a 323F built for the 1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup and driven by Neal.

For example, it is known that pygmy mammoths evolved from normal mammoths on small islands. Similar evolutionary paths have been observed in elephants, hippopotamuses, boas, sloths, deer (such as Key deer) and humans.Juan Luis Arsuaga, Andy Klatt, The Neanderthal's Necklace: In Search of the First Thinkers, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2004, , , p. 199.Jean-Baptiste de Panafieu, Patrick Gries, Evolution, Seven Stories Press, 2007, , , p 42. The rule was first formulated by van Valen in 1973 based on the study by mammalogist J. Bristol Foster in 1964.Foster, J. B. (1965) The evolution of the mammals of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. Occasional Papers of the British Columbia Provincial Museum, 14, 1‚Äì130. In it, Foster compared 116 island species to their mainland varieties. Foster proposed that certain island creatures evolved larger body size (insular gigantism) while others became smaller (insular dwarfism). Foster proposed the simple explanation that smaller creatures get larger when predation pressure is relaxed because of the absence of some of the predators of the mainland, and larger creatures become smaller when food resources are limited because of land area constraints. The idea was expanded upon in The Theory of Island Biogeography, by Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson. In 1978, Ted J. Case published a longer paper on the topic in the journal Ecology. Recent literature has also applied the island rule to plants. There are some cases that do not neatly fit the rule; for example, artiodactyls have on several islands evolved into both dwarf and giant forms.

Biography Gian Domenico Romagnosi was born in Salsomaggiore Terme.Cesare Cant√π (1861), \\"Gian Domenico Romagnosi\\". Torino: Unione Tipografico-Editrice. He studied law at the University of Parma from 1782 to 1786. In 1791 he became the chief civil magistrate of Trento. In the late 18th and early 19th century Trento was successively under the rule of France, Italy and Austria. In 1799 Romagnosi was arrested in Innsbruck during fifteen months by the Austrians on account of his alleged sympathy with the French, but he was acquitted. In 1801 the French occupied Trento, and he was raised to the position of Secretary of the Higher Council. He was successively professor of law at Parma, Pavia, Pisa and Milan. After the fall of Napoleon he lost his position at the Milan university, but continued to lecture till 1817. In 1818 he was again tried for treason at Venice, and again acquitted. Carlo Cattaneo was his student and he was largely influenced by his thought. He died in Milan in 1835. His most celebrated work is Introduzione allo studio del diritto pubblico universale (2 vols., Parma, 1805). Electromagnetism Although Romagnosi was not a scientist, he made some experiments with a voltaic pile and its influence on a compass. He published two accounts of his findings in 1802, in Italian newspapers.Sandro Stringari, Robert R. Wilson (2000), \\"Romagnosi and the discovery of electromagnetism \\", Rendiconti Lincei, Scienze Fisiche e Naturali, serie 9, vol. 11, pp. 115-136. It is sometimes assumed that he found a relationship between electricity and magnetism, about two decades before Hans Christian √òrsted's 1820 discovery of electromagnetism. However, his experiments did not deal with electric currents, and only showed that an electrostatic charge from a voltaic pile could deflect a magnetic needle.Roberto de Andrade Martins (2001), \\"Romagnosi and Volta‚Äôs pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity\\", in Fabio Bevilacqua, Lucio Fregonese (eds), Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times. Pavia / Milano: Universit√† degli Studi di Pavia / Ulrico Hoepli, vol. 3, pp. 81-102. However, as Joseph Hamel has pointed out,Joseph Hamel, Historical Account of the Introduction of the Galvanic and Electro-Magnetic Telegraph (1859), p. 34. Romagnosi's discovery was documented in the book by Joseph Izarn, Manuel du Galvanisme (1805),Izarn (1805), Chapter IX, p. 120. where a galvanic current (courant galvanique) is explicitly mentioned. It was also mentioned on page 340 of the book by Giovanni Aldini, Essai th√©orique et exp√©rimental sur le Galvanisme (1804): \\"Cette nouvelle propri√©t√© du galvanisme a √©t√© constat√©e par d'autres observateurs, et derni√®rement par M.

The original MkI was superseded by the MkII which had a symmetrical windscreen with an arched top in 1981, although production of the original MkI continued for the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive and London Regional Transport until 1983 and 1985 respectively. The Metrobus was conceived as an integral product manufactured completely by MCW, but Alexander and Northern Counties also bodied some examples. MCW planned to produce a single-decker version but this was not to come into production.

In 1987/88, 14 were purchased secondhand Metrobuses from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive, West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and Busways. London Transport's low-cost subsidiary Harrow Buses leased 29 new MkII Metrobuses in 1987, but returned them to their lessor three years later. London Transport's Metrobuses were the mainstay of the double decker fleet between 1987 and privatisation in 1994, when most of them passed to seven of the new operators. MTL bought the London Northern company, with a host of Metrobuses. It acquired more when it took over London Suburban Buses, and including some ex-London examples from its Merseyside operation. Garages were at North Acton, Holloway and Potters Bar. Metroline Northern operations in London dwindled during 2002, with Ms replaced by low-floor buses on most routes. Some clung through 2003 on as deputising on the AEC Routemaster routes, but operation on TfL services ceased in March 2004. Potters Bar was the last outpost, where a handful remained on other services until May 2005; where the Volvo Olympians took over. London General reached the end with Metrobuses in normal service in February 2003, when Stockwell Garage's last were withdrawn. This still left a couple for special purposes (M1440 at Sutton and the \\"spotted cow\\" liveried M1435). There was still a crowd of white-blouse and grey-skirt training buses too, which were mainly moved out from their comfy homes to the Plough Lane open-air space, to make room for the new larger fleet of low-floor WVLs. There is an open-top MCW Metrobus for use by hire in London General; it was also replaced by the withdrawn NVs that left route 74 with a lurch. First CentreWest, First Capital and London United also reached the end with Metrobuses in normal service in 2003. Arriva London also continued using Metrobuses until these were finally displaced in 2002/03. Some of the MCW Metrobuses were converted to open-top for use by The Original Tour. The last were withdrawn by December 2007. London Pride Sightseeing also had MCW Metrobuses, but these were sold to Ensignbus. By 2014, there were no MCW Metrobuses licensed for use in London. = West Midlands = The West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive and its successor, West Midlands Travel, also purchased significant numbers of Metrobuses (over 1,100), both MkI and MkII examples. The first order for five MCW Metrobuses was placed in 1977, with the first delivered in January 1978.Wraps come off Metrobus Commercial Motor 11 February 1977Metrobus arrives in West Midlands Commercial Motor 20 January 1978 Fifty dual-purpose Metrobuses with high-back seats, were purchased in 1986. Many of these buses were converted to normal seated buses and continued in service until November 2008. They were mainly used on limited-stop services. Fourteen guided buses were delivered for route 65 (branded Tracline 65), which was the first guided bus system in the UK, although the experiment only lasted a couple of years.First guided buses Commercial Motor 7 January 1984On the right track Commercial Motor 19 May 1984 The former Birmingham (UK) Tracline 65 Kerb Guided Busway City Transport Info All of the 14 guided buses were converted for conventional use. However they were distinguishable by their dot matrix destination display. In early 1995 Marshall Bus of Cambridge were contracted to overhaul all of West Midland Travel's Metrobus fleet. This was the largest used bus overhaul programme in Europe at the time and Marshalls set up a dedicated business division and staff to handle it. Many unavailable parts had to be sourced and made to original patterns by the Marshall procurement team. A production line was established in one of Marshall's aircraft hangars and anything up to 30 Metrobuses could be found in work at some stage along the line. Duration of refurbishment of each bus was usually 2-3 per week. No powerline items were included with the result that original engines were simply put back in the overhauled buses as they were. This had the effect that as the vehicles were driven from the West Midlands to Marshalls at Cambridge and driven back once completed and frequently broke down. Over 600, mainly MkII, Metrobuses were overhauled with the contract terminated abruptly in 1999 due to lack of confidence in Marshall Bus over delays with WMT orders for new single deck buses. The last were withdrawn in July 2010.Metrobus farewell National Express West Midlands August 2010 A few were retained as driver training vehicles until 2017, however. In 2017 National Express West Midlands purchased a preserved (D957 NDA, 2957) example to add to its vintage hire fleet. National Express West Midlands (then Travel West Midlands) had previously sold this bus to a dealer in 2003. As a result, National Express West Midlands now owns a Metrobus for events and hire. 2957's listing on WM Bus Photo's fleetlist. The Green Bus were operating various former Harrow Buses MkII and former National Express West Midlands Mk-IIA Metrobuses on both school services and commercial services until the end of 2013, with two entering preservation, and the rest either sold on or going for scrap. = Greater Manchester = While they failed with the Leyland Titan (ordered 190, only 15 delivered), they were more successful with the conventional MCW Metrobuses which were delivered between 1979 and 1983. All 190 were ordered in total over a space of four years and were primarily used in Stockport, Tameside, Oldham, Manchester, Altrincham and on services linking Manchester with Rochdale, Salford and Trafford and services linking Stockport with Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport Around 1986, Northern Counties delivered 30 more MCW Metrobuses which had bodywork that was more to a Manchester standard design. They were first used on the Trans Lancs 400 express service linking Bolton with Stockport (and on Sundays Manchester Airport via Bury, Rochdale, Oldham, Ashton-Under-Lyne, and Wythenshawe (when running between Manchester Airport and Bolton). = South Yorkshire = South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) purchased over 100 examples between 1981 and 1985. The SYPTE standard fully sprung seats were fitted along with 20 MkIIs having coach seats for express work. The vehicles were noted for quick acceleration although had distinctive engine noise and were rust prone around the engine bay. Meanwhile, also in South Yorkshire, Yorkshire Traction took delivery of the Metrobus, an order that was actually made when that company was under NBC ownership. These Metrobuses were unique in that they were built to a low height specification. They operated mainly around the Barnsley and Huddersfield areas but often rubbed shoulders with their SYT cousins on routes into Sheffield. The Metrobus also found sales to National Bus Company companies prior to privatisation, Maidstone & District Motor Services and Northern General Transport Company purchased significant numbers.  Hong Kong  = Early introductions = In Hong Kong, the China Motor Bus (CMB) introduced 12 Metrobuses (MC1-MC12) in 1978 for its luxury coach services (which covered the routes between Repulse Bay, Stanley and the Central District). Within a year, MCW produced an 11-metre 2-axle version of Metrobus. Only 40 were produced all for CMB as MB1-MB40 in 1978/79. They were used mostly on express and cross-harbour services. Both batches of CMB Metrobuses had MkI bodies. = 1980s = Preserved China Motor Bus Metrobus MkII ML1 in George Street, Sydney in January 2007 Kowloon Motor Bus 3-axle MCW Metrobus MkII (11 m) In 1981, MCW produced prototypes of 3-axle, 12-metre long \\"Super-Metrobuses\\". Two were purchased by CMB as ML1-ML2 and three by Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) as M1-M3, later renumbered 3M1-3M3. All were bodied with MCW MkII bodies. CMB purchased a further 82 (ML3-84) between 1983 and 1988, while KMB purchased 80 2-axle Metrobuses (M1-M80, with MkII bodies) between 1983 and 1985. While KMB was not interested in the 12-metre version Super-Metrobuses, they did express their interest in an 11-metre 3-axle version (the CMB 11-metre version Metrobuses were 2-axle) with 254 11-metre 3-axle Metrobuses (S3M1-254) purchased between 1986 and 1989. Fifty of these buses were fitted with Cummins engines, and another one (later numbered S3M145) was originally fitted with a prototype air-conditioner, but this proved unreliable and was subsequently removed. Between 1987 and 1989, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) also purchased 59 2-axle Metrobuses for their feeder bus services. 39 of them (101-139) were brand new with MkII bodies, while another 20 (140-159) were second-hand buses purchased from South Yorkshire PTE with MkI bodies. Argos Bus purchased 6 Metrobuses for their non-franchised routes and private hire services between 1988 and 1989. They were from the same batch as those bought second-hand by KCRC. KMB purchased eight further 2-axle Metrobuses (M81-M88) in 1989. These buses were fitted with Cummins LTA10-B282 (282 hp) engines and Voith D864G 4-speed gearbox, and were used on the hilly KMB Route 51 (between Tsuen Wan and Kam Tin, climbing Tai Mo Shan along its way). Later KMB fitted some of its older Metrobuses with Cummins engines, in order to avoid excess damage to buses running the hilly route. = Withdrawal = The Original Tour MCW Super Metrobus 12 m MkII in London in June 2011 The MkI second-hand Metrobuses were the first to be withdrawn, and all of them have now been scrapped. Many of the KCRC ones were loaned to Citybus for few years before final withdrawal. CMB removed its MC-class Metrobuses from the luxury routes after introducing Dennis Darts for the service in 1991, preserving the seating layout. These Metrobuses were allocated to non-luxury routes in the Southern District, Hong Kong, as well as route 13 serving the \\"Mid-levels\\". Although CMB was the first to introduce Metrobuses, it withdrew only 3 of them (all were accident victims) before the end of its franchise in August 1998. Its earliest Metrobuses were 20 years old at that time. New World First Bus purchased all the remaining CMB Metrobuses and Super-Metrobuses when it took over most of the CMB routes, and converted 3 MC-class Metrobuses to training buses. In 2000, the last of the MCW Metrobuses were de-registered, briefly exported to The Original Tour, Big Bus Tours or Australia. Some of the MCW Metrobuses were brought back to The Original Tour in the year 2006. As of 2013, the last of the examples from United Kingdom were withdrawn. KMB allocated its 3 Super-Metrobuses to the New Territories for many years. For example, they were serving on route 61A (which connected Tuen Mun and Yuen Long new towns) right before the KCR Light Rail took over the services. After that, they were seen on route 36A (which connected a public housing estate in Kwai Chung to a ferry pier) until the route's decline in the mid-1990s. They spent a few further years as spare buses before being withdrawn from passenger service in 1996 and converted to training buses. They were finally sold and scrapped in 2001. KMB started to withdraw its 2-axle Metrobuses in 1997. Some of them had their chassis damaged due to the fatigue caused during their service on the Tai Mo Shan KMB Route 51, which climbed to the highest altitude achievable by buses in Hong Kong. These were withdrawn by 2003. The 11-metre 3-axle Metrobuses in KMB were not withdrawn until summer 2002. KCRC also started to withdraw their Mark II Metrobuses in the early 2000s. The last 2-axle Metrobus in Hong Kong (KCRC 134) was withdrawn in October 2005. The last Metrobus in Hong Kong KMB fleet number S3M233, license no. EH8559) ceased operation on 8 May 2007. As of mid-2011, no more Metrobuses were licensed and in use in Hong Kong.  End of production  Production of the Metrobus ceased in 1989 with the financial collapse of MCW. The last Metrobus built was West Midlands Travel 3124(G124FJW), it had a message from the builders stating that it was the last one built by MCW and signed by the staff on the inside of the roof. The Metrobus design was purchased by Optare in 1990, which had recently joined the United Bus group with DAF Bus.Metrobus future sealed Commercial Motor 12 October 1989 Despite owning design and production rights, the two companies heavily reworked the design to produce a new vehicle, the DAF DB250 based Optare Spectra, which was launched in 1991 and ceased production in late 2005.

Starring Samy Naceri, Fr√©d√©ric Diefenthal and Marion Cotillard, it is the sequel to Taxi 2, and was followed by Taxi 4. Plot A group of thieves calling themselves the Santa Claus gang are wreaking havoc, using Santa Claus costumes to commit heists, and the Marseille police are, as usual, unable to keep up. Superintendent Gibert (played by Bernard Farcy) is distracted by a Chinese journalist (Bai Ling) writing a story on his squad, and is unable to stop the robbers. Detective Emilien's wife, Petra, has just announced that she's pregnant and taxi driver Daniel (Samy Naceri) is in the midst of a relationship crisis. His long suffering girlfriend Lilly has walked out on him after finding him customising his taxi at four o'clock in the morning, and complaining that their house has become a mere garage and how Daniel stopped paying attention to her. After a string of mistakes in which the thieves outsmart the police time and time again, the journalist is kidnapped. It is revealed that the journalist is the leader of the Santa Claus gang. The police go in search, but Emilien is captured after another botched attempt to arrest them. The journalist sets a trap; she leaves Emilien tied to a chair in an old warehouse, directly in the path of a giant ball which will crush him five minutes later. At the very last moment, Daniel rushes in with his taxi and rescues him. They track the gang to their hideout in the Swiss mountains, where the journalist and her accomplices are arrested by a crack team of Alpine troops. Gibert lands in an ice-bound lake after leaping from an aircraft with them. Petra gives birth, Daniel proposes to Lilly and a Gibert is seen being pushed around in a wheelchair covered in ice.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Gortynia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipal unit has an area of 110.759 km2. Dimitsana is built on the ruins of the ancient town Teuthis. The population of the village is 342 (2011 census), while it was 611 in 2001. It has been registered as a traditional settlement. Dimitsana is built on a mountain slope at an elevation of 950 meters. From its southern side a marvelous view of Megalopolis plain and Taygetus is provided. Dimitsana is located 53 km east of Pyrgos, 31 km northwest of Tripoli, 23 km northwest of Megalopoli and 17 km northeast of Andritsaina. The village has a school, a historical library, several churches, a post office, an open-air water-power museum,Piraeus Bank Group Cultural Foundation description of the museum an open amphitheater, hotels and a square. History Moni Philosophou Old houses At the site of present-day Dimitsana there was, in ancient times, the ancient Arcadian town Teuthis that had participated in the Trojan War, but also in the colonization of Megalopolis. In 963 Philosophou Monastery was founded 2,5 km from Dimitsana. The name of the town is first recorded in 967 in a Patriarchate's document related to Philosophou Monastery. The first gunpowder mills of the town were built under the guise of home industry in the middle of the 18th century by Bishop Ananias Lakedaimonias, who paved a revolt against the Turks. In 1764 the movement was revealed and Ananias and his partners were killed. In the same year Agapios, a wise monk, built a library, where he moved the books of the monastery. The library was growing up constantly until 1821, as the Patriarchate offered new books and there was operating a seminary, known as Œ¶œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒø ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ (Tuition Centre of Greek Literature). A lot of bishops and scholars graduated from it, among them Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople and Germanos III of Old Patras whose houses have survived in the town. After the Orlov events, some inhabitants of Dimitsana bearing the name \\"Tasoulis\\" () migrated to Minor Asia fleeing the Albanian ravaging of Peloponnese.Œ£Œ¨Œ∏Œ±œÇ ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ, Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨œÇ.

For this reason Dimitsana has been called \\"the Nation's powder keg\\". In 1960 Dimitsana's population was about 2,000, but a lot of people have since then immigrated to the United States, Australia and elsewhere. Sights Dimitsana is a stone-built village with remarkable mansions, most of which are now restored. It is a typical sample of Gortynia's architecture and it is registered as a traditional one. The statue of Patriarch Gregory V dominates in the central square and also the family houses of both him and Germanos III of Old Patras can be seen. Dimitsana's Library contains today about 35,000 books, manuscripts and documents. In Dimitsana's Museum, housed in the Library, there are collections of weaving, looms and handicrafts and an archaeological one. The Elementary School was built 1898‚Äì1910, by a donation of Andreas Syngros, and is a characteristic sample of that period. It operated as a girls' school until 1930 and later as county court. Not far from the village is the Open-air Water Power Museum (1997), created by restoration of abandoned pre-industrial facilities, based on the Water Power. It includes a flourmill, a traditional cauldron, a tannery, a tanner's house and a gunpowder mill.

It is a mycoheterotrophic herb that spends most of its life under the soil surface, its flowers only sometimes appearing a few millimetres about ground level. Description Rhizanthella slateri is a leafless, sympodial herb with a branching, whitish, underground stem up to long and about in diameter with prominent overlapping bracts. The stem is often branched with up to four flowering heads. The heads are up to in diameter and have up to thirty tube-shaped, purplish flowers surrounded by whitish, triangular floral bracts up to long. The dorsal sepal is curved with a thread-like tip and has a broad base that forms a hood over the column and the lateral sepals, sometimes protruding above the floral bracts. The petals are about half as long as the lateral sepals. The labellum is thick, tongue-like, heart-shaped and covered with fine, pimply papillae. The column is short and broad with narrow \\"wings\\". Flowering occurs in October and November with the heads maturing below the soil surface or up to above ground level. Taxonomy and naming The eastern underground orchid was first formally described in 1932 by Herman Rupp and given the name Cryptanthemis slateri in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales from specimens collected near Bulahdelah in 1931. In 1985, Mark Clements and Phillip Cribb changed the name to Rhizanthella slateri. The specific epithet (slateri) honours Ernest William Slater who discovered the species. Distribution and habitat Rhizanthella slateri grows in forest, usually under a deep layer of organic litter. It is known from populations in the Buladelah area, the Watagan Mountains, Blue Mountains, Dharug National Park and near Nowra, each population only known from a few individuals. Records from the Lamington Plateau in Queensland are now recognised as R. omissa. Conservation status This underground orchid is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"vulnerable\\" under the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The Bulahdelah population in the Great Lakes Local Government Area is listed as \\"endangered\\". That population was threatened by the building of a new highway, but a small diversion saved some individuals and some were able to be relocated.

Biography =Early life= Joseph Clement was born on 13 June 1779 at Great Asby in Westmorland, the son of a hand-loom weaver. Although he was taught to read and write at the local school, he learned mechanics and natural history from his father, Thomas, who had built himself a lathe. He worked, first as a weaver, then as a slater, and learned metalwork from the local blacksmith. With these skills, he built himself his own lathe, on which he turned woodwind musical instruments, which he then learned to play. By 1805 he was making looms at a factory in Kirkby Stephen, then moved first to Carlisle, then to Glasgow where he learned draughtsmanship from Peter Nicholson. By 1812 he was with Leys, Masson & Co. in Aberdeen, where he attended lectures in natural philosophy at Marischal College. Career In 1813, he moved to London, first working for Alexander Galloway, pp. 57-58. in Holborn. He soon left in search of wages more suiting his skills, moving to Joseph Bramah at Pimlico. Bramah doubled the wages Galloway had paid and entered into a formal agreement with Clement for a term of five years, dated 1 April 1814, making him chief draughtsman and superintendent of Bramah's Pimlico works., p. 58. Following Bramah's death, Clement took up a position as chief draughtsman at Maudslay, Sons and Field, in Lambeth, where he played a role in the design of the firm's early marine steam engines. In 1817 he left Maudslay and Field to set up his own firm, encouraged by the Duke of Northumberland, a frequent visitor to Maudslay's works. Clement had managed to save the sum of ¬£500 and took a small workshop at 21 Prospect Place, Newington, where he set up in business as a draughtsman and manufacturer of precision machinery. In 1818 he was awarded the gold medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts for his invention of a machine for marking ellipses, inspired by the trammels used by carpenters. Clement's main interest was the improvement of self-acting machine tools, and especially lathes. He introduced various improvements in the construction of lathes, being awarded the gold Isis medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts in 1827 for his improved lathe which was of unprecedented precision and accuracy. The next year he added his self-adjusting centre chuck to the lathe, for which the Society of Arts awarded him their silver medal. The same year (1828), Clement began making fluted screw-cutting tap and dies, p. 59. and urged the adoption of a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards played a major role in such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws., p. 10. Regarding Clement's building of planers, Roe (1916), p. 52. says, :Clement made his first planer in 1820 [‚Ä¶]. Some years later he built his \\"great planer,\\" a remarkable machine from both a mechanical and a financial standpoint. A very full description of it was given by Mr. Varley in the \\"Transactions of the Society of Arts\\" in London in 1832, illustrated by a set of copper plates made from Clement's own drawings. Clement's reputation of being the most expert draftsman of his day is well borne out by these drawings. [‚Ä¶] It was fitted with centers and was used for planing circular, spiral and conical work as well as flat work. It took in work 6 feet square and was hand-driven. [‚Ä¶] For more than ten years it was the only one of its size and it ran for many years night and day on jobbing work, its earnings forming Clement's principal income. =Involvement with Charles Babbage= The recognised excellence of Clement's machine tools and his skill in precision engineering led to him being employed by Charles Babbage in 1823 to work on his project to design and build his mechanical calculating device, the difference engine. The high prices of his large precision tools led to a falling out with Babbage (at the time workmen were allowed to keep any tools made by them in the course of their work), but his skill and the quality of his products kept him in employment for many years. =Later years= In later years, Clement returned to music and constructed an organ. He died on 28 February 1844 at 31 St George's Road, Southwark. Although he had never married, he had a daughter, Sarah Clement, by one Agnes Esson from County Durham.

It lasted 17 hours and raced from South Dakota through southern Michigan before dying out over Western Pennsylvania. South Dakota Map of the Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991 (courtesy of NOAA) This derecho started in southeastern South Dakota at around 8 A.M. CDT. Iowa The derecho moved into northern Iowa causing more damage. Thousands of acres of corn and soybean crops were flattened causing $60 million in damage (1991 dollars).The strongest wind gust‚Äî103 mph (170 km/h) -- was recorded at Sioux Center, Iowa. A school's roof was blown off in Orange City. A gust of 71 mph was recorded at Mason City airport. There was also major damage inside the city. A woman was killed in McIntosh Woods State Park when a tree fell on her. Wisconsin As this derecho moved into Wisconsin in the early afternoon hours, it died out and a new derecho quickly developed. The derecho quickly gained in size and was once again causing damage. Thirty farm buildings were destroyed and over 250 were damaged over southern Wisconsin. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, a 300-year-old Dunbar Oak tree was toppled. Dane, Jefferson, Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee counties were declared Federal Disaster Areas by FEMA. Southern Michigan The derecho entered southern Michigan at around 6:30 P.M. EDT. It would move at up to 60 mph, and knock out power to nearly 853,000 customers. Up to this time this would be the largest number of customers in Michigan to lose power from the same storm system. For some customers it would take up to a week for the power to be restored. An 84 mph (133 km/h) wind gust was reported at Grand Rapids, Michigan and at Belding, Michigan. A semi-trailer was blown over on I-69 near Marshall. Also, an F1 tornado touched down in Rochester, Michigan. Southwestern Ontario After crossing lower Michigan, the derecho moved into the Windsor area of Ontario around 9:30pm EDT. Many electrical lines were blown down and a number of roofs were damaged. A tornado touched down near Stratford and numerous funnel clouds were reported. Demise The bow echo system then crossed over Lake Erie and dissipated over Western Pennsylvania (including metro Pittsburgh) at around 2 A.M. EDT on July 8. The Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991 traveled about 1000 miles (1600 km) in 17 hours, caused $100 million in damage (1991 dollars), cut off electrical power to nearly 1 million customers, killed 1 and injured about 12 others.

Cognitive disorders are commonly coincident. CIPA is the fourth type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), and is also known as HSAN IV. Signs and symptoms Signs of CIPA are present from infancy. Infants may present with seizures related to hyperthermia. Because people with this condition are unable to sweat, they are unable to regulate their body temperature. Those affected are unable to feel pain and temperature.. Lack of pain puts those with CIPA at a high risk for accidental self-mutilation. Corneal ulceration occurs due to lack of protective impulses. Joint and bone problems are common due to repeated injuries, and wounds heal poorly. Cause CIPA is caused by a genetic mutation which prevents the formation of nerve cells which are responsible for transmitting signals of pain, heat, and cold to the brain. The disorder is autosomal recessive. It is caused by a mutation in NTRK1, a gene encoding the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor. NTRK1 is a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). This protein induces outgrowth of axons and dendrites and promotes the survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. The mutation in NTRK1 does not allow NGF to bind properly, causing defects in the development and function of nociceptive reception. Mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle cells have been found in people with CIPA. Skin biopsies show a lack of innervation of the eccrine glands and nerve biopsies show a lack of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed with genetic testing.  Treatment  There is no treatment for CIPA. Attention to injuries to prevent infection and worsening is necessary.  Epidemiology  The condition is inherited and is most common among Negev Arabs aka Negev Bedouins.Approximately 20% of people with CIPA die of hyperthermia by age 3.

History The state purchased land for the park in 1969 using funds supplied through the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. At the same time, the North Beach unit was leased from Utah Power and Light. Management of the north unit continues under lease from PacifiCorp. Wildlife This state park is home to bonneville cisco, cutthroat trout, moose, pelicans, lake trout, deer, cranes and cougar. Features Bear Lake owes its unique turquoise blue color to the presence of suspended calcium carbonate (limestone). The park's two units each have a beach over in length with gradually sloping lake bottom and large swimming area. Camping is offered in the east unit. In winter, the park provides ice fishing access for the annual runs of Bonneville cisco.

A spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office, estimated that 300,000 residences had lost electricity, 7 persons died and 80 were injured. Syracuse Labor Day derecho NEXRAD radar animation of the Syracuse Labor Day derecho The northernmost derecho (dubbed the Syracuse Labor Day Derecho and referred to locally as the Labor Day Storm), got its start in northwestern New York just before midnight on September 7 after several thunderstorm cells coming from Ontario converged to become a bow echo. It quickly moved southeastward through New York. = Impacts = Aerial view of St. Lucy Catholic church in the downtown Syracuse after the Derecho. Some of the worst damage occurred at Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica. Three people were killed, two of them at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse. Governor George Pataki declared nine counties in that region to be in a state of emergency, which meant that the state would provide financial and other resources to those counties if help was requested. An wind gust was recorded at the Greater Rochester International Airport and a gust was recorded at the Syracuse airport. Winds peaked at an estimated by radars. Tens of thousands of trees were blown down. Embedded within this derecho was a supercell thunderstorm, which produced an extensive damage path from the Syracuse area, through the northern suburbs of Albany, and into western Vermont. Lightning with this particular storm was reported by many in its path as extreme, creating twilight conditions in Rochester, and daylight conditions on its rampage down the Mohawk Valley. The constant lightning was striking as many as 10‚Äì20 times per second. Damage was estimated at $130 million. Many in the region were without electricity for over a week. Many people had to go to temporary shelters because of damage to their homes. The St. Lucy Catholic church in the downtown Syracuse lost one of its steeples. New York City Labor Day derecho Radar loop of the derecho through PA, NY, NJ and CT. As the Syracuse Derecho moved into New England, a new derecho started developing in southeastern Michigan at around 4 A.M. EDT and followed a track just to the south of the first one. The derecho raced through northeastern Ohio and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and ended up in New York in the mid-afternoon hours. = Impacts = Four people were killed and 62 were injured, mainly in the New Jersey and the New York City area, but damage also extended east to Long Island and Southwestern Connecticut. Damage was particularly heavy in Union County, where the towns of Plainfield, Cranford, Clark and Rahway declared a state of emergency, imposed overnight curfews and postponed the opening day of school. Four small tornadoes were spawned by this storm, including an F2 tornado in Lynbrook, New York, that caused 6 injuries and $1 million in damage. Officials said that some 19,500 customers in the city and Westchester County were without power, roughly 71,500 on Long Island, 77,000 in New Jersey, and 10,000 in southern Connecticut. Thousands of trees were blown down and about 100 boats were overturned.

However, it was still an era when women artists were given little credibility and it wasn't until 1932 that Heward's first solo exhibition came at the Scott Gallery in Montreal. Wanting to refine her skills, and drawn to the great gathering of creative genius in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France, between 1925 and 1926 Prudence Heward lived and painted in Paris. While studying at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, she frequented Le Dome Caf√© in Montparnasse, the favorite haunt of North American writers and artists and the place where Canadian writer Morley Callaghan came with his friends Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. While in Paris, Heward met Ontario painter Isabel McLaughlin with whom she became friends and upon her return to Canada, would join with her and other artists on nature painting trips. In 1929 her career got a major boost when her painting, Girl on a Hill, won the top prize in the Governor General Willingdon competition organized by the National Gallery of Canada. She was invited to exhibit with the Group of Seven and through it became friends with A. Y. Jackson with whom she would go on sketching excursions along the Saint Lawrence River. She did a number of landscapes, with a particular attachment for Quebec's Eastern Townships. She joined the executive committee of The Atelier: A School of Drawing Painting Sculpture in 1931. During the Second World War she designed war posters. In 1933, Prudence Heward co-founded the Canadian Group of Painters, but her struggle with asthma and other health problems eventually slowed her down. A 1939 automobile accident curtailed her abilities further but she still produced some outstanding portraits until 1945 when her health had deteriorated to the point where she had to give up painting. She died two years later, while seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles, California. Works The Immigrants, Prudence Heward, 1929, Private Collection, Toronto Though Heward also painted landscapes and still lifes, she was primarily a painter of human subjects. As Julia Skelly points out in Prudence Heward: Life & Work, Heward preferred the term ‚Äúfigures‚Äù to portraits, and most of her figurative paintings are of women who often return the viewer‚Äôs gaze, and who are \\"realistically rendered rather than unrealistically idealized.\\" These include nude subjects which was sometimes controversial in the 1930s. Art historian Charmaine Nelson has critically examined Heward‚Äôs depictions of black women she painted. Her work was influenced by schools of European modernism and her application of these principles and styles was more than merely formal. They provided her \\"with a dynamic visual vocabulary for depicting modern Canadian women in both rural and urban contexts.\\" Today, works by Prudence Heward can be found in several Canadian galleries including the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Montr√©al Museum of Fine Arts, the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec and at the National Gallery of Canada. In 1996, her cousin, politician Heward Grafftey, wrote \\"Chapter Four: Prudence Heward\\" for the book Portraits of a Life. On July 2, 2010, Canada Post released a commemorative stamp and a souvenir sheet in honour of Heward as part of its Art Canada collection. The two paintings featured were At the Theatre (1928) and Rollande (1929).Canada Post, Details/en d√©tail, vol. 19, no. 3 (July to September 2010), p. 6. References  Further reading  Julia Skelly.

Life and work Laura Adeline Muntz was born at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England in 1860, but her family emigrated to Canada when she was a child. She grew up on a farm in the Muskoka District of Ontario. As a young woman, Muntz\`s interest in art led to her take lessons in painting from William Charles Forster of Hamilton and to live and work at his school. Starting in 1882, she began to take classes at the Ontario School of Art where she studied with Lucius Richard O'Brien, and later with George Agnew Reid. She studied briefly at the South Kensington School of Art in 1887, then returned to Canada to continue her studies with Reid. In 1891, she embarked on a seven-year period of study in Paris, attending the renowned Acad√©mie Colarossi. Her preferred subject was children. From 1893 on, her handling of paint was impressionist. Her work was exhibited in various exhibitions, resulting in some works being reproduced in periodicals, growing prestige and successful sales. To stretch her limited financial resources, she gave private English lessons, and shared an apartment with the American painter, Wilhelmina Hawley (1860-1958). Hawley likely taught Muntz her watercolour technique, and they travelled together to Rijsoord in the southern Netherlands where they painted. At one point while she was in Paris, the unmarried Muntz was called home from a triumphant year abroad to look after an ailing relative. Upon her return, in 1896, at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, in recognition of her diligence and talent, Muntz was made massi√®re or studio head. On her return to Canada in 1898, she set up a studio in Toronto and began to teach and paint. In the decade at the beginning of the new century, she was said to be the artist with the greatest versatility among women painters because she painted such a wide variety of subjects. When, in 1906, she moved to Montreal to continue her career at 6 Beaver Hall Square, she reached a sizable new audience that regarded her as the premier Canadian portraitist of children. Her work received recognition both in Canada and beyond. Muntz exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, and then in 1894 as part of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in Paris. She continued to exhibit at many international exhibitions following her return from Paris, and her work was recognized with a silver medal at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. She was subsequently awarded a bronze medal at the 1904 St Louis World Fair Exposition. She showed 27 paintings with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts between 1893 and 1929. Her work was frequently compared and contrasted with that of her contemporary and friend Florence Carlyle. She was elected as an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1896, only the eighth woman to receive this honour. Muntz was a member of the Ontario Society of Artists starting in 1891; she was the first woman appointed to its Executive Council in 1899, serving until 1903. In 1909, she was invited to exhibit with the Canadian Art Club; she was the only woman so invited. Following the death of her sister in 1915, she returned to Toronto and married her brother-in-law Charles W.B. Lyall to care for the children of her sister's marriage (there were 11 of them but only a few remained at home). She then set a studio up in the attic of their home, and started signing her works with her married name. In 1921, she travelled with her husband to Devon, England and there painted what was new scenery for her. Critics praise her handling of light and restrained though rich colour, proof that she could have been a major landscape painter if she chose. In 1930, Muntz was ill and dying of Exophthalmic Goitre brought on partly by overwork and worry about the family responsibilities she had assumed fifteen years earlier. Despite these trying personal circumstances, she continued to paint until her death in 1930. Lyall is interred in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto.Find A Grave, Laura Muntz Lyall Collections Both the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario include her work in their holdings.

Gabrielle with Rose, Pierre- Auguste Renoir, 1911. Gabrielle Renard (August 1, 1878 ‚Äì February 26, 1959) was a French woman who became an important member of the family of the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, first becoming their nanny, and subsequently a frequent model for the artist. The bond she developed with the Renoirs' second son, the future filmmaker Jean Renoir, lasted throughout their lives. Upon her marriage in 1921, she became Gabrielle Renard-Slade. Early life Born in Essoyes in the Aube of France, she was a cousin of Aline Victorine Charigot Renoir, who had married the painter, Pierre-Auguste. The village was the birthplace of Aline also. At age sixteen, Gabrielle Renard moved to Montmartre to live and work as a nanny in her cousin's household, where the second of the three Renoir sons was about to be born. Renard became the subject of a number of Renoir's portraits, many of her with the children. The Renoir family Gabrielle Renard developed a strong bond with the infant, Jean Renoir, that would last throughout their lives. She introduced him to the Guignol puppet shows that were held in the Montmartre. Gabrielle was fascinated by the newly invented motion picture, and when Jean Renoir was only a few years old, she took him to see his first film. He became a renowned film maker. During the final years of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's life he suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, but continued to paint with her help. When the family moved to a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer near the Mediterranean coast, seeking a better climate for Renoir's arthritis, Gabrielle moved with them. While he worked in the studio at \\"Les Collettes,\\" Gabrielle would place the paint brush between his crippled fingers. Marriage Devoted to her cousin's family, Gabrielle Renard did not marry until 1921, when the Renoir children were grown. Her husband, Conrad Hensler Slade (1871‚Äì1955), was an aspiring painter from a wealthy American family. They had a son whom they named Jean Slade. The United States Following the occupation of France by the Germans during World War II, Gabrielle and her family moved to the United States, her husband's native country. Jean Renoir also moved to the United States during the war. Being a successful film director, he settled in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. When Gabrielle's husband died in 1955, she moved to Beverly Hills to be near Jean Renoir. Death Gabrielle Renard-Slade died at her home in Beverly Hills in 1959. In his memoirs, My Life and My Films, Jean Renoir begins and ends his book with discussion of Gabrielle Renard, and, throughout the autobiography, he recounts the profound influence Gabrielle had upon his life. He wrote, \\"She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes\\", and he concluded with the words he said he had often spoken as a child, \\"Wait for me, Gabrielle\\".

She was a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters. Early life Savage was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the daughter of John Savage, a wealthy industrialist. She grew up in what was then the rural area of Dorval, Quebec, and spent her summers at the family cottage in the Laurentian mountains, where she developed a love of her surroundings that became a source of inspiration for her art. She studied at the High School of Montreal. Artistic career Between 1914 and 1918, Savage studied art at the Art Association of Montreal under several instructors including William Brymner (1855‚Äì1925) and Maurice Cullen. Her private world was permanently changed when her beloved twin brother was killed in action in France during World War I. After the end of the war, Savage went to Minneapolis, Minnesota where she studied design at the Minneapolis School of Art. On her return to Montreal, she took a job as an art teacher at Baron Byng High School where she would remain for 26 years (1922-1947). In addition, she taught art courses to children, promoting their early exposure to the field and years later was able to see the formation of the Child Art Council in Quebec, later known as the Quebec Society for Education through Art. In 1921, Savage joined the Beaver Hall Hill Group whose painters were closely allied to the Group of Seven. A. Y. Jackson, a member of the Group of Seven would become Savage's lifelong close friend. After spending some time at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto with the painter Arthur Lismer, another member of the Group of Seven, Savage traveled to Europe where some of her works were exhibited. Savage also spent time in British Columbia and did sketches of native villages on the northwest coast; this work was displayed in 1927 at the National Gallery in the exhibition \\"Canadian West Coast Art, Native and Modern\\". In 1933, she was one of the founding members of the Canadian Group of Painters and in 1949 and 1960 would serve as its president. She was appointed supervisor of art for the Protestant School Board of Montreal in 1948. She was instrumental in the founding of the High School Art Teaching Association and in 1955 inspired the formation of the Child Art Council which became the Quebec Society for Education through Art. Savage retired from full-time teaching in 1953 and was named the Supervisor of Art for the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. She was then invited by McGill University to teach, where she ended up teaching between 1954 and 1959. Throughout her life, Savage spoke out about gender inequity. Death Savage died in Montreal in 1971 and was interred there in the Mount Royal Cemetery. The Anne Savage Archives can be found at Montreal's Concordia University.

The term is finding its way into business, both in advertising and internal communications. When a politician repeats the same thing ad nauseam, or uses a question on one subject as a launching point to talk about a different subject, he or she is said to be exercising message discipline. Message discipline may involve a subordination of irrelevant personal opinions, or a subordination of fluctuating desires to say what others want to hear versus maintaining an unwavering devotion to the message as it reaches out to greater numbers of potential audience members. Message discipline is often practiced around wedge issues. Devolving to talking points (practicing message discipline) around issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion rights can be a powerful weapon in the politician's arsenal, either clouding a difficult line of questioning from an interviewer, or motivating the candidates' base to vote. Key to defining wedge issues and practicing message discipline are the selection of terms that low-information voters will rally around. In a business context, message discipline is the practice of reducing and managing the number of messages going from headquarters and marketing functions to field organizations as well as front-line employees. This goal-oriented, structured, strategic communication, is believed to drive operational excellence in organizations, as it reduces the clutter and mixed messages that sometimes afflict communications through organizational layers. Message discipline is criticised by educated voters who see it as a method of obfuscation from what the electorate sees as important. Overly simplistic and repeated communications of the message is seen as dumbing down and can meet with cynicism of the electorate.

Biography L√©on Ernest Gaumont, born in Paris was gifted with a mechanical mind which led him to employment manufacturing precision instruments. From early childhood, he was fascinated by the technique of photography. When he was offered a job at the Comptoir g√©neral de photographie in 1893, he jumped at the opportunity. His decision proved fortunate when two years later he was given the chance to acquire the business. In August 1895, he partnered with the astronomer Joseph Vallot, the famous engineer Gustave Eiffel, and the financier Alfred Besnier to make the purchase. Their business entity, called L. Gaumont et Cie, has survived in one form or another to become the world's oldest surviving film company extant. The company logo was the distinctive \\"Marguerite\\" (named after his mother), a type of flower similar to the daisy. The company had extensive studios (Cit√© Elg√©) in the Buttes-Chaumont District of Paris, and a smaller operation in Nice, France. Leon Gaumont was married to Camille Louise Maillard (1860-1933)on June 4th, 1888. They had five children: Charles, Jeanne, Raymond, Helene, and Louis. L√©on Gaumont's company sold camera equipment and film, but in 1897 inaugurated a motion picture production business. Initially, Gaumont made films for the picture arcade business such as those operated by the Lumi√®re brothers, but it was under the direction of Alice Guy (Gaumont's secretary - First Woman Film Director), that they began making short films based on narrative scripts. Louis Feuillade (Judex, Les Vampires, Fantomas) was to follow as the Studio Director when Guy left for Fort, Lee, New Jersey in 1912, where she subsequently opened her own production company‚ÄîSolax Studios‚Äî and it was then that Gaumont rapidly expanded the business into cinematographic equipment for amateurs. Within a few years, Gaumont's company ranked second only to Path√© Fr√®res in the field of French Cinema. In 1903, Gaumont was granted patents for his Chronophonographe and loudspeaker system designed to work with his sound-on- disc talking pictures: the chronophone. The Etablissements Gaumont was founded in 1906 to handle film production and distribution, plus to operate a chain of movie theaters, including the giant Gaumont Palace (1911) (Place Clichy - former \\"Hippodrome) in Paris (largest in the world at the time - 6,000 seats). By 1910 L√©on Gaumont had improved his synchronous sound invention to the point where he was able to provide enough volume to be heard by up to 4000 people in a theater. In 1912, Gaumont developed a color process for film. 1930's Gaumont Kalee film Projector, Cinema Museum London One of the two dominant forces (after Charles Path√©, in film in all of Europe, World War I profoundly affected Leon Gaumont's business fortunes (over 300 employees were drafted, Nitrate Emulsion film stocks dwindled because of the need for nitro-cellulous in the munitions industry); nevertheless, before retiring in 1930, he had built one of the most important film companies in cinema history. Upon his retirement to Provence, a restructuring of corporate ownership took place through financing provided by the Banque Nationale de Cr√©dit and with a capital stock issue in the name of a new company called Gaumont-Franco-Film- Aubert (GFFA). Four years later, a scandal erupted following the collapse of the Banque Nationale de Cr√©dit and GFFA was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. Death and legacy L√©on Gaumont died on August 9th, 1946 in Sainte-Maxime-sur-M√®r, in the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region of France, and was buried in the Cimeti√®re de Belleville in Paris. In 1995, on the 100th anniversary of French film, a commemorative silver 100 Franc coin was issued with L√©on Gaumont's image.

(There was no 6th Medium.) The 1st, 2nd and 5th Mediums served in Italy, while the 3rd, 4th, and 7th were in northwest Europe. Three of these units (1st, 4th, and 7th) were each equipped with sixteen guns, firing 100-pound shells, while the other three had guns firing 60-pound shells. Medium regiments were not part of the artillery component of the individual infantry or armoured divisions as were most field regiments (25-pounder guns) but were classed as \\"Army\\" troops and were available to support any formation which needed the fire of heavier guns. The 7th Medium Regiment was raised in September 1939 with the mobilization of four Ontario militia field artillery batteries: the 12th (London), 45th (Lindsay), 97th (Walkerton) and 100th (Listowel). In the period from then until February 1941, during which time the regiment was at Petawawa, there were a number of organizational changes from which emerged the 7th Army Field Regiment, RCA, consisting of the 12th, 45th and 97th Batteries. The 7th continued its training at Petawawa and in New Brunswick until November 1941, when it went overseas to England, where it spent over two and a half years in constant training. A major change occurred in November 1943 when the regiment was converted from Field to Medium, and gave up its 25-pounders for the much bigger 5.5 inch. In the process it became a two-battery regiment, and the 97th Battery was disbanded, most of its personnel, however, being absorbed by the other two larger batteries. The war for the 7th Medium became the real thing when it crossed the Channel in the second week in July 1944, and from then until the end of the fighting in the first week of May 1945 it took part in all the major battles and actions in which First Canadian Army was engaged: Normandy, the Seine crossing, the Channel ports (Boulogne and Calais), the Scheldt, Bergen op Zoom, Nijmegen salient, the Rhineland, the Rhine crossing, the advance through central and northern Netherlands, and finally across the Ems River into northwest Germany. The 7th Medium fired its first round in anger at Rots, near Caen, Normandy, shortly after 18:00 on 13 July 1944, and its last, also shortly after 18:00, from its last gun position at Veenheusen in Germany, a short distance from Emden, on 4 May 1945. In the course of 10 months in action, the 7th occupied about 60 gun positions, fired nearly 70,000 rounds of 100-pound shells in support of three Canadian divisions, most of the British divisions and the 1st Polish Armoured Division, all of the British 21st Army Group. The major battles in which the 7th was engaged were of course Normandy, the Scheldt and the Rhineland. The fire program for the opening of the latter is reported to have been the largest in the West during the war: at 05:00 on 8 February 1945, 1,400 British and Canadian guns of all calibres opened fire at once in support of the British XXX Corps, consisting for the opening of the battle of four British divisions and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacking east from Nijmegen into Germany. Included in the preliminary bombardment, which ended at 09:30, were 16 medium regiments (13 Royal Artillery and three Royal Canadian Artillery. This was followed at 10:00 by the 2¬Ω-hour barrage in support of XXX Corps infantry attacking into Germany. In the ten months in which the 7th Medium was in action it had 124 casualties, of which 35 were killed and 89 wounded (some of the latter returned to the unit on recovery). In Normandy, during Operation Totalize, on August 8, 1944, a group of American bombers dropped their ordnance right on top of the 7th medium regiment, 12th battery, Royal Canadian Artillery. \\"The great problem on our side was road space, and it was while waiting in our gun positions, still firing at the retreating German forces, that the first disaster of the campaign befell us. A flight of American Fortresses flying high over 12th Battery area unloaded their bomb load right on top of the battery and on a nearby ammunition depot. B troop received most of the damage and Lt. J.E. Clark and ten other ranks were killed or died of wounds shortly afterwards.

Chares constructed the Colossus of Rhodes in 282 BC, an enormous bronze statue of the sun god Helios and also the patron god of Rhodes. The statue was built to commemorate Rhodes' victory over the invading Macedonians in 305 BC, led by Demetrius I, son of Antigonus, a general under Alexander the Great. Also attributed to Chares was a colossal head which was brought to Rome and dedicated by P. Lentulus Spinther on the Capitoline Hill, in 57 BC (Pliny, Natural History XXXIV.18). The Colossus of Rhodes is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and was considered Chares's greatest accomplishment, until its destruction in an earthquake in 226 BC. It is believed that Chares did not live to see his project finished. There are several legends stating that he committed suicide. In one tale he had almost finished the statue when someone pointed out a small flaw in the construction. The sculptor was so ashamed of it he killed himself. In another version, the Rhodians asked Chares how much he would charge for a statue fifty feet high, and when he answered, asked him how much for a statue twice as big; he answered twice as much ‚Äì and they awarded the contract; he had overlooked that doubling the height would mean an eightfold increase in the amount of materials needed. This drove him to bankruptcy and eventually suicide.Sextus Empiricus, Against the Logicians 1.107-8; a much later work by a philosopher, not a historian.

The bathtub curve is widely used in reliability engineering. It describes a particular form of the hazard function which comprises three parts: *The first part is a decreasing failure rate, known as early failures. *The second part is a constant failure rate, known as random failures. *The third part is an increasing failure rate, known as wear- out failures. The name is derived from the cross-sectional shape of a bathtub: steep sides and a flat bottom. The bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rate of early \\"infant mortality\\" failures when first introduced, the rate of random failures with constant failure rate during its \\"useful life\\", and finally the rate of \\"wear out\\" failures as the product exceeds its design lifetime. In less technical terms, in the early life of a product adhering to the bathtub curve, the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted. In the mid-life of a product‚Äîgenerally speaking for consumer products‚Äîthe failure rate is low and constant. In the late life of the product, the failure rate increases, as age and wear take their toll on the product. Many electronic consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the bathtub curve. While the bathtub curve is useful, not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function; for example, if units are retired or have decreased use during or before the onset of the wear-out period, they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve. In reliability engineering, the cumulative distribution function corresponding to a bathtub curve may be analysed using a Weibull chart.

Bulk confectionery is a method of commercially dispensing multiple small units of confectionery, either in manufactured bags with a fixed number of units per container, or by the amount of mass placed in a bag. The former is typically used in vending machines, while the latter is more common in retailers that specialize in selling confectionery. Some shops allow the customer to mix multiple types of bulk confectionery in the same bag, then purchase the mixture based on the total weight. In the United States, some of these confections are called penny candy and are sold by the piece in candy, soda fountain, and five and dime stores. In Britain, this type of candy is also referred to as pick 'n' mix or penny sweets. In Sweden, bulk confectionery (\\"L√∂sgodis\\") can be found in almost every store, picked by hand. It usually often costs about $7,8 - $10 per kg depending on quantity and where the store is located. Loose candy is typically sold at kiosks, grocery stores and candy stores in the way that the customer picks up whatever kind, and how much, of candy they want (typically with a scoop) into a bag by themselves. The price of the candy depends on its weight, and the weighing can be either done by the customer or the seller.  History  Bulk confectionery (Swedish L√∂sgodis) origins back to the 1930s, when Swedish agriculture began to supply the country with refined sugar and therefore made bulk confectionery possible to start selling in smaller shops. In 1984, the Swedish National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) approved that it could be sold in ordinary larger stores, given that the candy was separated from each other in small containers and also taken with a ladle, handle, or a smaller bucket. Since then it has started to spread all around the world, mostly in Europe and Asia. Even some IKEA in North America has started to sell mostly Swedish varieties but also American classics in its stores.

It is an account of the early Norwegian black metal scene, with a focus on the string of church burnings and murders that occurred in the country around 1993. A film adaptation of the book was directed by Swedish director Jonas √Ökerlund in 2018. The book has been the subject of controversy over the alleged political leanings of author Michael Moynihan, though Moynihan denies these allegations.Dundas, Zach. \\"The Notorious Michael Moynihan Publication history Lords of Chaos was originally published by Feral House in 1998 (). A second, revised edition was released in 2003 and expands the original book by fifty pages (). A German edition was published in 2002 with a respective revised edition following in 2005 (). Summary The book focuses on the scene surrounding the extreme heavy metal subgenre black metal in Norway between 1990 and 1993. The first few chapters give an outline of the progression of heavy metal from bands such as Black Sabbath, Coven and Black Widow to proto-black metal bands such as Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Celtic Frost, Sarc√≥fago, Hellhammer and Venom, and finally to the early Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. The book then details the April 1991 suicide of Mayhem frontman Per Yngve \\"Dead\\" Ohlin and the formation of a radicalized \\"inner circle\\" around √òystein \\"Euronymous\\" Aarseth, based out of his small black metal retail shop Helvete (Norwegian for \\"hell\\") in Oslo, Norway. In 1992 and 1993, members of the group became connected with a series of crimes, starting with the arson of the Fantoft stave church on June 6, 1992, although the book mentions that there had previously been a \\"small, ineffectual fire at Storeveit Church\\". Church arsons continued but with a steady decline up until 1995. (The cover of Lords of Chaos shows a \\"19th-century Swedish church in flames\\".) An interview in a Norwegian newspaper given by Burzum founder Varg \\"Count Grishnackh\\" Vikernes, also a member of the Helvete group, leads to a media outrage condemning the arsons as acts of Satanism. On August 21, 1992, B√•rd \\"Faust\\" Eithun of the band Emperor murdered a homosexual man in the Olympic Park in Lillehammer. He was subsequently convicted of this crime and sentenced to 14 years in prison (of which he served nine before being released in 2003). On August 10, 1993, Aarseth was murdered by Vikernes, who received a 21-year sentence for the murder and several cases of arson related to the church burnings. The book also mentions other cases of \\"Satanic\\" murderers, such as that of Sandro Beyer by members of the German National Socialist black metal band Absurd and Caleb Fairley in the USA. It also devotes several pages to the case of a self-styled teen militia named \\"Lords of Chaos\\" that perpetrated murder and arson in Fort Myers, Florida, in April 1996,LOC, p. 293-300 but does not mention why the title Lords of Chaos was chosen for the book. Interview passages with Varg Vikernes are spread out through several sections of the book. On Burzum.org Vikernes has said he would not use the term \\"Nazi\\" any longer as self- descriptor; however, the statement is ambiguous. An interview with Vikernes about Nasjonal Samling founder Vidkun Quisling, executed in 1945 for high treason by the Norwegian government after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, is the main proof of Vikernes' admiration of him,LoC (1998): 163 and the proof of the rumor that Quisling had some influence on certain extreme strains of Norwegian black metal.\\"The World According to Quisling\\" by Gisle Tangenes, BitsofNews.com, September 19, 2006 The book presents other interviews with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, Tomas \\"Samoth\\" Haugen of Emperor, and Dani Filth of Cradle of Filth. Filth claims the existence of a \\"Satanic Gestapo\\", when he recounts an incident where he was apparently attacked on stage with a knife (which he states may have been a prop) during a concert in Germany. The authors put forward their own thesis about the reason behind the extreme music, the arsons and the cases of murder, interpreting these events as the appearance of an odinic archetype.LOC, p. 188 Within this scope, the psychologist Carl Jung is quotedLoC (1998): 176 and also a study Pathological firesetting from the year 1951.Book entry for Pathological firesetting at WorldCatLoC (1998): 81 > Satanism and the heathenism from which it ultimately descends are themselves > the products of the archetypes and differentiated psyches of nations and > peoples, and they therefore spring from the same ‚Äúoccult‚Äù or mystical > sources as nationalism itself. Nationalism is the political manifestation of > a folk‚Äôs unconscious; heathenism/Satanism is the spiritual manifestation.LoC > (1998): 314 The book goes on to compare the state sought by the commission of these violent acts with the apocalyptic Norse tale Ragnar√∂k, but states that neither radicalized black metallers nor \\"their occasional allies, the right-wing revolutionaries\\" may have found \\"the fuse on the powderkeg of alienated resentment which lies behind the fa√ßade of 20th-century civilisation\\", yet that such a \\"powderkeg\\" exists nonetheless. LOC, p. 330 Critical reaction Reviews of Lords of Chaos have been mixed, with several critics praising the book for offering an informative or at least interesting view on a relatively obscure subculture, and the book won the 1998 Firecracker Alternative Press Award.Zach Dundas. Willamette Week culture feature: \\"Lord of Chaos: ACTIVISTS ACCUSE PORTLAND WRITER AND MUSICIAN MICHAEL MOYNIHAN OF SPREADING EXTREMIST PROPAGANDA, BUT THEY'RE NOT TELLING THE WHOLE STORY. Available online: The publication was sometimes criticized for a perceived lack of distance towards its subject matter. This was considered especially alarming to groups and figures that had accused Moynihan of right-wing sympathies, charges Moynihan has denied. German online magazine Telepolis questioned Moynihan's neutrality towards the ideologies portrayed in the book, as it leaves several far-right and racist statements by interviewees such as Vikernes uncommented on and uncriticized. The author's questions during these interviews are noted to resemble \\"cue-giving\\" at times. While a reviewer for the left-oriented German newspaper Die Tageszeitung did not appreciate Moynihan earning royalties from the sales of Lords of Chaos, he still called it \\"the most thrilling non- fiction book since the Old Testament\\". Televangelist Bob Larson stated that he and Moynihan were \\"poles apart spiritually and philosophically\\", but that he respected the book as an \\"exhaustive resource regarding the seamy and Satanic side of pop music and culture\\". Journalist Kevin Coogan wrote an essay titled \\"How Black Is Black Metal?\\" in which he discusses several of the ideas purported in Lords of Chaos. Coogan considers Moynihan's personal political beliefs to be \\"at work just below the surface of a text ostensibly devoted solely to analyzing an extremist musical sub-culture\\" and ultimately counters the book's apocalyptic thesis with the conclusion that the black metal/fascism connection hangs largely \\"on a thin evidentiary thread\\", namely Varg Vikernes, who had shown extremist tendencies well before entering the scene. Coogan states that Moynihan is \\"an extreme rightist whose fusion of politics and aesthetic violence shapes a not-so-hidden sub current that runs throughout LOC\\". Coogan writes that the book itself: > ...is not a \\"fascist\\" tract in the strict sense of the term, in part because > Moynihan co-wrote the book with Didrik S√∏derlind, a former music critic for > a mainstream Norwegian paper who is now (as of 2005) an editor at Playboy. > Moreover, Feral House editor Adam Parfrey clearly wanted to publish a > popular book on the strange universe of black metal rather than a political > polemic. Moynihan, in turn, has denied Coogan's allegations. Varg Vikernes, a primary focal point of the book, has criticized the book. Vikernes states that the authors of Lords of Chaos have no \\"insight into or even good knowledge about the subjects discussed\\" and \\"don't understand one bit what Black Metal was about on 1991 and 1992\\" and that they \\"have managed to fill the heads of a generation of metal fans with lies\\". Adaptation A 2018 feature film adaptation directed by Jonas √Ökerlund premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2018, in Park City, Utah. It stars Rory Culkin and Emory Cohen in the roles of Euronymous and Varg Vikernes respectively. Jack Kilmer, Anthony De La Torre and Jonathan Barnwell appear as Dead, Hellhammer and Necrobutcher of the band Mayhem.

The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks, and was essentially an extended brainstorming session. Eleven mathematicians and scientists originally planned to attend; not all of them attended, but more than ten others came for short times.  Background  In the early 1950s, there were various names for the field of \\"thinking machines\\": cybernetics, automata theory, and complex information processing.McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004 The variety of names suggests the variety of conceptual orientations. In 1955, John McCarthy, then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines. He picked the name 'Artificial Intelligence' for the new field. He chose the name partly for its neutrality; avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory, and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback, as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive Norbert Wiener as guru or having to argue with him.Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010 In early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and Claude Shannon, a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October‚ÄìDecember, 2011, IEEE Computer Society, (citing letters, from Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Dartmouth file6, 17, 1955 etc. On September 2, 1955, the project was formally proposed by McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon. The proposal is credited with introducing the term 'artificial intelligence'. The Proposal statesMcCarthy, J., Minsky, M., Rochester, N., Shannon, C.E., A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence., http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf August, 1955 The proposal goes on to discuss computers, natural language processing, neural networks, theory of computation, abstraction and creativity (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field). retrieved 10:47 (UTC), 9th of April 2006 On May 26, 1956, McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees: For the full period: : 1) Dr. Marvin Minsky : 2) Dr. Julian Bigelow : 3) Professor D.M. Mackay : 4) Mr. Ray Solomonoff : 5) Mr. John Holland : 6) Mr. John McCarthy For four weeks: : 7) Dr. Claude Shannon : 8) Mr. Nathanial Rochester : 9) Mr. Oliver Selfridge For the first two weeks: : 10) Mr. Allen Newell : 11) Professor Herbert Simon He noted, \\"we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations. This of course is subject to change when the group gets together.\\"Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October‚ÄìDecember, 2011, IEEE Computer Society According to Stottler Henke Associates, besides the proposal's authors, attendees at the conference included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Herbert A. Simon, and Allen Newell.Stottler-Henke retrieved 18:19 (UTC), 27th of July 2006Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present, and Future (Vox of Dartmouth)The Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years The actual participants came at different times, mostly for much shorter times. Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend --- but the project was set to begin. Around June 18, 1956, the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff, maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H., to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there. Ray and Marvin stayed at Professors' apartments, but most would stay at the Hanover Inn.  Dates  The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956.Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010, P. 53 Ray Solomonoff's notes written during the Workshop, however, say it ran for roughly eight weeks, from about June 18 to August 17.

Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.More, Trenchard, 1956, http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart56more5th6thweeks.pdf  Event and aftermath  They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves, and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his/her ideas, or more frequently, a general discussion would be held. It was not a directed group research project, discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods, systems focussed on limited domains (early Expert Systems), and deductive systems versus inductive systems. One participant, Arthur Samuel said, \\"It was very interesting, very stimulating, very exciting\\".McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004. Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions.

They are known for their controversial performances and imagery. In 2001 \\"Dylan\\" briefly joined the band. Between 2003 and 2011 Mauro Pawlowski joined the band. And in 2010 and 2011 Aldo Struyf played bass in the band. Since 2012 Devos and van Kerckhoven are the sole member performing music concerts.  Club Moral 1981-1987  From 1981 until 1987 Club Moral acted as both a venue and performance band. Club Moral the venue was in Antwerp where numerous exhibitions, performances, concerts, lectures and film-shows were organized. Club Moral the band had its first performance on September 19, 1981. The show was billed as an \\"Attack\\" and took place at the event \\"Das Konzil\\", organized by Boris Nieslony in the K√ºnstlerhaus of Stuttgart, Germany. According to DDV, \\"The Club Moral 'attack' took place in a small room with no windows and all 4 walls covered with mattresses. We played very loud with heavy bass volumes. At the end of the concert people were complaining of nausea and vomiting.\\" As a venue, the first documented show at Club Moral took place June 19, 1981 and featured Etat Brut performing live with M√©canique V√©g√©tale. Club Moral continued to both perform and act as a venue through 1987. Acts that have performed at Club Moral have included Boyd Rice (NON), Michael Moynihan (Coup De Grace), Slave State, Whitehouse, Trevor Brown, Culturcide, John Duncan, Jack Stevenson and many, many more. Since 1983 they published a magazine Force Mental, of which 15 issues have appeared in print. A sixteenth issue was published on the internet in 2004 and a 'Force Mental RVSTD' facsimile edition of all issues was printed in 2010.  Club Moral 2004-Present  In 2005 Club Moral was declared dead by its founders and a War Memorial made for all those who ever performed, played or exhibited at Club Moral or contributed to Force Mental. About 300 names carved in a slab of green marble, 140 x 280 cm. The monument resides in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp). The noise band claimed to cease its activities after a performance at the Death Petrol festival in Antwerpen, Belgium; in 2006, Club Moral restructured as a new band called Bum Collar, an anagram of Club Moral with a new member: Belgian writer Paul Mennes. Bum Collar performed a number of gigs between 2006 and 2007, but in late 2007 Club Moral was resurrected for a show at De Resoor, Sint-Truiden, Belgium. The show was billed as, \\"After two years of silence Club Moral will perform on stage live again. We have abandoned our improvisational gigs and get back to our original repertoire with stunning versions of our best tracks. An opportunity not to miss!\\". In 2010 a new series of concerts took off with Danny Devos on vocals, Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven on electronics, Mauro Pawlowski on drums and Aldo Struyf on bass. In 2015 Club Moral performed twice in its original setting with Danny Devos on vocals and electronics, and Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven on electronics. On both occasions the performance was on the occasion of an exhibition by Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven, at the Kunstverein M√ºnchen and castillo/corrales in Paris.

The park, named for the 8th U.S. President, Martin Van Buren, was opened to the public in 1950. It is in a small patch of woods in Northwestern Ohio and is surrounded by thousands of acres of fields of corn, wheat and soybeans. Van Buren State Park is open for year-round recreation. History Van Buren State Park is in a region of Ohio that was once populated by members of the Shawnee nation. The Shawnee migrated to the area from south central Ohio. The area in and around the park represented the last stronghold for the Shawnee in Ohio before they were forced to move west of the Mississippi River by the encroachment of Anglo-American pioneers. The process of creating Van Buren State Park began in 1939 when a dam was built over Rocky Ford Creek creating what is now Van Buren Lake. This lake was part of a private wildlife preserve. The lake and preserve were transferred to the state of Ohio in 1950. Ecology Van Buren State Park is in a rich agricultural area. Northwest Ohio is part of the Interior Plains region of North America. The land is largely flat with a few hills that are a remnant of the last ice age. Beneath the topsoil lies a layer of dolomitic limestone. The land was largely forested before it was cleared by farmers. A small patch of woodland, made mostly of beech and sugar maple trees, remains at Van Buren State Park. Typical woodland mammals found in the park include white-tailed deer, red fox, red squirrel, skunk, and opossum. Bird species include the cowbird, woodcock, eastern bluebird, short-eared owl and eastern meadowlark. The park is also home to garter snakes and spring peepers. Wildflowers in the area include chicory, spring beauty, Dutchman's breeches, daisy fleabane and thimbleweed. Recreation =Camping and trails= There are three separate camping areas at Van Buren State Park. The family campground is on the eastern end of the park. It has 29 campsites. Ten campsites have electrical connections, the other 19 do not. There is an equestrian campground with 31 campsites, just three have electrical hookups. These campsites feature tie rails, picket lines and manure bins. A large, primitive, youth group oriented for up to 200 campers is located in the southeastern corner of the park. Van Buren State Park features of hiking trails along the southern shore of Lake Van Buren. The trail is open for hiking, jogging and bird and wildlife observation. There are of trails open to hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders that cross through ravines and woodlands. A three-mile (5 km) trail in the woods on the southern shore of the lake is open to mountain bikes. =Boating, hunting and fishing= Van Buren Lake is open to boating and fishing. Boating is limited to electric powered boats, rowboats and canoes. There is a launch area on the northern end of the lake just off Township Road 229. The lake is home to a variety of fish species including largemouth bass, carp, bluegill, channel catfish, bullhead and crappie. Hunting is limited to bowhunting only. All hunters and anglers are required to have a license issued by the state of Ohio.

He worked most recently as the primary anchor for The History Channel. Previously, Mudd was weekend and weekday substitute anchor for the CBS Evening News, the co-anchor of the weekday NBC Nightly News, and the host of the NBC- TV Meet the Press, and American Almanac TV programs. Mudd is the recipient of the Peabody Award, the Joan Shorenstein Award for Distinguished Washington Reporting, and five Emmy Awards. Early life and career Mudd was born in Washington, D.C. His father, John Kostka Dominic Mudd, was the son of a tobacco farmer, and he worked as a map maker for the United States Geological Survey, and his mother, Irma Iris Harrison, was the daughter of a farmer and she was a lieutenant for the U.S. Army Nursing Corps and then a nurse at the physiotherapy ward in the Walter Reed Hospital, where she met Roger's father. He attended DC Public Schools and graduated from Wilson High School in 1945. Roger Mudd received a B.A. degree from Washington and Lee University in 1950 ‚Äì where one of his classmates was author Tom Wolfe ‚Äì and an M.A. degree from the University of North Carolina in 1953. Mudd is a member of Delta Tau Delta international fraternity. He was initiated as an alumnus member of Omicron Delta Kappa at Washington and Lee in 1966. Mudd began his journalism career in Richmond, Virginia as a reporter for The Richmond News Leader and for radio station WRNL. At the News Leader, he worked at the rewrite desk during spring 1953 and became a summer replacement on June 15 that year. The News Leader ran its first story with a Mudd byline on June 19, 1953. At WRNL radio, Mudd did the daily noon newscast. In his memoir The Place to Be, Mudd describes an incident from his first day at WRNL in which he laughed hysterically on-air after mangling a news item about the declining health of Pope Pius XII. Because Mudd failed to silence his microphone properly, an engineer intervened. WRNL later gave Mudd his own daily broadcast, Virginia Headlines. In the fall of 1954, Mudd enrolled in the University of Richmond School of Law but he dropped out after one semester. WTOP News In the late 1950s, Mudd moved to Washington, D.C., to become a reporter with WTOP News, the news division of the radio and television stations owned by Post-Newsweek. Although WTOP News was a local news department, it covered many national stories. At first Mudd did the 6:00 a.m. newscast for WTOP and he did local news segments on the local TV program Potomac Panorama. During the fall of 1956, Mudd hosted the first newscast he wrote WTOP's 6:00 p.m. newscast that included a weekly commentary piece, all without \\"the constraints of the wire service vocabulary\\". Mudd produced a half-hour TV documentary in summer 1957 advocating the need for a third airport in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. In September that year, Mudd conducted his first live TV studio interview. The interview was with Dorothy Counts, a black teenage girl who suffered racial harassment at her all-white high school in Charlotte, North Carolina. WTOP replaced Don Richards with Mudd for its 11 p.m. newscast in March 1959. CBS News CBS News was located on the third floor of WTOP's studios at 40th and Brandywine in northwest Washington, D.C. Mudd quickly came to the attention of CBS News and moved \\"downstairs\\" to join the Washington bureau on May 31, 1961. For most of his career at CBS, Mudd was a Congressional correspondent. Mudd was also the anchor of the Saturday edition of CBS Evening News and he frequently substituted on the weeknight broadcasts when the anchorman Walter Cronkite was on vacation or working on special assignments. During the Civil Rights Movement, Mudd anchored the August 28, 1963 coverage of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom for CBS. On November 13, 1963, CBS-TV broadcast the documentary Case History of a Rumor, in which Mudd interviewed Rep. James Utt, a Republican of Santa Ana, California, about a rumor that Utt spread about Africans who were supposedly working with the United Nations to take over the United States. Utt sued CBS- TV in U.S. Federal Court for libel, but the court dismissed the case. Mudd also covered numerous political campaigns. He was paired with CBS journalist Robert Trout for the August 1964 Democratic National Convention anchor booth, temporarily displacing Walter Cronkite, in an unsuccessful attempt to match the popular NBC Chet Huntley‚ÄìDavid Brinkley anchor team. Mudd covered the 1968 Presidential campaign of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy and interviewed him at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles only minutes before Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968. Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital. Mudd hosted the seminal documentary The Selling of the Pentagon in 1971. He was a candidate to succeed Walter Cronkite as anchor of the CBS Evening News. Despite substantial support for Mudd within the ranks of CBS News and an offer to co-host with Dan Rather, network management gave the position to Rather after the longtime White House and 60 Minutes correspondent threatened to leave the network for ABC News. =Ted Kennedy interview= Mudd is often remembered for an interview he conducted with Senator Ted Kennedy for a CBS Reports special on November 4, 1979, Teddy, telecast three days before Kennedy announced his challenge to President Jimmy Carter for the 1980 Democratic Presidential nomination. In addition to questioning Kennedy about the Chappaquiddick incident, Mudd asked, \\"Senator, why do you want to be President?\\" Kennedy's stammering answer, which has been described as \\"incoherent and repetitive\\", as well as \\"vague, unprepared\\" raised serious questions about his motivation in seeking the office, and marked the beginning of the sharp decline in Kennedy's poll numbers. Carter defeated Kennedy 50 percent to 38 percent in the Democratic primary vote. Although the Kennedy family refused to permit any further interviews by Mudd, the interview helped strengthen Mudd's reputation as a leading political reporter. Broadcaster and blogger Hugh Hewitt and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson have used the term \\"Roger Mudd moment\\" to describe a self- inflicted disastrous encounter with the press by a presidential candidate. NBC News In 1980, Mudd and Dan Rather were in contention to succeed Walter Cronkite as the weeknight anchor of the CBS Evening News. After CBS awarded the job to Rather, Mudd chose to leave CBS News and he accepted an offer to join NBC News. He co-anchored the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw from April 1982 until September 1983, when Brokaw took over as sole anchor. From 1984 to 1985, Mudd was the co-moderator of the NBC Meet the Press program with Marvin Kalb, and later he served as the co-anchor with Connie Chung on two NBC news magazines, American Almanac and 1986. PBS and The History Channel From 1987 to 1992, Mudd was an essayist and political correspondent with the MacNeil‚ÄìLehrer Newshour on PBS. He was a visiting professor at Princeton University and Washington and Lee University from 1992 to 1996. Mudd was also a primary anchor for over ten years with The History Channel, where many of his programs are still repeated in reruns. Mudd retired from full-time broadcasting in 2004, yet remains involved with documentaries for The History Channel (now known as simply as History). Memoir Mudd's memoir, The Place to Be: Washington, CBS, and the Glory Days of Television News, was published on March 24, 2008. Personal life Mudd resides in McLean, Virginia. He was married to the former E. J. Spears of Richmond, Virginia, who died in 2011. They had three sons and a daughter: Daniel, the former CEO of Fortress Investment Group LLC and the former CEO of Fannie Mae;Government may soon back troubled mortgage giants the singer and songwriter Jonathan Mudd; the author Maria Mudd Ruth and Matthew Mudd. He has 11 grandchildren. Mudd is a collateral descendant of Samuel Mudd, the doctor who was imprisoned for aiding and conspiring with John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

His sole known work is the Prodigiorum liber (Book of Prodigies), a tabulation of the wonders and portents that had occurred in the Roman Republic and early Principate in the years 24912 BC. The material for the Prodigiorum liber was largely excerpted from the 1st century AD Ab Urbe Condita Libri of the Augustan historian Livy, which chronicled the history of the Roman state from its origin to the beginning of the imperial period, though Julius used it selectively and sometimes added interpretations of the omens and incidents he included. There is a common view that Julius only knew Livy's text wholly or in part from an epitome, but there is scant evidence of this. The work was first printed by the Italian humanist, Aldus Manutius, in 1508, after a manuscript belonging to Jodocus of Verona (now lost). Of great importance was the edition by the Basle humanist Conrad Lycosthenes (1552), trying to reconstruct lost parts and illustrating the text with wood-cuts. Later editions were printed by Johannes Schefferus (Amsterdam, 1679), Franciscus Oudendorp (Leiden, 1720) and Otto Jahn (1853, with the periochae of Livy). The text of Julius Obsequens frequently makes reference to unusual astronomical and meteorological events as portentous signs like meteor showers, comets, and sun dogs, alongside earthquakes, aberrant births, haruspicy, and sweating, crying, or bleeding statues. After the alleged Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting in 1947, Harold T. Wilkins among others, interpreted Julius Obsequens as preserving ancient reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Since Julius wrote some four centuries after the latest of the events he describes, his is not an eye-witness account, and for most of his subject matter his source Livy was himself neither an eye-witness nor even a contemporary. In the consulship of Gaius Marius and L. Valerius Flaccus, (100 BC) for example, Julius writes: : At Tarquinii a blazing torch was seen far and wide and fell suddenly dropping. Around the setting of the sun an orb similar to a shield seemed to be borne across [the sky] from the west to the east.Julius Obsequens, Prodigiorum liber, XLV. \\"\\" For the consulship of L. Marcius Philippus and Sextus Julius Caesar, (91 BC) Julius Obsequens reports that: : When Livius Drusus, tribune of the people, was passing his laws, and the Italian War began, many prodigies appeared in the city. Around sunrise a ball of fire flashed out of the sky with a mighty sound from the northern regions. At Arretium as they were breaking bread blood flowed from the middle of the loaves. In the territory of the Vestini for seven days it rained stones and potsherds. At Aenaria a flame which came out of a cleft in the earth flashed out to the sky. Around Regium part of the city and the walls were destroyed by an earth tremor. At Spoletum a ball of fire with a golden hue rolled down to earth. It increased in size and after it was seen being carried from the land to the east it covered the sun with its magnitude.Julius Obsequens, Prodigiorum liber, LIV. \\"\\" Finally, Obsequens provided another example of this phenomenon for the consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and L. Munatius Plancus (42 BC), stating that: :At Rome a mule gave birth by the Twelve Gates. A dead bitch belonging to a temple keeper was dragged away by a dog. Light so shone at night, that it seemed that people woke up for work as though it was daybreak. At Mutina the south facing standard of the Marian victory, of its own accord, turned northward at the fourth hour. When these things were being expiated by sacrificial victims, three suns were seen at around the third hour of the day, then they drew together as one globe.Julius Obsequens, Prodigiorum liber, LXX. \\"\\" References * Julio Obsecuente, Libro de los Prodigios (restituido a su integridad, en beneficio de la Historia, por Conrado Lic√≥stenes), ed.

The song, a jump blues, was written by John Marascalco and producer Robert \\"Bumps\\" Blackwell. Although it was first recorded by Little Richard, Blackwell produced another version by the Valiants, who imitated the fast first version recorded by Little Richard, not released at that time. Although the Valiants' version was released first (in 1957), Little Richard had the hit, reaching #4. Like all his early hits, it quickly became a rock 'n' roll standard and has subsequently been recorded by hundreds of artists. The song is ranked #94 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Song origin Little Richard first heard the phrase \\"Good golly, Miss Molly\\" from a Southern DJ named Jimmy Pennick. He modified the lyrics into the more suggestive \\"Good golly, Miss Molly/You sure like to ball.\\" Little Richard himself later claimed that he took Ike Turner's piano intro from his influential 1951 rock and roll song \\"Rocket 88,\\" and used it for \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly.\\" \\"I always liked that record,\\" Richard recalled, \\"and I used to use the riff in my act, so when we were looking for a lead-in to 'Good Golly, Miss Molly', I did that and it fit.\\" Little Richard Specialty recording sessions =July 30, 1956: J&M; Studio, New Orleans= Supervised by Bumps Blackwell.

Some of the courts are federal in nature, while others are provincial or territorial. The Constitution of Canada gives the federal government the exclusive right to legislate criminal law, while the provinces have exclusive control over much of civil law. The provinces have jurisdiction over the Administration of Justice in their territory. Almost all cases, whether criminal or civil, are heard in provincially or territorially established courts. The quite small system of federal courts only hears cases concerned with matters which are under exclusive federal control, such as federal taxation, federal administrative agencies, intellectual property, some portions of competition law and certain aspects of national security. The federal government appoints and pays for both the judges of the federal courts and the judges of the superior appellate and trial level courts of each province. The provincial governments are responsible for appointing judges of the lower provincial courts. Although not judicial courts themselves, administrative tribunals also feed into the provincial/territorial and federal court hierarchies. This intricate interweaving of federal and provincial powers is typical of the Canadian constitution. Outline of the court system Canadian court system (Source Canadian Department of Justice) Generally speaking, Canada's court system is a four-level hierarchy, as shown below from highest to lowest in terms of legal authority. Each court is bound by the rulings of the courts above them, under the principle of . They are not bound by the rulings of other courts at the same level in the hierarchy. = A note on terminology = There are two terms used in describing the Canadian court structure which can be confusing, and clear definitions are useful at the outset.  Provincial courts  The first is the term \\"provincial court\\", which has two quite different meanings, depending on context. The first, and most general meaning, is that a provincial court is a court established by the Legislature of a province, under its constitutional authority over the Administration of Justice in the Province, set out in s. 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867.Constitution Act, 1867, s. 92(14) This head of power gives the Provinces the power to regulate \\"... the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts\\". All courts created by a Province, from the small claims court or municipal by-law court, up to the provincial Court of Appeal, are \\"provincial courts\\" in this general sense. However, there is a more limited meaning to the term. In most provinces, the \\"Provincial Court\\" is the term used to refer to a specific court created by the Province which is the main criminal court, having jurisdiction over most criminal offences except for the most serious ones. The Provincial Court of a particular province may also have a limited civil jurisdiction, over small claims and some family law matters. The exact scope of the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court will depend on the laws enacted by the particular province. Provincial Courts in this sense are courts of limited statutory jurisdiction, sometimes referred to as \\"inferior courts\\". As courts of limited jurisdiction, their decisions are potentially subject to judicial review by the superior courts via the prerogative writs, but in most cases there are now well-established statutory rights of appeal instead. To distinguish between the two meanings of the term, capitalization is used. A reference to a \\"provincial court\\" normally is a reference to the broad meaning of the term, any court created by the Province. A reference to \\"Provincial Court\\" normally is referring to the specific court of limited statutory jurisdiction, created by the Province.  Superior courts  The second is the term \\"superior courts\\". This term also has two different meanings, one general and one specific. The general meaning is that a superior court is a court of inherent jurisdiction. Historically, they are the descendants of the royal superior courts in England. The decisions of a superior court are not subject to review unless a statute specifically provides for review or appeal. The term is not limited to trial courts. The provincial courts of appeal and the Federal Court of Appeal are also superior courts. The more limited sense is that \\"Superior Court\\" can be used to refer to the superior trial court of original jurisdiction in the Province. This terminology is used in the court systems of Ontario and Quebec. The difference between the two terms is also indicated by capitalization. The term \\"superior court\\" is used to mean the general sense of the term, while \\"Superior Court\\" is used to refer to specific courts in provinces which use that term to designate their superior trial courts. In Ontario and Quebec, this court is known as Superior Court (); in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, as Court of Queen's Bench (); and in Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories as the Supreme Court (). The term \\"Supreme Court\\" can be confusing as it could suggest a final appellate court, like the Supreme Court of Canada; in fact, each province has a Court of Appeal superior to its superior court, except in Newfoundland and Labrador where appeals lie to the Appeals Division of the Supreme Court. In Nunavut, there is a single unified trial court, the Nunavut Court of Justice, unlike the situation in the provinces and other territories. =Supreme Court of Canada= bench for justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, the final court of appeals in the country The Supreme Court is established by the Supreme Court ActSupreme Court Act, RSC 1985, c S-26 as the \\"General Court of Appeal for Canada\\". The Court currently consists of nine justices, which include the Chief Justice of Canada and eight puisne justices. The court's duties include hearing appeals of decisions from the appellate courts (to be discussed next) and, on occasion, delivering references (i.e., the court's opinion) on constitutional questions raised by the federal government. By law, three of the nine justices are appointed from Quebec because of Quebec's use of civil law. The Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal Parliament the power to create a \\"General Court of Appeal for Canada\\".Constitution Act, 1867, s 101 Following Confederation, the Conservative government of Sir John A. Macdonald proposed the creation of a Supreme Court and introduced two bills in successive sessions of Parliament to trigger public debate on the proposed court and its powers.Snell and Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada - History of the Institution (Toronto: Osgoode Society, 1985), pp. 6-7.l Eventually, in 1875, the Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie passed an Act of Parliament that established the Supreme Court.The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, S.C. 1875, c. 11. The 1875 Act built upon the proposals introduced by the Macdonald government, and passed with all-party support.Snell and Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada - History of the Institution, pp. 10-11 Initially, decisions of the Supreme Court could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council. As well, litigants could appeal directly from the provincial courts of appeal directly to the Judicial Committee, by-passing the Supreme Court entirely. There was a provision in the 1875 Act which attempted to limit appeals to the Judicial Committee. That clause resulted in the Governor General reserving the bill for consideration by the Queen-in- Council.Snell and Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada - History of the Institution, p. 16. After much debate between Canadian and British officials, royal assent was granted on the understanding the clause did not in fact affect the royal prerogative to hear appeals, exercised through the Judicial Committee.Snell and Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada - History of the Institution, pp. 178-179. The question of the power of Parliament to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee eventually was tested in the courts. In 1926, the Judicial Committee ruled that the Canadian Parliament lacked the jurisdiction to extinguish appeals to the Judicial Committee, as the right of appeal was founded in the royal prerogative and could only be terminated by the Imperial Parliament.Nadan v The King, [1926] AC 482 (PC) Following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in 1933 the federal Parliament passed legislation again abolishing the right of appeal in criminal matters. In 1935, the Judicial Committee upheld the constitutional validity of that amendment.British Coal Corp v The King, [1935] AC 500 (PC). In 1939, the federal government proposed a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking whether the federal Parliament could terminate all appeals to the Judicial Committee. By a 4‚Äì2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the proposal was within the powers of the federal Parliament and would be constitutional.Reference re Supreme Court Act Amendment Act, [1940] SCR 49. The question was then appealed to the Judicial Committee, but the hearing of the appeal was delayed by the outbreak of World War II.Snell and Vaughan, The Supreme Court of Canada - History of the Institution, p. 188. In 1946, the Judicial Committee finally heard the appeal and upheld the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court,Reference re Privy Council Appeals, [1947] AC 127. clearing the way for Parliament to enact legislation to end all appeals to the Judicial Committee, whether from the Supreme Court or from the provincial courts of appeal. In 1949, Parliament passed an amendment to the Supreme Court Act which abolished all appeals, making the Court truly the Supreme Court.An Act to Amend the Supreme Court Act, SC 1949, c 37. However, cases which had been instituted in the lower courts prior to the amendment could still be appealed to the Judicial Committee. The last Canadian appeal to the Judicial Committee was not decided until 1960.Ponoka-Calmar Oils v Wakefield, [1960] AC 18 (PC). =Courts of the provinces and territories=  Provincial and territorial appellate courts  These courts of appeal exist at the provincial and territorial levels and were separately constituted in the early decades of the 20th century, replacing the former Full Courts of the old Supreme Courts of the provinces, some of which were then renamed Courts of Queen's Bench. Their function is to hear appeals from decisions rendered by the trial courts and to deliver references when requested by a provincial or territorial government as the Supreme Court does for the federal government.

Each province's chief justice sits in the appellate court of that province. Provincial and territorial superior trial courts  The superior trial courts of the provinces and territories are the courts of first instance for divorce petitions, civil lawsuits involving claims greater than small claims, and criminal prosecutions for some indictable offences. They also hear appeals from the lower trial court and perform judicial review of decisions of administrative agencies such as labour relations boards, human rights tribunals and licensing authorities. As the primary courts responsible for the interpretation of civil (provincial) law, they play a significant role in the establishment and interpretation of legal precedent. The judges sitting on these courts, like those of the appellate courts, are appointed and paid by the federal government. *Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta (ABQB) *Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC) *Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba (MBQB) *Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick (NBQB) *Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (NLSC) *Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories (NTSC)Northwest Territories Act, S.C. 2014, c. 2, s. 2; Judicature Act, R.S.N.W.T. 1988, c.

Although some of these courts are named the \\"Supreme Court\\", they are not the highest courts in their respective province or territory. Most provinces have special courts dealing with small claims (typically actions involving under $50,000). These are typically divisions of the superior courts in each province, however certain provinces also delegate this to lower courts. Parties often represent themselves, without lawyers, in these courts. Provincial and territorial courts of limited jurisdiction Each province and territory in Canada (other than Nunavut) also has an additional trial court, usually called a Provincial (or Territorial) Court, to hear certain types of cases. For historical reasons, these courts are sometimes referred to as \\"inferior courts\\", indicating their position in the judicial hierarchy as subject to the superior courts. The term is not a commentary on their professionalism or expertise. *Provincial Court of Alberta (ABPC) *Provincial Court of British Columbia (BCPC) *Provincial Court of Manitoba (MBPC) *Provincial Court of New Brunswick (NBPC) *Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (NLPC) *Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories (NTTC) *Provincial Court of Nova Scotia (NSPC) *Nunavut Court of Justice (NUCJ) *Court of Ontario ‚Äì Ontario Court of Justice (ONCJ) *Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island (PEPC) *Court of Quebec (QCCQ) *Provincial Court of Saskatchewan (SKPC) *Territorial Court of Yukon (YKTC) Appeals from these courts are heard either by the superior trial court of the province or territory or by the provincial or territorial court of appeal. In criminal cases, this depends on the seriousness of the offence. Preliminary hearings are normally held in provincial courts prior to the case being transferred to superior court for trial. These courts are created by provincial statute and only have the jurisdiction granted by statute. Accordingly, inferior courts do not have inherent jurisdiction. These courts are usually the successors of older local courts presided over by lay magistrates and justices of the peace who did not necessarily have formal legal training. However, today all judges are legally trained, although justices of the peace may not be. Many inferior courts have specialized functions, such as hearing only criminal law matters, youth matters, family law matters, small claims matters, \\"quasi-criminal\\" offences (i.e., violations of provincial statutes), or bylaw infractions. In some jurisdictions these courts serve as an appeal division from the decisions of administrative tribunals. =Federal courts= In addition to the Supreme Court of Canada, there are three civil courts created by the federal Parliament under its legislative authority under section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867: the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, and the Tax Court of Canada.  Federal Court of Appeal  The Federal Court of Appeal hears appeals from decisions rendered by the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and a certain group of federal administrative tribunals like the National Energy Board and the Canada Industrial Relations Board. All judges of the Federal Court are judges of the Federal Court of Appeal, and vice versa, although it is rare that a judge of one court will sit as a member of the other. The Federal Court of Appeal is a travelling court. The judges of the Court sit in panels of three, and hear cases in English and in French in 18 cities, from Vancouver to St. John's, including locations in northern Canada.  Federal Court  The Federal Court exists primarily to review administrative decisions by federal government bodies such as the immigration board and to hear lawsuits under the federal government's jurisdiction such as intellectual property and maritime law. It also has concurrent jurisdiction with the superior trial courts of the provinces to hear civil lawsuits brought against the federal government. The Federal Court also has jurisdiction to determine inter-jurisdictional legal actions between the federal government and a province, or between different provinces, provided the province in question has passed corresponding legislation granting the Federal Court jurisdiction over the dispute. The Federal Court have the power to review decisions, orders, and other administrative actions of most federal boards, commissions, and tribunals. That means most federal government administrative decisions can be challenged in the Federal Court. Also with the Federal Court, the system may refer back to questions of law, jurisdiction, or price to one of the federal courts at any stage of proceeding. In the aftermath of 9/11, Parliament enacted a number of laws to protect national security. The Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine many issues which arise under those laws relating to national security. Appeals lie from the Federal Court to the Federal Court of Appeal.  Tax Court of Canada  The Tax Court of Canada has a very specialized jurisdiction. It hears disputes over federal taxes, primarily under the federal Income Tax Act, between taxpayers and the federal government. Also, for most people that live in Canada, it is the Tax Court's power to hear appeals under the Income Tax Act. The Tax Court has the jurisdiction to hear appeals under various statutes. However, as a federal court, it lacks the power to deal with disputes relating to provincial income taxes and provincial sales taxes, and has no jurisdiction to grant any relief where a taxpayer wishes to sue the Canada Revenue Agency for damages. Lastly, the Tax Court's powers are also limited by the statutes that impose the tax in dispute. The Tax Court is not empowered to make decisions on the basis that they will yield a fair result. Rather, the Tax Court can only make decisions based on its interpretation of the legislation.  History of the federal courts  The first federal court was the Exchequer Court of Canada, created in 1875 at the same time as the Supreme Court of Canada. The Exchequer Court was a trial court, with a limited jurisdiction over civil actions brought against the federal government, tax disputes under federal tax laws, admiralty matters, compensation for expropriation of private property by the federal Crown, negligence of federal public servants, and intellectual property, including patents and copyright. The name of the court came from the Exchequer Court of England, which had a similar jurisdiction over tax disputes. At first, there were no separate judges for the Exchequer Court. The judges of the Supreme Court of Canada were also appointed to the Exchequer Court. Individual judges of the Supreme Court would sit as a judge of the Exchequer Court, with an appeal lying to the Supreme Court. The Exchequer Court did not have any jurisdiction to review the actions of federal administrative agencies. That function was fulfilled by the provincial superior trial courts. In 1971, Parliament passed the Federal Court ActFederal Court Act, RSC 1970 (2nd Supp), c 10 which abolished the Exchequer Court and created a new court, the Federal Court of Canada. That Court had two divisions: the Federal Court ‚Äì Trial Division, and the Federal Court ‚Äì Appeal Division. Although the two divisions had different functions, they were all part of a single court. In 2003, Parliament passed legislation which divided the Federal Court into two courts. The Federal Court ‚Äì Trial Division became the Federal Court of Canada, while the Federal Court ‚Äì Appeal Division became the Federal Court of Appeal. The jurisdiction of the two new courts is essentially the same as the corresponding former divisions of the Federal Court. Although the federal courts can be said to have the same prestige as the superior courts from the provinces and territories, they lack the \\"inherent jurisdiction\\" (to be explained later) possessed by superior courts such as the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. =Military courts= Military courts in Canada include the summary trial hearing, court martial (including general court martial and standing court martial), and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. Summary trials are hearings used to dispense with minor service offences. The Presiding Officer will have little formal legal training and is generally the service member's Commanding Officer. In this respect, these hearings are similar to the former lay magistrates' courts. The courts martial are conducted and presided over by military personnel and exist for the prosecution of military personnel, as well as civilian personnel who accompany military personnel, accused of violating the Code of Service Discipline, which is found in the National Defence ActR.S.C. 1985, c. N-5. and constitutes a complete code of military law applicable to persons under military jurisdiction. The decisions of the courts martial can be appealed to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada which, in contrast, exists outside the military and is made up of civilian judges. This appellate court is the successor of the Court Martial Appeal Board which was created in 1950, presided over by civilian judges and lawyers, and was the first ever civilian-based adjudicating body with authority to review decisions by a military court. The Court Martial Appeal Court is made up of civilian judges from the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and the superior courts of the provinces. =Administrative tribunals= Known in Canada as simply \\"tribunals\\", these are quasi-judicial adjudicative bodies, which means that they adjudicate (hear evidence and render decisions) like courts, but are not necessarily presided over by judges. Instead, the adjudicators may be experts of the very specific legal field handled by the tribunal (e.g., labour law, human rights law, immigration law, energy law, workers' compensation law, liquor licensing law, etc.) who hear arguments and evidence provided by lawyers (also lay advocates in British Columbia or Licensed Paralegals in Ontario) before making a written decision on record. Depending on its enabling legislation, a tribunal's decisions may be reviewed by a court through an appeal or a process called judicial review. The reviewing court may be required to show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized expertise or knowledge that the court does not have. The degree of deference will also depend on such factors as the specific wording of the legislation creating the tribunal. Tribunals whose enabling legislation contains a privative clause are entitled to a high degree of deference, although a recent decision of the Supreme Court of CanadaDunsmuir v New Brunswick, [2008 1 SCR 190], 2008 SCC 9. has arguably lowered that degree of deference. Tribunals which have the power to decide questions of law may take into consideration the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is part of Canada's constitution. The extent to which tribunals may use the Charter in their decisions is a source of ongoing legal debate. Appearing before some administrative tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal than that of a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, so that some evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While relevant evidence is admissible, evidence which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight. The presiding adjudicator is normally called \\"Mister/Madam Chair\\". As is the case in court, lawyers routinely appear in tribunals advocating matters for their clients. A person does not require a lawyer to appear before an administrative tribunal. Indeed, many of these tribunals are specifically designed to be more representative to unrepresented litigants than courts. Furthermore, some of these tribunals are part of a comprehensive dispute-resolution system, which may emphasize mediation rather than litigation. For example, provincial human rights commissions routinely use mediation to resolve many human rights complaints without the need for a hearing. What tribunals all have in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually appointed by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights. Most importantly, from a lawyer's perspective, is the fact that the principle of does not apply to tribunals. In other words, a tribunal adjudicator could legally make a decision that differs from a past decision, on the same subject and issues, delivered by the highest court in the land. Because a tribunal is not bound by legal precedent, established by itself or by a reviewing court, a tribunal is not a court even though it performs an important adjudicative function and contributes to the development of law like a court would do. Although ' does not apply to tribunals, their adjudicators will likely nonetheless find a prior court decision on a similar subject to be highly persuasive and will likely follow the courts in order to ensure consistency in the law and to prevent the embarrassment of having their decisions overturned by the courts. The same is true for past decisions of the tribunal. Among the federal tribunals, there is a small group of tribunals whose decisions must be appealed directly to the Federal Court of Appeal rather than to the Federal Court Trial Division. These so-called \\"super tribunals\\" are listed in subsection 28(1) of the Federal Courts ActR.S.C., 1985, c. F-7. and some examples include the National Energy Board, Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (i.e., federal labour board), the Copyright Board and the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Inherent versus statutory jurisdiction = Courts of inherent jurisdiction = The superior courts from the provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, which means that the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief. =Statutory courts= The Supreme Court of Canada, the federal courts, the various appellate courts from the provinces and territories, and the numerous low-level provincial courts are statutory courts whose decision-making power is granted by either the federal parliament or a provincial legislature. The word \\"statutory\\" refers to the fact that these courts' powers are derived from a statute and is defined and limited by the terms of the statute. A statutory court cannot try cases in areas of law that are not mentioned or suggested in the statute. In this sense, statutory courts are similar to non-judicial adjudicative bodies such as administrative tribunals, boards, and commissions, which are created and given limited power by legislation. The practical implication of this is that a statutory court cannot provide a type of legal remedy or relief that is not expressly or implicitly referred to in its enabling or empowering statute. Appointment and regulation of judges Judges in Canada are appointed and not elected. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, the federal courts, the appellate courts and the superior-level courts are appointed by the Governor-in-Council (by the Governor General on the advice of the Federal Cabinet).Constitution Act, 1867, s. 96 For example, judges of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice are chosen not by Ontario's provincial government but upon the recommendations of Her Majesty's Canadian Government. Meanwhile, judicial appointments to judicial posts in the so-called \\"inferior\\" or \\"provincial\\" courts are made by the local provincial governments. As judicial independence is seen by Canadian law to be essential to a functioning democracy, the regulating of Canadian judges requires the involvement of the judges themselves. The Canadian Judicial Council, made up of the chief justices and associate chief justices of the federal courts and of each province and territory, receive complaints from the public concerning questionable behaviour from members of the bench. Salaries of superior courts are set by Parliament under section 100 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Since the Provincial Judges Reference,[1997] 3 SCR 3. provincial courts' salaries are recommended by independent commissions, and a similar body called the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission was established in 1999 for federally appointed judges. =Tenure of judges and removal from the bench= Judges in positions that are under federal control (federally appointed positions) are eligible to serve on the bench until age 75. In some but not all Provincial and Territorial positions, appointed judges have tenure until age 70 instead. As for removal from the bench, judges have only rarely been removed from the bench in Canada. For federally appointed judges, it is the task of The Canadian Judicial Council to investigate complaints and allegations of misconduct on the part of federally appointed judges. The Council may recommend to the (federal) Minister of Justice that the judge be removed. To do so, the Minister must in turn get the approval of both the House of Commons and the Senate before a judge can be removed from office. (The rules for provincial/territorial judges are similar, but they can be removed by a provincial or territorial cabinet.) Languages used in court Signage for the supreme court in French and English. Either language may be used in federal courts. English and French are both official languages of the federal government of Canada. Either official language may be used by any person or in any pleading or process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established by Parliament under the Constitution Act, 1867.Constitution Act, 1867, s. 133.Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 19(1). This constitutional guarantee applies to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and the Court Martial Appeal Court. Parliament has expanded on that constitutional guarantee to ensure the federal courts are institutionally bilingual.Official Languages Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.), Part III, Administration of Justice. The right to use either language in the provincial and territorial courts varies. The Constitution guarantees the right to use either French or English in the courts of Quebec,Constitution Act, 1867, s. 133 Manitoba,Manitoba Act, 1870, s. 23. and New Brunswick.Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 19(2). There is a statutory right to use either English or French in the courts of OntarioCourts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, ss. 125 and 126. and Saskatchewan,Language Act / Loi linguistique, S.S. 1988, c. L-6.1, s. 11 and a limited right to use French in oral submissions in the courts of Alberta.Language Act, R.S.A. 2000 cL-6, s. 4 As well, in all criminal trials under the Criminal Code, a federal statute, every accused whose language is either English or French has the right to be tried in the language of their choice.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, Part XVII . As a result, every court of criminal jurisdiction in Canada, whether federal, provincial or territorial, must have the institutional capacity to provide trials in either language. Furthermore, under section 14 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter. In the Northwest TerritoriesOfficial Languages Act, R.S.N.W.T. 1988, c. O-1, s. 9(2) and NunavutOfficial Languages Act = , S.Nu. 2008, c. 10 , s. 8 the official aboriginal languages may be used as well. Court customs A Canadian courtroom with the arms of Canada, and a photo of the Canadian monarch Courtroom custom is largely based upon the British tradition, with a few modifications. =Symbols= Canadian courts derive their authority from the monarch. Consequently, the judicial system in Canada is formally known as \\"the Queen on the Bench\\". As a result, important symbols in a courtroom include the picture of the Canadian monarch and their heraldic Arms, although not all courtrooms have a picture of the monarch. Many courts display Canadian and provincial flags. In the British Columbia courts as well as in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom is displayed for reasons of tradition. =Dress= In superior courts, lawyers wear black robes and white neck tabs, like barristers in the United Kingdom, but they do not wear wigs. Business attire is appropriate when appearing before judges of superior courts sitting in chambers and before judges of provincial or territorial courts or justices of the peace. R. B. Bennett in his barristers gown, c. 1932. Lawyers appearing before the Federal Court or the Tax Court of Canada are required to wear a gown. Judges dress in barrister's robes similar to the lawyers'. Judges of some courts adorn their robes with coloured sashes. For example, Federal Court Judges' robes are adorned with a gold sash, and Tax Court of Canada Judges' robes with a purple sash. =Etiquette/Decorum= * Judges do not use gavels. Instead, a judge raises their voice (or stands up if necessary) to restore order in the courtroom. * In most jurisdictions, when entering or leaving a courtroom when there is a judge seated inside, one should bow, while standing inside the court but near the doorway, in the direction of the seated judge. Many lawyers also bow when crossing the bar. * Judges of superior courts in some provinces are traditionally addressed as \\"My Lord\\" or \\"My Lady,\\" but in other provinces are referred to as \\"Your Honour\\". Judges of inferior courts are always traditionally referred to in person as \\"Your Honour\\". The practice varies across jurisdictions, with some superior court judges preferring the titles \\"Mister Justice\\" or \\"Madam Justice\\" to \\"Lordship\\".Styles of address Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and of the federal-level courts prefer the use of \\"Mister/Madam (Chief) Justice\\". Justices of the Peace are addressed as \\"Your Worship\\". The French-language style used in Quebec is in all levels of court, although some lawyers unofficially say or (your lordship). * Judges of inferior courts are referred to as \\"Judge [Surname]\\" while judges of superior and federal courts are referred to as \\"Mister/Madam Justice [Surname],\\" except in Ontario, where all trial judges in referred to as \\"Mister/Madam Justice\\". * A lawyer advocating in court typically uses \\"I\\" when referring to him or herself. The word \\"we\\" is not used, even if the lawyer is referring to him/herself and his/her client as a group. * The judge in court refers to a lawyer as \\"counsel\\" (not \\"counsellor\\"), or simply \\"Mr./Ms. [surname]\\". In Quebec, the title \\"\\" is used. * In court, it is customary for opposing counsel to refer to one another as \\"my friend\\", or sometimes (usually in the case of Queen's Counsel) \\"my learned friend\\". * In any criminal law case, the prosecuting party is \\"the Crown\\" while the criminally prosecuted person is called the \\"accused\\" (not the \\"defendant\\"). The prosecuting lawyer is called \\"Crown Counsel\\" (or, in Ontario, \\"Crown attorney\\"). Crown counsel in criminal proceedings are customarily addressed and referred to as \\"Mr. Crown\\" or \\"Madam Crown.\\" * The \\"versus\\" or \\"v.\\" in the style of cause of Canadian court cases is often pronounced \\"and\\" (rather than \\"vee\\" or \\"versus\\" as in the U.S. or \\"against\\" in criminal proceedings in England, Scotland, and Australasia). For example, Roncarelli v Duplessis would be pronounced \\"Roncarelli and Duplessis\\". =Procedure= Justices of the Supreme Court of Ontario, with the court clerk seated below the bench. Documents and other forms are evidence is passed to the clerk before being handed to the judge. * The judicial function of the Royal Prerogative is performed in trust and in the Queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's court, who enjoy the privilege granted conditionally by the sovereign to be free from criminal and civil liability for unsworn statements made within the court. This dispensation extends from the notion in common law that the sovereign \\"can do no wrong\\". * There are no so-called \\"sidebars\\" where lawyers from both sides approach the bench in order to have a quiet and discreet conversation with the judge while court is in session. * Trial judges typically take a passive role during trial; however, during their charge to the jury, judges may comment upon the value of certain testimony or suggest the appropriate amount of damages in a civil case, although they are required to tell the jury that it is to make its own decision and is not bound to agree with the judge. * Jury trials are less frequent than in the United States and usually reserved for serious criminal cases. A person accused of a crime punishable by imprisonment for five years or more has the constitutional right to a jury trial. Only British Columbia and Ontario regularly use juries in civil trials. * Evidence and documents are not passed directly to the judge, but instead passed to the judge through the court clerk. The clerk, referred to as \\"Mister/Madam Clerk\\" or \\"Mister/Madam Registrar\\", also wears a robe and sits in front of the judge and faces the lawyers. * In some jurisdictions, the client sits with the general public, behind counsel's table, rather than beside his or her lawyer at counsel's table. The accused in a criminal trial sits in the prisoners box often located on the side wall opposite the jury, or in the middle of the courtroom. However it is becoming increasingly common for accused persons to sit at counsel table with their lawyers or in the body of the courtroom, particularly when the accused is not in custody. * In four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario), the superior-level courts employ judicial officers known as Masters who deal only with interlocutory motions (or interlocutory applications) in civil cases. With such Masters dealing with the relatively short interlocutory motion/application hearings, trial judges can devote more time on more lengthy hearings such as trials. In the Federal Court, a Prothonotary holds a similar positions to that of a Master.

KP is considerably weaker than Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZFC), and can be thought of as roughly the predicative part of ZFC. The consistency strength of KP with an axiom of infinity is given by the Bachmann‚ÄìHoward ordinal. Unlike ZFC, KP does not include the power set axiom, and KP includes only limited forms of the axiom of separation and axiom of replacement from ZFC. These restrictions on the axioms of KP lead to close connections between KP, generalized recursion theory, and the theory of admissible ordinals.  The axioms of KP  * Axiom of extensionality: Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements. * Axiom of induction: œÜ(a) being a formula, if for all sets x the assumption that œÜ(y) holds for all elements y of x entails that œÜ(x) holds, then œÜ(x) holds for all sets x. * Axiom of empty set: There exists a set with no members, called the empty set and denoted {}. (Note: the existence of a member in the universe of discourse, i.e., ‚àÉx(x=x), is implied in certain formulations, note at end of ¬ß2.3 on page 27: \\"Those who do not allow relations on an empty universe consider (‚àÉx)x=x and its consequences as theses; we, however, do not share this abhorrence, with so little logical ground, of a vacuum.\\" of first-order logic, in which case the axiom of empty set follows from the axiom of Œ£0-separation, and is thus redundant.) * Axiom of pairing: If x, y are sets, then so is {x, y}, a set containing x and y as its only elements. * Axiom of union: For any set x, there is a set y such that the elements of y are precisely the elements of the elements of x. * Axiom of Œ£0-separation: Given any set and any Œ£0-formula œÜ(x), there is a subset of the original set containing precisely those elements x for which œÜ(x) holds. (This is an axiom schema.) * Axiom of Œ£0-collection: Given any Œ£0-formula œÜ(x, y), if for every set x there exists a unique set y such that œÜ(x, y) holds, then for all sets u there exists a set v such that for every x in u there is a y in v such that œÜ(x, y) holds. Here, a Œ£0, or Œ†0, or Œî0 formula is one all of whose quantifiers are bounded. This means any quantification is the form \\\\forall u \\\\in v or \\\\exist u \\\\in v. (More generally, we would say that a formula is Œ£n+1 when it is obtained by adding existential quantifiers in front of a Œ†n formula, and that it is Œ†n+1 when it is obtained by adding universal quantifiers in front of a Œ£n formula: this is related to the arithmetical hierarchy but in the context of set theory.) *Some but not all authors include an axiom of infinity (in which case the empty set axiom is unnecessary as it can be proven to exist using Separation). These axioms are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the axioms of powerset, choice, and sometimes infinity. Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas œÜ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only. The axiom of induction in the context of KP is stronger than the usual axiom of regularity, which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set). Not adopting Regularity or the Axiom of Choice, KP can be studied as a constructive set theory by dropping the law of excluded middle, without changing any axioms.  Proof that Cartesian products exist  Theorem: If A and B are sets, then there is a set A√óB which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) of elements a of A and b of B. Proof: The set {a} (which is the same as {a, a} by the axiom of extensionality) and the set {a, b} both exist by the axiom of pairing. Thus :(a,b) := \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} exists by the axiom of pairing as well. A possible Œî0 formula expressing that p stands for (a, b) is: :\\\\exist r \\\\in p\\\\, (a \\\\in r\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in r\\\\, (x = a))\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\exist s \\\\in p\\\\, (a \\\\in s \\\\,\\\\land\\\\, b \\\\in s\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in s\\\\, (x = a \\\\,\\\\lor\\\\, x = b))\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, ::\\\\forall t \\\\in p\\\\, ((a \\\\in t\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in t\\\\, (x = a))\\\\, \\\\lor\\\\, (a \\\\in t \\\\land b \\\\in t \\\\land \\\\forall x \\\\in t\\\\, (x = a \\\\,\\\\lor\\\\, x = b))). Thus a superset of A√ó{b} = {(a, b)  a in A} exists by the axiom of collection. Denote the formula for p above by \\\\psi (a, b, p). Then the following formula is also Œî0 :\\\\exist a \\\\in A \\\\,\\\\psi (a, b, p) \\\\,. Thus A√ó{b} itself exists by the axiom of separation. If v is intended to stand for A√ó{b}, then a Œî0 formula expressing that is: :\\\\forall a \\\\in A\\\\, \\\\exist p \\\\in v\\\\, \\\\psi (a, b, p)\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\forall p \\\\in v\\\\, \\\\exist a \\\\in A\\\\, \\\\psi (a, b, p) \\\\,. Thus a superset of {A√ó{b}  b in B} exists by the axiom of collection. Putting \\\\exist b \\\\in B in front of that last formula and we get from the axiom of separation that the set {A√ó{b}  b in B} itself exists. Finally, A√óB = \\\\cup{A√ó{b}  b in B} exists by the axiom of union. QED  Admissible sets  A set A\\\\, is called admissible if it is transitive and \\\\langle A,\\\\in \\\\rangle is a model of Kripke‚ÄìPlatek set theory. An ordinal number Œ± is called an admissible ordinal if LŒ± is an admissible set. The ordinal Œ± is an admissible ordinal if and only if Œ± is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a Œ≥ < Œ± for which there is a Œ£1(LŒ±) mapping from Œ≥ onto Œ±. If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal. If LŒ± is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Œ£0-collection, then it is said to be an \\"amenable set\\".

The number was simply described as hundred and translated into Latin in Germanic- speaking countries as (Roman numeral C), but the qualifier \\"long\\" is now added because present English uses the word \\"hundred\\" exclusively to refer to the number of five score (100) instead. The long hundred was 120 but the long thousand was reckoned decimally as 10 long hundreds (1200). Etymology The word is cognate with hunderd in Old Frisian, hundra√∞ in Old Norse, and hundert in Old German. English unit The hundred () was an English unit of measurement used in the production, sale, and taxation of various items in the medieval kingdom of England. The value was often not equal to 100 units, mostly owing to the continued medieval use of the Germanic long hundred of 120. The unit's use as a measure of weight is now described as a hundredweight. The Latin edition of the Assize of Weights and Measures, one of the statutes of uncertain date from around the year 1300, describes hundreds of (red) herring (a long hundred of 120 fish), beeswax, sugar, pepper, cumin, and alum (\\" stone, each stone containing 8 pounds\\" or 108 Tower lbs.), coarse and woven linen, hemp canvas (a long hundred of 120 ells), and iron or horseshoes and shillings (a short hundred of 100 pieces).. & & Later versions used the Troy or avoirdupois pounds in their reckonings instead and included hundreds of fresh herrings (a short hundred of 100 fish), cinnamon, nutmegs ( stone of 8 lb), and garlic (\\"15 ropes of 15 heads\\" or 225 heads). History The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of glosses such as \\"tenty-wise\\" or \\"ten-count\\" denoting that certain numbers are to be understood as decimal. Such glosses would not be expected where decimal counting was usual. In the Gothic Bible,I Cor. 15:6 some marginalia glosses a five hundred (fimf hundram) in the text as being understood taihuntewjam (\\"tenty-wise\\"). Similar words are known in most other Germanic languages. Old Norse clearly used such a system, with its words for \\"one hundred and eighty\\" meaning 200 and \\"two hundred\\" meaning 240. Its use in medieval England and Scotland is documented by Stevenson and Goodare, although Goodare notes that it was sometimes avoided by using numbers such as \\"seven score\\". The Assize of Weights and Measures, one of England's statutes of uncertain date from , shows both the short and long hundred in competing use: the hundred of kippers is formed by six score fish and the hundred of hemp canvas and linen cloth is formed by six score ells but the hundred of pounds to be used in measuring bulk goods is five times twenty and the hundred of fresh herring is five score fish. Within the original Latin text, the numeral c. is used for a value of 120: (\\"And each such 'hundred' contains six twenties.\\"). & & The reckoning by long hundreds waned as Arabic numerals (which require strict base 10) spread throughout Europe during and after the 14th century.

The population of this civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 2,271. Near Credenhill is the site of the former Royal Air Force station RAF Credenhill which was redeveloped by the British Army for new headquarters for the 22 Special Air Service Regiment who moved in 1999 and in 2000 the base was designated as Stirling Lines. History Credenhill village has had military connections since 80 BC, when Iron Age Celts constructed a hill fort and earthwork defence system commanding the surrounding area. The Romans founded the town of Magnis at what is now Kenchester, which was later abandoned during the withdrawal of Roman armies from Britain. In 428 AD Magnis was destroyed by a fire during raids by the Picts and Scots. The remains of the old fort was occupied by the Saxons in 480 AD. The Saxon chief Creoda occupied the fort in 540 AD, and \\"Creoda's Hill\\" gave its name to Credenhill. During the First World War, land in Credenhill was occupied by an army unit to store ammunition. In 1939 the land was requisitioned for defence and became RAF Hereford. The 12th-century church of St Mary is a grade I listed building. Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Breinton with a total ward population as at the 2011 Census of 3,612.  Surrounding area  There is an Iron Age hill fort half a mile north of Credenhill. Archaeological finds are in Hereford Museum. The defences of this very large hill fort follow the 600 ft contour and enclose nearly 50 acres (200,000 m¬≤). They comprise an embankment and ditch with a slight counter- scarp bank. There are traces of a quarry ditch inside the main rampart around most of the circuit. Original in-turned entrances are at the centre of the east side and at the south-east corner, each approached by a hollow way cut deeply into the hillside.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 153. Geography Cotterstock is on the banks of the River Nene, which flows through the city of Peterborough to the north east and empties into the North Sea in The Wash. The nearest larger town is Oundle to the south west. History Cotterstock was recorded in the Domesday Book as Codestoche, the name probably deriving from Old English \\"corther-stoc\\" (dairy farm). In the summer of 1736 a Romano- British villa was discovered when tesserae from a large mosaic pavement were uncovered during ploughing. The villa was subsequently located a second time by aerial photography during the extremely dry summer of 1976, when parch marks of buried walls were recorded spread across three fields. A geophysical survey undertaken to accurately locate and amplify the aerial photographic information was carried out over a total of ten days in 1992 and 1993. A total of 19,140 soil resistance values were recorded at one-metre intervals within a grid composed of 20-metre squares.The villa was published by Stephen G. Upex, \\"The Roman Villa at Cotterstock, Northamptonshire\\" Britannia 32 (2001):57-91). The Church of St Andrew is located to the east of the village, adjacent to the River Nene; it dates from the late 12th century. The main period of construction was in the 13th and 14th centuries and the building was restored and extended in 1876. Cotterstock Hall was built in 1658 with alterations in the early 18th century and a main staircase added in the 19th century. The poet and playwright John Dryden was a frequent visitor and is thought to have stayed in the south-west attic room at the Hall, visiting relatives, the last of whom, Rev Sir George Booth, died in 1797. The house was later purchased by Jane Fane, Countess of Westmorland, who died there in 1857. Also of interest is the Old Mill which was built during the early 19th century. Cotterstock parish contains 20 entries on the statutory list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest, 16 of which are within the Conservation Area covering the eastern part of the village around St Andrew's Church and Cotterstock Hall. Tree Preservation Orders have been made on trees in and around the village. Cotterstock was the birthplace of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada from 1791‚Äì1796 and founder of Toronto, who was born here on 25 February 1752.  Infrastructure  The village consists of a single street with Cotterstock Hall located in the centre and St Andrew‚Äôs Church in the east. Cotterstock has a village hall.  In the media  In 2010, Cotterstock Hall was used as a film set for 'The Woman in Black'. Star Daniel Radcliffe said of the Hall: \\"Cotterstock Hall is a remarkable building bursting with Gothic grandeur ‚Äì perfect for The Woman In Black\\".

Its primary subsidiaries are CWT, a travel management company, and Carlson Private Capital Partners, a family office that manages the wealth of the owners. It previously held interests in hotels, including Radisson Hotels, and restaurants, including TGI Fridays. The company is owned by Barbara Carlson Gage and Marilyn Carlson Nelson, daughters of the founder, Curt Carlson. History =1938-1961; foundation as Gold Bond Stamp Company= Carlson was founded in 1938 by Curt Carlson. It was originally name the Gold Bond Stamp Company and started with a $55 loan Carlson received from his landlord during the Great Depression. Carlson used \\"Gold Bond Stamps\\", a loyalty program based on trading stamps, to provide consumer incentives for grocery stores, supermarkets, and gas stations. The stamps could be redeemed for various items such as patio furniture or a mink coat. During the 1950s, C.F. Carlson was the largest supplier of mink coats in the United States. =1962-2013; Expansion into hospitality industry= A Radisson Blu hotel in Frankfurt, Germany In 1962, Carlson bought into his first Radisson Hotel, a vintage property in Minneapolis named after French explorer Pierre-Esprit Radisson. The chain grew rapidly by franchising the name and taking management contracts for new hotels throughout the United States. The company was renamed Carlson Companies, Inc. in 1973. In 1975, Carlson ventured into the restaurant business by acquiring an interest in TGI Fridays, later taking full ownership in 1989. It also purchased Country Kitchen, a chain of family-style restaurants in 1977, later selling the brand in 1997. In 1981, it acquired E.F. MacDonald Motivation Co., another incentive management company, making the company the largest trading stamp company in the world. At that time, many employees were working 6 days per week and not receiving a higher pay than at similar companies with less demands. In 1986, the company also established the Country Inns & Suites brand. In 1994, Carlson and Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, a division of Accor, merged their travel agencies to form CWT, a travel management company. In 1997, Carlson acquired Regent Hotels & Resorts from Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. Carlson gained the rights to develop future hotels, while Four Seasons maintained management of 9 hotels. In Spring 1998, Curt Carlson named his daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson as his successor. He died in February 1999, 9 days after suffering a stroke. In 2000, the company acquired Park Inn by Radisson and Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts. In 2005, Carlson acquired 25% of Rezidor Hotel Group, a business partner of the hotel division in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) markets. Rezidor became a subsidiary of the Carlson hotel group in 2010, despite retaining its listing status. The hotel group then rebranded as Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group in January 2012. =2013 to present; divesting and foundation of family office= In May 2013, Diana Nelson assumed the chairmanship of the board of directors, succeeding her mother, Marilyn Carlson Nelson, who also continues to serve as chairman emeritus. Rautio retired in 2015, leading to the company having separate CEOs for the hotel and travel businesses until the hotel business was sold to HNA. The company sold TGI Fridays to Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners for a reported $800 million in 2014. Two years later, it sold its hotel division, including Rezidor Hotel Group, Country Inns & Suites by Carlson, Park Inn by Radisson, Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts, Radisson Hotels, Radisson Blu Hotels, and Radisson Red Hotels were sold to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The division was renamed Radisson Hotel Group in 2018. In 2018, the company launched a family office to invest its cash. It also renovated its headquarters.

The village has a population of 998. The parish includes the hamlets of West Compton, East Compton, Westholme, Beardly Batch and Cannards Grave. History Pilton is now almost from the sea but sits on the edge of the Somerset Levels, an area which has now been drained but was once a shallow tidal lake. According to legend in the 1st century, being a landing place then known as Pooltown, it is where Joseph of Arimathea landed in Britain . The parish of Pilton was part of the Whitstone Hundred. Cannard's Grave is located on the southern edge of Shepton Mallet. Local legend (of which there are several versions) says that, in the 17th century, the publican of the local inn, Giles Cannard (possibly also known as Tom the Taverner), engaged in criminal activity such as robbing, or aiding and abetting the robbery of, his guests, theft, smuggling and possibly forgery. His activities having been discovered, he either committed suicide or was convicted and hanged from the gibbet at the adjacent crossroads and buried nearby. Other explanations of the name include a tale that Kenred a pagan and uncle of King Ine who converted to Christianity was buried there. Perhaps the most likely story is that a thief convicted of sheep stealing was tried and hanged at the site. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Church St John the Baptist, Pilton Stained glass window in St John's church The present Norman and Medieval village church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, may stand on the site of an earlier wattle and daub church built by the early missionaries. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Listed buildings Tithe Barn The village has a Grade II* listed manor house and a Grade I listed tithe barn, which belonged to Glastonbury Abbey.

It is the oldest and largest grassroots volunteer organization chartered by the California Republican Party, and is the California affiliate of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA). The CRA can date its origin to the 1930s and was an early supporter of Governor Earl Warren but also an early opponent of Chief Justice Earl Warren, whom it believed had moved left from his gubernatorial days to his time on the court and so was regarded as far too liberal to merit support by conservatives. The CRA was largely supportive of the efforts of Barry Goldwater's Presidential bid and helped him finalize his nomination at the 1964 Republican National Convention held in San Francisco. Later that year it helped the cause of George Murphy, a former movie actor and close friend of Ronald Reagan in being elected to the United States Senate, and then helped Reagan himself to be elected Governor of California in 1966. The group claims to hold much of the responsibility for the \\"Reagan Revolution\\". Ronald Reagan often referred to CRA as the \\"Conscience of the Republican Party.\\" Unlike some other conservative political groups, it makes no pretense at being nonpartisan; the \\"CRA has been working to elect Republican candidates who stand unwaveringly for Republican principles,\\" according to their website. It is anti-abortion and pro-\\"family values\\" and it supports a limited-government agenda calling for lower taxes, less governmental regulation, and more personal freedom. In the 1990s it spawned a national organization based on its own efforts, the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, which now has affiliates in approximately forty states.

In other words, it remains itself under the charge conjugation which replaces particles with their corresponding antiparticles. All charges of a truly neutral particle must be equal to zero. This requires particles to not only be electrically neutral, but also requires that all of their other charges (like the colour charge) are neutral. Known examples of such elementary particles include photons, Z bosons, and Higgs bosons, along with the hypothetical neutralinos, sterile neutrinos, and gravitons. For a spin- particle such as the neutralino, being truly neutral implies being a Majorana fermion. Composite particles can also be truly neutral. A system composed of a particle forming a bound state with its antiparticle, such as the neutral pion (), is truly neutral. Such a state is called an ‚Äúonium‚Äù, another example of which is positronium, the bound state of an electron and a positron (). By way of contrast neutrinos are not truly neutral since they have a weak isospin of ¬±, or equivalently, a non-zero weak hypercharge, both of which are charge-like quantum numbers. (The example presumes on evidence to date, which gives no indication that neutrino are Majorana particles.)

He was the longest-serving captain of the national rugby union team, the All Blacks, until surpassed by Richie McCaw in 2014. Rugby writer Terry McLean considered him the All Blacks' greatest captain. Domestic career Owing to his early career as an agricultural cadet, which involved considerable travel around the country, Whineray played for six first-class teams, including Wairarapa, Mid Canterbury, Manawatu, Canterbury, Waikato, and finally his hometown team, Auckland, for whom he made 61 appearances between 1959 and 1966. He also played for the South Island, North Island, and New Zealand Universities sides. International career He first played for the All Blacks in 1957. The following year he became captain for the 1958 series against Australia at the young age of 23. He went on to play 77 matches for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1965, 67 of them as captain. These included 32 test matches, all but two of them as captain. He played mostly in the position of prop. Whineray was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport, especially to rugby football, in the 1962 New Year Honours, and he was named New Zealand Sportsperson of the Year in 1965. Later life After retiring from rugby, he gained a MBA from Harvard University, where he was a member of the Harvard Business School RFC. He returned to New Zealand in 1969 and started work at Alex Harvey Industries, which became Carter Holt Harvey. He rose to become deputy managing director, then chairman of the board of Carter Holt Harvey, by then a major New Zealand company, and retired from the board in 2003. He was the managing director of NZ Wool Marketing Corporation in 1973‚Äì74, chairman of the National Bank of New Zealand, and a director of Auckland International Airport and APN News & Media. He was chairman of the Hillary Commission, a sports funding body, from 1993 to 1998. He was the honorary Colonel Commandant of the New Zealand Special Air Service from 1997 to 2001. In the 1998 Queen's Birthday Honours, Whineray was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sport and business management. In November 2004, it was reported that Whineray was a top contender to replace Dame Silvia Cartwright as Governor-General in 2006. Bob Howitt has said that, \\"had he allowed his name to go forward, he would have become the Governor-General\\". He became the first New Zealander inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, being elected on 21 October 2007 (following the IRB World Cup in France) after a public vote. He died in Auckland in 2012, at the age of 77.

Tyvek is often used as housewrap, a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction, or as personal protective equipment against lethal viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The material is difficult to tear, but can easily be cut with scissors or a knife. Water vapor can pass through Tyvek, but liquid water cannot. All of these properties have led to Tyvek being used in a variety of applications. History Tyvek is a nonwoven product consisting of spun bond olefin fiber. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont textile company working in an experimental lab, who noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe. That fluff was a form of polyethylene, which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that was able to be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for commercial purposes in April 1967. As of 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale, and is often used for the construction of houses due to its ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through. In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field. = 21st century = In 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, The Dow Chemical Company to form DowDuPont. DowDupont currently manufactures Tyvek at the Spruance plant in Richmond, Virginia, and in Sandweiler-Contern, Luxembourg. In 2018, DowDuPont announced plans to expand the Tyvek production capacity of the Sandweiler-Contern factory.  Scientific characteristics and properties  Tyvek USPS Express Mail envelope = Adhesion and bonding = DuPont recommends starch, dextrin, casein, and animal-based adhesives over most synthetic-based adhesives, emphasizing the effectiveness of water-based and quick-drying glues as the best for bonding Tyvek both to itself and to a variety of substrates. DuPont also claims that the following adhesives are highly effective: * Ethylene/vinyl acetate * Acrylic pressure-sensitive tape * Solvent-based single-component polyurethane * Hot glue Heat sealing can be used to melt Tyvek and cause it to bond to itself, but this form of bonding tends to create puckers in the otherwise flat material. Dielectric bonding can be effective in some circumstances, as is ultrasonic welding. =Recycling= Though Tyvek superficially resembles paper (for example, it can be written and printed on), it is plastic, and it cannot be recycled with paper. Some Tyvek products are marked with the #2 resin-code for HDPE, and can be collected with plastic bottles as part of some municipal curbside recycling programs. DuPont runs a program in the United States where disposable clothing, coveralls, lab coats, medical packaging and other non-hazardous Tyvek disposable garments can be recycled, as well as providing a mail-in recycling program for envelopes. Recently, plastic bag recycling has become more prevalent. According to the American Chemistry Council, these plastic film drop-off locations accept Tyvek. = Properties of Tyvek = According to DuPont's Web site, the fibers are 0.5‚Äì10 Œºm (compared to 75 Œºm for a human hair). The nondirectional fibers (plexifilaments) are first spun and then bonded by heat and pressure, without binders.Product Handbook for DuPont Tyvek Tyvek is also: * Light weight * Class 1 flammability rating * Chemical resistant * Dimensional stabilized * Opaque * Neutral pH * Tear resistant Uses = Construction/engineering = Tyvek envelopes * Large sheets of Tyvek are frequently used as \\"housewrap,\\" to provide an air barrier between the outer cladding of a structure and the frame, insulation, etc., allowing water vapor to pass yet restricting air infiltration.DuPont: Tyvek Weatherization Systems archive Pdf * Tyvek is used in archery to construct waterproof target faces, replacing paper. * Tyvek was used to cover and protect the Reaction Control System (RCS) thruster ports from water and debris while the shuttle stack was exposed on the launchpad during the latter years of the Space Shuttle program.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120014272.pdf The Tyvek covers were dislodged shortly after ignition and before the shuttle cleared the tower, posing no strike risk as the shuttle was travelling below 100 MPH. * Tom Sachs used Tyvek for the outer shell of the spacesuits used in his Space Program series of artworks. = Government use = * Tyvek is used by the United States Postal Service for some of its Priority Mail and Express Mail envelopes * FedEx also uses it for some of its document envelopes. * New Zealand used it for its driver's licenses from 1986 to 1999. * Costa Rica (solely their 1000 colones bank note),Costa Rica Tyvek Envelopes the Isle of Man,Isle of Man Bradvek Banknotes and HaitiHaitian Tyvek Banknotes 1980 and 1982 issues have made banknotes from it. These banknotes are no longer in circulation and have become collectors' items. = Fashion/personal use = * Race bibs, or race numbers are often produced on Tyvek paper, so they are less likely to rip during competition. * Tyvek is often used in garment and other textile labeling due to high durability and washability. * Tyvek wristbands are used at festivals, conventions, and events where admission and security are concerns,uk.orakel.com as well as hospitals, resorts, nightclubs, schools, and reunions. * More recently fashion retailer and manufacturer American Apparel has included white Tyvek shorts as part of its range. * In 1976, fashion house Fiorucci made an entire collection out of Tyvek. * The ultralight backpacking community has begun to use Tyvek for the construction of extremely light yet durable backpacks. In 2012, The Open Company released a foldable city map made of one of the stiffer variants of Tyvek. * Increasingly, reused Tyvek material is being used by home crafters. Protective sleeves for Compact Discs and DVDs, tote bags, and origami wallets CD DVD DuPont White Tyvek Sleeves with 4\\" Clear Window and Flap (Automated Packaging Grade) 100 Pack Amazon also use Tyvek-containing materials. * Tyvek is also used as a durable fabric in shoes. Tyvek coveralls = Medical = * Tyvek is extensively used for laboratory and medical packaging as the material withstands conditions such as Gamma irradiation or Ethylene Oxide gas which are used to sterilize equipment and surgical devices. * NSW Police, Australia uses Tyvek overalls to preserve the integrity of forensic evidence at a crime scene, while also protecting \\"the wearer from the risk of exposure to biological substances, dirt and liquid splashes.\\" = Personal protective equipment (PPE) = * Tyvek coveralls are one-piece garments, usually white, commonly worn by mechanics, oil industry workers, painters, insulation installers, and laboratory and cleanroom workers where disposable, one-time use coverall is needed. They are also used for some light HAZMAT applications, such as asbestos and radiation work, but do not provide the protection of a full hazmat suit. Tychem is a sub-brand of Tyvek rated for a higher level of liquid protection, especially from chemicals. DuPont makes Tyvek clothing in different styles from laboratory coats and aprons to complete head-to-toe coveralls with hoods and booties. The latter was notably used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force as emergency limited CBRN gear during the Fukushima nuclear incident.Boosting SDF's Nuclear Accident Response Capabilities. Japan Security Watch. July 13th 2011. Accessed 11th October 2014. * Tyvek coveralls, coats or bodysuits are often used during pandemics for example in the 2013‚Äì2016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic or in the COVID-19 pandemic to protect health care workers from infection. The Tyvek suits which are most frequently used during the COVID-19 pandemic are sold between $5-$15 USD per piece. Due to a lack of sufficient stock of adequate PPE during the coronavirus crisis, Tyvek PPE became scarce in many places. Tyvek bodysuits are generally meant for one-time use. However, Tychem suits contaminated with the virus SARS-CoV-2 can be disinfected and reused a limited number of times.

History =Horse tram era= Horse tram on Oxford Road in 1893 The origins of Reading Transport can be traced back to the 19th century, when the privately owned Reading Tramways Company (part of the Imperial Tramways Company) was formed. The company was authorised to construct and operate a horse tram route on an east‚Äìwest alignment from Oxford Road through Broad Street in the town centre to Cemetery Junction. This route formed the core of what became known as the main line of the tram and trolleybus network. Construction started in January 1879, with the entire line open by May. A fleet of six single-decked cars were initially used, with 31 horses, providing a 20-minute frequency. The cars operated from a depot on the south side of the Oxford Road, immediately to the east of Reading West railway station. By the 1890s the whole fleet had been replaced by double-decked cars operating at a 10-minute frequency. The company made several proposals to add routes and electrify the system, but none of these were implemented, and in 1899 the borough corporation decided to purchase the system. The purchase deal was completed on 31 October 1901, and Reading Corporation Tramways came into being. The corporation set out about first extending, and then electrifying the system. The extensions were completed by December 1902, and the last horse cars ran in July of the following year. =Electric tram era= Reading Corporation Tramways opening ceremony on 22 July 1903 The new electric trams started operating in July 1903. Extensions were constructed to the Wokingham Road and London Road (both from Cemetery Junction), and new routes added to Whitley, Caversham Road, Erleigh Road and Bath Road. The trams operated from a new depot in Mill Lane, a site that was to remain Reading Transport's main depot until it was demolished to make way for The Oracle shopping mall in 1998. The electric tram services were originally operated by 30 four-wheeled double decked cars supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. In 1904, six bogie cars and a water car (used for keeping down the dust on the streets) were added to the fleet, from the same manufacturer. No further trams were acquired, and a planned extension from the Caversham Road terminus across Caversham Bridge to Caversham itself was abandoned because of the outbreak of World War I. The war also led to a significant maintenance backlog. In 1919, Reading Corporation started operating its first motor buses. These ran from Caversham Heights to Tilehurst, running over the tram lines and beyond the tram termini. Because of the state of the track, the Bath Road tram route was abandoned in 1930, followed by the Erleigh Road route in 1932. Eventually it was decided that the tramways should be abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, operating over extended routes. The last tram ran on the Caversham Road to Whitley route in July 1936, and the last car on the main line ran in May 1939. =Trolleybus era= Trolleybus in Newtown in 1965 The first trolleybus wiring erected was a training loop on Erleigh Road, which opened in early 1936. This loop was never used in public service, and was subsequently dismantled. Public service commenced on 18 July 1936, on a route replacing the tram route from Caversham Road to Whitley Street. In May 1939, the remaining tram routes from Oxford Road to Wokingham Road and London Road were converted to trolleybus operation, with a short extension from Wokingham Road to the Three Tuns, and a much longer extension from the Oxford Road through the centre of Tilehurst to the Bear Inn. The extended main line, from the Three Tuns to the Bear, still exists today as bus route 17, the town's busiest and most frequent route, and the first to be designated a premier route. During World War II a trolleybus branch was constructed from the Oxford Road to Kentwood Hill, enabling trolleybuses to replace motor buses with a consequential saving in precious oil-based fuel. In 1949 the Whitley Street line was extended to Whitley Wood and Northumberland Avenue, and a short branch was built to Reading General station. Subsequent short extensions took the system to its full extent, with the Kentwood route running to Armour Hill and the Northumberland Avenue line running to the junction with Whitley Wood Road. By 1965, most UK trolleybus systems had closed, and the manufacturers of the overhead equipment gave notice that they would cease production. At the same time the trolleybuses were criticised in the local press because they cost more to operate than motor buses and were inflexible, even though the trolleybuses were profitable (Reading's motor buses made a loss), faster and less polluting. Reading Corporation decided to abandon the trolleybus system, and the routes were phased out between January 1967 and November 1968. The UK's first contra-flow bus lane was instigated along Kings Road, when that road was made one-way in the early 1960s. The trolleybuses continued to operate two-way, as it was considered uneconomic to erect wiring on the new inbound route, London Road. The concept of the contra-flow bus lane was proved successful, and adopted in other places for motor buses. =Expansion and competition= Reading Transport offices in 1985 (now The Oracle shopping centre) The Transport Act 1980 deregulated long distance bus services. Reading Transport took advantage of this new freedom to start a service from Reading through London to Southend. The service was numbered X1 and was run jointly with Southend Transport. In 1982 the X1 was shortened to run from Reading to Aldgate in East London, under the Goldline brand, and joint operation ceased. As a result of the legislation that accompanied the deregulation of local bus services in 1986, the operations of Reading Transport were transferred to Reading Transport Limited, an \\"arms length\\" company whose shares were held by Reading Borough Council. Bus deregulation also meant that the local council no longer had any power to regulate the routes and fares of Reading Transport, nor could they prevent other operators from starting competitive services within the borough. In 1991 Reading Transport was rebranded Reading Buses.New name Commercial Motor 2 May 1991 In 1992 Reading Transport acquired the Reading and Newbury operations of BeeLine, one of the privatised successors to the state- owned Alder Valley. These acquisitions led to Reading Transport operating buses in Newbury, and in the rural areas around Reading and Newbury, for the first time. Additionally, BeeLine had operated a Reading to London service under the LondonLink name, and that was merged into the Goldline service and the resulting service renamed London Line. The Goldline name was retained for use by Reading Transport's non-scheduled service business. The London Line service ceased in 2000. Reading Buses faced competition on Reading urban routes from 1994, when Reading Mainline, an independent company, started operations with AEC Routemasters acquired from London Regional Transport. Labour shortages created problems for the competitor, and Reading Buses acquired Reading Mainline in 1998. Reading Transport continued to operate the Routemasters under the Reading Mainline brand until they were finally withdrawn in July 2000. In December 2017, Reading Buses started to serve London again when it took over Green Line Coaches route 702 from Bracknell to the Green Line Coach Station at Victoria via Windsor and Slough from First Berkshire & The Thames Valley. In January 2018 Reading Buses took over 2 routes (2/5), and won Slough Borough Council tenders for an evening service (4) and a Sunday service (6) from First Berkshire & The Thames Valley.702 Greenline Reading Buses In September 2018, Reading Buses purchased Newbury & District from Weavaway.Newbury & District Reading Buses acquires Newbury & District operation The companies have worked together in the past, most noticeably on the Jet Black 1 service which operates between Reading and Newbury. In March 2019, Courtney Buses was purchased with 57 buses.Reading Buses agree terms to purchase Courtney Buses Bracknell News 6 March 2019Reading Buses buys out Courtney Buses Wokingham Paper 6 March 2019 In November 2019, routes 2 (which had already been withdrawn as a result of too much competition from Courtney in May 2018, but added back into the company after the purchase in March 2019) and 5 in Slough and Windsor were transferred to the Courtney Buses division, with 2 other routes, which Courtney had taken over from First Berkshire & The Thames Valley (10/15) also grouped in a similar manner. However, First won the tenders for the evening service 4 and Sunday service 6 back.https://cbwmagazine.com/thames-valley-brand-combines- with-courtney-buses/https://www.reading-buses.co.uk/thames-valley-buses-and- courtney-buses-merge =Route branding= Previous Logo Optare Excel LowRider in 1999 in a variant of the livery used until the introduction of premier routes Since 2004, Reading Buses and Reading Borough Council have made a significant investment in upgrading the quality of Reading's main urban bus routes. In autumn of that year, Reading Buses introduced its first branded Premier Route in the form of the number 17, running between the Three Tuns on Wokingham Road and the Bear Inn at Tilehurst via the town centre and Oxford Road, and the linear descendant of the old main line. This was intended as the first in a series of such routes, each providing a weekday daytime frequency of between 3 and 8 buses per hour. Each premier route, or group of routes, would be allocated a distinctive colour, to be used on the buses on that route, and also on maps and other publicity. Since then the premier route concept has been rolled out on most of Reading's urban routes. In April 2009, a similar concept was introduced to some of Reading Buses' longer distance rural routes. These were rebranded as Vitality Routes, using specially branded green and silver or red and silver buses. In 2014, these too were changed to a colour brand, becoming 'Lime Routes'. Most longer distance and interurban services now have animal related branding, with the lion to Bracknell, the leopard to Wokingham, and the tiger to Fleet. The lime brand is still retained on the service to Mortimer. Current operations =Reading Buses= Reading Transport operates public service buses under the Reading Buses brand throughout the town of Reading, and along a number of corridors out to other local towns. All routes have a colour scheme, a concept first introduced in 2004 with the introduction of 'Premier Routes', where each route or group of routes allocated a distinctive colour. These colours are used on the buses used on that route, and also on maps and other publicity. Urban town area routes provide a weekday daytime frequency of between 2 and 8 buses per hour, depending on the route. Five of the urban routes now operate 24 hours a day, reflecting the level of demand for local buses around the clock: * Emerald 5 and 6 to Whitley * Purple 17 to Tilehurst * Claret 21 to Lower Earley * Yellow 26 to Calcot/IKEA The \\"Lion\\" branded route in Reading Out of town routes operate at lower frequency, with between one and four buses an hour. These operate out as far as Newbury, Wokingham, Bracknell and Fleet and have animal- related brandingLondon Buses On the Go http://londonbusesonthego.blogspot.com/2017/12/introducing-reading-buses.html: *Leopard 3/8/9 to Wokingham and Spencers Wood *Lion X4/4 to Wokingham and Bracknell *Tiger 7 to Riseley & Fleet. Reading Buses also operate the services to three Park and Ride sites, to the South and East of the town. =Kennections and Newbury & District= Following a contract win from West Berkshire Council, Reading Buses introduced the Kennections brand in Newbury in September 2016. These routes were previously run by Newbury & District, the bus service trading name for Weavaway Travel, who in turn took them over from Reading Buses' now-defunct Newbury Buses brand. All drivers were TUPEd to Reading Buses. In September 2018, Reading Buses purchased Newbury & District from Weavaway. Although the brands will remain separate for now this may change in the future. =Thames Valley Buses and Courtney Buses= In December 2017, it was announced that Reading Buses was to take on three services withdrawn by First Berkshire & The Thames Valley in the Slough area. A fourth route was later added. The Thames Valley Buses name, historically associated with Thames Valley Traction, was used for the new services.http://www.route- one.net/articles/Bus_routes/Thames_Valley_brand_resurrected Operation began on 20 January 2018. In March 2019, Reading Buses purchased Courtney Buses as part of their expansion across Berkshire. In November 2019, the Thames Valley and Courtney Buses brands began to be combined, which will be a gradual process in the next couple of years, with Slough and Windsor being the first areas to change over to Thames Valley, adding two more routes. However, a retendering of contracts by Slough Borough Council saw the two tendered routes won back by First. =Greenline= In December 2017, Reading Buses announced they would be taking over the Greenline 702 from First Berkshire & The Thames Valley, since running the service they have introduced a new service to Heathrow using route number 703, along with the purchase of 5 Optare MetroDecker for route 702 =National Express= Reading buses operates the National Express Woking 925 service under contract. This is operated from an out station at the old National Express Sipson Road depot, West Drayton now owned by CCH. Obsolete brands =Newbury Buses= 164px Newbury Buses Dennis Dart, pre \\"Newbury & District\\" competition Until August 2011, Reading Transport operated public service buses in the town of Newbury and the surrounding rural area under the \\"Newbury Buses\\" brand. Two routes were branded using the same Vitality Route brand that was used by Reading Buses, and provide weekday daytime frequencies of two buses per hour. Another longer distance route, to Basingstoke, was jointly operated with Stagecoach in Hampshire and branded as The Link. When Reading withdrew from all commercial and tendered work in the Newbury area, the majority of work passed to Newbury & District. The Link is now operated by Stagecoach in Hampshire on a revised timetable to reflect the Stagecoach depot being in Basingstoke. Jet Black 1 was subcontracted to Weavaway Travel in 2011, using several Alexander Dennis Enviro400s, which are owned by Weavaway but are in a route-branded version of Reading Buses livery and are on the Reading fleet system. Additional Enviro400s owned by Weavaway in an all-over black livery are also able to be used on the route. =Goldline Travel= Goldline logo Reading Buses used the Goldline Travel name for its non-public- service bus operations, including services operated under contract for various local employers. Goldline Travel was also responsible for the operation of Fastrack and Daytrack park and ride services and Nighttrack night bus services, all of which are operated under contract to Reading Borough Council. Goldline Travel had a two-tone green colour scheme, although most services were operated by vehicles in colour schemes specified by the contracting organisation. Unlike services run by Reading Buses, Goldline gave change on their routes. This was mainly for the benefit of visitors who are more likely to use routes such as park-and-ride. In May 2008, Goldline won the contract to operate route 142 from Checkendon, Woodcote and Purley to Reading; the route was previously operated by Thames Travel. However, when the route was next tendered, in May 2012, the contract reverted to Thames Travel. In February 2009, the private hire services run by Goldline ceased, and the coaches were all sold.Bus Zone ‚Äì Updates May 2008. Retrieved 29 May 2008 =Loddon Bridge Park & Ride= In 2015, Loddon Bridge Park & Ride route 500 ceased and the site was closed, having been superseded by Winnersh Triangle Park & Ride, following the completion of the new site by Reading and Wokingham Borough Councils. Fleet As of December 2018, the fleet consists of 192 buses.Fleet List Reading Buses December 2018 Fuels Ethanol-fueled Scania OmniCity in May 2008 in the livery it carried when used on the 17 Reading Buses has a history of experimenting with biofuels, including biodiesel and alcohol fuel. By 2008, all but one of Reading's bus fleet was fuelled by a mix of 5% biodiesel and 95% conventional diesel. In late 2007, Reading Buses placed an order with Scania for 14 ethanol-fuelled double decker buses to replace the existing fleet of biodiesel-powered vehicles operating premier route 17. At the time the order was placed, this was the largest order for ethanol-fuelled buses in the UK. These buses started work on 26 May 2008. In October 2009, it was discovered that instead of the bio-ethanol fuel having been sourced from sugar beet grown in the English county of Norfolk (as had been advertised), it was actually made from wood pulp imported from Sweden. On learning this, Reading Borough councillors launched an investigation into how they and the Reading Transport Board could have been deceived. All the ethanol-powered buses have since been converted to run on the same bio-diesel mix as the rest of the fleet. Reading Buses had 31 hybrid (diesel-battery-electric) buses, but now only has 14 serving routes Lion 4/X4 and Yellow 26 routes. the other 17 have different positions within the company, first was fire victim (203) after the fire the bus was scrapped, then (205) had a drivetrain replacement with a magtec hybrid system leaving the rest which was now redundant Purple 17s, they have since had a full refurbishment and have also been converted to diesel coupled with a ZF gearbox and now serve routes Sky Blue 15/16 & Berry 23/24. In May 2013, 20 buses powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) were introduced. These are used on the Greenwave routes, Leopard 3/8/9, Tiger 7 and Bronze 11. A further 14 vehicles arrived in 2014, which work the Lime 2, Leopard 3/8/9 and Pink 22/25. One member of this fleet, No 420, holds the land speed record for a regular service bus, having achieved 80.82 mph under test conditions in May 2015. It carries a special cow print livery reflecting the fact that the compressed natural gas is, at source, methane derived from cow faeces. Buses (701-705) used on the Royal Blue 33 route, are the first CNG-fuelled double- deckers these feature Enviro 400 MMC bodywork.https://images.reading- buses.co.uk/downloads/May%202018.pdf Bus 703 being named the \\"Richard Wilding OBE\\". In 2018 a further 17 (706-722) CNG-fuelled double deckers arrived for Purple 17, unlike the previous order for CNG Buses these are fitted with Enviro 400 CITY bodywork.

Yoshinkan Aikido is often called the \\"hard\\" style of aikido because the training methods are a product of Shioda's grueling life before the war. Shioda named his dojo \\"Yoshinkan\\" after a dojo of the same name that was built by his father, a physician, who wanted to improve both physical and spiritual health.Shioda, G. Aikido Jinsei: My Life in Aikido. Trans. Payet & Johnston. The Yoshinkan style is currently the second largest aikido organization worldwide.Pranin, S. \\"Morihei Ueshiba and Gozo Shioda .\\" Aikido Journal, December 2011. Style As a style of aikido, Yoshinkan is more akin to the pre-war aikibudo techniques taught by Morihei Ueshiba, and therefore also generally closer to aikijujutsu than those styles of aikido developed after the war. The unusual emphasis placed on correct form prior to practicing correct flow and timing further contributes to its image as a \\"hard\\" style. Gozo Shioda created a structured method in which beginning students would learn the foundation techniques. Techniques are performed by a pair of students called uke (Âèó„Åë, the partner on whom the technique is performed) and shite (‰ªïÊâã, the partner who performs the technique). They are categorized by elements such as the initiating attack, the applicable control and whether it is a pin or throw. They are further divided into two groups called ichi (first) and ni (second) techniques. Ichi techniques have a feeling of the energy moving towards uke, while ni techniques have a feeling of energy moving towards shite. For example, in an ichi technique, shite would move in the same direction as a pull by uke, while in a ni technique, shite would divert or pivot away from a push by uke. The current method of breaking the techniques into steps and the kihon dosa were developed in order to facilitate teaching beginners in a group. The kenshusei codified many of these methods in consultation with Gozo Shioda, especially Kyoichi Inoue and Takashi Kushida. To remove stiffness from techniques taught in this way, practitioners over the rank of shodan also practice timing and flow. Techniques kokyunage performed by Yoshinkan practitioners (Chris Crampton Sensei) Yoshinkan Aikido has some 150 kihon waza (lit. \\"basic techniques\\"), which are practised repeatedly and designed to teach principles of movement, balance, timing, etc. In addition to set techniques, the style includes kokyunage (lit. \\"breath throws\\"), or techniques in which nage attacks and uke makes a non-mandatory, short and decisive response. As students progress, they begin to practice jiyu waza (lit. free techniques), which is a time-limited free-form attack and defense. In higher grades, jiyu-waza is performed against multiple attackers and/or attackers with weapons. Yoshinkan students do not normally practice the randori free-form found in other styles of aikido. The syllabus contains a few weapons forms, although they are rarely practised outside the hombu dojo, where they are taught to senshusei students. Jiyu-waza for yudansha includes free-form techniques against sword and knife, and some Yoshinkan dojos teach knife take-away techniques. Some Yoshinkan dojos offer aiki-ken classes (classes in which aikido principles are investigated through sword practice) and some offer non-aikido weapons training, such as iaido, concurrently with aikido classes. Like many styles of aikido, Yoshinkan eschews competition; instead, it emphasizes self-defence applications. Yoshinkan aikido is one of the martial arts that has been taught to the Tokyo police. Besides the usual attention to distance, timing and balance, the Yoshinkan style places particularly heavy emphasis on stance and basic movements. Yoshinkan‚Äôs distinctive stance, or kamae (lit. \\"posture\\" in Japanese), stresses the position of feet and hips. Yoshinkan aikido practitioners stand with hips and shoulders square to the front, the front foot pointing outward and the back foot pointing about 90 degrees to the front foot. Kamae is the foundation of all Yoshinkan aikido techniques and practitioners of Yoshinkan aikido strive to perfect their kamae so that their overall technique will be strengthened. Along with kamae there are 6 kihon dosa (lit. \\"basic movements\\") which are considered to be central for the 150 basic techniques. Yoshinkan aikido students practice these diligently to understand how to move their kamae around to put themselves in a strong position. Without proper form in one's basic movements one's aikido will not be as effective. Senshusei course In 1990, Gozo Shioda founded the International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation (IYAF) to facilitate the learning of Yoshinkan aikido outside Japan. Under current dojo director Susumu Chino, the Yoshinkan hombu dojo, located in Shinjuku Tokyo, runs an annual 11-month intensive course called the Senshusei course, in which students from Japan and foreign nations train with the Tokyo Metropolitan Riot Police. The book Angry White Pyjamas by Robert Twigger is based on the author's experiences during the course. In addition to the Senshusei Course, a number of other Uchi-deshi and specialized training programs have arisen in recent years. For example, Shihan Tsuneo Ando offers live-in training near Tokyo, and Shihan Jacques Payet offers an 11-month training course at Mugenjuku dojo in Kyoto.Aikido Mugenjuku Kenshusei Course Former Yoshinkan Branches Yoshokai aikido is an offshoot of Yoshinkan Aikido based in the United States founded by Takashi Kushida, a direct student of Gozo Shioda and a contemporary of Kyoichi Inoue. Then-9th dan Kyoichi Inoue, shihan, resigned from the Yoshinkan in March 2006 following an internal dispute, later establishing his own branch, Aikido Shinwakan (ÂêàÊ∞£ÈÅìË¶™ÂíåÈ§®). Following Inoue-shihan's departure, Tsutomu Chida, 8th dan and then-dojocho of Yoshinkan hombu dojo, also broke away, establishing Aikido Renshinkai (ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅìÈå¨Ë∫´‰ºö) in 2008.

Also, their menu cover page says, \\"Thank Golly-G It's Friday\\". History A TGI Fridays in Manahawkin, New Jersey that opened in 2003 with the new design, seen in November 2006. A TGI Fridays in Christ Church, Barbados in November 2010 (closed in August 2013). TGI Fridays in Waterbury, Connecticut in June 2014. Alan Stillman opened the first TGI Fridays restaurant in 1965, in New York. He lived in a neighborhood with many airline stewardesses, fashion models, secretaries, and other young, single people on the East Side of Manhattan near the Queensboro Bridge, and hoped that opening a bar would help him meet women. At the time, Stillman's choices for socializing were non-public cocktail parties or \\"guys' beer-drinking hangout\\" bars that women usually did not visit; he recalled that \\"there was no public place for people between, say, twenty-three to thirty-seven years old, to meet.\\" He sought to recreate the comfortable cocktail party atmosphere in public despite having no experience in the restaurant business. With $5,000 of his own money and $5,000 borrowed from his mother, Stillman purchased a bar he often visited, The Good Tavern at the corner of 63rd Street and First Avenue, and renamed it TGI Fridays after the expression \\"Thank God it's Friday!\\" from his years at Bucknell University. The new restaurant, which opened on March 15, 1965, served standard American cuisine, bar food, and alcoholic beverages, but emphasized food quality and preparation. The exterior featured a red-and-white striped awning and blue paint; the Gay Nineties interior included American Made Tiffany Style Lamps, mostly by the Somers Family, wooden floors, Bentwood chairs, and striped tablecloths; and the bar area added brass rails and stained glass. The employees were young and wore red-and-white striped soccer shirts, and every time someone had a birthday, the entire restaurant crew came around with a cake and sang TGI Fridays' traditional birthday song. Footage of interviews with patrons from this TGI Fridays was featured in Robert Downey Sr.'s film No More Excuses (1968). The first location closed in 1994 and is now a British pub called \\"Baker Street\\"; the brass rails are still there. Although Malachy McCourt's nearby eponymous bar preceded TGI Fridays and Stillman credited the media for creating the term, he had unintentionally created one of the first singles bars. It benefited from the near-simultaneous availability of the birth-control pill and Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique: TGI Fridays was one of the first to use promotions such as ladies' night, and Stillman achieved his hopes of meeting women; \\"Have you seen the movie Cocktail? Tom Cruise played me!...Why do girls want to date the bartender? To this day, I‚Äôm not sure that I get it.\\" He and the restaurant benefited from its location‚Äîaccording to Stillman, 480 stewardesses lived in the apartment building next door‚Äîand received publicity in national magazines. TGI Fridays became so popular that it had to install ropes to create an area for those waiting in line, also unusual at the time for a restaurant. A competitor, Maxwell's Plum, opened across the street, and others soon followed. The former TGI Fridays logo used until 2013. It is still used in older locations. With fellow Bucknell graduate Ben Benson, Stillman opened other restaurants, including Tuesday's, Thursday's, Wednesday's, and Ice Cream Sunday's. Franchising of TGI Fridays began two years after the Manhattan location opened, in Memphis, Tennessee's Overton Square district; that location has since closed. In 1971, Daniel R. Scoggin acquired the rights to eight major midwest cities. In 1972, he opened with the first of a new prototype in Dallas. The raised square bar and multilevel dining became the company standard. Dallas doubled the sales and tripled profits of TGI Fridays previous best. Families began visiting the new suburban locations during the day for casual food; \\"it took six or seven years, but T.G.I. Fridays became a very different animal\\", Stillman said. Attracted by this performance, he merged into the Dallas franchise forming TGI Fridays, Inc., and Scoggin was the CEO for the next 15 years. Scoggin is credited with the then-new 200 seat prototype as well as many of the TGI Fridays innovations including a large from scratch menu, potato skins, bartender Olympics, and frozen drinks. The company was sold to Carlson Companies in 1975. With this sale, Stillman and the original investors departed. Stillman kept the original location, and now married, founded Smith & Wollensky in 1977 with Benson. Scoggin continued as CEO on an earn-out contract and finalized his sale in 1980.\\"Handbook of Marketing Research Methodologies for Hospitality and Tourism\\", Dr. Ronald A. Nykiel, 2007High Profile, \\"Dan Scoggin\\", The Dallas Morning News, Sunday, January 27, 1985, Section E When the sale was finalized, Scoggin signed a new contract to continue as the company's CEO. When the company was passing through the 100-store mark, it issued an initial public offering in 1983 with Goldman Sachs. Scoggin developed the first international franchise and the template for future international development. The first restaurant was opened in the UK with Whitbread PLC. Prior to Scoggin's departure in 1986, the company was positioned to appeal to a broader consumer profile. Alcohol consumption was de-emphasized, and quality was emphasized over quantity. The company became privately held again in 1989. The focus was then switched from singles to families. A brand extension, which features the TGI Fridays concept combined with the atmosphere of a sports bar, called \\"Fridays Front Row Sports Grill\\", is found at two Major League Baseball stadiums which each overlook the playing field: Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona and Miller Park in Milwaukee. Historically, the chain's highest grossing location is at Haymarket Leicester Square, which opened in 1992 in Central London. The Haymarket branch is also regarded as the \\"most popular\\" branch as well as the most successful financially. In October 2009, Haymarket broke the world record for biggest profit made in any week, throughout TGI Fridays' history, and it has been home to several past winners from the bartenders Olympics, a contest started by Scoggin. On May 20, 2014, TGI Fridays was resold to Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners. In October 2019, TriArtisan bought out Sentinel's remaining stake. =Controversy= In 2013, as part of \\"Operation Swill\\", investigators in New Jersey raided 17 TGI Fridays franchised restaurants owned by The Briad Group. They found that the bars were replacing premium brand alcoholic beverages with lower-cost brands yet charging patrons for the more expensive liquor.

It is unknown whether or not the frames are still up or taken down. Franchisees TGI Fridays is a franchising operation, with franchisees owning most of the outlets. The largest franchisee is The Briad Group in New Jersey.The Briad Group, Hoovers ‚Äì accessed January 10, 2010 Whitbread PLC was a major international franchisee. Up until 2007, Whitbread had 45 locations in the UK. On January 17, 2007, Whitbread sold operating rights of all 45 restaurants back to T.G.I.

Design A TGI Fridays in Easton, Pennsylvania that uses the new design, seen in February 2019. TGI Fridays in Goodlettsville, Tennessee in July 2009 (closed in 2019). The newer TGI Fridays franchises (as well as redesigned restaurants) are more contemporary, with wallpaper, granite exteriors, and red-and-white striped lamps instead of Tiffany. The exteriors have stucco, the entrance doors have \\"F\\"-shaped handles, and a metal cup above the door has a stripe saying \\"In Here, It's always Friday\\". The logo design was evolved in 2013 by Jane MacDowall and her creative team in Scotland. Most TGI Fridays have a propeller and a rowing scull on display as part of their antiques, which are actually a part of a story told to all TGI Fridays employees; the scull always contains a pair of saddle shoes and a bottle of champagne to remind employees of the value of teamwork, leadership, and celebrating success. The propeller is always above or near the bar. The thought is that the bar \\"propels\\" the restaurant.  Menu  Fridays has a large menu with an emphasis on alcoholic beverages. TGI Fridays formerly served Atkins-approved appetizers, entr√©es, and desserts. In 2006, the Atkins name was removed from the menu, but the restaurant continues to offer both low-carbohydrate and low-fat menu items. The UK and US menus offer gluten-free items. Global operations TGI Fridays currently has over 870 restaurants in around 60 countries (excluding the United States).

One Billion Votes campaign was a non- partisan campaign initiated by Tata Tea, and Janaagraha to encourage citizens to vote in the 2009 Indian general election. The campaign was a non-partisan campaign initiated by Anal Saha.  Philippines  In the Philippines, barangay elections (elections for positions in the barangay or village) are nonpartisan. The certificates of candidacies, which the candidates sign under oath, say that they are not a member of any political party. The nonpartisanism of barangay elections have been challenged lately, though, as some candidates are members of political parties. Barangay Captains and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK, youth councils) chairmen in a municipality or city elect among themselves their representative to the local legislature. In deadlocked or hung legislatures, votes from the nominally nonpartisan representatives of barangay captains and SK chairmen hold the balance of power. United States Historian Sean Wilentz argues that from the days of George Washington's farewell address, to Senator Barack Obama's speech at the Democratic national convention in 2004, politicians have called upon Americans to move beyond parties. Wilentz calls this the post-partisan style, and argues that \\"the antiparty current is by definition antidemocratic, as political parties have been the only reliable electoral vehicles for advancing the ideas and interests of ordinary voters\\".p. 28 However, nonpartisan elections are quite common at the local level, primarily in an effort to keep national issues from being mixed up with local issues. Today, nonpartisan elections are generally held for municipal and county offices, especially school board, and are also common in the election of judges. The unicameral Legislature of Nebraska is the only state legislature that is entirely officially nonpartisan; additionally, the bicameral Fono of American Samoa is the only territorial legislature that is officially nonpartisan. Although elections may be officially nonpartisan, in some elections (usually involving larger cities or counties, as well as the Nebraska unicameral) the party affiliations of candidates are generally known, most commonly by the groups endorsing a particular candidate (e.g., a candidate endorsed by a labor union would be generally affiliated with the Democratic Party, while a candidate endorsed by a business coalition would be generally affiliated with the Republican Party). =Churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations= Churches and charities in the United States are mainly formed under US Internal Revenue Service tax code 501(c)(3) non-profit organization regulations.

Barthes's essay argues against traditional literary criticism's practice of incorporating the intentions and biographical context of an author in an interpretation of a text, and instead argues that writing and creator are unrelated. The title is a pun on Le Morte d'Arthur (The Death of Arthur), a 15th-century compilation of smaller Arthurian legend stories, written by Sir Thomas Malory. The essay's first English-language publication was in the American journal Aspen, no. 5‚Äì6 in 1967; the French debut was in the magazine Manteia, no. 5 (1968). The essay later appeared in an anthology of Barthes's essays, Image-Music-Text (1977), a book that also included his \\"From Work To Text\\". Content In his essay, the author argues against the method of reading and criticism that relies on aspects of the author's identity to distill meaning from the author's work. In this type of criticism against which he argues, the experiences and biases of the author serve as a definitive \\"explanation\\" of the text. For Barthes, however, this method of reading may be apparently tidy and convenient but is actually sloppy and flawed: \\"To give a text an author\\" and assign a single, corresponding interpretation to it \\"is to impose a limit on that text.\\" Readers must thus, according to Barthes, separate a literary work from its creator in order to liberate the text from interpretive tyranny (a notion similar to Erich Auerbach's discussion of narrative tyranny in biblical parables).Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, trans. Willard R. Trask. Princeton, 1953, repr. 1974 \\"Chapter 1\\" Each piece of writing contains multiple layers and meanings. In a well-known passage, Barthes draws an analogy between text and textiles, declaring that a \\"text is a tissue [or fabric] of quotations,\\" drawn from \\"innumerable centers of culture,\\" rather than from one, individual experience. The essential meaning of a work depends on the impressions of the reader, rather than the \\"passions\\" or \\"tastes\\" of the writer; \\"a text's unity lies not in its origins,\\" or its creator, \\"but in its destination,\\" or its audience. No longer the focus of creative influence, the author is merely a \\"scriptor\\" (a word Barthes uses expressively to disrupt the traditional continuity of power between the terms \\"author\\" and \\"authority\\"). The scriptor exists to produce but not to explain the work and \\"is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, [and] is not the subject with the book as predicate.\\" Every work is \\"eternally written here and now,\\" with each re-reading, because the \\"origin\\" of meaning lies exclusively in \\"language itself\\" and its impressions on the reader. Barthes notes that the traditional critical approach to literature raises a thorny problem: how can we detect precisely what the writer intended? His answer is that we cannot. He introduces this notion of intention in the epigraph to the essay, taken from Honor√© de Balzac's story Sarrasine in which a male protagonist mistakes a castrato for a woman and falls in love with him. When, in the passage, the character dotes over his perceived womanliness, Barthes challenges his own readers to determine who is speaking, and about what. \\"Is it Balzac the author professing 'literary' ideas on femininity? Is it universal wisdom? Romantic psychology? ... We can never know.\\" Writing, \\"the destruction of every voice,\\" defies adherence to a single interpretation or perspective. (Barthes returned to Sarrasine in his book S/Z, where he gave the story a rigorous close reading.) Acknowledging the presence of this idea (or variations of it) in the works of previous writers, Barthes cited in his essay the poet St√©phane Mallarm√©, who said that \\"it is language which speaks.\\" He also recognized Marcel Proust as being \\"concerned with the task of inexorably blurring ... the relation between the writer and his characters\\"; the Surrealist movement for employing the practice of \\"automatic writing\\" to express \\"what the head itself is unaware of\\"; and the field of linguistics as a discipline for \\"showing that the whole of enunciation is an empty process.\\" Barthes's articulation of the death of the author is a radical and drastic recognition of this severing of authority and authorship. Instead of discovering a \\"single 'theological' meaning (the 'message' of the Author-God),\\" readers of a text discover that writing, in reality, constitutes \\"a multi-dimensional space,\\" which cannot be \\"deciphered,\\" only \\"disentangled.\\" \\"Refusing to assign a 'secret', an ultimate meaning\\" to text \\"liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases‚Äîreason, science, law.\\"Roland Barthes's \\"The Death of the Author\\" Influences and overview Ideas presented in \\"The Death of the Author\\" were anticipated to some extent by New Criticism, a school of literary criticism important in the United States from the 1940s to the 1970s. New Criticism differs from Barthes's theory of critical reading because it attempts to arrive at more authoritative interpretations of texts. Nevertheless, the crucial New Critical precept of the \\"intentional fallacy\\" declares that a poem does not belong to its author; rather, \\"it is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.\\"William Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley (1946). \\"The Intentional Fallacy\\". Sewanee Review, vol. 54 (1946): 468‚Äì488. Revised and republished in The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry, University of Kentucky Press, 1954: 3‚Äì18. Barthes himself stated that the difference between his theory and New Criticism comes in the practice of \\"disentangling\\". Barthes's work has much in common with the ideas of the \\"Yale school\\" of deconstructionist critics, which numbered among its proponents Paul de Man and Barbara Johnson in the 1970s, although they are not inclined to see meaning as the production of the reader. Barthes, like the deconstructionists, insists upon the disjointed nature of texts, their fissures of meaning and their incongruities, interruptions, and breaks. A. D. Nuttall's essay \\"Did Meursault Mean to Kill the Arab? The Intentional Fallacy Fallacy\\" (Critical Quarterly 10:1‚Äì2, June 1968, pp. 95‚Äì106) exposes the logical flaws in the \\"Intentional fallacy\\" argument. Michel Foucault also addressed the question of the author in critical interpretation. In his 1969 essay \\"What is an Author?\\", he developed the idea of \\"author function\\" to explain the author as a classifying principle within a particular discursive formation. Foucault did not mention Barthes in his essay but its analysis has been seen as a challenge to Barthes's depiction of a historical progression that will liberate the reader from domination by the author. Jacques Derrida paid ironic homage to Barthes's \\"The Death of the Author\\" in his essay \\"The Deaths of Roland Barthes\\". Literary theorist Se√°n Burke dedicated an entire book to opposing \\"The Death of the Author\\", pointedly called The Death and Return of the Author. J. C. Carlier, in the satirical essay \\"Roland Barthes' Resurrection of the Author and Redemption of Biography\\" (Cambridge Quarterly 29:4, 2000, pp. 386‚Äì393), argues that the essay \\"The Death of the Author\\" is the litmus test of critical competence. Those who take it literally automatically fail that test; those who take it ironically and recognize a work of fine satiric fiction are those who pass the test.

It is an executive body of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), with bus franchising and highway management powers similar to Transport for London. TfWM's policies and strategy are set by the Transport Delivery Committee of the WMCA. TfWM's initial priorities are the expansion of the Metro through East Birmingham, Brierley Hill and Birmingham Airport, improvements to the M5 and M6 motorways, and new cycle routes as part of a metropolitan cycle network. There are also plans to work with central government over the future of the underused M6 Toll.  History  Before 2016, public transport services in the West Midlands were co-ordinated by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, branded as Centro. Centro's policies were set by the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority (WMITA). TfWM absorbed the functions, responsibilities, assets and staff of both of these organisations in June 2016, and the predecessor organisations were dissolved.  Governance  The WMCA's Transport Delivery Committee is a 19-member sub-committee of the Combined Authority Board. It forms part of TfWM's activities, and provides oversight of the operational delivery of transport across the West Midlands and advises the Combined Authority Board, through the Transport Portfolio Holder, on transport policy matters. The members are nominated by their respective local authorities; Birmingham City Council nominating seven members, the six other Metropolitan Boroughs nominating two members each. Each member has a single vote. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Transport Delivery Committee are appointed by the Combined Authority Board. Responsibilities Map showing Rail and Tram routes in the West Midlands County (Hednesford is also part of the Rail map) The WMCA is the Local Transport Authority and has a statutory responsibility to implement policies and strategies that co-ordinate and promote the use of public transport in the West Midlands. The WMCA's transport responsibilities include: = Strategy = *Setting and monitoring the authority's transport budget, determining the grants to be made to passenger transport companies, and determining the borrowing limits of the Combined Authority in relation to transport matters. * The allocation and prioritisation of central government grants and other forms of funding. * Long-term strategy for the West Midlands transport system, contributing to regional economic development through a network of high-volume public transport corridors. *Constructing and maintaining public transport infrastructure (bus, Metro stations, for example). *Working with public transport operators, the police, and district councils for the promotion of safe, efficient, and economic transport facilities and services. *Providing integration between public transport modes, including the provision of interchanges. *Promoting and publicising the public transport network and providing travel information. = Rail/Light Rail = * Developing a rapid transit network, including West Midlands Metro and the Coventry Very Light Rail. * Developing the rail network in partnership with Network Rail and train operating companies, and formulating policies regarding a devolved rail franchise from October 2017. * Maximising the benefits of HS2 across the West Midlands region. = Bus = * Considering and approving the creation and development of Bus Quality Contract Schemes *Increasing bus travel, and supporting the modernisation of the bus network in the region with the West Midlands Bus Alliance. *Subsidising socially necessary but commercially non-viable bus services. *Franchising bus services, if deemed necessary to improve passenger services. = Ticketing and fares = * Operating a concessionary fares scheme and implementing the government‚Äôs National Concessionary Scheme. * Integrated ticketing and developing smartcard ticketing technology within the region. * Providing an annual grant to the operator of the door-to-door Ring and Ride service for people who have difficulty using other public transport facilities. = Highways = * Management of the West Midlands Key Route Network (WM-KRN) on behalf of the metropolitan boroughs and the mayor. *Create and promote an effective freight strategy throughout the metropolitan area. Branding Network West Midlands was initially the brand used by TfWM when it assumed responsibility for public transport from Centro in 2016. In 2018, the system was rebranded with Transport for West Midlands and West Midlands Network becoming the public facing brands for transport. The system is designed to emulate the success of the Transport for London roundel, with a central diamond symbol used to denote different modes. All buses in the county will carry the same livery, irrespective of the operator running the service. The phase out of this new brand is predicted to last several years, as signage and livery is replaced on a rolling basis. File:TfWM-Brand-Family.pngThe corporate identities used by TfWM. Key projects Midland Metro Urbos 3 tram in Wolverhampton in June 2014 = West Midlands Metro = TfWM's predecessor, Centro, was responsible for the reintroduction of tram services to the West Midlands, with the development of the Midland Metro. Plans for a multi-line light rail system for the West Midlands were first drawn up in the early 1980s. The first (and so far only) line of the Midland Metro was opened in May 1999 between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The line's first extension into the streets of Birmingham city centre, from its original terminus at Birmingham Snow Hill to Grand Central opened in May 2016.Birmingham City Centre Extension Centro Further extensions of the system are planned. = West Midlands Bus = On Sunday 19 August 2018 National Express West Midlands and Diamond launched a joint timetable on services 42 West Bromwich to Tipton/Dudley and 43 West Bromwich to Bilston and 31 Mossley to Walsall 32 Lower Farm to Walsall, with National Express and Diamond buses repainted in red liveries carrying West Midlands Bus route branding. From Sunday 15 March 2020 National Express West Midlands and Diamond launched a joint timetable on services 40 West Bromwich to Wednesbury via Friar Park =High-speed rail= In August 2009, TfWM's predecessor, Centro, backed construction of a new railway in the West Midlands region for use by High Speed 2 trains, which would allow existing lines to have \\"better and more frequent local services\\". =Sprint= In July 2014, it was announced that a new BRT bus-tram service named Sprint would be introduced on the Hagley Road, from which it would connect with the western end of the Metro's Line One extension. Viewed as 'Metro's Little Sister', Sprint is intended to offer a higher level of service quality than standard bus services, and will feature some bus priority measures, like bus lanes and priority signalling to speed up service. Sprint should grow demand, and improve connectivity in areas which do not yet fully justify Metro access. Centro stated that the new City Centre- Quinton route was chosen primarily for its potential for economic growth. The route will have 16 stops. If the Quinton line is successful, there are plans to expand Sprint by running a service down the Coventry Road to the airport, connecting with the existing Sprint service in the city, thereby providing a cross-city connection which is currently not offered by bus or Metro. Ticketing TfWM is committed to the introduction of an integrated ticketing system. Network West Midlands tickets are valid across the entire network, on any operator involved in the 'n' scheme. =nBus= nBus tickets are valid on almost all operators' services in the county. Tickets can be purchased for travel within various local travel areas or across the whole of the county, and are valid for periods ranging from one day to a year.http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/TicketHome/nbus_ticket.aspx Metro travel may be added onto nBus passes. =nTrain= nTrain passes are valid on all local train services within the Network West Midlands zonal rail map (Including Hednesford, or to select out-of-county stations in the Birmingham travel-to-work metropolitan area. =Swift= Swift is the multi-modal, multi- operator smart travel card, similar to the Oyster card scheme in London. Rather than being a single card, it is a range of contactless passes and cards that share a common system and brand name. Centro began a phased rollout of the Swift card scheme in 2012, which was still ongoing in 2016 when responsibility for the scheme passed to TfWM. The system is expected to be extended across the local rail network as part of rail devolution in the West Midlands.http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/just-ticket- birmingham-commuters-oyster-style-8931699 See also *Transport in Birmingham References External links *Network West Midlands *Transport for West Midlands *West Midlands Combined Authority, the body responsible for setting TfWM policy Category:Companies owned by municipalities of England Category:History of the West Midlands (county) Category:Local government in the West Midlands (county) Category:Public transport executives in the United Kingdom Category:Transport in the West Midlands (county) Category:2016 establishments in England ","title":"Transport for West Midlands"},{"id":"1124898","text":"The Hunting Island Light is located in Hunting Island State Park on Hunting Island near Beaufort, South Carolina. Although no longer used as a functioning lighthouse, the tower is a fixture at the state park and is open to visitors. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Overview The tower is made mostly of brick with a cast-iron shell. The conical tower is tall with a second-order Fresnel light (the original light is no longer lit and the lenses are at the base of the tower for the public to view). The top third of the tower is painted black and the lower two-thirds is painted white. A fog horn was not installed. The only sound signal is a large bell. Currently, a rotating light is in place to mimic the original lamp in the lighthouse. It is turned on at dusk and rotates through the night. While not bright enough for navigation, it provides night visitors to the island the feel of an operating lighthouse. When operational, the Hunting Island Lighthouse was visible for 17 miles. Historic records from March 1890 note that the lighthouse was complete, \\"including one of the larger sized fire proof oil light houses.\\" History Construction started in 1859, but was set back as the tower was destroyed during the Civil War in 1862. Major George H. Elliot is credited with the 1860s development of what is known as the \\"segmented cast-iron\\" light house design. In the United States, two were constructed: the Hunting Island Lighthouse and subsequently Florida's Cape Canaveral Light. Hunting Island's Lighthouse was designed to be disassembled and moved if required. It consists of cast-iron sections, each weighing up to 1200 pounds which are bolted together to form the shell. the shell is lined with brick, which constitutes the main load-bearing structural element. Erection commenced in 1873, and was completed in 1875. With its 167 steps that lead to an impressive observation deck, the Hunting Island Lighthouse has handsomely built cast and wrought-iron staircase, railings and support beams that were fashioned by the Phoenix Iron Works company of Philadelphia. The Lighthouse was first located on the northern portion of Hunting Island, South Carolina, but severe beach erosion threatened the light station and its structures. By 1888 it was reported that the Atlantic Ocean‚Äôs high tide had reached within 35 feet of the keeper's house. As a result, the lighthouse, the keeper's home and two other structures were relocated a mile away in 1889 to their present locale. At the time of the 1893 Sea Islands Hurricane the Hunting Island Lighthouse functioned as a sanctuary for some passengers aboard the steamer \\"City of Savannah I\\" which had been forced onto the shoals.Hunting Island Light House State Park Historical Marker Information, August 2006 The Lighthouse continued operation until deactivation in 1933. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as reference #70000561. In 2009, celebrations were held in honor of the lighthouse's 150th anniversary. Maintenance As part of Hunting Island State Park, the tower remains open to the public. Continued remodeling of the tower is made possible by South Carolina funding and a small charge per visitor to the tower. In 2003 the lighthouse was closed for an 18-month period after rust had compromised the structural integrity of several of its cast-iron stairs. Repairs lasted for over 18 months, and included fixing cracked stairs, as well as the installation of steel brace reinforcements. The silvery-grayish braces stand in stark contrast to the black cast-iron stairs, which in turn allows visitors to distinguish between the original structural components and the more-recent modifications aimed at protecting the lighthouse's historic integrity. In 2019, engineering studies concluded that $3 million in repairs were needed to the lighthouse, particularly to repair cracks and corrosion due to weather. Part of the repairs may include the disassembly and potential relocation of the lighthouse further inland, similar to actions taken in 1889.

In ancient China, tianxia denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, tributary states, and finally ending with fringe \\"barbarians\\". The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese tianxia. In classical Chinese political thought, the \\"Son of Heaven\\" (Emperor of China) (), having received the Mandate of Heaven (), would nominally be the ruler of the entire world. Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Emperor, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Emperor. The larger concept of tianxia is closely associated with civilization and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the world view of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. Tianxia has been independently applied by other countries in the East Asian cultural sphere, including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Historical and political development The tianxia world view was not fully developed during the Shang dynasty. Only during the Zhou dynasty when Heaven took on human deity traits (or at least when references to Heaven as such enter recorded history) did the concept of tianxia become common. Terms like \\"Four Quarters\\" and \\"Ten Thousand States\\" appear in texts of the time; the term \\"Four Quarters\\" () means territory established by the royal court and governed by the Zhou kings from the capital, but with peripheral non-Han tribes on the outer borders and Han Chinese in the center. The term \\"Ten Thousand States\\" () refers to both territory and the subjects who reside therein, both Han and \\"barbarian\\". The Zhou kings received and empowered these \\"Ten Thousand States\\" by virtue of the Mandate of Heaven. This is some of the earliest evidence of the Hua-Yi distinction. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of the feudal lords developed rapidly, and several non-Han regions became powerful states themselves. As many of these feudal states had shared cultural and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the Yellow River Plain gradually expanded. The term tianxia began to appear in classical texts such as the Zuo Zhuan and Guoyu. The territory and governments of the Zhou dynasty and the Qin dynasty were unified after the conquests of Qin Shi Huang, and the concept of tianxia was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity. Qin Shi Huang's goal to \\"unify all under Heaven\\" was, in fact, representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the Han dynasty, the equivalence of tianxia with the Chinese nation evolved due to the feudal practice of conferring land and autonomy upon the aristocracy to avoid having to expend military expense in their subjugation. Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory. Unification theme applied to tianxia can be seen in Sun Tzu's The Art of War where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer: Unified China fractured into many different nations during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and with it went the practical use of the term tianxia. When Emperor Gaozu reunited China under the Tang dynasty in the 7th century, some northern tribes, after being made vassal, referred to him as the \\"Khan of Heaven\\". By the time of the Song dynasty, China's northern borders were met by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, and the Tangut-led Western Xia kingdom. After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations. The Mongols divided Chinese citizens into two types during the Yuan dynasty: those of the south, and those of the north. When the Ming dynasty expelled the Mongols and reunited China under Han rule, the concept of tianxia returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty. At the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of Neo-Confucianism and its mantras of \\"cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing tianxia\\" (a quote from the Great Learning) became widespread, producing large shifts in Confucianism. Contemporary philosopher Wang Fuzhi believed that tianxia was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning's mentioning of \\"harmonizing tianxia\\" was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism. On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the Qing dynasty by the Manchus, people previously considered \\"fringe barbarians\\", heavily influenced people's views of tianxia. Gu Yanwu, a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of tianxia. He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the tianxia of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on. The idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of tianxia by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with Earl Macartney's embassy to China in 1793. Earl Macartney hoped to deal with China as Great Britain would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to reduce restrictions on trade. The Qianlong Emperor rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods. In the early 19th century, Britain's victory over Qing China in the First Opium War forced China to sign an unequal treaty. This marked the beginning of the end for the tianxia concept. Following their defeat in the Second Opium War, China was forced to sign the Treaty of Tianjin, in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a \\"sovereign nation\\", equal to itself. This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional tianxia system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau. Because Western nations' system of international affairs was based on Westphalian sovereignty, the idea that sovereign nations deal with each other as equals, China's traditional tianxia world view slowly collapsed. After China's defeat in the First Sino- Japanese War, the Japanese terminated Korea's traditional status as a protectorate of China, and the system of feudal enfeoffment and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the tianxia concept. At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Great Britain Xue Fucheng took the traditional Hua-Yi distinction in the tianxia world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction. Non-Chinese uses of the term =Japan= References to tianxia first appear in Japanese history during the Kofun period, approximately 250 to 538 AD. At the time, Japanese rulers were respectful and submissive to the Chinese court, and Chinese immigrants (then called toraijin ) were received happily and sought after for their knowledge of the Chinese language and culture. The excavated Eda Funayama grave mound in Kumamoto contained an iron sword with engraved characters that dates to the late 5th century. The characters on the sword refer to the king of the time as the \\"Grand King who rules all under Tianxia\\" (). This discovery demonstrates that the Kofun-era Japanese (at least of that area) had begun viewing their realm to be a complete and divinely-appointed tianxia in its own right, separate from the tianxia of the older and larger Chinese empire. According to the Book of Sui, the Yamato king in 607 sent a hand-written epistle to Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty in which he called himself the \\"Son of Heaven in the Land of the Rising Sun\\" (), showing that the Japanese notion of their independent tianxia had continued to that time. With the development of Ritsury≈ç in 7th- century Japan, a Sino-centric concept of tianxia was introduced and replaced older concepts. The hallmark of Ritsury≈ç ‚Äì the concept of citizenship ‚Äì necessarily accompanied its introduction into Japan, since Neo-Confucianism said that all were \\"Equal Citizens Under Heaven\\" (). In the journals of Fujiwara no Kanezane (), an official of the Kamakura shogunate whose journals became the Gyokuy≈ç (), he describes the founding of the Shogunate by Minamoto no Yoritomo as \\"beginning tianxia\\". His usage of tianxia is entirely Ritsury≈ç in nature, and his phrase \\"beginning tianxia\\" refers to the establishment of a new nation, jurisprudence, and system of order. However, even if Yoritomo had the intention to become a monarch-level ruler, Japan's tianxia concept had not achieved the Chinese level of an Emperor who governed feudal kingdoms and was entrusted with the ordering of the world by Heaven. In the journals of Gid≈ç Sh≈´shin (), Gid≈ç records a discussion he had with Ashikaga Yoshimitsu where the Sh≈çgun repeatedly referred to his dominion as \\"tianxia\\". In the Muromachi period, people gradually began regarding the Sh≈çgun as the representative of Heaven. As the Muromachi shogunate weakened, regional warlords began fighting with each other for control of the nation. More powerful nobles, such as Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, controlled large areas and viewed their domains as tianxia. The term was used with increasing frequency as generals sought to reunify Japan, and came to be equivalent with the land of Japan itself. By the Edo period, the sh≈çgun was referred to as \\"Man of Tianxia\\" and the Shogunate as \\"Court of Tianxia\\". The widespread adoption of the tianxia concept helped influence Japan's long period of isolation before the Meiji Restoration. =Korea= Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, Goguryeo had concepts of Son of Heaven () and independent tianxia. The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the Haedong \\"East of the Sea\\" tianxia, which encompassed the historical domain of the \\"Samhan\\", another name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or the \\"Little China\\" (), emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.

Deployed on Strategic Air Command bombers, the B53, with a yield of 9 megatons, was the most powerful weapon in the U.S. nuclear arsenal after the last B41 nuclear bombs were retired in 1976. The B53 was the basis of the W-53 warhead carried by the Titan II Missile, which was decommissioned in 1987. Although not in active service for many years before 2010, fifty B53s were retained during that time as part of the \\"hedge\\" portion of the Enduring Stockpile until its complete dismantling in 2011. The last B53 was disassembled on 25 October 2011, a year ahead of schedule. With its retirement, the largest bomb currently in service in the U.S. nuclear arsenal is the B83, with a maximum yield of 1.2 megatons. The B53 was replaced in the bunker-busting role by the B61 Mod 11. History Hardtack Oak nuclear weapon test. Development of the weapon began in 1955 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, based on the earlier Mk 21 and Mk 46 weapons. In March 1958 the Strategic Air Command issued a request for a new Class C (less than five tons, megaton-range) bomb to replace the earlier Mk 41. A revised version of the Mk 46 became the TX-53 in 1959. The development TX-53 warhead was apparently never tested, although an experimental TX-46 predecessor design was detonated 28 June 1958 as Hardtack Oak, which detonated at a yield of 8.9 Megatons. The Mk 53 entered production in 1962 and was built through June 1965. About 340 bombs were built. It entered service aboard B-47 Stratojet, B-52G Stratofortress, and B-58 Hustler bomber aircraft in the mid-1960s. From 1968 it was redesignated B53. Some early versions of the bomb were dismantled beginning in 1967. About 50 bomb and 54 Titan warhead versions were in service through 1980. After the Titan II program ended, the remaining W-53s were retired in the late 1980s. The B53 was also intended to be retired in the 1980s, but 50 units remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources. In 2010 authorization was given to disassemble the 50 bombs at the Pantex plant in Texas. The process of dismantling the last remaining B53 bomb in the stockpile was completed in 2011. Specifications The B53 was long with a diameter of . It weighed , including the W53 warhead, the parachute system and the honeycomb aluminum nose cone to enable the bomb to survive laydown delivery. It had five parachutes: one pilot chute, one extractor chute, and three main chutes. Chute deployment depends on delivery mode, with the main chutes used only for laydown delivery. For free-fall delivery, the entire system was jettisoned. The W53 warhead of the B53 used oralloy (highly enriched uranium) instead of plutonium for fission , with a mix of lithium-6 deuteride fuel for fusion. The explosive lens comprised a mixture of RDX and TNT, which was not insensitive. Two variants were made: the B53-Y1, a \\"dirty\\" weapon using a U-238-encased secondary, and the B53-Y2 \\"clean\\" version with a non-fissile (lead or tungsten) secondary casing. The explosive yield for the Y1 version was declassified in 2014 and is known to be 9 Mt. Role It was intended as a bunker buster weapon, using a surface blast after laydown deployment to transmit a shock wave through the earth to collapse its target. Attacks against the Soviet deep underground leadership shelters in the Chekhov/Sharapovo area south of Moscow envisaged multiple B53/W53 exploding at ground level. It has since been supplanted in such roles by the earth- penetrating B61 Mod 11, a bomb that penetrates the surface to deliver much more of its explosive energy into the ground, and therefore needs a much smaller yield to produce the same effects. The B53 was intended to be retired in the 1980s, but 50 units remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources. The last remaining B53 bomb began the disassembly processes on Tuesday, 25 October 2011 at the Energy Department's Pantex Plant. An April 2014 GAO report notes that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is retaining canned sub- assemblies (CSAs) \\"associated with a certain warhead indicated as excess in the 2012 Production and Planning Directive are being retained in an indeterminate state pending a senior-level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids.\\" In its FY2015 budget request, the NNSA noted that the B53 component disassembly was \\"delayed\\", leading some observers to conclude they might be the warhead CSAs being retained for potential planetary defense purposes. W-53 W53 physics package The W-53 nuclear warhead of the Titan II ICBM used the same physics package as the B53, without the air drop-specific components like the parachute system and crushable structures in the nose and sides needed for lay-down delivery, reducing its mass to about . The Mark-6 re-entry vehicle containing the W53 warhead was about long, in diameter and was mounted atop a spacer which was in diameter at the missile interface (compared to the missile's core diameter of ). With a yield of 9 megatons, it was the highest yield warhead ever deployed on a US missile. About 65 W53 warheads were constructed between December 1962 and December 1963. On 19 September 1980 a fuel leak caused a Titan II to explode within its silo in Arkansas, throwing the W53 warhead some distance away. Due to the safety measures built into the weapon, it did not explode or release any radioactive material. Fifty-two active missiles were deployed in silos prior to the beginning of the retirement program in October 1982. Effects B53 on display at the Atomic Testing Museum Assuming a detonation at optimum height, a 9 megaton blast would result in a fireball with an approximate diameter. The radiated heat would be sufficient to cause lethal burns to any unprotected person within a radius (). Blast effects would be sufficient to collapse most residential and industrial structures within a radius (); within () virtually all above-ground structures would be destroyed and blast effects would inflict near 100% fatalities. Within a 500 rem (5 Sievert) dose of ionizing radiation would be received by the average person, sufficient to cause a 50% to 90% casualty rate independent of thermal or blast effects at this distance.

The Braingate technology and related Cyberkinetic‚Äôs assets are now owned by privately held Braingate, Co.BrainGate gets a new lease on life, The Boston Globe, August, 2009BrainGate intellectual property and patents The sensor, which is implanted into the brain, monitors brain activity in the patient and converts the intention of the user into computer commands. Technology Dummy unit illustrating the design of a BrainGate interface In its current form, BrainGate consists of a sensor implanted in the brain and an external decoder device, which connects to some kind of prosthetic or other external object. The sensor is in the form of a microelectrode array, formerly known as the Utah Array, which consists of 100 hair-thin electrodes that sense the electromagnetic signature of neurons firing in specific areas of the brain, for example, the area that controls arm movement. The sensor translates that activity into electrically charged signals, which are then sent to an external device and decoded in software. The decoder connects to and can use the brain signals to control an external device, such as a robotic arm, a computer cursor, or even a wheelchair. In essence, BrainGate allows a person to manipulate objects in the world using only the mind. In addition to real- time analysis of neuron patterns to relay movement, the BrainGate array is also capable of recording electrical data for later analysis. A potential use of this feature would be for a neurologist to study seizure patterns in a patient with epilepsy. BrainGate was originally developed by researchers in the Department of Neuroscience at Brown University in conjunction with bio- tech company Cyberkinetics, Inc. Cyberkinetics later spun off the device manufacturing to Blackrock Microsystems, who now manufactures the sensors and the data acquisition hardware.Blackrock Microsystems The BrainGate Company purchased the intellectual property and related technology from Cyberkinetics and continues to own the intellectual property related to BrainGate. Research and experimental results The first reported experiments involving the implantation of the microelectrode array in one human subject were carried out in 2002 by Kevin Warwick, Mark Gasson and Peter Kyberd.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A: \\"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems\\", Archives of Neurology, 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003 The procedure, which was performed at the Radcliffe Infirmary, involved the implantation of the array in the peripheral nerves of the subject in order to successfully bring about both motor and sensory functionality, i.e. bi-directional signalling.Legato, M Editor: ‚ÄùPrinciples of Gender-Specific Medicine‚Äù, Academic Press, 2017 The subsequent full clinical trial of BrainGate, was led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the Department of Veterans Affairs and ran from 2004 to 2006, involving the study of four patients with tetraplegia. The results, published in a 2006 article in the journal Nature, showed that a human with tetraplegia was able to control a cursor on a computer screen just by thinking, enabling him to open emails, and to operate devices such as a television. One participant, Matt Nagle, had a spinal cord injury, whilst another had advanced ALS. In July 2009, a second clinical trial (dubbed \\"BrainGate2\\") was initiated by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the Providence VA. In November 2011, researchers from the Stanford University Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory joined the trial as a second site. This trial is ongoing.

The battle pitted the Patriot militia from Georgia and South Carolina against a small fleet of the Royal Navy. In December 1775, the British Army was besieged in Boston. In need of provisions, a Royal Navy fleet was sent to Georgia to purchase rice and other supplies. The arrival of this fleet prompted the colonial rebels who controlled the Georgia government to arrest the British Royal Governor, James Wright, and to resist the British seizure and removal of supply ships anchored at Savannah. Some of the supply ships were burned to prevent their seizure, some were recaptured, but most were successfully taken by the British. Governor Wright escaped from his confinement and safely reached one of the fleet's ships. His departure marked the end of British control over Georgia, although it was briefly restored when Savannah was retaken by the British in 1778. Wright again ruled from 1779 to 1782, when British troops were finally withdrawn during the closing days of the war. Background In April 1775, tensions over British colonial policies in the Thirteen Colonies boiled over into war with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Following those events, Patriot colonists surrounded the city of Boston, placing it under siege, although the encirclement was incomplete: the city could be resupplied by sea. News of this action and the June Battle of Bunker Hill fanned the flames of independence throughout the colonies. Although the Province of Georgia had managed to remain relatively neutral before these events, radicals in the Georgia provincial congress came into power during the summer of 1775 and progressively stripped Georgia's Royal Governor, James Wright, of his powers.Jones, pp. 194‚Äì210 While Wright had requested a naval presence near Savannah, the colony's capital, Patriots in Charleston, South Carolina had intercepted his request and substituted for it a dispatch indicating he did not need such support.Jones, p. 180 The dispute in Georgia reached a crisis point when British men-of-war began arriving at Tybee Island in January 1776. On January 12, three ships were seen at anchor off Tybee Island; by January 18 the fleet consisted of , , , , and a number of smaller vessels. Wright's opinion, expressed to Joseph Clay and others, was that the fleet had been sent to punish the local rebels.Johnson, p. 129 In fact, these ships were the beginnings of a fleet assembled to acquire provisions in Savannah for the beleaguered British troops in Boston. In December 1775 General William Howe had ordered an expedition to purchase rice and other provisions in Georgia.Johnson, p. 128 By early February the entire fleet had assembled off Tybee Island. It was under the overall command of Captain Andrew Barclay (or Barkley) on , and included and two transports, HMS Whitby and HMS Symmetry, carrying about 200 British army regulars from the 40th Foot under the command of Major James Grant. The arrival of the first ships in January prompted the Georgia Committee of Safety to order the arrest of Wright and other provincial representatives of the Crown on January 18. Joseph Habersham, a major in the Georgia militia, placed Governor Wright under house arrest, and extracted a promise from the governor that he would not attempt to communicate with the British ships.Russell, p. 73 Wright, who continued to be harassed in spite of his confinement, feared for his life, and escaped the mansion on the night of February 11. He made his way to the plantation of a Loyalist supporter and was taken from there to Scarborough.Jones, p. 212 In the meantime, Georgia's provincial assembly had met, elected representatives to the Second Continental Congress, and begun the process of raising regiments for the Continental Army.Jones, pp. 215‚Äì217 Georgia's last Royal Governor, James Wright After Governor Wright arrived aboard Scarborough he wrote a letter to the remaining members of his council, in which he expressed frustration over getting assurances of safety and access to the desired supplies from the Patriot authorities.Russell, p. 74 Georgia had, along with the other twelve colonies, in 1774 adopted the terms of the Continental Association created by the First Continental Congress banning trade with Great Britain.Jones, p. 188 With negotiations effectively failed, Barclay ordered his fleet into action on February 29. His objective was a number of merchant vessels docked at Savannah, whose owners were desirous of moving their goods, something that became possible on March 1 when the previous constraints expired.Russell, p. 75 Battle On March 1, Scarborough, Tamar, Cherokee, and Hinchinbrook sailed up the Savannah River to Five-Fathom Hole, accompanying transports carrying two to three hundred men under Grant's command. Hinchinbrook and one of the transports then sailed up the Back River. The transport anchored opposite the port area, while Hinchinbrook, in an attempt to take a position above the town, grounded on a sandbank in the river. Gunfire from Joseph Habersham's militia cleared Hinchinbrook decks, but without suitable boats, Habersham was unable to attempt the taking of the vessel, which floated free on the next high tide.Jones, pp. 225‚Äì226 Late on the evening of March 2, Grant's men were landed on Hutchinson Island. They made their way across the island, and, at 4:00 am on March 3, took over a number of the rice boats anchored near the island. Due to their success at remaining quiet, and possibly with the collusion of the ship captains, the alarm was not raised in Savannah until 9:00 am. The arrival of the ships on March 1 prompted the Committee of Safety to issue calls for the defense of the town and the ships, which were forwarded along with a request for assistance to South Carolina's Committee of Safety the next day.Jones, pp. 221‚Äì223 When the alarm was raised, Colonel McIntosh took 300 militiamen and set up three 4-pound cannons on Yamacraw Bluff. He then sent Lieutenant Daniel Roberts and Major Raymond Demer√© II under a parley flag to one of the occupied ships; they were promptly arrested. When a second, larger, parley arrived to discuss the release of the two captives and the ships, the situation turned nasty when Captain Rogers, leader of the party, was insulted. After he fired at someone on the occupied ship, the British responded in kind, wounding one and very nearly sinking the parley group's boat. Following that boat's retreat, McIntosh opened fire with the cannons on the bluff, beginning a gunbattle that lasted for four hours.Jones, p. 227 Colonel alt=A black-and-white print of man. The portrait is half-height. The man is older, with white hair, and is wearing an 18th- century military uniform. His body is turned three-quarters left, but is looking at the viewer. The Committee of Safety, when it met to discuss the situation, decided that the supply ships should be burned, and a company of militia was assembled to accomplish this task. One supply ship, Inverness, was torched and set adrift toward the occupied vessels, causing a scramble as the British troops hurried to abandon them in the face of the arriving fire ship. During the confusion, the Patriot militia and battery were active, raking the scurrying British crews with musket fire and grape shot. Two of the occupied vessels managed to get away downstream, and two more escaped the flames by going upstream, but were forced to dock, and their crews were taken prisoner. Three ships succumbed to the flames, which burned well into the night. The action was assisted by the timely arrival of 500 South Carolina militia sent in response to the earlier appeal. Aftermath Colonel McIntosh sent a parley to Captain Barclay the next day, offering a prisoner exchange. When Barclay refused the exchange, the Committee of Safety ordered the arrest of the remaining members of Wright's council. This move proved successful; the British-held prisoners were released in exchange for promises of protection of those councillors.Jones, p. 228 In spite of the action, the British successfully sailed most of the merchant ships down the Back River, although some of the ships needed to dump a portion of their cargo in order to make it down the shallow channel.Clark, vol 4, pp. 279,494 Once they reached Tybee Island, the desired provisions, amounting to 1,600 barrels of rice, were loaded onto the two British transport ships.Clark, vol 4, p. 444 The fleet remained anchored off Tybee Island while negotiations went on over the exchange of prisoners. During this time the fleet detained several arriving vessels, which were later disposed of as prizes.Clark, vol 4, p. 327 On March 25, a band of militia from Savannah burned all the houses on the island to deny their use to Wright and the ships' officers.Jones, p. 229 Barclay weighed anchor on March 30 and sailed north, leading the convoy of merchant ships and transports.Clark, vol 4, p. 602 As the British had abandoned Boston earlier in March, he first put into Newport, Rhode Island, where the local Patriots denied him any assistance and fired at his ships using field artillery.Clark, vol 4, pp. 815,1114 He eventually rejoined the British forces at Halifax, Nova Scotia in May.Clark, vol 5, p. 118 The battle and Wright's departure marked the end of British control over Georgia until Savannah was recaptured by British forces in December 1778. Governor Wright returned, and Savannah then remained in British hands until 1782.Cashin Notes References  * * External links *Our Georgia History page describing the battle Category:1776 in the United States the Rice Boats Rice Boats Rice Boats Rice Category:History of Savannah, Georgia Category:South Carolina in the American Revolution Category:1776 in South Carolina Category:1776 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1776 in the British Empire ","title":"Battle of the Rice Boats"},{"id":"1124961","text":"Lieutenant General L√¢m Quang Thi (born 1932) was a senior military officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

Early life and source of nickname She was the daughter of a lawyer, Dr. Jorge Guillermo Borges and Leonor Acevedo Su√°rez. Leonor was given the name Norah by her older brother, Jorge Luis Borges. Of his sister, Jorge wrote: > In all of our games she was always el caudillo, I the slow, timid, > submissive one. She climbed to the top of the roof, traipsed through the > trees, and I followed along with more fear than enthusiasm. ‚ÄîJorge Luis > Borges, Norah Growing up, Norah lived in the shadow of her famous brother. It wasn't until later in life that she emerged from her brother's shadow and gained her own personal popularity. As a child, she moved with her family to Switzerland to treat the progressive blindness of her father. She studied with the classical sculptor Maurice Sarkisoff at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts of Geneva. After three years of school, Norah was told by Professor Sarkisoff to leave the ways of the academy to grow in her individual style. In Lugano she studied with Arnaldo Bossi and was close to German expressionists such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. With Bossi, Borges learned the art of woodcutting and the aesthetics of expressionism. Early career In Switzerland, Borges wrote and illustrated her first poetry book, Notas lejanas (1915). After its publication, Borges and her family hoped to return to Argentina, but their stay in Europe was extended by four years because of the First World War. During this time, Borges saw much of Europe. First, she visited Provence and was deeply so impressed by N√Æmes, that she dedicated some of her later work to her travels there. After traveling through Province, she moved to Spain, where she furthered her studies and participated in the Avant-Garde movement. In Spain, Borges first visited Barcelona, and then, in 1919, moved to Palma, Majorca. In Palma, she studied under Sven Westman and collaborated with her brother on the magazine Baleares. Next she visited Sevilla, where she became a part of the vanguard of Ultra√≠smo, published her work in magazines like Grecia (1918-1920), Ultra, Tableros y Reflector, and in 1920 she illustrated the cover of El jardin de centauro (The Garden of the Centaur), a book of poems by Adriano del Valle. In the Spanish literary magazine, Grecia, she was asked to redesign the graphic design elements of four covers and a new header for their opening page at the age of eighteen. After leaving Sevilla, she passed through Granada and then finally came to Madrid, where she studied with the painter Julio Romero de Torres. Here she befriended the poet Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez. She illustrated a number of his books and dedicated a portrait to him in her book Espa√±oles de tres mundos. In March 1921, Borges returned by boat to Buenos Aires. As a young painter, she aligned herself with the vanguard artists of the Florida group. Her work in Prisma (1921) reflects the ultraist (anti- modernist) ideas of the group, but her illustrations for magazines such as Mural, Proa (1924-1926) and Mart√≠n Fierro, and her illustrations in the first edition of the poetry book Fervor de Buenos Aires by Jorge Luis Borges (1923) reveal the influence of the Cubism that she had begun to assimilate with her French contacts in Spain. In 1923, the French surrealist magazine Manom√®tre, and, in 1924, Mart√≠n Fierro published her paintings. In the September-October 1924 issue of Martin Fierro, Borges' first collection of poems called Calle de la tarde were displayed. Also in 1924, Borges created a woodcut cover for the Mexican journal, Antena. Two years later, two of her illustrations were in the magazine Amauta. When creating for Amauta, she was working underneath Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui, who used illustration has a tool to help women artists in Latin American advertise their artwork. In 1926, she displayed 75 works (oils, woodcarvings, drawings, water-colorings, and tapestries) in the Asociacion Amigos del Arte exhibition. In 1928, she married the writer and art critic Guillermo de Torre, a student of the Ultraist movement and an expert on Avant- Garde art and literature, whom she had met in Spain when she was 19 years old. They had two children. In the Second World War, she became a vocal supporter of la Junta de la Victoria, an association of anti-fascist feminists in Argentina directed by Cora Ratto de Sadosky and Ana Rosa Schlieper de Mart√≠nez Guerrero. Also included in the group were the writer Mar√≠a Rosa Oliver, the photographer Annemarie Heinrich, the psychoanalyst Mim√≠ Langer, the artist Raquel Forner, and the poet Silvina Ocampo. Post-war career After the war, Norah spent one month with her mother Leo Acevedo in a women‚Äôs prison for uttering cries against the president of Argentina Juan Per√≥n, deepening the aversion that her brother felt for the Argentinian political party Partido Justicialista and its founder Per√≥n. After her release, Norah illustrated her brother‚Äôs book Cuaderno San Martin, as she had done with his earlier works like Luna de enfrente and Fervor de Buenos Aires, and Las invitadas (1961) and Autobiografia de Irene (1962) by Silvina Ocampo. Norah wrote as an art critic for Anales de Buenos Aires under the pseudonym Manuel Pinedo. She worked as a journalist and painter until her death in 1998, but she gave away much of her work and did not care for regular art exhibitions. Norah's arrest was odd because her paintings didn't seem to have any political context before. She wasn't very vocal about her political views even with the arrest and her association to the Sur. She even refused to make statements about her political views. Norah's protest and imprisonment were eventually represented in her art such as her painting, Recuerdos de la prisi√≥n (1948-1949). Her later paintings were considered to be more \\"female-centered\\". In 1942, a version of Platero y yo by Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez was published with illustrations and vignettes by Norah. She also worked as a graphic artist on other books by Spanish emigrants in Argentina, including Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna, Rafael Alberti and Le√≥n Felipe and illustrated the works of her brother and other Argentinian writers like Victoria Ocampo, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Norah Lange and Julio Cort√°zar. She designed the scenery of a play by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca using the techniques of oil, watercolor, engraving, woodcut, and drawings in ink and pencil. Death and burial She died in Buenos Aires in 1998, aged 97, and was buried in the family vault in the La Recoleta Cemetery.Efem√©rides Culturales Argentinas. Jorge Luis Borges: familia.

Scholarly use of the term The word subconscious represents an anglicized version of the French subconscient as coined in 1889 by the psychologist Pierre Janet (1859‚Äì1947), in his doctorate of letters thesis, De l'Automatisme Psychologique. Janet argued that underneath the layers of critical-thought functions of the conscious mind lay a powerful awareness that he called the subconscious mind.Henri F. Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) In the strict psychological sense, the adjective is defined as \\"operating or existing outside of consciousness\\". Locke and Kristof write that there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one's knowledge and prior experience is needed, which they label the subconscious.Locke, Edwin A.; Kristof, Amy L. (1996). \\"Volitional Choices in the Goal Achievement Process\\". In Gollwitzer, Peter M.; Bargh, John A. (eds.). The Psychology of Action: Linking Cognition and Motivation to Behavior. Guilford Press. p. 370. . Retrieved 2014-12-08. \\"By the 'subconscious,' we refer to that part of consciousness which is not at any given moment in focal awareness. At any given moment, very little (at most, only about seven disconnected objects) can be held in conscious, focal awareness. Everything else - all of one's prior knowledge and experiences - resides in the subconscious.\\" Compare memory.  Psychoanalysis  Sigmund Freud used the term \\"subconscious\\" in 1893Freud, Sigmund (1893). ¬´ Quelques consid√©rations pour une √©tude comparative des paralysies organiques et hyst√©riques ¬ª. Archives de neurologie, citation in Psychanalyse (fondamental de psychanalyse freudienne), sous les directions d'Alain de Mijolla & Sophie de Mijolla Mellor. Paris, P.U.F, 1996, p. 50. to describe associations and impulses that are not accessible to consciousness. He later abandoned the term in favor of unconscious, noting the following: In 1896, in Letter 52, Freud introduced the stratification of mental processes, noting that memory-traces are occasionally re-arranged in accordance with new circumstances. In this theory, he differentiated between Wahrnehmungszeichen (\\"Indication of perception\\"), Unbewusstsein (\\"the unconscious\\") and Vorbewusstsein (\\"the Preconscious\\"). From this point forward, Freud no longer used the term \\"subconscious\\" because, in his opinion, it failed to differentiate whether content and the processing occurred in the unconscious or preconscious mind. Charles Rycroft explains that the subconscious is a term \\"never used in psychoanalytic writings\\".Charles Rycroft, A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London, 2nd Ed, 1995), p. 175 Peter Gay says that the use of the term subconscious where unconscious is meant is \\"a common and telling mistake\\";Peter Gay, Freud: A Life For Our Time (London 2006), p. 453 indeed, \\"when [the term] is employed to say something 'Freudian', it is proof that the writer has not read his Freud\\".Peter Gay (ed.), A Freud Reader (London, 1995), p. 576  Analytical psychology  Carl Jung said that since there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one's knowledge and prior experience is needed. \\"New Age\\" and other modalities targeting the subconscious The idea of the subconscious as a powerful or potent agency has allowed the term to become prominent in New Age and self-help literature, in which investigating or controlling its supposed knowledge or power is seen as advantageous. In the New Age community, techniques such as autosuggestion and affirmations are believed to harness the power of the subconscious to influence a person's life and real-world outcomes, even curing sickness. Skeptical Inquirer magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.Whittaker, S. Secret attraction , The Montreal Gazette, May 12, 2007. In addition, critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self- selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias. Psychologists and psychiatrists use the term \\"unconscious\\" in traditional practices, where metaphysical and New Age literature, often use the term subconscious.In his (\\"New Thought\\") work Power of Your Subconscious Mind (1963), Joseph Murphy likens the workings of the subconscious mind to a syllogism. Murphy states (p. 43), \\"whatever major premise your conscious mind assumes to be true determines the conclusion your subconscious mind comes to in regard to any particular question or problem in your mind.\\" This means that if your major premise is true, then the conclusion that follows your premise must be true also. He shares the following formula. \\"Every virtue is laudable; Kindess is a virtue; Therefore, kindness is laudable.\\" Murphy argues that because your subconscious mind operates like a syllogism one can reap great benefits by utilizing a powerful and positive major premise. He also warns that the opposite could hold true: if one uses a negative, self-defeating major premise, one could reap horrible consequences. It should not, however, be inferred that the concept of the unconscious and the New Age concept of the subconscious are precisely equivalent, even though they both warrant consideration of mental processes of the brain. Psychologists and psychiatrists take a much more limited view of the capabilities of the unconscious than are represented by New Age depiction of the subconscious. There are a number of methods in use in the contemporary New Age and paranormal communities that affect the latter: * Affirmations * Autosuggestion * Binaural beats * Hypnosis * Subliminal message See also * Consciousness * Collective unconscious * History of hypnosis * Non-rapid eye movement sleep * Preconscious * Rapid eye movement sleep * Slow-wave sleep * Subconscious sex * Subliminal stimuli * Unconscious mind ;Transdisciplinary topics * List of thought processes * Philosophy of mind * The Subconscious For Academic Success Notes and references External links * The Subconscious For Academic Success * A Reader's Guide To Pierre Janet: A Neglected Intellectual Heritage * Who‚Äôs Minding the Mind? * Category:Consciousness studies Category:Hypnosis zh:ÊΩõÊÑèË≠ò ","title":"Subconscious"},{"id":"1125002","text":"USS Blackfin (SS-322), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the blackfin, a food fish of the Great Lakes. Blackfin (SS-322) was launched 12 March 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn., sponsored by Mrs. Phyllis Irwin Lockwood, wife of Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood; and commissioned 4 July 1944, Lieutenant Commander George Hays Laird, Jr., in command. Blackfin arrived at Pearl Harbor 11 September 1944. During her war operations (30 September 1944 ‚Äì 5 September 1945) she completed five war patrols. Her operating areas included the South China and the Yellow Seas. Blackfin sank the Japanese destroyer Shigure, 24 January 1945, in ., and a cargo ship for a total of 4325 tons. The termination of hostilities occurred while Blackfin was on her fifth war patrol. After occupying a lifeguard station and destroying 61 floating mines, she retired to Guam, arriving in Apra Harbor 5 September 1945. After receiving voyage repairs and fuel she proceeded to San Diego where she joined Submarine Squadron 1. Through July 1948 Blackfin continued on active duty in the Pacific. The majority of her operations were conducted near the Hawaiian and Mariana Islands. In June and July 1946 she participated in \\"Operation Iceberg\\" which took her across the Arctic Circle. She reported to Mare Island for inactivation in July 1948 and was placed out of commission in reserve there 19 November 1948. In November 1950 Blackfin began conversion to a Guppy submarine and was recommissioned 15 May 1951. She operated with Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, based at San Diego until 8 March 1954 and thereafter at Pearl Harbor. During this time she completed two tours in the Far East (December 1951 ‚Äì June 1952 and January‚ÄìJune 1955); conducted local and training operations; and made several simulated war patrols. During her career, Blackfin was used in two movies: 1963s Move Over, Darling with Doris Day, James Garner, and Polly Bergen, and 1968s Ice Station Zebra with Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine, and Patrick McGoohan. Blackfin was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1972. She was used as a target and sunk by torpedo in the \\"SubSinkEx Project Thurber\\" project off San Diego, California on 13 May 1973. Some sources http://usssabalo.org/History_Sabalo.html indicate that the sinking was by deliberate partial flooding to acquire acoustic data on submarine implosions and that no torpedoes were used. Blackfin received three battle stars for her World War II service.

The Act provided the framework for the creation of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England and Wales, and also addressed public rights of way and access to open land. The Act was passed in 1949 with all- party support, as part of the reconstruction of the UK by the Labour government after World War II. The Act followed reports by: *a Government committee chaired by Christopher Addison (later Viscount Addison) in 1931, *John Dower, secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks, to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945, and *a Government committee chaired by Sir Arthur Hobhouse in 1947, which proposed 12 national parks. The first 10 British national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural upland. An eleventh 'national park' in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads was set up by a special Act of Parliament, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act, in 1988 (strictly speaking, this is not a national park, but the differences are sufficiently small that this entity is always regarded as being \\"equivalent to\\" a national park). The New Forest was designated a national park on 1 March 2005.

Its significance to Te Hap≈´ o NgƒÅti Wheke as a site for food gathering was acknowledged with the installation in 2019 of a 9 metre tall pou whenua. This pillar was carved by Caine Tauwhare and named Te Hamo o T≈´ Te RakiwhƒÅnoa: a hamo was a tool for planting kumara. =Quarantine and leper colony= Europeans briefly farmed the island in 1851, before it was turned into a quarantine station in 1875, a hospital during the influenza epidemic of 1907, and a small leper colony from 1906 to 1925. During its time as a leper colony, fourteen men were sent there, and two died there. Ivon Skelton arrived in 1919. Born in Apia, Samoa, he was visiting family on the West Coast in 1918 when he was diagnosed with leprosy. He and his cousin were put into isolation in Cobden, but while his cousin was released, Skelton was sent to Quail Island. He died there on 22 October 1923≈åtamahua/Quail Island Recreation Reserve (from the Department of Conservation website) at age 24, and was buried on the island. A small fence was put up around the grave in 1931. An attempt was made in 2015 to exhume the body, to save it from threatening erosion and to study the DNA of the disease as little was known about Pacific strains. However, two days of excavations found only a ceramic pot and glass bowl, perhaps used to hold flowers, and a large hole that had been filled with rocks, perhaps to protect the site from erosion. Sam Te Iringa was brought to the island in late 1920 from Kirikau PƒÅ, where only his niece had been willing to care for him. He found a run-down colony without a nurse. Due to the poor conditions he tried to organise a strike, but as the patients did no work, the strike was not effective. He died in January 1922 on a Friday afternoon, and was buried the next day by Lyttelton priest Father Patrick Cooney. The location of his grave is unknown. Another patient George Phillips walked off the island at low tide in 1925, crossing the mud flats to Charteris Bay where he posed as a clergyman. From there he took a taxi to Christchurch, changed his surname to Freeman, and spent his last years in a boardinghouse in Petone. He died there in 1931. Other leprosy patients included Jim Lord, Jim Kokiri, Pakira Matawai, Ah Pat, Ipirini Apa Apa, and Ah Yip. Will Vallance, from Queensland, had been diagnosed at age 30 and spent 19 years on the island. He was among the last eight patients who were moved off the island in 1925 to Makogai. In 1931 the patients' huts were pulled down, other buildings removed, and furniture sold. Animals were also quarantined on the island, separately from the leprosy patients. These were huskies, mules and ponies going to Antarctica on Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton's expeditions. Subantarctic explorations that used Quail Island were the Discovery Expedition (1901‚Äì04), Nimrod Expedition (1907‚Äì09), Terra Nova Expedition (1910‚Äì13), and the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (1928‚Äì30). Replicas of dog kennels (once used for training of the dogs used in Antarctic expeditions of the early 20th century) and a replica leprosy patient's hut were built by students of Cathedral College, with the quarantine barracks also restored and moved to the beach front. Ecological restoration The island was declared a recreation reserve in 1975, but was also farmed (potatoes) until the early 1980s by David Helliwell who also acted as the island's caretaker. The ≈åtamahua/Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust and the Department of Conservation are currently working to remove pests and re-vegetate the island, with the aim of eventually re-introducing native wildlife. The Trust aims to restore of native forest to the island to provide a refuge for locally extinct, uncommon and threatened bird and invertebrate species of the Banks Peninsula region. Community volunteers have been transformed large areas of the island from dry and desolate pest-ridden areas to a safe haven for indigenous species. The project is unique in the way it balances the recreational use and historical features of Quail Island while re-establishing the native ecosystems, both flora and fauna. Penguin nesting boxes have also been established on the island to provide a safe nesting site for the white- flippered penguin, an endangered Banks Peninsula native. The Trust organises fortnightly work parties on the island to undertake animal and weed pest control. An annual planting is undertaken each spring. Since 1997, volunteers have eradicated rabbits, cats, hedgehogs, and ship rats from the island. A trap network on the mainland and the stepping-stone island to ≈åtamahua aim to prevent reinvasion, but the island's inter-tidal link to the mainland make this likely, particularly by rodents. The Trust's volunteers have planted more than 95,000 native trees and shrubs, established a nursery to propagate silver tussock, and eradicated all predators except mice. As a result, birds, invertebrates and rare plants have been reintroduced to the island. This includes bellbirds and kereru as well as Lepidium aegrum (Banks Peninsula scurvy grass), a \\"nationally critical\\" plant. Invertebrates translocated include a Banks Peninisula ground beetle Megadromus guerinii, Banks Peninsula tree weta Hemideina ricta, and the leaf-vein slug Pseudaneitea maculata.  Visitors  About 16,000 people visit the island every year. Quail Island is the only substantial island in the Canterbury area accessible to the public. This island has a number of safe swimming beaches, as well as same-day facilities (toilets, day shelter). A ferry service is available to the island, and private watercraft may also access the island. The ≈åtamahua/Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust encourages and facilitates educational activities and relevant research on the natural features and cultural history of the island. Many schools and groups now visit the island to combine outdoor activities with their studies of the natural environment.

The 2011 census recorded the population of the parish, including Strixton, as 3,491. Wollaston is from above sea level on hills east of the Nene valley. The soil is clay over subsoil and is on the old Wellingborough to London road. Summer Leys Local Nature reserve is nearby. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as Wilavestone. In a document written in 1190 it is spelt Wullaueston. The name comes from Old English and is believed to mean the farmstead or village of a man named Wulfaf. History In common with the rest of Northamptonshire, Wollaston is noted for its shoe industry. The Solovair brand of British-made boots and footwear is produced by NPS Shoes Ltd. NPS has been in operation in the village since 1881 and now has a factory shop. Until 2003, Dr. Martens boots were made in Wollaston. In 2007, manufacture of the \\"Made in England\\" line of Dr. Martens footwear was resumed in the Cobbs Lane Factory in Wollaston. Wollaston also has the head office of an international chemical company, founded by the Quaker Ernest Bader (1890‚Äì1982), which is now a common ownership factory, the Scott Bader Commonwealth, making advanced resins and composite materials. Steeple of St Mary's parish church Wollaston has both a primary and a secondary school (Wollaston School), local shops, post office, library and public houses. The village has four churches: Church of England, Baptist, Methodist and a Salvation Army Citadel. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the benefice of St Mary's parish church was held by Delapr√© Abbey in Northampton. The oldest parts of the building are 13th-century. It is a Grade II* listed building. At the north end of the High Street there is a village museum. History Wollaston was developed as a linear settlement starting at what is now Cobbs Lane moving past Bell End, Rotten Row, St Michaels' Lane and down towards Strixton. =Romano-British= Settlement and activity in the area are known to date from at least Roman times. Remains of an Romano-British vineyard are known in Wollaston, and are some of the first such sites confirmed in Britain. The course of a Roman road passes roughly east‚Äìwest just south of the modern part of Wollaston. The course of another Roman road passes north‚Äìsouth to the east. =Anglo-Saxon= There is strong evidence of an Anglo-Saxon settlement and activity, including the discovery of the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer helmet in a warrior's grave dating from about AD 700. =High Middle Ages= The oldest visible part of Wollaston is known as Beacon Hill, an ancient castle earthwork or burial mound which once belonged to Bury Manor. The mound was once surrounded by a great ditch which dates back to the 12th century. A wall plaque records that this was the site of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. In 1260 William de Bray secured a charter from Henry III to hold an annual Michaelmas fair and a weekly market to be held on a Tuesday. In 1282 Margery de Wolaston was elected Abbess of Delapr√© Abbey in Northampton. She died circa 1296. =18th Century= In 1788 Wollaston's open fields and common lands were enclosed by Act of Parliament. At the time David Hennell, a lace dealer from Wollaston wrote \\"I lament that this field is now agoing to be enclosed. Some that have large quantities of land are set upon it, and pay no regard to the many little ones that may be injured, and I fear many ruined.\\" The enclosure reduced the number of landowners in the village from 108 to just 18. =19th Century= Wollaston Methodist Chapel Wollaston's first school opened in 1842 and was located in a building next to what is now the Indian restaurant (formerly The Cuckoo pub), opposite Bell End. The school was private and was run by a curate, the Reverend JJ Scott, from his own funds. The school did not come under government control until 1873. The school has moved several times, finally being established on College Street in a building dating from May 1894. In this period significant industry came to Wollaston in the form of shoe-making. In 1885 one of the shoe factories was established as a workers' co-operative of local cobblers, which survived until the 21st century as Northamptonshire Productive Society and remains a shoe factory as NPS (Shoes) Ltd, making shoes under the George Cox, Tredair, Solovair and NPS brands among others. The Wollaston Vulcanising Co-Operative was another local business. =20th Century= Dr Martens Offices Shoe-making, and the mechanisation of this work, continued in the early 20th century with a number of nationally known shoe-making companies establishing themselves in Wollaston and surrounding area. In 1940 Scott Bader moved manufacturing to Wollaston from London; the move became permanent and the company is now an integral part of the local community. The company founders, Ernest Bader and Dora Scott, established the Scott Bader Commonwealth in the 1950s, gifting the whole company to its employees for all time. The company now functions as a co- operative with profits divided between investment in the company, bonus for employees and charitable donations. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s LSM Engineering, a manufacturer of model steam engines, was based in Wollaston.

It is a white flake or powdered solid. Sebaceus is Latin for tallow candle, sebum is Latin for tallow, and refers to its use in the manufacture of candles. Sebacic acid is a derivative of castor oil. In the industrial setting, sebacic acid and its homologues such as azelaic acid can be used as a monomer for nylon 610, plasticizers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, cosmetics, candles, etc. Production Sebacic acid is produced from castor oil by cleavage of ricinoleic acid, which is obtained from castor oil. Octanol is a byproduct. It can also be obtained from decalin via the tertiary hydroperoxide, which gives cyclodecenone, a precursor to sebacic acid. Potential medical significance Sebum is a secretion by skin sebaceous glands. It is a waxy set of lipids composed of triglycerides (‚âà41%), wax esters (‚âà26%), squalene (‚âà12%), and free fatty acids (‚âà16%). Included in the free fatty acid secretions in sebum are polyunsaturated fatty acids of which sebacic acid is a major component. Sebacic acid is also found in other lipids that coat the skin surface. Human neutrophils can convert sebacic acid to its 5-oxo analog, i.e.5-oxo-6E,8Z-octadecaenoic acid (5-oxo-ODE). 5-Oxo-ODE is a structural analog of 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid and like this oxo- eicosatetraenoic acid is an exceptionally potent activator of eosinophils, monocytes, and other pro-inflammatory cells from humans and other species. This action is mediated by the OXER1 receptor on these cells. It is suggested that sebacic acid is converted to its 5-oxo analog during, and thereby stimulates pro-inflammatory cells to contribute to the worsening of, various inflammatory skin conditions.

Transport for Greater Manchester Committee (TfGMC) TfGM inherited the responsibilities of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive established in 1974. On 1 April 2011, the GMPTE became Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a new regional transport body for Greater Manchester that forms part of the new Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA). As a result, GMITA was abolished, replaced by the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee (TfGMC) which ultimately reports to the Combined Authority. TfGMC and its subcommittees are made up of a nominated pool of 33 councillors from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester who manage TfGM and create transport policy in Greater Manchester. Although it differs in certain structural forms, on the day of its inauguration TfGM became the second most powerful and influential transport organisation in England after Transport for London because it unites previously splintered governance over transport policy in the boroughs under one body. It elects its own Chair and Vice-Chair and assumes the functions previously performed by GMITA as well as the newly devolved transport powers and responsibilities from Government and the 10 Metropolitan Councils which make up the area. The 33 councillors have voting rights on most transport issues despite not being members of the GMCA: major decisions still require approval by the GMCA, but the functions that are referred (but not delegated) to the TfGMC include making recommendations in relation to: *The budget and transport levy *Borrowing limit *Major and strategic transport policies *The local transport plan *Operation of Greater Manchester Transport Fund and approval of new schemes *Appointment of Director General/Chief Executive of TfGM Corporate identity A TfGM bus stop in 2011 following rebranding TfGM uses a corporate identity designed in-house.

The school is now one of several schools operated under the High Tech High charter schools umbrella organization. History Beginning in 1998, forty public and corporate partners, led by current board chair Gary Jacobs, began meeting to discuss the current state of education in San Diego. Faced with a shortage of workers for the locally strong high tech and biotech industries, the group wondered why the local school system was not better able to produce more qualified workers. Having given money to the school district in the past and questioning the return on that investment, these local entrepreneurs decided to open a new high school and christened it High Tech High. Soon thereafter, longtime educator Larry Rosenstock was asked to present to this group about different possible governance structures for the school. He then became the founding principal of the school, and is now the C.E.O. of the network of schools. The school was founded in September 2000 with 200 students and currently educates 527 students. High Tech High occupies a building on the former Navy Training Center in the Point Loma area, which is now known as Liberty Station. The school is organized that on a project-based learning model (most learning comes from multi-subject projects, rather than the more traditional approach, where teachers talk and students listen), real- world connection, personalization, and having a common intellectual mission (no ability grouping). Together with several of the other HTH schools, the school is called the \\"High Tech High Village\\", which most students simply call \\"The Village\\". Methodology At the High Tech High schools, the method of teaching is based on \\"project-based learning\\", in which students are given a project which involves working independently or in groups and doing research to complete it. Some classes have projects where grades from different subjects will be all part of the same project. Projects the students have worked on include designing a human-powered submarine, genetic manipulation, designing a water treatment plant, writing a book on the Harlem Renaissance, creating a sitcom and building a robot out of old computer parts. All students complete internships in the junior year. These internships are currently a three-week immersion experience working full-time at various places such as website companies, biotech firms, non profits, and other schools. Financing The schools are primarily publicly funded. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed a one-time gift of $1000 per student when the school opened, and has pledged millions of dollars to build more schools following the model over the next four years. Some are already in operation. Financial support to develop the original HTH also came from Gary Jacobs, son of Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs. Jacobs also donated almost 9 million dollars in building space for three of the schools in the village. FIRST Robotics (The Holy Cows) The school is home to one of thirty FIRST Robotics Competition teams in San Diego County. The school's team, named The Holy Cows,http://www.team1538.com is nationally recognized.

They are 2007-2016 reigning Frontier League champions. During the summer and fall seasons, the team practices long distance training for the cross country season, and in the winter and spring months they shift focus to track & field. The team qualified for the CIF State Cross Country Meet in 2014 and 2016. =Water polo= Although the school has minimal funding for athletics, a water polo team was started in 2009.

History The band debuted with three scattered gigs (all in Athens, Georgia) in 1984. The group played mostly cover tunes, though a few unreleased originals also made it into the mix. The first gig took place on Valentine's Day, 1984, and featured Bryan Cook (vocals and piano, a member of Athens bands Oh-OK and Time Toy), and R.E.M. members Bill Berry (drums), Peter Buck (guitar) and Mike Mills (bass). The follow-up gig took place two weeks later; added to the line-up was R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe on vocals and drums, and Warren Zevon on vocals. Zevon performed his hit \\"Werewolves of London\\", as well several other songs that were, at that point, unrecorded (including \\"Boom Boom Mancini\\" and \\"Trouble Waiting To Happen\\"). The final 1984 gig took place in June, and featured the Cook/Berry/Buck/Mills line-up. The group entered the studio as a quintet that summer, with the line-up of Berry/Buck/Cook/Mills/Zevon. They recorded two songs for release as a single, which were eventually released in 1986. The A-Side, \\"Gonna Have a Good Time Tonight\\", was a cover of an Easybeats tune; the B-side, \\"Narrator,\\" was a Bill Berry composition that R.E.M. had played live, but never recorded. (The song's composition was credited to Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe.) After a period of inactivity, Hindu Love Gods played one 1986 gig in Athens as a benefit for the family of the recently deceased musician D. Boon of Los Angeles band The Minutemen who had once toured with R.E.M. The personnel for this performance was Berry, Buck, Cook, Mills and Stipe. Buck, Mills and Berry later joined Zevon as his back-up band while recording Zevon's solo album Sentimental Hygiene (1987). During an all-night (and supposedly drunken) session in the midst of recording Zevon's album, the four recorded ten cover songs, mostly blues standards. Although originally not intended for publication, these recordings were finally released by Giant Records on the album Hindu Love Gods (1990), with the artist credit going to Hindu Love Gods. The song that received the most attention was a rock version of Prince's 1985 hit \\"Raspberry Beret\\", which reached No. 23 on the Modern Rock charts. During a concert at The Shadow in Kansas City in December 1990, Zevon commented that the album was \\"selling by the shitload,\\" whereupon one of his backing band informed him that it was \\"selling like shit.\\" The album peaked at No. 168 on Billboard's Top Album Charts.

A leading Republican and non-interventionist; McCormick opposed the increase in federal power brought about by the New Deal and later opposed American entry into World War II. His legacy includes what is now the McCormick Foundation philanthropic organization. Early life and international education McCormick was born July 30, 1880, in Chicago to Robert Sanderson McCormick (1849‚Äì1919) and his wife Katherine Van Etta Medill McCormick (1853‚Äì1932). His wealthy and distinguished family is explained in detail in a separate section below. Members quickly nicknamed him \\"Bertie\\" because so many relatives shared the name, including his late paternal great-grandfather Robert McCormick. His maternal grandfather was Tribune editor and former Chicago mayor Joseph Medill, on whose estate McCormick would live for much of his adult life. On his father's side, his great-uncle was inventor and businessman Cyrus McCormick. His elder brother Joseph Medill McCormick (known as \\"Medill McCormick\\") was slated to take over the family newspaper business, but was more interested in running for political office, and became a member of the United State House of Representatives (1917‚Äì1919) and then the U.S. Senate before losing his bid for a second term and committing suicide in Washington, D.C. in 1925. Meanwhile, from 1889 through 1893, Bertie lived a lonely childhood with his parents in London. His father Robert Sanderson McCormick was Second Secretary of the American Legation in London, serving from 1889 to 1892 under Robert Todd Lincoln. Later, his father served as his nation's ambassador to Austria-Hungary (1901‚Äì1902) and Imperial Russia (1902‚Äì1905), and replaced Horace Porter as ambassador to France in 1905. While in London, Bertie attended Ludgrove School. Sent back to the United States, Bertie attended Groton School, as had his brother. In 1899, the year of his maternal grandfather Joseph Medill's death, McCormick matriculated at Yale College, where he was elected to the prestigious secret society Scroll and Key and graduated in 1903 (three years after his brother). Robert McCormick then attended the Northwestern University School of Law and after graduation became a clerk in a Chicago law firm. Career Robert McCormick was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1907. The following year, he co-founded the law firm that became Kirkland & Ellis, which represented the Tribune Company. However, his elder brother, Medill McCormick, had become depressed after taking over and expanding the family newspaper business, so, in 1908, on the advice of psychoanalyst Carl Jung, he gave up that job and became increasingly involved in the family publishing business. Despite that business involvement, a scandal that ultimately led to his marriage (see below), and his military service (which led to him becoming known as \\"the Colonel\\"); McCormick continued as a law firm partner until 1920. In 1910, Robert McCormick took control of the Chicago Tribune and, in 1914, became editor and publisher with his cousin, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson, who was the son of a Tribune editor who had wed Joseph Medill's daughter. In 1919, Patterson, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois, moved to New York City and founded the tabloid New York Daily News. However he and McCormick, while often disagreeing, jointly held both positions at the Chicago Tribune until 1926, when McCormick assumed both roles at the Tribune, and Patterson concentrated on the New York Daily News. In 1904 a Republican ward leader persuaded McCormick to run for alderman. Elected, he served two years on the Chicago City Council. In 1905, at the age of 25, he was elected to a five-year term as president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Sanitary District, which operated the city's vast drainage and sewage disposal system. In 1907 McCormick was appointed to the Chicago Permanent Charter Commission and the Chicago Plan Commission. However, his political career ended abruptly when he took control of the Tribune. McCormick went to Europe as a war correspondent for the Tribune in February 1915, early in World War I. He interviewed Tsar Nicholas, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill. McCormick also visited (and was under fire on) both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Using connections his father had made while ambassador to Russia, McCormick attended formal dinners with Grand Duke Nicholas and Grand Duke Peter. During this trip, McCormick collected fragments of the cathedral at Ypres and the city hall of Arras. Reputedly, these pieces were the first of the collection of stones that were later embedded in the facade of the Tribune Tower. However, they are not actually on display.Annabel Wharton, \\"The Tribune Tower: Spolia as Despoliation\\", in Reuse Value: Spolia and Appropriation in Art and Architecture, from Constantine to Sherrie Levine, ed. Richard Brilliant and Dale Kinney (Ashgate, 2011), 179-197 =Military service= Returning to the United States in early 1915, McCormick joined the Illinois National Guard on June 21, 1916. His family background, education and expert horsemanship led to his being commissioned as a major in its 1st Cavalry Regiment. Two days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had called the Illinois National Guard into federal service, along with those of several other states, to patrol the Mexican border during General John Joseph Pershing's Punitive Expedition. McCormick accompanied his regiment to the Mexican border. Soon after the United States entered the war, the entire Illinois National Guard was mobilized for federal service in Europe. McCormick thus became part of the U.S. Army on June 13, 1917, and was sent to France as an intelligence officer on the staff of General Pershing. Seeking more active service, he was assigned to an artillery school. By June 17, 1918, McCormick became a lieutenant colonel, and by September 5, 1918, was promoted to a full colonel in the field artillery. He took part in the capture of Cantigny (hence his later naming his farm estate near Wheaton, Illinois), and in the battles of Soissons, Saint- Mihiel, and the second phase of the Argonne. McCormick served in the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, with the 1st Infantry Division. His service ended on December 31, 1918, though he remained a part of the Officers Reserve Corps from October 8, 1919, to September 30, 1929. Cited for prompt action in battle, he received the Distinguished Service Medal, and was later always referred to as \\"Colonel McCormick.\\" =Crusading publisher= McCormick returned from the war and took control of the Tribune in the 1920s. Given the lack of schools of journalism in the midwestern United States at the time, McCormick and Patterson sponsored a school named for their grandfather, the Joseph Medill School of Journalism. It was announced by Walter Dill Scott in November 1920, and began classes in 1921. As publisher of the Tribune, McCormick was involved in a number of legal disputes regarding freedom of the press that were handled by McCormick's longtime lawyer Weymouth Kirkland. The most famous of these cases is Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), a case championed by McCormick in his role as chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association's Committee on Free Speech. Tribune Tower A conservative Republican, McCormick was an opponent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and compared the New Deal to Communism. For a period in 1935, he protested Rhode Island's Democratic judiciary by displaying a 47 star flag outside the Tribune building, with the 13th star (representing Rhode Island) removed; he relented after he was advised that alteration of the American flag was unlawful. He was also an America First non-interventionist who strongly opposed entering World War II \\"to rescue the British Empire\\". He famously published the \\"Victory Program,\\" a military plan that FDR had ordered in the summer of 1941 to prepare the United States for possible entry into World War II. It had been leaked to him by US Senator Burton K. Wheeler. The publication was on December 4, 1941, only three days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy it stirred died off quickly after the December 7 attack. In June 1942, the Tribune published an article that indicated that the Americans had broken Japanese codes, the 1942 Chicago Tribune incident. As a publisher he was very innovative. McCormick was a 25 percent owner of the Tribune's 50,000 watt radio station, which was purchased in 1924; he named it WGN, the initials of the Tribune's motto, the \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\". He also established the town of Baie-Comeau, Quebec in 1936 and constructed a paper mill and a hydroelectric power plant there named McCormick Dam to generate electricity for the mill. McCormick carried on crusades against various local, state, and national politicians, gangsters and racketeers, labor unions, prohibition and prohibitionists, Wall Street, the East and Easterners, Democrats, the New Deal and the Fair Deal, liberal Republicans, the League of Nations, the World Court, the United Nations, British imperialism, socialism, and communism. Besides Roosevelt, his chief targets included Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson and Illinois Governor Len Small. Some of McCormick's personal crusades were seen as quixotic (such as his attempts to reform spelling of the English language) and were parodied in political cartoons in rival Frank Knox's Chicago Daily News. Knox's political cartoonists, including Cecil Jensen, derided McCormick as \\"Colonel McCosmic\\", a \\"pompous, paunchy, didactic individual with a bristling mustache and superlative ego.\\" In 1943 he told an audience he helped plan a defence against an invasion from Canada at the end of World War I. In June 1947, he gave a 100-year birthday party for the Tribune that included a fireworks show called \\"the most colossal show since the Chicago fire.\\" Other publications noted that everything about the celebration was called \\"the world's greatest\\". Time magazine editorialized that \\"the Tribune has been made into a worldwide symbol of reaction, isolation, and prejudice by a man capable of real hate.\\" McCormick had purchased the Washington Times-Herald newspaper following the 1948 death of Eleanor Medill \\"Cissy\\" Patterson, his first cousin. The paper was an \\"isolationist and archconservative\\" publication known for sensationalism. McCormick appointed his niece, then known as Ruth \\"Bazy\\" McCormick Miller as the publisher of the paper in 1949. He wanted Bazy to use the paper to create \\"an outpost of American principles\\". When the two came to a parting of the ways over her relationship with one of the paper's editors, Garvin Tankersley, as well as editorial control over the paper, he ordered her to choose between Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. Bazy later said, \\"I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me ... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [McCormick] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. =Family life and scandal= McCormick married twice, but had no children from either marriage. His first wife was Amy Irwin, the former wife of his father's first cousin, Edward Shields Adams. Starting in the summer of 1904, McCormick had spent much time at the homes of Adams in downtown Chicago and Lake Forest, Illinois. Amanda McCormick (1822‚Äì1891), youngest daughter of family patriarch Robert McCormick, had married fellow Virginian Hugh Adams (1820‚Äì1880) before moving to Chicago to start the McCormick & Adams grain trading business. Their son, Edward Shields Adams, born in 1859, had married the much younger Amie de Houle \\"Amy\\" Irwin on April 15, 1895. She was born in 1872, the daughter of decorated soldier Bernard J. D. Irwin. Starting in November 1913, a bitter family dispute developed. Amy Irwin Adams filed for divorce, claiming Adams was alcoholic, and the suit was granted on March 6, 1914, without her husband appearing in court. In September 1914, Adams filed another lawsuit. He sued McCormick for trespass and asked for the divorce case to be heard again. The opposition press made the most out of the scandals. Adams presented McCormick with a bill for eight years of lodging, and claimed McCormick had \\"wickedly and maliciously debauched and carnally knew the said Amy Irwin Adams\\" while his guest. Other allegations included that McCormick had a former chauffeur arrested and interrogated by a private detective. McCormick then counterclaimed that he had made loans to Adams which had to be repaid. The case was heard by Federal Court Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November. It was hinted that McCormick had promised to forgive the loans if Adams dropped his suit to reopen the divorce. Landis ruled in favor of McCormick in February 1915. Following the settlement, on March 10, 1915, McCormick married Amy Irwin Adams, after waiting the year after the original divorce decree as was required by law at the time. The wedding occurred in London, in the registry office of St George's, Hanover Square, with only two witnesses present. The Tribune did not mention the wedding, nor any of the previous lawsuits. After Amy died in 1939, McCormick became a near social recluse. On December 21, 1944, he married Mrs. Maryland Mathison Hooper in the apartment of his cousin Chauncey McCormick. She was 47 and he was 64 at the time. She lived until July 21, 1985. In his later years and until his death, McCormick lived at the estate named Cantigny, in Wheaton, Illinois. The childless McCormick for a time mentored his niece, Ruth \\"Bazy\\" McCormick Miller (later Tankersley) to be the heir to his publishing empire. He was said to have \\"doted\\" on Bazy. When McCormick appointed her as the publisher of the Washington Times-Herald in 1949, she was 28 years old and was given the title of Vice-President. When Bazy divorced her husband in 1951, ultimately to elope with an editor at the paper, Garvin \\"Tank\\" Tankersley, the two came to a parting of the ways. McCormick considered Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because \\"Tank\\" was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. McCormick also disapproved of her divorce in general, which Bazy viewed as hypocritical, given McCormick's own complicated personal life. When McCormick delivered the ultimatum that she choose between Garvin Tankersley and the paper, she resigned from the Times-Herald. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death. Personality McCormick was regarded as a \\"remote, coldly aloof, ruthless aristocrat, living in lonely magnificence, disdaining the common people ... an exceptional man, a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to, but at the same time had to be feared; an eccentric, misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing, cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him.\\" McCormick was described by one opponent as \\"the greatest mind of the fourteenth century\\"Current Biography 1941, p. 545. and by the American labor historian Art Preis as a \\"fascist-minded multi-millionaire\\".\\"Police- State Liberals: A case of \\"midsummer madness\\"?\\", Art Preis, Fall 1954. Retrieved April 27, 2008. On line here. In his memoirs, publisher Henry Regnery described his meeting with McCormick and William Henry Chamberlin: > The Colonel received us in his rather feudal office, high above Michigan > Avenue at the top of his Gothic tower. He was a tall, erect, distinguished- > looking man, who, with his white hair, blue eyes, ruddy complexion, white > mustache, and in his manner and dress, conveyed the impression that he might > have come from the English landed aristocracy.

Death and legacy In failing health since an attack of pneumonia, following a trip to Europe in April 1953;\\"Publisher Died in Sleep\\", The New York Times, April 2, 1955. Retrieved September 13, 2020. McCormick nonetheless remained active in his work until the month before he died, on April 1, 1955. He was buried on his farm, in his war uniform. His second wife survived him by three decades.Find A Grave Upon his death, the childless McCormick left an estate estimated at $55 million, including stock in the Chicago Tribune Company. His will established a trust devoted to charitable purposes, including maintenance of his former home, which became Cantigny Park and includes a museum.http://www.cantigny.org/about-us/Pages/McCormick%20Foundation.aspx The Northwestern University School of Law building that opened in 1962 was named McCormick Hall following a donation from the foundation. After a donation to renovate the Technological Institute building at Northwestern University in 1989, the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science was also named for him. McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum was funded by the foundation Within days of McCormick's death, Richard J. Daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate Chicago, this time aligned with the Democratic Party for over half a century. Since McCormick had long advocated building a convention center, after it was built from 1957 to 1960 McCormick Place was named for him. The trust eventually divested its ownership of the Tribune Company, so in 2008 changed its name from the McCormick Tribune Foundation to the Robert R. McCormick Foundation. It contributed more than a billion US dollars for journalism, early childhood education, civic health, social and economic services, arts and culture and citizenship. Additionally, McCormick endowed five scholarships at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and deeded his Aiken, South Carolina estate to friend and former commander Charles Pelot Summerall with the stipulation that the General live there the remainder of his life. After Summerall's death in 1954, the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, now known as the Robert R. McCormick Citadel Beach Club. The structure was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events. McCormick's legacy also extended to Canada, his grandfather Joseph Medill's birthplace. Six towns were created for the purpose of forestry and journal paper production: Heron Bay (Ont.), Gore Bay (Ont), Thorold (Ont.), Baie- Comeau (Que), Franquelin (Que) and Shelter Bay (Que), known as Port-Cartier today. These towns still exist and if yesterdays productions are no longer what make them thrive, the memories of the Colonel are remembered and honored. Many monuments have been made in honor of the Colonel, in Baie-Comeau lay the biggest of them all, a bronze statue of the Colonel canoeing as he did in 1915 when he discovered the land that would welcome the town in 1937. The monument was made by Wheeler Williams an American sculptor. In 1955 the Quebec & Ontario Transportation Company renamed the cargo vessel the Manicouagan the Col. Robert R. McCormick.

Notice the characteristic shape of the 62 cl clavelin bottle. Ch√¢teau-Chalon is an Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e for wines made in the Jura wine region of France, around the village of Ch√¢teau-Chalon. Only white wines from the Savagnin grape made in the vin jaune (\\"yellow wine\\") style can be made using this appellation. However, the Ch√¢teau-Chalon wines are not explicitly labeled as vin jaune. It is bottled in the traditional bottle called clavelin that is of a peculiar shape and with a capacity of 62 cl, which is, according to local legend, the amount left of a litre of wine after aging in cask for six years and three months - the legal minimum for Chateau Chalon. Once bottled, the wine is of great longevity, and can age for several decades. Climate and geography Vineyards. Ch√¢teau-Chalon is located in hilly terrain in the eastern French wine region of Jura. The area has a continental climate, which includes very cold winters. The climate during harvest time is normally dry enough to be able to pick the grapes at a late harvest stage, normally in late October. The vineyard soils are composed of limestone marl. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 775 Oxford University Press 2006 Wine production The Ch√¢teau-Chalon AOC is dedicated exclusively to the production of vin jaune wine. There are other appellations within Jura that are permitted to produce AOC vin jaune, most notably the C√¥tes du Jura AOC, but Ch√¢teau-Chalon has specific regulations that are unique to this AOC. To begin with, the grapes must be harvested at brix levels that allow for a potential alcohol content of at least 12% in the finished wine; other regions will allow a minimum of 11.5%. While the grapes are harvested late, they are never botrytized, unlike other well known late harvest French wines such as Sauternes. E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 237-238 Wiley Publishing 2001 After fermentation the wine must be stored for at least six years and three months prior to bottling. The majority of time is spent in wood casks that are only partially filled, allowing for a film of yeast, known as the voile or \\"veil\\", to develop across the surface. This voile yeast is similar to the benevolent flor yeast that is used in sherry production, and vin jaune shares some similarities in styles to sherry, though vin jaune is not fortified. The producers of Ch√¢teau-Chalon are very particular about quality and will sacrifice an entire year's production, not making any wine, if the weather of a particular vintage was not favorable. In good years, production will average around 2000 hectoliters (52,835 gallons). Wine style The vin jaune wine of Ch√¢teau-Chalon is known for its nutty flavors and aromas, and can develop additional curry notes as the wines ages due to presence of sotolon. The wine's yellow color ranges from pale to deep gold. The wines are often paired with the local AOC designated chicken from the nearby town of Bresse.

The village is situated approximtely to the south west of Birkenhead and north east of Heswall. Historically part of Cheshire, the area is within the Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. At the 2001 census, Thingwall had 3,140 inhabitants. The 2011 census registered the total ward population at 13,007. History From the Old Norse √æing vollr, meaning 'assembly field', the name indicates that it was once the site of a Germanic thing (or √æing). Similar place names in the British Isles include Tynwald, Dingwall, and Tingwall; see also Thingvellir in Iceland and Tingvoll in Norway. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as Tuigvelle, and has been variously known as Fingwalle (1180); Thingale (circa 1250); Thynghwall (1426). Previously a township in Woodchurch Parish, Wirral Hundred, it was added to Birkenhead county borough in 1933. The population was 52 in 1801, 96 in 1851 and 156 in 1901. Traditional buildings/walls in the area are constructed of locally quarried yellow sandstone. Several small sandstone quarries once existed in the area including one at the top of the appropriately named Quarry Lane. Little evidence of these quarries now exists as the land has been redeveloped for housing or for the construction of a second above ground fresh water reservoir. Thingwall Mill was constructed in the eighteenth century on the site of a much older medieval mill. Damaged in a storm in 1897 and subsequently disused, the mill was demolished in 1900. However, remnants of the building, including the original mill stone, can still be found on Mill Road. Thingwall Hall was built in 1849 for a Liverpool merchant and demolished in 1960. It was part of the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital from 1917, providing care for long-term patients. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including Thingwall, transfer from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside. Geography Thingwall lies on the western side of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Hoylake, from the Dee Estuary and about from the River Mersey at Rock Ferry. Thingwall sits at the western side of the wide and shallow glacial U-shaped valley, formed during the Quaternary Ice Age, between Thurstaston Hill and Storeton Ridge. The underlying bedrock is Triassic sandstone of the Helsby Sandstone Formation and the Wilmslow Sandstone Formation, and Triassic siltstone of the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. This is overlain with boulder clay from the Quaternary Ice Age, similar to the nearby Dee Cliffs, and clay soil. The bedrock is not usually visible, as it is at the summit of Thurstaston Hill. Governance Thingwall is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. The village is part of the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current Member of Parliament is Margaret Greenwood, a Labour Party (UK) representative. At local government level, the village is part of the Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Thingwall is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors: Kate Cannon, Michael Collins and Michael Sullivan. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Notable people * Alan Gill and David Balfe, English musicians with the late 70s / early 80s bands Radio Blank, Dalek I Love You and The Teardrop Explodes, both raised in Thingwall. * David Balfe went on to run his own record labels.

The album was released in 1987 and was supported by a single, \\"Addiction\\". The album was further supported by the Head Trauma tour, which spanned across North America and Europe. Ain't it Dead Yet?, a recording of the group performing in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was released on video in 1989 and CD in 1991. Music Cleanse Fold and Manipulate explores a number of different topic concerning medicine, society, and politics. The Song \\"First Aid\\" addresses what was the growing AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, while \\"Second Tooth\\" concerns with the struggles faced by Vietnam War veterans, namely post-traumatic stress. The song \\"Deep Down Trauma Hounds\\" was written following a string of teenage suicides in the United States. Nivek Ogre, the group's vocalist and songwriter, said of the suicides: Other songs on the album pay homage to horror films. The song \\"The Mourn\\" is based on the Japanese extreme horror movie Flower of Flesh and Blood from the Guinea Pig film series. According to the group, the film was the closest they had ever come to seeing what they felt was a real snuff movie. Footage from the film has since been used in their live shows. Release Cleanse Fold and Manipulate was released on June 25, 1987. Eyeball paperweights were distributed by Capitol Records to help promote the album. The record sold 80,000 copies by October 1988, with 90 percent of sales being outside Canada. = Critical reception = Tim DiGravina of Allmusic said the album was \\"hard to recommend\\". He went on to say while it did contain one of the band's best songs, \\"Deep Down Trauma Hounds\\", much of the album was ambient and fragmentary. Still, he added, \\"fans of industrial music will appreciate the album's formidable beats and coarse sound samples that seem to be generated from warping the sounds of heavy machinery. Perhaps more than other any place in Skinny Puppy's discography, Ogre's vocals work like spoken- word stream-of-conscious dementia, with more emphasis on evil tones than on any relation to their music\\". He concluded by saying the album was primarily recommendable to die hard fans. Evelyn Erskine from the Ottawa Citizen gave the album a favorable review, saying the album was \\"dark and frightening\\", and described the flow of its songs as \\"cinematic\\". Erskine remarked that the album was weakened by the band's overreliance on gothic horror elements. Billboard magazine recommended the album, calling it \\"the right combination of gloom-and-doom lyrics and throbbing, metallic music\\". People magazine said listening to the album was \\"like stepping into a nightmare being experienced by the Phantom of the Opera\\" and concluded that the band was \\"too garish for extended exposure but, in small doses, they are extremely powerful\\". Mike Saunders of the Sun-Sentinel thought the album was an intriguing accomplishment, but that the initial \\"voyeuristic thrill\\" received from listening wears off before the album ends. Frances Litman from the Times Colonist thought the album was tamer than the band's previous work and only recommended it to club-goers.

Note: this list of all 121 parks is the default reference for current individual Pennsylvania state parks. The Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks, a division of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), is the governing body for all these parks, and directly operates 113 of them. The remaining eight are operated in cooperation with other public and private organizations. The first Pennsylvania state park, at Valley Forge, opened in 1893 and was given to the National Park Service (NPS) for America's bicentennial in 1976. There are a total of seventeen former Pennsylvania state parks: four former parks have been transferred to the NPS, four to the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission, two to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one to both the Corps and the Pennsylvania Game Commission, five to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, and one has ceased to exist. Nine current and two former state parks have had major name changes or have been known under alternate names. The list gives an overview of Pennsylvania state parks and a brief history of their development since the first park opened in 1893. State parks range in size from to , with nearly one percent (0.96%) of Pennsylvania's land as state park land. According to Dan Cupper (1993), \\"Pennsylvania is the thirty-third largest state, but only Alaska and California have more park land\\". Note: URL is to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection reprint of article Overview There are state parks in 61 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, which nearly reaches Pennsylvania's goal of having a state park within 25 miles (40 km) of every resident in the Commonwealth. Eleven of the 121 parks do not have \\"State Park\\" in their name. Three are \\"Conservation Areas\\": Boyd Big Tree Preserve, Joseph E. Ibberson, and Varden; four are \\"Environmental Education Centers\\": Jacobsburg, Jennings, Kings Gap (also a \\"Training Center\\") and Nolde Forest; White Clay Creek is a \\"Preserve\\"; Norristown is a \\"Farm Park\\"; and Big Spring is a \\"State Forest Picnic Area\\". Seven parks are undeveloped with no facilities: Allegheny Islands, Benjamin Rush, Bucktail, Erie Bluffs, Prompton, Swatara, and Varden; the last four of these are in the process of being developed. Five state parks are small picnic areas: Laurel Summit, Patterson, Prouty Place, Sand Bridge, and Upper Pine Bottom. Five state parks have major U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams and/or lakes: Bald Eagle, Beltzville, Elk, Kettle Creek, and Sinnemahoning. Three former parks now belong, at least partly, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Seven parks preserve the industrial past: Canoe Creek is the site of a former lime kiln, and Caledonia, French Creek, Greenwood Furnace, Kings Gap, Mont Alto, and Pine Grove Furnace (plus one former park) are all former iron furnace sites. Eight current parks and one former park contain at least part of eight different National Natural Landmarks. According to the DCNR, the 121 state parks in Pennsylvania are on more than with some 606 full-time and more than 1,600 part-time employees serving approximately 36 million visitors each year. Admission to all Pennsylvania state parks is free, although there are fees charged for use of cabins, marinas, etc. Pennsylvania's 121 state parks offer \\"over 7,000 family campsites, 286 cabins, nearly 30,000 picnic tables, 56 major recreational lakes, 10 marinas, 61 beaches for swimming, 17 swimming pools\\" and over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of trails. {style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" Image:PresqueIsleStatePark.JPGPresque Isle State Park, on Lake Erie Image:Worlds End State Park Far View.jpgWorlds End State Park, Loyalsock Creek canyon Image:PittSkyline082904.jpgPoint State Park, in downtown Pittsburgh Image:Jonathan's Run Falls.jpgOhiopyle State Park, Jonathan Run Falls } =History= Pennsylvania's first state park was Valley Forge State Park, purchased by the Commonwealth on May 30, 1893 to preserve Valley Forge. It was transferred to the National Park Service (NPS) on the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Many state parks still preserve history: as of 2012, forty-two Pennsylvania state park sites are on the National Register of Historic Places, including two National Historic Landmarks (Delaware Canal and Point), twenty-eight Civilian Conservation Corps sites in nineteen parks, and twelve other parks' historic sites and districts. Eight of the former state parks were also chiefly historic. In addition to preserving historic sites, Pennsylvania also sought to preserve natural beauty and offer opportunities for recreation in its state parks. In 1902 Mont Alto State Forest Park was the second park established, a year after the state \\"Bureau of Forestry\\" was set up to purchase, preserve, and restore Pennsylvania's forests, which had been ravaged by lumbering, charcoal production, and wild fires. Parks were added sporadically until the 1930s, some mere camping and picnic areas in state forests, while others preserved unique sites. The 1930s saw a great expansion of parks and their facilities under Governor Gifford Pinchot, who cooperated with President Franklin Roosevelt, despite their being of different political parties. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) established 113 CCC camps in Pennsylvania (second only to California). Using CCC and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor, the NPS built five Recreation Demonstration Areas, which became Pennsylvania state parks in 1945 and 1946: Blue Knob, French Creek, Hickory Run, Laurel Hill, and Raccoon Creek. The CCC also \\"fought forest fires, planted trees, built roads, buildings, picnic areas, swimming areas, campgrounds and created many state parks\\". In 1956, there were forty-four state parks in Pennsylvania, mostly in rural areas. Forty-five parks had been added by 1979, mostly near urban areas, and the system had increased by . This was thanks largely to the efforts of Maurice K. Goddard, who served as director of the precursors to the DCNR for twenty-four years under six administrations. The number of visitors to parks more than tripled in this time and two voter approved bond issues (Projects 70 and 500) raised millions of dollars for park expansions and improvements. All this expansion was not without costs and by 1988 there was an estimated $90 million in deferred maintenance. In 1993, as the park system celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary, new tax and bond revenues were earmarked for the parks. Since 2000, parks are being improved through the state's Growing Greener and Growing Greener II and bond programs.

As of 2012, three Pennsylvania state parks are also the site of ski areas run by private contractors: Big Pocono (Ski Camelback), Blue Knob (Ski Blue Knob), and Denton Hill (Ski Denton). (Two other state parks had commercial ski operations in the past Laurel Mountain (from 1939 to 2005) and Black Moshannon (from 1965 to 1982).) Two parks are operated by other governmental bodies: Hillman (managed for hunting by the Pennsylvania Game Commission) and Norristown Farm (operated by the Montgomery County Department of Parks). Three parks are operated by other organizations: Susquehanna (operated by the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce), Prompton (operated by non-profit \\"Friends of Prompton\\"), and Salt Springs (operated by non-profit \\"Friends of Salt Springs\\"). :b. The Pennsylvania counties without state parks as of 2012 are: Armstrong, Juniata, Lehigh, Montour, Snyder, and Wyoming counties. Two of these counties are sites of former state parks: Crooked Creek in Armstrong County, and Snyder- Middleswarth in Snyder County. :c. The goal of having a state park within 25 miles (40 km) of every resident was set by Maurice K. Goddard (Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, and then of the Department of Environmental Resources from 1955 to 1979). :d. The seven National Natural Landmarks at least partly within current state parks (with the park name in parentheses, if different) are: Cook Forest, Ferncliff Peninsula (Ohiopyle), the Glens Natural Area (Ricketts Glen), Hickory Run Boulder Field (Hickory Run), McConnells Mill, the Pine Creek Gorge (includes Colton Point and Leonard Harrison), and Presque Isle. One National Natural Landmark, Snyder Middleswarth Natural Area, is a former state park. :e. The date of establishment for many Pennsylvania state parks is not always clear, especially for parks developed from state forest property. As an example, consider Upper Pine Bottom, which, as of 2012, is a picnic area surrounded by Tiadaghton State Forest. These state forest lands were acquired by the state by the early 1900s, the site was \\"Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Campground\\" by 1924, the CCC built a pavilion there in 1936 (which is no longer extant), but it was not officially transferred from the Bureau of Forests to State Parks until 1962. :f. This park was one of twenty-five chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" list. :g. This park has one or more historic sites or districts on the National Register of Historic Places. :h. There have been a considerable number of changes in Pennsylvania's categorization of its state parks and other protected areas over the years, so that what can be called a former state park is not always clear. This can be seen by comparing the following three lists from 1923, 1924, and 1937. In 1923, the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters listed seven \\"State Forest Parks\\": Caledonia, Childs (now part of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area), Hairy John's (now a picnic area in Bald Eagle State Forest), James Buchanan, Leonard Harrison, Mont Alto, and Valhalla (now Ole Bull). Note this does not include Snyder-Middleswarth State Forest Park, established in 1921. One year later the state listed twenty-six public campgrounds in state forests, which included three of the previous year's state forest parks, plus twelve sites that later became state parks. The ten Class A Public Campgrounds (with space for cars and tents, on main highways) were: Adams Falls (now Linn Run), Big Spring, Caledonia, Childs, Colerain Forge, Darling Run, Laurel Run Park, Ole Bull, Promised Land, and Tea Springs. The sixteen Class B Public Campgrounds (lean-to shelter, on secondary roads) were: Baldwin, Bear Valley, Cherry Springs Drive, Clear Creek, Donnelly, Joyce Kilmer, Kansas, Kooser, Laurel Hill Summit (now Laurel Summit), Laurel Lake Park, Locusts, McCall's Dam, Ravensburg, Sizerville, Sulphur Springs, and Upper Pine Bottom. In 1937, the state published a brochure listing the following forty-nine protected areas: six State Parks (Caledonia, Childs, Cook Forest, Presque Isle, Pymatuning, and Ralph Stover); eight State Monuments (Bushy Run, Conrad Weiser, Drake Well, Fort Necessity, Fort Washington, James Buchanan, Valley Forge, and Washington Crossing); ten Forest Recreational Reserves (Clear Creek, Colton Point, Cowans Gap, Kooser Lake, Parker Dam, Pecks Pond, Promised Land Lake, Snow Hill, Whipple Dam, Whirl's End); sixteen Wayside Areas (Big Spring, Black Moshannon, Cherry Spring, Colerain, Greenwood Furnace, Halfway (now R.B. Winter), Joyce Kilmer, Kettle Creek, Mont Alto, Pine Grove Furnace, Reeds Gap, S.B. Elliott, Sideling Hill, Sizerville, and Tea Spring); seven Forest Monuments (Alan Seeger, Bear Meadows, Ole Bull, Detweiler Run, McConnell Narrows, Mount Logan, and Snyder-Middleswarth); and three State Forest Lookouts (Leonard Harrison, Martins Hill, and Mount Riansares). Only twelve of the twenty-six public campgrounds from 1924 are on the 1937 list. Of the forty-nine areas on the 1937 list, twenty-eight are state parks as of 2012, while nine are former state parks, and twelve are in state forests (eight of these still retain their names as state forest picnic, natural or wild areas).

He served as 1949 President of the Soil Science Society of America.Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 75:1179‚Äì1188 doi:10.2136/sssaj2010.0107pres_and_yearly_reports  Overview  Hans Jenny was born in Basel, Switzerland. He earned a diploma in agriculture from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in 1922, and a D. Sc. degree in 1927 for a thesis on ion exchange reactions. Following an appointment at the University of Missouri, he joined the faculty at Berkeley in 1936. International recognition came to Jenny after the 1941 publication of Factors of Soil Formation: A System of Quantitative Pedology. His synthesis of field studies with the abstract formalism of physical chemistry set down the generic mathematical relationship that connects the observed properties of soil with the independent factors that determine the process of soil formation: s = f(cl, o, r, p, t, ...) where s - soil properties; cl - regional climate; o - potential biota, r - relief; p - parent material; t - time. Jenny left the ellipsis open to indicate that there might be other variables in the function. In The Soil Resource, Origin and Behaviour (1980), Jenny redefined the soil forming factors as state variables and extended the effects to ecosystem properties. Parent material and relief define the initial state for soil development, regional climate, and potential biota determine the rate at which chemical and biological transformations proceed, and time determines the reach of these processes, and their expression in ecosystem, soil, vegetation, and animal component properties. One notable project was his study of the Mendocino pygmy forest, a remarkable community of ericaceous and coniferous plant species whose stunted growth and grotesquely twisted morphology reveal a long and tortured struggle for survival on a 500,000-year-old marine terrace. The University of California's Jenny Pygmy Forest Reserve is named in his honor, and is found adjacent to Van Damme State Park. Jenny did much of his pygmy forest research within the boundaries of Jug Handle State Natural Reserve, which, as a result of Hans and his wife Jean's lobbying was designated the Pygmy Forest National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1974. Jenny applied fundamental soil science to the problems of the day, when he wrote about \\"the rosy outlook that is sweeping the nation about converting biomass to alcohol and gasohol...We are promised construction of ingenious machines that will pick up all crop residues in the fields and leaf litter and humus in the forests. The carbon and nitrogen cycles of ecosystems will be curtailed and soil stability endangered. Because of a possible climatic warm-up, we do not wish to accelerate humus oxidation and the concomitant flux of carbon dioxide from soil into the atmosphere. I am arguing against indiscriminate conversion of biomass and organic wastes to fuels. The humus capital, which is substantial, deserves being maintained because good soils are a national asset.\\"  Bibliography  * Jenny, Hans (1929) Relation of temperature to the amount of nitrogen in soils.

Life and career Jenny was born in Basel, Switzerland. After completing a doctorate he taught science at the Rudolph Steiner School in Z√ºrich for four years before beginning medical practice. In 1967, Jenny published the first volume of Cymatics: The Study of Wave Phenomena. The second volume came out in 1972, the year he died. This book was a written and photographic documentation of the effects of sound vibrations on fluids, powders and liquid paste. He concluded, \\"This is not an unregulated chaos; it is a dynamic but ordered pattern.\\" Jenny made use of crystal oscillators and his so-called tonoscope to set plates and membranes vibrating. He spread quartz sand onto a black drum membrane 60 cm in diameter. The membrane was caused to vibrate by singing loudly through a cardboard pipe, and the sand produced symmetrical Chladni patterns, named after Ernst Chladni, who had discovered this phenomenon in 1787. Low tones resulted in rather simple and clear pictures, while higher tones formed more complex structures.Deschin, Jacob (April 28, 1968). Science Vibrates to Make Pictures. New York Times Legacy Chladni's and Jenny's work influenced Alvin Lucier and helped lead to his composition Queen of the South. Cymatics was also followed up by Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) founder Gy√∂rgy Kepes at MIT. His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made visible by this setup. A special edition of the Hafler Trio's work Exactly As I Say includes a DVD containing material said to be \\"based on and extended from techniques suggested by Prof. Hans Jenny\\". Photographer Alexander Lauterwasser has also captured imagery of water surfaces set into motion by sound sources ranging from sine waves to music by Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen and overtone singing.

He spent the majority of his playing career in the United States after moving there in 1992, most notably for Chicago Fire and D.C. United. His DC team won the MLS Cup in 2004. He retired from the game in February 2011 after being released by Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the 2010 season. He now coaches for Oakbrook soccer club in Illinois  Career  = Early life and amateur = Born in Kiev, Ukraine SSR, Soviet Union, Kovalenko emigrated to the United States in 1992. He graduated from Greece Arcadia High School in Rochester, New York in 1996, and played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1996 to 1998, where he helped the Hoosiers win a national championship in 1998, and was named an NCAA first team All-American in the same year. Was long known in college for his powerful headers, which often left opponents stunned and unable to react to deflections from the goalkeeper or posts. Kovalenko often attributed this to his well developed neck muscles that he said were created from doing hundreds of sets of Ukrainian neck-snaps daily prior to his soccer training. = Professional = Upon joining the league, Kovalenko was originally allocated to the Dallas Burn, but the league complied with his demands to play for the Chicago Fire, engineering a trade to the team in exchange for draft picks. Kovalenko appeared infrequently in his rookie year, playing only 291 minutes in 11 games, but managed to score three goals for the team. Kovalenko made an impact another way, breaking the leg, and effectively ending the career, of Dallas Burn defender Brandon Pollard with a dangerous tackle. Kovalenko would come into his own as a player in the 2000 season, scoring ten goals and five assists in 31 games for the Fire, as he helped the team to a U.S. Open Cup victory. The next year, he was moved from a forward position to attacking midfield, but continued to catalyze the Fire offense, scoring eight goals and seven assists in 25 games. In 2001, Kovalenko had trouble scoring, registering only one goal with his eight assists, but was still a dangerous offensive player for the team. After the 2001 MLS season, Kovalenko played on loan for FC St. Pauli of the German Bundesliga. Following the 2002 season he was traded, largely because of salary cap problems, to D.C. United in exchange for youngster Justin Mapp. Kovalenko immediately established himself with United, scoring six goals in 24 games in his first season with the team. Also, in what seemed like something of a recurring trend, Kovalenko was again involved in a Dallas Burn injury, when another late tackle broke Burn midfielder Ronnie O'Brien's leg, causing him to miss most of the regular season. Kovalenko was fined $1,000 and suspended one game for his actions. Kovalenko continued to be a valuable player in central midfield for D.C. United in 2004, registering two goals and ten assists for the team in 25 games. He was ejected from the championship game for a handball, but DC United held on to win. In 2005, despite losing the early part of the season to a broken foot, he tallied four goals and four assists. He left DC United in January 2006, after being unable to agree on salary terms, and returned to Ukraine. He signed a one-year contract with FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhya. In August 2006, Kovalenko returned to MLS, after his rights were acquired by New York Red Bulls from DC. The fiery Ukrainian's play in the beginning of the 2007 season had New York challenging in the Eastern Conference, however he was sidelined with injury and the team began to struggle. Kovalenko was able to return during the latter part of the season, helping the club clinch a playoff berth. He concluded the season appearing in 19 league matches, registering two goals and one assist. He was traded to Real Salt Lake in February 2008. On 14 January 2009, Salt Lake traded Kovalenko to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a draft pick and an undisclosed sum of allocation money. On 3 December 2010, LA Galaxy announced Kovalenko's contract would not be renewed for the 2011 MLS season. Kovalenko elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a Major League Soccer free agent when he was not selected by any club. Having been unable to secure a spot on a professional roster for the upcoming season, Kovalenko confirmed his retirement in an interview on 14 February 2011.  Honors  D.C.

Reynolds Metals was acquired by Alcoa in Reynolds Metals became known for the consumer product Reynolds Wrap foil, as well as for developing and promoting new uses for aluminum. Its RV Aluminaut submarine was operated by Reynolds Submarine Services Corporation. It was headquartered for most of its existence in Richmond, Virginia; the Modernist style Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters was built there in 1958. History The Reynolds Metals Company was founded in 1919 as the U.S. Foil Company in Louisville, Kentucky, by Richard S. Reynolds, Sr., nephew of tobacco king R. J. Reynolds. Initially, the new company supplied lead and tin foil wrappers to cigarette and candy companies. In 1924, U.S. Foil purchased the manufacturer of Eskimo Pies, which were wrapped in foil. In 1928, Reynolds purchased Robertshaw Thermostat, Fulton Sylphon, and part of Beechnut Foil, adding them to U.S. Foil to create Reynolds Metals. In 1931, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and in 1938 the headquarters moved again to Richmond, Virginia. The company began producing aluminum foil for packaging in 1926. Reynolds Metals created the first high-speed, gravure-printed foil, aluminum bottle labels, heat- sealed foil bags for foods and foil-laminated building insulation paper. In 1940 Reynolds Metals began mining bauxite (aluminum ore) in Bauxite, Arkansas and opened its first aluminum plant near Sheffield, Alabama, the following year. In 1947, the company released Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil. Reynolds Metals pioneered the development of aluminum siding in 1945, and Richard S. Reynolds began predicting a growing demand for additional aluminum during peacetime. He believed new aluminum-producing facilities would need to be built to meet demand. Reynolds Metals Company leased, and later bought, six government defense plants that were up for disposal. Reynolds later expanded into non aluminum products such as plastics and precious metals, introducing Reynolds Plastic Wrap in 1982. After the Second World War, the sense of aluminum's utility expanded to include its ornamental characteristics. By repurposing military by-products into consumer goods, aluminum was now being marketed for its decorative appeal as well, creating a product of both functional and eye-catching qualities. Reynolds advertised aluminum for its multi-faceted property, now reaching areas of fashion, home improvement, and architecture. Reynolds marketed aluminum foil as gift wrap, aluminum yarn for Vogue dress patterns, and even extended their advertising strategy to include wrapping their office headquarters in aluminum. Four sons of founder Richard S. Reynolds, William G. Reynolds, Richard S. Reynolds, Jr., David P. Reynolds, and J. Louis Reynolds, were all part of the running of the business. Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. succeeded his father as president in 1948 and under his leadership, the company underwent a major expansion with operations extended to countries around the world such as Venezuela and the Philippines. In 1976 David P. Reynolds, also known for his involvement in Thoroughbred horse racing, took over as president. He was the last member of his family to head the company and would retire as chairman. Reynolds Metals developed other, less well-known products; not all became commercially viable, such as an aluminum bus developed with Rohr Industries, a 12 foot aluminum utility boat, and other aluminum motor vehicles., The aluminum vehicles were surpassed in weight and cost by steel, plastics and fiberglass. However, when Reynolds Metals developed the world's first aluminum submarine, the Aluminaut, the experimental product participated in a key rescue. In 1969, Aluminaut rescued Alvin (DSV-2). Aluminaut's assistance enabled Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to continue operating its submersible. Alvin's work continues 45 years later. By 1991, Reynolds Metals employed 30,800 workers at more than 100 operations in 20 countries, including 64 plants in the United States, and had a total production capacity of more than 1 million tons of aluminum and aluminum products. The company was acquired by Alcoa on May 3, 2000 to become the largest aluminum company in the United States. On January 21, 2008, Alcoa sold its consumer unit to Rank Group Ltd. Rank's owner, New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart, renamed Alcoa's former unit the Reynolds Packaging Group. Hart merged his other packaging companies into Reynolds to create Reynolds Group Holdings. In an initiative led by Paul D. Thomas, Reynolds Packaging Group chief executive officer and a former Alcoa executive, on September 21, 2008, Reynolds announced that one of the foil plants that produced Reynolds Wrap, in downtown Richmond, Virginia, would be closed and foil operations moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where Reynolds Wrap first was produced. A small portion of the spooling operation from the Richmond Foil plant was moved to the Reynolds plant in Grove City, Pennsylvania, in early 2010. Hart later closed five other plants within Reynolds. As a reflection of the recessionary times, salaries were frozen and salaried employees were not given pay raises. Union employees with fixed compensation contracts did receive incentive compensation. In early 2010 all pay was unfrozen. Salaried employees have since received pay adjustments. Headquarters The former Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters building is in Henrico County, Virginia, near Richmond. Built , is a Modernist building designed by the architect Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. During its use by Reynolds, the Executive Office Building was known as Reynolds EXO. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places, one of the rare mid‚àí20th century buildings on the list.National Register properties in Henrico County, VA Properties are generally eligible for inclusion 50 years after construction. Making extensive use of aluminum, down to threads in the carpeting, it is now owned by the University of Richmond and serves as the worldwide headquarters of Altria Group. Consumer products Reynolds Wrap was first made by a Reynolds Metals Company division, Reynolds Packaging, a business created to supply aluminum foil for packaging tobacco. When Alcoa purchased Reynolds Metals, it shed some non-metals packaging and printing businesses but preserved the Reynolds consumer brand, as well as the Reynolds Kitchens, which are still across the street from the former Reynolds headquarters building. Alcoa's Reynolds division was a leader in household baking and cooking products, which included Cut-Rite Wax Paper. Reynolds published cookbooks such as Outdoor Cooking with Reynolds Wrap (1950) and Casual Cooking (1954) in an attempt to promote the sales of Reynolds Wrap. In 1958, the company launched the \\"Designs for Giving\\" campaign, in which professional artists and designers were hired to create special patterns for gift wrapping. Designs included \\"Birds and Bees\\" for baby showers, \\"Born Lucky, Born Rich\\" for birthdays, and \\"Flight of Fancy\\" for weddings or Christmas. Reynolds Consumer Products went public with an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol REYN on Friday, January 31, 2020.

The character was created and performed by Peter Sellers. Bluebottle is an adenoidal squeaky-voiced Boy Scout from East Finchley (the same neighborhood of London where Peter Sellers grew up). He was noted for reading his own stage directions out loud, and was often greeted with a deliberate round of applause from the audience (\\"Enter Bluebottle wearing string and cardboard pyjamas. Waits for audience applause. Not a sausage.\\") As was common with Goon Show characters, Sellers' Bluebottle was paired with a Spike Milligan character, usually Eccles (the third Goon, Harry Secombe, usually stayed in his alter-ego of Neddie Seagoon throughout the show). Bluebottle is also prone to humorous misnaming of characters, including himself. For example, he has referred to himself as \\"Blunebottle\\" and \\"Blatbottle\\" on occasion. Other characters are often misnamed as well, including \\"Count Morinanty\\" for Count Jim Moriarty, \\"Robinge Hood\\" for Robin Hood and \\"Miss Balustrade\\" for Minnie Bannister. Neddie is always \\"My Captain\\", pronounced with four syllables [ma-cap-i-tain]. In \\"The Yehti\\" he reads his own name as \\"Blunbintle\\". According to The Goon Show Companion, Bluebottle was originally known as Ernie Splutmuscle.The Goon Show Companion, Roger Wilmut and Jimmy Grafton. 1976, Robson Books Ltd, Bolsover. pp 91. In the third series episode \\"The Man Who Never Was\\", he was cast in a small role. Seagoon strides across the ceiling of his club, hurling members to the floor. He bumps into Splutmuscle: Four shows later, in the episode \\"The Greatest Mountain in the World\\", the script refers to \\"Peter (Bluebottle)\\". Early in season 5, Bluebottle would enter with a direct appeal to the audience: \\"Bluebottle enters, waits for audience applause. Not a sausage.\\" As the character became more popular, he would actually earn the applause that he sought, which he would acknowledge with a grateful, \\"Oh! Sausinges!\\" In later seasons, no request or response was needed: Bluebottle's entry into the show would generate a loud, sustained applause by itself. Bluebottle was often killed during the course of an episode. This would be punctuated by a lamentation such as, \\"You rotten swine! You've deaded me!\\" After a while, the character began to anticipate this fate, noting at the appearance of a dangerous prop that \\"the dreaded deading\\" is approaching. Bluebottle's death became so regular that at the close of the season 6 episode \\"The Fear of Wages\\", he asks Wallace Greenslade to make a special announcement \\"that I have not been deaded this week\\". Origin Bluebottle was based on Ruxton Hayward, a Scoutmaster Sellers once met. In an interview with Michael Parkinson, Sellers described trying to keep a straight face while talking with a large red-bearded Scout leader who nevertheless spoke in a falsetto voice and had an ingratiating manner. The identity of the individual was later revealed in The Goons,The Goons, edited by Norma Evans, Virgin Publishing 1997 one of several books featuring memoirs and scripts from The Goon Show. Cultural references * The character \\"Pierre\\" in the British animated series Count Duckula (and later a similar character on Victor and Hugo) was voiced by David Jason with a voice almost identical to Bluebottle's. * Geoffrey Rush (playing Peter Sellers) thanks a crowd who attended the premiere of one of the Pink Panther movies in character as Bluebottle in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. * Douglas Adams, in his book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe wrote a line of dialogue for the character Marvin, the Paranoid Android that said: \\"Nothing. Not an electronic sausage.\\" Douglas Adams often acknowledged having been influenced by the Goons. *John Lennon delivers a verse of the Beatles song \\"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\\" in a voice similar to that of Bluebottle.

Alcohol is added to the must to halt fermentation while sugar levels are still high, preserving the natural sweetness of the grape. The wines are then matured in oak barrels, or outside in glass bottles exposed to the sun, allowing the wine to maderise. The maturation period is a minimum of ten months for Banyuls AOC. The resulting wine bears a similarity to port but tends to be lower in alcohol (‚âà16% vs. ‚âà20%). Grapes and wines Most wines are red, although some white wines are produced. Permitted grape varieties are Grenache noir (at least 50%, 75% for the Grand Cru), Grenache gris, Grenache blanc and Carignan, and also (but rarely used) Macabeu, Muscat and Malvoisie.

Her 1923 book The End of the House of Alard became a best-seller, and gave her prominence; it was followed by other successes, and her books enjoyed worldwide sales. Interest in her novel Joanna Godden (1921) was revived after it was adapted as a film titled The Loves of Joanna Godden (1947), which had a different conclusion. In the 1980s, this novel and Susan Spray were reissued by Virago press. Life St Theresa of Lisieux Church The daughter of a physician and his wife, Sheila Kaye-Smith was born in St Leonards-on-Sea, near Hastings, in Sussex. She lived most of her life in that county, apart from a period in London in her youth. She was a distant relative of writer M. M. Kaye (The Far Pavilions). In 1924 Kaye-Smith married Theodore Penrose Fry, an Anglican clergyman. The following year she published a book on Anglo-Catholicism. By 1929 she and her husband had converted to the Roman Catholic Church. Penrose Fry had to give up his Anglican curacy, and they moved to Northiam in Sussex, where they lived in a large converted oast house. Soon afterwards, having noted their own and some of their neighbours' need for a nearby church, they bought land on which they established a Catholic chapel dedicated to St Theresa of Lisieux, at Northiam. It still has a large congregation. Kaye-Smith is buried in the churchyard there. Their house, Little Doucegrove, was later owned by novelist Rumer Godden, another writer who had converted to Catholicism. A new biography of Kaye-Smith by Shaun Cooper, The Shining Cord, was published by Country Books in June 2017. Writing Kaye-Smith's fiction was noted for being rooted in rural concerns: the nineteenth-century agricultural depression, farming, legacies, land rents, strikes, the changing position of women, and the effects of industrialisation on the countryside and provincial life. Admirers of her work included her close friend G. B. Stern. They collaborated on two books about authors Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, and No√´l Coward. Kaye-Smith's novels encompassed more than one genre of fiction. Her earliest novels partly fit into the 'earthy' rural category, together with those of Mary E Mann, Mary Webb, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Hardy. This genre inspired Stella Gibbons's parody Cold Comfort Farm (1932). Kaye-Smith's response to the latter was amusement: she placed a good-natured riposte in her novel A Valiant Woman (1939), set in a rapidly modernising village undergoing some gentrification. (Pearce, 2008). A subplot has an upper middle-class teenager, Lucia, turn from writing twee rural poems to undertake the great Urban Proletarian Novel: \\"‚Ä¶ all about people who aren't married going to bed in a Manchester slum and talking about the Means Test.\\" Her philistine grandmother is dismayed, as she prefers cosy rural novels and knows Lucia is ignorant of proletarian life: > That silly child! Did she really think she could write a novel? Well, of > course, modern novels might encourage her to think so. There was nothing > written nowadays worth reading. The book on her knee was called Cold Comfort > Farm and had been written by a young woman who was said to be very clever > and had won an important literary prize. But she couldn't get on with it at > all. It was about life on a farm, but the girl obviously knew nothing about > country life. To anyone who, like herself, had always lived in the country, > the whole thing was too ridiculous and impossible for words. Kaye-Smith's descriptions of the Sussex countryside, coast and marsh are still regarded as some of the finest. Several of her heroines are single parents and most face various gender-related trials, reflecting her early feminism as well as influences such as George Moore and Thomas Hardy (Pearce, 2004). Kaye-Smith also produced many short stories, and her journalism was published in national journals, magazines and newspapers. Joanna Godden (1921), arguably Kaye- Smith's most famous novel, was set in Romney Marsh. More than two decades later, a film adaptation was made, released in 1947 as The Loves of Joanna Godden. Starring Googie Withers, it had a score by noted composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. The screenplay by H. E. Bates includes however a very different conclusion to the story. Kaye-Smith's later books increasingly reflected her personal religious preoccupations, featuring characters tussling with spiritual crises and conversions within subtle discussions of the differences among Anglicanism, Anglo-Catholicism, and Catholicism. Her plots (e.g. in The Lardners and the Laurelwoods, A Valiant Woman, and Mrs Gailey) continued to reflect pre- and post-WW2 preoccupations of women's \\"middle-brow\\" fiction of the time. She explored national anxieties about social class, divorce, and women's \\"role\\", within a mainly rural but rapidly modernising milieu (Pearce, 2004, 2005). Her books share similarities with contemporary writers such as Barbara Pym, Marghanita Laski and H. E. Bates. Her descriptions of farming practices and economics, and village vernacular, are noted as particularly detailed and accurate for this genre (Cavalliero, 1977). Joanna Godden and Susan Spray were reissued in the 1980s by feminist publishing house Virago. Since then her books are out of print, but are readily available on the used book market. Literary society The Sheila Kaye-Smith literary society is based in St Leonards-on-Sea, meets regularly, and has published a chronology of her life and works, as well producing an annual journal, The Gleam. There are extensive archives relating to Sheila Kaye-Smith in West Sussex County Library in Chichester.

He began his career replacing Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway in UK death metal band Benediction when Greenway decided to focus solely on Napalm Death. Ingram stayed with Benediction until March 1998, when he joined Bolt Thrower, officially replacing Martin van Drunen after having handled vocals temporarily for the band during a show on 4 July 1997 in Zwickau Germany. In 2004, Ingram left Bolt Thrower due to health problems, just prior to the recording of Those Once Loyal. He later performed vocals on an album by Warlord UK and sang in his own band Downlord until the band disbanded in 2008. Later that same year, he began Metal Breakfast Radio, an online metal show that reviews new music from underground bands in a unique and somewhat humorous manner. Ingram's own website can be found at www.darksentinel.dk In a departure from his metal roots, Ingram launched a big band jazz and swing themed online streaming radio program called Lambert's Basement. The title of the show is a tribute to his father Lawrence Albert Lambert Ingram. The post-Downlord period saw Ingram involved in a number of other bands and projects. His collaboration with Rogga Johansson lead to the bands Down Among The Dead Men and Echelon. In late 2015, Ingram was announced as the new vocalist for Dutch death metal band Hail of Bullets in anticipation of their appearance at Maryland Deathfest in May 2016. At the conclusion of the band's set, Hail of Bullets guitarist Stephan Geb√©di announced Ingram had joined the band on a permanent basis. (In an odd coincidence, Ingram is again replacing van Drunen.) In July 2019, Benediction announced Ingram had rejoined the band, following Dave Hunt's departure.

They have an outside of a typical boot but a low heel to control the motorcycle. To improve motorcycle safety, motorcycle boots are generally made from a thick, heavy leather and may include energy absorbing and load spreading padding, metal, plastic and/or composite materials to protect the motorcycle rider's feet, ankles and legs in an accident. For use in wet weather, some boots have a waterproof membrane lining such as Gore-Tex or SympaTex. Depending upon how form-fitting the boot is, to allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft may be designed to open lengthwise. If so, Velcro or other hook-and-loop fasteners are typically used on the inner sides of the opening to allow the rider to close the boot over the foot, ankle and leg. This allows for some flexibility for the rider to control the boot's tightness. Some manufacturers also include an internal quick-lacing system between a soft inner leg and the harder outer shell of the boot shaft to further ensure a tight, but comfortable fit. The heel of a racing boot is typically very low: not more than 1/2-inch (13 mm), and sole of the heel and foot is typically rather smooth. A curved plastic or composite plate may be included to cover the shin of the boot to protect the rider's shin. Racing boots A racing boot Similar to touring boots, racing boots are designed for riding a motorcycle on hard pavement (either the street or a race track) and are usually between 10 and 14 inches in height and made from a combination of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a form-fitting, but comfortable boot. The amount of armored protection provided by racing boots is usually greater than touring boots due to the increased potential for injury at the high speeds needed for racing. Typical protection areas are reinforced to protect the shin, instep, ankle (medial and lateral) heel and toes. Often a high-wear pad of metal or composite is attached to the lateral side (outside) of the toe, as this area can contact the ground during extreme cornering. The optimum racing boot has the necessary protection for impact and abrasion while maintaining excellent single-axis flexibility at the ankle between the boot lower and the shaft; for shifting and braking. Styles vary between \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" Boots meaning that some styles are meant to be worn over the bottom leg of the leather race suit, and some are designed to be worn inside the leg, these having a thinner top shaft. Touring / street boots Touring boots by AXO Similar to racing boots, touring boots are designed specifically for riding a motorcycle on hard pavement, but with less armored protection than racing boots since they are intended for riders that typically ride on city streets and highways, not race tracks. They are usually between 10 and 14 inches in height and made from a combination of leather, metal, hard rubber, plastic and/or man-made fabrics to create a form-fitting, but comfortable boot. Motocross boots Motocross boots are designed specifically for off-road, motocross (MX) or all-terrain vehicle riding. To help prevent a rider's feet and legs from being injured, motocross boots are typically much stiffer than regular motorcycle boots or racing boots, but are more flexible than ski boots by comparison. A motocross boot. Modern motocross boots are usually nearly knee-high (about 16 inches in height) and made from a combination of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a very form-fitting, comfortable and tight boot. To allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft of a motocross boot is designed to open lengthwise. Multiple adjustable straps (usually 3 to 4) are deployed along the foot, ankle and shaft of the boot to allow the rider to tighten the boot to his/her preferences and comfort. A curved plastic or composite plate covers the shin of the boot to protect the rider from debris that may be thrown from the front wheel of the motorcycle. Police boots Motorcycle police boots are designed specifically to be worn by motorcycle police officers. Very similar to riding boots, motorcycle police boots are typically knee-high (between 18 and 21 inches in height), the foot and shaft are made from black, smooth-grained, high-gloss leather and the low-heeled sole is made from hard rubber. The boots are typically form-fitting and intended to be worn over breeches or jodhpurs as part of the officer's uniform. The most notable manufacturers for boots to the UK police force are Goldtop (pre 1980s), and Alt-berg (post 1980s). Engineer boots Engineer boots are a long-established style of boots used by people in a number of occupations in addition to motorcyclists. Harness boots Wesco Harness Boots Harness boots are very similar to engineer boots. The boots are most often made of heavy weight leather and range in height from short (10 inches) to extra high (38 inches). The most typical height is between 10 and 18 inches. The most common color is black, but brown harness boots are also made. Harness boots are designed to protect the motorcycle rider from the heat of the exhaust pipes and the engine block and from injury to the foot and leg in the case of an accident while riding and may include a built-in steel toe cap and metal shank in the heel. Whereas engineer boots have a rounded toe, harness boots typically have a square toe. Unlike engineer boots that have an adjustable leather strap across the ankle, harness boots have a non-adjustable system of four leather straps and two metal rings: one strap goes across the top of the foot at the ankle, one strap wraps around the rear of the foot at the ankle and two more straps rise from sole on either side ankle. The four straps are held in place by the two metal rings that are located on either side of the ankle. Typically, these boots possess a pair of pull-straps on either side of the tops of the shafts. Some manufacturers replace these straps with an adjustable leather strap located on the outside top of the shafts, similar to engineer boots. Soles and heels are usually made of hard rubber and may either be relatively flat or may have lugs for increased traction. Harness boots were originally modeled on the square toed boots prevalent in the 19th century, including those worn by American Civil War soldiers. Leather straps and rings were added to this style in the 1960s, creating the modern version of the harness boot, which quickly became a classic. CE certification of motorcycle footwear There is a European standard available for motorcycle boots, and it is a legal requirement in Europe and the UK for these boots to be CE certified . It tests them for resistance to abrasion, penetration by sharp objects and lateral crushing. The label consists of a motorcycle icon, the designation of the test they've passed and then a series of four numbers. The more '2's on the CE label, the more protective the boot. These numbers will be either a '1' for a Level 1 pass (lower protection) or a '2' for a Level 2 pass (higher protection). From the left, the numbers correspond to: the boots' Height, its Abrasion Resistance, its Impact Cut resistance, and its Traverse Rigidity. For Height, 1 is short, and 2 is tall. For other categories, 1 denotes rudimentary protection, while 2 indicates better protection. Along with the numbers ‚Äì if a boot meets the most recent version of the CE standard ‚Äì the label on the boot will read 'EN 13634:2017'. This standard has four mandatory and six optional tests. These optional tests include 'IPA' for ankle or shin protection, 'WR' for water resistance or 'WAD' for the displacement of water from inside. This EN13634 standard is titled \\"Protective footwear for motorcycle riders ‚Äì Requirements and test methods\\". It is a European harmonized standard published throughout Europe and in the UK by BSI. Abrasion resistance: The abrasion resistance test is designed to check how well boots will prevent injury from abrasion. For testing, the boot is divided into two areas ‚Äì Area A covers the sole, front and back of the boot, where you‚Äôre most likely to find stretch panels, and everything else is Area B. Three samples of material are cut from the boot, and each is held against a moving abrasive belt until a hole appears. The shortest time it took for a hole to develop in one of the samples dictates the boot‚Äôs abrasion rating. For basic Level 1 approval, samples cut from area A must last 1.5 seconds, and samples from area B need to last five seconds. To reach the higher Level 2, area A samples need to last 2.5 seconds or longer, while area B must survive at least 12 seconds without wearing through. Impact cut: Next, the boots are tested to see how they‚Äôd hold up if they came up against a sharp object. For this, a blade attached to a mounting block is dropped onto a sample of the boot; apparatus measures how far the blade goes through the boot. The tests use the same areas as the abrasion test (see above) and the blade is dropped at different speeds to test each area. When testing area A, the knife will be dropped at two metres per second (m/s). For a Level 1 and a Level 2 rating, the knife can‚Äôt protrude through the material by more than 25m. Area B is tested by dropping the blade at 2.8m/s. For Level 1 approval, the blade can‚Äôt go through the sample by more than 25mm. To pass Level 2, the maximum it can go through is 15mm. Transverse rigidity: The transverse rigidity test determines how strongly the boot can resist your foot being crushed if a bike‚Äôs weight fell on it. The boot is laid down with the widest part of the foot positioned between two plates. These plates squash together at a rate of 30mm per min. Apparatus records the force required to compress the sole at that rate. The machine is turned off when the plates stop squeezing the sole, when the force is clearly remaining constant or when the sole has been crushed by 20mm. This test is repeated three times. If it took less than 1kN of force to compress the sole to 20mm, the boot fails. If it took 1kN-1.4kN the boot takes a Level 1 pass and if it needed 1.5kN or more to compress the sole it achieves a Level 2 pass. Optional tests: Manufacturers can submit their boots for optional extra tests. Passes in these tests will be represented on the label with letters underneath the mandatory test ratings. The following tests are optional. IPA/IPS ‚Äì Impact protection to the ankle and/or shin: These show boots with approved impact protection. For this test, the boot is cut along the sole and opened up; a striker is used to drop 10 joules of force onto the protector. To pass this test, the protector can‚Äôt allow more than 5kN to be transmitted through it. If the ankle protection passes, the letters IPA will be on the label, and shin armour will be displayed as IPS. WR ‚Äì Resistance to water penetration: Boots that claim to be water resistant should be tested in one of two ways. They can be clamped to a machine with the toes flexing to replicate 4600 steps while the foot is submerged in water, or a person can wear the boot and walk 1km (100 x 10-metre lengths) in shallow water. To pass in either method, areas of dampness inside the boot can be no bigger than 3cm¬≤. FO ‚Äì Resistance to fuel and oil on sole: Two samples of a boot are weighed twice ‚Äì once normally and once in distilled water. The sample is then left soaking in fuel at 23 degrees for 22 hours, taken out and weighed in the same ways again. To pass, the weight of the samples shouldn‚Äôt increase by more than 12%. SRA/SRB/SRC ‚Äì Slip-resistance of sole: Three tests make up the one rating for slip resistance. Each test is done with a mechanical heel set at a seven-degree angle, which moves to imitate different kinds of slips and falls on different surfaces. If the label shows ‚ÄòSRA‚Äô, the sole will have passed on a ceramic tile surface treated with diluted soap. ‚ÄòSRB‚Äô means it passed on a steel floor treated with glycerol. ‚ÄòSRC‚Äô means the boot passed both tests. B ‚Äì Breathability of uppers: If a CE label has the letter B on it, it means the boot has gone through an optional test to check that moisture vapour can escape. WR ‚Äì Water absorption/desorption of inner: The boots are tested to see how much water the insides hold and how much they release. If the boots pass this test, ‚ÄòWAD‚Äô will be displayed on the label.

It is the home of Narara Valley High School, a NSW government public high school, and St Philips Christian College Gosford, a private school educating children from kindergarten to year twelve. It is also home to the Narara Ecovillage, which aims to research, design and build a stylish, intergenerational, friendly demonstration Ecovillage, blending the principles of ecological and social sustainability, good health, business, caring and other options that can evolve from our well-being. Narara also hosts the annual Ecoburbia festival, awarded Best Community Event by Gosford City Council in 2015. The name 'Narara' can be traced back to the local Aboriginal term for 'black snake', which appears on the official emblem of Narara Valley High School and the scarf of 1st Narara Scout Group. Narara's claim to fame is that the Narara Music Festival was held nearby in Somersby in 1983 and 1984. The Angels, an Australian rock band, produced an 11 track live album recorded at the festival named, appropriately enough, \\"Live at Narara\\". Narara largely consisted of orchards and small mixed farms. Water from the small dams that used to be accessible from Narara Creek Road was piped in wooden piping across Narara Creek to the Railway station to supply steam trains.

Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 188 Oxford University Press 2006 History The seaside port of Collioure. Viticulture was likely introduced to the area soon after the ancient Greeks introduced winemaking to the Languedoc are in the 6th century BC. Under the Romans, viticulture spread throughout the area with the nearby cities of Narbonne, Carcassonne and Perpignan being major centers for the trade of Roussillon wine from areas like Collioure.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 213-221 Wiley Publishing 2001 For a large part of its history, the region has been under Spanish rule and was even a part of the Catalonia region until the mid-17th century. Like other Roussillon wine regions, this Spanish influence can be seen in the types of wines produced here.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 294-299 Workman Publishing 2001 Even today, wine experts such as Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson describe the wines of Collioure as being more like Spanish wines in profile than French.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 142 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The history of the Collioure region has been closely linked to the wines of Banyuls. For several centuries, grapes produced in this region was used to produce the fortified wine that gained an international reputation. It wasn't until 1971 that the region gained its own identity with an AOC established for production of non-fortified red wines.A. Domine (ed) Wine pg 329 Ullmann Publishing 2008 Climate and geography The vineyard soils in the Banyuls and Collioure zones vary from more alluvial soils near the coast to more schist-based soils in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The Collioure wine region is located along the Mediterranean coast in the Roussillon district, extending from the coast up to the foothills of the Pyrenees which separates the area from the Spanish wine region of Catalonia across the border. Both the mountains and the sea have strong influences on the region's distinctly Mediterranean climate. During the summer growing season, temperatures are very warm and dry with the potential for drought. In the evening, cool winds from the mountains descend over the vineyards and this can help moderate temperatures for the vines. Vineyard soils in the area range from alluvial soils near the sea and rivers to more gravel, limestone and schist based soils closer to the foothills of the Pyrenees. The soil types will affect the resulting style of wine with the more schist-based soils on the higher slopes of the foothills produced more intense, full bodied wines while the more alluvial soils closer to the sea will produce lighter styles of wine. Viticulture and winemaking Grapes from Collioure are often used in the production of the fortified wine Banyuls. Many producers in Collioure also produce wines under the Banyuls label, which tends to have more prestige and fetch a higher price on the international wine market. The nature of the vintage will usually determine what percentage of Collioure grapes are used for Banyuls and what percentage will remain Collioure. When grapes are destined to become Collioure they are usually harvested a couple of weeks earlier than the grapes that are destined to be fortified. This is because the warm climate of the region causes grape sugars to rise as acids in the grapes drastically fall. While fortified wines value the high percentage of residual sugar from very ripe grapes, non-fortified wines need more of the balance from the remaining acids. Often, though, winemakers will still need to add additional acids such as tartaric acid in a process known as acidification. In a typical vintage about one-third of the grapes harvested in the region will be used for Collioure AOC labeled wines. Grapevines in Collioure are trained as \\"bush vines\\" which, along with their age, contributes to the very low yields of Collioure. In fact, the yields from this area are often among the lowest in France - often lower than the AOC maximum of 2.3 tones per acre (40 hectoliters per hectare). Wines produced in Collioure also must not rise above a maximum alcohol level of 15% (min 12% for red, 11.5% for rose and whites)and residual sugar level of 5 grams per liter. This low sugar levels means that all wines from Collioure are technically dry wines but to wine drinkers they may perceive \\"sweetness\\" due to the very high levels of ripeness the grapes attain in the warm climate of the region. Grapes and wine Grenache is one of the principle grapes grown in the Collioure AOC. The primary grapes of the Collioure AOC are Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre with Carignan and Cinsaut playing minor roles. The Mourvedre planted in Collioure is used almost exclusively for still wine production and is very rarely used in the production of Banyuls. The rose are produced mainly from the red wine grapes that have received very brief skin contact and maceration time or it maybe produced from a saign√©e method where some wine is \\"bleed off\\" from the fermenting vats of red wines before much of the color inducing phenolic compounds have taken hold. This method produces a more intensely flavored and darker colored red wine while at the same time producing a high quality rose. The whites are usually made from Grenache blanc. The red wines of the region are characterized by their rich, full bodied flavors with spice aroma notes. As of 2008, there were an estimated 815 acres (330 hectares) of vineyards planted in the boundaries of the Collioure AOC. In 2002, the enc√©pagement (or permitted grape components of the AOC wine) was changed which included permitting an AOC white wine for the first time. Today wines labeled Collioure AOC must contain at least a 60% blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre with no individual grape variety permitted to exceed 90% of the total blend. Cinsault and Carignan and allowed to up to a maximum of 30%. Prior to the 2002 AOC change, white wines produced from grapes grown in the Collioure region had to be sold as a vin de Pays. Today the AOC white blend must contain a minimum of 70% blend of Grenache blanc and Grenache gris with Macabeo, Malvoisie, Marsanne, Roussanne and Vermentino permitted to round out the remaining portion of the blend - though each of those grape varieties can not individually exceed 15%.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 237 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Over the years, the quality of wines produced in the Collioure AOC has been steadily increasing. Wine experts, such as Andre Domine point to the 1982 enc√©pagement change that permitted the use of Syrah and Mourvedre as a turning point. Modern winemaking techniques have also introduced temperature controlled fermentation as well as increased usage of oak barrels for the aging of wine. The most well made reds of Collioure are described as having polished (or \\"soft\\") tannins, a full bodied and deep dark color with spicy aroma and flavor notes. The roses of the region can be very aromatic and usually have a raspberry color. They are traditionally paired with the local seafood. The whites can have a golden color and be very full bodied. They are usually consumed within 3 years of harvest.

T. Wu James Gareth Endicott (1898-1993) was a Canadian clergyman, Christian missionary, and socialist.  Family and early life  Endicott was born in Szechuan Province, China, the third of five children to a Methodist missionary family and became fluent in Chinese. His family returned to Canada in 1910. His father, James Endicott, was elected the second Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 1926 to 1928. Endicott enlisted in World War I as a Private. After the war he was educated at the University of Toronto's Victoria College where he was president of the student council and a founder of the university's Student Christian Movement. Endicott earned a master's degree and was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Canada. In 1925, Endicott returned to China as a missionary remaining there for most of the following two decades. Missionary in China While Endicott was a missionary in China, he taught English in China and became professor of English and Ethics at West China Union University. He became social advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and political advisor to his New Life Movement and served as an advisor to US military intelligence from 1944 to 1945 as a liaison between the American military and the Chinese Communist forces fighting against the Japanese in World War II. Initially a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, he once compared Chiang to Abraham Lincoln and described Madame Chiang as a combination of Helen of Troy, Florence Nightingale and Joan of Arc. He became disillusioned after seeing Chiang's officers starve their troops and by the Kuomintang's corruption. Endicott was impressed by the Communists and became friends with Zhou Enlai as the Chinese Civil War resumed, and he became a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party. During the war he provided an underground network where pro-communist forces could meet and exchange ideas.\\"Famed missionary James Endicott\\", by Leslie Ferenc, Toronto Star, November 29, 1993 After the war, he spoke at student demonstrations, urging opposition to the Nationalist government and provoking criticism from the church in Canada. This led to his resignation from the ministry and the mission on May 5, 1946 after the United Church of Canada gave him an ultimatum to either modify his public statements or quit. In August 1946 Endicott was invited to help write a constitution for the new League for the Protection of Human Rights in China. Paul Yen, Talitha Gerlach, Y. T. Wu and other liberals were also asked to participate. At Zhou En-lai's urging, he moved to Shanghai to publish the underground anti-Kuomintang Shanghai Newsletter. The newsletter was aimed at westerners in the Kuomintang stronghold as well as at trying to convince western governments that Chiang's regime was corrupt and dictatorial. Return to Canada In 1947, he returned to Canada. At a time when western countries were backing Chiang and were optimistic about his government, Endicott advised the Canadian government that the Kuomintang regime's fall was imminent and then went public with his predictions and his denunciation of the Kuomintang as corrupt. His comments were denounced as traitorous by the media and he was labelled the most reviled Canadian of the year for his support of the Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China and was criticized by the United Church for his support of the revolution. He continued his support for the Chinese Communist Party by giving lectures and publishing the Canadian Far Eastern Weekly which had 5,000 subscribers at its peak.  Canadian Peace Congress  In 1949, he founded and became chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress and helped publish its Peace Letter bulletin. He also became a senior figure in the World Peace Council serving as president of the International Institute for Peace from 1957 until 1971. In 1950, as a Canadian delegate to the World Peace Council in Stockholm, Endicott sat on the committee that drafted the Stockholm Peace Appeal which was the petition that began the international \\"Ban the Bomb\\" movement.\\"PROFILE: To the church, James Endicott was a China missionary, to the RCMP he was a security threat. At 91, he's still a vociferous fighter for peace - and he says capitalism won't produce it - A Marxist revolutionary marches on\\" by Coleman Romalis, Globe and Mail, July 16, 1990 Korean War Endicott returned on a visit to China in 1952, during the Korean War and, on his return to Canada, charged the United States with using chemical and biological weapons during the war. His charges led him to be vilified in the Canadian press as \\"public enemy number one\\" and he was censured by the United Church for his support of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists.\\"OBITUARY: James Gareth Endicott Chinese-born missionary was peace activist\\", by Donn Downey, Globe and Mail, November 29, 1993 He was condemned by Canadian politicians, including Lester Pearson who had been a college friend. Pearson called him the \\"bait on the end of a Red hook\\" and a \\"Red stooge\\" while John George Diefenbaker called his statements \\"damnable,\\" and Conservative leader George Drew referred to Endicott as a \\"jackal of the Communists.\\" The government threatened to charge him with treason and sedition, but did not follow through, while others called for him to lose his passport and mailing privileges.\\"Vilified in 1950s, Endicott receives church's apology\\", Globe and Mail, August 13, 1982  Later work  Endicott was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1952 for his efforts working for \\"peaceful coexistence between the Christians and the Communists.\\" He continued his advocacy for the People's Republic of China by publishing the Canadian Far East Newsletter and though he publicly backed the Soviet Union in the initial years of the Sino-Soviet split he was sympathetic to China's arguments and reported them in the newsletter. Endicott was offered the presidency of the World Peace Council in the early 1960s but declined due to his wife's declining health and what he anticipated as a personally untenable position of leading the council during a period of growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their respective factions on the council. In 1982, the United Church extended a formal apology to Endicott for having denounced him three decades earlier, acknowledging that it had caused him \\"much personal hurt and anxiety.\\" Tiananmen Square and later views on China In an interview shortly before his death, Endicott said that he thought the Communist Manifesto is \\"still as true as ever,\\" though he feels the \\"old men\\" who are Communist leaders like Deng Xiaoping are not progressive enough.. Though ambivalent about the policies of Deng and initially sympathetic to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Endicott believed the Chinese government's version of events. He told an interviewer, > What is more clear to me now is that there was a core of students who were > concerned mainly with getting something done about corruption in the party > and in the society. I said at the time they should be supported. But a lot > of the leaders, who at the time appeared to be idealistic, turned out to be > agents for a capitalist restoration. It appears now that the Communist > government was relatively correct in saying that very few people were killed > in Tiananmen ‚Äì perhaps two or three hundred, at most. But in another western > section of Beijing, a lot of people were killed. There was practically a > shoot-out between the capitalist roaders and the socialists ‚Äì if you can > call the army socialists. Arguing that there was an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, Endicott stated, > What took place was a minor civil war. The army's action in upholding the > constitution probably prevented the capitalist roaders from really making an > attempt to take over by military force. What was the government to do? Not > react? Relationship with Canadian Communists In 1971, William Kashtan, general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada asked him to resign from the Canadian Peace Congress and as Canada's delegate to the World Council of Peace accusing the Canadian Far East Newsletter of being anti-Soviet and pro-Mao. Endicott agreed to leave the organization rather than stop publication of the newsletter or withdraw his support for China in its conflict with the Soviet Union. He founded the Canada-China Society shortly after leaving the Canadian Peace Congress and publicly broke with the Soviet Union. Though friendly with Tim Buck, Stanley Ryerson, Leslie Morris and other Canadian Communists, Endicott never joined the Communist Party of Canada though three of his children joined its legal front, the Labor-Progressive Party. He had joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation while living in Toronto on sabbatical from 1941 to 1944, and campaigned for the party in the 1942 federal by- election in which Joseph Noseworthy won an upset victory, but his membership lapsed when he returned to China. When he applied to rejoin the CCF in 1948 his membership application was rejected; no reason was given but it is almost certain it was rejected due to Endicott's perceived association with Communism.

The film stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid. Since its release, Christmas Vacation has often been labeled as a modern Christmas classic. It is the only sequel in the franchise to have its own direct sequel: a 2003 made-for-TV release titled National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure. Christmas Vacation is the last theatrical Vacation film to carry the National Lampoon label and to feature a screenwriting credit from Hughes. Plot In December 1989, Chicago resident Clark Griswold plans to have a great Christmas with his entire family. He gathers his wife Ellen, daughter Audrey, and son Rusty and drives out to the country to a tree farm. After walking through the snow for hours, Clark finds the largest tree he can. Realizing too late that they did not bring any tools to cut the tree down, they are forced to uproot it instead, before driving home with the tree strapped to the roof of their car. Soon after, both Clark's and Ellen's parents arrive to spend Christmas, but their bickering quickly begins to annoy the family. Clark, however, maintains a positive attitude, determined to have a \\"fun old-fashioned family Christmas.\\" He covers the house's entire exterior with 25,000 twinkle lights, which fail to work at first, as he has accidentally wired them through his garage's light switch. When they finally come on, they temporarily cause a citywide power shortage and create chaos for Clark's yuppie neighbors, Todd and Margo. While standing on the front lawn admiring the lights, Clark is shocked to see Ellen's redneck cousin Catherine and her husband Eddie, as they arrive unannounced with their children, Rocky and Ruby Sue, and their Rottweiler dog, Snots. Eddie later admits that they are living in the RV they arrived in, as he is broke and has been forced to sell his home and acreage. Clark offers to buy gifts for Eddie's kids so they can still enjoy Christmas. Soon afterward, Clark‚Äôs Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis arrive as well. Clark begins to wonder why his boss Frank Shirley has not given him his yearly bonus, which he desperately needs to replace an advance payment he has made to install a swimming pool for the coming summer. After a disastrous Christmas Eve dinner, along with Bethany's cat getting electrocuted and Uncle Lewis accidentally burning down the Christmas tree, he finally receives an envelope from a company messenger, who had failed to deliver it the day before. Instead of the presumed bonus, the envelope contains a free year's membership for the \\"Jelly of the Month Club\\". This prompts Clark to snap and go into a tirade about Frank, and out of anger, requests that he be delivered to the house, wrapped in a bow, so Clark can insult him to his face. Eddie takes the request literally, drives to Frank's mansion, and kidnaps him. Frank admits to have cancelled the Christmas bonuses, and Clark chastises him for it. Meanwhile, Frank's wife, Helen, calls the police, and a SWAT team storms the Griswold house and holds everyone at gunpoint. Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the SWAT leader, who scold him for his decision to scrap the bonuses, and he decides to reinstate them (with Clark getting a bonus equal to last year's amount, plus 20% as compensation). The family heads outside when Rocky and Ruby Sue believe they see Santa Claus in the distance. Clark tells them it is actually the Christmas Star and that he finally realizes what the holiday means to him. Uncle Lewis says the light is coming from the sewage treatment plant; reminding Clark that Eddie had been dumping his sewage into the nearby storm drain. Before Clark can stop him, Uncle Lewis tosses a match used to light his cigar into the drain, triggering an explosion. The explosion sends a Santa's sleigh decoration flying into the sky. Aunt Bethany starts singing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and everyone joins in as the flaming decoration flies into the distance. The entire family and the SWAT team members then celebrate inside the house, while Clark and Ellen happily share a Christmas kiss, and Clark stands outside satisfied that he has the Christmas that he always wanted.

Hughes eventually gave Columbus the script to Home Alone. =Filming= Principal photography began on March 27, 1989 in Summit County, Colorado, with footage shot in Silverthorne, Breckenridge, and Frisco. From there the production moved to Warner Bros. Ranch Facilities in Burbank, California, where the set of the Griswold family's house and street is located. Music The musical score for National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was composed by Angelo Badalamenti. It is the only installment of the Vacation film series not to include Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Holiday Road\\". In its place is a song entitled \\"Christmas Vacation\\" that was written for the movie by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and performed by Mavis Staples of The Staple Singers fame. The song was covered in 2007 by High School Musical star Monique Coleman for the 2007 Christmas album Disney Channel Holiday. Popular Christmas songs featured in the film include Bing Crosby's Hawaiian-themed \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\", and, during the climax of the film, Gene Autry's \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\". For the latter song, Autry's re-recorded 1957 Challenge Records version is used. Despite several popular songs being present in the film, no official soundtrack album was released. In 1999, a bootleg copy containing music featured in the film along with select cuts of dialogue dubbed as the \\"10th Anniversary Limited Edition\\" began to appear on Internet auction sites with the claim that Warner Bros. and RedDotNet had pressed 20,000 CDs for Six Flags Magic Mountain employees to sell to customers entering the park. However, while the discs were individually numbered out of 20,000, only 7,000 were sold as a part of an on demand production printed at gift shop kiosks within the park. Forums on movie music sites such as SoundtrackCollector later declared the disc to be a bootleg due to its inaccuracies. For instance, the cut \\"Christmas Vacation Medley\\" (claiming to be the work of composer Angelo Badalamenti) is really a track called \\"Christmas at Carnegie Hall\\" from Home Alone 2: Lost in New York by composer John Williams and does not actually contain any of Badalamenti's Christmas Vacation score. Release =Home media= The film has been released on home media seven different times: VHS and Laserdisc in early 1990, a bare bones DVD in 1997, and a \\"Special Edition\\" DVD in 2003. HD DVD as well as Blu- ray editions were released in 2006. In 2009, a second Blu-ray of the film was released as an \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition.\\" At the same time of this release, it was also released on a simple Blu-ray/DVD combo. A steelbook Blu- ray was released in 2015. Reception =Box office= The movie debuted at #2 at the box-office while grossing $11,750,203 during the opening weekend, behind Back to the Future Part II. The movie eventually topped the box-office charts in its third week of release and remained #1 the following weekend. It went on to gross a total of $71,319,546 in the United States while showing in movie theaters. It was the highest-grossing film in the series, until the release of Vacation in 2015. =Critical response= At the time of the film's release, the film received mixed to positive reviews; however, over time, many have cited it as a Christmas classic. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67% of 46 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.27 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \\"While Christmas Vacation may not be the most disciplined comedy, it's got enough laughs and good cheer to make for a solid seasonal treat.\\" Entertainment magazine Variety responded positively to the film stating, \\"Solid family fare with plenty of yucks, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is Chevy Chase and brood doing what they do best. Despite the title, which links it to previous pics in the rambling Vacation series, this third entry is firmly rooted at the Griswold family homestead, where Clark Griswold (Chase) is engaged in a typical over-reaching attempt to give his family a perfect, old-fashioned Christmas.\\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review explaining that \\"it will prove pater-familiar to fans of the 1983 original and the European Vacation sequel. Only it's a bit more whimsical.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two out of four stars, saying, \\"The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work.\\" See also * List of National Lampoon films * List of theatrical Christmas films References External links  Category:1989 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1980s buddy films Category:1980s Christmas comedy films Category:American buddy films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American sequel films Category:Films about vacationing Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Colorado Category:National Lampoon's Vacation (film series) Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films scored by Angelo Badalamenti Category:Films produced by John Hughes (filmmaker) Category:Films with screenplays by John Hughes (filmmaker) Category:Films directed by Jeremiah S.

Maury is vinified in a manner similar to port, but initial aging is often conducted in large 25 liter (6.6 US gallon/5.5 imperial gallon) glass jugs known as bonbonnes, les dames jeannes or demi-johns. The wines may also be aged in wood for up to 15 years. The resulting wines vary in depth and concentration.Jancis Robinson: Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pgs 85, 431, 466 & 738-739 Oxford University Press 2006 In food and wine pairings, Maury is often served as an ap√©ritif or as an accompaniment to foie gras, duck and strong blue cheeses. For dessert, aged Maury, much like Banyuls, is recognized as a suitable pairing for chocolate. History In 1299, the Catalan physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova received a patent for perfecting the technique of halting the fermentation of wine by adding grape spirits. This technique is still used today to make the wines of Maury. Viticulture was likely first introduced to the area by the Ancient Greeks who settled the coast of southern France in 600 BC. Wines from the area were well known by the time of the Romans. Much of Maury's history is influenced by its location as part of the Roussillon region which was part of the Kingdom of Majorca (and later Crown of Aragon) until 1642, when a revolt against the Spanish crown brought French forces into the region. The 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees officially brought the area under the French crown. However, to this day the mix of Spanish and French influence can be seen in the winemaking style of Maury, which utilizes Spanish grape varieties such a Garnacha/Grenache as well as French Syrah. The style of winemaking that would become associated with Maury has its roots in the work of the Catalan alchemist and physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. He perfected the technique of stopping fermentation with distilled alcohol in the late 13th centuryChris Kissack \\"Roussillon Wine Guide: Muscat, Maury and more\\" The Wine Doctor. Accessed: March 23rd, 2013 and was given an exclusive patent on the process by King James II of Majorca. In 1872, Roussillo politician Fran√ßois Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of vin doux naturels as wines which had residual sugar and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with grape spirits. In 1936, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC. Climate and geography Ch√¢teau de Qu√©ribus overlooking the Maury AOC. As part of the Roussillon region the climate of Maury is warm, dry and very Mediterranean influenced. The nearby town of Perpignan is one of the sunniest places in all of France with an average annal temperature of . However Maury's location northwest of Perpignan, in the hilly hinterlands of the Agly valley, does temper some of the Mediterranean influence with westward winds from the Atlantic, bringing a slightly cooler influence to the valley. Similar to the Mistral influence in the Rh√¥ne, the dry northward wind Tramontane serves to cool the grapes but is much more gentle and less frequent than the powerful Mistral that can damage the vines. In the shadow of the remains of the Cathar stronghold Ch√¢teau de Qu√©ribus, the soils of Maury are mix of schist and slate. Closer to the communes of Lesquerde the soil includes more granite, while near the town of Tautavel in the east the soil contains high portions of the argilo-calcaire vineyard soils of clay and limestone. Winemaking A vineyard in the commune of Tautavel that can provide grapes for Maury wine. As a vin doux naturel (or VdN) Maury wines undergo a unique form of winemaking that shares elements with other notable fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and vin de liqueur. An English translation of the name would be \\"wines naturally sweet\\" and refers to the natural residual sugars of the grapes that are left unfermented in the wine. However these sugars are left because of the outside addition of grape spirits (or brandy) added early in the fermentation period that kills the yeast and halts the fermentation process. This process, called mutage leaves a partially fermented must (called the vin mut√©) with 6 to 12% alcohol from the fermentation and 5-10% alcohol by volume from the brandy. The amount of residual sugar left in the wine will vary from 50 to 125 g/l (5 to 12.5% RS). Prior to fermentation, the grapes destined for Maury production (predominantly Grenache) are harvested very ripe usually with a potential alcohol level (based on the amount of grape sugar alone) at 14.5% (around 25 to 27¬∞Bx or 13.8 to 15 Baum√©). After crushing, the must usually undergoes a period of extended maceration that can last up to 30 days. During this time the cap of grapes skins is frequently punched down (pigeage) or the juice pulled out from under the tank and pumped over the cap to allow for a more thorough extraction of phenolics that influence tannin, colour and aroma. Usually during this maceration, the fermentation process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar. Often the wine will have fermented to the point where the grape spirits are added before maceration has ended and the wine is pressed off the skins, a process known as mutage sur grains. The added alcohol during maceration allows for more ethanol-soluble phenolics and flavor compounds to be extracted. After pressing, the wine is left to settle in concrete vats over the winter before it is racked into barrels or other containers. Maury wines are often fermented and settled in large concrete fermentors such as these. The large opening allows cellar works to punch down the cap during maceration. Since the fermentation process is halted rather quickly, the flavors of Maury do retain some of the natural primary grape aromas of Grenache along with some of the early fermentation esters that develop. But most of the distinctive character of Maury come from the aging process that can take place in a wide range of containers (from concrete and oak barrels to glass bonbonnes) kept in a variety of conditions (including out in the sun for deliberate oxidation) for a number of years depending the particular house style of the winemaker. = Rancio = One style of Maury known as rancio is produced when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or bonbonne and left out in the summer sun to oxidize and age. This causes many of the colour compounds and tannins in the wines to fall out, leaving a thick, dark coloured deposit in the bonbonne. This deposit is allowed to stay in the bonbonne to influence the colour and flavour of resulting vintages of wine that are aged in the container. Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large foudres oak cask or sold separately as Maury Rancio. = Comparison to Port = A bottle of Maury wine \\"vintage dated\\" with 1948. This date may not necessarily be the year that the grapes were harvested but rather the year that the wine was bottled. While the Portuguese wine Port is similarly made with a mutage halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine. =Vintage dating= While vintage Maurys do exist, most wines are a blend of several vintages with some producers even utilizing a solera system of fractional blending similar to Sherry. These wines will often have an estimate age of \\"bottle date\\" listed on the wine label instead of a vintage. Since 1975, more producers have experimented with \\"vintage\\" Maurys (called Rimage in neighboring Banyuls). These are wines that are bottled early, often without rancio or barrel aging. The wines have a very dark red color with strong cherry and ripe flavors with noticeable tannins.  AOC regulations  All Maury AOC wines made since 2000 must contain at least 75% Grenache. When Maury was first granted its AOC, the minimum Grenache percentage required was only 50%, but that figure has risen steadily over the years and today Maury wines must be made from at least 75% Grenache noir with pre-2000 vintages grandfathered to require minimum of 70%. In reality, most Maury are 90-100% Grenache though other varieties are permitted to be used. These include Macabeo, which is limited to constituting no more than 10% of the blend (15% maximum for pre-2000 vintages), and Carignan, Cinsault, Listan Negra and Syrah which collectively can not make up more than 10% of the blend. Other white grape varieties beyond Macabeo are also permitted including Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Tourbat, Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria. Grapes destined for AOC wine production in Maury are limited to a harvest yield no greater than 30 hectoliters/hectares (approximately 1.6 tons/acre). When the fortified spirits is added is not specifically regulated but the finished wine must have a minimum alcohol level of at least 15%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 83 Firefly Books 2004 Non-fortified table wines produced in the southern reaches of Maury AOC along the Agly valley have been previously eligible for the C√¥tes du Roussillon-Villages AOC or to be sold as a vin de pays under the Vin de Pays des C√¥tes Catalanes designation. For the 2011 vintage, a new AOC designation of Maury Sec was introduced to allow for dry table wines produced from the same grape varieties permitted for the vin doux naturel.Wines of Roussillon \\"2012 Press Kit \\" pg 33 May 2012 Production and industry In 1998, Maury had of planted vineyard producing 48,086 hectoliters (over 534,000 cases) of wine. By 2003, these numbers had not changed.O. Clarke Oz Clarke's Encyclopedia of Wine pg 241 Time Warner Books, London 2003 Like most of Roussillon, the wine industry of Maury is dominated by co-operatives with Les Vignerons du Maury making the bulk of the yearly production. In recent years, smaller estates experimenting with new winemaking and aging techniques have garnered the attentions of wine writers and critics. These include Mas Amiel and Domaine de la Pr√©ceptorie.  Wine styles  A bottle of Maury wine from the estate Maury Dor√©. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the wines of Maury are often very tannic in their youth, requiring long barrel aging before they are bottled. Compared to neighboring Banyuls, the vin doux naturels of Maury are often noticeably darker in colour. Wine writer Tom Stevenson notes that Maury wines can come in tawny and ros√© styles as well as red and are often characterized by toasty, nutty flavours with raisin and tangy berry fruit. Master of Wine Clive Coates describes the wines having rich flavours of chocolate, black cherries and mocha with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Younger examples will have a fresh raspberry flavour typical of Grenache. In regards to food and wine pairing, Coates notes that Maury are one of the rare wines that pair well with chocolate desserts. Coates also states that similar to Banyuls, Maury wines are often ready to drink soon after they're bottled and do not benefit much from any further aging in the cellar. When opened, the high alcohol content can protect the wine from the effects of oxidation but most of the fruit flavors will leave if the wine is not consumed within a week. Wine expert Andre Domin√© notes that the flavour of Maury will depend on how long it has been aged prior to bottling with the youngest \\"first phase\\" Maury wines having candied cherries, fresh figs and stewed fruit aromas while \\"second phase\\" wines will develop more dried fruits flavours of raisins, prunes and apricots. Longer aging, seven years or more, will give the wine caramel, cocoa, tobacco and coffee notes while rancio style will have green walnut husk and aromas similar to cognacs and vin jaune wines from the Jura.

The Spirit played in the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball (the \\"Can-Am League,\\" also known as the Northeast League), an independent league that is not affiliated with Major League Baseball or with the Minor League Baseball organization. The team was originally known as the Waterbury Spirit, based out of Waterbury, Connecticut. The Spirit were owned by Nicholas Lopardo throughout their five-year history in Lynn. Team history =Waterbury Spirit= Waterbury Spirit Logo The Waterbury Spirit began play in 1997 in the Northeast League. During the team's four-year stint in Connecticut, they made the playoffs three times, losing in the first round all three times. The team folded following the 2000 season. Originally, the team was to be known as the \\"Waterbury Wizards\\" but a potential lawsuit with the Fort Wayne Wizards prompted the team to seek alternate names. =Reborn in the North Shore= Lopardo acquired the team in 2002 when he purchased the inactive franchise. After the formation of the team was announced in August 2002, Lopardo funded a massive, expensive renovation of Fraser Field. $2 million was put into improvements in seating, comfort, and technology of the field, including the installation of FieldTurf in the infield. In their first season, 2003, 90,000 people attended Spirit games, a record for pro baseball at Fraser Field. In the 2003 season, the Spirit won the first-half North Division championship and defeated the Quebec Capitales in the first round of the playoffs, 3 games to 0, then were swept by the Brockton Rox, 3 games to 0, in the league championship series, giving Brockton the Northeast League title. Another highlight of the 2003 season was a game against the New Jersey Jackals in which the Spirit set over 15 Northeast League records by scoring 14 runs in one inning. On the field, the team featured two players who were signed by Major League Baseball organizations: outfielder Carlos Sepulveda, by the Florida Marlins and second baseman Marcos Agramonte, by the San Diego Padres. Also in that year the team held a ceremony honoring legendary North Shore baseball player Tony Conigliaro and retiring his number 25. Spirit Secondary Logo In 2004 the Spirit played host to 120,000 fans, breaking the record they had set the year before, and ranking 3rd in league attendance behind the Brockton Rox and Quebec Capitales. They once again won the first-half North Division Championship, in record fashion, shattering the league record for first half winning percentage with 35 wins in the 46 game half. The Spirit also once again defeated the Quebec Capitales in the first round of the playoffs, 3 games to 2. However, just as in 2003, the Spirit fell in the league championship series, this time to the New Jersey Jackals. The Spirit won the first two games of the series at Yogi Berra Stadium, but dropped the three games at Fraser Field (two after blowing late inning leads and losing in extra innings). In 2004 the Spirit honored another local baseball legend, Johnny Pesky, affectionately known as \\"Mr. Red Sox.\\" The team featured two more players who would be picked up by Major League Organizations, this time, two pitchers: John Kelly and Jeremy Sugarman, who were signed by the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, respectively. 2005 was the first year that the Spirit failed to make the playoffs, but nonetheless they had a good season, finishing with the 2nd best record in the league behind Quebec and drawing over 100,000 fans to Fraser Field for the second consecutive season. On September 3, 2005, the last home game of the season, owner Nick Lopardo responded to rumors of the franchise's demise with an emphatic assurance that the Spirit would be back for their fourth season at Fraser Field. Can-Am League and North Shore Spirit history was made in April 2006 as ex-Spirit player Ken Ray made his Major League Baseball debut for the Atlanta Braves, striking out Barry Bonds as part of a 1-2-3 inning against the San Francisco Giants. Ray became a mainstay in the Atlanta bullpen that season and even served as the team's closer for a time. He remains the only Can-Am league alum to be playing in the Majors. On July 12, 2006, the Spirit won their third first-half championship in franchise history, qualifying for the 2006 Can-Am League Playoffs. They went on to have the most successful regular season in Can-Am League history. In the 2006 playoffs, the Spirit were defeated in the first round by the Quebec Capitales, 3-2, splitting the first two games at Fraser Field and then losing two out of three in Quebec City. Rumors were rampant in late 2006 that the Spirit would leave Lynn, but in November the team confirmed that it would return for a fifth season at Fraser Field, set to begin on May 25, 2007. In September, 2007, after the 2007 Can-Am playoffs, Nick Lopardo announced that he would cease operations.http://www.itemlive.com/articles/2007/09/07/news/news01.txt Their final game was a 6-4 home loss against the Nashua Pride in the third game of the Can-Am League Championship Series.

The 12-inch EP originally featured with six tracks, then, a year later in 1985, it was released on cassette with five additional songs that lengthened the release to a full album. This expansion became the default version of Remission. Remission was certified gold by Music Canada on January 31, 2000. Release history In December 1984, Remission was distributed through Nettwerk as Skinny Puppy's first major release. Despite being preceded by the embryonic Back & Forth EP that was limited to just 35 home-printed copies, Remission is seen as the band's debut effort. To complicate the matter further, most issues of the EP following its release year, 1984, were expanded with five additional tracks, retroactively turning it into a full-blown studio album. In 1993, Nettwerk released Remission on CD using the expanded track listing from the 1985 cassette release. However, this wasn't the first time Remission appeared in the format; the EP's first CD release was in 1987, when it (along with the appended track \\"Glass Out\\") was combined with Skinny Puppy's 1985 album Bites to form the release Bites and Remission (a compilation distinct from the less popular Remission & Bites, which was also released in 1987 and also on Nettwerk, but that preserved the original track sequence of Remission and the European sequence of Bites). On May 17, 2018, cEvin Key released \\"Coma\\", an instrumental track created during the Remission era, through his YouTube channel. Background and composition Both Remission and Skinny Puppy's follow-up album Bites were created before Dwayne Goettel joined in 1986 and helped crystallize the band's hard, percussion-driven industrial sound. As such, Remission features more synthpop and electro elements than Skinny Puppy would come to be known for. It is the first known commercial release to use a TR-909 drum machine. In 2013, Skinny Puppy's 12th album (4th since being reunited without the presence of Goettel), Weapon, was released as a sort of spiritual successor to both Remission and Bites. Apart from containing a re- recorded version of \\"Solvent\\" from Remission, Weapon was deliberately created with antiquated instruments to achieve their early 80s electronic sound. Critical reception Contemporary reception of Remission was mostly positive. The AllMusic review wrote that the EP \\"remains the Puppy's finest hour. The breadth of vision and amazing instrumental prowess of vocalist Nivek Ogre and sound-designer cEvin Key will likely never be transcended.\\" Retrospectively, Remission gained more praise, being cited as an important influence to many bands. In an article about Skinny Puppy's broad influence, Alec Chillingworth of Metal Hammer wrote, \\"Al Jourgensen‚Äôs Ministry was laughable in ‚Äô84, whereas Puppy gave us Remission: an EP bursting with potential, exuding a dance-ready racket heavier than anything their contemporaries offered.\\" Fact placed Remission at number 19 on their list of 20 best industrial and EBM albums of all time, calling it \\"excellent electro- pop\\".

Formed in early 1942, within a short time Gwardia Ludowa became the largest clandestine fighting force on Polish soil which refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State loyal to the London-based government-in-exile. In the January 1 of 1944 GL was incorporated into the communist Armia Ludowa. Gwardia Ludowa was created on 6 January 1942 with military aid from the Red Army. The availability of firearms led to GL swiftly reaching a strength of 3,000 fighters. Gwardia Ludowa was connected to the NKVD intelligence services of the Soviet Union with NKVD colonels commanding some AL military actions. It was tasked with fighting against Germany by means of partisan warfare, sabotage, and reprisal actions. The full size partisan detachments were formed in May 1942 although foray groups were organized earlier. They operated near Piotrk√≥w and Radom. By the end of the year the organisation was divided onto seven administrative districts including Warsaw, Lublin, Radom-Kielce, Krak√≥w, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Silesia and Lw√≥w. Partisan actions First major operations of GL consisted of disassembling train tracks. Until December 1942 some 50 railway lines were damaged resulting in 30 German supply trains being disabled.Waldemar Tuszy≈Ñski, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, KAW 1985, p. 51. . .

The most prominent sabotage action took place on 16 November 1942 along the railway line Radom ‚Äì ≈Åuk√≥w ‚Äì Terespol, where five trains and a bridge were destroyed with the use of Soviet explosives.Tuszy≈Ñski 1985, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, p. 51. Another five trains were derailed around O≈õwiƒôcim on 25 February 1943. Throughout the year, trains were damaged around Warsaw in Olszynka Grochowska, Elsner√≥w, Legionowo, ≈ªyrard√≥w and ≈ªywczyn.Tuszy≈Ñski 1985, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, p. 52. In total, Gwardia Ludowa caused damage to 169 trains in 1943, as well as 113 train stations, resulting in 55 temporary line shut-downs.Tuszy≈Ñski 1985, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, p. 53. GL retaliation actions included throwing grenades into buildings frequented by the Germans. The Apollo movie theatre in Radom was attacked on 22 November 1942; the Deutsches Haus in April 1943. In Krak√≥w and Kielce the Nur f√ºr Deutsche coffee houses were bombed in December 1942 and February 1943 respectively.Tuszy≈Ñski 1985, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, p. 55. The German administration building in Rzesz√≥w was bombed also in February. Most of GL operations resulted in great number of Polish and Jewish hostages being shot by the Germans in reprisal.Tuszy≈Ñski 1985, Ruch oporu w Polsce 1939‚Äì1943, p. 56. =Field organization= GL was divided into partisan units and garrison units assembled for quick ambushes, after which the garrison members returned to their homes. By the end of 1942 GL had approximately 5,000 men, including, at least nominally, every member of the Polish Workers' Party. By late 1943 the number rose to about 10,000. Among them approximately 1,700 were partisans, and the rest were part-time combatants. For the most part, the GL carried out acts of sabotage, including the sabotage of German rail transport. =Zamo≈õƒá Uprising= GL took part in the Zamo≈õƒá uprising - a series of partisan actions against the forced Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany from the Zamo≈õƒá region. =Warsaw Ghetto Uprising= Since the formation of GL, its soldiers worked together with Jewish partisans.Nechama Tec Resistance: Jews and Christians Who Defied the Nazi Terror.

Commanders The prominent commanders and GL chiefs of staff were Marian Spychalski, Franciszek J√≥≈∫wiak, Franciszek Zubrzycki, and Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar who played a prominent role in the history of the Polish People's Republic after the war's end; known for his ultra-nationalist and xenophobic attitude. Controversies Gwardia Ludowa (GL) was commanded by the head of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR). The first commander was Boles≈Çaw Mo≈Çojec. After his execution at the end of 1942 by his own communist peers from the Polish Workers' Party, he was succeeded by Franciszek J√≥≈∫wiak. However, because of the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland in 1939‚Äì41, the Polish underground resistance never fully developed in the territories around the prewar Lw√≥w Voivodeship area. In 1943, the command of partisan movement in General Government was passed to the Soviet partisans by Moscow. The Gwardia Ludowa military wing of PPR (with which Parczew partisans aligned themselves, for the weapons), engaged in robberies and terror expeditions aimed at local domination over the competing political structures. On one occasion, the unit of Gwardia Ludowa commanded by Grzegorz Korczy≈Ñski from Kra≈õnik County near Lublin, committed mass atrocities in the village of Ludmi≈Ç√≥wka on 6 December 1942 killing dozens of Jews in retaliation for the PPR action in Grab√≥wka against their own men.

The red car's driver picks a tree to judge a two-second safety buffer. The two-second rule is a rule of thumb by which a driver may maintain a safe trailing distance at any speed. The rule is that a driver should ideally stay at least two seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front of his or her vehicle. It is intended for automobiles, although its general principle applies to other types of vehicles. Some areas recommend a three- second rule instead of a two-second rule to give an additional buffer. The two seconds is not a guide to safe stopping distance, it is more a guide to reaction times. The two-second rule is useful as it can be applied to any speed. Drivers can find it difficult to estimate the correct distance from the car in front, let alone remember the stopping distances that are required for a given speed, or to compute the equation on the fly (BD = (SMPH/20)*SMPH). The two-second rule gets around these problems and provides a simple and common-sense way of improving road safety. The practice has been shown to considerably reduce the risk of collision and also the severity of any injuries if a collision occurs. It also helps to avoid tailgating and road rage for all drivers. A large risk of tailgating is the collision avoidance time being much less than the driver reaction time. Driving instructors advocate that drivers always use the \\"two-second rule\\" regardless of speed or the type of road. During adverse weather, downhill slopes, or hazardous conditions such as black ice, it is important to maintain an even greater distance. The two-second rule tells a defensive driver the minimum distance needed to reduce the risk of collision under ideal driving conditions. The allotted two-seconds is a safety buffer, to allow the following driver time to respond. To estimate the time, a driver can wait until the rear end of the vehicle in front passes any distinct and fixed point on the roadway‚Äîe.g. a road sign, mailbox, line/crack/patch in the road. After the car ahead passes a given fixed point, the front of one's car should pass the same point no less than two seconds later. If the elapsed time is less than this, one should increase the distance, then repeat the method again until the time is at least two seconds. One can count the duration of time simply by saying \\"zero... one... two\\" but for greater accuracy, it is suggested that drivers say \\"only a fool breaks the two-second rule\\". At a normal speaking rate, this sentence takes approximately two seconds to say and serves as a reminder to the driver of the importance of the rule itself. The TailGuardian distance advisory decals recently adopted by Stagecoach Buses in the UK use the two-second rule in their calibration. Advisory Decals for 30, 50 and 70 mph are calibrated to be invisible outside those safe distance, only rendering themselves visible once the car following has entered the safety zone for the speed that they are travelling. Some authorities regard two seconds as inadequate, and recommend a three-second rule.The 3-second rule Smartmotorist.com German law requires a minimum 0.9 second distance but when tested under relaxed conditionsDistance behaviour on motorways Darmstadt University of Technology researchers found that their test subjects spent 41% of the test time at following distances under 0.9 second. The United States National Safety Council suggests that a three-second rule‚Äîwith increases of one second per factor of driving difficulty‚Äîis more appropriate. Factors that make driving more difficult include poor lighting conditions (dawn and dusk are the most common); inclement weather (ice, rain, snow, fog, etc.), adverse traffic mix (heavy vehicles, slow vehicles, impaired drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.), and personal condition (fatigue, sleepiness, drug-related loss of response time, distracting thoughts, etc.). For example, a fatigued driver piloting a car in rainy weather at dusk would do well to observe a six-second following distance, rather than the basic three-second gap.Factors influencing stopping distances See also * Assured Clear Distance Ahead (ACDA) * Braking distance * Stopping sight distance * Tailgating References External links * Tutorial: Keep Your Distance‚ÄîTraveling Safely behind other traffic, by Driving School Ireland * Illinois Rules of the Road‚ÄîSee Chapter 11 \\"Safe Driving Tips\\" for details on the \\"three-second rule\\" * How to practice following distance rules * Passive advisory decals to following traffic Category:Road safety Category:Rules of thumb fr:Distance de perception- r√©action ","title":"Two-second rule"},{"id":"1125338","text":"400px Area code 561 is the telephone area code in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It was created on May 13, 1996, in a split from area code 407. Notable cities within 561 are Palm Beach, West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Wellington, Boynton Beach, Jupiter, Delray Beach, and Belle Glade. The creation of 561 was intended as a long-term solution. However, within only five years, 561 was close to exhaustion once again due to rapid growth in the Palm Beaches/Treasure Coast region and the proliferation of cell phones. The supply of numbers was further limited because all of South Florida from the Treasure Coast to the Florida Keys is a single LATA, meaning numbers in Miami's 305/786 and Fort Lauderdale's 954/754 were not available for use. To solve the problem, in 2002 the northern part of 561 (the Treasure Coast) became area code 772. Despite the Palm Beaches' continued growth, 561 is nowhere near exhaustion; the Palm Beaches will not need another area code until early 2028.

An equivalent formulation describes the process as changing state according to the least value of a set of exponential random variables, one for each possible state it can move to, with the parameters determined by the current state. An example of a CTMC with three states \\\\\\\\{0,1, 2\\\\\\\\} is as follows: the process makes a transition after the amount of time specified by the holding time‚Äîan exponential random variable E_i, where i is its current state. Each random variable is independent and such that E_0\\\\sim \\\\text{Exp}(6), E_1\\\\sim \\\\text{Exp}(12) and E_2\\\\sim \\\\text{Exp}(18). When a transition is to be made, the process moves according to the jump chain, a discrete-time Markov chain with stochastic matrix: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2}  \\\\frac{1}{3} & 0 & \\\\frac{2}{3}  \\\\frac{5}{6} & \\\\frac{1}{6} & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Equivalently, by the theory of competing exponentials, this CTMC changes state from state i according to the minimum of two random variables, which are independent and such that E_{i,j}\\\\sim \\\\text{Exp}(q_{i,j}) for i eq j where the parameters are given by the Q-matrix Q=(q_{i,j}) :\\\\begin{bmatrix} -6 & 3 & 3  4 & -12 & 8  15 & 3 & -18 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Each non-diagonal value can be computed as the product of the original state's holding time with the probability from the jump chain of moving to the given state. The diagonal values are chosen so that each row sums to 0. A CTMC satisfies the Markov property, that its behavior depends only on its current state and not on its past behavior, due to the memorylessness of the exponential distribution and of discrete-time Markov chains. Definition A continuous-time Markov chain (Xt)t ‚â• 0 is defined by: * a finite or countable state space S; * a transition rate matrix Q with dimensions equal to that of S; and * an initial state k such that X_0 = k, or a probability distribution for this first state. For i ‚â† j, the elements qij are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state i to state j. The elements qii could be chosen to be zero, but for mathematical convenience a common convention is to choose them such that each row of Q sums to zero, that is: : q_{ii} = - \\\\sum_{k eq i} q_{ik}. Note how this differs from the definition of transition matrix for discrete Markov chains, where the row sums are all equal to one. There are three other definitions of the process, equivalent to the one above. = Transition probability definition = Another common way to define continuous-time Markov chains is to, instead of the transition rate matrix Q, use the following: * v_i, for i \\\\in S, representing the decay rate (of an exponential distribution) that the system stays in state i once it enters it; and * m_{ij}, for i, j \\\\in S, representing the probability that the system goes to state j, given that it is currently leaving state i. Naturally, m_{ii} must be zero for all i. The values v_i and m_{ij} are closely related to the transition rate matrix Q, by the formulas: : v_i = \\\\sum_{k eq i} q_{ik} = -q_{ii}, \\\\text{ for all } i, : m_{ij} = \\\\frac{q_{ij}}{ \\\\sum_{k eq i} q_{ik} }, \\\\text{ for all } i eq j. Consider an ordered sequence of time instants t_0 < t_1 < \\\\dots < t_n and the states recorded at these times i_0, i_1, \\\\dots, i_n, then it holds that: :\\\\Pr(X_{t_{n+1}} = i_{n+1} \\\\mid X_{t_0} = i_0 , X_{t_1} = i_1 , \\\\ldots, X_{t_n} = i_n ) = \\\\Pr(X_{t_{n+1}} = i_{n+1} \\\\mid X_{t_n} = i_n ) = p_{i_n i_{n+1}}( t_{n+1} - t_n) where the pij is the solution of the forward equation (a first-order differential equation): :P'(t) = P(t) Q with initial condition P(0) being the identity matrix. = Infinitesimal definition = The continuous time Markov chain is characterized by the transition rates, the derivatives with respect to time of the transition probabilities between states i and j. Let X_t be the random variable describing the state of the process at time t, and assume the process is in a state i at time t. By definition of the continuous-time Markov chain, X_{t+h} = j is independent of values prior to instant t; that is, it is independent of \\\\left( X_s : s < t \\\\right). With that in mind, for all j eq i, for all t and for small values of h, the following holds: :\\\\Pr(X(t+h) = j \\\\mid X(t) = i) = q_{ij}h + o(h), where the little-o notation has been employed. When i = j the transition probability above is defined to be always zero. The above equation shows that q_{ij} can be seen as measuring how quickly the transition from i to j happens. = Jump chain/holding time definition = Define a discrete-time Markov chain Yn to describe the nth jump of the process and variables S1, S2, S3, ... to describe holding times in each of the states where Si follows the exponential distribution with rate parameter ‚àíqYiYi. Properties =Communicating classes= Communicating classes, transience, recurrence and positive and null recurrence are defined identically as for discrete-time Markov chains. =Transient behaviour= Write P(t) for the matrix with entries pij = P(Xt = j  X0 = i). Then the matrix P(t) satisfies the forward equation, a first-order differential equation :P'(t) = P(t) Q where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to t. The solution to this equation is given by a matrix exponential :P(t) = e^{tQ} In a simple case such as a CTMC on the state space {1,2}. The general Q matrix for such a process is the following 2 √ó 2 matrix with Œ±,Œ≤ > 0 :Q = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\alpha & \\\\alpha  \\\\beta & -\\\\beta \\\\end{pmatrix}. The above relation for forward matrix can be solved explicitly in this case to give :P(t) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t}  \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} \\\\end{pmatrix} However, direct solutions are complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that Q is the generator for a semigroup of matrices :P(t+s) = e^{(t+s)Q} = e^{tQ} e^{sQ} = P(t) P(s) is used. =Stationary distribution= The stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of t. Observe that for the two-state process considered earlier with P(t) given by :P(t) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t}  \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}e^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} \\\\end{pmatrix} as t ‚Üí ‚àû the distribution tends to :P_\\\\pi = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}  \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} \\\\end{pmatrix} Observe that each row has the same distribution as this does not depend on starting state. The row vector ' may be found by solving :\\\\pi Q = 0. with the additional constraint that :\\\\sum_{i \\\\in S} \\\\pi_i = 1. Example 1 Directed graph representation of a continuous-time Markov chain describing the state of financial markets (note: numbers are made-up). The image to the right describes a continuous-time Markov chain with state-space {Bull market, Bear market, Stagnant market} and transition rate matrix :: Q=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -0.025 & 0.02 & 0.005  0.3 & -0.5 & 0.2  0.02 & 0.4 & -0.42 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The stationary distribution of this chain can be found by solving \\\\pi Q=0, subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1 to obtain :\\\\pi = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0.885 & 0.071 & 0.044 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Example 2 Transition graph with transition probabilities, exemplary for the states 1, 5, 6 and 8. There is a bidirectional secret passage between states 2 and 8. The image to the right describes a discrete-time Markov chain modeling Pac-Man with state-space {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac- dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the monsters move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions. Entries with probability zero are removed in the following transition matrix: Q=\\\\begin{pmatrix} & \\\\frac{1}{2} & & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4}&&&\\\\frac{1}{4} & \\\\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\\\frac{1}{3} & & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{3} & & \\\\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\\\frac{1}{3} & & & \\\\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{4} & && \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & \\\\frac{1}{4} & & & & & \\\\frac{1}{2} & & \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} This Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving \\\\pi Q=0, subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is \\\\pi=(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)\\\\%. The central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least. =Time reversal= For a CTMC Xt, the time-reversed process is defined to be \\\\hat X_t = X_{T-t}. By Kelly's lemma this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process. A chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. Kolmogorov's criterion states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions. = Embedded Markov chain = One method of finding the stationary probability distribution, , of an ergodic continuous-time Markov chain, Q, is by first finding its embedded Markov chain (EMC). Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a jump process. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, S, is denoted by sij, and represents the conditional probability of transitioning from state i into state j. These conditional probabilities may be found by : s_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{q_{ij}}{\\\\sum_{k eq i} q_{ik}} & \\\\text{if } i eq j  0 & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} From this, S may be written as :S = I - \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{diag}(Q) \\\\right)^{-1} Q where I is the identity matrix and diag(Q) is the diagonal matrix formed by selecting the main diagonal from the matrix Q and setting all other elements to zero. To find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find \\\\varphi such that :\\\\varphi S = \\\\varphi, with \\\\varphi being a row vector, such that all elements in \\\\varphi are greater than 0 and _1 = 1. From this, may be found as :\\\\pi = {-\\\\varphi (\\\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\\\over \\\\left\\\\ \\\\varphi (\\\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\\\right\\\\_1}. (S may be periodic, even if Q is not. Once is found, it must be normalized to a unit vector.) Another discrete- time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a Œ¥-skeleton--the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing X(t) at intervals of Œ¥ units of time. The random variables X(0), X(Œ¥), X(2Œ¥), ... give the sequence of states visited by the Œ¥-skeleton. See also * Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process) Notes References * A. A.

The Polecats The band \\"Cult Heroes\\" was formed in 1977 by Tim Worman (known as Tim Polecat, vocalist), Boz Boorer (guitarist and vocalist), Phil Bloomberg (bassist), and Chris Hawkes (drummer). After finding much difficulty persuading promoters to book them on the rockabilly circuit with a name sounding \\"too punk\\", they adopted Hawkes' suggested band name The Polecats. Hawkes was later replaced by Neil Rooney. Three years after forming, the band signed to the fledgling British rockabilly record label Nervous Records, and released the single \\"Rockabilly Guy\\" in 1979. By 1980 the Polecats had signed to Mercury Records. That same year they released their most successful LP, Polecats Are Go! The band had UK chart success with a David Bowie cover \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\", a reworking of \\"Rockabilly Guy\\", and another cover version of the T.Rex song \\"Jeepster\\". In 1983, they entered the charts in the United States with their song \\"Make a Circuit With Me.\\" Shortly after this, John Buck replaced Neil Rooney on drums. Boorer left the group in the same year but led a Polecats reunion in 1989, which produced a live album and a new studio set. Raucous Records released a compilation album of Boz Boorer's work entitled Between The Polecats in early 2001. The band continue to tour when time permits, with the most recent gig being at The Hot Rod Hayride in Bisley, Surrey, UK on 30 July 2016.Morrison, Craig. Go cat go!: rockabilly music and its makers, p. 239 (1998) ()LeRoy, Dan. The Greatest Music Never Sold, p. 213 (2007) () Morrissey Boorer, along with guitarist Alain Whyte, joined Morrissey in 1991 when the singer assembled a new band tour in promotion of his album Kill Uncle. Along with Whyte, he is credited with successfully synthesizing jangle pop and American rockabilly to create a new sound for Morrissey that helped to revitalize his career. Since 1991, Boorer has worked not only as one of Morrissey's co-writers and guitarists but also as the band's musical director. In 1994, Boorer produced for the first time a record for Morrissey: it was for the single \\"Interlude\\", a duet between Morrissey and Siouxsie, a one-off released under the banner of both artists. Boorer notably directed the strings section. Solo career and other work Boorer has released solo material between his recording and touring. In 2008, he released the album Miss Pearl. Besides having a solo career, writing and playing for Morrissey and touring occasionally with the Polecats, Boorer has also worked with other artists, including Adam Ant, Kirsty MacColl, Joan Armatrading, Jools Holland, and Edwyn Collins. He also worked with his wife's band, the Shillelagh Sisters between 1983 and 1998. In 2009, Boorer produced the debut EP by Tiguana Bibles, \\"Child of the Moon\\". He and his wife own a studio in Portugal, Serra Vista Studio. In the Summer of 2010, Boorer recorded, produced and mixed Portuguese garage/blues/rock band Murdering Tripping Blues' second album, \\"Share the Fire\\". In 2011, Happy Martyr was formed with rapper Alex Lusty. The plan was to record some acoustic, stripped- down hip hop, which Boorer described as \\"an MC fronting early Tyrannosaurus Rex\\". The albums One Square Mile and Nothing Like Love were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively. In August 2012, Boorer released his fourth solo album, \\"Some of the Parts\\" and the single \\"Slippery Forces\\" on Fabrique Records. The song \\"Saunders Ferry Lane\\" features the vocals of James Maker, \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\" is a cover of the Kris Kristofferson song, John Moore (of Black Box Recorder, The Jesus and Mary Chain) appears as a special guest on diverse instruments. In June 2014, Boorer teamed up with Art Brut (band) singer Eddie Argos for a new solo single, \\"Girl From Atlanta\\", which was included on his solo album \\"Age Of Boom\\" in 2016 for Fabrique Records. Personal life Boorer has been married to Lyn since 1981, and they have two daughters: Pearl- May and Billie-Rose.

Name and iconography The station is named after General Ignacio Zaragoza, commander of the Mexican troops that defeated the French invaders at the Battle of Puebla and the nearby Avenida Ignacio Zaragoza. The station logo depicts this Mexican military genius astride his horse. General information The station was opened on 5 September 1969 and it initially served as the eastern terminus of Line 1. Although Metro Zaragoza is no longer the terminal station for Line 1 (usurped by Metro Pantitl√°n since the extension of the line in 1984) its role as an important station still remains. It serves as the interconnection point for many suburban bus lines that dissipate into the suburban eastern reaches of the state of M√©xico.

Leonard Calvert (1606 ‚Äì June 9, 1647) was the first proprietary governor of the Province of Maryland. He was the second son of The 1st Baron Baltimore (1579‚Äì1632), the first proprietor of Maryland. His elder brother Cecil (1605‚Äì1675), who inherited the colony and the title upon the death of their father George, April 15, 1632, appointed Leonard as governor of the Colony in his absence. Early life Leonard was born to George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore and his wife Anne Mynne, and was named in honor of his paternal grandfather, Leonard Calvert of Yorkshire. Colonization of Newfoundland In 1625, when Calvert's father was created Lord Baltimore and received letters patent for the creation of a Province of Avalon in the island of Newfoundland from James I of England, he relocated part of his newly converted Roman Catholic family to Newfoundland. Leonard Calvert accompanied his father to the new colony of Newfoundland in 1638. The colony ultimately failed due to disease, extreme cold, and attacks by the French, and the family returned to England. After a few years, Baltimore declared Avalon a failure and traveled to the Colony of Virginia, where he found the climate much more suitable and temperate, but was met with an unwelcome reception from the Virginians' government and ruling class. Establishment of Maryland In 1632, Baltimore returned to England, where he negotiated an additional patent for the colony of Maryland from King Charles I. However, before the papers could be executed, Baltimore died on April 15, 1632. On June 20, 1632, Cecil, the second Lord Baltimore, received from the king the charter for the colony of Maryland that his father had negotiated. The charter consisted of 23 sections, but the most important conferred on Lord Baltimore and his heirs, besides the right of absolute ownership in the soil, certain powers, ecclesiastical as well as civil, resembling those possessed by the nobility of the Middle Ages. Leonard Calvert was appointed by his brother as the colony's first governor. =The Ark and The Dove= Two vessels, The Ark and The Dove, carrying over 300 settlers, sailed from the harbour of Cowes, England, on November 22, 1633, arriving at just inside the huge harbor and bay (later to be named \\"Hampton Roads\\") at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, between Cape Charles and Cape Henry and passed off \\"Point Comfort\\" at the mouths of the intersecting James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers, in the colony of Virginia on February 24, 1634 (also later the site of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach on the south side and Newport News and Hampton on the northern peninsula). After exploring the area, a few weeks later they sailed up the Potomac River, north of the Virginia shoreline and the southern border of their new colony and landed on the northern shore at Blakistone Island (later renamed St. Clement's Island) on March 25, 1634, erected a large cross, gave thanks and celebrated a Roman Catholic/Christian Mass with Father Andrew White who had accompanied them (later to be celebrated as \\"Maryland Day\\", an official state and local holiday). Two days later, on March 27, they returned further south down-river near the point where the Potomac meets the Bay at what is now St. Mary's City, then the site of a Native American village of the Yaocomico branch of the Piscataway tribe, whom the paramount chief had moved away to accommodate the new English settlers, so as to take advantage of the trading opportunities of their more powerful technology: industries, weapons and implements, and they began the work of establishing a settlement there. Governor of Maryland Following his brother's instructions, Leonard Calvert at first attempted to govern the country in an absolutist way, but in January 1635, he had to summon a colonial assembly, which became the foundation and first session of the modern General Assembly of Maryland, the third legislature to be established in the English colonies, after the House of Burgesses in the Dominion of Virginia, and the General Court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 1638, the Assembly forced him to govern according to the common law of England, and subsequently the right to initiate legislation passed to the new General Assembly, representing the common \\"freeholders\\" (owners of freehold property) as subjects of the Crown. In 1638, Calvert seized a trading post at Kent Island established by the Virginian William Claiborne. In 1643, Governor Calvert went to England to discuss policies with his brother Lord Baltimore, the proprietor, leaving the affairs of the colony in charge of acting Governor Giles Brent, his brother-in-law (he had married Ann Brent, daughter of Richard Brent). Calvert returned to Maryland in 1644 with a new wife and children (William, born in 1643, and a daughter, born in 1644). That same year, Claiborne returned and led an uprising of Maryland Protestants against the Catholic Proprietor. Calvert was soon forced to flee southward to Virginia. He returned at the head of an armed force in 1646 and reasserted proprietarial rule. Leonard Calvert died of an illness in the summer of 1647. Before he died, he wrote a will naming Margaret Brent (the sister of Giles, and a future, historically famous planter, lawyer, and female advocate for women's rights) as the executor of his estate. Calvert also named his friend and fellow passenger aboard The Ark and The Dove, Thomas Greene, as his successor to the governorship. In 1890, the State of Maryland erected an obelisk monument to Calvert and his wife at Historic St. Mary's City which had a historical district created to commemorate the colonial origins of the colony. Leonard Calvert's lost grave The location of Leonard Calvert's grave has been lost to history, but there is an effort underway to find it. Archeologists based in the Historic St. Mary's City research complex believe that Leonard Calvert is buried somewhere in St. Inigoes, Maryland. The most likely spot has been narrowed down to somewhere on Webster Field, now a small U.S. Naval Aircraft facility located on the water on the Western side of St. Inigoes. Several archeological digs have been conducted but the grave has yet to be discovered. Members of the Calvert family in the settlement were known to be buried in lead coffins. It is not known if this is how Leonard Calvert was buried. His death, due to disease, happened suddenly and unexpectedly after a period of religious warfare had wracked the colony. Soon after his death, one of the first laws requiring religious tolerance was written and enacted in the colony, further codifying its original proprietarial mandate of religious tolerance and reestablishing peace.

An old tradition, they usually take place after dark in summer. Nowadays, some major cities, such as Barcelona, host \\"permanent\\" verbenas (revetlla in Catalan), but these have less tradition character than those that appear for only a few days each year. A large contemporary verbena features mechanical amusement rides, sideshow attractions, and usually some sort of gambling. Typical verbena food includes churros, ham, cheese, marzipan, candied egg yolks (\\"yemas\\"), candied quince (\\"membrillo\\"), and sugared fruits‚Äîthough in recent years, modern junk foods have found their way into the mix. There are always alcoholic beverages‚Äîusually Spanish wine, sangr√≠a and lager beer. There is usually music and dancing, either organized or spontaneously. In recent years, verbenas have incorporated recorded popular music, rock music, and even karaoke, but in Andalusia and even beyond, flamenco and other traditional music still dominate verbenas.http://www.travelnet.co.il/espagne/menu/TheEntertainmentinSpain.htm http://www.hectorocio.com/fiestas.html When the musicians take a break, a runner carrying fireworks (toro de fuego) may dash into the crowd.

He is best known as the drummer for the Smiths, an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. Life and career Joyce was born in Manchester to Irish Catholic parents, and attended St Gregory's Grammar School in the city. While the Smiths provided Joyce with his first taste of success, he had previously drummed for Manchester band The Hoax and Irish punk rock group Victim. Joyce was a member of the Smiths throughout the band's existence (1982‚Äì87). Immediately after the break-up of the band, Joyce and Smiths bassist Andy Rourke played with Sin√©ad O'Connor. They, along with Craig Gannon, also provided the rhythm section for two singles by Smiths' singer Morrissey ‚Äì \\"Interesting Drug\\" and \\"The Last of the Famous International Playboys\\" and their B-sides. Work with Suede, Buzzcocks, Public Image Limited, Julian Cope, P. P. Arnold and Pete Wylie followed throughout the 1990s. Joyce, Rourke, and Gannon reunited to work on a project with fellow Manchester musician Aziz Ibrahim (formerly of the Stone Roses and Simply Red), ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead (as Moondog One), and Vinny Peculiar. Lawsuits In 1996, Joyce sued former Smiths' colleagues Johnny Marr and Morrissey for an equal share of performance and recording royalties. Joyce won the case and was awarded damages of around ¬£1 million from Morrissey and Marr. According to Morrissey, who unsuccessfully appealed Joyce's claims, Joyce first sued Morrissey and Marr in 1989 for 25% of the Smiths' recording royalties. In 1996, Joyce won the case \\"on the basis of the 1890 Partnership Act\\". The next year (1997), according to Morrissey, \\"Joyce was paid ¬£215,000 from me, and ¬£215,000 from Johnny Marr. In 2001, as a final payment of back royalties, Johnny Marr paid Joyce ¬£260,000 plus 'costs'. At this time I [Morrissey] was in the US and was not served with court proceedings, so Joyce obtained a Default Judgment. He then put forward a claim from me for ¬£688,000 ‚Äîwell above and beyond the amount Johnny Marr was ordered to pay. In my absence, the figure was not contested. Since 2001, and because of the Default Judgment against me, Joyce has taken out Third Party Orders against the following societies: my personal bank account in England, Smiths royalties from Warner Music, my personal PRS royalties, my personal PPL royalties, and he has attempted to seize UK concert fees from venue to venue. This money, to date, totals ¬£700,000. This figure is in addition to the figures mentioned above.\\" Morrissey went on to claim that \\"[the] Joyce action is continuous. Because of his Default Judgment he continues to take my royalties, and the royalties of others mentioned above, from Warner Music‚Äîconsequently I have not received record royalties since 2001.\\"True to You: a Morrissey zine , True-to-you.net; accessed 11 January 2016. 2007 onward In July 2007, Joyce, along with former bandmate Andy Rourke, released Inside The Smiths, a DVD which chronicled their experiences of being in the band. In October 2007, Joyce toured the UK playing drums for Vinny Peculiar with Bonehead on bass guitar, and in 2008 ran a successful night at The Brickhouse in Manchester called \\"Alternative Therapy\\". In parallel to his music career, Joyce works as a DJ and broadcaster, including occasional appearances on BBC 6 Music.Mike Joyce details, Bbc.co.uk; accessed 11 January 2016. Joyce has hosted shows on East Village Radio, an internet station. Since October 2017, Joyce has hosted a weekly radio show on Manchester radio station XS Manchester. In October 2018, the show was nominated in the 'Best Specialist Music Show' category at the ARIAS 2018 radio awards. Joyce is a patron of the Manchester-based charity Back on Track; as part of this role, Joyce ran a special cooking session with some of the charity's clients, during which they cooked vegetables from his allotment, and featured as a story on ITV Granada.

KG is a German (originally Austro-Bohemian) manufacturer of musical instruments, with one division that manufactures guitars and basses, and another that manufactures other string instruments, such as violins, violas, cellos, double basses and bows for stringed instruments. Much of H√∂fner's popularity is attributed to Sir Paul McCartney's use of the H√∂fner 500/1 bass throughout his career. This violin-shaped model is commonly referred to as the \\"Beatle bass\\". Company history A H√∂fner 500/1 \\"violin bass\\" similar to the one used by Paul McCartney A German luthier, Karl H√∂fner (1864-1955), founded the H√∂fner company in the city of Sch√∂nbach in 1887, at a time when the city, later part of the Czech Republic, was populated by Germans. He soon became the largest string instrument manufacturer in the country. His sons, Josef and Walter, joined the company around 1920, and began spreading the brand's reputation worldwide. The company became involved in production for the German army in World War II producing wooden crates and soles for boots. After the war, Germans were expelled from the Sudetenland, forcing H√∂fner to move to West Germany. The company initially moved to an ex-work camp at M√∂hrendorf in 1948, but soon became involved in the development of a new township and factories in Bubenreuth. The new H√∂fner factory opened in 1950, and expanded three times between 1953 and 1960. Karl H√∂fner, the founder, lived to see the company's revival, and died in Bubenreuth in 1955. In 1964, the company built a further factory at Hagenau, about 5 km from Bubenreuth, to machine wood parts for assembly at Bubenreuth. They expanded the Hagenau factory twice in the 1970s. The daughter of Walter H√∂fner, Gerhilde, began working for the company in the mid 1950s taking an active part in all aspects of management. Her husband, Christian Benker, joined the company in 1963. They together became the driving force for the company as Josef and Walter entered retirement in the 1970s. =Changes of ownership= In 1994, H√∂fner became part of the Boosey & Hawkes Group, and was able to expand and upgrade its facilities with the influx of cash. In 1997, the company moved from Bubenreuth to Hagenau. After a near-bankruptcy in 2003 Boosey & Hawkes sold its musical instrument division (including the H√∂fner and Buffet Crampon companies) to the Music Group, a company formed by rescue buyout specialists Rutland Fund Management, for ¬£33.2 million. H√∂fner remained a part of this conglomerate until December 2004, when the Music Group sold the company to Klaus Sch√∂ller who had been the general manager of H√∂fner for many years, with his wife Ulrike Schrimpff, the finance director at H√∂fner along with Rob Olsen and Graham Stockley who were USA and UK partners. Klaus Sch√∂ller and Ulrike Schrimpff remain as the owners of the business today. = Distribution =  Europe  The H√∂fner company has nearly always been responsible for its own distribution within Europe. The exceptions to this have been: * The Netherlands where the distributor in the 1950s and 1960s was the Van Wouw company (which closed in the 1970s) * Spain where the distributor is Keller * The United Kingdom, in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s H√∂fner instruments were distributed by Selmer of London (not to be confused with The Selmer Company). Today electric guitars are distributed by Barnes and Mullins while classical guitars and stringed instruments are distributed by Clive Guthrie.  United States  EMMC based in NJ was the distributor for bass guitars for many years until 1995 until Boosey & Hawkes bought the company in 1994. Boosey & Hawkes took over distribution from 1995-2003. During these years the improvements of quality and brand exposure were significant. The overall bass and guitar lines were redesigned and new successful 6-string jazz guitar models were created and introduced in late 1999. The Music Group, a Venture Capital Company took over Boosey & Hawkes from 2003 until 2004 when the H√∂fner company was purchased via a management buyout. In 2005, H√∂fner's United States distribution was picked up by Classic Musical Instruments (CMI) in Kenosha, WI. CMI ceased trading in 2012 and distribution passed to Musical Distributors Group (MDG) in New Jersey. In late 2018 MDG merged with Adam Hall North America and is the current USA distributor. The Rob Olsen era 1998-Current. Rob Olsen worked at Boosey & Hawkes as H√∂fner Product Manager in late 1998 and remains responsible for USA distribution for Adam Hall. He designed or co-designed many key H√∂fner models, managed overall quality, and increased visibility of the company (especially from 1999-2012). Rob Olsen era H√∂fner models include: Jazzica Custom, Verythin Classic, The New President, The Vice President, Verythin Standard, The Chancellor, The Club Bass reissue, The 50th Anniversary Violin bass, Club 40 John Lennnon limited edition, Violin finish guitars and basses, Colorama reissue, H5 jazz guitars and others. Rob may be best known for creating the flagship Icon/Ignition series basses and guitars. He was responsible for negotiations and creation of the Ed Sullivan Series basses, Guitar Hero and Beatles Rockband connections. Rob Olsen opened and managed the H√∂fner Custom Shop (still in operation), which produces special instruments and colors for shops and artists, including Wilco, Lenny Kravitz, Cheap Trick, Bon Jovi, Tesla, Sheryl Crow, and others. The most famous custom shop model may be the Paul McCartney Jubilee bass that Paul used for the Concert For The Queen in 2012, where Paul sported a painted in a transparent colored Union Jack flag custom shop bass. Rob Olsen along with Graham Stockley in the U.K. (and later based in Germany at the H√∂fner workshop) were the key players in exposing and bringing the brand to desired status by creating quality features and models, artist- relations and signings of visible artists (officially with Paul McCartney), Cheap Trick, Bon Jovi, Tesla, Wilco and many others. They also achieved rapid dealer growth and the creation of the ad campaigns during the USA H√∂fner brand launch years. Selected models H√∂fner Shorty The Selmer company devised names for these instruments for the UK market. Elsewhere, they were known by model numbers. * The Ambassador. A thinline semi-acoustic with two florentine cutaways. * The Chancellor. A high-end archtop guitar available in limited numbers. * Club 40, 50 and 60. Hollow bodied electric guitars without soundholes. Still manufactured, the current Clubs have Gibson Les Paul style bodyshape. * The original Coloramas were inexpensive semi-solid body electric guitars with plywood construction. The current Chinese made ones are solid bodies with retro styling. * The Committee was the top-of-the-range archtop. * The Congress, a non-cutaway archtop guitar. Early models had a 12th fret neck join. * J17. The current range of archtops. * The President: a family of mid- range archtops, with a single cutaway. A version, the \\"New president\\" is still manufactured. * The Senator: a family of archtops, with many variations. * The Shorty. A relatively recent (1982) travel guitar Now made in China. * The Verythin. A semi-acoustic guitar with a 30mm deep body. They produced regular, Bigsby and stereo versions. * Violin guitar. Introduced subsequently to the violin bass. * The V2 and V3 solid body electric guitars with a stratocaster like body shape. Notable H√∂fner users =Beatles= Beatles guitarists George Harrison and John Lennon used H√∂fner electric guitars. Harrison used a President model and a Club 40 early on in his association with the group. Lennon's first electric guitar was a Club 40 model that he purchased in 1959 from Hessy's music store in Liverpool. He used this for about one year, then bought a Rickenbacker \\"Capri\\" model. The Club 40 was briefly loaned to Paul McCartney and then it was sold. The band's original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe played a H√∂fner 500/5 Bass. Paul McCartney A Club 40 as used by John Lennon The company is most famous through its association with Beatles songwriter, singer, and instrumentalist Paul McCartney, who is a longtime user of the H√∂fner 500/1 model hollow-body electric bass, first manufactured in 1956. McCartney played two left-handed 500/1 basses during most of the group's career‚Äîa 1961 model with pickups mounted close together towards the neck, and a 1963 model, with the second pickup mounted closer to the bridge. McCartney used the 1961 bass until the recording of With The Beatles in late 1963, when he got his second 500/1. McCartney used his 1963 bass almost exclusively during The Beatles' touring career, using his 1961 bass (repaired and refinished in 1964) as a backup. By 1965 McCartney had begun using a Rickenbacker bass in the studio‚Äîbut he did bring out his 1961 model for the \\"Revolution\\" promo film in 1968, and for the documentary Let It Be the following year. During the shooting, however, the 1961 bass was stolen, and McCartney used his newer H√∂fner for the remainder of the film, including the famous rooftop performance. McCartney continued to use his 1963 H√∂fner extensively throughout his solo career and continues to use it. = H√∂fner 500/1 bass players = * The Beatles and Wings bass guitarist and singer songwriter Paul McCartney * Amy Winehouse bassist Dale Davis * Barenaked Ladies bassist Jim Creeggan * Beach Boys guitarist Carl Wilson on \\"Lei'd in Hawaii\\" (1967), and Alan Jardine on Carl and the Passions ‚Äì \\"So Tough\\" * Big Star bassists Andy Hummel and Ken Stringfellow, and Alex Chilton bassist Terry Manning * Chris Wood * Deerhoof bassist Satomi Matsuzaki * Errol Holt * Fleet Foxes bassist Christian Wargo * The La's bassist John Power, in the meeting that had the band in 2005 * Peter Tosh bassist Robbie Shakespeare * Sum 41 bassist Cone McCaslin recorded bass lines for some songs from Screaming Bloody Murder with H√∂fner bass * Tame Impala members Kevin Parker and Nick Allbrook * The Bright Light Social Hour bassist Jack O'Brien on Space Is Still the Place (2015) * The Searchers bassist Tony Jackson *Brian Wheat -Tesla (band) *Tom Petersson - Cheap Trick *Michael Rhodes - studio bassist *Leland Sklar - The Section (band), studio bassist *Bob Glaub - studio musician = H√∂fner 500/2 bass players = * Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth used a 500/2 bass * Tom Petty performed with Mudcrutch playing a 500/2, and appears with a 500/1 in the liner notes for Playback * Prolific session bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen often plays a 500/2 bass * Nicolas Godin of Air French Band * Tony Scherr played on a 500/2 live with Bill Frisell = H√∂fner guitar users = 1953 model 465s acoustic archtop * Bert Weedon, now best known for his tutorial works, had a variety of H√∂fners. * Hank Marvin's first guitar was a Congress. * Hugh Cornwell ex member of The Stranglers used a H√∂fner Razerwood S7L solid- body. * Eric Clapton learned to play on a H√∂fner acoustic. * The young Ritchie Blackmore played a club 50. * A Senator was Peter Green's first real guitar. * Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones traded in a stack of records in order to purchase his first guitar, which was a hollow-body H√∂fner cut away. * Folk Baroque pioneer Davy Graham played a Congress. * Mark Knopfler's first guitar was a V2 solid. * At the age of 13, Jimmy Page made his first televised appearance in 1957 on BBC1 playing a H√∂fner President. * The Stone Roses' John Squire used a H√∂fner semi-acoustic guitar (featuring a self-applied Jackson Pollock-style paintjob). * The Auteurs' Luke Haines uses a Committee. * Jamie Hince' of The Kills *Early Beatles bassist Stuart Sutcliffe used prize money he won in an art competition (50 guineas) to purchase a H√∂fner President bass. * Albert Lee's first guitar was a H√∂fner President acoustic. * Tav Falco has played only a H√∂fner violin guitar, with built-in factory fuzztone, since 1980. * Tonny Koeswoyo used H√∂fner Galaxy Series & Verythin Series * John Lennon of The Beatles bought a Club 40 as his first electric guitar in 1959. * Chris Rea's first guitar was a H√∂fner Verithin 3, which he played until 1979. * Bernie Marsden's first electric guitar was a Colorama.

It is a division of the Ernie Ball corporation. The company is most well-known for its electric and bass guitars. Determined to maintain a reputation for quality, the Music Man company largely produces high-end guitars, especially after being acquired by Ernie Ball in 1984.  History  = Early years = Stingray bass in Trans Gold finish, 2001 model In 1971, Forrest White and Tom Walker formed Tri-Sonix, Inc. Walker had previously been a sales representative at Fender. Walker approached Leo Fender about financial help in the founding. Because of a ten-year non-compete clause in the 1965 contract that sold the Fender companies to the CBS Corporation, Leo Fender became a silent partner. White had worked with Leo Fender since 1954, in the very early days of the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company as the plant manager, eventually becoming vice president, and stayed on after the company was sold to CBS, but grew unhappy with their management and resigned in 1966. Fender did not like the corporate name, so it changed first to Musitek, Inc., and in January 1974 the final name, Music Man, appeared. In 1974, the company started producing its first product, an amplifier designed by Leo Fender and Tom Walker called the \\"Sixty Five,\\" a hybrid of tube and solid-state technology that players characterized as \\"loud as hell.\\" The number of designs rapidly increased, and 15 of the 28 pages from the 1976 catalogue were dedicated to amplification. In 1975, Fender's legal restriction expired and, after a vote of the board, he was named the president of Music Man. Fender also operated a consulting firm, CLF Research, in Fullerton, California. By 1976, it had built a manufacturing facility for musical instruments, and was contracted to make Music Man products. In June 1976, production started on guitars and in August basses followed. These instruments were designed by Fender and White. The 1976 catalogue shows the first offerings: a two-pickup guitar, the StingRay 1, and the StingRay bass. Both instruments featured bolt-on neck designs. The basses featured a distinctive 3+1 tuner arrangement to help eliminate \\"dead spots,\\" while the guitars came with a traditional, Fender-style 6-on-a-side tuner array. The StingRay Bass featured a single large humbucking pickup (located somewhat toward but not adjacent to the bridge) with a two-band fixed- frequency EQ. A row of string mutes sat on the bridge. Basses were produced in fretted and fretless versions. Tom Walker played a large part in the design of the bass preamp. They were the first production guitar and basses to use active electronics which could boost levels in selected frequency bands. The preamps were coated with epoxy to prevent reverse engineering. The StingRay Bass sold well. While highly innovative electronically, the guitar was not blessed cosmetically and met with little success. In December 1978, a two- pickup bass was introduced called the Sabre (discontinued in 1991). A redesigned guitar bearing the same name followed. Both sold poorly. CLF Research and Music Man were treated as separate companies, headed by Fender and Walker, respectively. Fender made the guitars and basses, while Walker's company made the amplifiers and sold accessories. The instruments were made at CLF and shipped to Music Man's warehouse, where each instrument was inspected and tested. Problems with fibers in the finish caused Music Man's inspectors to reject a high percentage of the instruments, and return them to CLF for refinishing. Since Music Man didn't pay CLF Research until the instrument finishes were deemed acceptable, a rift developed between CLF and Music Man over payment. Low sales stressed the staff. The company's internal conflicts caused Leo Fender to form another partnership: :Leo had decided to market guitars under another name besides Music Man in 10/79 due to tension between CLF and Music Man. Production of bodies and necks for both Music Man and G&L; were concurrent up to and including March 1981. G&L; was incorporated May 1980, although some early models with the moniker \\"G&L;\\" have body dates from March 1980. In an interview conducted by Gav Townsing, George Fullerton offers this scenario: :\\"At the end of 1979 we stopped building for Music Man and never made another item for them. We really weren‚Äôt friends at that point and not even talking.\\" In November 1979, Leo had enough of Music Man's pressure and the ties were cut. A contract was given to Grover Jackson to build bass bodies and assemble the instruments with CLF necks and the remaining CLF hardware. When CLF stopped making necks Jackson made those also. Given this climate, the StingRay guitar was quietly dropped from the line. The Sabre guitar soldiered on until 1984. A graphite-neck StingRay Bass debuted in 1980. Fender had been opposed to the idea. The neck was made by Modulus. It was called the Cutlass and the two pickup variant, the Cutlass II. Neither it, nor the new translucent finishes, were able to turn the financial tide and by 1984 the company was near bankruptcy. After looking at a few offers Music Man was sold to Ernie Ball on March 7, 1984. Music Man's remaining physical assets were sold on June 1, 1984. The production of amplifiers, which were manufactured at a separate factory, ceased. = Rebirth = Tony Levin playing a Stingray 5 Ernie Ball had started producing a modern acoustic bass guitar in 1972 under the name Earthwood but, despite endorsement by John Entwistle, the bass was only moderately successful in terms of sales and production stopped around the mid-1970s. Ball's partner in this company was George Fullerton. The factory, which Ball still owned at the time of the Music Man purchase, was located in San Luis Obispo, California and that is where Music Man started producing basses in 1985. Ernie Ball Music Man improved their visibility in the guitar market with a succession of new guitar models, largely player- endorsed, including the Silhouette (1986), Steve Morse Signature (1987), Eddie Van Halen Signature/Axis model (1990), Albert Lee Signature (1993), Steve Lukather Signature (1993), the John Petrucci six and seven-string guitars (1999). They also introduced a series of new electric bass models, including the StingRay 5 (1987), the Sterling Bass (1993) and the Bongo Bass (2003) (the futuristic look of which was designed in conjunction with the BMW DesignworksUSA team). While none of these could compete against Fender or Gibson on sales figures, Music Man outpaced the competition by making 'players' guitars with quick change pickup assemblies, Teflon coated truss- rods, low-noise pickup designs, piezo bridge pickups, five and six bolt neck joints, sculpted neck heels, graphite acrylic resin coated body cavities and most importantly, consistently high quality fit and finish. = Entry-level versions = Initially, Music Man refused to enter the budget instrument market. In the late 1990s, demand for cheaper versions of Music Man instruments had increased, and other companies had begun to exploit this market gap by producing replica instruments in various East-Asian countries. Music Man responded by licensing its designs to HHI/Davitt & Hanser, launching OLP (Officially Licensed Products) to give Music Man market coverage in this price point. This agreement continued until 2008. As a replacement for the OLP instruments, the company developed an in-house line of guitars and basses. Initially branded as S.U.B. for \\"Sport Utility Bass,\\" this became the non- acronym \\"SUB\\" after two models of six-string guitar were launched. This mid- range line, with production cost one-third to one-half less than the \\"standard\\" Music Man instruments, was launched in 2003, with the goal of proving that a quality instrument without the bells and whistles could be made in the USA. Produced at the same facilities as the Music Man models, the major defining factors of the SUB were a non-angled \\"slab\\" body finished with a textured paint that didn't call for polishing, as well as necks with a matte painted back instead of the \\"oil and wax\\" finish applied to the higher-end models. Savings were realized largely from reduced production time, as opposed to cutting the quality of the wood, hardware, or electronics, allowing the SUB lines to achieve their price-point without loss of quality. The product was a success, and supported Music Man when its main line was in a slump. The SUB models were eventually discontinued in September 2006. Sterling Ball commented that, due to the quickly growing $1,000+ segment of the guitar industry, there were fewer and fewer SUBs in production each year. First John Petrucci signature model In 2009, as a replacement for the SUB line, Music Man licensed Praxis Musical Instruments to build a new import budget brand, Sterling by Music Man. Basses included the RAY34/RAY35 (StingRay 4- and 5-string copies) and the SB14 (Sterling copy). Guitars included the AX20 (Axis Super Sport), AX40 (Axis), JP50 (John Petrucci) and the SILO30 (Silhouette). In 2012, Praxis expanded this line with the \\"Sterling By Music Man SUB Series\\" to compete with other sub-$300 USD \\"beginner\\" instruments, produced in Indonesia and other Far East countries using \\"non-standard\\" woods (i.e. not typically thought of as \\"tone woods\\") to keep production costs low. = New models = John Myung playing a Music Man Bongo bass 2003 saw the introduction of the Music Man Bongo Bass, the result of a partnership with DesignworksUSA, a design firm better known for its work with BMW. This bass features a 24-fret rosewood fingerboard with \\"moon\\"-shaped inlays and a four-band active EQ powered by an 18V supply. The Bongo was made available with four or five strings, in fretted or fretless and left-handed versions, with the choice of HS (humbucker/single- coil), HH (dual humbuckers), and H (single humbucker, the traditional Music Man setup) pickup configurations and a pickup blend pot for ultimate versatility. These pickup configurations were adopted on other Music Man models three years later, using a five-way pickup selector with coil-tap capabilities. In 2008, Music Man released the Bongo 6, its first six-string bass. Sterling Ball had previously said \\"We won't be making any six-string basses unless a high-profile player asks for one,\\" until John Myung (Dream Theater) collaborated on the prototype Bongo. Steve Lukather playing the Limited Edition \\"Dargie Delight\\" version of his signature model guitar Music Man introduced the 'Big Al' bass, based on the Albert Lee signature guitar, with an 18V-powered 4-band EQ, active/passive switching, series/parallel pickup wiring and three single-coil pickups with neodymium magnets. As of 2010, the 'Big Al' bass came in a five-string version with the choice of H and SSS pickup configurations. The Big Al and Reflex basses were discontinued in 2015. The JPX, introduced 2010, is a variant of the John Petrucci signature model, commemorating the ten-year collaboration with Petrucci. The new body shape has a slightly thinner upper horn and a more symmetric bridge end profile. The body is also chambered for added acoustic resonance. Music Man launched the Bass Player Live Deluxe Classic Collection, with elements of the first Music Man basses ‚Äî a two-band EQ, a chrome trussrod wheel, vintage skinny fret wire and nut, and hardened steel bridge plate with \\"Classic\\" stainless steel saddles and adjustable mute pads, 7.5\\" radius neck ‚Äî with modern details such as a six-bolt neck mounting. Models include the StingRay, StingRay 5, and Sterling. Introduced in 2018, the Stingray Special series includes revamped versions of the StingRay and StingRay 5 basses with new pickups and an 18-volt preamp. = Recent years = Albert Lee playing his signature model guitar In 1996, Ernie Ball/Music Man began an annual 'Battle of the Bands' contest to spotlight unsigned talent. In 2000, Ernie Ball/Music Man was raided by the copyright lobby group the Business Software Alliance and accused of having unlicensed software installed at its premises. Following a court settlement, the BSA used Ernie Ball/Music Man as an example in advertisements and industry publications; Sterling Ball was so offended at this treatment that he had all Microsoft software removed from Ernie Ball/Music Man (\\"I don't care if we have to buy 10,000 abacuses,\\") and imposed an open-source software policy across the company. In 2001, Sterling Ball decided to institute a higher than minimum wage at the plant. The entry level wage would be $10.10 per hour. One-third of the then-current workforce of 226 people got a raise. He cited the need to attract and retain high quality employees, and the moral responsibility to provide his employees with a decent income. In a New Times interview he said, \\"it's contrary to a lot of traditional business theories, I know, but I did it because it's the right thing to do, fundamentally.\\"  Models  = Basses = Some of the models manufactured by Music-Man are: * StingRay * StingRay 5 * Sterling * Bongo * Cutlass * Caprice * Cutlass II * Sabre * Big Al * Reflex * The Game Changer * SUB * SUB Sterling References External links * Official website * Example of vintage Music Man StingRay bass guitar * Sterling Ball Interview NAMM Oral History Library (2011) Category:Bass guitar manufacturing companies Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States ","title":"Music Man (company)"},{"id":"1125406","text":"Alt or ALT may refer to:  Abbreviations  * Alternate character, in online gaming * Alternate route, type of highway designation * Alternating group, mathematical group of even permutations * Alternative lifestyle * Alternative rock * Altimeter * Altitude  Acronyms  * Alanine transaminase, a liver enzyme of the transaminase family * Alternative lengthening of telomeres, in cellular biology * Approach and Landing Tests, in space transportation * Argon laser trabeculoplasty, a type of glaucoma surgery * Assistant Language Teacher, in Japan * Association for Learning Technology, in Oxford, England * Accelerated life testing, testing a product in excess of its normal service parameters * International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory, a conference in theoretical computer science  Places and geographical features  * Alt, Greater Manchester, formerly a constituent parish of Limehurst Rural District, near Oldham, England * River Alt, in Merseyside, England * Amtrak code for Altoona Transportation Center, Pennsylvania, U.S. * National Rail station code for Altrincham station, in Altrincham, England  People  * Alt (surname) * A.L.T.

There are several definitions of the area, including the Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis metropolitan area and the Milwaukee-Racine-Waukesha combined statistical area. It is the largest metropolitan area in Wisconsin, and the 39th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Definitions thumbLocation of Greater Milwaukee counties: =Metropolitan area= The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Milwaukee Metropolitan area as containing four counties in southeastern Wisconsin: Milwaukee, Waukesha, Washington and Ozaukee. The Metropolitan population of Milwaukee was 1,575,179 in the Census Bureau's 2019 estimate, making it the 39th largest in the United States. The city of Milwaukee is the hub of the metropolitan area. The eastern parts of Racine County, eastern parts of Waukesha County, southern part of Ozaukee County, southeastern part of Washington County, and remainder of Milwaukee County are the most urbanized parts of the outlying counties. The character of the area varies widely. Mequon, Brookfield, and the North Shore (Fox Point, Whitefish Bay, River Hills, Shorewood, Glendale, and Bayside) are more white-collar, while West Milwaukee, West Allis, and St. Francis are more blue-collar. Metro Milwaukee draws commuters from outlying areas such as Madison, Chicago and the Fox Cities. It is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis containing an estimated 54 million people. =Combined statistical area= The Milwaukee‚ÄìRacine‚ÄìWaukesha Combined Statistical Area is made up of the Milwaukee‚ÄìWaukesha‚ÄìWest Allis Metropolitan Statistical Area (Milwaukee, Waukesha, Washington and Ozaukee counties), the Racine Metropolitan Statistical Area (Racine County), the Beaver Dam Micropolitan Statistica Area (Dodge County), the Watertown-Fort Atkinson Micropolitan Area (Jefferson County), and the Whitewater-Elkorn Micropolitan Area (Walworth County) according to the U.S. Census. Updated definitions released in February 2013 added Dodge, Jefferson and Walworth Counties to the Milwaukee CSA. Kenosha, despite being just 32 miles from Milwaukee and 50 miles from Chicago, is included as part of the Chicago CSA, as Kenosha has more residents who commute to the Chicago area. As of the 2019 census estimates, the Milwaukee‚ÄìRacine‚ÄìWaukesha Combined Statistical Area population was 2,047,966, the largest in Wisconsin and the 33rd largest in the United States.

The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) is a state-chartered government agency which serves 28 municipalities in the five counties. At the same time, some in the area see the need for more consolidation in government services. The Kettl Commission and former Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum have supported initiatives to do this. However, full consolidation has been criticized as a means of diluting minority voting power.

Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted to relieve arthritis pain or in some hip fractures. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty or THA) consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely. Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years. The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries. Medical uses Total hip replacement is most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have recently failed. Risks Risks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all joint replacements. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death. Weight loss surgery before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes. =Infection= Infection is one of the most common causes for revision of a total hip replacement, along with loosening and dislocation. The incidence of infection in primary hip replacement is around 1% or less in the United States. Risk factors for infection include obesity, diabetes, smoking, immunosuppressive medications or diseases, and history of infection. Modern diagnosis of infection around a total knee replacement is based on the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. They are: #There is a sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis; or #A pathogen is isolated by culture from at least two separate tissue or fluid samples obtained from the affected prosthetic joint; or Four of the following six criteria exist: #Elevated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR>30mm/hr) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP>10 mg/L) concentration, #Elevated synovial leukocyte count, #Elevated synovial neutrophil percentage (PMN%), #Presence of purulence in the affected joint, #Isolation of a microorganism in one culture of periprosthetic tissue or fluid, or #Greater than five neutrophils per high-power field in five high- power fields observed from histologic analysis of periprosthetic tissue at √ó400 magnification. None of the above laboratory tests has 100% sensitivity or specificity for diagnosing infection. Specificity improves when the tests are performed in patients in whom clinical suspicion exists. ESR and CRP remain good 1st line tests for screening (high sensitivity, low specificity). Aspiration of the joint remains the test with the highest specificity for confirming infection. =Dislocation= Dislocated artificial hip Liner wear, particularly when over 2 mm, increases the risk of dislocation. Liner creep, on the other hand, is normal remoulding. Dislocation is the most common complication of hip replacement surgery. The most common causes vary by the duration since the surgery. Hip prosthesis dislocation mostly occurs in the first three months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues. It takes eight to twelve weeks for the soft tissues injured or cut during surgery to heal. During this period, the hip ball can come out of the socket. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the tissue cut is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used. Dislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles. Risk factors of late dislocation (after five years) mainly include: * Female gender * Younger age at primary hip arthroplasty * Previous subluxation without complete dislocation * Previous trauma * Substantial weight loss * Recent onset or progression of dementia or a neurological disorder * Malposition of the cup * Wear of the liner, particularly when it causes movement of the head of more than 2 mm within the cup compared to its original position * Prosthesis loosening with migration Surgeons who perform more of the operations each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate. Doing the surgery from an anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but the benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions with the use of larger diameter heads. The use of larger diameter head size does in itself decrease the risk of dislocation, even though this correlation is only found in head sizes up to 28 mm, thereafter no additional decrease in dislocation rate is found. People can decrease the risk further by keeping the leg out of certain positions during the first few months after surgery. =Limb length inequality= Most adults prior to a hip replacement have a limb length inequality of 0‚Äì2 cm which they were born with and which causes no deficits. It is common for people to feel a limb length inequality after total hip replacement. Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by 6 months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery (<1 cm) to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre- arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than 6 months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction. =Fracture= Intraoperative acetabular fracture. Intraoperative fractures may occur. After surgery, bones with internal fixation devices in situ are at risk of periprosthetic fractures at the end of the implant, an area of relative mechanical stress. Post-operative femoral fractures are graded by the Vancouver classification. =Vein thrombosis= Venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with anticoagulants is for 7‚Äì10 days; however treatment for more than 21 days may be superior. Extended-duration anticoagulants (up to 35 days following surgery) may prevent VTE in people undergoing hip replacement surgery. Research from 2013 has on the other hand suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so- called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, might only be necessary while in the hospital. Some physicians and patients may consider having an ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis after hip replacement., which cites * However, this kind of screening should only be done when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are sometimes used for prevention of blood clots following total hip replacement. While there are a variety of different devices, it is currently unclear whether one is more effective than another. =Osteolysis= Many long-term problems with hip replacements are the result of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them. =Loosening= Hip prosthesis displaying aseptic loosening (arrows) Hip prosthesis zones according to DeLee and Charnley, and Gruen. These are used to describe the location of for example areas of loosening. On radiography, it is normal to see thin radiolucent areas of less than 2 mm around hip prosthesis components, or between a cement mantle and bone. However, these may still indicate loosening of the prosthesis if they are new or changing, and areas greater than 2 mm may be harmless if they are stable. The most important prognostic factors of cemented cups are absence of radiolucent lines in DeLee and Charnley zone I, as well as adequate cement mantle thickness. In the first year after insertion of uncemented femoral stems, it is normal to have mild subsidence (less than 10 mm). The direct anterior approach has been shown to itself be a risk factor for early femoral component loosening. =Metal sensitivity= Concerns are being raised about the metal sensitivity and potential dangers of metal particulate debris. New publications have demonstrated development of pseudotumors, soft tissue masses containing necrotic tissue, around the hip joint. It appears these masses are more common in women and these patients show a higher level of iron in the blood. The cause is unknown and is probably multifactorial. There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a normal amount of metal debris. Metal hypersensitivity is a well- established phenomenon and is common, affecting about 10‚Äì15% of the population. Contact with metals can cause immune reactions such as skin hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although little is known about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of immunologic type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components. Individual case reports link hypersensitivity immune reactions with adverse performance of metallic clinical cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants. =Metal toxicity= Most hip replacements consist of cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel is no longer used. All implants release their constituent ions into the blood. Typically these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of cobalt and chromium can be absorbed into the person's bloodstream. There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement, particularly metal-on-metal hip replacements, which are no longer in use. Use of metal on metal hip replacements from the 1970's were discontinued in the 1980s, and 1990s, particularly after the discovery of aseptic lymphocyte- dominant vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL). The FDA's 510k approval process, allowed companies to get new and 'improved' metal on metal hips approved without much clinical testing. Again, some with these hips are experiencing the same reactions to the metal debris and some devices have been recalled, like the DePuy ASR. =Nerve palsy= Post operative sciatic nerve palsy is another possible complication. The incidence of this complication is low. Femoral nerve palsy is another but much more rare complication. Both of these will typically resolve over time, but the healing process is slow. Patients with pre-existing nerve injury are at greater risk of experiencing this complication and are also slower to recover. =Chronic pain= A few patients who have had a hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made in the front of the hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma). =Death= The rate of perioperative mortality for elective hip replacements is significantly less than 1%.Medscape Conference Coverage, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2009 Annual Meeting, AAOS 2009: Certain Factors Increase Risk for Death After Total Hip Arthroplasty, Barbara Boughton, March 3, 2009. =Metal-on-metal hip implant failure= By 2010, reports in the orthopaedic literature increasingly cited the problem of early failure of metal on metal prostheses in a small percentage of patients. Failures may relate to release of minute metallic particles or metal ions from wear of the implants, causing pain and disability severe enough to require revision surgery in 1‚Äì3% of patients. Design deficits of some prothesis models, especially with heat-treated alloys and a lack of special surgical experience accounting for most of the failures. In 2010, surgeons at medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic reported reducing their use of metal-on-metal implants by 80 percent over the previous year in favor of those made from other materials, like combinations of metal and plastic. The cause of these failures remain controversial, and may include both design factors, technique factors, and factors related to patient immune responses (allergy type reactions). In the United Kingdom the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency commenced an annual monitoring regime for metal-on-metal hip replacement patients from May 2010. Data which are shown in The Australian Orthopaedic Association's 2008 National Joint replacement registry, a record of nearly every hip implanted in that country over the previous 10 years, tracked 6,773 BHR (Birmingham Hip Resurfacing) Hips and found that less than 0.33% may have been revised due to the patient's reaction to the metal component.Table HT 46. Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry Annual Report. Adelaide: AOA; 2008 Other similar metal- on-metal designs have not fared as well, where some reports show 76% to 100% of the people with these metal-on-metal implants and have aseptic implant failures requiring revision also have evidence of histological inflammation accompanied by extensive lymphocyte infiltrates, characteristic of delayed type hypersensitivity responses. It is not clear to what extent this phenomenon negatively affects orthopedic patients. However, for patients presenting with signs of an allergic reactions, evaluation for sensitivity should be conducted. Removal of the device that is not needed should be considered, since removal may alleviate the symptoms. Patients who have allergic reactions to cheap jewelry are more likely to have reactions to orthopedic implants. There is increasing awareness of the phenomenon of metal sensitivity and many surgeons now take this into account when planning which implant is optimal for each patient. On March 12, 2012, The Lancet published a study, based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales, finding that metal-on-metal hip implants failed at much greater rates than other types of hip implants and calling for a ban on all metal-on-metal hips. The analysis of 402,051 hip replacements showed that 6.2% of metal-on-metal hip implants had failed within five years, compared to 1.7% of metal-on- plastic and 2.3% of ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. Each increase in head size of metal-on-metal hip implants was associated with a 2% increase of failure. Surgeons of the British Hip Society are recommending that large head metal-on-metal implants should no longer be performed. On February 10, 2011, the U.S. FDA issued an advisory on metal-metal hip implants, stating it was continuing to gather and review all available information about metal-on-metal hip systems. On June 27‚Äì28, 2012, an advisory panel met to decide whether to impose new standards, taking into account findings of the study in The Lancet. No new standards, such as routine checking of blood metal ion levels, were set, but guidance was updated. Currently, FDA has not required hip implants to be tested in clinical trials before they can be sold in the U.S. Instead, companies making new hip implants only need to prove that they are \\"substantially equivalent\\" to other hip implants already on the market. The exception is metal-on-metal implants, which were not tested in clinical trials but because of the high revision rate of metal-on-metal hips, in the future the FDA has stated that clinical trials will be required for approval and that post-market studies will be required to keep metal on metal hip implants on the market. Modern process Main components of a hip prosthesis A titanium hip prosthesis, with a ceramic head and polyethylene acetabular cup The modern artificial joint owes much to the 1962 work of Sir John Charnley at Wrightington Hospital. His work in the field of tribology resulted in a design that almost completely replaced the other designs by the 1970s. Charnley's design consisted of three parts: # stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head # polyethylene (originally Teflon), acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using # PMMA (acrylic) bone cement The replacement joint, which was known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head () was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants. The Exeter hip stem was developed in the United Kingdom during the same time as the Charnley device. Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon Robin Ling and University of Exeter engineer Clive Lee and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970. The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions. Early implant designs had the potential to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved. Initial hip designs were made of a one-piece femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials. To combat loosening caused by polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel materials for the acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE was introduced in the late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery. When currently available implants are used, cemented stems tend to have a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems. Techniques There are several incisions, defined by their relation to the gluteus medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool), antero- lateral (Watson-Jones), anterior (Smith-Petersen) and greater trochanter osteotomy. There is no compelling evidence in the literature for any particular approach. =Posterior approach= The posterior (Moore or Southern) approach accesses the joint and capsule through the back, taking piriformis muscle and the short external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip abductors and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It has the advantage of becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk. Limited evidence suggests that the posterior approach may cause less nerve damage. =Lateral approach= The lateral approach is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires elevation of the hip abductors (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat. = Antero-lateral approach = The anterolateral approach develops the interval between the tensor fasciae latae and the gluteus medius. The Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after the replacement of the joint. = Anterior approach = The anterior approach uses an interval between the sartorius muscle and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems that had a small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to surgery performed through a posterior approach. With modern implant designs, dislocation rates are similar between the anterior and posterior approaches. The anterior approach has been shown in studies to variably improve early functional recovery, with possible complications of femoral component loosening and early revision compared to other approaches = Minimally invasive approaches = The dual incision approach and other minimally invasive surgery seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing the size of the incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures can be significantly impaired as the approaches get smaller. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. The majority of current orthopedic surgeons use a \\"minimally invasive\\" approach compared to traditional approaches which were quite large comparatively. Computer-assisted surgery and robotic surgery techniques are also available to guide the surgeon to provide enhanced accuracy. Several commercial CAS and robotic systems are available for use worldwide. Improved patient outcomes and reduced complications have not been demonstrated when these systems are used when compared to standard techniques. Implants Metal on metal prosthetic hip Cement-free implant sixteen days after surgery. Femoral component is cobalt chromium combined with titanium which induces bone growth into the implant. Ceramic head. Acetabular cup coated with bone growth-inducing material and held temporarily in place with a single screw. The prosthetic implant used in hip replacement consists of three parts: the acetabular cup, the femoral component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence for a number of newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups. Correct selection of the prosthesis is important. =Acetabular cup= The acetabular cup is the component which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone are removed from the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is held in place by a metal coating on the outside of the cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under- reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper. =Femoral component= The femoral component is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped to accept the femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There are two types of fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted. =Articular interface= The articular interface is not part of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining tolerances at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are , and . While was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54 mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled to reduce the amount of wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages. Dual mobility hip replacements reduce the risk of dislocation. Configuration Post-operative projectional radiography is routinely performed to ensure proper configuration of hip prostheses. The direction of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation. For this purpose, the acetabular inclination and the acetabular anteversion are measurements of cup angulation in the coronal plane and the sagittal plane, respectively. File:Acetabular inclination of hip prosthesis.jpgAcetabular inclination. This parameter is calculated on an anteroposterior radiograph as the angle between a line through the lateral and medial margins of the acetabular cup and the transischial line which is tangential to the inferior margins of the ischium bones. File:Range of acetabular inclination.pngAcetabular inclination is normally between 30 and 50¬∞. A larger angle increases the risk of dislocation. File:Acetabular anteversion of hip prosthesis.jpgAcetabular anteversion. This parameter is calculated on a lateral radiograph as the angle between the transverse plane and a line going through the (anterior and posterior) margins of the acetabular cup. File:Range of acetabular anteversion.pngAcetabular anteversion is normally between 5 and 25¬∞. An anteversion below or above this range increases the risk of dislocation. There is an intra-individual variability in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the transverse plane. File:Leg length discrepancy after hip replacement.jpgLeg length discrepancy after hip replacement is calculated as the vertical distance between the middle of the minor trochanters, using the acetabular tear drops or the transischial line as references for the horizontal plane. A discrepancy of up to 1 cm is generally tolerated. File:Center of rotation of hip prosthesis.jpgCenter of rotation: The horizontal center of rotation is calculated as the distance between the acetabular teardrop and the center of the head (or caput) of the prosthesis and/or the native femoral head on the contralateral side. The vertical center of rotation instead uses the transischial line for reference. The parameter should be equal on both sides. Alternatives and variations =Conservative management= The first line approach as an alternative to hip replacement is conservative management which involves a multimodal approach of oral medication, injections, activity modification and physical therapy. Conservative management can prevent or delay the need for hip replacement. = Preoperative care = Preoperative education is currently an important part of patient care. There is some evidence that it may slightly reduce anxiety before hip or knee replacement, with low risk of negative effects. =Hemiarthroplasty= Femoral (neck) offset is defined as the perpendicular distance between the intramedullary or longitudinal axis of the femur and the center of rotation of the native or prosthetic femoral head. An offset of less than 33 mm is associated with hip dislocation. Hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure which replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after an intracapsular fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because with the passage of time the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum. Independently mobile older adults with hip fractures may benefit from a total hip replacement instead of hemiarthroplasty. File:Bipolar hip prosthesis.jpgHip prosthesis for hemiarthroplasty. This example is bipolar, meaning that the head has two separate articulations. File:X-ray of hips with a hemiarthroplasty.jpgX-ray of the hips, with a right-sided hemiarthroplasty. =Hip resurfacing= Hip resurfacing is an alternative to hip replacement surgery. It has been used in Europe for over seventeen years and become a common procedure. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty. The minimally invasive hip resurfacing procedure is a further refinement to hip resurfacing. =Viscosupplementation= Current alternatives also include viscosupplementation, or the injection of artificial lubricants into the joint. Use of these medications in the hip is off label. The cost of treatment is typically not covered by health insurance organizations. Some believe that the future of osteoarthritis treatment is bioengineering, targeting the growth and/or repair of the damaged, arthritic joint. Centeno et al. have reported on the partial regeneration of an arthritic human hip joint using mesenchymal stem cells in one patient. It is yet to be shown that this result will apply to a larger group of patients and result in significant benefits. The FDA has stated that this procedure is being practiced without conforming to regulations, but Centeno claims that it is exempt from FDA regulation. It has not been shown in controlled clinical trials to be effective, and costs over $7,000. Prevalence and cost Total hip replacement incidence varies in developed countries between 30 (Romania) and 290 (Germany) procedures per 100,000 population per year. Approximately 0.8% of Americans have undergone the procedure. According to the International Federation of Healthcare Plans, the average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, $11,889 in the United Kingdom, $10,987 in France, $9,574 in Switzerland, and $7,731 in Spain. In the United States, the average cost of a total hip replacement varies widely by geographic region, ranging from $11,327 (Birmingham, Alabama) to $73,927 (Boston, Massachusetts). History The earliest recorded attempts at hip replacement were carried out in Germany in 1891 by Themistocles Gluck (1853‚Äì1942), who used ivory to replace the femoral head (the ball on the femur), attaching it with nickel-plated screws, plaster of Paris, and glue. On September 28, 1940 at Columbia Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina, American surgeon Dr. Austin T. Moore (1899‚Äì1963) performed the first metallic hip replacement surgery. The original prosthesis he designed was a proximal femoral replacement, with a large fixed head made of the cobalt-chrome alloy Vitallium. It was about a foot in length and bolted to the resected end of the femoral shaft (hemiarthroplasty). A later version, the so-called Austin Moore Prosthesis which was introduced in 1952, is still in use today, although rarely. Like modern hip implants, it is inserted into the medullary canal of the femur, and depends on bone growth through a hole in the stem for long-term attachment.

While they are a form of neoplasm, there is disagreement over whether CIS should be classified as cancer. This controversy also depends on the exact CIS in question (i.e. cervical, skin, breast). Some authors do not classify them as cancer, however, recognizing that they can potentially become cancer. Others classify certain types as a non-invasive form of cancer. The term \\"pre-cancer\\" has also been used. These abnormal cells grow in their normal place, thus \\"in situ\\" (from Latin for \\"in its place\\"). For example, carcinoma in situ of the skin, also called Bowen's disease, is the accumulation of dysplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only, that has failed to penetrate into the deeper dermis. For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumor. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc.) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc.). Exceptions include CIS of the colon (polyps), the bladder (preinvasive papillary cancer), or the breast (ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ). Many forms of CIS have a high probability of progression into cancer,Ridge JA, Glisson BS, Lango MN, et al. \\"Head and Neck Tumors\\" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11 ed. 2008. and therefore removal may be recommended; however, progression of CIS is known to be highly variable and not all CIS becomes invasive cancer. In the TNM classification, carcinoma in situ is reported as TisN0M0 (stage 0). Terminology These terms are related since they represent the steps of the progression toward cancer: *Dysplasia is the earliest form of precancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Dysplasia can be low-grade or high-grade. High-grade dysplasia may also be referred to as carcinoma in situ. *Invasive carcinoma, usually simply called cancer, has the potential to invade and spread to surrounding tissues and structures, and may eventually be lethal. Examples High-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) in the uterine cervix: The abnormal epithelium is extending into a mucous gland to the left of center. This disease can progress to invasive cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) of the cervix. * Cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), previously called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), is a form of dysplasia that can progress to cervical cancer. The term carcinoma in situ may be used interchangeably with high-grade SIL. * Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast is the most common precancer in women. * Bowen's disease is a squamous carcinoma in situ of the skin. * Colon polyps often contain areas of CIS that will almost always transform into colon cancer if left untreated. * High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is equivalent to CIS of the prostate. * Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) of the lung is the only form of CIS that can kill directly because, in rare cases (the \\"pneumonic form\\"), it expands greatly and fills the lungs, preventing breathing and causing other dire effects on the host. Thus, the pneumonic form of BAC is a true malignant entity, but is not \\"invasive\\" in the classical sense. For this reason, it is considered a form of CIS by pathologists, but not by oncologists or surgeons, and inclusion of this form of cancer among the types of CIS is controversial. Treatment Carcinoma in situ is, by definition, a localized phenomenon, with no potential for metastasis unless it progresses into cancer. Therefore, its removal eliminates the risk of subsequent progression into a life- threatening condition. Some forms of CIS (e.g., colon polyps and polypoid tumours of the bladder) can be removed using an endoscope, without conventional surgical resection.

Marks is mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants in sections 117 and 124 of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) edition and in section 115 of the Community of Christ edition. Marks was born in Rutland, Vermont to Cornwall (or Cornell) Marks and Sarah Goodrich. He married Rosannah Robinson on May 2, 1813 and was the father of five children. Early church membership Marks was baptized a member of Church of the Latter Day Saints sometime in April 1835 in New York and ordained a priest shortly thereafter. He was ordained an Elder on June 3, 1836. Partly due to the lack of records available on his baptism, Marks was re-baptized in proxy by the LDS Church on January 29, 1965. In September 1837, Marks was appointed to the High Council at Kirtland, Ohio and agent of the Messenger and Advocate when Joseph Smith and others fled Ohio under mob pressure. Marks was appointed by revelation (D&C; 117) to leave Ohio and move to Far West, Missouri, to preside over the body of Saints. However, before he arrived, the Mormons were expelled from the state under the \\"Extermination Order\\" signed into law by Lilburn W. Boggs. Marks was also seen in vision by Joseph Smith, according to Smith‚Äôs own record on March 29, 1838. Smith wrote that he saw Marks: \\"... closely pursued by an innumerable concourse of enemies, who pressed upon him hard; and when they were about to devour him, and had seemingly obtained some degree of advantage over him, a chariot of fire came, and near the place, even the angel of the Lord, put forth his hand upon Bro. Marks and said unto him: 'Thou art my son, come here.' And immediately he was caught up in the chariot and rode away triumphantly out of their midst. And again the Lord said, 'I will raise thee up for a blessing unto many people.'\\"Millennial Star, Volume 16, page 131. Leadership in Nauvoo When the Saints arrived in Commerce, Illinois in 1839, Marks was appointed as Stake President of Commerce (later Stake President of the Nauvoo Stake of Zion). He served in that position until 1844. He was also elected as a Nauvoo municipal alderman and as one of the regents of the University of the City of Nauvoo in February 1841, and was a founder of the Nauvoo Agricultural and Manufacturing Association. He was appointed by revelation (D&C; 124) to contribute to and be on the Nauvoo House committee, and served as landlord of the Mansion House. As Stake President, he assisted in the laying of the cornerstones of the Nauvoo Temple in April, 1841, was initiated into Masonry in April 1842 and received his endowment on May 4, 1842 as a member of the Council of Fifty. Although a close friend of Joseph Smith, Marks occasionally found himself at odds with the prophet. Smith presented evidence of why Sidney Rigdon should be rejected as first counselor in the First Presidency of the church during the October 1843 General Conference. He accused Rigdon, the long-time friend of Marks, as having lost his \\"integrity and steadfastness\\" and stated that he had no confidence in Rigdon's abilities as a leader in the church or as his counselor. Regardless of these accusations Marks motioned that Rigdon remain in his station as a counselor in the First Presidency. Rigdon was sustained to the position by the membership of the church. After the vote, Smith stood and stated, \\"I have thrown him off my shoulders and you have again put him on me, you may carry him, but I will not.\\"History, 1838‚Äì1856, volume E-1 [1 July 1843‚Äì30 April 1844], p. 1749. Because Rigdon was rejected by Smith, most of the core leadership of the church, including members of the Council of Fifty and Anointed Quorum, questioned Rigdon's standing and authority and later, his claim to succeed Smith as head of the church. Rigdon and Marks were also known opponents of plural marriage. Those who supported this controversial practice instituted by Smith saw such dissent as disloyal. Smith also spoke at the funeral of Marks's son. Among his remarks he said: :\\"I never felt more solemn. It calls to mind the death of my oldest brother [Alvin], who died in New York, and my youngest brother, [Don] Carloss Smith who died in Nauvoo‚Ä¶. It will be but a short time before we shall all in like manner be called. It may be the case with me as well as you. Some have supposed that Br[other] Joseph could not die, but this is a mistake. It is true there ha[ve] been times when I have had the promise of my life to accomplish such-and-such things, but, having accomplish[ed] those things, I have not at present any lease [on] my life. I am as liable to die as other men.\\"Recorded by Wilford Woodruff. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, eds., The Words of Joseph Smith: The Contemporary Accounts of the Nauvoo Discourses of the Prophet Joseph (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980), p. 112. (Edited for spelling and punctuation.) This funerary sermon is considered one of the most introspective and emotionally depressed discourses by Smith, and pointed to by Mormons as foreknowledge of, and a prophecy of his own death which occurred not long thereafter. In the weeks before Joseph Smith's death, Marks claimed that Joseph came to him and told him that plural marriage had proved a curse rather than a blessing to the church. Smith wanted to take decisive steps to end the practice, but time ran out, related Marks. Other purported pieces of evidence, such as Joseph's burning of the polygamy revelation and destroying his temple garments, seem to support Marks's story. Not all members of the church hierarchy believed Marks's testimony, though Quinn believes that Brigham Young gave credence to it, as he later said that if Joseph \\"had followed the Spirit of revelation in him he never would have gone to Carthage\\". In addition, Young would also state that Smith had wearied of polygamous marriage by the time of his death. Ironically, Joseph Smith III later would not believe Marks, either, since Marks implicated Joseph Smith III's father in polygamy.Launius, Joseph Smith III: Pragmatic Prophet, p. 199 Issues with apostolic succession At the time of the death of Joseph Smith, much of the leadership of the church was campaigning for Smith‚Äôs candidacy for President of the United States. Marks, as landlord of the Nauvoo Mansion, oversaw some of the funerary preparations for the burial of Joseph and his brother Hyrum. According to William Clayton's diary, Emma Smith supported Marks as the successor to her husband, the now deceased Joseph Smith. According to Emma, Marks had a right to church succession as the High Council President, which she asserted was equal in authority to the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency. Furthermore, she felt that while apostles had authority in unorganized parts of the church, they did not have authority in the stake of Zion, Nauvoo. This reasoning was one of many interpretations put forward by various factions in the months after Smith's death. Historian D. Michael Quinn claims that despite the foregoing, church succession in Nauvoo revolved around one central issue: plural marriage. Quinn maintains that Marks' known opposition to plural marriage was a crucial issue, and that although a small group of church leaders almost approved Marks as the next church president by July 10, 1844, Elder Willard Richards‚Äîone the Church's Twelve Apostles‚Äîdelayed all action until Quorum President Brigham Young returned from the presidential campaign. Young and the majority of the Quorum of the Twelve, Quinn asserts, feared that Marks would end plural marriage and other ordinances that they saw as crucial to exaltation in the afterlife. Quinn states that despite Emma's support, and despite receiving his endowments and anointings before any other successor claimants (including every member of the Quorum of Twelve), Marks did not advance his own claims to church leadership. Instead, Marks sympathized with Sidney Rigdon and supported his bid to become \\"guardian\\" of the church. Because of this and because he did not support the Twelve Apostles, Marks was removed from the High Council at the October General Conference in 1844, and also rejected as president of the Nauvoo Stake of Zion. Patriarch John Smith, an uncle of Joseph's, was chosen as Marks's successor. Despite Brigham Young's desire to see Marks excommunicated, the Nauvoo High Council refused his request. Marks remained un-excommunicated for the remainder of his life. After several opponents of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles were terrorized by Nauvoo policemen, William Marks left Nauvoo in February 1845. Brigham Young observed that \\"Bro. Marks had gone without being whittled out\\"‚Äîa reference to a tactic of surrounding an opponent with adult men who whistled and whittled without saying a word to the opponent. Young and Marks would never be reconciled after this. RLDS involvement After the exodus of Young's followers to Utah, Marks became convinced that Sidney Rigdon‚Äôs claims of leadership were unfounded and he joined the Strangite movement, later becoming a counselor to James Strang in the Strangite First Presidency. Marks left the Strangites between 1853 and 1855, loosely affiliating himself with other Latter Day Saint denominations. During this time he associated with Zenas H. Gurley, Jason W. Briggs and William W. Blair. The four were convinced that succession in the presidency of the church must be lineal, descending from father to son, and promoted the idea of a Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Between 1853 and 1859 they approached Joseph Smith III dozens of times to convince him to take leadership of the RLDS movement, which Smith III eventually did. On June 11, 1859, Marks was formally received as a member of the RLDS movement without re-baptism. With Gurley he presided over the conference in April 1860 where he aided Gurley in ordaining Joseph Smith III as president of the high priesthood in the newly incorporated Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. According to Joseph Smith III in March 1863 \\"a revelation was received directing the church to call and ordain William Marks to be a Counselor to the President of the church, in order that the Quorum [of the First Presidency] might be more perfectly prepared to discharge the duties devolving upon it.\\" This revelation was presented to the April 1863 General Conference of the RLDS Church and canonized as Doctrine and Covenants Section 115. Marks' ordination took place at the same conference, joining Joseph Smith III and Jason W. Briggs in the RLDS First Presidency. In 1866, Marks was appointed to the committee to receive manuscripts from the Joseph Smith‚Äôs widow‚ÄîEmma Smith Bidamon‚Äîand print the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. Marks was first counselor in the First Presidency of the Reorganized Church when he died in Plano, Illinois on May 22, 1872. A marked grave bearing his name is located in the Shabbona Grove Cemetery at Shabbona Grove, DeKalb, Illinois, adjacent to that of his wife Rosannah Robinson Marks, who died on October 18, 1862. Marks had married a second time in 1866 to Julia Ann Durfee, who survived him.

He was Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation in the Scullin Government from 1929 to 1931. Early life Anstey was born in London, England, the son of an iron-miner, who died five months before he was born, and he had little formal education. He stowed away on a passenger ship when he was 11 and arrived in Melbourne in 1877. He then spent ten years working on ships to the South Pacific islands. After spending a period as an itinerant worker (a \\"swaggie\\" in Australian slang), he moved to Sale, where he met Katherine Mary Bell McColl. They married in 1887 and had two sons. He became a cleaner in Melbourne, where he soon became involved in politics. He worked on the Melbourne tramways and became President of the Tramways Employees Union. Self-educated, he wrote extensively for Labor newspapers such as The Tocsin and Labor Call. Political career In 1902 Anstey was elected as a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for East Bourke Boroughs, and from 1904 he was member for Brunswick, both electorates being in the working-class suburbs of Melbourne. He switched to federal politics at the 1910 election, winning the seat of Bourke in the House of Representatives. Despite his English birth, Anstey was an Australian nationalist. He saw Australia as an economic colony of the finance houses of the City of London, which, like many in the labour movement at this time, he described as the \\"money power\\". His views are typified by this passage from a 1907 editorial in the newspaper of the Australian Workers' Union: In 1914 Australia, under the Labor government of Andrew Fisher, entered the First World War on the side of Britain. Anstey was one of the few Labor members who opposed the war from the start, and as a result he was highly unpopular for a time. By 1917, however, anti-war sentiment was growing and Anstey became one of the leaders of the movement against conscription for the war. Frank Anstey Anstey published a book called The Kingdom of Shylock, in which he described the \\"money power\\" which he said controlled and manipulated capitalism from behind the scenes. \\"London is, so far, the web centre of international finance,\\" he wrote. \\"In London are assembled the actual chiefs or the representatives of the great financial houses of the world. The Money Power is something more than Capitalism. These men constitute the Financial Oligarchy. No nation can be really free where this financial oligarchy is permitted to hold dominion, and no 'democracy' can be aught but a name that does not shake it from its throne.\\" Anstey described this system as the \\"Black Masonic Plutocracy\\": \\"These men constitute the Financial Oligarchy, this group of speculators properly designated and distinguished as the Money Power, controls the whole mechanism of exchange, and all undertakings in the field of industry are subject to its will and machinations. It wields an unseen sceptre over thrones and populations, and bloody slaughter is as profitable to its pockets as the most peaceful peculation.\\" Front cover of The Kingdom of Shylock, an antisemitic pamphlet by Frank Anstey as M.P.\\"In The Kingdom of Shylock Anstey identified the leaders of the \\"money power\\" in London as a group of private financiers associated with the circles of the Morgan family in the United States. \\"After Medina came the Jew, Manasseh Lopes,\\" Anstey wrote. \\"Then came Samson Gideon and the Goldsmids ‚Äì Abraham and Benjamin. They were succeeded by the Rothschilds.\\" The fact that some of Anstey's prominent targets were Jewish has caused critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. The Australian labour historian Peter Love writes: \\"The anti-Semitism in The Kingdom of Shylock was no aberration. It arose from the logic of his [Anstey's] analysis combined with the cultural tradition of which he was a part. The vulgarities of Christian mythology had built up an accretion of hatred and suspicion towards Jews over many centuries. The resulting stereotype of the greedy and cunning Jewish financier was a commonplace convention in the writings of British radicals and American populists. It was also a persistent theme among Australian labour radicals.P. Love, The kingdom of Shylock: a case study of Australian labour anti-semitism, AJHSJ, Vol. 12 (1) 1993, pp. 54‚Äì62. In 1922 Anstey became Assistant Leader of the ALP in the House, a post he held until 1926. An early photograph of Frank Anstey =Scullin Government= Anstey in 1939 Following Labor's win at the 1929 election, Anstey became Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation in the government of Prime Minister James Scullin. But Scullin's government soon fell victim to the Great Depression. Anstey supported the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, who advocated repudiating Australia's debts to British bondholders (see debt moratorium) and using the funds to create employment in order to increase production. This may be compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"New Deal.\\" In March 1931 Anstey was dumped from the Ministry by the Labor Caucus for supporting the \\"Lang Plan\\". Despite this, Anstey did not follow Lang out of the Labor Party. Demoralized and cynical, he stayed on the backbench until his retirement at the 1934 election, when he and his wife moved to Sydney. After his wife's death he moved back to Melbourne, where he died of cancer. Ironically, he had devoted his last years to financial speculation and had become a wealthy man. Legacy Anstey is principally remembered as the mentor of John Curtin, on whom he had a great influence in Curtin's early years. Like Curtin, he was a heavy drinker. He wrote extensive unpublished memoirs, but burned them shortly before his death. It is often rumoured that he burned them in a drunken rage, but this is unsubstantiated. Frank Hardy wrote in his book The Hard Way that Frank Anstey received a visit from John Wren (immortalised as \\"John West\\" in Hardy's other book Power Without Glory), who asked Anstey to eradicate any reference to him in Anstey's memoirs, to prevent them from becoming an expos√© of Wren's gambling empire. Anstey railway station in Melbourne was named in Anstey's honour.

Blackletter (also known as Gothic) and its variation Rotunda, gradually developed from the Carolingian hand during the 12th century. Over the next three centuries, the scribes in northern Europe used an ever more compressed and spiky form of Gothic. Those in Italy and Spain preferred the rounder but still heavy-looking Rotunda. During the 15th century, Italian scribes returned to the Roman and Carolingian models of writing and designed the Italic hand, also called Chancery cursive, and Roman bookhand. These three hands ‚Äî Gothic, Italic, and Roman bookhand ‚Äî became the models for printed letters. Johannes Gutenberg used Gothic to print his famous Bible, but the lighter-weight Italic and Roman bookhand have since become the standard. During the Middle Ages, hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were produced:http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/collections/illuminated/ some illuminated with gold and fine painting, some illustrated with line drawings, and some just textbooks.Kerr 2006; Alexander 2005; de Hamel 2001b & 1992; Wieck 1983 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, administration in the states of Western Europe became more centralised. Paper was again widely available in Europe, which allowed a bureaucracy with standardized bookkeeping. In late medieval England, this led to the development of the Chancery Standard of Late Middle English, along with new forms of standardised calligraphy used for the production of legal or official documents. By the mid-15th century, Chancery Standard was used for most official purposes except by the Church, which still used Latin, and for some legal purposes, for which Law French and some Latin were used. It was disseminated around England by bureaucrats on official business and slowly gained prestige. The production of finalized, calligraphic copies of documents in Chancery hand came to be known as \\"engrossing\\", from Anglo-French engrosser (Old French en gros \\"in large (letters)\\"). In the late 1490s and early 1500s, the early printer Richard Pynson favored Chancery Standard in his published works, and consequently pushed the English spelling further towards standardization. =Early Modern era= Page of initials from Stephanus Hayn's notebook (1775) In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher. The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the coul√©e, the rhonde, (known as Round hand in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the bastarda. While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published Les Ecritures Financi√®re Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel circa 1650. With the destruction of the Camera Apostolica during the sack of Rome (1527), the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France. By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery Circumflessa, which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English Roundhand. In England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned. =Modern revival= Edward Johnston, founder of modern calligraphy, at work in 1902. After printing became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline.de Hamel 2001a; de Hamel 1986 However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.Zapf 2007; de Hamel 2001a; Gilderdale 1999; Gray 1971 The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Edward Johnston is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy.Cockerell 1945; Morris 1882 After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, he was introduced to William Lethaby in 1898, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, who advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum.such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904 This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in Southampton Row, London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. He was commissioned by Frank Pick to design a new typeface for London Underground, still used today (with minor modifications).The Eric Gill Society: Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston He has been credited for reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, Writing & Illuminating, & Lettering (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Stanley Morison, Eric Gill, Alfred Fairbank and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the Foundational hand, although Johnston never used the terms \\"Foundational\\" or \\"Foundational Hand\\". Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.Gilderdale 1999 He first referred to this hand as \\"Foundational Hand\\" in his 1909 publication, Manuscript & Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen.Baines & Dixon 2003: 81 =20th century= Graily Hewitt taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Hewitt helped to found the Society of Scribes & Illuminators (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society. An example of Graily Hewitt's calligraphy. Hewitt is not without both criticsTresser 2006 and supportersWhitley 2000: 90 in his rendering of Cennino Cennini's medieval gesso recipes.Herringham 1899 Donald Jackson, a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.Jackson 1981: 81 Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to Prince Philip of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.Hewitt 1944-1953 Johnston‚Äôs pupil, Anna Simons, was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering in 1910. Austrian Rudolf Larisch, a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles. Rudolf Koch was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably Karlgeorg Hoefer, and Hermann Zapf.Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991 Modern calligraphy Modern western calligraphy (Denis Brown, 2006) Calligraphy of the German word Urkunde (\\"deed, certificate\\"; Manuel Strehl, 2004) Calligraphy today finds diverse applications. These include graphic design, logo design, type design, paintings, scholarship, maps, menus, greeting cards, invitations, legal documents, diplomas, cut stone inscriptions, memorial documents, props and moving images for film and television, business cards, and handmade presentations. Many calligraphers make their livelihood in the addressing of envelopes and invitations for public and private events including wedding stationery. Entry points exist for both children and adults via classes and instruction books. The scope of the calligraphic art is more than pure antiquarian interest.Zapf 2007; Mediavilla 1996; Child 1988, 1976 & 1963; International Typeface Corporation 1982 Johnston's legacy remains pivotal to the ambitions of perhaps most Western calligraphers: > ‚ÄúIt is possible even now to go back to the child's - something like the > early calligrapher's - point of view, and this is the only healthy one for > any fine beginning: to this nothing can be added; all Rules must give way to > Truth and Freedom.‚ÄùJohnston 1909: contents page The multimillion-dollar Saint John's Bible project for the 21st century, completed in 2011, had engaged Donald Jackson with an international scriptorium. It is designed as a 21st-century illuminated Bible, executed with both ancient and modern tools and techniques. The earlier 20th-century \\"Bulley Bible\\" was executed by a student of Edward Johnston's, Edward Bulley.Green 2003 The digital era has facilitated the creation and dissemination of thousands of new and historically styled fonts. Calligraphy gives unique expression to every individual letterform within a design layout which is not the strength of typeface technologies no matter their sophistication.Zapf 2007: 76-7; Thomson 2004 versus Prestianni 2001 The usefulness of the digital medium to the calligrapher is not limited to the computer layout of the new Saint John's Bible prior to working by hand.Calderhead 2005 Graphics tablets facilitate calligraphic design work more than large size art pieces.Thomson 2004 The internet supports a number of online communities of calligraphers and hand lettering artists.

It is 20% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 40 proof. Formerly, it was 24% ABV or 48 proof. When produced by the Barbaro family it was bottled at 28% ABV or 56 proof. The brand was created in 1978. It is known for its unusual packaging; its bottle was designed to look like a Christian friar, complete with a knotted white cord around the waist. It is most commonly sold in two sizes: 750ml and 375ml. According to the manufacturer, the name of the liqueur is based on a legend of a hermit monk named Fra Angelico who \\"created unique recipes for liqueurs\\". The bottle itself most closely resembles the habit of a Franciscan friar. Frangelico is made in a similar manner to some other nut liqueurs: nuts are crumbled up and combined with cocoa, vanilla berries, and other natural flavors, and then left to soak in the base spirit. After the spirit has absorbed the flavor of the ingredients, the liqueur is filtered, sweetened, and bottled. The brand was purchased by Gruppo Campari in 2010, having previously been owned by William Grant and C&C; Group. Ingredients Frangelico contains: Sugar, alcohol, hazelnut distillate, natural and artificial flavours, caramel. A serving of Frangelico contains about 11 g of sugar, making Frangelico approximately 40% sugar by weight. Reviews Frangelico has been submitted to at least three spirit ratings organizations. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the Beverage Testing Institute, and Wine Enthusiast have generally awarded favorable reviews to the spirit. Proof66, which aggregates ratings information from the expert review bodies, categorizes Frangelico as a \\"Tier 1\\" spirit, which places it in its \\"Highly Recommended\\" category. Appearances in media The artist Jeff Koons reproduced two Frangelico advertisements, \\"Stay in Tonight\\" and \\"Find a Quiet Table\\", in his 1986 Luxury & Degradation series of paintings and sculptures based on the role of alcohol in culture. According to Koons he used the Frangelico ads to \\"defin[e] a $45,000 and up income\\", in contrast to other works in the series which correspond to lower income levels. Frangelico was a featured brand on the AMC advertising reality show The Pitch in Season 1, Episode 6.

This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group.

It was located at 1655 North Cherokee Avenue, between Hollywood Boulevard and Selma Avenue. Many LA bands frequently performed there, including the Dickies, X, Germs, Bags, the Screamers, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Alley Cats, the Go-Go's, Suburban Lawns, the Mau-Mau's, the Weirdos, the Zeros, the Avengers, the Dils, the Skulls and the Controllers. Rhino 39, one of Long Beach, California's earliest punk rock bands, also played there often. Several bands rented practice space at the Masque, including the Motels, the Controllers, Secrets, the Skulls and the Go-Go's. At least two compilation records featuring live performances at the Masque were released. First generation punk fanzines like Flipside and Slash covered the scene at the Masque. The original Masque was closed by fire marshals on January 14, 1978.Spray Paint the Walls: The Story of Black Flag by Stevie Chick After closing Mullen went on to open and promote shows at the Other Masque (aka New Masque and Masque 2), also located in Hollywood, from December 1978 through spring 1979.http://www.punk- information.com/history4.htm Bands appearing at The Other Masque included the Dead Boys (with local musicians backing Stiv Bators including Nicky Beat of the Weirdos), the Cramps (after moving from New York City), Wall of Voodoo, the Flyboys, the Mutants, Dead Kennedys,The Red Army, X, Germs and others. The loss of the Other Masque resulted in punk bands having to move to the Sunset Strip clubs like the Whisky a Go Go or Gazzari's. This change in performance venues contributed to the fading of the LA punk scene in the early 1980s. After the second Masque closed, Mullen opened Club Lingerie, which lasted until 1991. The music video for \\"Perfect\\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, filmed in 1998, featured The Masque and its original graffiti.YouTube The building was renovated in 2001. While most of the walls were removed, the remaining walls in the basement (which now houses the World of Wonder archive) continue to display much of the original graffiti.

It is located at 210 East, 400 South, across from the Salt Lake City and County Building and Washington Square. History The Salt Lake City Public Library was originally housed in the Salt Lake City and County Building in 1898. Thanks to a donation of land and money by a John Quackenbos Packard in 1900, a new library was built in downtown Salt Lake City; the building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This building remained in use until the library outgrew it by the early 1960s. The city library was then moved to a new home across from the City and County Building at the intersection of 500 South and 200 East. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 28, 1962, and the building was dedicated on October 30, 1964. In 1965, the old library was renovated into the Hansen Planetarium, funded by a donation of $400,000 from Beatrice M. Hansen. =1994 hostage incident= On March 7, 1994, a gunman took several hostages in a conference room on the second floor of the old main branch building. The library was evacuated and SWAT teams were called in during a six-hour siege, which ended in the death of the gunman and the freeing of the hostages. =Move to the current location= After celebrating the library's 100th anniversary in early 1998, an $84 million library bond was approved to relocate the library in a new building, north half a block, to its current location. The firm Moshe Safdie and Associates partnered with a local architecture firm, VCBO Architecture, to design the building, which opened to the public on February 8, 2003. The former building in Library Square houses The Leonardo, a museum of science, technology and creativity. On September 15, 2006, a small bomb exploded in the third floor of the main building. No one was hurt, and the damage sustained by the building was a broken window. Eastbound traffic on the streets of 400 South and 200 East was closed as 400 people were forced to evacuate. =Suicides and attempted suicides = There have been several public suicides at the library since its relocation. In April 2008, a woman jumped from the third floor balcony inside the library and died. In July 2005, a woman jumped from the roof of the building to her death. In March 2011, a woman jumped from the fourth floor inside the building and died. In April 2012, a man jumped from the balcony inside the library to his death. On June 10, 2013, at approximately 4pm, a 21-year-old man jumped to his death from the roof, prompting the closure of the library for the remainder of the day. On November 13, 2013, at approximately 4:15pm, a 21-year-old man was witnessed jumping from the roof of the building. The man survived the fall and was taken to LDS Hospital for his injuries. The event prompted the closure of the library for the remainder of the day. Features The Salt Lake City main library covers an area of in a five-story tall, wedge-shaped building. The library's collection comprises over 500,000 books, subscriptions to over 60 newspapers and magazines, 163 internet-capable computers. The structure includes of concrete, and of glass, including a five-story curved glass outer wall. Designed by the same architect, the downtown Central Branch of the Vancouver Public Library shares a similar design‚Äîmost clearly apparent in the main foyer and the sweeping outer facade. Library Square, a landscaped and paved plaza, encompasses the building's footprint. Originally, much of what is now landscaped open space had been planned to be covered by outbuildings, but Mayor Rocky Anderson asked for these to be left out in favor of creating a public park. Several shops, and the studios of radio station KCPW-FM occupy the Square. The Square itself is paved with limestone from Israel. Upon entering the five story building, one enters the \\"Urban Room\\", which has the same limestone paving as the square. The room extends upward for all five floors and ends with a skylight of . More shops line one side of the Urban Room. A rooftop garden completes the structure. It is planted with trees, grasses, flowering bulbs and various perennial plants, as well as supporting beehives. The whole library depends on natural lighting, reducing the need of lights in the library. A huge five story glass wall provides daylight.

S. El - Awa, Introduction to Textual Relations in Qur'an, pg. 1. Part of the Routledge Studies in the Qur'an series. London: Routledge, 2005. It consists of 286 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt), 6,201 words and 25,500 letters.Ibn Kathir It is a Medinan surah, that is to say that it was supposedly revealed at Medina after the Hijrah, with the exception of the verses with regard to riba (interest or usury) which Muslims believe were revealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage, the last Hajj of Muhammad.Mahmoud Ayoub, The Qur æan and its interpreters, pg. 55. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1984. Maariful Quran in particular, verse 281 in this chapter is believed to be the last verse of the Quran to be revealed, on the 10th of Dhul al Hijjah 10 A.H., when Muhammad was in the course of performing his last Hajj, 80 or 90 days before he died.Qurtubi Surah al-Baqarah (Quran 2) enjoins fasting on the believer during the month of Ramadan.Michael Binyon, Fighting is 'allowed' during the holy month of fasting The Times, 18 December 1998 Background This is the longest chapter in the Quran and was revealed over a long period. It is a Mediniite Surah dealing with the Hypocrite (Munaafiqoon) and injunctions pertaining to various matters. It includes many verses which have virtues like the first four and last three verses and the special Verse of the Throne (Aayatul Kursi). Muhammad is reported to have said, ‚ÄúDo not turn your houses into graves. Verily, Satan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.‚Äù [Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmed] Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash- Sha\`bi said that \`Abdullah bin Mas\`ud said, \\"Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Satan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (255), the following two Ayat (256-257) and the last three Ayat.'' Theme and subject matter The surah addresses a wide variety of topics, including substantial amounts of law, and retells stories of Adam, Ibrahim and Musa. A major theme is guidance: urging the pagans (Al-Mushrikeen) and the Jews of Medina to embrace Islam, and warning them and the hypocrites (Munafiqun) of the fate God had visited in the past on those who failed to heed his call. The stories in this chapter are told to help the reader understand the theological conception of truth in Islam.R. G. Ghattas and Carol B. Ghattas, A Christian Guide to the Qur'an: Building Bridges in Muslim Evangelism, pg. 40. Kregel Academic, 2009. Surah Baqarah also mentions three qualities of the God-fearing (Al-Muttaqin), that is those who possess Taqwa: 1) They believe in the unseen. Faith (Imaan) is believing and accepting something one cannot see i.e. trusting in Muhammad and the Quran. It is believing everything which is part of Imaan, the Angels, destiny etc. 2) They establish Prayer (Salah). The major sign of a person with Taqwa is they perform Prayer/Salaah. ‚ÄúEstablishing‚Äù Salaah is fulfilling its requirements, internally with feelings in the heart, and externally fulfilling its requirements (Wudu, compulsory elements (Fard), Sunnahs, reciting with tajwid etc.) and feeling a connection with Allah. In a tradition or hadith, Muhammad said, ‚ÄúPrayer is the Mi‚Äôraaj of a Mu‚Äômin‚Äù and in Mi‚Äôraaj he spoke to Allah. (In the Surah preceding Surah Al Baqarah, i.e. Surah Fatiha Muslims are believed to have a dialogue with Allah). 3) They spend from what Allah has given them, as this is a form of worship too- namely, considered a financial worship. Spending in the way of God (i.e. giving Sadaqah), is to spend from what Muslims believe that Allah Himself gave them. Sadaqah comes from ‚ÄúSidq‚Äù which means ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù as it shows the truth of a Muslim's Imaan (faith). =2:8-20 The hypocrites= Q2:8-20 in Surah Al Baqarah refer to the hypocrites (Munafiqun). In the Meccan phase of Muhammad, there existed two groups, the Believers and the Mushrikeen (non-believers). However, after Hijrah (Emigration to Medina) Muhammad had to deal with the opposition of those who openly accepted Islam while secretly plotting against Muslims. Their leader was Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy who was about to be crowned king before the arrival of Muhammad in Medina. The hypocrites benefitted from the Muslims while not losing their association with the disbelievers. They were considered disloyal to either parties and inclined towards those who benefited them the most in the worldly sense The surah also sheds light on the concept of Nifaq, which is opposite of sincerity. It is of two types: 1) Nifaq in belief: outwardly showing belief however in reality there is no belief 2) Nifaq in practice: where people believe however they act like hypocrites. The signs of a hypocrite are lying, breaking promises, not keeping an amaanah or trust and when they argue they curse or use bad language. According to a prominent scholar, Kamaluddin Ahmed, Nifaq is something that is within the heart, hence no one knows of its existence except Allah. Therefore, no one can be called a hypocrite or Munaafiq through one's own self-assessment. This would amount to making Takfeer i.e. calling someone a Kafir (non-believer) since Nifaq (hypocrisy) in belief is kufr.

It is one of the most renowned appellations of the southern part in the Rh√¥ne Valley, and its vineyards are located around Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and in neighboring villages, B√©darrides, Courth√©zon and Sorgues, between Avignon and Orange. They cover slightly more than 3,200 hectares or and produce over 110,000 hectolitres of wine a year, more wine made in this one area of the southern Rh√¥ne than in all of the northern Rh√¥ne.K. MacNeil (2001). The Wine Bible. Workman Publishing. p. 248. . History The wine region of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape is located within the Vaucluse department in southeastern France. Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape literally translates to \\"The Pope's new castle\\" and, indeed, the history of this appellation is firmly entwined with papal history. In 1308, Pope Clement V, former Archbishop of Bordeaux, relocated the papacy to the town of Avignon. Clement V and subsequent \\"Avignon Popes\\" were said to be great lovers of Burgundy wines and did much to promote them during the 70-year Avignon Papacy. At the time, wine-growing around the town of Avignon was anything but illustrious. While the Avignon Papacy did much to advance the reputation of Burgundy wines, they also promoted viticulture of the surrounding area, more specifically the area north of Avignon close to the banks of the Rh√¥ne. Prior to the Avignon Papacy, viticulture of that area had been initiated and maintained by the Bishops of Avignon, but largely for local consumption. John XXII, who succeeded Clement V, in addition to Burgundy wine, regularly drank wine from the vineyards to the north and did much to improve viticultural practices there. Under John XXII, the wines of this area came to be known as \\"Vin du Pape\\", this term later becoming \\"Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape.\\" John XXII also built the castle which is the symbol of the appellation. In the 18th century, the wines were shipped under the name vin d'Avignon. Records from the early 19th century mention wines of the name Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape-Calcernier which seems to have been a lighter-style wine than the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape of today. They seem to have increased in reputation within France until phylloxera hit in the early 1870s, which was earlier than most other French wine regions were affected.Jancis Robinson (Ed.), The Oxford Companion to Wine, 3. Ed., Oxford University Press, 2006, , pp. 159-160 Prior to World War I the bulk of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape was sold to Burgundy as vin de m√©decine to be added to Burgundy wine to boost the strength and alcohol levels. =Early AOC regulations= Vineyard with the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape appellation borders, with vines trimmed as bushvines. In the early 20th century, Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape was plagued by wine fraud; various rules for the production of Ch√¢teauneuf-du- Pape, drawn up and promulgated in 1923, were the first Appellation Contr√¥l√©e rules in France, and provided the prototype for subsequent AOC rules.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 127 The original AOC rules allowed ten varieties, and were amended to thirteen in 1936, and eighteen in 2009. Baron Pierre le Roy of Ch√¢teau Fortia was the principal architect of these regulations, which set the minimum alcohol level of the wines and set limits on yields as well as which types of grapes could be grown in which areas. Another of the Baron's requirements was that no vineyards were to be planted on land that was not arid enough to support plantings of both lavender and thyme.H. Johnson and J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 136 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The producers of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape have historically been known to be fiercely protective of their vineyard properties. This is said to have led to the 1954 passing of a municipal decree in the village of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape that banned the overhead flying, landing or taking off of air craft in the commune. , this law has yet to be repealed.F. Prial \\"WINE; \\"Identified Flying Object\\" The New York Times Jan 4, 1987  Climate and geography  The appellation stretches from the eastern bank of the Rh√¥ne near Orange in the north-west to Sorgues near Avignon in the south-east. The altitude reaches 120 meters at its highest, in the northern part of the appellation. It covers 3200 hectares of land with at least three distinct types of soil or terroirs. In the north and north-east the famous galets roul√©s, round rocks or pebbles, cover the clay soil. The rocks are famous for retaining the heat from the plentiful sun, some 2800 hours a year, releasing it at night, ripening the grapes faster than in the eastern part of the appellation, where the soil is mostly sand, or the south, where the soil is more gritty. The powerful mistral wind carries away the moisture, intensifying the dry climate.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger ‚Äì JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 124-125 = Terroir = The characteristic terroir of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape comes from a layer of stones called galets (\\"pebbles\\"). The rocks are typically quartzite and remnants of Alpine glaciers that have been smoothed over millennia by the Rh√¥ne. The stone retains heat during the day and releases it at night which can have an effect of hastening the ripening of grapes. The stones can also serve as a protective layer to help retain moisture in the soil during the dry summer months.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 250 Workman Publishing 2001 Some of the most prestigious vineyards in the area, like Ch√¢teau Rayas, have more traditional looking vineyards without the galets. These are most often vineyards located on south-facing slopes where the night-time radiated heat from the stones would be detrimental to the vines and cause overripening of the grapes. =La Crau= La Crau is one of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape's most famous lieux-dits vineyards. The vineyard is owned primarily by Domaine du Vieux T√©l√©graphe, one of the most classic Ch√¢teauneufs, but also producer Henri Bonneau maintains a firm position here.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger ‚Äì JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , pp. 141‚Äì143 The vineyard is very rich in the aforementioned galets roul√©s, while Domaine du Vieux Lazaret with its over 100 hectares owned by Vignobles J√©r√¥me Quiot is the largest. Wine Vines of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape growing in vineyards filled with galets, trimmed to a bushwine shape Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape can be either red or white wine, but the large majority of the wines produced are red. The appellation rules did not until recently allow production of ros√©. The wines have traditionally been packaged in distinctive heavy dark wine bottles embossed with papal regalia and insignia. However, in recent times a number of producers have dropped the full papal seal in favour of a more generic icon, while still retaining the same heavy glassware. =Grape varieties= Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape traditionally has had thirteen grape varieties, but the 2009 version of the AOC rules changed that list to eighteen varieties, since blanc (white), rose (pink) and noir (black) versions of some grapes are now explicitly listed as separate varieties.D√©cret n¬∞ 2009-1275 du 20 octobre 2009 relatif aux appellations d'origine contr√¥l√©es ¬´Saint-Pour√ßain¬ª, ¬´Bugey¬ª, ¬´Roussette du Bugey¬ª, ¬´Morey- Saint-Denis¬ª, ¬´Tavel¬ª et ¬´Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape¬ª, Version consolid√©e au 24 octobre 2009 Also in the previous version of the appellation rules, Grenache and Picpoul were associated with different pruning regulations in their noir and blanc versions, bringing the number of varieties previously mentioned from thirteen to fifteen.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 249 Workman Publishing 2001 INAO: Appellation rules for Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape last updated March 28, 1993 (superseded by the 2009 version)www.chateauneuf.dk: Grapes, accessed on June 16, 2008 Red varieties allowed are Cinsault, Counoise, Grenache noir, Mourv√®dre, Muscardin, Piquepoul noir, Syrah, Terret noir, and Vaccar√®se (Brun Argent√©). White and pink varieties are Bourboulenc, Clairette blanche, Clairette rose, Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Picardan, Piquepoul blanc, Piquepoul gris, and Roussanne. (The varieties not specifically mentioned before 2009 are Clairette rose, Grenache gris and Piquepoul gris.) Both red and white varieties are allowed in both red and white Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. There are no restrictions as to the proportion of grape varieties to be used, and unlike the case with other appellations, the allowed grape varieties are not differentiated into principal varieties and accessory varieties. Thus, it is theoretically possible to produce varietal Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape from any of the eighteen allowed varieties. In reality, most Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape wines are blends dominated by Grenache. Only one of every 16 bottles produced in the region contains white wine. With 72% of the total vineyard surface in 2004, Grenache noir is very dominant, followed by Syrah at 10.5% and Mourv√®dre at 7%, both of which have expanded in recent decades. Cinsaut, Clairette, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and Bourboulenc each cover 1-2.5%, and the remaining seven varieties each account for 0.5% or less. It is common to grow the vines as gobelets and this is the only vine training system allowed for the first four red varieties. Yields are restricted to two tons per acre. Cuv√©e de la Reine des Bois from Domaine de la Mordor√©e. =Red wines= In most red Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety, although some producers use a higher proportion of Mourv√®dre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourv√®dre can add elegance and structure to the wine. Some estates produce varietal (100%) Grenache noir, while a few producers insist on using at least a token amount of all thirteen originally permitted varieties in their blend. One of the only estates to grow all these varieties and use them consistently in a blend is Ch√¢teau de Beaucastel. Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape red wines are often described as earthy with gamey flavors that have hints of tar and leather. The wines are considered tough and tannic in their youth but maintain their rich spiciness as they age. The wines often exhibit aromas of dried herbs common in Provence under the name of garrigue. Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape dominated by Mourv√®dre tend to be higher in tannin and requiring longer cellaring before being approachable. =White wines= White Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape is produced by excluding the red varieties and only using the six permitted white varieties. The white varieties account for 7 percent of total plantings according to 2004 statistics, and a portion of the whites grapes are blended into red wines, which means that white wine production only accounts for around 5 percent of the total. In white Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache blanc and Roussanne provides fruitiness and fatness to the blend while Bourboulenc, Clairette and Picpoul add acidity, floral and mineral notes. The style of these wines range from lean and minerally to oily and rich with a variety of aromas and flavor notes‚Äîincluding almond, star fruit, anise, fennel, honeysuckle and peach.J. Molesworth \\"The Best White Wine That You're Not Drinking \\" Wine Spectator, December 15, 2007 A single varietal, Roussanne, that is matured in an oak aging barrel, is also made by some estates. Most whites are made to be drunk young. Some white Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape are meant to age and tend to develop exotic aromas and scents of orange peels after 7‚Äì8 years. =Winemaking styles= A Ch√¢teauneuf- du-Pape with the bottle embossed with papal regalia and insignia. Ch√¢teauneuf- du-Pape wines are often high in alcohol, typically 13-15%, and must be minimum 12.5% under the appellation rules with no chaptalization allowed. Winemaking in the region tends to focus on balancing the high sugar levels in the grape with the tannins and phenols that are common in red Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. Following harvest, the grape clusters are rarely destemmed prior to fermentation. The fermentation temperatures are kept high, with the skins being frequently pumped over and punched down for the benefit of tannin levels and color extraction to achieve the characteristic dark Ch√¢teauneuf color. Beginning in the 1970s, market tendencies to prefer lighter, fruitier wines that can be drunk sooner have prompted some estates to experiment with carbonic maceration. Low yields are considered critical to the success of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape with the principal grape varieties tending to make thin and bland wine when produced in higher quantities. The AOC requirements limit yields to 368 gallons per acre, which is nearly half the yields allowed in Bordeaux.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 251 Workman Publishing 2001 The common technique of using small barrel oak is not widely used in the Ch√¢teauneuf-du- Pape area, partly due to the fact that the principal grape Grenache is prone to oxidation in the porous wooden barrels. Instead, Grenache is vinified in large cement tanks, while the other grape varieties are made in large old barrels called foudres that do not impart the same \\"oaky\\" characteristics as the smaller oak barrels. Popular culture In Truth and Advertising, a 19th season episode of the animated television comedy South Park (TV series) Skeeter tells Randy, \\"Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape!\\" In Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, the title character states that \\"I drank half a bottle of ketchup thinking it was Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape!\\" after he was stricken blind in a skating accident. The Beastie Boys rap song \\"Body Movin'\\" contains the lyrics \\"Like a bottle of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape / I'm fine like wine when I start to rap.\\" Richard Castle, the lead character on the TV drama Castle, mentions Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape on several occasions as a wine he drinks or gives as a gift. In Sorry, Bro, a fourth-season episode of How I Met Your Mother, Ted's high school girlfriend Karen informs the waiter that the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape has been mistakenly listed as a Provence wine. In the comedy Frasier, Frasier Crane frequently orders Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape at French restaurants. In Cheers,‚Ñ¢ Frasier Crane mentions Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape as he waxes poetically to Sam Malone during the season 7 episode ‚ÄúPlease Mr. Postman‚Äù. In The M*A*S*H Olympics, a sixth-season episode of the television comedy MASH, Capt. Benjamin Franklin \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and Capt. B.J. Hunnicutt threaten to wash their dirty socks in Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester's Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape if he does not help them finish the calisthenics ordered by Col. Sherman Potter. In \\"Out of Gas\\", a seventh-season episode of the television comedy MASH, Major Charles Emerson Winchester attempts to trade a case of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape for sodium pentothal. In The Magician King by Lev Grossman, the members of the Murs safe house celebrate Julia's 250th magic level with a special dinner and a bottle of expensive Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. In Only Fools and Horses The character Del Boy incorrectly uses the phrase Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape reserved for an explosive situation In American Horror Story Hotel The character Iris, played by Kathy Bates, use a bottle of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape Grenache Blanc to top off the nutrition blend for the two Swedish woman. In the 1971 spaghetti western ¬´My name is still Trinity¬ª Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill are treated to a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape when indulging in a eating orgy at a fine French restaurant. In Good Omens Crowley and Azriaphale drink Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape at the bookshop together. In A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles the Soviets remove the labels from all red wines because they should be equal. Towles' hero, Count Rostov, goes to the hotel cellar where all the wine is kept and identifies the Chateauneuf-du-Pape by feeling for the embossed papal insignia, and reserves them for himself.

The comic books were produced by DC Comics, written by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, and drawn and inked by George P√©rez and Dick Giordano. All three game box covers were illustrated by an Atari in-house illustrator, Warren Chang. A special fan club offer was provided, allowing those who wanted the game to also get a T-shirt and poster for each game. The games of the Swordquest series (along with Atari 2600 Raiders of the Lost Ark) were some of the earliest attempts to combine the narrative and logic elements of the adventure game genre with the twitch gameplay of the action genre, making them some of the very first action-adventure games. However, the last two contests along with the grand finale contest were never held, and the final game in the series was not released, due to Atari's financial problems related to the video game crash of 1983.  Gameplay  Each game of the Swordquest series was themed after the classical elements: earth, fire, water, and air. Each game required the player to move through a maze of rooms, collecting objects from one and placing them in other rooms. The arrangement or theme of the rooms varied with each game: Earthworld was themed after the Western zodiac, Fireworld after the Kabbalah tree of life, Waterworld after the chakras, and with Airworld to have been modeled after the I Ching. Traversing between rooms sometimes required the player to complete a \\"twitch\\"-style minigame to progress. When the player placed an item in its correct room, they would be presented with numerical clues that referred to a page and panel within the comic that was packaged with the game. There, the player would find a hidden word that was part of the larger Swordquest contest, as by submitting all the correct words in the correct order to Atari, they would be entered into the next phase of the project. The discovered words would form a relevant phrase towards the larger contest. In at least two cases, for Earthworld and Fireworld, there were more clues indicated by the game than required to be submitted. Players also had to identify a second clue in the game's instruction manual (for Earthworld, indicating prime numbers to use only clues on prime numbered pages) to know which clues to send in. Plot The games follow twins named Tarra and Torr. Their parents were slain by King Tyrannus's guards, prompted by a prophecy by the king's wizard Konjuro that the twins would slay Tyrannus. The twins were then raised as commoners by thieves to avoid being slain by the king. When they go to plunder Konjuro's sea keep, they accidentally reveal their identities to him. The twins then start running from a demon summoned to kill them, but it appears that a jewel they stole attracts it. After smashing the stone to avoid the demon, two of Tyrannus's old advisers appear and tell the two about the \\"Sword of Ultimate Sorcery\\" and the \\"Talisman of Penultimate Truth.\\" They are then transported to Earthworld. After defeating many beasts of the Zodiac and another thief (Herminus) in Earthworld, the twins are transported to the \\"central chamber\\" where the \\"Sword of Ultimate Sorcery\\" and the \\"Talisman of Penultimate Truth\\" are kept. Upon reaching them, the sword burns a hole through its altar all the way to Fireworld. In Fireworld, the twins split up to look for water, and Torr, with the aid of the talisman, summons Mentorr who shows Torr the \\"Chalice of Light,\\" which will quench his thirst. The twins reunite eventually and find the chalice. However, Torr drops it after he is startled, and it is revealed that the one they found was not the true chalice. Herminus then gives them the chalice, and it grows until it becomes large enough to swallow the twins and transports them to Waterworld. Upon reaching Waterworld, the twins become separated. Tarra travels to a ship made of ice, somehow forgets her name, and meets Cap'n Frost, who desires to find the \\"Crown of Life\\" and rule Waterworld. Meanwhile, Torr travels to an undersea kingdom, forgets his name as well and meets the city's ex-queen Aquana, who desires to find the \\"Crown of Life\\" in order to regain her throne. After a brief war between the ex-queen and captain, Herminus sets the twins to duel each other. They then pray to their deities for guidance, which summons Mentorr who allows them to regain their memories. The twins throw down their swords, causing the crown to be revealed and split in half. The halves are given to the ex-queen and the captain, who then rule as equals. The \\"Sword of Ultimate Sorcery\\" then transports the twins to Airworld where they would have to do battle with King Tyrannus and Konjuro. While the comic for Airworld was started, the cancellation of the series left the comic unfinished.  Development  The concept of Swordquest originated from Atari's previous Adventure video game, which is notable for one of the first documented Easter eggs. Adventure drew more interest once the Easter egg was found and documented, leading Atari to come up with a type of sequel where \\"marketing thought it would be a great idea to create a series of games where players would have to find clues both in the game [and in its physical materials]\\", as described by Atari historian Curt Vendel. As Atari was owned by Warner Communications at this point, they were able to use two of Warner's subsidiaries to help with this contest. DC Comics was used to create the comic book that would help creating the setting where the word clues would be hidden, written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas and illustrated by George P√©rez. The Franklin Mint crafted the game's prizes. The games themselves were programmed by Tod Frye. = Contest = Atari had designed the Swordquest contest to award a winner for each of the four games. For each game, they had planned to bring all winners to the Atari headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, to race to complete a specially-programmed version of that game to be the first to finish it. The person with the fastest completion would be named the winner and be awarded a \\"treasure\\", produced by Franklin Mint, each valued at around at the time of Swordquests release. The prizes were: * Earthworld: The \\"Talisman of Penultimate Truth\\", an 18-carat solid gold disc studded with 12 diamonds and the birthstones of the 12 Zodiac signs, along with a miniature white gold sword set atop it. * Fireworld: The \\"Chalice of Light\\", a goblet made of platinum and gold studded with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and green jade. * Waterworld: The \\"Crown of Life\\", a solid gold crown decorated with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and aquamarines. * Airworld: The \\"Philosopher‚Äôs Stone\\", a large piece of white jade in an 18-karat gold box encrusted with emeralds, rubies, and diamonds. The four winners would then have competed in a final contest to win the ultimate prize, \\"The Sword of Ultimate Sorcery\\" with a silver blade and an 18-carat gold handle covered with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and rubies, that was valued at For Earthworld, about 5000 entries were received, but only eight answered correctly. The contest was held in May 1983, with Stephen Bell winning the Talisman. For Fireworld, Atari received several more entries, with 73 of these being correct. For practicality, Atari required the 73 finalists to write a brief essay of what they liked about the game, selecting the top 50 replies to continue to the final competition, held in January 1984. This was won by Michael Rideout, who was awarded the Chalice. At this point in time, Atari had suffered major financial setbacks due to the 1983 video game crash. Atari was further in the midst of dealing with fallout from an insider trading scandal by former CEO Ray Kassar; Kassar was replaced by James J. Morgan in mid-1983, and looking to cut financial losses, eventually cancelled the Swordquest project, despite work having already started on Airworld. However, because the company had already advertised the availability of the Waterworld contest, Atari's lawyers required the company to continue the contest. To limit the number of entries, Waterworld was only made available to members of the Atari Club. During the contest period, in mid-1984, Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel, the owner of Commodore International. Tramiel, who had been more focused on the success of home computers than gaming consoles, placed the Atari divisions in a new company, Tramel Technology, and reviewed the state of all divisions, furthering the troubles in completing the Waterworld contest. Most who did enter the Waterworld contest were told they did not qualify for the final, but according to Vendel, Atari was legally required to follow through as advertised on the Waterworld contest. Vendel stated that Atari did secretly invite those with correct entries to hold the final round, and the Crown was awarded to a person, their name remaining anonymous due to legal requirements. Because they could not hold the ultimate final round, Bell and Rideout were both awarded an additional as well as an Atari 7800 as a compensation prize, and granting the ten finalists of Waterworld each. The fate of the prizes has been a type of urban legend since the cancellation of the project. Of the five treasures, Rideout has confirmed, as late as 2017, that he still has the Chalice in his possession, stored in a safety deposit box. Bell fell out of contact following the Swordquest event, but according to Vendel and Rideout, Bell appeared to have had the disc part of the Talisman melted down for its value (about at the time), keeping the small sword, diamonds, and birthstones; the current fate of these is unknown. The fate of the Crown is unknown; Vendel stated that while Atari was required to hold the contest, they could have awarded the winner with a cash prize equivalent as opposed to the Crown. Since they were never part of any contest, the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone and the Sword had seemingly disappeared. Some claimed that Tramiel had taken these prizes for himself, based on observations that Atari staff had made of seeing a similar looking sword mounted on Tramiel's home mantel. Vendel believed that the persons who started this rumor mistook a Tramiel family heirloom for the Swordquest sword. Vendel argued that it was extremely unlikely that Tramiel would have been able to keep the Stone, Sword, and (if not given away) Crown, as when Atari was sold, these items had been property of Warner Communications until awarded and would have been returned to the Franklin Mint. With the Franklin Mint being later sold in 1985 to American Protective Services, and the original Atari business no more, the Mint would have more likely smelted the items back to their base components to reuse elsewhere, according to Vendel. Comic books =Original Mini- Comics= Each of the three released games shipped with a comic book, published jointly by Atari and DC Comics. The books included clues to solve the puzzles within each of the games. =Dynamite Entertainment Mini-Series= In February 2017, Dynamite Entertainment announced a new comic book series, called Swordquest, but based on the actual contest around the three games, rather than the story within the games. It was a six-issue series, starting with a special #0 \\"Preview\\" book that sold with a cover price of 25¬¢. The remaining 5 issues, published monthly after the Preview, sold at $3.99 each. In addition, Dynamite released a trade paperback volume that reprinted the above 3 Mini-Comics along with the Mini-Comic for the game Yars' Revenge. As with the originals, the TPB is sized as a mini-comic itself. The series featured the story of a person who had played the three Swordquest games (with help from two friends who were brother and sister) when he was younger and was anticipating Airworld. Now as an adult, he continues his efforts to play Airworld using his old Atari hardware, but manages to get caught up with a mysterious figure who offers to help him obtain the real \\"Sword of Ultimate Sorcery\\" from its resting place in the World Arcade Museum. As well as being valuable, it may have its own mysterious powers. The man contacts his two childhood friends to accompany him on his new \\"Swordquest\\". The comic was written by Chad Bowers and Chris Sims and had art by Scott Kowalchuk under the pseudonym \\"Ghostwriter X\\". The first #0 \\"Preview\\" issue got published in May 2017, with the remaining 5 issues released monthly after that. A trade paperback reprint of all 6 issues, titled Swordquest: Realworld was released in February 2018. Reception Richard A. Edwards reviewed Swordquest: Earthworld in The Space Gamer No. 61. Edwards commented that \\"The only reason to purchase a copy of Swordquest: Earthworld is to try and solve the puzzle and win the prize. Gamers not interested in spending the time required should pass this one.\\" In popular culture Both the novel Ready Player One and the film adaptation reference the Swordquest series.

It is located 4 miles (6.5 km) southeast of central Gloucester, 6 miles (9.5 km) southwest of Cheltenham and 11.5 miles (18.5 km) north of Stroud. The population taken at the 2011 census was 7,387. Since the mid-20th century, Brockworth has been known locally for the annual rolling of Double Gloucester cheese down Cooper's Hill. During World War II the nearby village of Hucclecote at the Gloster Aircraft Company produced the famous Hawker Hurricane fighter, and following the war it gained renewed fame for producing several notable aircraft, including Britain's first jet aircraft, which was test flown here. Brockworth is also the birthplace of actor, comedian and writer Simon Pegg. Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists in Tewkesbury Borough. The population and area of this ward are identical to that shown above. Brockworth has a parish council. History The name Brockworth is derived from the Saxon \\"wurthin\\" for enclosure and \\"broc\\" for brook. Settlement is believed to have occurred around 600 AD, after the defeat of the Gloucester-based Romano British at the Battle of Dyrham in 577 AD. Older, Roman remains have been found locally but they indicate an estate rather than a village. Also, the Saxon-derived name suggests that the first settlers were Saxons. The oldest surviving building in the village is the Grade I listed building St George's Church, which dates back to 1142. The present structure has elements from then until the nineteenth century. Adjacent to this is the Tudor manor house Brockworth Court, a Grade II* listed building, that was built between 1534 and 1539 for Richard Hart, the last prior of Llanthony Priory. Brockworth was the third in a series of rural villages located along an old Roman road following a more-or-less straight line to the inland port city of Gloucester. Its original semi-remote location made it ideal for the location of an aircraft factory (now the Gloucester Business Park) where aeroplanes could be built and tested without worries about noise. Also, land availability made the area ideal for a flight test airfield. =Gloster Aircraft Company= The Gloster Aircraft Company was first formed at Hucclecote, Gloucestershire in 1915, as the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company. In 1926 the name of the company was abbreviated to Gloster Aircraft Company because customers outside of the United Kingdom found the original name too difficult to pronounce. In May 1934 the company was purchased by Hawker Aircraft but the company name was unchanged. From 1921 the company produced the following aircraft types: Sparrowhawk, Nighthawk, Nightjar, Grouse, Grebe, Gamecock, Gorcock, Guan, Gambit, Gnatsnapper, Gauntlet, Gladiator, Hawker Hurricane; Hawker Typhoon; Gloster Meteor and Gloster Javelin and its runway became famous for the first flight of Sir Frank Whittle's turbo-jet aircraft. =Brockworth bombed= The Gloster Aircraft Company (known locally as GAC) drew upon an employment pool from the surrounding area and it was responsible for much of the growth in the development of housing estates which was halted by the outbreak of World War II. During the war Brockworth and the surrounding area were bombed by the Luftwaffe in an attempt to halt the production of aircraft. =1939‚Äì45 WWII production= As the pre-war biplane Gladiator was rapidly rendered obsolete by faster monoplanes the Brockworth factory was available to manufacture Hawker aircraft. In 1939 the company built 1,000 Hawker Hurricanes in the first 12 months of World War II and it delivered the last of 2,750 Hurricanes in 1942. Production was then switched to building 3,330 Hawker Typhoons for the Royal Air Force. On 8 April 1941 the first test flight of the Gloster E28/39 with a single turbo-jet engine (invented by Sir Frank Whittle) took off from the company's flight test airfield at Brockworth. This was followed by the twin-engined Gloster Meteor, the only jet to be used by the Allied Forces during World War II. The speed of the Meteor enabled it to fly alongside V1 flying bombs, tip them off course, to crash before they could arrive at their London target. In 1945 the Meteor gained a world speed record of 606 mph (975 km/h) and it was eventually put into service by 12 nations. =Post-WWII developments= Following World War II it took the area many years to revive; but after the mid-1950s, renewed housing growth, the development of motorways and redistricting eventually changed the entire look of Brockworth and what were once adjoining villages. In 1952 the Brockworth factory produced the two seat, delta-winged Gloster Javelin which was developed as an all weather fighter that could fly above 50,000 feet at almost the speed of sound. In 1962 the Gloster Aircraft Company closed down and its once famous runway fell victim of redistricting and it is now within the boundary of Hucclecote. The airfield has now been redeveloped as the modern Gloucester Business Park, with additional housing developments continuing to grow around it.

A large round cheese is rolled down the steep slope of the hill and chased by a group of \\"runners\\", who in fact spend most of their brief descent to the bottom of the hill falling and tumbling. Two hundred years ago this was part of a larger mid-summer festival with other activities and competitions, but the event is now confined to the cheese- rolling and is held in May during the Spring Bank-holiday Monday. It is usually said to have originated as a pagan festival celebrating the arrival of summer, fertility, or both.

Early career Huffington was born in Tomball, Texas. He graduated from Southern Methodist University where he was a brother of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He earned both Master of Arts and Ph.D. degrees in geology from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After serving as, first ensign and then lieutenant commander in the United States Navy from 1942‚Äì1945, he returned to Texas in 1946 and worked as a field geologist for Humble Oil, now known as Exxon, U.S.A. HUFFCO In 1956, he set up his own oil and natural gas exploration company known as Roy M. Huffington, Inc. (Huffco). Huffco grew to be a major independent international oil company active around the world. In 1966 HUFFCO signed production sharing contract with Pertamina to explore oil in the Kutai Basin of the Mahakam River delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Initially the exploration object was oil, but finally Huffco discovered a giant natural gas reserve in 1972 at Badak Field. Then Huffco and Pertamina initiated to build an LNG plant in Bontang. First shipping was in August 1977, only five years after discovery.

It was named after railroad worker John H. Kelso, whose name was placed into a hat along with two other workers to decide the name of the town. The town was built in 1905 specifically as a railroad station along the rail line between Utah and Los Angeles, originally called \\"Siding 16,\\" because of its location and nearby springs that provided abundant water. Starting off as what was a simple train depot in the 1920s, the town of Kelso boomed briefly to as many as 2000 residents in the 1940s, when borax and iron mines opened nearby. Gold and silver were also discovered in the nearby hills of what became known as the Kelso district. The town shrank again when the mines closed after about a decade. Restored restaurant at depot. Kelso was a base of operations for the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, connecting track of Union Pacific Railroad, to which the SPLA&SL; had negotiated trackage rights, with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway east-west line to the south. Here, trains were watered and \\"helper\\" locomotives were attached to assist the regular trains in climbing the steep Cima Hill. The distance between Las Vegas and the connection with the Santa Fe line at Daggett was too far for trains without a meal car, so Kelso was a convenient spot for a restaurant stop. The depot building itself was built in 1923 using a Spanish \\"California mission\\" building style. It contained boarding rooms for railroad employees and a restaurant for both employees and passengers. It also had a telegraph office and waiting room. Later, a restaurant nicknamed the \\"Beanery\\" that served home-style meals was housed in the building. The large rooms in the basement also served as a community center for local residents. About 1944 the railroad brought in an old strap-iron jail to detain local drunks. It is now on display just outside the Kelso Depot. The depot remained in operation until 1986. Left to the harsh conditions in the desert, the building began to deteriorate. By the mid-1990s the railroad was on the verge of demolishing the depot. Preservationists then stepped in to save it. It was recently renovated to become the Mojave National Preserve's visitor center. Renovation was completed in 2005 and the depot is now open to the public. During the 1970s Kelso was known as the town without television. About 75 residents lived in Kelso, many with school age children. Television signals could not reach the town which meant that residents found other methods of recreation. However, with the advent of satellite dishes, television was eventually introduced to Kelso. The ZIP Code is 92309 and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760. Restored telegraph office at depot. The Kelso Mountains are located north of Kelso, the Kelso Dunes lie to the southwest, and the entire area lies within the boundary of the Mojave National Preserve.

Fairbank is believed to have aided the escape of 47 slaves. Pardoned in 1849 after four years of his first sentence, Fairbank returned to his Underground Railroad work. He was arrested in 1851 with the aid of the governor of Indiana, who was enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Fairbank was convicted again in Kentucky and served the full sentence of 15 years. Early life Calvin Fairbank was born in 1816 in Pike, in what is now Wyoming County, New York, to Chester Fairbank and his wife; he grew up in an intensely religious family environment. It was also the period of the Second Great Awakening, and western New York was a center of evangelical activity. Listening to the stories told by two escaped slaves whom he met at a Methodist quarterly meeting, the young Fairbank became strongly anti-slavery. He began his career freeing slaves in 1837 when, piloting a lumber raft down the Ohio River, he ferried a slave across the river to free territory. Soon he was delivering escaped slaves to the Quaker abolitionist Levi Coffin for transportation on the Underground Railroad to northern US cities or to Canada. Aliases Calvin Fairbank used aliases: Samuel P. King,Louisville Daily Courier, Louisville, KY 11 Nov 1851 p3 Arrest of a Kidnapper. Samuel S. King, John Doe, Richard Roe/Rowe and John Rowe.The Courier-Journal, Louisville, KY 18 Nov 1851 p3 Samuel S. King alias Calvin Fairbanks for arresting the slave of Mrs. Shotwell. Methodist Episcopal Church The Methodist Episcopal Church licensed Fairbank to preach in 1840 and ordained him as a minister in 1842. Hoping to improve his education, he enrolled in 1844 in the \\"preparatory division\\" of Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Ohio, now Oberlin College. It was interracial and a center of anti-slavery sentiment. At Oberlin, Fairbank met future AME bishop, John M. Brown and the pair worked together in underground railroad activities.Runyon, Randolph Paul. Delia Webster and the Underground Railroad. University Press of Kentucky, 2015. p33 Abolitionist =Gilson Berry= Responding to an appeal to rescue the wife and children of an escaped slave named Gilson Berry, Fairbank went to Lexington, Kentucky, where he made contact with Delia Webster, a teacher from Vermont who was working there and had become active as an abolitionist. She was to help with the rescue, but Berry's wife failed to meet Fairbank as planned. By chance, he met Lewis Hayden and his family, who were planning an escape. He asked Hayden, \\"Why do you want your freedom?\\" Hayden responded, \\"Because I am a man.\\" Lewis Hayden, ex-slave, abolitionist, businessman, and Republican representative from Boston to the Massachusetts state legislature in 1873; 19th-century portrait =The Haydens= Fairbank and Webster transported Hayden, his wife Harriet and Harriet's son Joseph by carriage to freedom in Ripley, Ohio. (See John Rankin (abolitionist).) The fugitive couple put flour on their faces to appear white and, in times of danger, would hide their son under the wagon seat. As Fairbank and Webster returned to Kentucky, they were identified and arrested for assisting the runaway slaves. Webster was tried in December 1844 and sentenced to two years in the Kentucky state penitentiary, but she was pardoned by the governor after serving less than two months of her sentence. Fairbank was tried in 1845 and sentenced to a 15-year term, five years for each of the slaves he helped free. He was pardoned in 1849 in an effort begun by his father.Tom Calarco, People of the Underground Railroad: A Biographical Dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. 155 Effectively Lewis Hayden ransomed Fairbank, as he raised the $650 demanded by his former master to approve the pardon. Hayden had quickly collected the money within a few weeks from 160 people in Boston, where he and his family had settled. =Tamar= In 1851, Fairbank helped a slave named Tamar escape from Kentucky to Indiana. On November 9 of that year, with the connivance of the sheriff of Clark County, Indiana and Indiana Governor Joseph A. Wright, marshals from Kentucky abducted Fairbank and took him back to their state for trial. In 1852, he was sentenced to 15 years in the state penitentiary. While imprisoned, he was singled out for exceptionally harsh treatment; he was frequently flogged and overworked. =Imprisonment effects= Over his combined imprisonment of more than 17 years, Fairbank was reported to have received 35,000 lashes in prison floggings. In an April 5, 1850 article, The Liberator summarized a letter from Fairbank to William Lloyd Garrison: \\"He expresses gratitude to the people of Boston, indicates an intention to write a book about his experiences, and indicates that letters to him can be sent in care of Lewis Hayden.\\" Finally, in 1864, three years into the American Civil War, Fairbank was pardoned by Acting Governor Richard T. Jacob, who had long advocated the activist's release. when Thomas Bramlette returned to office, he had Jacob arrested and expelled from the state for his attacks on Lincoln during the presidential campaign and support for George B. McClellan. Marriage and family Mandana Tileston Fairbank Once free, Fairbank married Mandana Tileston, to whom he had been engaged for thirteen years, since his brief period of freedom in 1851. Known as \\"Dana,\\" she moved from Williamsburg, Massachusetts, to Oxford, Ohio, in order to visit Fairbank in prison as often as possible and to press the case for his pardon with the Governor of Kentucky. Their only child, Calvin Cornelius Fairbank, was born in 1868. The conditions of Fairbank's life in prison broke his health. Although he held jobs with missionary and benevolent societies, he was not able to support his family. At one point, he and his wife tried to earn a living operating a bakery in the utopian community of Florence, Massachusetts. After Mandana Fairbank died of tuberculosis in 1876, Calvin gave their son to the care of her sister and brother-in-law. Fairbank remarried in 1879, but little is known of his second wife, Adeline Winegar, except that she was the daughter of Henry and Jane Winegar and like Calvin, a native of Pike. In the 1870 census she had been listed as a domestic servant. She died of cancer on February 12, 1901 in Angelica, and was buried next to Calvin in the local cemetery. Memoirs Fairbank wrote his memoir, publishing it in 1890 under the title, Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times: How He \\"Fought the Good Fight\\" to Prepare \\"the Way.\\" This effort earned him little money. He died in near-poverty in Angelica, New York. He was buried there in the Until the Day Dawn Cemetery. He is generally credited with helping free 47 slaves.Fairbank, Calvin. Rev.

Push for posthumous pardon In the 21st century, James Pritchard, a retired state archivist for Kentucky who has published articles about the Underground Railroad, and several other persons are working to petition Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear to pardon Fairbank and others convicted of helping slaves escape. From 1844 to 1870, Kentucky imprisoned 44 persons for activities to free slaves in the state, not releasing the last man until five years after the end of the American Civil War. Eight of these persons died in prison.James Pritchard, Into the Fiery Furnace, Part I: Anti-Slavery Prisoners in the Kentucky State Penitentiary 1844‚Äì1870 , 2006, Kentucky's Underground Railroad, KET-TV, accessed 3 December 2013 See also * Laura Smith Haviland * Harriet Tubman * Sojourner Truth * List of African-American abolitionists * Slavery in Canada * National Underground Railroad Freedom Center * Westfield, Indiana References Bibliography * *Rev.

Tekhelet (; alternate spellings include tekheleth, t'chelet, techelet and techeiles) is a \\"blue-violet\\", \\"blue\\", or \\"turquoise\\" dye highly prized by ancient Mediterranean civilizations and mentioned 49 times in the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh. It was used in the clothing of the High Priest, the tapestries in the Tabernacle, and the tzitzit (fringes) affixed to the corners of one's four-cornered garments, including the tallit. Tekhelet dye was critical for the production of certain articles in the Jerusalem Temple, as well as for the commandment of tzitzit. Tekhelet is most notably mentioned in the third paragraph of the Shema, quoting . However, neither the source nor method of production of Tekhelet is specified in the Bible, but according to the ToseftaTosefta Menachot9:6 the ·∏§illazon is the exclusive source of the dye. The Talmud further informs us that the dye of Tekhelet was produced from a marine creature known as the ·∏§illazon.Menachot 44a A garment with tzitzit has four tassels, each containing four strings. There are three opinions in Rabbinic literature as to how many of the four strings should be dyed with tekhelet: two strings;Rashi, Tosafos, Rosh one string;Raavad or one-half string.Rambam Knowledge of how to produce tekhelet was lost in medieval times, and since then tzitzit did not include tekhelet. However, in modern times, many Jews believe they have identified the ·∏§illazon and rediscovered tekhelet manufacture process, and now wear tzitzit which include the resulting blue dye.  Biblical references  Of the 49 or 48 uses in the Masoretic Text, one refers to fringes on cornered garments of the whole nation of Israel (), 44 refer to the priesthood or temple clothes and garments. The remaining 6 in Esther, Jeremiah and Ezekiel are secular uses; such as when Mordechai puts on \\"blue and white\\" \\"royal clothing\\" in Esther. The color could be used in combination with other colors such as 2 Chronicles where the veil of Solomon's Temple is made of blue-violet (Tekhelet), purple (Hebrew: ◊ê÷∑◊®÷∞◊í÷∏÷º◊û÷∏◊ü Argaman) and scarlet (Biblical Hebrew: ◊©÷∏◊Å◊†÷¥◊ô (Shani); Late Biblical, Modern Hebrew: ◊õ÷∑÷º◊®÷∞◊û÷¥◊ô◊ú karmiyl). may indicate the source of the shellfish to have been the Aegean region.Gesenius Hebrew lexicon entry for \\"Isles of Elisha\\" ‚Äì more modern source needed In addition to the above observations it should be added that all of the instances of tekhelet (both secular and priestly) attribute its usage to some kind of elite. From this perspective it becomes obvious that it was difficult to obtain and expensive what is further corroborated by the later rabbinic writings.  History  At some point following the Roman destruction of the Second Temple, the actual identity of the source of the dye was lost, and during a period of over 1,400 years, most Jews have only worn plain white tassels (Tzitzit). The stripes on prayer shawls, often black, but also blue or purple, are believed by many to symbolize what the lost Tekhelet which is referred to by various sources as being \\"black as midnight\\", \\"blue as the midday sky\\", and even purple.Simmons, Rabbi Shraga. Tallit stripes These stripes of tekhelet inspired the design of the flag of Israel.  Identifying the color of tekhelet  Despite the general agreement of the most of the modern English translations of the phrase, the term tekhelet itself presents several basic problems. First of all, it remains unclear to what extent the word in biblical times denoted an abstract color or the actual source material. This problem is specific neither for the tekhelet nor for the biblical Hebrew and the scholars often point to other languages which feature similar phenomena.Tomasz Sikora, ‚ÄúColor Symbolism in the Jewish Mysticism. Prolegomena‚Äù (Polish), Studia Judaica 12.2 (2003): 47. Second, although with time it came to denote the color blue solely, the exact hue in the Antiquity remains unknown. Basing on the scarce material evidence from the ancient Near East and the early biblical translations the scholars suppose that tekhelet probably belonged to the spectrum between blue, red and purple.Robert Laird Harris, Gleason L. Archer and Bruce K. Waltke, Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, (Chicago, 1980/2013) [TWOT] (CD-ROM), 2510.0. In the Septuagint, tekhelet was translated into Greek as hyakinthos (, \\"hyacinth\\"). The color of the hyacinth flower ranges from violet blue to a bluish purple. The early rabbinic literature in turn provide two main expositions for the color of techelet. One group of sources, including Bava Metziya 61a-b and Menachot 40a-b, mentions qala ilan, an indigo dye described as visually indistinguishable from tekhelet. Yet, although this dye was much cheaper to obtain, the rabbis cursed those who substituted techelet with some low-priced equivalent and in fact preferred to annul the obligation altogether rather than to compromise its value (Mishnah Menachot 4:1), which clearly proves that it was not the color which mattered most. The second and much more numerous group compares the tekhelet to the color of the sky or the sea which is not far off from indigo. More importantly, however, this group contains several instances (Menachot 43b, Sotah 17a, Hullin 89a, Numbers Rabbah 4:13, 17:5) which extend the comparison and liken the tekhelet to the throne of glory. Apparently, the particular features of this divine chair are not speculated in the ERL, but it can be safely assumed that, again, these were not the visual qualities which counted here but rather the extraordinary value of the object and its explicit cultic associations. Rashi describes the color of tekhelet as ‚Äúpoireau,‚Äù the French word for leek, transliterated into Hebrew. In conclusion, its color varies between central sky blue in sunlight, through the iris indigo of the rainbow to deep African violet in dull weather; translated in a German translation of the biblical book of Exodus, as \\"blauem purpur\\".  Identifying the ·∏•illazon  Various sea creatures have been suggested as the ·∏•illazon, the purported source of the blue dye.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ‚Äì Page 1057 Geoffrey W. Bromiley ‚Äì 2007 \\"The most highly prized dye in the ancient world obtained from the secretions of four molluscs native to the eastern Mediterranean: helix ianthina, murex brandaris, murex trunculus, and purpura lapillus. Various shades could be produced\\" = Hexaplex trunculus = A guide from the Ptil Tekhelet Foundation shows how a piece of wool, dipped into the solution for the Hexaplex trunculus based dye, turns into leek-like green in sunlight, and eventually into (dark) blue with a purple hue. In his doctoral thesis (London, 1913) on the subject, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog (1889‚Äì1959) named Hexaplex trunculus (then known by the name \\"Murex trunculus\\") as the most likely candidate for the dye's source. Though Hexaplex trunculus fulfilled many of the Talmudic criteria, Rabbi Herzog's inability to consistently obtain blue dye (sometimes the dye was purple) from the snail precluded him from declaring it to be the dye source. According to Zvi Koren, a professor of chemistry, Tekhelet was close in color to midnight blue. This conclusion was reached based on the chemical analysis of a 2000-year old patch of dyed fabric recovered from Masada in the 1960s. The sample, shown to have been dyed with Murex snail extraction, is a midnight blue with a purplish hue. Additionally, in 2013, Na'ama Sukenik of the Israel Antiquities Authority verified a 1st-century CE-dated fragment of blue-dyed fabric to have used H. trunculus as the source of its pure blue color. In the 1980s, Otto Elsner, a chemist from the Shenkar College of Fibers in Israel, discovered that if a solution of the dye was exposed to ultraviolet rays, such as from sunlight, blue instead of purple was consistently produced.O. Elsner, \\"Solution of the enigmas of dyeing with Tyrian purple and the Biblical tekhelet\\", Dyes in history and Archaeology 10 (1992) p 14f. In 1988, Rabbi Eliyahu Tavger dyed Tekhelet from H. trunculus for the Mitzvah (commandment) of Tzitzit for the first time in recent history. Based on this work, four years later, the Ptil Tekhelet Organization was founded to educate about the dye production process, and to make the dye available for all who desire to use it. The television show The Naked Archaeologist interviews an Israeli scientist who also makes the claim that this mollusk is the correct animal. A demonstration of the production of the blue dye using sunlight to produce the blue color is shown. The dye is extracted from the hypobranchial gland of Hexaplex trunculus snails. Chemically, exposure to sunlight turns the red 6,6'-dibromoindigo in snails into a mixture of blue indigo dye and blue-purple 6-bromoindigo. The leuco (white) solution form of dibromoindigo loses some bromines in the ultraviolet radiation. = Sepia officinalis = In 1887, Grand Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner, the Radziner Rebbe, researched the subject and concluded that Sepia officinalis (common cuttlefish) met many of the criteria. Within a year, Radziner chassidim began wearing Tzitzit that included threads dyed with a colorant produced from this cephalopod. Some Breslov Hasidim also adopted this custom due to Rebbi Nachman of Breslov's pronouncement on the great importance of wearing Tekhelet and in emulation of Rabbi Avraham ben Nachram of Tulchyn, a prominent Breslov teacher who accepted the view of his contemporary, the Radziner Rebbe. Rabbi Herzog obtained a sample of this dye and had it chemically analyzed. The chemists concluded that it was a well-known synthetic dye \\"Prussian blue\\" made by reacting Iron(II) sulfate with an organic material. In this case, the cuttlefish only supplied the organic material which could have as easily been supplied from a vast array of organic sources (e. g., ox blood). R. Herzog thus rejected the cuttlefish as the ·∏§illazon and some suggest that had the Grand Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner known this fact, he too would have rejected it based on his explicit criterion that the blue color must come from the animal and that all other additives are permitted solely to aid the color in adhering to the wool.P'til T'khelet, p.168 = Janthina = Within his doctoral research on the subject of Tekhelet, Herzog placed great hopes on demonstrating that Hexaplex trunculus was the genuine snail ·∏§illazon. However, having failed to consistently achieve blue dye from Hexaplex trunculus, he wrote: ‚ÄúIf for the present all hope is to be abandoned of rediscovering the ·∏§illazon Shel Tekhelet in some species of the genera Murex (now \\"Hexaplex\\") and Purpura we could do worse than suggest Janthina as a not improbable identification\\".Herzog, p.71 Although blue dye has in the meantime been obtained from Hexaplex trunculus snail, in 2002 Dr. S. W. Kaplan of Rehovot, Israel, sought to investigate Herzog's suggestion that Tekhelet came from the extract of Janthina. After fifteen years of research he concluded that Janthina was not the ancient source of the blue dye.

Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue rather than it being necessarily a specific dye. Additionally, it is also believed by the Karaites that the Rabbinic tradition that the dye is produced from a mollusc known in Rabbinic tradition as the \\"·∏§illazon\\" is incorrect, because such an impure (a definition mostly overlapping \\"un-Kasher\\", or \\"treif\\") source would be prohibited by the Torah, proposing instead that the source of the dye was indigo or woad (the \\"Asp of Jerusalem\\" plant Isatis tinctoria, used as a fast dye in Ancient Egypt).They Shall Make for Themselves Sisith (Fringe/Tassel) by Hakham Meir Yosef RekhaviWhat is the True Tekhelet? by Dr. Curtis D.

It has seven editions printed from Bengaluru, Hubballi, Davanagere, Hosapete, Mysuru, Mangaluru, and Kalburgi. History and Background  History  Deccan Herald was launched on June 17, 1948. According to Gautham Machaiah, its owners purchased a dance club -- Funnel's owned by an Irish couple. The intention was of starting a movie theatre (there were already two other theatres on either side -- Plaza and Liberty) but then opted for a newspaper, despite having \\"zero experience in journalism or print business\\". Founder K.N. Guruswamy (1901-1990) was the eldest son of a prominent businessman of Ballari (Bellary), who later shifted to Bangalore, and the family belonged to the Ediga community, which was traditionally involved in toddy tapping. They won excise contracts and expanded their business across (then known as Mysore, now Karnataka). Bangalore was then under the Mysore kingdom, ruled by the Wodeyers, and lacked an English newspaper in those times. The then Diwan of Mysore, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, is believed to have been instrumental in convincing Guruswamy to start an English-language daily and he launched the firm The Printers (Mysore) Pvt Ltd. Justice P P Medappa, later the state's chief justice, suggested the name Deccan Herald. Of the Rs 500,000 capital, some 75% came from Guruswamy. Other shareholders were K. Venkataswamy, Moola Rangappa, M K Swamy and Dondusa, according to Machaiah. He documents the challenges of getting it started. Deccan Herald was initially launched as an eight-page tabloid paper, priced at one anna. It later became a broadsheet. Deccan Herald launched a sister daily in Kannada, called Prajavani. T. S. Ramachandra Rao was its first editor. It has played a prominent role in the world of Kannada newspaper journalism. Subsequent publications launched by the group include lifestyle magazine Sudha (initiated in 1965 and edited by E.R. Sethuram) and the literary magazine Mayura, launched in 1968. Only in 1956, eight years after launch, was the newspaper able to break even. Earlier, Guruswamy had to depend on bank loans and selling all but three of the 35 buildings he had purchased from proceeds of his excise business. Guruswamy moved out of from the liquor business by 1986. Guruswamy, being without an heir, adopted his brother K.N. Anjanappa's son K.A. Nettakallappa, who became a well-known journalist but died young at the age of 47. Nettakallappa and Prajavani editor Ramachandra Rao are credited with playing a pioneering role in founding the Press Club of Bangalore. Nettakallappa's sons -- K.N. Hari Kumar, K.N. Tilak Kumar, and K.N. Shanth Kumar -- have been at the helm of the publications. The publications adopt a policy of \\"objectivity, integrity, impartiality and truth flying high\\". It's tagline currently (2019) is \\"The Power of Good.\\"  Recent status  Sitaraman Shankar is the editor, as of August 2019. In August 2019, the Deccan Herald relaunched its newspaper with a \\"revamped look to attract younger readers. Edinburgh-based Palmer Watson Words and Pictures design agency Deccan Herald has revamped its look. The English daily has got a new masthead in aqua blue, a colour to attract younger audience who need coaxing to pick up a newspaper. It added a new business section on Mondays, a Sunday opinion page called The Prism, and an entertainment section Showtime on Saturdays focussing on showbiz and streaming platforms, besides creating a Travel & Living supplement on Tuesdays.  Achievements and Setbacks  Quoting the Indian Readership Survey (IRS) for the year 2013, the Deccan Herald announced that it had \\"emerged as one of the top ten English dailies in the country\\". IRS 2013 termed the Deccan Herald as the eighth largest English-language daily in India, average issue readership-wise. The newspaper‚Äôs average issue readership stands at 4,58,000, including 3,38,000 in Bangalore city.\\" Deccan Herald was one of the early Indian newspapers to launch its own website, on April 15, 1996, and claims \\"14 million page views per month; over 1,200 stories are published every day with a contingent of about 750 journalists and contributors\\" as of 2018. It was one of the early publications to hire women journalists in India. Its Bengaluru printing is now done at Kumbalgodu, -- a town on the outskirts of Bengaluru, of over ten thousand population -- since 1998. It has been printing in colour in its main edition since 1985. Deccan Herald has also faced its own share of setbacks. Plans for both an evening English-language daily and a New Delhi edition did not succeed. Since the late 1990s, it has faced competition from other English-language newspapers entering the city.  Controversies  = Mohammad the Idiot = Mohammad the Idiot was a controversial short story published in the Sunday magazine supplement of the Deccan Herald newspaper in December 1986. The story was about a handicapped, half-witted boy named Mohammad who committed suicide due to the travails of his family suffering from poverty. It was a fictional story originally written by PKN Namboodri a decade earlier in Malayalam language and had nothing to do with the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It created no turmoil when first published in the Kannada language. However, Muslims in the city of Bengaluru took that story as a reference to their prophet and protested violently. Marchers went on a rampage and attacked police personnel in the city of Bengaluru, Mysore, and Mandya. Curfew was declared in Bengaluru and its suburban areas.

Early life He was born in Colchester, the only son of Wing Commander E. J. Sayer . He attended St Joseph's College, Nainital in India and Colchester Royal Grammar School in England. Career =Royal Air Force= Sayer joined the Royal Air Force on 30 June 1924, being granted a short service commission with the rank of probationary pilot officer, and was posted to No. 29 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Duxford. He was confirmed in his rank on 23 May 1925, and was promoted to flying officer on 30 March 1926. He learnt to fly in an Avro 504K, and later flew Sopwith Snipes, before becoming a test pilot at RAF Martlesham Heath, the home of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment. =Test pilot= Sayer was transferred to the Reserve of Air Force Officers (Class A) on 2 March 1929, to become second test pilot with Hawker Aircraft, assistant to Group Captain P. W. S. (George) Bulman (who first flew the Hurricane on 6 November 1935). He also competed in the 1930 King's Cup Air Race, flying the Cirrus Hermes-powered Desoutter Mk.I (G-AAPY) entered by Charles Bernard Wilson. He averaged over the course and came in 23rd place. In 1934 Hawker took over the Gloster Aircraft Company and Sayer was appointed chief test pilot in November 1934. On 2 March 1937 Sayer relinquished his reserve commission on completion of service, and was permitted to retain his rank. On 15 May 1941 at 7.45pm, he took off from RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire in the Gloster E.28/39 (W4041/G) powered by the W.1 engine and flew for 17 minutes, flying at over , impossible for other aircraft at the time in level flight. That Gloster aircraft has been in the Science Museum since 1946. A second aircraft of the same type (W4046/G) would be later demonstrated to Winston Churchill on 17 April 1943, having first flown on 1 March 1943 and later crashed in June 1943. On 21 October 1942 Sayer departed from RAF Acklington in a Hawker Typhoon to carry out tests of a gunsight involving gun firing into Druridge Bay Ranges, accompanied by another Typhoon. Neither aircraft returned, and it was assumed that they collided over the bay. He was replaced as Gloster's test pilot by Michael Daunt, who would be the first to fly the Gloster Meteor (powered by two de Havilland Goblin engines designed by Frank Halford) on 5 March 1943 at RAF Cranwell. Gloster E.28/39 memorial at Lutterworth. Personal life Sayer was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1942 New Years Honours List. In January 1929, he became engaged to May Violet Ellen Wallace-Smyth daughter of the vicar of Bures, north Essex. They were married on 7 June 1930 at Holy Innocents Church, Lamarsh in north Essex.

The badge is a light blue Maltese Cross with an imperial crown in the centre of the cross. The flag dates from 1876, with minor variations, and the badge was designed by William Hemmant, the Colonial Secretary and Treasurer of Queensland in 1876.  Separation flag, 1859  On 10 December 1859, \\"a light blue flag with a red St George's Cross and union in the corner\\" (now known as the Queensland Separation Flag) was flown in Brisbane at eight o'clock in the morning, to mark Queensland's separation from New South Wales.Moreton Bay Courier 05 November 1859  1870 flag  The State Flag was first created in 1870 with the Union Jack upon the royal blue background; however, the badge was not the current one.

It's one of the earliest titles for PS2's online service in North America. In addition to the 12 offline single player missions, SOCOM also featured online play via the Internet. SOCOM uses a USB headset for its speech recognition commands offline, and allows voice chat with teammates when playing online; this was the first game for the PlayStation 2 to use the headset. As of November 6, 2003, the game has sold two million copies worldwide. The online servers for this game, along with other PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable SOCOM titles, were shut down on August 31, 2012. Gameplay The player leads a four-man team (three AI-controlled teammates) of United States Navy SEALs through 12 missions in four regions: Alaska, Thailand, Congo, and Turkmenistan in the then-future of 2006 and 2007. In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases. The player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer (the Able element), while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission. Before each mission, the player may choose new equipment for himself and his teammates. Usually this consists of a primary and secondary weapon, along with two pieces of equipment like extra ammunition, explosives and so on. However, on some missions it is required that a team member carries a particular piece of equipment, such as C4 for destroying walls or vehicles. Characters are very vulnerable to enemy fire and may die after just a couple of shots, depending on where one is hit and what weapon is used. It is required that at least one teammate survives along with the player, if not the mission fails. At the end of each mission, the player is given a rating based on stealth, accuracy and teamwork. These ratings are alphabetical, with \\"A\\" being the highest grade. Once the game is completed for the first time, the player unlocks a higher difficulty and can try to complete the game again and again with a progressively higher difficulty. =Online gameplay= Online players choose one of two sides: SEALs or terrorists. Maps consist of three types: suppression (eliminate all members of the opposite team), extraction (rescue hostages) and demolition (capture a satchel and destroy the opposite team's base). SOCOM, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Confrontation and SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs for the PlayStation 3 are the only games in the series that do not support LAN play (local multiplayer). In addition to the specific game type, any of the three game modes may be won by eliminating all members of the opposing team. The online features of the game, however, are no longer accessible. Plot On November 27, 2006, a U.S. Navy SEAL fireteam consisting of Kahuna, Boomer, Spectre, and Jester is sent in to neutralize an emerging terrorist threat. A new group calling itself the Iron Brotherhood, made up of former Spetsnaz operatives, is using a barge as a base for buying and transporting weapons. They are making their trades with a known black market organization, the Zemy, and the two are rendezvousing in international waters off the coast of Alaska. The team are to eliminate the terrorists, gather intel, and scuttle the freighter. With the intel that the SEALs gathered, SOCOM is able to locate the Brotherhood's headquarters, a ghost town in Alaska. The team is tasked with securing the compound, destroying any weapon caches that are present, and detaining a terrorist named Kola Petrenko, codename Pincushion. Information from Pincushion revealed that the Brotherhood has taken control of an oil platform in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Most of the oil workers had been killed, but some are being held captive by the terrorists. The Brotherhood is also threatening to destroy the platform, which would result in a disastrous oil spill. The SEALs are sent in to infiltrate the platform and neutralize all threats, including the Brotherhood's leader, Stanislav, codename Spectrum. They are successful in taking down all of the terrorists and defusing all bombs on board. In Thailand, a group calling themselves the Riddah Rouge, led by a man named Sudarak Thongkon, has acquired sensitive and highly valuable biological data from a smuggler out of Sri Lanka. The terrorists murder him and his crew, then offload the data and move it deep into the jungles of Thailand. With a potential biological threat on their soil, the Thai government asks for assistance, and the United States responds by sending in the SEALs. Kahuna's team are inserted into the area and proceed to travel upriver to intercept and retrieve the data. After moving from one island to another and neutralizing numerous patrols, the team finds some documents. Unfortunately, only half of the bio data is among them as the other half had been moved elsewhere. With the bio data in their possession, the Riddah Rouge has taken the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand and his wife hostage. The terrorists demand ransom money and threaten to execute the two if their demands are not met. Intelligence tracks their movements and are able to locate the hostages at an abandoned temple in the jungles of Hohn Kaen. The team move in under cover of night and safely extract the Ambassador and his wife. While no ransom is paid for the pair, the Riddah Rouge manage to manufacture a small amount of biological agent. Their plan is to use the agents to destabilize the Thai government. The SEALs are assigned to assault another abandoned temple. While there, the team either captures or kills Thongkon, codename Bad Dog, and secures the biological agents. With their leader in custody, the Riddah Rouge disbanded. In the Congo, a new mercenary organization known as Preemptive Strike has established a base of operations deep in the jungle. They are recruiting European mercenaries and are actively stockpiling weapons and ammunition. Concerned about this new threat, the Congolese government has requested aid from the United States. The SEALs are sent in to recon and collect intel about the group. After disabling communications and destroying the enemy munitions in their staging area, the team finds out that the remaining mercenaries have ambushed and captured a patrol of U.S. Marines. The marines are being held at the mercenary base camp where they are being tortured for information. The SEALs are able to rescue the POWs and eliminate the mercenary leader Magnus, but not before finding out that one of the captive Marines is missing, having been moved to an abandoned German bunker built during World War I which contains a network of tunnels and pillboxes. This complex is no match for the SEALs however, and they successfully liberate the final Marine with the help of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets firing missiles at designated pillboxes. In Turkmenistan, members of a terrorist group, the Allah Sadikahu, have attained several portable nuclear devices from various black market organizations. An informant named Basim Maccek, codename Mr. Pickle, has knowledge about the nuclear devices moving through the region, but has gotten himself captured in the process. He is imprisoned in a Turkmen Detention Center in the mountains and the SEALs are sent in to release, escort, and extract the informant. The recovered informant confirms the presence of two suitcase nukes in Turkmenistan and their location. The Sadikahu have concealed the devices in a desert cave network close to the Afghan border. With no time to lose, the team travels to the nukes' location. After an intensive firefight, the team manages to destroy the nukes and the cave system. The Sadikahu's ruthless leader Mullah Bahir Al- Qadi, however, is not present at the caves. He and his brother Imad have retreated to a deserted bombed city in central Turkmenistan. Kahuna's team is once again sent in to find and neutralize the Al-Qadi brothers. The SEALs fight against countless terrorist defenders and race against the clock as Mullah and Imad Al-Qadi, codename Fat Cat and Kitten, call for helicopters to come and extract them. In the end, both brothers are killed and the mission is completed. Reception SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. By July 2006, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs had sold 1.4 million copies and earned $82 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 34th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of SOCOM releases reached 3.9 million units in the United States by July 2006.

The right of initiative is usually attributed to parliaments, which in most countries have the right to make law proposals, alone or sharing this right with the government. In parliamentary systems it is common that both the government (executive) and the parliament have legislative initiative, but it also can be restricted to the government and the lower house of parliament, or even to the government alone. In presidential systems legislative initiative usually only rests with the congress, such as in the United States. This, however, does not preclude the executive from suggesting the introduction of certain laws to their backers in the congress. Right of initiative in France In France, ministerial bills are called law projects and parliament's bills are called law proposals. =Law projects= In France, bills are proposed by the government. One of the ministers propose the bill to those concerned by his or her application. Then, if the different ministers agree, the bill is sent to the secr√©tariat g√©n√©ral du gouvernement and then to the Conseil d'√âtat, the Council of Ministers, Parliament, and so on... The Conseil d'√âtat (and sometimes the Constitutional Council) has the duty to advise the government on projects of law. =Law proposals= Any MP can propose a law to Parliament. Law proposals, unlike law projects, can be directly deposed if they do not increase the state's expenditure. Both kind of bills can first be deposed either to the Senate or the National Assembly Only 10% of laws that are passed are proposed by Members of Parliament. This is mainly because the government has several means to limit the power of Parliament: the Government fixes most of the agenda of both chambers, and the Government can, under certain conditions, prevent Parliament from modifying its texts. The legislative initiative of Parliament has both good and bad points. The principal criticism is that lobbies could persuade Parliament to satisfy them before other citizens. On the other hand, legislative initiative is the best way for Parliament to defend itself against possible encroachments to its power. Legislative initiative in the European Union The European Commission has the sole power of legislative initiative whereas in many Parliamentary systems there is a mechanism whereby members of the parliament may introduce bills. This ranges from insignificant in the UK Parliament (see Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom), to quite significant in the US Congress. In most parliaments, the ability of members to introduce legislation is severely limited in practice. Under the Treaty of Maastricht enhanced by the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has an indirect right of legislative initiative that allows it to ask the Commission to submit a proposal, though to reject the request the Commission only needs to \\"inform the European Parliament of the reasons\\".Article 225 TFEUEU Parliament - Legislative initiative procedure Member states also have an indirect right of legislative initiative concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Over 80% of all proposals by the Commission were initially requested by other bodies.Nugent, N: The European Commission (2001), S.236 Some politicians, including Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, feel that the Commission's monopoly on legislative initiative prevents the emergence or development of real democratic debate.

These rights are codified in national and international labor and employment law. In general, these rights influence working conditions in relations of employment. One of the most prominent is the right to freedom of association, otherwise known as the right to organize. Workers organized in trade unions exercise the right to collective bargaining to improve working conditions.  Labor background  Throughout history, workers claiming some sort of right have attempted to pursue their interests. During the Middle Ages, the Peasants' Revolt in England expressed demand for better wages and working conditions. One of the leaders of the revolt, John Ball famously argued that people were born equal saying, \\"When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?\\" Laborers often appealed to traditional rights. For instance, English peasants fought against the enclosure movement, which took traditionally communal lands and made them private. The British Parliament passed the Factory Act 1833 which stated that children under the age of 9 could not work, children aged 9‚Äì13 could only work 8 hours a day, and children aged 14‚Äì18 could only work for 12 hours a day. Labor rights are a relatively new addition to the modern corpus of human rights. The modern concept of labor rights dates to the 19th century after the creation of labor unions following the industrialization processes. Karl Marx stands out as one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for workers rights. His philosophy and economic theory focused on labor issues and advocates his economic system of socialism, a society which would be ruled by the workers. Many of the social movements for the rights of the workers were associated with groups influenced by Marx such as the socialists and communists. More moderate democratic socialists and social democrats supported worker's interests as well. More recent workers rights advocacy has focused on the particular role, exploitation, and needs of women workers, and of increasingly mobile global flows of casual, service, or guest workers. = International Labor Organization (ILO) = The International Labour Organization (ILO) was formed in 1919 as part of the League of Nations to protect worker's rights. The ILO later became incorporated into the United Nations. The UN itself backed workers rights by incorporating several into two articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the basis of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (article 6‚Äì8). These read: Article 23 # Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. # Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. # Everyone who works has the right to just and favorable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. # Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his/her interests. Article 24 # Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay. The ILO and several other groups have sought international labor standards to create legal rights for workers across the world. Recent movements have also been made to encourage countries to promote labor rights at the international level through fair trade. = International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF) = The International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF) is a nonprofit organization that works on labor rights. Their mission is to achieve dignity and justice for workers worldwide. By working with other organizations around the world, including labor unions and religious organizations, they are able to influence governments and companies for change.  Core labor standards  Identified by the ILO in the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, core labor standards are \\"widely recognized to be of particular importance\\".Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 1996 'Trade, Employment and Labour Standards: A Study of Core Workers' Rights and International Trade' They are universally applicable, regardless of whether the relevant conventions have been ratified, the level of development of a country or cultural values. These standards are composed of qualitative, not quantitative standards and don't establish a particular level of working conditions, wages or health and safety standards. They are not intended to undermine the comparative advantage that developing countries may hold. Core labor standards are important human rights and are recognized in widely ratified international human rights instruments including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC), the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 193 parties, and the ICCPR with 160 parties.Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ratification and Reservations: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ratification and Reservations: They have been incorporated into different provisions that are related to labor in soft law instruments such as the UN's Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines, and the ILO MNE Declaration. __The core labor standards are: * Freedom of association: ICCPR Art.22, ILO Convention 87 workers are able to join trade unions that are independent of government and employer influence; * The right to collective bargaining:ICCPR Art.22, ILO Convention 98 workers may negotiate with employers collectively, as opposed to individually; * The prohibition of all forms of forced labor:ICCPR Art. 8, ILO Conventions 29 and 105 includes security from prison labor and slavery, and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress; * Elimination of the worst forms of child labor:CROC Art. 32 ILO Convention 138 implementing a minimum working age and certain working condition requirements for children; * Non-discrimination in employment: equal pay for equal work. Very few ILO member countries have ratified all of these conventions due to domestic constraints yet as these rights are also recognised in the UDHR, and form a part of customary international law they are committed to respect these rights. For a discussion on the incorporation of these core labor rights into the mechanisms of the World Trade Organization, see Labour standards in the World Trade Organization. There are many other issues outside of this core, in the UK employee rights includes the right to employment particulars, an itemised pay statement, a disciplinary process at which they have the right to be accompanied, daily breaks, rest breaks, paid holidays and more.  Labor rights issues  Aside from the right to organize, labor movements have campaigned on various other issues that may be said to relate to labor rights. = Hour limits = Many labor movement campaigns have to do with limiting hours in the work place. 19th century labor movements campaigned for an eight- hour day. Worker advocacy groups have also sought to limit work hours, making a working week of 40 hours or less standard in many countries. A 35-hour workweek was established in France in 2000, although this standard has been considerably weakened since then. Workers may agree with employers to work for longer, but the extra hours are payable overtime. In the European Union the working week is limited to a maximum of 48 hours including overtime (see also Working Time Directive 2003). = Child labor = 11Rose Biodo, 1216 Annan St., Philadelphia. 10 years old. Working 3 summers. Minds baby and carries berries, two pecks at a time. Whites Bog, Brown Mills, N.J. This is the fourth week of school and the people here expect to remain two weeks more. Witness E. F. Brown. Location: Browns Mills, New Jersey / . Labor rights advocates have also worked to combat child labor. They see child labor as exploitative, and often economically damaging. Child labor opponents often argue that working children are deprived of an education. In 1948 and then again in 1989, the United Nations declared that children have a right to social protection. It is hard for children to fight for their basic rights, especially at the workplace. They are often being under-treated. Employers take advantage of child labor because they lack the ability to bargain collectively and compromise to work at an unpleasant workplace. Almost 95% of child labor occurs in developing countries. In India and Pakistan, children work long hours in various industries because of the debt their parents incurred.See Tucker, supra note 7, at 573; Weissman, supra note 7, at 11 ; Human Rights Watch, supra note 15, at 2; Cox, supra note 16, at 115. Poor families sometimes rely on their kids' income to pay bills.In Egypt, about 1.5 million kids under 14 years old are working even though there are child-protective labor laws.  Child labor in the United States  In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) restricts the employment of children. The FLSA defines the minimum age for employment to 14 years for non- agricultural jobs with restrictions on hours, restricts the hours for youth under the age of 16, and prohibits the employment of children under the age of 18 in occupations deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. In 2007, Massachusetts updated their child labor laws that required all minors to have work permits. = Workplace conditions = Labor rights advocates have worked to improve workplace conditions which meet established standards. During the Progressive Era, the United States began workplace reforms, which received publicity boosts from Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and events such as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Labor advocates and other groups often criticize production facilities with poor working conditions as sweatshops and occupational health hazards, and campaign for better labor practices and recognition of workers rights throughout the world. = Safety and social sustainability = Recent initiatives in the field of sustainability have included a focus on social sustainability, which includes promoting workers' rights and safe working conditions, prevention of human trafficking, and elimination of illegal child labor from the sustainably sourced products and services. Organizations such as the U.S. Department of Labor and Department of State have released studies on products that have been identified as using child labor and industries using or funded by human trafficking. Labor rights are defined internationally by sources such as the Norwegian Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DIFI) and the International Finance Corporation performance standards. = Living wage = The labor movement pushes for guaranteed minimum wage laws, and there are continuing negotiations about increases to the minimum wage. However, opponents see minimum wage laws as limiting employment opportunities for unskilled and entry level workers. The benefits and costs of foreign direct investments on labor rights are often argued. Payton and Woo's study shows that even though \\"workers may not see drastic increases in minimum wages but they will benefit marginally from better enforcement of existing minimum wage laws or other protections granted in law, gradually improving overall working conditions, as more FDI flows in.\\" = Migrant workers = Legal migrant workers are sometimes abused. For instance, migrants have faced a number of alleged abuses in the United Arab Emirates (including Dubai). Human Rights Watch lists several problems including \\"nonpayment of wages, extended working hours without overtime compensation, unsafe working environments resulting in death and injury, squalid living conditions in labor camps, and withholding of passports and travel documents by employers. Despite laws against the practice, employers confiscate migrant workers' passports. Without their passports, workers cannot switch jobs or return home. These workers have little recourse for labor abuses, but conditions have been improving. Labor and social welfare minister Ali bin Abdullah al-Kaabi has undertaken a number of reforms to help improve labor practices in his country. = Undocumented workers = The right to equal treatment, regardless of gender, origin and appearance, religion, sexual orientation, is also seen by many as a worker's right. Discrimination in the work place is illegal in many countries, but some see the wage gap between genders and other groups as a persistent problem. Many migrant workers are not getting basic labor rights mainly because they don't speak the local language, regardless of legal status. Some have noticed that they are not getting the correct amount of money on their paycheck while others are underpaid.  Undocumented workers in the United States  The National Labor Relations Act recognizes undocumented laborers as employees. However, the supreme court case Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB established that backpay could not be awarded to unlawfully fired undocumented employees due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In this court decision, it was also stated that the U.S. would support FLSA and MSPA, without regard to whether or not someone is documented. Undocumented workers also still have legal protection against discrimination based on national origin. The decision of the Hoffman supreme court case primarily has affected undocumented laborers by preventing them from getting backpay and/or reinstatement. While no undocumented individual is technically able to work in the United States legally, undocumented folks make up 5% of the workforce. In the U.S., people who were born outside of the country tend to work in riskier jobs and have a higher chance of encountering death on the job. The low wage sectors, which many undocumented folks work in, have the highest rates of wage and hour violation. Estimates claim that 31% of undocumented people work in service jobs. Restaurant work in particular has a 12% rate of undocumented workers. Undocumented people can and have joined labor unions, and are even credited by a 2008 dissertation for \\"reinvigorating\\" the labor movement. Because the NLRA protects undocumented workers, it protects their right to organize. However the NLRA excludes workers that are agricultural, domestic, independent contractors, governmental, or related to their employers. The right to speak up against labor abuses was protected further by an immigration reform bill in 2013 with the POWER act, which intended to protect employees who spoke out against labor practices from facing detention or deportation. However, labor unions are not necessarily welcoming of immigrant workers. Within unions, there have been internal struggles, such as when Los Angeles immigrant janitors reorganized service workers. Being a part of the union does not necessarily address all the needs of immigrant workers, and thus winning power within the union is the first step for immigrant workers to address their needs. Immigrant workers often mobilize beyond unions, by campaigning in their communities on intersectional issues of immigration, discrimination, and police misconduct. = Globalization = In March 2004, the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization issued a report called \\"A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All\\". The report acknowledges how potential globalization can affect labor rights. Reforming globalization will require cooperation not only within the country but also at the globa; level. It suggests political authorities to \\"renew their attention to global solidarity\\". Workers' rights advocates have been concerned with how globalization can impact labor rights in different countries. Some international agencies and global corporations see strong enforcement will limit a country's economic growth. As companies outsource their work to workers from lower-wage countries, governments will relax their regulation to attract businesses. As a result, poor countries implement a lower labor rights standard to compete with other countries. Layna Mosley's study shows that collective labor rights have declined since the recent global expansion started. By having multiple countries sign agreements and treaties, labor rights are able to be protected across the globe. However, some countries sign it even though they are not planning to follow the rules. Therefore, there might be room for labor rights practices to suffer. However, some argued that globalization can improve the labor right enforcement by responding to other country's demands. Governments will act in their national interests, so when an important trading country urges for strong labor rights enforcement, they will act accordingly.

It is a bus operator serving the county of Oxfordshire, England. It is a subsidiary of Stagecoach Group.  History  In 1987 Harry Blundred, a former bus driver and controller from Devon, founded both Thames Transit and the Oxford Tube. In 1997 Stagecoach Group bought both operations from Blundred and merged them with Stagecoach Midland Red. Stagecoach South Midlands operated four brands: *Oxford Tube for express buses between Oxford and London Victoria *Stagecoach in Banbury for local buses in and around Banbury *Stagecoach in Oxford for local buses in and around Oxford *Stagecoach in Warwickshire for local buses in Warwickshire In July 2002 the Banbury and Oxford brands were merged as \\"Stagecoach in Oxfordshire\\". In March 2004 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire and Stagecoach in Warwickshire were split into two divisions with those names. Stagecoach buses in Oxford, and from Oxford to Abingdon and Kidlington, compete with local buses operated by the Oxford Bus Company. Oxford is one of the few UK cities where such free and unsubsidised competition, as envisaged by the architects of bus deregulation in the 1980s, still exists. In 2010 it was announced that Oxford Bus Company and Stagecoach in Oxfordshire, in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council, had agreed a Bus Quality Partnership as enabled by the Local Transport Act 2008. The partnership would improved multi-operator ticketing across the City and co-ordinate bus timetables on the four busiest shared routes. On 15 July 2010 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire introduced a fleet of 26 Alexander Dennis Enviro400H diesel- electric hybrid buses on Oxford ‚Äì Cowley ‚Äì Blackbird Leys route 1 and Oxford ‚Äì Kidlington routes 7A/7B (now 2/2A/2B). Double deckers were chosen over single deckers as a result of the co-ordinated timetables and reduced frequencies to be introduced under the quality partnership. As newer buses joined the Oxfordshire fleet, the Enviro400H hybrids were transferred first to Oxford ‚Äì Rose Hill route 3, then to Kidlington ‚Äì Headington route 700 and now to Oxford ‚Äì Cowley ‚Äì Headington route 10. In October 2016 Stagecoach announced the introduction of new electronic ticket machines to enable passengers to pay by contactless payment card or by smartphone using Apple Pay or Google Pay. Stagecoach in Oxfordshire was the first Stagecoach division to receive these new machines for both local services and the Oxford Tube, making Stagecoach in Oxfordshire the first major operator to accept contactless payments outside London.  Oxford Tube  An Oxford Tube coach at Hillingdon Station The Oxford Tube currently operates a fleet of 24 Van Hool Astromega double decker coaches on limited stops services between Oxford and London Victoria. On 3 March 2014 Stagecoach Group announced its biggest vehicle order to date. Costing Stagecoach over ¬£100 million in total, it included 26 new VanHool TX Astromega coaches to operate the Oxford Tube service. The first of the new coaches entered service on 16 July 2014 with the entire fleet following shortly after. The new coaches increased comfort and facilities for passengers including more leg room, 4G WiFi, power sockets and USB ports in selected seats and a brand new audio information system providing passengers with departure and arrival information and the top deck also features a panoramic glass sun roof allowing more natural light into the coach. In 2020, Stagecoach announced that it would replace their current Tube fleet with 34 new Plaxton Panorama vehicles, built on Volvo B11RLE chassis.  Stagecoach Gold  Stagecoach Gold branded Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC bus on route 31 in Abingdon-on-Thames in June 2017 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire operates several routes under the premium Stagecoach Gold brand. The Stagecoach Gold brand was introduced in Oxfordshire in 2009 with the creation of the first S-Series (Superior Series) routes. The Stagecoach Gold brand is currently used on several long-distance routes in the county. The Gold branded buses feature a special Gold and blue coloured livery along with high-back leather seats and free on-board Wi-Fi. The newer Gold vehicles used on routes 7/S3, S4, S8, S9 and 34 also include USB charging ports. In addition to the routes operated by Stagecoach in Oxfordshire, Stagecoach West also operates route S6 which runs between Swindon and Oxford via Faringdon. = S3/NS3 ‚Äì Chipping Norton/Charlbury to Oxford = In 2008 route 20, operating between Chipping Norton and Oxford, and route 20A, operating between Charlbury and Oxford, were combined to create route S3 operating alternately Oxford ‚Äì Woodstock ‚Äì Charlbury and Oxford ‚Äì Woodstock ‚Äì Chipping Norton. The service also serves Blenheim Palace. Route S3 was upgraded to Stagecoach Gold status in September 2012 with the delivery of nine new Stagecoach Gold specification Enviro400 buses for the service. = S4/H4 ‚Äì Banbury to Oxford = In September 2011 Banbury ‚Äì Oxford routes 59/59A/59B were renumbered S4. In September 2015 route S4 was upgraded with new Gold-specification Scania K230UB buses with Alexander Dennis Enviro300 single-decker bodies. = S5/NS5 ‚Äì Bicester to Oxford = In 2009 routes 27/27A/27B between Bicester and Oxford were rebranded as route S5. The route was subsequently upgraded to Stagecoach Gold in January 2012 with a fleet of 11 new Gold branded Enviro400 buses. = 7/7A/N7 ‚Äì Woodstock/Yarnton to Oxford = Route 7 was a new route created in January 2017 between Woodstock and Oxford via Kidlington and . It competes with Oxford Park and Ride route 500 that Oxford Bus Company extended to Kidlington and Woodstock some weeks earlier. Route 7 was given Stagecoach Gold status with brand new Enviro400 MMC vehicles that were delivered to Stagecoach in Oxfordshire in December 2016. In April 2017 Oxford Bus Company announced that it would reduce the frequency of its service to Woodstock, as it was struggling to compete with routes 7 and S3. = S8/NS8/S9/X9/34 ‚Äì Wantage to Oxford = Routes X30, 31, and 34 between Wantage and Oxford were upgraded to Stagecoach Gold status in January 2017. The services received new Stagecoach Gold specification Enviro400 MMC vehicles that were delivered to Stagecoach in December 2016. Routes 31 and X30 were renumbered S8 & S9 respectively on 22 October 2017.  National Express  Stagecoach Oxfordshire operated route 737 from Oxford to Stansted Airport under contract to National Express from March 2007 until June 2013.  Fleet  Stagecoach Oxfordshire‚Äôs new buses: the Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 MMC bodied on route 7 in Summertown in November 2018 As of December 2016, Stagecoach Oxfordshire operated a fleet of 176 buses. Stagecoach Oxfordshire has a young fleet. This is partly due to Oxford's Low Emission Zone, which allows only buses with exhaust systems of at least Euro V standard or better to serve the city centre. Stagecoach Oxfordshire has replaced most of its fleet to meet this requirement.  Depots  Alexander Dennis Enviro 200 in Oxford in October 2014 Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 hybrid in Oxford in August 2010 *Banbury, Canal Street *Oxford, Horspath Road *Witney, Corn Street Oxford depot also has three out-stations at Bicester, Chipping Norton and Grove. Chipping Norton out-station is also used by Witney depot. Grove out-station houses the Wantage fleet. It also used to house the Didcot fleet, but Stagecoach no longer operates in Didcot.  Incidents  *In the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2010 Oxford Tube coach 50226 was involved in a serious accident on the M40 after a passenger on board attempted to grab the steering wheel. No-one was seriously injured, but the vehicle ended up on its side and sustained significant damage. The vehicle was eventually repaired and returned to service. *On 14 December 2010 a double deck bus on route S1 from Oxford to Witney was involved in a collision with a taxi on Oxford Hill junction with Cogges Hill Road in Witney. The elderly female taxi driver was freed with hydraulic cutting equipment and she was then taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital with suspected facial and leg injuries. Three passengers from the bus were taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution. *On 14 May 2012 the engine of bus 22766 caught fire in Cumnor while on route X30 from Wantage to Oxford. No passengers were injured in this incident and the bus was eventually repaired and returned to service. *On 4 October 2014 bus 15609 was involved in a collision with a car which resulted in both vehicles ending up in an embankment at the side of the A40 between Witney and Eynsham. As a result, the A40 was closed between Eynsham roundabout and Witney while emergency services dealt with the incident. No-one was seriously injured but a few people were taken to hospital as a precaution. The bus involved has since been repaired and returned to service.

The fighting began on 23 July with attacks by the British Reserve Army. The farm was captured by the 3rd Canadian Division of the Canadian Corps on 16 September. The farm was lost to a German counter-attack, before being re-captured on 26 September during an attack by the 11th (Northern) Division during the Battle of Thiepval Ridge No. 16 Section of the 6th Battalion East Yorkshire (Pioneers) smoked out the last German defenders. Background =1916= Mouquet Farm was to the right of the modern D 73 Pozi√®res‚ÄìThiepval road, south of Grandcourt and to the south-west of Courcelette, about north-west of the high ground near Pozi√®res. Following the fighting that had occurred around the village earlier in the year, a decision was made by the British to gain control of the ridge beyond the village to create a gap in the German lines, behind the salient that had developed around the German-held fortress of Thiepval. By capturing Mouquet Farm, the British hoped that it would destabilise the German position and enable subsequent gains. Battle =10 August ‚Äì 3 September= During the night of 10 August, parties of the 4th Australian Division of the I Anzac Corps, attacked towards the farm and managed to establish advanced posts in the valley south of the farm and to the east. Attacks were then made from a foothold in (Fabeck Trench) to the north-east and to deepen the salient near the farm. By 22 August, the 2nd Australian Division had made several more attempts on the farm and realised that the main defensive position was underground, where the Germans had excavated the cellars to create linked dug-outs. On 3 September, the 4th Australian Division attacked again with the 13th Brigade and captured much of the surface remains of the farm and trenches nearby, with hand-to-hand fighting in the ruins and underground. German counter-attacks repulsed the Australians except from a small part of , for a loss of casualties. =16‚Äì26 September= During the battle, the divisions of I Anzac Corps advanced north- west along the Pozi√®res ridge, towards Mouquet Farm, with British divisions supporting on the left. The approaches to the farm were watched by German artillery observers, who directed artillery-fire on the attackers from three sides of the salient that had developed in the lines. Many casualties were caused to the attackers as they approached the farm; in August and into September, the Australian divisions were repulsed three times from the farm. The Canadian Corps relieved the I Anzac Corps on 5 September. The Canadians captured part of the farm on 16 September and were then repulsed by a counter- attack. By 25 September, further attacks had captured part of the farm on the surface but the Germans still held the cellars, dug-outs and tunnels beneath. The farm was captured on 26 September by the 34th Brigade of the 11th (Northern) Division, in the general attack of the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. The 9th Lancashire Fusiliers bombed the exits of the underground positions and also managed to reach the second objective, at the west end of Trench, where German machine-gun nests had held up previous attacks. The 6th East Yorkshire (Pioneers) overwhelmed the last defenders with smoke grenades and took Aftermath =Casualties= In the fighting around Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm, the I Anzac Corps suffered During its second period on the Somme, the 1st Australian Division lost having already had in August. The 2nd Australian Division had from 25 July to 7 August and from 23 to 29 August. From 29 July to 16 August the 4th Australian Division suffered and another 27 August to 4 September.

The daughter of Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, consul in 19, Calvina belonged to two patrician houses: the gens Aemilia and gens Junia respectively. She was also the great-great-granddaughter of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus on her mother's side of the Imperial family. As such, she was also related by blood to the gens Julia, the aristocratic family of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Tacitus calls Calvina \\"festivissima puella\\" and the Emperor Vespasian, in one of his jokes, mentions her as living in AD 79.Tacitus. Annals, Book XII, paragraph 4; Suetonius, Vespasian, paragraph 23 Seneca describes her as \\"most celebrated of all women (she whom all called Venus).\\"Seneca, Apocolocyntosis, paragraph 8. Calvina was married to Lucius Vitellius, the brother of Aulus Vitellius, in the 1st century AD. Despite, or rather because of their blood relation to the first emperor of Rome, Calvina's close family was often persecuted by their kinsmen, particularly the lineal descendants of Livia Drusilla, Augustus' third wife and the first Roman empress. Calvina and Vitellius were divorced in AD 49 following allegations of incest with her younger brother, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, who was forced to commit suicide shortly thereafter. In the same year, Calvina was exiled from Rome by Emperor Claudius, only to be recalled a decade later by his successor, Nero. With Nero's suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty collapsed and gave way to the Roman civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. By then Calvina was one of Augustus' few remaining descendants who survived the fall of Rome's first Imperial dynasty.

Polyarteritis nodosa may be present in infants. In polyarteritis nodosa, small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary, therefore making \\"rosary sign\\" an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis. PAN is sometimes associated with infection by the hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. PAN is a rare disease. With treatment, five-year survival is 80%; without treatment, five-year survival is 13%. Death is often a consequence of kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Signs and symptoms  PAN may affect nearly every organ system and thus it can present with a broad array of signs and symptoms. These manifestations result from ischemic damage to affected organs, often the skin, heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Constitutional symptoms are seen in up to 90% of affected individuals and include fever, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. Muscle and joint aches are common. The skin may show rashes, swelling, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous nodules (lumps). Skin manifestations of PAN include palpable purpura and livedo reticularis in some individuals. Abdominal pain may also be seen. Nerve involvement may cause sensory changes with numbness, pain, burning, and weakness (peripheral neuropathy). Peripheral nerves are often affected and this most commonly presents as mononeuritis multiplex, which is the most common neurologic sign of PAN. Central nervous system involvement may cause strokes or seizures. Kidney involvement is common and often leads to death of parts of the kidney though kidney filtration function is often preserved. Involvement of the renal artery, which supplies the kidneys with highly oxygenated blood, often leads to high blood pressure in about one-third of cases. deposition of protein or blood in the urine may also be seen. Involvement of the arteries of the heart may cause a heart attack, heart failure, and inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis). =Complications= * Stroke * Heart failure due to cardiomyopathy and pericarditis * Intestinal necrosis and perforation Causes There is no association with ANCA, but about 30% of people with PAN have chronic hepatitis B and deposits containing HBsAg-HBsAb complexes in affected blood vessels, indicating an immune complex‚Äìmediated cause in that subset. Infection with the Hepatitis C virus and HIV are occasionally discovered in people affected by PAN. PAN has also been associated with underlying hairy cell leukemia. The cause remains unknown in the remaining cases; there may be causal and clinical distinctions between classic idiopathic PAN, the cutaneous forms of PAN, and PAN associated with chronic hepatitis. In children, cutaneous PAN is frequently associated with streptococcal infections, and positive streptococcal serology is included in the diagnostic criteria. Diagnosis Microscopic findings in polyarteritis nodosa: nodular thickened and branched arteries from small bowel mucosa (Fig. 1), flexor digitorum superficialis artery with early diffuse nuclear proliferation (X155; Fig. 2), nodular thickened and aneurysmal expanded artery: (a) tunica intima, (b) tunica media, (c) tunica adventitia, (d) newly formed connective tissue and fat (Fig. 3; X155) No specific lab tests exist for diagnosing polyarteritis nodosa. Diagnosis is generally based on the physical examination and a few laboratory studies that help confirm the diagnosis: :* CBC (may demonstrate an elevated white blood count) :* ESR (elevated) :* Perinuclear pattern of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) - not associated with \\"classic\\" polyarteritis nodosa, but is present in a form of the disease affecting smaller blood vessels, known as microscopic polyangiitis or leukocytoclastic angiitis :* Tissue biopsy (reveals inflammation in small arteries, called arteritis) :* Elevated C-reactive protein A patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if he or she has three of the 10 signs known as the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)American College of Rheumatology criteria, when a radiographic or pathological diagnosis of vasculitis is made: :* Weight loss greater than/equal to 4.5 kg :* Livedo reticularis (a mottled purplish skin discoloration over the extremities or torso) :* Testicular pain or tenderness (occasionally, a site biopsied for diagnosis) :* Muscle pain, weakness, or leg tenderness :* Nerve disease (either single or multiple) :* Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg (high blood pressure) :* Elevated kidney blood tests (BUN greater than 40 mg/dL or creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL) :* Hepatitis B (not C) virus tests positive (for surface antigen or antibody) :* Arteriogram (angiogram) showing the arteries that are dilated (aneurysms) or constricted by the blood vessel inflammation :* Biopsy of tissue showing the arteritis (typically inflamed arteries):Shiel, Jr., William C, http://www.medicinenet.com/polyarteritis_nodosa/article.htm The sural nerve is a frequent location for the biopsy.

In polyarteritis nodosa, small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary, therefore making \\"rosary sign\\" an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis. The 1990 ACR criteria were designed for classification purposes only. Nevertheless, their good discriminatory performances, indicated by the initial ACR analysis, suggested their potential usefulness for diagnostic purposes as well. Subsequent studies did not confirm their diagnostic utility, demonstrating a significant dependence of their discriminative abilities on the prevalence of the various vasculitides in the analyzed populations. Recently, an original study, combining the analysis of more than 100 items used to describe patients' characteristics in a large sample of vasculitides with a computer simulation technique designed to test the potential diagnostic utility of the various criteria, proposed a set of eight positively or negatively discriminating items to be used as a screening tool for diagnosis in patients suspected of systemic vasculitis. =Differential diagnosis= Polyarteritis nodosa rarely affects the blood vessels of the lungs and this feature can help to differentiate it from other vasculitides, which may have similar signs and symptoms (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis). Treatment Treatment involves medications to suppress the immune system, including prednisone and cyclophosphamide. When present, underlying hepatitis B virus infection should be immediately treated. In some cases, methotrexate or leflunomide may be helpful. Some patients have also noticed a remission phase when a four-dose infusion of rituximab is used before the leflunomide treatment is begun. Therapy results in remissions or cures in 90% of cases. Untreated, the disease is fatal in most cases. The most serious associated conditions generally involve the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. A fatal course usually involves gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, myocardial infarction, and/or kidney failure.Giannini, AJ; Black, HR. Psychiatric, Psychogenic and Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook. Garden City, NY. Medical Examination Publishing, 1978. Pp. 219‚Äì220. In case of remission, about 60% experience relapse within five years., Entry in Polyarteritis Nodosa Follow-up article In cases caused by hepatitis B virus, however, recurrence rate is only around 6%. , Entry in Polyarteritis Nodosa Follow-up article Epidemiology The condition affects adults more frequently than children and males more frequently than females. Most cases occur between the ages of 40 and 60. Polyarteritis nodosa is more common in people with hepatitis B infection.

It is owned by Curb Records. Word Entertainment represents Francesca Battistelli, for King & Country, Switchfoot, Skillet, Sidewalk Prophets, Chris August, Big Daddy Weave, in addition to many others, and is home to Word Distribution, 25 Live, Word Music Publishing and Word Label Group's Word Records and Fervent Records. History Word Records was founded in Waco, Texas, in 1951 by Jarrell McCracken, Baylor business major Henry SoRelle and radio and television executive Ted Snider.The Vernon Daily Record, Tue, December 4, 1951, Page 3 The label's name is based on a 16-minute spoken word recording written and narrated by McCracken, the first recording released by the label, entitled \\"The Game of Life\\". The 23-year-old KWTX sportscaster in Waco had read an article by Jimmy Allen, a former athlete who became a Baptist preacher, and based his recording on the article which also is called \\"The Game of Life\\". The event is based on a full length match between the forces of Good and Evil with Jesus Christ and Satan coaching the two teams. Subsequent records focused on other spoken word recordings, but Word soon branched out into southern gospel music. Early employees for the label included Tom Norfleet, Kurt Kaiser and Ralph Carmichael. The label struggled initially until Marvin Norcross became an equity partner. By 1954, Word had become a publishing house as well. Several subsidiary labels were started over the years: Canaan Records in the sixties, Myrrh Records (1972) and DaySpring Records in 1977, and Rejoice Records in the eighties. Two of these labels no longer exist today in their original form. The Myrrh Label was resurrected in 2005 as a praise and worship record label: Myrrh Worship. Larry Norman's Solid Rock Records had a distribution deal with Word from 1975 to 1980. Artists on Solid Rock included Norman, Randy Stonehill, Daniel Amos, Tom Howard and Mark Heard. Light Records was distributed in the 1970s by Word Records before being sold to Ralph Carmichael in the 1980s. Reunion Records signed a distribution and promotion contract in the 80s, the agreement lasted well into the 1990s. Today, Reunion Records is distributed through Provident Music Group. Star Song was distributed by Word Records but left their distribution deal in the late 1980s to sign with Sparrow Records which was taken over by Chordant Distribution and then by EMI. Distribution deals with other labels in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s allowed Word Records to rise, representing Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Rich Mullins, Russ and Tori Taff, Paul Smith, The Imperials, Petra, Sandi Patti, Kenny Marks, Wayne Watson, Carman, The Archers featuring Steve Archer, White Heart, Gaither Vocal Band, Bill Gaither Trio, Point of Grace, Love Song, Sweet Comfort Band, The Nelons, Happy Goodman Family featuring Rusty Goodman, Florida Boys, Guardian and other artists. In the 1976, McCracken sold part interest in his label to the American Broadcasting Company. 10 years later, ABC merged with Capital Cities, Inc. and forced McCracken out of the company. In 1983, Chris Christian signed a distribution deal to move his label Home Sweet Home Records from Benson Records to Word Records, today it is still active and remains under the independent ownership of Chris Christian. From 1984 to 1990, Word was distributed in the general market by A&M; Records and then by Epic Records until 2002. In 1992, Capital Cities ABC sold Word to Thomas Nelson, Inc. for $72 Million, and Nelson made two major changes‚Äîdeveloping the present swirling W logo for book products which was unveiled in 1995, and also moving its headquarters from Waco, Texas, to its present headquarters in Nashville. Nelson split the record label and book publishing arms in 1996 when the labels were sold to Gaylord Entertainment. In an agreement with Gaylord, Thomas Nelson continued to use the \\"Word Publishing\\" name for its book imprint until 2002, at which time it became \\"W Publishing Group\\" and retained the swirling W logo. A highly controversial ad campaign introduced at the CBA convention in 2002 created litigation, settled later. After Colin Reed took over Gaylord Entertainment in 2001, the hotelier made corporate changes at the company, including the ousting of longstanding president Roland Lundy, and sold off the Word Entertainment group to then-AOL Time Warner in 2002. In 2002, former Atlantic Records Christian division manager Barry Landis briefly took the position of president of the label group division. Word went through a period of restructuring, closing their Los Angeles music publishing office, absorbing Myrrh Records, Squint Entertainment, and Everland Entertainment into the Word Label Group, and reducing in-house staff. Curb Records also gained a stake in the company during this time. In 2004, the company was sold again as part of Time Warner divestiture of its music division, selling it to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman to form a newly independent Warner Music Group. Canaan Records was re-opened in early 2007 with Dave Clark at the helm. Canaan Records was eventually shuttered. In March 2016, it was announced that Mike Curb acquired 100 percent of Word Entertainment (excluding the print music division, which was eventually sold to The Lorenz Corporation) from Warner Music Group. WMG has continued to distribute Word's output for the general market. Also in 2016, it was announced that Joseph Prielozny, the former Reach Records producer, would be in charge of the hip-hop imprint which is to be called 4 Against 5.

AD 18 - 65) was a Roman noblewoman who lived in the first century. She was the second daughter of Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, one of the Junii Silani. Her maternal grandparents were Julia the Younger, granddaughter of the emperor Augustus, and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, consul in AD 1. Lepida married Gaius Cassius Longinus (c. 13 BC - AD 69), a person with remarkable ancestral wealth. Cassius was praefectus urbi circa AD 27, consul suffectus in AD 30, proconsul of Asia in 40 or 41, and governor of Syria between about AD 45 and 49. Lepida and Cassius raised Lepida's nephew, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, whose father was murdered by Empress Agrippina the Younger. In AD 66, Lepida's husband and nephew were expelled from Rome by Emperor Nero for being a part in Gaius Calpurnius Piso's conspiracy. Cassius was deported to Sardinia. Lepida was accused by Nero of black magic and incest with her nephew; her subsequent fate is unknown. Cassius was later rehabilitated, and recalled from exile by Vespasian. Lepida bore Longinus two children: * Cassia Longina (born c. AD 35), married the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, by whom she had two daughters: Domitia and Domitia Longina. * Cassius Lepidus (born c. AD 55), had a daughter, Cassia Lepida (born c. AD 80). She married Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus (born c. AD 80), consul in AD 116, and proconsul of Asia in AD 132, and had a daughter, Julia Cassia Alexandra.

Their intention was to be able to handle logistics needs without being dependent on local road or rail systems, allowing them to operate in back-country areas. The US Army had three experimental units built, the largest reaching almost long, which holds the record for the longest off- road vehicle. Road trains are in use in certain roles today, but the US Army examples and a few derivatives appear to be the only off-road examples built. History =LeTourneau= In the early 1950s, LeTourneau, Inc., a heavy- equipment maker based in Longview, Texas, developed the idea of using a diesel-electric transmission to drive multi-wheeled vehicles. Each wheel was driven by a separate electric motor, which gave the vehicles much better traction as the force of the engine was spread across a number of wheels. In general terms these vehicles were similar to the diesel-electric locomotives that were being widely introduced by the railways at the same time, but they replaced the steel wheels with rubber ones. The earliest vehicles using the system were a number of 6x6 graders, wheel tractor-scrapers and other earthmovers. In 1953, R. G. LeTourneau sold the earthmoving portions of the business to Westinghouse, a sale that included a five-year moratorium before LeTourneau could sell into the market again. While the moratorium ran out, LeTourneau developed a number of new vehicles based on the same drivetrain. These included a number of special-purpose military designs like launchers for the Corporal missile, engineering vehicles that could quickly haul crashed bombers off of runways, and even an enormous vehicle intended to pick up beached landing craft. =VC-12 Tournatrain = The overland train concept first developed as a way to haul trees out of the bush, without the need to prepare a road capable of supporting a traditional truck. A truck would need to have a surface flat and strong enough for its driven wheels, normally four at the rear of the cab, to gain traction needed to climb any grades. With multiple driven wheels, LeTourneau's 6x6 diesel-electrics were an obvious solution, but a single vehicle was too small to justify their purchase costs. The solution was to turn the 6x6 into an extendable design, using flexible connections to allow any number of driven wheels to be added, as needed. The first of these designs was the VC-12 Tournatrain, which consisted of a power truck with a 500-hp Cummins VT-12 engine, and three 20-ton trailers. Each wheel was powered by a separate electric motor, four to each vehicle, including the locomotive. First tested in February 1953, after several months of testing, an additional four trailers were added, with the last holding a second engine. The new version was completed in February 1954, and supported a maximum payload of 140 tons. =VC-22 Sno-Freighter, the DEW line= LeTourneau Snow Train During this period the U.S. and Canada were in the process of developing the DEW Line, which was located in areas with no roads, few airbases, and in areas where the sea ice often prevented ships from accessing the sites. On 15 April 1954 the company demonstrated VC-12 to the US Army Transportation Research and Development Command, or TRADCOM, proposing that the system would be useful for logistics operations in the arctic if equipped with more wheels. TRADCOM offered funding to create the TC-264 Sno- Buggy, which had eight huge rubber tires, arranged in pairs and driven by four motors powered by a single Allison V-1710 engine running on butane. The resulting vehicle has an enormous amount of tire area to vehicle weight, allowing it to float on the tundra and snow. First unveiled in June 1954, the Sno-Buggy was sent to Greenland for testing. Alaska Freight Lines of Seattle had contracted with Western Electric to provide 500 tons of equipment to the DEW stations being built in the Alaska sector. Hearing of the VC-12, on 5 January 1955 they signed a contract with LeTourneau for the construction of the VC-22 Sno-Freighter. The contract called for a single locomotive and six cars able to haul 150 tons, cross rivers up to deep, cut through snow drifts and operate at temperatures as low as -68 degrees F (-55.5¬∞C). The locomotive provided AC power from 400-hp Cummins NVH-12 engines, powering its own four wheels and the five four-wheeled trailers, forming a train. Since the VC-22 was based almost entirely on existing parts from their 6x6 vehicles, even the tires, the company was able to deliver it with surprising speed. It was completed on 17 February 1955, painted, and then sent to Alaska on the 21st. The vehicle served well throughout 1955, but in the second season of use a fire consumed the locomotive's power generation section and the remains were pulled out of Canada.Cliff Bishop, \\"Eighteen Wheels North to Alaska - A History of Trucking in Alaska\\", Publication Consultants, 2009 pp. 51-52,71-74 When Alaska Freight Lines's contract with Western Electric ran out it was soon left to rot. Today it sits abandoned outside Fairbanks, Alaska near the Steese Highway. On their own initiative, LeTourneau took the basic VC-22, changed the engine to the 600-hp VT-12, and changed the trailers to side-dumping bins to produce a Side-Dump Train. The six-wheeled locomotive also had its own bin, and could operate independently. Completed in October 1955, the company was still under the moratorium period and could not sell it for earthmoving, and the train saw no orders. =LCC-1 Sno-Train = thumbA LeTourneau LCC-1 Sno- Train on display at the Yukon Transportation Museum in Whitehorse Impressed with the results of the Sno-Buggy, in late 1954 the Army Transportation Corps asked LeTourneau to combine the features of the Tournatrain and Sno-Buggy into a new vehicle. LeTourneau called the result the YS-1 Army Sno-Train but the Army knew it as the Logistics Cargo Carrier, or LCC-1. The LCC-1 combined the wheels of the Sno-Buggy with the power system of the Tournatrain to produce a 16x16 vehicle with one locomotive and three cars capable of handling a load of 45 tons in total. The control cab was itself articulated into two compartments; a heated driving compartment in front for the crew of three, and a rear section containing the 600-hp diesel engine, generators and fuel tanks. The cab also sported a powered crane on the rear. In spite of starting the project before the VC-22, the LCC-1 required much more customization, and was not completed until January 1956. After testing at the factory, it was handed over to the Army in March, and continued testing in snow at the TRADCOM proving grounds in Houghton, Michigan. After acceptance, it was sent to Greenland, and then traveled around the north for some time, making its last cargo run in 1962. The LCC-1 eventually ended up abandoned in a salvage yard right behind Fort Wainwright, Fairbanks, Alaska. Despite the years of neglect, the LCC-1 still has its 10 foot tall wheels as well as its generators. In addition to the LCC-1's primary drive unit, there are also ten of its original trailers in the Fort Wainwright yard, which is not far from the site where the VC-22 sits abandoned. Today, the LCC-1 now has a permanent site at the Yukon Transportation Museum in Whitehorse, Yukon where people can marvel at its uniqueness while driving past on the Alaska Highway. =TC-497 Overland Train, Mk II= LCC-1 was so successful that in 1958 the Army contracted for a larger version, the TC-497 Overland Train Mark II. Generally similar to the LCC-1 in concept, the Mark II included a number of features to allow the train to grow to any length. One change was the removal of the Cummins engines and their replacement with gas turbine engines of higher power and lower weight. Whereas the LCC-1 had a single 600-hp engine, the Overland Train had four 1,170-hp Solar 10MC engines, one in the \\"control car\\" and three others spread through the train. New power trailers could be added at any point along the train. To further reduce weight, most of the vehicle was built from welded aluminum.Welding Engineer, Volume 47 (1962), p. 49 Steering such a train proved to be a serious problem. If the train rounded a corner, the trailers would normally want to even the angles between themselves, forming into a long arc. If there was an obstacle that the driver had avoided, the trailers might eventually hit it as they rounded a corner. To solve this problem, the new trailers were all equipped with steerable wheels. Steering commands were sent from the control cab to each set of wheels in turn, so they started turning at the same point where the driver had. This allowed the train to make sharp right-angle turns, for instance. The Mark II had a much larger six-wheeled cab that was over tall and was no longer articulated due to the ability for all the wheels to be steered. The turbine engine was much smaller than the diesel it replaced, allowing the interior to support a crew of six with sleeping quarters, toilets and a galley. It was even equipped with a radar. An additional two power cars and ten cargo cars were built for testing. In total the train now stretched over . On flat ground it could carry 150 tons of cargo at about 20 mph. Range at full load was normally , but additional fuel trailers could be added to extend it. Final specifications were completed in 1960, and construction took most of 1961. After preliminary testing, it was handed to the Army in February 1962, and shipped to the Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona. In testing under the \\"Project OTTER\\", for \\"Overland Train Terrain Evaluation Research\\", the vehicle performed well. But in the end the Army gave up on the idea as newer heavy-lift helicopters like the S-64 Skycrane made the train concept outdated. The vehicle remained unused for a time, and was then put up for sale for $1.4 million in 1969.\\"If you can pay for it, it's yours\\", Product Engineering, Volume 40 (1969), p. 106 All that remains of the Mark II is the control cab which remains at Yuma, the rest was sold off to a local scrap dealer. The Mark II retains the record for the longest offroad vehicle in the world.Nick Georgano, \\"Transportation Through the Ages\\", McGraw-Hill, 1972, p. 69  See also  * Antarctic Snow Cruiser * Long combination vehicle * Road train * Trackless train  Sources  *  References   Further reading  * John Shamburger and Charles Kolb, \\"Project OTTER: Overland Train Terrain Evaluation Research\\", T.R.

She was later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS St Albans (I15), as a , but spent most of the war in the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy, before transferred to the Soviet Navy as Dostoyny. Service history =As USS Thomas= Named after Clarence Crase Thomas, she was laid down on 23 March 1918 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company; launched on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Evelyn M. Thomas, widow of Lieutenant Thomas; and commissioned on 25 April 1919, Lieutenant Commander Harry A. McClure in command. Thomas operated off the east coast on training cruises and exercises until decommissioned at Philadelphia on 30 June 1922. During this service, she was classified DD-182 during the Navy-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920. She lay in reserve in the Philadelphia Navy Yard's back channel for the next 18 years. Recommissioned on 17 June 1940 ‚Äì as the United States Navy expanded to meet the demands imposed by Neutrality Patrols off American coastlines ‚Äì Thomas was assigned to Destroyer Division 79 of the Atlantic Squadron and operated briefly in training and exercises off the eastern seaboard until transferred to the United Kingdom under the \\"destroyer-for-bases\\" agreement. She arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 18 September 1940 as part of the second increment of the 50 flush-decked, four-piped destroyers exchanged with the British for leases on strategic base sites in the western hemisphere. After a brief familiarization period for the Royal Navy bluejackets assigned to the ship, Thomas was officially turned over to her new owners on 23 September 1940. Her name was subsequently struck from the United States Navy list on 8 January 1941. =As HMS St Albans= Simultaneously renamed HMS St Albans (I15) and commissioned the same day for service in the Royal Navy, the destroyer sailed for the British Isles on 29 September. After calling at St. John's, Newfoundland, en route, she arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 9 October. St Albans and three sister ships ‚Äì HMS St Mary's, HMS Bath, and HMS Charlestown ‚Äì were attached to the 1st Minelaying Squadron as permanent escort force. Operating off the west coast of Scotland, the destroyers participated in some of the earliest minelaying operations in the Denmark Strait which separates Iceland from Greenland. Between minecraft escort missions, St Albans escorted convoys. On 17 and 18 January 1941, the destroyer searched for survivors from , torpedoed by on 17 January. St Albans underwent repairs at Chatham in February to prepare for her transfer to the Royal Norwegian Navy- in-exile on 14 April. =As HNoMS St. Albans= St. Albans had no sooner entered service with the Norwegians than she collided with the minesweeping trawler HMS Alberic, sinking the trawler and sustaining enough damage herself to necessitate repairs in the dockyard. When again ready for action, HNoMS St Albans joined the 7th Escort Group, operating out of Liverpool. On 12 June, she picked up the survivors from the sunken steamship ‚Äì torpedoed that day by the ‚Äì and brought them safely to Liverpool. On 3 August 1941, while bound from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom in the screen of convoy SL 81, St Albans joined the destroyer and the in sinking . During subsequent operations screening convoys in shipping lanes between West Africa and the British Isles, St Albans made a score of attacks on U-boats but could not repeat her \\"kill\\" performance of 3 August. During the following autumn, a heavy gale severely damaged St Albans while she was escorting convoy ON 22 on 8 October. The following day brought little respite from the high seas and strong winds, but St Albanss Norwegian sailors brought her safely into Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. The destroyer's seaworthiness and the seamanship exhibited by her Norwegian crew elicited a warm commendatory signal from the Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches (C-in-C WA). In this message of 12 October 1941, he also praised the destroyer's exemplary steaming performance during the previous three months. St Albans, meanwhile, continued her escort duties with the 7th Escort Group into 1942. In March, she escorted the damaged aircraft carrier from Liverpool to the Clyde and, in the following month, helped to screen convoy PQ 15 as it carried arms to Russia. During the operation, heavy German air and submarine attacks took a toll of three Allied ships. In wartime, however, mistakes in identification or errors in navigation sometimes lead to disaster. On one occasion, these factors combined with tragic results when St Albans and the minesweeper sank the Polish submarine on 2 May. Five crewmen were killed. A court of Enquiry found that JastrzƒÖb was 100 miles out of position, in an area where U-boats were expected to operate, and no blame could be attached to either commander.Paul Kemp : Convoy! Drama in Arctic Waters p47 (1993) However this conclusion is disputed by other sources.According to Jerzy Pertek, \\"Wielkie dni ma≈Çej floty\\", Pozna≈Ñ 1976, p.325 (Polish) they were found guilty on 13 July 1942, that they had no right to attack submarines in that sector and the commander of \\"St. Albans\\" did not know recognition signs. Later that month, the flush-decked destroyer joined the Liverpool Special Escort Division. Among the vessels escorted early in June was the Cunard-White Star liner , as the Cunarder steamed from the British Isles toward the Cape of Good Hope with troops bound for the Middle East. Then, after refitting at Falmouth between July and October 1942, St Albans again operated with the Special Escort Division until the end of 1942. In January 1943, she served as a target vessel for training RAF Coastal Command aircraft. Late in February, she got underway and steamed into the North Sea toward the Scandinavian coast to search for a Norwegian merchantman which was reportedly attempting to escape to sea from German-controlled waters. During this mission, the destroyer was attacked by German aircraft but emerged unharmed. Shifted to the Western Local Escort Force soon thereafter, St Albans was based at Halifax and operated in convoy escort missions in the western Atlantic for the remainder of 1943. Departing Halifax four days after Christmas 1943, St Albans arrived in the Tyne on 10 January 1944, where she was soon laid up in reserve. =As Dostoyny= On 16 July 1944, the British transferred St Albans to the Soviet Navy, who renamed her Dostoyny (rus. –î–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π–Ω—ã–π, \\"Worthy\\"). She was returned to the British on 28 February 1949 at Rosyth, Scotland. This veteran of service with four different navies ‚Äì those of the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Soviet Union ‚Äì was eventually broken up for scrap at Charlestown in April 1949.

Pyrography or pyrogravure is the free handed art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker. It is also known as pokerwork or wood burning. The term means \\"writing with fire\\", from the Greek pur (fire) and graphos (writing).Marianne Podgorski; Before You Pick Up That Nib: Wood Burning 101, p7 It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying lens. \\"Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork.\\"\\"Pyrography.\\" Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. London: Chambers Harrap, 2012. Credo Reference. Web. 2 Mar 2015. A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured hardwoods such as sycamore, basswood, beech and birch are most commonly used, as their fine grain is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, pine or oak, are also used. Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. Leather lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern tanning methods leave chemicals in the leather which are toxic when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast. Pyrography is also popular among gourd crafters and artists, where designs are burned onto the exterior of a dried hard-shell gourd.  History  The Tawny Eagle. Davide Della Noce pyrography. The process has been practiced by a number of cultures including the Egyptians and some African tribes since the dawn of recorded history. Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesizes that the art form dates back to prehistory when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires.Boyer, R; The Amazing Art of Pyrography, Evanston 1993, It was known in China from the time of the Han dynasty, where it was known as \\"Fire Needle Embroidery\\".China Culture - pyrography During the Victorian era, the invention of pyrography machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term \\"pyrography\\" was coined (previously the name \\"pokerwork\\" had been most widely used) In the late 19th century, a Melbourne architect by the name of Alfred Smart discovered that water-based paint could be applied hot to wood by pumping benzoline fumes through a heated hollow platinum pencil.Carter, Julie; With Mellow Shades and Character Made: The Richness of Australian Pokerwork in Carter's Antiques and Collectables Magazine, Sept 2000 This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and shading that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and Art Nouveau pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. Pyrography is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Flanders, as well as Argentina and other areas in South America. Pyrographic Leopard Equipment Traditional pyrography can be performed using any heated metal implement. Modern pyrography machines exist, and can be divided into three main categories. =Solid-point burners= Solid-point burners are similar in design to a soldering iron. They have a solid brass tip which is heated by an electrical element, and operate at a fixed temperature. =Wire-nib burners= Wire-nib burners have variable temperature controls. The writing nib is heated by an electric current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable nibs to allow for different effects.Walters, S; Pyrography Workbook: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning Fox Chapel 2005 p13-14 =Laser cutters= Laser cutters can be set to scorch the material instead of cutting all the way through it. Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood. Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform pyrography on thin card or even paper. = Woods = Woods differ in hardness, grain, figure, texture, color, and other physical characteristics.Donohue, Nanette. \\"Woodburning Project & Pattern Treasury: Create Your Own Pyrography Art With 70 Mix-And-Match Designs.\\" Library Journal 137.4 (2012): 96. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Dec. 2015. Hardness: All woods can be classified into hard or soft. Usually softwoods are from coniferous (needle-leaved) trees. You may be aware of a little bit of resin oozing and also, a slight turpentine smell when you burn on softwood. Hardwoods are from broad-leaved trees. These hardwood trees can be classified into two distinct growing seasons each year (hot and cold season or a wet and dry season) such as: * Earlywood: normally lighter in color and weight and only moderately strong * Latewood: usually heavier, darker, and much stronger. Softwood will burn faster than a hardwood does. It does not require very hot temperature to burn as do the hardwoods. Grain: Grain is the direction of the fibrous elements of the wood cells. This is important to sand with the grain. Also the grain can cause deviation from its intended path with use of woodturning pen unless you apply more pressure and burn slower on the grain. Figure: This is the natural design, or pattern, that you can see on the cut surface of the wood. The figure present on the wood should always be taken into consideration when you are planning your woodburned design. Texture: There is a texture on the surface of that wood that feels either coarse or fine, even or uneven. As a beginning woodburner, avoid using very fine or intricate designs on uneven, coarse-textured wood. Softwoods are more apt to be fine or moderately coarse-textured. With some textures it may mean that you will have to compensate when burning it ‚Äì going slower on the harder summerwood, faster and with a lighter touch on the softer springwood to create an even burn overall. Color: Woodburning should be mainly used to enhance the natural beauty of a wooden project, so do not always hide a beautiful figure, grain, luster, or color if it is present.  Safety  The main hazard to be wary of is the extremely fine wood dust when sanding the wood or in some cases the pitch/sap or resin that emits harmful fumes when burning. All wood dust is hazardous & can cause respiratory problems if you do not wear a mask, some more than others & should be avoided. You should always wear a quality dust mask/respirator while power carving, and use a good dust collection system to avoid a lifetime injury to your lungs. These recommendations really are not just for power carving or sanding, but they should be used for burning as well. Remember: * DO NOT burn on pressure-treated wood. It is treated with chemicals that, although safely bound in the wood fibers for construction purposes, are inherently dangerous to woodworkers and woodburners. * DO NOT burn on any type of treated wood: Chemically treated, stained, painted, sealed with a finish, etc. If you must use this type of wood be sure that you have thoroughly sanded it to remove all traces and are burning on bare wood. Prepared Wood, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), man made boards and plywood should never really ever be burned on for several reasons. Prepared wood usually has been chemically treated and burning on it will release toxins into the air. MDF is made out of toxic materials and may cause cancer and other health issues. Man-made boards and such also have layers of glue that releases toxins that may not cause immediate harm but impact one later on in life. Regardless of what you decide, it is always important to work in a well ventilated room with a running fan to encourage the circulation of fresh oxygen and to remove the lingering smoke.

The degree to which a person is affected, however, may vary from mild to severe. Complications may include breathing problems, problems seeing, cleft palate, and hearing loss. Those affected generally have an average intelligence. TCS is usually autosomal dominant. More than half the time it occurs as a result of a new mutation rather than being inherited from a person's parents. The involved genes may include TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D. Diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and X-rays, and potentially confirmation by genetic testing. Treacher Collins syndrome is not curable. Symptoms may be managed with reconstructive surgery, hearing aids, speech therapy, and other assistive devices. Life expectancy is generally normal. TCS occurs in about one in 50,000 people. The syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins, an English surgeon and ophthalmologist, who described its essential traits in 1900. Signs and symptoms The same child shown from the front above in infobox, now seen from the side, with small ears and a chin that is far back. Symptoms in people with Treacher Collins syndrome vary. Some individuals are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed, while others have moderate to severe facial involvement and life-threatening airway compromise. Most of the features of TCS are symmetrical and are already recognizable at birth. The most common symptom of Treacher Collins syndrome is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone. This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted. The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases, trouble breathing or swallowing. The respiratory system of a child with Treacher Collins syndrome is the primary concern when the child is born and other concerns are addressed after respiratory issues have been addressed.Mouthon, L., Busa, T., Bretelle, F., Karmous‚ÄêBenailly, H., Missirian, C., Philip, N., & Sigaudy, S. (2019). Prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia in 41 fetuses: Retrospective analysis of outcome and genetic etiologies. American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A, 179(12), 2365‚Äì2373. doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.61359 Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance. The external ear is sometimes small, rotated, malformed, or absent entirely in people with TCS. Symmetric, bilateral narrowing or absence of the external ear canal, is also described. In most cases, the bones of the middle ear and the middle ear cavity are misshapen. Inner ear malformations are rarely described. As a result of these abnormalities, a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss. Most affected people also experience eye problems, including colobomata (notches) in the lower eyelids, partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid, downward angled eyelids, drooping of upper and lower eyelids, and narrowing of the tear ducts. Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus, refractive errors, and anisometropia. It can also be caused by severely dry eyes, a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections. Although an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for Treacher Collins syndrome, brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed. Cleft palate is also common. Dental anomalies are seen in 60% of affected people, including tooth agenesis (33%), discoloration (enamel opacities) (20%), malplacement of the maxillary first molars (13%), and wide spacing of the teeth. In some cases, dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion. This can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth. Less common features of TCS may add to an affected person's breathing problems, including sleep apnea. Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing or absence of the choanae, the internal opening of the nasal passages, which may also be observed. Underdevelopment of the pharynx can also narrow the airway. Features related to TCS that are seen less frequently include nasal deformities, high-arched palate, macrostomia, preauricular hair displacement, cleft palate, hypertelorism, notched upper eyelid, and congenital heart defects. Although facial deformity is often associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, more than 95% of people affected with TCS have normal intelligence. The psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity can affect quality of life in individuals with TCS. Genetics autosomal-dominant pattern. Mutations in TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D genes can cause Treacher Collins syndrome. TCOF1 gene mutations are the most common cause of the disorder, with POLR1C and POLR1D gene mutations causing an additional 2% of cases. In individuals without an identified mutation in one of these genes, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown. The TCOF1, POLR1C, and POLR1D genes code for proteins which play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. Mutations in these genes reduce the production of rRNA, which may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues. It is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development. Mutations in TCOF1 and POLR1D cause the autosomal dominant form of Treacher Collins, and mutations in POLR1C cause the autosomal recessive form. = TCOF1= TCOF1 is the primary gene associated with TCS; a mutation in this gene being found in 90-95% of the individuals with TCS.Katsanis SH, et al., Treacher Collins syndrome, 2004, GeneReviews However, in some individuals with typical symptoms of TCS, mutations in TCOF1 have not been found. Investigation of the DNA has resulted in the identification of the kind of mutations found in TCOF1. The majority of mutations are small deletions or insertions, though splice site and missense mutations also have been identified. Mutation analysis has unveiled more than 100 disease-causing mutations in TCOF1, which are mostly family-specific mutations. The only recurrent mutation accounts for about 17% of the cases. TCOF1 is found on the 5th chromosome in the 5q32 region. It codes for a relatively simple nucleolar protein called treacle, that is thought to be involved in ribosome assembly. Mutations in TCOF1 lead to haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein. Haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism has only one functional copy of a gene, because the other copy is inactivated by a mutation. The one normal copy of the gene does not produce enough protein, causing disease. Haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein leads to a depletion of the neural crest cell precursor, which leads to a reduced number of crest cells migrating to the first and second pharyngeal arches. These cells play an important role in the development of the craniofacial appearance, and loss of one copy of treacle affects the cells' ability to form the bones and tissues of the face.Gorlin RJ, Syndromes of the Head and Neck, 2001, Oxford University Press, 4th edition =Other mutations= POLR1C and POLR1D mutations are responsible for a minority of cases of Treacher Collins. POLR1C is found on chromosome 6 at position 6q21.2 and POLR1D is found on chromosome 13 at position 13q12.2. Those genes code for a protein subunits shared between RNA polymerase I and III. Both of these polymerases are important for ribosome biogenesis. Diagnosis =Genetic counseling= TCS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and the penetrance of the affected gene is almost complete. Some recent investigations, though, described some rare cases in which the penetrance in TCS was not complete. Causes may be a variable expressivity, an incomplete penetrance or germline mosaicism. Only 40% of the mutations are inherited. The remaining 60% are a result of a de novo mutation, where a child has a new mutation in the responsible gene and did not inherit it from either parent. In the outcome of the disease, inter- and intrafamilial variability occurs. This suggests that when an affected child is born, it is important to investigate the parents to determine whether the affected gene is present, because the parent could have a mild form of the disease that has not been diagnosed. In this case, the risk of having another affected child is 50%. If the parents do not have the affected gene, the recurrence risk appears to be low. In following generations, the severity of the clinical symptoms increases. = Prenatal diagnosis = Mutations in the main genes responsible for TCS can be detected with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Rare mutations may not be detected by these methods. Ultrasonography can be used to detect craniofacial abnormalities later in pregnancy, but may not detect milder cases. =Clinical findings= TCS is often first suspected with characteristic symptoms observed during a physical exam. However, the clinical presentation of TCS can resemble other diseases, making diagnosis difficult. The OMENS classification was developed as a comprehensive and stage-based approach to differentiate the diseases. This acronym describes five distinct dysmorphic manifestations, namely orbital asymmetry, mandibular hypoplasia, auricular deformity, nerve development, and soft-tissue disease.Vento AR, et al., The O.M.E.N.S classification of hemifacial microsomia, 1991, Cleft Palate Craniofac, J 28, p. 68-76 Orbital symmetry *O0: normal orbital size, position *O1: abnormal orbital size *O2: abnormal orbital position *O3: abnormal orbital size and position Mandible *M0: normal mandible *M1: small mandible and glenoid fossa with short ramus *M2: ramus short and abnormally shaped #2A: glenoid fossa in anatomical acceptable position #2B: Temperomandibular joint inferiorly (TMJ), medially, anteriorly displaced, with severely hypoplastic condyle *M3: Complete absence of ramus, glenoid fossa, and TMJ Ear *E0: normal ear *E1: Minor hypoplasia and cupping with all structures present *E2: Absence of external auditory canal with variable hypoplasia of the auricle *E3: Malposition of the lobule with absent auricle, lobular remnant usually inferior anteriorly displaced Facial nerve *N0: No facial nerve involvement *N1: Upper facial nerve involvement (temporal or zygomatic branches) *N2: Lower facial nerve involvement (buccal, mandibular or cervical) *N3: All branches affected Soft tissue *S0: No soft tissue or muscle deficiency *S1: Minimal tissue or muscle deficiency *S2: Moderate tissue or muscle deficiency *S3: Severe tissue or muscle deficiency =Radiographs= A few techniques are used to confirm the diagnosis in TCS. An orthopantomogram (OPG) is a panoramic dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional image from ear to ear. Particularly, OPG facilitates an accurate postoperative follow-up and monitoring of bone growth under a mono- or double-distractor treatment. Thereby, some TCS features could be seen on OPG, but better techniques are used to include the whole spectrum of TCS abnormalities instead of showing only the jaw abnormalities. Another method of radiographic evaluation is taking an X-ray image of the whole head. The lateral cephalometric radiograph in TCS shows hypoplasia of the facial bones, like the malar bone, mandible, and the mastoid. Finally, occipitomental radiographs are used to detect hypoplasia or discontinuity of the zygomatic arch. =CT scan= A temporal- bone CT using thin slices makes it possible to diagnose the degree of stenosis and atresia of the external auditory canal, the status of the middle ear cavity, the absent or dysplastic and rudimentary ossicles, or inner ear abnormalities such as a deficient cochlea. Two- and three-dimensional CT reconstructions with VRT and bone and skin-surfacing are helpful for more accurate staging and the three-dimensional planning of mandibular and external ear reconstructive surgery. =Differential diagnosis= Other diseases have similar characteristics to Treacher Collins syndrome. In the differential diagnosis, one should consider the acrofacial dysostoses. The facial appearance resembles that of Treacher Collins syndrome, but additional limb abnormalities occur in those persons. Examples of these diseases are Nager syndrome and Miller syndrome. The oculoauriculovertebral spectrum should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. An example is hemifacial microsomia, which primarily affects development of the ear, mouth, and mandible. This anomaly may occur bilaterally. Another disease which belongs to this spectrum is Goldenhar syndrome, which includes vertebral abnormalities, epibulbar dermoids and facial deformities. Treatment The treatment of individuals with TCS may involve the intervention of professionals from multiple disciplines. The primary concerns are breathing and feeding, as a consequence of the hypoplasia of the mandibula and the obstruction of the hypopharynx by the tongue. Sometimes, they may require a tracheostomy to maintain an adequate airway, and a gastrostomy to assure an adequate caloric intake while protecting the airway. Corrective surgery of the face is performed at defined ages, depending on the developmental state. An overview of the present guidelines: *If a cleft palate is present, the repair normally takes place at 9‚Äì12 months old. Before surgery, a polysomnography with a palatal plate in place is needed. This may predict the postoperative situation and gives insight on the chance of the presence of sleep apnea (OSAS) after the operation. *Hearing loss is treated by bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and educational intervention to avoid language/speech problems. The bone-anchored hearing aid is an alternative for individuals with ear anomalies. *Zygomatic and orbital reconstruction is performed when the cranio-orbitozygomatic bone is completely developed, usually at the age of 5‚Äì7 years. In children, an autologous bone graft is mostly used. In combination with this transplantation, lipofilling can be used in the periorbital area to get an optimal result of the reconstruction. Reconstruction of the lower eyelid coloboma includes the use of a myocutaneous flap, which is elevated and in this manner closes the eyelid defect. *External ear reconstruction is usually done when the individual is at least eight years old. Sometimes, the external auditory canal or middle ear can also be treated. *The optimal age for the maxillomandibular reconstruction is controversial; as of 2004, this classification has been used: #Type I (mild) and Type IIa (moderate) 13‚Äì16 years #Type IIb (moderate to severe malformation) at skeletal maturity #Type III (severe) 6‚Äì10 years *When the teeth are cutting, the teeth should be under supervision of an orthodontist to make sure no abnormalities occur. If abnormalities like dislocation or an overgrowth of teeth are seen, appropriate action can be undertaken as soon as possible. *Orthognatic treatments usually take place after the age of 16 years; at this point, all teeth are in place and the jaw and dentures are mature. Whenever OSAS is detected, the level of obstruction is determined through endoscopy of the upper airways. Mandibular advancement can be an effective way to improve both breathing and √¶sthetics, while a chinplasty only restores the profile. *If a nose reconstruction is necessary, it is usually performed after the orthognatic surgery and after the age of 18 years. *The contour of the facial soft tissues generally requires correction at a later age, because of the facial skeletal maturity. The use of microsurgical methods, like the free flap transfer, has improved the correction of facial soft tissue contours. Another technique to improve the facial soft tissue contours is lipofilling. For instance, lipofilling is used to reconstruct the eyelids. =Hearing loss= Hearing loss in Treacher Collins syndrome is caused by deformed structures in the outer and middle ear. The hearing loss is generally bilateral with a conductive loss of about 50-70 dB. Even in cases with normal auricles and open external auditory canals, the ossicular chain is often malformed. Attempts to surgically reconstruct the external auditory canal and improve hearing in children with TCS have not yielded positive results. Auditory rehabilitation with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) or a conventional bone conduction aid has proven preferable to surgical reconstruction. =Psychiatric= The disorder can be associated with a number of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, social phobia, and distress about body image; people may also experience discrimination, bullying, and name calling, especially when young. A multi- disciplinary team and parental support should include these issues. Epidemiology TCS occurs in about one in 50,000 births in Europe. Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in one in 10,000 to one in 50,000 births. History The syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins (1862‚Äì1932), the English surgeon and ophthalmologist who described its essential traits in 1900. In 1949, Adolphe Franceschetti and David Klein described the same condition on their own observations as mandibulofacial dysostosis. The term mandibulofacial dysostosis is used to describe the clinical features. Media portrayals A July 1977 New York Times article\\"Surgical Teamwork Gives Disease Victims a New Life\\" , Donald G. McNeil, Jr., July 26, 1977, page L31. that was reprinted in numerous newspapers nationwide over the ensuing weeks brought this malady to many people's attention for the first time. The disorder was featured on the show Nip/Tuck, in the episode \\"Blu Mondae\\". TLC's Born Without a Face features Juliana Wetmore, who was born with the most severe case in medical history of this syndrome and is missing 30%‚Äì40% of the bones in her face. In 2010, BBC Three documentary Love Me, Love My Face covered the case of a man, Jono Lancaster, with the condition. In 2011, BBC Three returned to Jono to cover his and his partner Laura's quest to start a family, in So What If My Baby Is Born Like Me?, which first aired as part of a BBC Three season of programmes on parenting. The first film was replayed on BBC One shortly ahead of the second film's initial BBC Three broadcast.

Voter turnout was considered high despite widespread concerns of violence. Voter suppression is a strategy used to influence the outcome of an election by discouraging or preventing specific groups of people from voting. It is distinguished from political campaigning in that campaigning attempts to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through persuasion and organization, activating otherwise inactive voters, or registering new supporters. Voter suppression, instead, attempts to reduce the number of voters who might vote against a candidate or proposition. The tactics of voter suppression range from minor changes to make voting less convenient, to physically intimidating and even physically attacking prospective voters, which is illegal. Voter suppression can be effective if a significant number of voters are intimidated or disenfranchised. In 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Shelby v. Holder that voting laws had resulted in voter suppression and discrimination. Examples =Australia= In Australia citizens are expected to enroll to vote and it is their responsibility to update their enrollment when they change their address. Even so, it is estimated that about 6% of eligible Australian voters are not enrolled, or are enrolled incorrectly. These are disproportionately younger voters, many of whom might neglect to enroll when they attain voting age. In 2006, the Howard Government legislated to close the electoral roll much earlier once an election was called. While previously, voters had been allowed seven days of grace after an election had been called to arrange or update their enrollment, new voters were now allowed only until 8:00 pm on the day that the electoral writ was issued to lodge their enrollment form, while those who needed to update their addresses were allowed three days. In Australia, the Prime Minister effectively has the right to determine the date of the election, so long as constitutional rules regarding the maximum term of the parliament are adhered to. This measure was therefore likely to result in many newer voters being precluded from voting in the first election for which they were eligible because the time to arrange their enrollment once an election is called had been greatly reduced. The measure was widely seen as an attempt at voter suppression aimed at younger voters,Orr, Graeme \\"Court by surprise: the High Court upholds voting rights\\", 6 August 2010. surveys had shown that younger voters are more likely than the general population to vote for the Australian Labor Party, or the Greens then the opposition.Brooker, Ron \\"Youth Federal Election Voting Intentions: A Statistical and Graphical Analysis of Newspoll Quarterly Data 1996‚Äì2010\\", The Whitlam Institute, June 2011 The Government denied that they were trying to suppress some voters, insisting that the purpose of the reform was to smooth the administration of elections and to reduce the possibility of electoral fraud. This was in spite of the fact that the Australian Electoral Commission had requested no such reform, there was no evidence of significant electoral fraud and that the Australian Electoral Commission had been dealing with hundreds of thousands of late enrollments without significant problems for decades. In July 2010, the left- leaning lobby group GetUp! launched a challenge to this law. The High Court of Australia expedited the hearing so that a ruling could be made in time for the 2010 federal election. The majority ruling struck down early closing of the roll, reinstating the old rule allowing voters seven days grace to arrange or update their enrollment. Australian citizens of the ages 16 or 17 can enroll onlineenroll online so that when they turn 18 they are able to vote. = Canada = Shortly before the Canadian 2011 Federal Election, vote suppression tactics were exercised by issuing robocalls and live calls to notify voters that their polling station had changed. The locations offered by these messages were intentionally false, often to lead voters several hours from the correct stations, and often identified themselves illegally as coming from Elections Canada. In litigation brought by The Council of Canadians, a federal court found that such fraud had occurred and had probably been perpetrated by someone with access to the Conservative Party's voter database, including its information about voter preferences. The court stated that the evidence did not prove that the Conservative Party or its successful candidates were directly involved. It did, however, criticize the Conservative Party for making ‚Äúlittle effort to assist with the investigation‚Äù. The court did not annul the result in any of six ridings where the fraud had occurred, because it concluded that the number of votes affected had been too small to affect the outcome. = Israel = In April 2019, during Israel's general elections for the 21st Knesset, Likud activists installed hidden cameras in polling stations in Arab communities. Election observers were seen wearing such cameras. Hanan Melcer, the Head of the General Elections Committee, said the cameras were illegal. The following day, PR agency Kaizler Inbar took credit for the operation and said it had been planned in collaboration with Likud. They additionally claimed that voter turnout in Arab communities had fallen under 50% thanks to the presence of the agency's observers in the polling stations, though there is little evidence that the cameras had any effect on the voter turnout, as the Arab population had been promising to boycott the election well in advance. = Poland = Shortly before the Polish Presidential Elections 2020, vote suppression tactics were exercised by issuing order that certain groups of voters, e.g. elderly voters, are given right to bypass any potential queue and vote first. =United Kingdom= Lutfur Rahman was the directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets for the Labour Party, in London until he was removed from office for breaching electoral rules. His supporters allegedly intimidated voters at polling stations. Current proposals by the Conservative Party to require one of several forms of expensive photo-ID in order to vote are likely to reduce the turnout of young and poor voters more likely to vote Labour. =United States= In the United States, elections are administered locally, and forms of voter suppression vary among jurisdictions. At the founding of the country, the right to vote in most states was limited to property-owning white males.Bret Carroll. American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia. SAGE Publications; 14 October 2003. . p. 89. Over time, the right to vote was formally granted to racial minorities, women, and youth.Christina Rivers.

Most of these voter suppression tactics were made illegal after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 2013, discriminatory voter ID laws arose following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which some argue amount to voter suppression among African-Americans. In Texas, a voter ID law requiring a driver's license, passport, military identification, or gun permit, was repeatedly found to be intentionally discriminatory. The state's election laws could be put back under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, however, the DOJ has expressed support for Texas's ID law. Sessions was accused by Coretta Scott King in 1986 of trying to suppress the black vote. A similar ID law in North Dakota, which would have disenfranchised large numbers of Native Americans, was also overturned. In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state's restrictive voter ID law led to \\"real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities\\"; and, given that there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, found that the law was \\"a cure worse than the disease.\\" In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law cut back on early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters. Other controversial measures include shutting down Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices in minority neighborhoods, making it more difficult for residents to obtain voter IDs; shutting down polling places in minority neighborhoods; systematically depriving precincts in minority neighborhoods of the resources they need to operate efficiently, such as poll workers and voting machines; and purging voters from the rolls shortly before an election. Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such laws even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, \\"We've not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa.\\" In May 2017, President Donald Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission is led by Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck's algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives. Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas. Coronavirus pandemic and voting by mail, 2020 US election The outbreak of COVID-19 may potentially make it difficult for the upcoming 2020 United States election. State and local elections executive are implementing changes in the voting process that are different from how it was before. The large numbers of COVID-19 cases has postponed primary elections. Voting by mail has become an increasingly common practice in the United States, with 25% of voters nationwide mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has been predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places. This method of voting- by-mail may potentially be limited to residents. For the 2020 election, a state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans are eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 - more than double the number in 2016.[76] Thus, the voting suppression in 2020 will exclude minorities groups such as homeless people, lower socioeconomic groups, and people that are unable to registered to vote via the internet. An example is the state of New York, with a high spike of COVID cases, have tried to cancel their primary elections and switched to voting-by-mail. The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots. The House voted to include an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots. Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, and said he will not grant any additional funding because he wanted to prevent any increase in balloting by mail. As reported on the site Common Dreams as an example of occurrences across the country, the head of the Iowa Postal Workers Union \\"alleged [Tuesday August 11, 2020] that mail sorting machines are 'being removed' from Post Offices in her state due to new policies imposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major GOP donor to President Donald Trump whose operational changes have resulted in dramatic mail slowdowns across the nation. Asked by NPR's Noel King whether she has felt the impact of DeJoy's changes, Iowa Postal Workers Union President Kimberly Karol‚Äîa 30-year Postal Service veteran‚Äîanswered in the affirmative, saying 'mail is beginning to pile up in our offices, and we're seeing equipment being removed.' Karol went on to specify that 'equipment that we use to process mail for delivery'‚Äîincluding sorting machines‚Äîis being removed from Postal Service facilities in Iowa as DeJoy rushes ahead with policies that, according to critics, are sabotaging the Postal Service's day-to-day operations less than 90 days before an election that could hinge on mail-in ballots.\\" See also * American Center for Voting Rights * Electoral fraud * Gerrymandering * Political corruption * Voter caging * Voter ID laws in the United States * Voter turnout References External links * Category:Political campaign techniques Category:Political corruption Category:Electoral fraud Category:Discrimination Category:Injustice ","title":"Voter suppression"},{"id":"1125783","text":"BUP may refer to: *.bup, a type of backup information file used in DVD video *bup, backup software that uses Git packfiles for storage *Bononia University Press, an Italian University Press and art book publisher *Baltic University Programme, a network of about 225 universities and other institutes of higher education in the Baltic Sea region *Bangladesh University of Professionals, a public university of Bangladesh *Banque de l'Union Parisienne, a French investment bank *Bucknell University Press, a publisher of books about the humanities and social and biological sciences ","title":"BUP"},{"id":"1125784","text":"Prince Micha≈Ç Jerzy Poniatowski (12 October 1736 - 12 August 1794) was a Polish nobleman.

He was later employed by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, and worked for 8 years in Korea on the multiplayer first-person shooter Tactical Intervention. He is a contractor on the multiplayer survival first-person shooter Rust. In the small-team games that he has worked on, Le has been a programmer, modeler, and designer. His nickname comes from Shane Gooseman, one of the main characters of 1980s cartoon series The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers. Biography Minh Le was born on 27 June 1977, in Vietnam. In 1979, he and his parents left Vietnam on a boat and immigrated to Canada as refugees. Le attended Simon Fraser University from 1996 to 2001, graduating in 2001 with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Computing Science. His curriculum and electives were \\"focused mainly on computer graphics courses covering subjects such as compression algorithms, 3D animation techniques, image recognition.\\"Mihn Le, LinkedIn. Le picked up id Software's Quake in 1996 and began playing with its software development kit, and after about a year he completed his first mod, Navy SEALs, Counter-Strikes spiritual predecessor. While he was working on the Action Quake 2 mod, he came up with the idea for Counter-Strike and became friends with Action Quake 2s webmaster Jess Cliffe and Marcelo Dilay. Le began work on Counter-Strike as a mod for Half-Life while he was in the middle of his fourth year at Simon Fraser University (he later graduated with a degree in computer science). He spent about 20 hours a week on making the mod, expending more effort on it than he did on his schoolwork, and released the first beta version in June 1999. The \\"Counter-Strike Team\\" quickly produced several more beta releases in the following months as the game's popularity skyrocketed. By the fourth beta version, Valve, the developer who created Half-Life, began assisting in the development of Counter-Strike. In 2000, Valve bought the rights to Counter- Strike and hired Le and Cliffe to work with them in Bellevue, Washington, where Le continued to work on Counter-Strike and related games. During this time he was developing Counter-Strike 2, however Valve eventually put this project on hold indefinitely. After Counter-Strike 2 was shelved, Le left Valve in 2006 to work on a project of his own. After two years working with a small team on this project, he moved to South Korea in 2008 to work with a business named FIX Korea who provided funding for further development. Le's new game was later revealed to be Tactical Intervention, a game similar in style to Counter-Strike created with a modified version of Valve's Source engine. In October 2013, he joined Facepunch Studios, where he worked on Rust.https://www.facepunch.com/team/member/minh.le/ He left Facepunch Studios in February 2018.https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/devblog-196/#Goosey_Going In March 2018, he joined Pearl Abyss to start working on a new project for the game studio that made the MMORPG Black Desert Online. Recognition In 2003, a GameSpy editorial cited Minh Le as the most important reason Half-Life was still popular five years after it was released.

In the British Army, the Horse Guards comprised several independent troops raised initially on the three different establishments. In the late 1660s, there were thus three troops in England, one in Ireland, and two in Scotland of which one was ceremonial for attendance of Lord High Commissioner (named after John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton and after John Leslie, 7th Earl of Rothes). In 1707, there were four troops of Horse Guards (the three original English and one Scots), and two troops of Horse Grenadiers. From 1658 to 1788, the Horse Guards existed as independent troops. They were placed on the English establishment in 1661, with the founding of the modern Regular British Army. In 1788, as part of the re-organisation of the British Army, the remaining 1st and 2nd Troops were united with the 1st and 2nd Troops of Horse Grenadier Guards to form, respectively, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards. Originally, as befitted their role as bodyguards to the Sovereign, the ranks of these Troops were filled by members of the gentry. They, therefore, had no non-commissioned officers,Cannon, Richard (1840), Historical record of The Life Guards: containing an account of the formation of the corps in the year 1660 and of its subsequent services to 1836.

History  Heidelberg began in 1862 as a trading station built by a German, Heinrich Julius Ueckermann. A town was laid out around the store and named after Ueckermann's alma mater. In 1866, the District of Heidelberg was created from the eastern portion of the Potchefstroom district with its own landdroost (magistrate) having been laid out as a churchplace in 1865. Heidelberg is some 50 kilometres south-east of Johannesburg, close to the Mpumalanga border. Just south of the town is the De Hoek toll plaza on the newest section of the N3, which opened in December 2001. Heidelberg sits nestled at the eastern end of the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, a large tract of land that is home to Gauteng's highest point, almost 2,000 metres above sea level. 100th anniversary of Susan, a class 12AR locomotive built in 1919 to work on the coal minesReefsteamers celebrates Susan the Steam Train‚Äôs 100th Birthday! Heidelberg has played an important part in South African history acting as a capital for the Boer republic during the war with Great Britain. During the First War of Independence, Heidelberg served as capital of the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek under the Triumvirate of Paul Kruger, P.J. Joubert and M.W. Pretorius, from 1880 to 1883. In 1885 the Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in the Heidelberg district and the office of the Mining Commissioner was established there. Heidelberg developed as a typical rural Victorian town. Many buildings dating back to the period between 1890 and 1910 have been preserved. In addition, Heidelberg was home to A.G. Visser, a well loved medical doctor and famous Afrikaans poet. His home (only open to the public by appointment) can still be seen situated close to the main road through town. Historical landmarks in the town includes A.G. Visser's bust and the Klipkerk. The British built a concentration camp here during the Second Boer War to house Boer women and children. A monument was erected in the main cemetery to the memory of the women and children. A monument was erected by the current ANC-led municipality in the late 1990s. It commemorates the black women and children who also died during the war. Other famous people that lived in Heidelberg is the opera singer Emma Renzi, Protea bowler Fanie de Villiers, religious leader Justice Tsungu, actors George Ballot, Zach du Plessis, Magda van Biljon and Rhyno Hatting, springbok rugby player Ockie Oosthuizen, writer PG du Plessis and mountain biker Melt Swanepoel. The \\"Jo'burg to Sea\\" mountain bike stage race starts in Heidelberg. There is every year a \\"Varkfees\\" festival with singers from all around South Africa performing at this festival. The \\"Outdoor X\\" show is held just outside Heidelberg on the Malonjeni Guest Farm. The far right secessionist political organisation (and former paramilitary group) the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) was founded by the late white supremacist and white separatist leader Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche in Rensburg (a suburb of Heidelberg).

These include national symbols of historical importance, goals, and political policies. The best-known is the swastika of Nazism. Common symbols of fascist movements Organized fascist movements have militarist-appearing uniforms for their members; use historical national symbols as symbols of their movement; and use orchestrated rallies for propaganda purposes. Fascist movements are led by a \\"Leader\\" (e.g. Duce, F√ºhrer, Caudillo) who is publicly idolized in propaganda as the nation's saviour. A number of fascist movements use a straight-armed salute. The use of symbols, graphics, and other artifacts created by fascist, authoritarian and totalitarian governments has been noted as a key aspect of their propaganda. Most fascist movements adopted symbols of Ancient Roman or Greek origin, for example the German use of Roman standards during rallies and the Italian adoption of the fasces symbol. The Spanish Falange took its name from the Spanish word for the Greek phalanx. Militarist uniforms with nationalist insignia Organized fascist movements typically use military-like uniforms with the symbol of their movement on them. In Italy, the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 wore black military-like uniforms, and were nicknamed Blackshirts. In power, uniforms during the Fascist era extended to both the party and the military which typically bore fasces or an eagle clutching a fasces on their caps or on the left arm section of the uniform. In Germany, the fascist Nazi movement was similar to the Italian Fascists in that they initially used a specifically colored uniform for their movement, the tan- brown colored uniform of the SA paramilitary group earned the group and the Nazis themselves the nickname of the Brownshirts. The Nazis used the swastika for their uniforms and copied the Italian Fascists' uniforms, with an eagle clutching a wreathed swastika instead of a fasces, and a Nazi flag arm sash on the left arm section of the uniform for party members. Other fascist countries largely copied the symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark blue shirts for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore blue shirts. Berets were also used, representing their Carlist supporters. The Spanish Blue Division expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WWII in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore blue shirts, berets and their army trousers. Fascist use of heraldry Fascist governments often saw the need to change the heraldry of their nations; in Germany, the arms of Coburg, featuring the head of Saint Maurice, was looked down upon for its religious and un-Aryan nature. It was replaced in 1934 with a coat of arms featuring a sword and swastika. Thuringia also saw the need to support the Nazi regime by adding a swastika to the paws of the lion on its coat of arms. In Italy, the chief of a coat of arms is often used to indicate political allegiance. Under the government of Mussolini, many families and locales adopted a red chief charged with a fasces to indicate allegiance to the National Fascist Party; this chief was called the capo del littorio. Francisco Franco, Chief of State of Francoist Spain, used a personal coat of arms featuring the Royal Band of Castile, a heraldic symbol used by the Crown of Castile.Standard of the Head of State 1940-1975 (Spain), CRW Flagswww.generalisimofranco.com, Arms image Flag of the National Fascist Party, bearing the fasces, which was the primary symbol of Italian Fascism. A perched eagle clutching a fasces was a common symbol used on Italian Fascist uniforms. Italy The original symbol of fascism in Italy under Benito Mussolini was the fasces. This is an ancient Imperial Roman symbol of power carried by lictors in front of magistrates; a bundle of sticks featuring an axe, indicating the power over life and death. Before the Italian Fascists adopted the fasces, the symbol had been used by Italian political organizations of various political ideologies (ranging from socialist to nationalist), called Fascio (\\"leagues\\") as a symbol of strength through unity. Italian Fascism utilized the color black as a symbol of their movement, black being the color of the uniforms of their paramilitaries, known as Blackshirts. The blackshirt derived from Italy's daredevil elite shock troops known as the Arditi, soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms.Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Fascism and culture. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. p. 207. The colour black, as used by the Arditi, symbolized death.Stanley G. Payne. A history of fascism, 1914-1945. Oxon, England, UK: Digital Printing, 2005. Pp. 90. Other symbols used by the Italian Fascists included the aquila, the Capitoline Wolf, and the SPQR motto, each related to Italy's ancient Roman cultural history, which the Fascists attempted to resurrect. Germany Flag of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), bearing the swastika, the premier symbol of Nazism which remains strongly associated with it in the Western world. NSDAP Parteiadler eagle The nature of German fascism, as encapsulated in Nazism was similar to Italian Fascism ideologically and borrowed symbolism from the Italian Fascists such as the use of mass rallies, the straight-armed Roman salute, and the use of pageantry. Nazism was different from Italian Fascism in that it was officially racist. Its symbol was the swastika, at the time a commonly seen symbol in the world that had experienced a revival in use in the western world in the early 20th century. German v√∂lkisch Nationalists claimed the swastika was a symbol of the Aryan race, who they claimed were the foundation of Germanic civilization and were superior to all other races. As the Italian Fascists adapted elements of their ethnic heritage to fuel a sense of Nationalism by use of symbolism, so did Nazi Germany. Turn-of-the-century German-Austrian mystic and author Guido von List was a big influence on Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, who introduced various ancient Germanic symbols (filtered through von List's writings) most thoroughly into the SS, including the stylized double Sig Rune (von List's then-contemporary Armanen rune version of the ancient sowilo rune) for the organization itself. The black-white-red tricolor of the German Empire was utilized as the color scheme of the Nazi flag. The color brown was the identifying color of Nazism (and fascism in general), due to its being the color of the SA paramilitaries (also known as Brownshirts). Other historical symbols that were already in use by the German Army to varying degrees prior to the Nazi Germany, such as the Wolfsangel and Totenkopf, were also used in a new, more industrialized manner on uniforms and insignia. Although the swastika was a popular symbol in art prior to the regimental use by Nazi Germany and has a long heritage in many other cultures throughout history - and although many of the symbols used by the Nazis were ancient or commonly used prior to the advent of Nazi Germany - because of association with Nazi use, the swastika is often considered synonymous with National Socialism and some of the other symbols still carry a negative post-World War II stigma in Western countries, to the point where some of the symbols are banned from display altogether.http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/24/germany_banned_its_ugly_historic_symbols_should_we_do_that_too.html Flag of the Spanish Falange, bearing the yoke and arrows, the premier symbol of Falangism. Spain The fascist Falange in Spain utilized the yoke and arrows as their symbol. It historically served as the symbol of the shield of the monarchy of Ferdinand and Isabella and subsequent Catholic monarchs, representing a united Spain and the \\"symbol of the heroic virtues of the race\\".Wendy Parkins. Fashioning the body politic: dress, gender, citizenship. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2002. Pp. 178 The original uniform of the Falangistas was the blue shirt ‚Äì derived from the blue overalls of industrial workers ‚Äì which was later combined with the red beret of the Carlists to represent their merger by Franco. Poland Several Polish far- right and nationalist organizations have used the Mieczyk Chrobrego ([Boleslaus] the Brave's Sword), which resembles the Szczerbiec, or the coronation sword of Polish kings. The same organisations have used the falanga sword, a symbol associated with the extreme right in the country after Mieczyk Chrobrego was banned; most notably it is used by the ONR and NOP as their main identifying symbols. Among other symbols Toporze≈Ç is also used, a symbol with strong anti-Semitic connotations. Other regions Symbol of the Croatian Usta≈°e. Many other fascist movements did not win power or were relatively minor regimes in comparison and their symbolism is not well-remembered today in many parts of the world, although the BUF's Flash and Circle was later used by the non-fascist People's Action Party of Singapore. * The symbol of the Bulgarian national-socialist Ratnik movements was a sun cross named \\"Bogar\\". * Lightning bolts were a common symbol of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, appearing on uniforms, newspaper mastheads, badges and on the movement's flags. The symbol completely replaced the fasces used from 1932 to 1935 with the adoption of the Flash and Circle. * The symbol of the Croatian Usta≈°e movement was capital letter U with the flaming grenade and the Croatian coat of arms. * A prominent symbol of the Greek 4th of August Regime was the Labrys/Pelekys, the double-headed axe which Ioannis Metaxas thought to be the oldest symbol of all Hellenic civilizations. * The symbol of Hungary's fascistic Arrow Cross Party was the Arrow Cross. * Austria's Fatherland's Front, that ruled the country from 1933 to 1938, used the crutch cross as its symbol. * The symbol of the Norwegian Nasjonal Samling was as golden/yellow sun cross on red background. * The symbol of Salazar's Portuguese Estado Novo regime was a stylized version of the Christ Cross and shield found on the national flag to distinguish its rivals in the Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista used the Order of Christ Cross. * The symbol of the Romanian Iron Guard was a triple cross (a variant of the triple parted and fretted) ‚Äì three parallel verticals intersected with three parallel horizontals, usually in black; it was meant to represent prison bars, as a badge of martyrdom. It was sometimes deemed the Archangel Michael Cross, after the patron saint of the movement. * The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) used the Wolfsangel as its main symbol. * The Brazilian Integralist Action used an upper case sigma (Œ£), to represent the summation of all things under the State. * The Russian Movement Against Illegal Immigration, which is often considered to be a moderate and legal neo-Nazi movement, uses the black-colored road sign \\"Stop Prohibited\\" (similar to the swastika) as their main symbol. *The quasi-Fascist Yugoslav ZBOR used a green shield with a blade of wheat on it, with a sword crossing the shield. *Iranian far-right groups used stylized lion and sun as their identity. Contemporary usage Celtic cross on a neo-Nazi flag Some neo-Nazi organizations continue to use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some neo-fascist groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke nationalistic sentiment but do not carry the same racist connotations. * Crosses: ** Celtic cross ‚Äì used by neo-Nazi white nationalist groups worldwide, the Italian New Force, Stormfront, David Duke's website and VSBD/PdA, a banned German neo-Nazi party ** Cross crosslet ‚Äì Lithuanian National Socialist Party ** Sun cross ‚Äì Nordic Reich Party, Sweden, Knights Party * Swastika or Hakenkreuz ‚Äì continues to be used by neo-Nazi groups such as the American Nazi Party, the S√£o Paulo Skinheads in Brazil, and was used by the National Socialist Front of Sweden ** Bladed swastika ‚Äì Russian National Unity * Wolfsangel symbol ** Used by the SS and Hitlerjugend as well as various neo-Nazi groups ** Azov Battalion, a paramilitary militia fighting against pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine Preparing for War With Ukraine‚Äôs Fascist Defenders of Freedom\\"Azov Battalion fighters parading with the Wolfsangel banner favoured by neo-Nazis\\"USA nie bƒôdƒÖ szkoliƒá batalionu AzowOne year on: where are the far-right forces of Ukraine?

He has been cited as an influence on various Japanese filmmakers from the 1970s onward. Life Terayama was born December 10, 1935, in Hirosaki, Aomori, the only son of Hachiro and Hatsu Terayama. His father died at the end of the Pacific War in Indonesia in September 1945. When Terayama was nine, his mother moved to Ky≈´sh≈´ to work at an American military base, while he himself went to live with relatives in the city of Misawa, also in Aomori. Terayama lived through the Aomori air raids that killed more than 30,000 people. Terayama entered Aomori High School in 1951 and, in 1954, he enrolled in Waseda University's Faculty of Education to study Japanese language and literature.

In 1967, Terayama formed the Tenj≈ç Sajiki theater troupe, whose name comes from the Japanese translation of the 1945 Marcel Carn√© film Les Enfants du Paradis and literally translates to \\"ceiling gallery\\" (with a meaning similar to the English term \\"peanut gallery\\"). The troupe was dedicated to the avant-garde and staged a number of controversial plays tackling social issues from an iconoclastic perspective in unconventional venues, such the streets of Tokyo or private homes. Some major plays include \\"Bluebeard\\" (), \\"Yes\\" (), and \\"The Crime of Fatso Oyama\\" (). Also involved with the theater were artists Aquirax Uno and Tadanori Yokoo, who designed many of the advertisement posters for the group. Musically, he worked closely with experimental composer J.A. Seazer and folk musician Kan Mikami. Playwright Rio Kishida was also part of the company. She viewed Terayama as a mentor, and together they collaborated on Shintokumaru (Poison Boy), The Audience Seats, and Lemmings. Terayama experimented with 'city plays', a fantastical satire of civic life. Shuji Terayama's grave (Takao Cemetery zone A front row, È´òÂ∞æÈúäÂúíAÂå∫) Google maps view Also in 1967, Terayama started an experimental cinema and gallery called 'Universal Gravitation,' which is still in existence at Misawa as a resource center. The Terayama Sh≈´ji Memorial Hall, which has a large collection of his plays, novels, poetry, photography and a great number of his personal effects and relics from his theatre productions, can also be found in Misawa. In 1976, he was a member of the jury at the 26th Berlin International Film Festival.  Legacy  Terayama published almost 200 literary works and over 20 short and full-length films. In 1997, the Shuji Terayama Museum was opened in Misawa, Aomori, with personal items donated by his mother, Hatsu. The museum was designed by visual artist Kiyoshi Awazu, who had previously collaborated with Terayama. As of 2015, the museum's director is poet Eimei Sasaki, who had previously starred in Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets (1968). Asahi Shimbun named an award after Terayama with the inauguration of their Asahi Performing Arts Awards in 2001. \\"The Terayama Sh≈´ji Prize is meant to recognize artistic innovation by individuals or organizations who have demonstrated artistic innovation\\". However, the awards were suspended in 2008. In March 2012, Tate Modern in London hosted a tribute to Terayama that was attended by Ky≈çko Kuj≈ç and Terayama's assistant director, Henrikku Morisaki.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 in length along its main stem, which is located in northwest Connecticut with major tributaries extending into southwest Massachusetts. Via its longest branch (the West Branch), the Farmington's length increases to , making it the Connecticut River's longest tributary by a mere over the major river directly to its north, the Westfield River. The Farmington River's watershed covers . Historically, the river played an important role in small-scale manufacturing in towns along its course, but it is now mainly used for recreation and drinking water.  Geography  Headwaters for both main branches of the Farmington River, referred to as the East Branch and West Branch, are found in southwestern Massachusetts, though only the West Branch officially begins north of the Connecticut border. The West Branch rises at the outlet of Hayden Pond in Otis, Massachusetts. The East Branch begins in Hartland, Connecticut at the confluence of Pond, Hubbard and Valley Brooks. However, this branch has been impounded along the first 11 miles of its course to form the Barkhamsted Reservoir and Lake McDonough; it does not assume a particularly river-like appearance until it exits Lake McDonough in New Hartford, Connecticut. The East Branch and West Branch join in New Hartford, Connecticut just about one mile south of Lake McDonough. Upper reaches of the river flow mostly southward, but the river turns northward in Farmington, Connecticut and then runs mostly north and east until it flows into the Connecticut River in Windsor, Connecticut.  History  The Farmington River was the home of a Native American indigenous people called the Massaco, who inhabited the Simsbury and Canton area of Connecticut. One of the eighteen bands of the Wappinger, they lived and fished along the river, which later acquired the name \\"Farmington\\" The Farmington River was one of the Massaco's chief fishing grounds.The land of the Massaco was subsequently purchased by the Dutch. This and its settlement during the era of the Connecticut Colony are described in the early history of Simsbury. The Spoonville Dam, built on the Farmington River in 1899 below the Tariffville Gorge in East Granby, was breached in the Flood of 1955 and remained as a partial dam for several decades before being removed in July 2012. The dam, as well as the bridge crossing the Farmington River downstream at Route 187, derived its name from the silver plating factory erected in 1840 on the north bank of the river. It was the first factory of its kind in the United States. = Historical crossings = Several old bridges constructed in the 19th century and early 20th century still span the Farmington River to this day. Among these are: * Farmington River Railroad Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Windsor, Connecticut built in 1867 * Drake Hill Road Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Simsbury, Connecticut constructed in 1892 and * Town Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Canton, Connecticut constructed by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company in 1895 * Richards Corner Bridge, a Pratt through-truss bridge in New Hartford, Connecticut built in 1930 which spans the East Branch Farmington River * Pleasant Valley Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Barkhamsted, Connecticut built in 1939 * Unionville Bridge, a Warren through-truss bridge in Farmington, Connecticut built in 1939  Recreation  There are several whitewater sections. One of these, the so-called \\"Upper Farmington\\" section of the West Branch in New Boston, Massachusetts, is about 7 miles (11 km) long. It is Class 2 through farm and woods scenery to an iron bridge, where kayak and canoe slalom races are held. Below the bridge the river becomes Class 3-4, with a short gorge with several abrupt drops. Tariffville Gorge DamThe biggest of these is about four feet at Decoration Rock. Below, the river continues fast and technical with many rocks and constant maneuvering required. The river is continuously rapid, leading through larger drops at Battering Ram rapid and Corkscrew. Eventually it flattens to Class 2 until a final, ledge rapid at Bear's Den, just above the reservoir. The Upper Farmington is barely runnable (very scratchy with many exposed rocks and pinning possibilities) during fall dam releases, and is a much better run at levels of about 600 cubic feet per second (16,990 l/s), or about 5 feet (1.5 m) on the internet gauge for that section. A second whitewater section is found in Tariffville, Connecticut, one mile (1.6 km) of technical Class 3 water which is runnable all year round. The river is normally paddled at levels between 1.5 and 2.75 feet (45‚Äì75 cm) on the internet gauge; above 2.5 feet (75 cm) it becomes significantly heavier and more dangerous. This section includes the famous T-ville Hole, where kayakers can practice hole surfing and freestyle moves above a flat pool. Below the Hole is a broken dam, where the river funnels through an abrupt four foot drop into a large wave. This area is popular with swimmers in summer, and it is risky due to heavy currents and undercut rocks. Satan's Kingdom offers tubing on the Farmington River.There have been at least three fatal drownings in the Tariffville Gorge section, primarily people who were not properly prepared or trained for the heavy rapids and pinning obstacles in the gorge. Paddlers without helmets, lifejackets and Class 3 whitewater skills should end downriver trips at Tariffville Park, just above the start of the gorge. Other whitewater areas include Satan's Kingdom in New Hartford, Connecticut, which is popular with tubers, and the Crystal Rapids section in Collinsville and Unionville, Connecticut, which is about four miles (6 km) of Class 1-3 training waters with a bicycle and pedestrian path on the right side of the river. Entrance to the park is free. A service will also pick tubers up and drop them off at certain points.  Dams and power generation  The west branch of the river includes two hydroelectric dams in West Hartland and Colebrook, run by the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut. Colebrook River Lake on the West Branch Farmington River.The largest dam on the east branch is the Saville Dam, which impounds the Barkhamsted Reservoir. The Rainbow Dam, a dam with a hydroelectric generator and a fish ladder, dams the river at Windsor, a few miles before the river flows into the Connecticut River. A number of other dams have been built on the river since European settlement, usually to power mills and other industry. A few, such as in Collinsville, are still mostly intact. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act (H.R. 316;113th Congress) would instruct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut to restart two small power dams along the river. The bill passed the United States House of Representatives on February 12, 2013, but has not yet become law. Water released from or flowing over the Otis Reservoir dam enters the Farmington River just north of Reservoir Road in Otis, Massachusetts. Significant quantities of water are released during the fall in order to drop the reservoir water level for the winter.  Natural resources and conservation  Much of the Farmington River has been designated as part of the United States National Wild & Scenic Rivers System. The first such designation on the river was bestowed in 1994 and included 14 miles of water, mostly along the Farmington River West Branch but also a section of the river's main stem, from Hartland to the New Hartford-Canton town line. In 2019, this designation was extended 1.1 miles further downstream to the confluence with the Nepaug River. Most of the Farmington River main stem and the Salmon Brook tributary system, totalling 61.7 miles of additional water, were also designated Wild & Scenic in 2019. The Farmington River Coordinating Committee oversees the implementation of management plans for the designated runs of the Farmington River and includes representatives from towns along the river, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Metropolitan District Commission, National Park Service, Farmington River Watershed Association and Farmington River Anglers Association. The Farmington River and its tributaries are known to contain 11 species of freshwater mussels. The Farmington has the highest mussel species diversity of any tributary to the Connecticut, lacking only the Yellow lampmussel, which is found only in the mainstem of the Connecticut from Turners Falls, MA downriver to Windsor, CT.

Mona Hatoum (; born 1952) is a Palestinian multimedia and installation artist who lives in London. Biography Mona Hatoum was born in 1952 in Beirut, Lebanon, to Palestinian parents. Although born in Lebanon, Hatoum was ineligible for a Lebanese identity card and does not identify as Lebanese. As she grew up, her family did not support her desire to pursue art. She continued to draw throughout her childhood, though, illustrating her work from poetry and science classes. Hatoum studied graphic design at Beirut University College in Lebanon for two years and then began working at an advertising agency. Hatoum was displeased with the advertising work she produced. During a visit to London in 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out and Hatoum was forced into exile. She stayed in London, training at both the Byam Shaw School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art (University College, London) between the years 1975 and 1981. In the years since, \\"she has traveled extensively and developed a dynamic art practice that explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity, and being an outsider.\\" Artwork and themes Hatoum explores a variety of different subject matter via different theoretical frameworks. Her work can be interpreted as a description of the body, as a commentary on politics, and on gender and difference as she explores the dangers and confines of the domestic world. Her work can also be interpreted through the concept of space as her sculpture and installation work depend on the viewer to inhabit the surrounding space to complete the effect. There are always multiple readings to her work. The physical responses that Hatoum desired in order to provoke psychological and emotional responses ensures unique and individual reactions from different viewers. =Early work= Hatoum's early work consisted largely of performance pieces that used a direct physical confrontation with an audience to make a political point. She used this technique as a means of making a direct statement using her own body; the performances often referenced her background and the political situation in Palestine. In her work, she addressed the vulnerability of the individual in relation to the violence inherent in institutional power structures. Her primary point of reference was the human body, sometimes using her own body. =Measures of Distance= Created in 1988, Measures of Distance illustrates Hatoum's early themes of family, displacement, and female sexuality. The video piece itself is fifteen minutes long and consists of intimate, colored photographs of Hatoum's mother showering. Hatoum overlays the photographs with letters that her mother, living in Beirut during the civil war, wrote to Hatoum, living in London. Handwritten in Arabic, the letters make up the video's narration and themes, and speak to the difficulty of sending letters in a time of conflict. Hatoum reads the letters aloud in Arabic and English. The video roots itself in the brief family reunion that occurred in Beirut between Hatoum and her parents in 1981. While primarily about the mother‚Äìdaughter relationship, in her mother's letters Hatoum's father is mentioned and thus the father‚Äìdaughter relationship as well as the husband‚Äìwife relationship is examined in this video. The elements of the video‚Äîthe letters, Hatoum's mother's wish to see her, and mentions of the war by Hatoum's mother‚Äîexplore how the war in Palestine and the war in Lebanon displaced the identity and the relationships of Hatoum and her family. The video is neither a documentary nor meant to be journalistic. The video critiques stereotypes and remains optimistic, since the narration from the letters is largely positive, except about the distance between the mother and the daughter. Hatoum attempts to recreate the moments when she reunited with her mother in Beirut and when she asked to photograph her in the shower. Instead of directly depicting the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict or the Lebanese Civil War, Hatoum shows how the conflicts affected her family's relationships and her identity. Hatoum both distances and draws in Western audiences through her narration in English and Arabic. In this portrait of a Palestinian woman, Hatoum gives her mother a voice while subverting stereotypes about Arab women. The Tate Modern describes the portrait in the following words: \\"It is through the daughter's art-making project that the mother is able to present herself freely, in a form which cements a bond of identity independent of colonial and patriarchal concerns.\\" Measures of Distance is one of the few works done by Hatoum that speaks directly to her background. In other works, Hatoum prefers to be more abstract and to leave the work open ended. While not as abstract as many of her other works, the viewer is still forced to work through how to understand the formal elements of the video. They are not easily given by Hatoum, as the narration is here. \\"The video transmits the 'paradoxical state of geographical distance and emotional closeness.'\\" Measures of Distance was screened at the London Film Festival, AFI National Video Festival, and the Montreal Women's Film and Video Festival. = Grater Divide = Made in 2002, Grater Divide transforms an everyday object, in this case a common kitchen grater, into a divider, alluding to political alienation, perhaps caused by Israeli-built walls in Palestinian territory. =Hot Spot III= Hot Spot III, created in 2009, is a large installation piece of the globe tilted like the Earth and about as tall as a person. The title connects to the theme of political unrest, imagining conflict in one geographical area upsetting the whole world. The globe is made of cage-like steel that glows luminescent red, as though the world is ablaze, flickering quickly, meant to create an energetic environment that mesmerizes the audience. The installation also invokes a feeling of danger with the hot red lighting outlining the continents. Hatoum challenges whether minimalist or surrealist forms can adequately address the world's issues. =Later work= In the late 1980s, Hatoum abandoned performances as politically too direct and instead turned her attention to installations and objects, taking up some of the earlier ideas from her student days at the Slade School of Art in London. From then on, she relied on the kind of interactivity that lets the spectator become involved in the aesthetic experience without making the artist as performer the focus of attention. Since the 1990s, her work has generally shifted from making statements to asking questions. Much more is required of the viewer as performances were replaced by sculptures and installations that required a level of mental and physical interactivity. Her practice has shifted towards site specificity in, for instance, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and Kunsthalle Hamburg. A notable piece exemplifying her turn from performance to physical objects is Keffieh (1993‚Äì1999), a scarf woven of human hair that juxtaposes ideas of femininity and religion. =The body= Many of Hatoum's early pieces situate the body as the locus of a network of concerns‚Äîpolitical, feminist, and linguistic‚Äîthereby eliciting a highly visceral response. One of her pieces, a 1994 video installation called Corps etranger, showed color video images of an endoscopic probe of her body. =Politics= The political possibilities for the uncanny visual motif are relevant to discussions of Hatoum's work, as the disruption achieved at a psychological level can have broad implications involving power, politics, or individual concerns. The allusiveness attained by her work is not always referencing grand political events, or appealing to a generalized cultural consciousness, but instead to a seemingly unattainable threat that is only possible to address on an individual scale. Hatoum has tied her works to other political movements, especially black struggle. In an interview with Michael Archer in 1997, Hatoum said: \\"At the beginning it was important to think about the black struggle as a total political struggle. There are common political forces and attitudes that discriminate against people. In the same way as feminism started off with this totalizing concept of 'sisterhood', and then we ended up with many feminisms, if you like. The black struggle became more diversified once the basic issues were established. And blackness here is not to do with the colour of your skin but a political stance.\\" Exhibitions Since 1983, Mona Hatoum has been displaying both her installations and her video performance art pieces in exhibitions around the world. She has been featured in individual exhibitions as recently as 2018 at White Cube in Hong Kong. Some of her other solo exhibitions of note include: Centre Pompidou, Paris (1994), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1997), The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (1998), Castello di Rivoli, Turin (1999), Tate Britain, London (2000), Hamburger Kunsthalle, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Magasin 3, Stockholm (2004) and Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2005), Parasol Unit, London (2008), Darat Al Funun, Jordan (2008), Fondazione Querini Stampalia, Venice (2009), Beirut Art Center (2010), and the Menil Collection (2017). She has also participated in a number of recognized group exhibitions, including: The Turner Prize (1995), Venice Biennale (1995 and 2005), Biennale of Sydney (2006) and the Biennale of Montreal; Drone the automated image (2013). A solo exhibition entitled Turbulence is organized in 2014 by Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha. Hatoum's work was featured in a solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2015. In May 2016, Tate Modern held a \\"comprehensive exploration into 35 years of Hatoum's work in Britain, from her early performance and video works to her sculpture and large-scale installation\\" The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas organized a solo exhibition titled \\"Mona Hatoum: Terra Infirma\\" that was on view from October 12, 2017 to February 25, 2018. This exhibition then traveled to the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and was on view from April 6 to August 11, 2018. In March 2018, Hatoum was shortlisted for the Hepworth Prize for Sculpture, alongside Michael Dean, Phillip Lai, Magali Reus and Cerith Wyn Evans. The work of the shortlisted artists was displayed at the Hepworth Wakefield gallery from the end of October of that year.

It was reissued in 1993 on CD with additional material compiled from cassette releases, international releases, and previously undistributed tracks. The cover art was designed by Steven R. Gilmore. Bites was certified gold by Music Canada on August 5, 1994. Background The first CD release of Bites was on the compilation Bites and Remission in 1987. This release replaced the songs \\"Assimilate\\" and \\"The Choke\\" with remixed versions and it did not include all of the tracks featured on the earlier cassette release, which was significantly longer. A similar but discrete CD called Remission & Bites was released by Play It Again Sam in Europe during the same year. On the 1993 reissue, the song \\"One Day\\" is not listed anywhere in the artwork or credits. The Tear Garden's self-titled EP from 1986 (one year after Bites originally saw release) includes a track called \\"The Center Bullet\\", a song that runs nearly ten minutes and that later appeared on the 1993 CD release of Bites as an instrumental titled \\"The Centre Bullet\\" (notice the slight spelling variation). The two songs are identical save for the presence of vocals by Edward Ka-Spel of The Legendary Pink Dots on The Tear Garden version. Late reissues of The Tear Garden album Tired Eyes Slowly Burning also feature that version of \\"The Center Bullet\\". Having both been made by cEvin Key and Dave Ogilvie, it is unclear whether the track was originally a creation of Skinny Puppy or of The Tear Garden. Critical reception Billboard magazine recommended Bites, calling it a \\"strong club collection a la Kraftwerk\\". Tom Harrison of The Province gave the album a favorable review, calling it \\"willfully ugly and menacing\\", and described its songs as \\"cleanly produced\\" and \\"carefully textured\\". Tim DiGravina of AllMusic was also receptive, calling the album a \\"fascinating look at Skinny Puppy in embryonic form\\", and described its sound as \\"delicate and pristine\\". DiGravina also noted the influence of groups such as Depeche Mode, Human League, and Cabaret Voltaire. Mike Abrams of the Ottawa Citizen thought Bites was depressing and for people with \\"undiscriminating tastes\\". He named the songs \\"Assimilate\\" and \\"Last Call\\" as the album's best tracks. James Muretich of the Calgary Herald was less impressed with Bites, calling the record \\"annoying\\" and likened the band to robots. In 1999, Chart magazine listed Bites among the most influential Canadian albums of the 80s. Track listing Samples *The song \\"Assimilate\\" contains a sample from the 1976 film Marathon Man ‚Äì \\"Is it safe?\\". *The song \\"Blood on the Wall\\" contains a sample from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) ‚Äì \\"You see?

Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie (BCh, Polish Farmers' Battalions) was a Polish World War II resistance movement, guerrilla and partisan organisation. The organisation was created in mid-1940 by the agrarian political party People's Party and by 1944 was partially integrated with the Armia Krajowa (Home Army). At its height, in summer 1944 the organisation had 160,000 members. History Initially after the occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union and Germany, the peasant parties were reluctant to forming their own armed resistance forces. Since mid-1940 several smaller groups were formed, mostly for self-defence of Polish peasants against German terror and economic policies. Most of members of peasant parties grouped into CKRL (Central Directorate of Peasant Movement) who received military training before the war were transferred to other armed resistance organizations, most notably to ZWZ. However, in early 1941 it was decided that an armed force be created. The core of the newly formed BCh came from the earlier organization Ch≈Çostra (an acronym of Ch≈Çopska Stra≈º - Farmers' Guard), as well as from other underground organizations of the farmers movement, such as ZwiƒÖzek M≈Çodzie≈ºy Wiejskiej (Association of Farming Youth), Ch≈Çopska Organizacja Wolno≈õci \\"Rac≈Çawice\\" (Farmers' Freedom Organization \\"Rac≈Çawice\\") and Centralny ZwiƒÖzek M≈Çodej Wsi \\"Siew\\" (Central Union of Village Youth \\"Sowing\\"). The structure of the BCh was based on pre-war administrative divisions of Poland. Areas were roughly correspondent to pre-war Voivodeships, and were further divided onto districts (based on powiats) and commune-based units. By mid-1943 10 areas were formed: :# Warsaw :# Warsaw Voivodeship :# Kielce :# Lublin :# ≈Å√≥d≈∫ :# Krak√≥w, Rzesz√≥w, Silesia :# Bia≈Çystok :# Volhynia :# Lw√≥w, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, Tarnopol :# Pozna≈Ñ Each of the areas fielded its own armed units. The units were basically of two types: # territorial militias - created for self-defense, sabotage and preparation of future all-national uprising # tactical units - strictly militarized, created for use as the core of the future all-national uprising The units of the latter type were later mostly joined with the Armia Krajowa. The commander of the BCh was Franciszek Kami≈Ñski, his chiefs of staff were Kazimierz Banach (until 1942) and S. Koter. During the process of unification of Polish underground, large part (approximately 50 000 men) of the BCh soldiers was integrated by the Government Delegate's Office at Home with Armia Krajowa and Pa≈Ñstwowy Korpus Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. Also, by early 1943 part of the tactical units were transformed into Special Units specialized in diversion and reprisal actions. An estimate for summer 1944 the Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie had approximately 160 000 members grouped in 70 units. However, the full unification with the Armia Krajowa did not occur until the end of the war. After the Red Army entered Poland, elements of BCh started to cooperate with the communist-backed Armia Ludowa, while the majority remained loyal to the Polish government. However, the incoming end of the war, as well as information of the Yalta Conference made further resistance futile and on 2 April 1945 most of the Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie units came out from the underground. Some of the soldiers were arrested by the communists, while others joined the reestablished People's Party of Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. Formally the Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie were dissolved in September 1945. Tasks and actions The main tasks of Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie were: :# Defense of the peasants against German economic exploitation :# Defense of peasants against expulsions :# Self-defense against German terror :# Aid to the expelled, Jews, the intelligentsia, and to the families of those enslaved by the Germans. The first major actions of armed resistance began in late 1942 when the Zamo≈õƒá area, due to its fertile black soil, was chosen for German colonization as part of Generalplan Ost. Polish farmers were expropriated and forcibly expelled from the farms with great brutality. Their farms were handed over to German settlers. Children were separated from their parents and after racial scrutiny sent over to Germany to be raised in German families. After several major battles against German units (the most notable being the battles of Wojda, R√≥≈ºa and Zaboreczno), the Germans had to halt the expulsions and in the end very few German settlers were brought to the area (see Zamo≈õƒá Uprising). Other major actions included liberation of prisoners from prisons in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w and Krasnystaw as well as the sinking of German river patrol ship Tannenberg on the Vistula.Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie Janusz Gmitruk, Piotr Matusak, Witold Wojdy≈Ço Wydawn.

It was adopted in 2020 after a city-wide contest to replace a previous flag. 1963 design Former Salt Lake City flag, used from 1969 to 2006. The first adopted city flag was designed in 1963 by J. Rulon Hales, the winner of a contest run by the Deseret News. The first version of the flag was made by art students from Highland High School and officially adopted for use on November 13, 1969. It included seagulls, pioneers, a covered wagon, and the sun rising over the Wasatch Mountains in the middle of a white background. The center was in the general shape of a beehive, which is a symbol of industry and relates to the founding of Salt Lake City and its Mormon heritage. 2006 design Flag used from 2006 to 2020. The second design of the flag was approved on October 4, 2006, by the Salt Lake City Council. Rocky Anderson, the mayor of Salt Lake City at the time, had sponsored a contest in 2004 to redesign the flag. Anderson argued that the \\"old flag was too exclusive and focused entirely on the city's Mormon heritage.\\" The contest, which received more than 50 entries, did not produce any designs that the city council felt had the \\"symbolic visuals that could be associated with Salt Lake City\\". They then formed a subcommittee to work with the mayor's office to create new designs for the flag. The final design was approved with a 4‚Äì2 margin. 2020 design In May 2020, the city government opened a two-month contest to redesign the flag with a $3,000 prize for the winning entry. The city received over 600 design entries, of which eight finalists were selected in July by the Flag Design Review Committee for public review. The winning design, announced in September 2020, was created through the merger of two finalists created by a pair of students from West High School. The design features a sego lily, the Utah state flower, in the canton amidst horizontal fields of blue and white. It was sent to the city council for consideration with the endorsement of mayor Erin Mendenhall and adopted on October 6, 2020.

The Islands of Race Rocks are located just off the southern tip of Vancouver Island, about southwest of Victoria, British Columbia. History The lighthouse was built between 1859-1860 by the crew of HMS Topaze and outside labourers under a contract awarded to John Morris by the British Government.First contact with Easter Island It was illuminated on 26 December 1860, six weeks after the smaller Fisgard Island lighthouse built at the entrance to Esquimalt Harbour near Victoria. In 2010, both lighthouses celebrated their sesquicentennial. See A complete history of the Light Station and Ecological Reserve. It has a 24.4 m (80 feet) cylindrical tower with black and white bands, and flashes a white light every 10 seconds. Its foghorn sounds three blasts at one-minute intervals. The lighthouse has been automated since 1997 at which time Lester B. Pearson College took over the management of the station and the surrounding Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. Restoration of the interior and exterior of the historic light tower was carried out in 2009.

Early life and education Sylvanus Thayer (9 June 1785-7 Sept. 1872) was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, the son of Nathaniel Thayer, a gentleman farmer, and his wife Dorcas Faxon.Herman Hattaway, Michael D. Smith. \\"Thayer, Sylvanus\\"; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000, accessed ; American Council of Learned Societies. Published by Oxford University Press. In 1793, at the age of 8, Thayer was sent to live with his uncle Azariah Faxon and attend school in Washington, New Hampshire. There he met General Benjamin Pierce, who, like Faxon, was a veteran of the Revolutionary War. In 1803 Thayer matriculated at Dartmouth College, graduating in 1807 as valedictorian of his class. However, he never gave the valedictory address at Dartmouth, having been granted an appointment to West Point by President Thomas Jefferson at the behest of General Pierce. Thayer graduated from the United States Military Academy after a single year and received his commission as a second lieutenant in 1808. His first assignment was to supervise the construction of Fort Warren (later renamed Fort Winthrop) in Boston Harbor, foreshadowing the bulk of his later career.Fort Winthrop at FortWiki.com During the War of 1812, Thayer directed the fortification and defense of Norfolk, Virginia, and was promoted to major. In 1815, he was provided $5,000 to travel to Europe, where he studied for two years at the French √âcole Polytechnique. While traveling in Europe he amassed a collection of science and especially mathematics texts that now form a valuable collection for historians of mathematics. Superintendent of West Point In 1817, President James Monroe ordered Thayer to West Point to become superintendent of the Military Academy following the resignation of Captain Alden Partridge. Under his stewardship, the Academy became the nation's first college of engineering. While at West Point Thayer established numerous traditions and policies which are still in use at West Point. These include the values of honor and responsibility, strict mental and physical discipline, the demerit system, summer encampment, high academic standards and the requirement that cadets maintain outstanding military bearing and appearance at all times. One of Thayer's reforms was to establish a standard four year curriculum with the cadets organized into four classes. Starting with the Class of 1823, July 1st was the date each year when the graduating class was commissioned and the entering class was sworn in. The graduation date was moved up to June 15 starting in 1861. Many of the cadets who attended West Point during Thayer's tenure, held key leadership positions during the Mexican War and American Civil War. Statue and Memorial to Sylvanus Thayer Later career Colonel Thayer's time at West Point ended with his resignation in 1833, after a disagreement with President Andrew Jackson. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. Thayer returned to duty with the Army Corps of Engineers. Thayer spent the great majority of the next 30 years as the chief engineer for the Boston area. During this time he oversaw the construction of both Fort Warren and Fort Independence to defend Boston Harbor. Thayer's great engineering ability can be observed in both of the above-mentioned forts. Thayer was a member of the Board of Engineers for Coast Defenses, April 2, 1833 to December 21, 1857, and was President of the Board from Dec. 7, 1838. He temporarily commanded of the Corps of Engineers from December 21, 1857 to December 22, 1858, while its commander, Colonel Joseph G. Totten, was on a leave of absence. In December 1858 Thayer was placed on an extended sick leave of absence. He did not play an active role in the American Civil War. In August 1861, Fort Thayer, an earthwork fort part of the Civil War Defenses of Washington, DC, was built and named in his honor.1862 Commission to Study the Defenses Report - Letter to the Secretary of War - Washington, December 24, 1862 - http://www.npshistory.com/publications/cwdw/hrs/appc.htm Thayer retired from the Army on June 1, 1863 with the rank of colonel in the Corps of Engineers. He was retired under the first act regulating the retirement of Army officers which required the retirement of any officer with more than 45 years of service. Death and legacy As a result of Thayer's enduring legacy at the United States Military Academy, in 1869 a meeting took place in Braintree between Thayer and the West Point graduate and Civil War hero Brigadier General Robert Anderson. An outcome of Anderson's 1869 meeting with Thayer was the establishment of the Military Academy's Association of Graduates (AoG). In 1867, Thayer donated $40,000 to the trustees of Dartmouth College to create the Thayer School of Engineering. Thayer personally located and recommended USMA graduate Lieutenant Robert Fletcher to Dartmouth president Asa Dodge Smith. Fletcher became the school's first‚Äîthen only‚Äîprofessor and dean. The Thayer School admitted its first three students to a graduate program in 1871. Also in 1871 at the bequest of his will Thayer Academy in Braintree, Massachusetts was conceived. It opened September 12, 1877. Thayer died on September 7, 1872 at his home in Braintree. He was reinterred at West Point Cemetery in 1877. Thayer's obituary appeared in the New York Times on September 8, 1872. Works Thayer's papers and manuscripts are divided between the U.S. Military Academy Library, West Point, New York, and the Dartmouth College Library, Hanover, New Hampshire. Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions In 1852 herpetologists Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard of the Smithsonian Institution named a species of lizard in honor of Thayer, Sceloporus thayeri, which was later placed in the synonymy of Sceloporus undulatus hyacinthinus.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Thayer\\", p. 264). On April 21, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Thayer for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from May 31, 1863, the day before he retired,Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, p. 737.

The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on April 27, 1864. To honor his achievements, in 1958, the Sylvanus Thayer Award was created by the United States Military Academy. He has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a 9¬¢ Great Americans series postage stamp. Thayer Street, in the Inwood, Manhattan section of New York City, is named after him.http://myinwood.net/inwood-street-names/ The house where Thayer was born in Braintree, Massachusetts is preserved and open to the public.

Willistead Manor was designed by renowned architect Albert Kahn in the 16th-century Tudor-Jacobean style of an English manor house. It was built in 1904-1906, and was commissioned by Edward Chandler Walker, the second son of Hiram Walker. It is named after the first son, Willis Walker, a lawyer in Detroit, MI, who died young. Contrary to popular belief, Hiram Walker never lived in the home. Edward and his wife never had any children. After Edward passed on in 1915, Mrs. Walker did not care to keep living in the big home alone, and she deeded the house and grounds to the town of Walkerville. When Walkerville was amalgamated with Windsor in 1935, it obtained ownership of Willistead. In the years after its use as a residence, Willistead served as the Walkerville Town Hall, Art Gallery of Windsor and as a public library branch. In the late 1970s early 1980s the City of Windsor, afraid of the repairs and upkeep on the mansion, wanted to demolish the structure. Preservationists stepped in and the home was saved. Today the 36-room mansion is used as a banquet hall, and the three-acre (12,000 m¬≤) grounds are incorporated in a larger public park. The house can be rented for occasions such as weddings, corporate meeting and private parties. The house is also decorated for the Christmas holiday.

Vegetable juice is often mixed with fruits such as apples or grapes to improve flavor. It is often touted as a low-sugar alternative to fruit juice, although some commercial brands of vegetable juices use fruit juices as sweeteners, and may contain large amounts of sodium.  Home-made juice  Making vegetable juice at home is an alternative to buying commercial juices, and may augment diets low in vegetables and fruits. The juicer separates juice from pulp fibers. Masticating juicers employ a slow-geared grinding mechanism. A cheaper and faster alternative uses centrifugal force to achieve separation. The slower speed of the masticating process is held to protect the vegetables from oxidation and heat (from friction), reducing nutrient breakdown. Advocates of masticating juicers often cite the preservation of enzymes, though these are rarely specified and the claims are unsubstantiated by a body of academic support. Juicing the fine leaves of wheatgrass usually requires a masticating process.  Varieties  Carrot juice and carrots Commercial vegetable juices are commonly made from varying combinations of carrots, beets, pumpkin, and tomatoes. The latter two, although not technically vegetables, are commonly used to increase palatability. Other popular items in vegetable juices are parsley, dandelion greens, kale, celery, fennel, and cucumbers. Lemon, garlic and ginger may be added by some for medicinal purposes. Other common juices include carrot juice, tomato juice, and turnip juice. In Asian cultures, primarily Chinese, Chinese yam (Chinese: shƒÅn y√†o, Japanese: nagaimo) is also used for vegetable juices. They are used quite sparingly, however, for many Chinese consider it to be a medicine rather than a vegetable. Kale juice marketed as Aojiru in Japan has become well known for its purported health benefits and bitter taste. Japan also markets several kinds of vegetable juices which, unlike Western juices, usually depend on carrots and fruits instead of large amounts of tomato juice for their flavor. Nutrition In general, vegetable juices are recommended as supplements to whole vegetables, rather than as a replacement. However, the actual nutritional value of juices versus whole vegetables is still contested. USDA guidelines for Americans states that 3/4 cup of 100% vegetable juice is equivalent to one serving of vegetables.5 A Day Fruit and Vegetable Quick Tips This is upheld by a 2006 study, which found that juices provide similar health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer although the authors noted \\"a lack of human data and contradictory findings hampered conclusions\\". Another study has found that drinking vegetable juice reduces risks of Alzheimer's Disease by 76%. However, the British Nutrition Foundation holds that although vegetable juice counts as a serving, it can only count as one serving, regardless of the amount of juice drunk. Additionally, A 2007 Japanese study showed that although Japanese commercial juices had nutritional benefits, they were insufficient as a primary mode of vegetable consumption. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetables such as beets also contain large amounts of sugar, so care must be taken when adding these to juices. Consumption of certain vegetable juices can also contribute substantially to oxalate intake; people who form calcium oxalate stones may be advised to limit consumption of vegetable juices. Cases of oxalate nephropathy associated with oxalate-rich juice intake have also been documented in susceptible individuals. Although the actual nutritional benefits of vegetable juice are contested, a 2008 UC Davis study found that drinking vegetable juice daily significantly increased drinkers' chances of meeting the daily recommended number of vegetable servings. Having an easy source of vegetables encouraged drinkers to incorporate more vegetables into their diets. Children who refuse whole vegetables may find vegetable juice, when blended with fruit juice, a palatable alternative.

She was retired in 1986. Career (US) Originally Blanquillo, the vessel was renamed on 24 September 1942 after the caiman, a fresh water alligator inhabiting the Amazon River, and launched on 30 March 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. R. C. Bonjour; commissioned 17 July 1944, Commander J. B. Azer in command. She reported to the Pacific Fleet. During World War II, Caiman sailed from Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 13 November 1944. Pausing at Saipan to put ashore her severely ill commanding officer and embark his relief, the submarine pushed on to the South China Sea, where she combined offensive patrol with lifeguard duty as a part of air-sea rescue operations to save aviators downed in air strikes on enemy-held territory. Aggressive American submarine and naval air attack had already greatly reduced the Japanese merchant fleet; hence Caiman made no contacts on this patrol, from which she returned to Fremantle, Australia, on 22 January 1945 to refit. Her second patrol, performed in the South China Sea and off the Gulf of Siam, from 18 February to 6 April, also yielded no contacts, but on her third, which began at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 28 April, she sank two small schooners. Their use illustrated graphically the almost complete loss of modern merchant ships which the Japanese had suffered largely at the hands of the U.S. Navy. Returning to Fremantle 27 June from her patrol area off southern Indo-China and western Borneo, the submarine refitted for her fourth war patrol, during which she performed three dangerous special missions, landing and later evacuating agents from the coast of Java. On this patrol, which took place from 22 July to the end of hostilities, she sank another Japanese schooner. She returned to Subic Bay 19 August, then sailed for the West Coast. Post- World War II, Caiman operated out of San Diego, Guam, and Pearl Harbor in 1946. In 1947 she made an Arctic familiarization cruise out of Seattle as part of Operation Blue Nose. Thereafter, based on Seattle, she served as reserve training ship until 23 April 1951, when she began a GUPPY conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Since then based at Pearl Harbor and San Diego, Caiman has alternated local operations and fleet exercises with tours of duty in the Far East at 18-month intervals. On her 1957 cruise, Brisbane, Australia, was added to her more usual itinerary of Japanese and Philippine ports. Career (Turkey) Caiman was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Register, and transferred to Turkey on 30 June 1972 under the terms of the Security Assistance Program. She arrived on 23 August 1972 to the Naval Yards in G√∂lc√ºk and was commissioned the following day as the third TCG Dumlupƒ±nar (S-339) - an important name in Turkish history, and the name of the final and defining battle of the Turkish War of Independence. Four years after Turkey took over ex-Caiman, she suffered a collision with Soviet freighter Szik Vovilov in the Dardanelles on 31 August 1976. Luckily, her crew was able to ground the submarine on a nearby bank, thus preventing the tragedy that befell the previous TCG Dumlupinar in 1953, the crash site of which lay just away. TCG Dumlupinar was subsequently salvaged, repaired, and continued to serve in the Turkish Navy for 11 years before she was decommissioned, and renamed Ceryan Botu (Y-1247) on 6 February 1983, under which name she served as a charging boat at G√∂lc√ºk Navy Yards until she was permanently retired on 15 September 1986. Honors and awards Of Caimans four war patrols, the last was designated \\"successful\\".

Early service Educated at Bedford School, MacMichael graduated with a first from Magdalene College, Cambridge.MacMICHAEL, Sir Harold (Alfred) : Who's Who After passing his civil service exam, he entered the Sudan Political Service in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He then served in the Blue Nile province until 1915 when he became a senior inspector of Khartoum province, rising to the position of civil secretary in 1926. In 1933 he became Governor of Tanganyika until 1937. The next year he became High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine and was blamed for sending at least 768 Jewish refugees aboard MV Struma to their deaths. Seven unsuccessful attempts, mainly by Lehi, were undertaken to assassinate him during his sojourn in Palestine. In the last, both he and his wife narrowly escaped death in an ambush Lehi mounted on 8 August 1944 on the eve of his replacement as High Commissioner. High Commissioner Harold MacMichael with Palestinian Mayors 1942: from left - Israel Rokach (Tel Aviv), Mustafa al-Khalidi (Jerusalem), MacMichael, Omar Effendi al Bitar (Jaffa), Shabtai Levy (Haifa) MacMichael also served a stint as High Commissioner of Malta. Malayan Union The British Military Administration set to task of reviving pre-war plans for centralised control over the Malay states within days after British Allied forces landed in Singapore on 5 September 1945. MacMichael, who had then completed his stint as High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine was empowered to sign official treaties with the Malay rulers over the Malayan Union proposal scheme. MacMichael made several visits to the Malay rulers, beginning with Sultan Ibrahim of Johor in October 1945. The Sultan quickly consented to MacMichael's proposal scheme, which was motivated by his strong desire to visit England at the end of the year. MacMichael paid further visits to other Malay rulers over the proposal, and sought their consent over the proposal scheme. Many Malay rulers expressed strong reluctance in signing the treaties with MacMichael, partly because they feared losing their royal status and the prospect of their states falling into Thai political influence.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 133-4 It has to be mentioned that the Sultans signed under duress. The British were intent on securing their agreement, and were willing to depose of any disagreeing Sultan, if necessary. The all of the Malay Sultans signed with so little resistance can be attributed to a rather simple ploy by the British. In a non public manner, privately told that should they resist, an inquiry would be held into their relations,conduct, or collaboration with the Japanese Occupation during the war. The sitting rulers, many concerned that both their offices and social positions would be destroyed, quickly complied. Later,their positions confirmed and secure,many would complain that the Malay Rulers were not given the opportunity to consult with their state councils nor with each other In the words of the Sultan of Kedah, \\"...I was presented with a verbal ultimatum and a time limit, and in the event of my refusing to sign the new agreement, ..a successor who would sign would be appointed.\\" The treaties provided that United Kingdom had full administrative powers over the Malay states except in areas pertaining to Islamic customs. The Malays strongly protested against the treaties, as the treaties had the effect of circumscribing the spiritual and moral authority of the Malay rulers, which the Malays held high esteem over it. Communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese were high, and the prospect of granting citizenship to non-Malays was deemed unacceptable to the Malays. Opposition to Malayan Union and MacMichael's perceived highhanded ways in getting the Malay rulers consent led to the birth of Malay nationalism in then British Malaya Family MacMichael's daughter, Araminta, married the politician and business leader Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington. His daughter Priscilla married James Raynes, a US Naval officer.

Design and development The Shvetsov M-11 was designed under a 1923 competition in the Soviet Union for a new engine to power trainer aircraft. It is a single-row five-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine with aluminum cylinder heads. Like the American Kinner B-5 5-cylinder radial of similar size, the M-11 had individual camshafts for each cylinder, operating the pushrods, rather than a single central cam ring. The initial versions of the M-11 suffered from a short service life of only 50 hours. The basic M-11 engine had a power output of 100 hp (73 kW), the newer M-11D variant was higher at 125 hp (92 kW). The ultimate version, M-11FR, introduced in 1946, increased power output to 160 hp at 1,900 rpm on takeoff and 140 hp at cruise and had provisions for a variable-pitch propeller, accessory drive (for vacuum pumps, compressors, generators, etc.) and featured a floatless carburetor.

Club career Before joining MLS and the Chicago Fire in late in 2004, Herron played two years with Costa Rican Herediano, which he led to Costa Rica's 2004's title, by leading the Costa Rican clausura's tournament with 14 goals and 13 assists. He had joined Herediano after he left Santos de Gu√°piles in December 2002.Herron con los florenses - Naci√≥n Herron had his best season for Chicago in 2006, when the 2006 Budweiser/Fire Golden Boot winner proved his productivity for the \\"Men in Red\\" by scoring eight goals in 20 games, with 18 starts. Herron put the team on his shoulders in the team's 2006 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup championship run, scoring four goals and one assist through the competition. His assist and game-winning goal against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Final at Toyota Park helped the Fire clinch an MLS club-record fourth title to the trophy case. After two and a half seasons in Chicago, he decided to get back to Club Sport Herediano on a loan from Chicago, but soon after that was sent to Columbus for the second pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft (which turned out to be Bakary Soumare) and forward Ryan Coiner. In the MLS Reserve Division he started and played one game for the Crew Reserves, notching one goal in 79 minutes of play. In February 2008, Herron left PuntarenasDelantero de Puntarenas F. C.

According to the MLS Soccer Disciplinary Committee, Herron was disciplined for making \\"unacceptable physical contact\\" with the referee Terry Vaughn and assistant referee George Gansner, conduct that led to him being sent off in stoppage time. Adding to the severity of his punishment was the fact that Herron returned to the field after the game. On April 19, 2007, Herron again was involved in a controversial incident during a game against the Revolution. He elbowed New England's Jay Heaps early in a nationally televised game on MLS Primetime Thursday. Herron did not receive a penalty card, because neither the referee, nor a linesman, saw the action. ESPN commentator Eric Wynalda called the foul, \\"the worst I've seen in a long time.\\" Herron was suspended for four games and fined $6,000. According to Herron, the elbow was in response to Jay Heaps grabbing his \\"private area\\" as well as xenophobic and racist comments. International career Herron made his debut for Costa Rica in a November 2002 friendly match against Ecuador, also recording his first international goal, and earned a total of 25 caps, scoring 7 goals.

Military career Educated at Repton School, Wauchope was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1893. He transferred to the 2nd Battalion Black Watch in January 1896. He served in the Second Boer War in South Africa from 1899, and took part in operations in Cape Colony, south of Orange River. British forces advancing north from the Cape to relieve the town of Kimberley, which was sieged by Boer forces, met heavy resistance in the Battle of Magersfontein on 11 December 1899. Wauchope was severely wounded in the battle, and was later mentioned in despatches and appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services. In April 1902 he was seconded for a Staff appointment, as an extra Aide de camp to Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Cape Colony. He served in World War I as Commanding Officer of 2 Bn Black Watch in France and Mesopotamia. After the War he joined 2nd Silesian Brigade, part of the British Upper Silesian Force, in Germany. He became Military Member of an Overseas Delegation to Australia and New Zealand in 1923 and then Chief of the British Section of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control for Berlin in 1924. He was appointed General Officer Commanding 44th (Home Counties) Division in 1927 and GOC Northern Ireland District in 1929. His last appointment was as High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief for Palestine and Trans-Jordan in 1931. Wauchope's administration was generally sympathetic to Zionist aspirations. By 1941 the former chief immigration officer for the Mandate, Albert Montefiore Hyamson, could write in his book Palestine: A Policy that \\"the first four years of his [Wauchope's] term were the heyday of Zionist history in Palestine.\\" Not only did immigration go up threefold (the Jewish population increased from 174,606 to 329,358), but Jews also increased their land holdings (in 1931 they increased their land holdings by 18,585 dunams or 4,646 acres, while in 1935 they increased them by 72,905), and finally Jewish business and commerce enjoyed an economic boom.Hyamson, Albert Montefiore. Palestine: A Policy Methuen, 1942, p. 147 He also promoted public works and civil engineering schemes but was regarded as lax at the early stages of the Arab rebellion. He retired in 1938.

It is employed to prepare specimens of animal or vegetable tissues for microscopic study. It provides excellent fixation of nuclear chromatin, connective tissue fibers and some cytoplasmic features but does not preserve delicate cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Helly's fixative is preferable for traditional dye staining of mitochondria. Zenker's fixative contains mercuric chloride (\\"corrosive sublimate\\"), potassium dichromate, sodium sulfate, water, and acetic acid. Fixatives containing mercuric chloride or potassium dichromate are toxic, making disposal as hazardous waste costly. Mercuric chloride can be replaced with the same weight of less toxic zinc chloride but the resulting \\"zinc-Zenker\\" may not give the same quality of fixation as the original mixture. This fixative is named after Konrad Zenker, a German histologist, who died in 1894 (Baker 1958). Stock solution Zenker is usually made with 50g of mercuric chloride, 25g of potassium dichromate, 10g of sodium sulfate (decahydrate) and distilled water to complete 1000 ml. Before use, 5 ml glacial acetic acid is added to 100 ml of the solution. Both the stock solution and the complete Zenker fixative are stable for many years. =Helly's fixative= If the glacial acetic acid is replaced by 5 ml of formalin (37‚Äì40% formaldehyde), the resulting solution is Helly's fixative, also sometimes called \\"formol-Zenker\\". Helly is stable for only a few hours because the formaldehyde and dichromate components react, producing formic acid and chromium(III) ions; the orange solution becomes greenish.

It was acquired by TE Connectivity (Tyco Electronics) in December 2010 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. It vacated its Eden Prairie location in May 2011 and moved staff and resources to other locations. ADC products were sold by CommScope after it acquired the Broadband Network Solutions business unit (including ADC) from TE Connectivity in August 2015. History In 1935, fellow engineers Ralph Allison and Walter Lehnert were each operating business efforts out of their respective basements; Ralph Allison was building audio amplifiers and Walter Lehnert was building transformers. In the fall of 1936, the two combined their efforts to form the Audio Development Company (ADC).Letter from Walter Lehnert to Fred Chapman (Sept. 18, 1950). The company was later renamed to ADC Telecommunications, Inc. During their first year in business, ADC built hearing aids and audiometers‚Äîa machine used for evaluating hearing acuity. Initially the audiometers were built for Maico, but in 1945 ADC began building audiometers under its own name. Additionally, by 1942, the company had designed a sophisticated audio system for the University of Minnesota, and the resulting jacks, plugs, patch cords and jackfields became the cornerstones for ADC's later entry into telecommunications. In 1949, ADC sold its audiometer product line and Ralph Allison left the company to form a new business in California. With Walter Lehnert remaining as president of the company, ADC diversified and focused its efforts in the area of transformers and filters for power lines, military electronics, telephone jacks and plugs.W.E. Lehnert to Address Section December 12th, SCOPE Radio Engineers (Dec. 1950). In 1961, ADC merged with Magnetic Controls Company, a manufacturer of power supplies and magnetic amplifiers with strong ties to the U.S. space program. The resulting company, ADC Magnetic Controls, had a decade of mixed success. Although transformer sales boomed during the 1960s, other new product initiatives failed to materialize. Perhaps the most significant product innovation during this period was the bantam jack, a miniaturized component that eventually became the standard for telephone circuit access and patching. Building on its growing sales of jacks and plugs in the early 1970s, ADC introduced prewired, connectorized jackfields, wired assemblies and test equipment for telephone operating companies. By 1974 the company was on solid ground, and by 1976, ADC had become the largest independent supplier of test boards in the United States. Former ADC headquarters complex in Eden Prairie, MN, USA. Now occupied by Optum Health ADC grew in 1983, when AT&T; was ordered to deregulate by the federal government. By establishing the seven Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) carriers as independent entities, the U.S. market for telecommunications expanded by 90 percent. ADC became a supplier for the RBOCs. ADC embarked on some acquisitions in the early 1990s, attempting to move \\"up the stack\\" in the datacom field by acquiring companies that manufactured datacom equipment. However, their ability to find synergies between these companies proved limited and eventually ADC was forced to move away from a hardware-only strategy, broadening out into software. This effort resulted in limited success as well, and happening about the same time as the dot-com bubble burst, caused ADC stock to plummet. Despite these ups and downs, ADC continued to survive and on July 13, 2010, the company released this announcement: \\"Tyco Electronics (NYSE: TEL) and ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) announced today a definitive agreement under which Tyco Electronics will acquire ADC for $12.75 per share in cash, or an enterprise value of approximately $1.25 billion. The transaction is expected to be accretive by approximately $0.14 per share in the first full year after closing excluding acquisition-related costs. It will position Tyco Electronics' Network Solutions segment as a leading global provider of broadband connectivity products to carrier and enterprise networks around the world.\\" The acquisition of ADC by TE Connectivity was completed on December 9, 2010 On January 28, 2015, it was publicly announced that the boards of directors of both TE Connectivity and CommScope agreed for CommScope to purchase the Broadband Network Solutions business unit of TE Connectivity in an all-cash deal for US$3.0 billion. The former ADC is a part of this business unit. The purchase of the Broadband Network Solutions business was closed on Aug 31. 2015 Corporate acquisitions In 1993, ADC acquired Fibermux Corp., a manufacturer of LAN Hubs and Data Multiplexers, later merging the Fibermux division with the Kentrox subsidiary. ADC sold Kentrox to the private equity firm Platinum Equity, LLC in 2001. ADC also acquired American Lightwave Systems, a manufacturer of uncompressed video transport equipment for telecom carriers. This division was later sold to C-COR Electronics. In 1996, ADCT merged with ITS (Information Transmission Systems) but has since sold it off. In 1999 ADC acquired Saville later sold to Intec Telecom Systems. In FY2005, ADC acquired Fiber Optic Network Solutions (FONS) to expand its FTTX offerings and OpenCell to enhance its wireless coverage and capacity offerings. In 2007 ADC acquired LGC Wireless to expand its portfolio of wireless coverage and capacity products and services. In 2008, ADC expanded its market presence and manufacturing capacity in China with the acquisition of Century Man Communications. May 1, 1997 - ADC Telecommunications Inc., Minneapolis, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Apex Group Inc., Columbia, MD, in a stock-for-stock purchase worth approximately $26 million. The Apex Group is a software development and information management company.

In 1928, he became High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine, where he was perceived as being cool to Zionism and the Jewish people. Though he admired some Zionist leaders, in particular Pinchas Rutenberg, in general Chancellor's attitude towards Jews was negative. He wrote to his son that \\"truly the Jews are an ungrateful race\\". His attitude towards Arabs was politically supportive but paternalistic; he wrote to his son \\"they are like children, and very difficult to help\\". While he was in London in 1929, Arab riots protesting Jewish immigration broke out. On his return, he initially condemned Arab attacks but was subsequently less critical. He helped write the Lord Passfield's White Paper of 1930, which aimed to reinterpret the Balfour Declaration in order to back away from a commitment to the creation of a Jewish state. He left Palestine in 1931. In 1931, Jerusalem's Straus Street was renamed Chancellor Avenue in his honour. The street reverted to its original name after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In 1937 he was appointed chairman of the Livestock Commission, which was set up following the passing of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937. In the 1947 King's Birthday Honours he was created a Knight Grand Cross in the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for services to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.

Early life Alden Partridge was born and raised on a family farm in Norwich, Vermont, the son of Elizabeth (Wright) Partridge and soldier Samuel Partridge Jr., who had fought in the American Revolutionary War, including the Battles of Saratoga. Tall and hardy, the younger Partridge hiked the Green and White Mountains,Stier, Maggie and McAdow, Ron, Into the Mountains: Stories of New England's Most Celebrated Peaks worked on his father's farm, and matriculated in local district schools. He attended Dartmouth College from 1802 to 1805. Military career Upon his graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1806, Partridge received the rank of lieutenant of engineers and an appointment at the academy as an assistant professor of mathematics. In its early days, the post served both as the academy for training prospective officers and the headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the superintendent was also chief of engineers. In 1808 chief engineer Jonathan Williams promoted Partridge to professor of mathematics and delegated to him the responsibilities of acting superintendent.Barnard, Alden Partridge, p. 51 Partridge set an example for physical fitness during his administration, frequently leading the cadet corps on extended marches in New York and neighboring states. Never profane or intemperate, superintendent Partridge required cadets to attend church services, occasionally preparing and delivering the sermon on Sundays.Guidotti, John A., The Legacy of Alden Partridge, p. 8 Named professor of engineers in 1813, and officially appointed as superintendent in 1814, \\"Old Pewt\\" developed a reputation among academy faculty as a martinet, often micromanaging subordinates, and occasionally demonstrating preference toward favorite cadets. The \\"Long Gray Line\\" tradition at West Point originated during Partridge's tenure when he had gray uniforms made in New York City in 1814 because of a shortage of blue cloth. In 1816, when the War Department decided to select a new Cadet uniform, gray was chosen because \\"it better suits the finance of the Cadets than one of blue.\\" In other words, gray uniforms were cheaper.U.S.M.A. Corps of Cadets, The Military Images, Sep/Oct 2000 by McAfee, Michael J\\"Cadets, U.S. Military Academy, 1816-1817,\\" Military Uniforms in America, Vol II, Years of Growth 1796-1851, Company of Military Historians, 1977 Partridge refused to relinquish his command when former student (but superior officer) Sylvanus Thayer was appointed to replace him as superintendent. Partridge refused to relinquish his post to a former subordinate, and was court-martialed for insubordination and neglect of duty. Though acquitted of serious wrongdoing, he chose to resign his commission in 1818, after having served his entire Army career at the academy. He received a pension for his service at West Point during the War of 1812, and after his death his wife received a pension as the widow of an 1812 veteran. Citizen soldier In the summer of 1818 Partridge was engaged in New York City to drill and instruct a volunteer infantry company, and he gave a series of lectures on the subjects of military science, fortifications, and military education. In these lectures, Partridge advocated a new program of regional military instruction and began a lifelong campaign in opposition to the existing national military academy system which would shape the rest of his life. Partridge argued that the national academies produced a professional officer class, and was creating a new military elite, which was at odds with examples of the country's great generals, such as George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Partridge proposed the nation be divided into state-based military departments, local citizen soldiers organized into militias and officers appointed by department, and units mustered on a regular basis for instruction and drill, much like the Minutemen of the well-remembered American Revolution. Further, he suggested military colleges for officer instruction be established in each department.Barnard, Alden Partridge, p. 52 Partridge was appointed chief of the surveying expedition to establish boundaries between the U.S. and Canada as required under the Treaty of Ghent. He mapped the natural watersheds of the Saint Lawrence River and Hudson River. Still consumed with plans for a military college based on his program, he decided to resign from the expedition in 1820, and retired to Norwich.Barnard, Alden Partridge, p. 54 Private military educator Norwich Historical Society =Norwich University= In 1819, Partridge founded the \\"American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy\\" in Norwich, Vermont (now known as Norwich University and located in Northfield, Vermont). Norwich is the nation's oldest private military college, based on Partridge's model of training citizen soldiers, it became the basis for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). In its first four years, the nascent academy was attended by 480 students representing 21 of the 24 states, and Partridge's program seemed successful enough to attract the attention of Middletown, Connecticut, which undertook a financial subscription of local residents as an inducement to relocate his academy. Partridge moved the school, and in Middletown, it drew nearly 1,200 students in three years, but the academy was operating again in Norwich by 1829. =Curriculum= The curriculum Partridge advanced incorporated the study of liberal arts, agriculture, modern languages, and engineering in addition to the sciences and various military subjects. Field exercises and drills, for which Partridge borrowed cannon and muskets from the federal and state governments, supplemented classroom instruction and added an element of realism to the college's program of well-rounded military education. One of America's first exercise enthusiasts, Partridge became a strong proponent of physical education as an essential part of school curriculum. As part of that program, he often led his classes on hiking expeditions in the many local mountains of New England. On one climb of Vermont's Green Mountains in 1822, Partridge led 27 pack-laden cadets on a 150-mile hike from Norwich to Manchester in just four days. =Other colleges= Awarded an honorary master's degree from Dartmouth in 1812, Partridge received the same honor from the University of Vermont in 1821, but he declined that institution's offer the same year to become its president. Partridge founded six other military institutions during his quest to reform the fledgling United States military: Virginia Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Portsmouth (1839‚Äì1846), Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol (1842‚Äì1845), Pennsylvania Military Institute at Harrisburg (1845‚Äì1848), Wilmington Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Wilmington (1846‚Äì1848), the Scientific and Military Collegiate Institute at Reading, Pennsylvania (1850‚Äì1854), Gymnasium and Military Institute at Pembroke, New Hampshire (1850‚Äì1853) and the National Scientific and Military Academy at Brandywine Springs, Delaware (1853). When John Thomas Lewis Preston worked to influence public opinion in favor of creating the Virginia Military Institute in the 1830s, Partridge assisted by providing open letters of support to members of the Virginia General Assembly and letters to the editors of Virginia newspapers. Efforts to revitalize militia Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the long period of peace following the War of 1812, Partridge and Norwich University faculty members Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman, both of whom served in the militia, worked with Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, also a militia officer, and Frederic Williams Hopkins of the Vermont militia on efforts to increase recruiting and improve training and readiness. Personal life An avid hiker, Partridge is described as \\"a noted pedestrian\\" in A History of Norwich.Goddard and Partridge, A History of Norwich, p. 233 He had reportedly already ascended Mount Monadnock and Mount Moosilauke in New Hampshire when in 1818 he walked 76 miles from Norwich to climb both Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield in two days. It rained the entire journey, according to his journal, and while one friend joined him climbing Mansfield, he hiked the balance of the expedition accompanied only by his \\"inseparable companions,\\" his knapsack and barometer.Stier, Maggie and McAdow, Ron, Into the Mountains: Stories of New England's Most Celebrated Peaks, p.88 He was an early traveler on a path to the summit of Mount Washington, New Hampshire that had been constructed in 1821 by the pioneering Ethan Crawford. A Democrat, Partridge served as Vermont's Surveyor General from 1822 to 1823.Index to the Papers of the Surveyors General, published by Vermont Secretary of State, 1918, page 141 He also served four terms in the Vermont House of Representatives, (1833, 1834, 1837 and 1839).A History of Norwich, Vermont, by Henry Villiers Partridge, 1905, pages 270 to 271History of Windsor County, Vermont, edited by Lewis Cass Aldrich and Frank R. Holmes, 1891, page 484 In addition, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives on five occasions between 1834 and 1840, losing each time to Anti-Masonic and Whig party candidate Horace Everett.General Election Results, U.S. House of Representatives from Vermont, 1833 to 1840, by Vermont Secretary of State, Archives and Records Administration, 2006, pages 4 to 6 Family In 1837, Partridge married Ann Swasey (1810-1902), with whom he had two sons, George M. C. Partridge (1838-1855) and Henry V. Partridge (1839-1920). His widow did not remarry, and survived him by 48 years.Goddard, M.E. and Partridge, Henry V., A History of Norwich, Vermont, 1905, p. 233 In 1823 Partridge adopted a young Greek boy, George Colvocoresses, whom he raised and educated at Norwich University. Colvocoresses, NU Class of 1831, was appointed to the United States Navy in 1832; from 1838-1842 he served in the United States Exploring Expedition, better known as the Wilkes Expedition of the Pacific Ocean. Three separate geographical features, two on the west coast of the U.S. and another in Antarctica, were named for Colvocoresses. Death and burial Partridge died in Norwich on January 17, 1854. He was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Norwich.

The Meteoritical Society. Retrieved on August 16, 2008. and originally known as Tomanowos by the Clackamas Chinook Native American tribe is an iron-nickel meteorite found in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the largest meteorite found in North America and the sixth largest in the world.O. Richard Norton. Rocks from Space. USA, Mountain Press, 1994. There was no impact crater at the discovery site; researchers believe the meteorite landed in what is now Canada or Montana, and was transported as a glacial erratic to the Willamette Valley during the Missoula Floods at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). It has long been held sacred by indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley, including the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (CTGRC). The meteorite is on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which acquired it in 1906. Having been seen by an estimated 40 million people over the years, and given its striking appearance, it is among the most famous meteorites.Science Channel's \\"Top Ten Meteorites\\". Retrieved on November 29th, 2010. In 2005, the CTGRC sued to have the meteorite returned to their control, ultimately reaching an agreement that gave the tribe access to the meteorite while allowing the museum to keep it as long as they are exhibiting it. Physical characteristics and formation Close-up of the meteorite The Willamette Meteorite weighs about . It is classified as a type III iron meteorite, being composed of over 91% iron and 7.62% nickel, with traces of cobalt and phosphorus. The approximate dimensions of the meteorite are tall by wide by deep. Most iron meteorites like Willamette have originated from the differentiated core of planetesimals or asteroids that collided with another object. Willamette has a recrystallized structure with only traces of a medium Widmanst√§tten pattern; it is the result of a significant impact-heating event on the parent body.^ Vagn F. Buchwald: Handbook of Iron Meteorites, University of California Press 1975. The Willamette Meteorite contains higher concentrations of various metals that are quite rare in Earth's crust. For example, iridium, one of the least abundant elements in Earth's crust, is found in the Willamette Meteorite at a concentration of 4.7 ppm, thousands of times more concentrated than in the crust. Emplacement and erosion Glacial Lake Columbia (west) and Glacial Lake Missoula (east, in blue) were south of Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The areas inundated in the Columbia and Missoula Floods are shown in red. The meteorite was rafted by the floods embedded inside an ice block. The lack of an impact crater at the discovery site was only explained after the 1920s, with the new understanding about the Missoula Floods, one of the largest floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was dragged by the glacier ice to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (known as glacial erratics by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sank in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans. The deep crevasses of the meteorite resulted from both its high-speed atmospheric entry and its subsequent weathering. Exposed to the elements for thousands of years, rainwater interacted with the mineral troilite, resulting in a form of sulfuric acid which slowly dissolved portions of the meteorite. This resulted in the gradual development of the hollows that are visible today. Modern history The Willamette Meteorite has been venerated by the Clackamas people since long before it was removed from is location in the Willamette Valley near the modern city of West Linn, Oregon. In 1902, Ellis Hughes was the first European settler to recognize the meteorite's significance. At that time the land was owned by the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. Hughes attempted to claim ownership of the meteorite, and secretly moved it to his own land. This involved 90 days of hard work to cover the 3/4 mile (1200 m) distance. The move was discovered, and after a lawsuit, the Oregon Supreme Court held that Oregon Iron and Steel Company was the legal owner.Oregon Iron Co. v. Hughes, 47 Or 313, 82 P 572 (1905).Preston, Douglas. Strange Journey: Further Travels of The Willamette Meteorite. Meteor Treasures. Retrieved on October 31, 2007. Willamette Meteorite in the early 20th century In 1905, William E. Dodge purchased the meteorite for $26,000 (around $680,000 in 2011). After displaying it at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, he donated it to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it has been on display since 1906.Geology Tour. University of Oregon: Museum of Natural History. Retrieved on October 31, 2007. The Clackamas people have long used the meteorite, which they call Tomanowos, in ceremonies. In 1999 the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (CTGRC), a confederation of Native American tribes, demanded that it be returned and filed an action pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) against the American Museum of Natural History. In response, the Museum filed a federal lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment against the CTGRC in 2000. An agreement with the Museum was reached later that year in which the meteorite would remain at the museum with tribal members being able to conduct a private ceremony around the meteorite once a year, and that ownership will be transferred to CTGRC should the museum cease to have the meteorite on display. In response to a student's request in 2007, Representative John Lim introduced a resolution that would demand that the museum return the meteorite to Oregon. The tribes said they were not consulted, they did not support the resolution, and were content with the current arrangement with the museum. The crown section of the meteorite that had been traded to the Macovich Collection for a Martian meteorite in 1997, was planned to be auctioned in October 2007, which led to claims by the CTGRC of insensitivity. Bidders dropped out when an editorial in the Portland Oregonian newspaper asserted the CTGRC would file a lawsuit against the new owner, but the CTGRC disavowed the editorial and said they had no such intent, and that they could not stop the sale. While the newspaper printed an apology, the specimen was withdrawn.Saturday, October 20, 2007 / Portland Oregonian ‚Äî Apology/Retraction on the Editorial Page A lawsuit was filed against the newspaper in Oregon Circuit Court and failed.Darryl Pitt v. Advance Publications, et al., Oregon Circuit Court, 0810-14798 (2008) A , piece of the meteorite, also with a Macovich Collection provenance, was purchased in a 2006 auction and was displayed at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon until it was returned to the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde on February 22, 2019.

The plaque reads: \\"In 1902 Ellis Hughes discovered the ton Willamette Meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States, about 2 miles N.W. of this place. Marker erected August 4, 1962 by West Linn Fair Board.\\" There is some confusion about the mass of the Willamette meteorite because of the difference between metric tons and short tons, often both called simply tons. The result is that sources report different weights, ranging from to .Harry Y. McSween. Meteorites and Their Parent Planets. Cambridge University Press, 1999.

The Tlingit people also live in the Northwest Interior of British Columbia, Canada, and in the southern Yukon Territory. There are two main Tlingit lineages or moieties within Alaska, which are subdivided into a number of clans and houses.  Tlingit moieties  The Three Frogs Pole, in Wrangell, Alaska is believed to belong to the Tlingit clans The Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska have two moieties (otherwise known as descent groups) in their society, each of which is divided into a number of clans. Each clan has its own history, songs, and totems, and each forms a social network of extended families which functions as a political unit in Tlingit society. The two moieties of the Tlingit society are the Raven (Y√©il) and Eagle/Wolf (Ch'aak'/ _G_ ooch). The latter has two names because its primary crest differs between the north and the south regions of Tlingit territory, probably due to influence from the neighboring tribes of Haida, Tsimshian and Nisga'a. Each moiety is further subdivided into clans, and each clan is subdivided into houses. Clan names, crests and political structure The Tlingit clans have names whose meaning typically reflects the foundation story of the clan. The clans are usually referred to in English by the name of their primary crest, such as Deisheetaan being called \\"Beaver Clan\\". This is not accurate since some crests may be held by multiple clans. Clans of opposite moieties occasionally claim the same crest, but such irregular ownership is usually due to a debt owed by some other clan; until the debt is paid, the clan holding the debt claims the crest of the clan which owes the debt, as a means of shaming it. Clan allegiance is governed through a matrilineal system; children are born to the mother's clan and gain their status within her family, including what was traditionally hereditary leadership positions. The parents are required to be from differing clans; the children are born from the father, but he has a lesser role in their rearing than does the mother's brothers. Not all clans listed below are extant today; some have been absorbed into other clans; others have died out due to the lack of female descendants, and a few have been lost to history. Not all the clans are independent, since clans formed in a long and fluid process. For instance, the _K_ ak'weid√≠ descend from the Deisheetaan.

Clarke described him as \\"Fort's latter-day - and much more scientific - successor.\\"Clarke, Arthur C. (1990). Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography. Gollancz. p. 110 Biography Starting in 1974, Corliss published a number of works in the \\"Sourcebook Project\\". Each volume was devoted to a scientific field (archeology, astronomy, geology, et cetera) and featured articles culled almost exclusively from scientific journals. Corliss was inspired by Charles Fort, who decades earlier also collected reports of unusual phenomena. Many of the articles in Corliss's works were earlier mentioned in Charles Fort's works. Unlike Fort, known for his idiosyncratic writing style, Corliss initially offered little in the way of his own opinions or editorial comments, preferring to let the articles speak for themselves. Corliss quoted all relevant parts of articles (often reprinting entire articles or stories, including illustrations). In some of his later Sourcebook efforts, such as the mid-1990s Biological Anomalies series, Corliss added his evaluation of both the reliability of the claims, and their ranking as anomalies. Well-documented reports from credible sources are ranked as a \\"1\\" while entirely unsubstantiated reports are rated as a \\"4\\", with \\"2\\" or \\"3\\" representing intermediate reports. Similarly, Corliss's uses a rating of \\"1\\" for anomalies that cannot be explained by existing scientific theories, while a \\"4\\" describes phenomena that are unusual but do not challenge scientific theories. Corliss wrote many other books and articles, notably including 13 educational books about astronomy, outer space and space travel for NASA and a similar number for the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Science Foundation.Adrian Hope. \\"Finding a Home for Stray Fact\\". New Scientist. July 14, 1977. 83. Reception In his book Unexplained!, Jerome Clark describes Corliss as \\"essentially conservative in outlook\\". He explains, \\"Corliss [is] more interested in unusual weather, ball lighting, geophysical oddities, extraordinary mirages, and the like -- in short, anomalies that, while important in their own right, are far less likely to outrage mainstream scientists than those that delighted Fort, such as UFOs, monstrous creatures, or other sorts of extraordinary events and entities.\\"Jerome Clark. \\"Sourcebook Project\\" Unexplained!. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 466-7. Arthur C. Clarke said: The meteorologist Charles A. Doswell has praised the research of Corliss, stating his documentation of anomalies was intriguing.Doswell, Charles A. (1984). Severe and Unusual Weather by Joe R. Eagleman; Tornados, Dark Days, Anomalous Precipitation, and Related Weather Phenomena: A Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies by William R. Corliss. American Scientist. Vol. 72, No. 1. p. 83. However, the geologist Henry Faul has criticized Corliss. In a review for Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena, Faul noted: In a review for a book that documented astronomical anomalies, the astronomer Joseph Veverka wrote that Corliss had shown negligence of the scientific literature for more than a decade and made incorrect statements.Veverka, Joseph. (1986). The Moon and the Planets: A Catalog of Astronomical Anomalies by William R. Corliss. American Scientist. Vol. 74, No. 6. p. 670. However, Richard Baum wrote a mostly positive review, stating that it was an objective work and \\"his reviews are concise and well-referenced, and if on occasion his examples are questionable we do at least have the benefit of the bibliographies which will be useful to historians.\\"Book Review: The moon and planets: a catalog of astronomical anomalies. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, vol. 97, no. 4 (1987) p. 233. A reviewer in the New Scientist, noted that the book Incredible Life had an agenda to challenge evolutionary theory as Corliss believed that natural selection fails to explain biological mysteries.Cherfas, Jeremy.

New stadium  Eagle Stadium Due to the program's popularity and student population, the school was authorized, via an approved April 2009 referendum, to build an 18,000 seat stadium (Allen Eagle Stadium) for the team. The stadium (which cost nearly $60 million) opened for the 2012 football season. It is the fifth largest high school stadium in the state, but the largest designed for the use of only one team. The new facility houses a weight room, wrestling practice facility, and indoor golfing facility. On February 27, 2014, the stadium was closed due to cracking in concrete making it unsafe to use. The 2014 varsity football season played every game on the road, and still managed to go undefeated and win their third consecutive title earning the nickname \\"Road Warriors\\" by the local media.

A person possessing the beatific vision reaches, as a member of redeemed humanity in the communion of saints, perfect salvation in its entirety, i.e. heaven. The notion of vision stresses the intellectual component of salvation, though it encompasses the whole of human experience of joy, happiness coming from seeing God finally face to face and not imperfectly through faith. (1 Cor 13:11‚Äì12).Cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church 163, 1028, 1045Cf. It is related to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief in theosis, the Wesleyan notion of Christian perfection,Wesley, Charles. \\"Maker, in Whom We Live.\\" The United Methodist Hymnal.

History Gustave Dore's image of the beatific vision, from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. In Christianity, the Bible states that God \\"dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has even seen or can see\\" (1 Timothy 6:16), but when God reveals himself to us in heaven we will then see him face to face (1 Corinthians 13:12). This concept has been termed \\"the beatific vision of God\\" by theologians of the Catholic Church as well as various Protestant denominations, including the Lutheran Church and the Methodist Church. Saint Cyprian wrote of the saved's seeing God in the Kingdom of Heaven. > How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, to be > honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with Christ your > Lord and God... to delight in the joy of immortality in the Kingdom of > Heaven with the righteous and God's friends! Monsignor Edward A. Pace in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907) defined the Beatific Vision: > The immediate knowledge of God which the angelic spirits and the souls of > the just enjoy in Heaven. It is called \\"vision\\" to distinguish it from the > mediate knowledge of God which the human mind may attain in the present > life. And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds > perfect happiness, the vision is termed \\"beatific.\\"Pace, Edward. \\"Beatific > Vision.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton > Company, 1907. 5 Jan. 2011 . Methodist co-founder Charles Wesley, in his 1747 hymn \\"Maker, in Whom We Live\\", described union with God through the Holy Spirit as \\"beatific sight\\": > Spirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore / thy sacred energy, and bless > thine heart-renewing power. / No angel tongues can tell thy love's ecstatic > height, / the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight. In the Catholic church =Official teaching= The beatific vision is when God, though transcendent, opens himself up to man and gives man the capacity to contemplate God in his heavenly glory.CCC 1028 Contemplation is the prayer of silently focusing on God and heeding his word; in other words, contemplation is the prayer of uniting with God.CCC 2715 The beatific vision, then, is ultimate union with God; indeed, it comes from sharing in God's holy nature via sanctifying grace.CCC 163 Because God is beatitude and holiness itself, the beatific vision entails ultimate beatitude and holiness.CCC 1045 The beatific vision is a grace and a privilege intended for every man and angel, since God created men and angels to enjoy the beatific vision; the beatific vision is the ultimate purpose of each person's and angel's life.CCC 1722 =Thomas Aquinas= Thomas Aquinas defined the beatific vision as the human being's \\"final end\\" in which one attains to a perfect happiness. Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. \\"Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek.\\"STh I‚ÄìII, q., 3, a. 8. But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect ‚Äì and this is God. STh I‚ÄìII, q. 2, a. 8. And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the \\"light of glory\\" so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes Psalm 36:9 on this point: \\"In your light we shall see light.\\")STh I, q. 12, a. 4. Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect \\"ideas\\" or \\"images\\" of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.STh I, q. 12, a. 2. The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any created image of him. This union comes about by a kind of \\"seeing\\" perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of \\"seeing\\" is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.Summa Theologiae, I‚ÄìII, qq. 2‚Äì5. According to Aquinas, the Beatific Vision surpasses both faith and reason. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind's innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly. Summa Theologiae The Theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas thinks that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself. Summa Contra Gentiles Thus only the fullness of the Beatific Vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting St Paul, Aquinas notes \\"We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face\\" (i Cor. 13:12). The Beatific Vision is the final reward for those saints elect by God to partake in and \\"enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself\\" in the next life. Summa Contra Gentiles =Roman Catechism= According to the Roman Catechism, the saints in heaven see God, whereby they share in God's nature, wherewith they are truly and always happy. The catechism elaborates that the saints' happiness includes not just joy, but also glory (knowledge of one another's dignity), honor (reverence for one another as adopted sons of God), and peace (fulfillment of all the heart's desires). Moreover, the catechism adds, the beatific vision will, on Judgment Day, make the saints' resurrected bodies impassible (free from inconvenience, suffering, and death), bright as the angels, agile (free from the limitations of space-time), and subtle (as subject to the soul as the soul is subject to God). =Pope John XXII and the Beatific Vision controversy= Pope John XXII (1316‚Äì1334) caused a controversy involving the Beatific Vision.Marc Dykmans, Les sermons de Jean XXII sur la vision b√©atifique, Rome, 1973 He said not as Pope but as a private theologian that the saved do not attain the Beatific Vision until Judgment Day, a view more consistent with soul sleep.Louise Bourdua, Anne Dunlop Art and the Augustinian order in early Renaissance Italy The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day. He never proclaimed his belief as doctrine but rather as an opinion (see ex cathedra, as defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870). The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John backed away from his novel views to the more standard understanding. His successor, Pope Benedict XII, declared it doctrine that the saved see Heaven (and thus, God) before Judgment Day. =Pope Pius X= Pope Pius X in his catechism taught that, while no one can comprehend heaven, God has revealed that heaven consists of the beatific vision, which after death the soul enjoys and after Judgment Day the body and the soul will enjoy together. He further taught that the amount of the beatific vision that one will enjoy will be based on one's merits. He also taught that the saints' resurrected bodies will be endowed with impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtlety. =Catechism of the Catholic Church= According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the beatific vision is God opening himself in an inexhaustible way to the saints,CCC 1045 so that they can see him face to face,CCC 1028 and thereby share in his nature,CCC 1023 and therefore enjoy eternal, definitive, supreme, perfect, and ever new happiness.Catechism Compendium 362CCC 1024CCC 2781 The catechism teaches that this happiness includes not just communion and perfect life with the Trinity and the saints, but also the fulfillment of all the heart's desires \\\\- including, on Judgment Day, the body being glorified,CCC 999 even endowed with impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtletyCCC 645 \\\\- and continual cooperation with God's willCCC 1029 \\\\- including praying for all other people, even proffering one's merits to God for others' sake.CCC 956 The catechism elaborates that the beatific vision is a grace and a privilege intended for everyone to attain,CCC 1722 but to enjoy according to each person's merit,CCC 2011 and that the beatific vision is attained immediately after death - or after purgatoryCCC 1032 \\\\- yet it is already foretasted in baptismCCC 163CCC 1003 and in the eucharist.CCC 1000CCC 1391 The catechism also teaches that the beatific vision is expressed in different ways in the New Testament: the kingdom of God, the vision of God, eternal life, divine adoption, a share in the divine nature, the joy of the Lord, and rest in God.CCC 1720 =Catholic Encyclopedia= The Catholic Encyclopedia defines the beatific vision as the immediate knowledge of God enjoyed by all the heavenly creatures.Catholic Encyclopedia: Beatific Vision It explains that the vision of God is called \\"beatific\\" because by seeing God the mind finds perfect happiness, and called \\"vision\\" because the sight of God in heaven is not the same as mediate knowledge of God.

Photosystems are found in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. They are located in the chloroplasts of plants and algae, and in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. There are two kinds of photosystems: II and I. Reaction centers At the heart of a photosystem lies the reaction center, which is an enzyme that uses light to reduce molecules (provide with electrons). This reaction center is surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that enhance the absorption of light. Two families of reaction centers in photosystems exist: type I reaction centers (such as photosystem I (P700) in chloroplasts and in green-sulphur bacteria and type II reaction centers (such as photosystem II (P680) in chloroplasts and in non-sulphur purple bacteria. Each of the photosystem can be identified by the wavelength of light to which it is most reactive (700 and 680 nanometers, respectively for PSI and PSII in chloroplasts), the amount and type of light-harvesting complex present and the type of terminal electron acceptor used. Type I photosystems use ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur cluster proteins as terminal electron acceptors, while type II photosystems ultimately shuttle electrons to a quinone terminal electron acceptor. Both reaction center types are present in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, and work together to form a unique photosynthetic chain able to extract electrons from water, creating oxygen as a byproduct. Structure A reaction center comprises several (>24 or >33) protein subunits, that provide a scaffold for a series of cofactors. The cofactors can be pigments (like chlorophyll, pheophytin, carotenoids), quinones, or iron-sulfur clusters. Relationship between photosystems I and II For oxygenic photosynthesis, both photosystems I and II are required. Oxygenic photosynthesis can be performed by plants and cyanobacteria; cyanobacteria are believed to be the progenitors of the photosystem-containing chloroplasts of eukaryotes. Photosynthetic bacteria that cannot produce oxygen have a single photosystem similar to either. When photosystem II absorbs light, electrons in the reaction-center chlorophyll are excited to a higher energy level and are trapped by the primary electron acceptors. Photoexcited electrons travel through the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I via an electron transport chain set in the thylakoid membrane. This energy fall is harnessed, (the whole process termed chemiosmosis), to transport hydrogen (H+) through the membrane, into the thylakoid lumen, to provide a potential energy difference between the thylakoid lumen space and the chloroplast stroma, which amounts to a proton-motive force that can be used to generate ATP. The protons are transported by the plastoquinone. If electrons only pass through once, the process is termed noncyclic photophosphorylation. When the electron reaches photosystem I, it fills the electron deficit of the reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I. ATP is generated when the ATP synthase transports the protons present in the lumen to the stroma, through the membrane. The electrons may either continue to go through cyclic electron transport around PS I or pass, via ferredoxin, to the enzyme NADP+ reductase. Electrons and hydrogen ions are added to NADP+ to form NADPH. This reducing agent is transported to the Calvin cycle to react with glycerate 3-phosphate, along with ATP to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the basic building-block from which plants can make a variety of substances.

Aase syndrome is thought to be an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Aase%20Syndrome \\"Aase Syndrome\\" The genetic basis of the disease is not known. The anemia is caused by underdevelopment of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed. It is named after the American paediatricians Jon Morton Aase and David Weyhe Smith, who characterized it in 1968. Signs and symptoms Among the presentation are: * Mildly slowed growth * Pale skin * Delayed closure of fontanelles (soft spots) * Narrow shoulders * Triple jointed thumbs, absent or small knuckles, decreased skin creases at finger joints * Inability to fully extend the joints from birth (congenital contractures) * Cleft palate * Deformed ears * Droopy eyelids =Complications= * Complications related to anemia include weakness, fatigue, and decreased oxygenation of the blood. * Decreased white blood cells alter the body's ability to fight infection. * If a heart defect exists, it may cause multiple complications (depending on the specific defect). * Severe cases have been associated with still birth or early death. Cause Some cases of Aase syndrome (45%) have been shown to be inherited, and are due to a change in one gene which makes ribosomal proteins. However, many cases are not inherited and occur without a known cause. Diagnosis * A CBC (complete blood count) will show anemia and a decrease in the white blood cell count. * An echocardiogram may reveal heart defects (ventricular septal defect is most common). * X-rays will show skeletal abnormalities as described above. * A bone marrow biopsy may be performed. Prevention As with most genetic diseases there is no way to prevent the entire disease. With prompt recognition and treatment of infections in childhood, the complications of low white blood cell counts may be limited. Treatment Frequent blood transfusions are given in the first year of life to treat anemia. Prednisone may be given, although this should be avoided in infancy because of side effects on growth and brain development. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if other treatment fails. Prognosis Anemia usually resolves over the years.

It is primarily home to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League but also the Portland High School Bulldogs and Deering High School Rams baseball teams. The stadium is named for Edson B. Hadlock Jr., a long-time Portland High School baseball coach and physics teacher and member of the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame. History and development The park opened on April 18, 1994 with a capacity of 6,000. A year later, 500 seats were added, boosting capacity to 6,500. Expansion in 1998 increased capacity to 6,860 and in 2002 to 6,975. About 400 seats were added in right field before the start of the 2006 season, and the park currently seats 7,368. Hadlock Field is located between Interstate 295, the historic Fitzpatrick Stadium, and the Portland Exposition Building, the second-oldest arena in continuous operation in the United States. In 2003, when the Sea Dogs affiliated with the Boston Red Sox, a replica Green monster, called the Maine Monster, was added to left field to match the original at the Red Sox' Fenway Park. A replica Citgo sign and Coke bottle were added as well to make the field look even more like Fenway Park. In 2006, the tenant Sea Dogs were Eastern League champions. The left-field fence is 315 feet from home plate, the center field-fence is 400 feet, while the fence in right-field is 330 feet away. New video boards were added prior to the 2014 season. Field of Dreams Day at Hadlock Field is always a special date on the Portland Sea Dogs schedule. It is celebrated on the first Sunday of September and is usually a sold out event, which features the team wearing 1926 Portland Eskimos uniforms.

Wallace is known for his tough and wide-ranging interviews, for which he is often compared to his father, 60 Minutes journalist Mike Wallace. As a teenager, Wallace became an assistant to Walter Cronkite during the 1964 Republican National Convention. After graduating from Harvard University, he worked as a national reporter for The Boston Globe where he was described by his boss as an \\"aggressive and ambitious reporter\\". After seeing the impact television had on news at the 1972 Republican National Convention, he focused on working on broadcast news, first at NBC (1975‚Äì1988) where he served as a White House correspondent alongside contemporaries CBS's Lesley Stahl and ABC's Sam Donaldson. Wallace also worked the anchor for NBC Nightly News and host of Meet the Press. He then worked for ABC, where he served as an anchor for Primetime Thursday and Nightline (1989‚Äì2003). Wallace is the only person to have served as host and moderator of more than one of the major U.S. political Sunday morning talk shows, which he did during his time at NBC. Since 2003, Wallace has hosted Fox News Sunday, where he has gained praise and acclaim for his interviews with politicians such as Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Russian president Vladimir Putin. According to a 2018 poll, he was ranked as being one of the most trusted TV news anchors in America. Wallace is also known for his skills as a presidential debate moderator. He made history when he was chosen to moderate the final 2016 United States presidential debate between Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, this being the first for a Fox News journalist. He was chosen again to moderate the first 2020 United States presidential debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. After this debate, he referred to it as chaotic and acknowledged that he should have been tighter on President Trump's interruptions from the very beginning. Wallace has won a Peabody Award, three Emmy Awards, the duPont‚ÄìColumbia Silver Baton Award, and a Paul White lifetime achievement award. Early life and education Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois, to longtime CBS 60 Minutes reporter Mike Wallace and Norma Kaphan. Wallace is Jewish;\\"7 Things About Debate Moderator Chris Wallace ‚Äî Starting With He's Jewish\\" by Thea Glassman, The Forward, October 19, 2016 both his parents were Jewish.Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish By Abigail Pogrebin retrieved March 30, 2013. He was named Christopher because he was born on Columbus Day. His parents divorced when he was one year old; he grew up with his mother and stepfather Bill Leonard, President of CBS News. Leonard gave him early exposure to political journalism, hiring him as an assistant to Walter Cronkite at the 1964 Republican National Convention. Wallace did not develop a relationship with his father Mike until the age of 14. Wallace attended the Hotchkiss School and Harvard College. He first reported news on-air for WHRB, the student radio station at Harvard. He memorably covered the 1969 student occupation of University Hall and was detained by Cambridge policemen, using his one phone call to sign off a report from Cambridge City Jail with \\"This is Chris Wallace from WHRB News reporting from Middlesex County Jail in custody.\\" Career = Early career: The Boston Globe = Wallace as a reporter for WBBM-TV, 1975 Although accepted at Yale Law School, he decided to work as a national reporter for The Boston Globe where he was described by his boss as an \\"aggressive and ambitious reporter\\". Wallace soon focused his attention towards broadcast television news when he noticed all the reporters at the 1972 political conventions were watching the proceedings on televisions instead of in person. For a time in the early 1970s, he worked for the Chicago station WBBM-TV, which was owned and operated by CBS. =1975‚Äì1988: NBC News= Nightly News, Meet the Press Wallace began his network journalism career with NBC in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years, as a reporter with WNBC-TV in New York City. Wallace then transferred to NBC's Washington bureau as a political correspondent for NBC News and later served as Washington co-anchor and news reader for the Today show with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley in 1982. That same year, he also served as chief White House correspondent (1982‚Äì1989), anchor of the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News (1982‚Äì1984, 1986‚Äì1987), and moderator of Meet the Press (1987‚Äì1988). Some journalists have described Wallace's style as confrontational. During President Ronald Reagan's news conference in March 1987, when Reagan admitted to dealing arms for hostages, Wallace asked Reagan why he had denied that Israel was involved with the arms sales to Iran \\"when you knew that wasn't true.\\" =1989‚Äì2003: ABC News= Primetime Thursday, Nightline Wallace with Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan in 1985 Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. Sam Donaldson, ABC's outgoing chief White House correspondent, said he was 'delighted' and 'very pleased' that Wallace, his journalistic rival, will be joining the network saying, 'I've always liked his work, I think he's going to be a plus.' At ABC News, Wallace was the senior correspondent for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli government did not want to advertise where the Scuds landed, to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Host Ted Koppel cut him off and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location. Wallace received a News and Documentary Emmy Award nomination for his reporting on Primetime Live segment: Hope Sells. =2003‚Äìpresent: Fox News= Fox News Sunday (2003‚Äìpresent) Wallace interviews Maryland governor Larry Hogan in 2015. After another 14 years at ABC, Wallace left in 2003 to join Fox News. Wallace began hosting Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace in 2003 after replacing Tony Snow. Wallace along with Shepard Smith gained a reputation at FOX for their reputable status as journalists on the network. In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, Howard Kurtz wrote, \\"Fox seems to be inching toward more conventional journalism.\\" When asked about his political opinions, Wallace stated, \\"Do I have political opinions? Absolutely. But I vote for the person, and I've voted for Republicans and Democrats and independents over the course of my life. I feel very strongly that you try not to let that affect the way you report the news.\\" Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes called Wallace \\"one of the best interviewers in the business. ... I have no idea what he thinks personally, but he asks tough questions of everybody.\\" Throughout his 17 years at FOX, Wallace has participated in coverage of nearly every major political event and has also secured several high-profile interviews with dignitaries and U.S leaders. In February 2009, he secured Fox's first interview with President Barack Obama. On March 3, 2016, Wallace joined Bret Baier, and Megyn Kelly in moderating the 2016 Republican Party Presidential debate on Fox News. In 2017, he interviewed President Donald Trump for his first interview since being elected. Third presidential debate (2016) Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace moderating the 2016 Republican Party Presidential debate The Commission on Presidential Debates selected Chris Wallace as moderator of the third presidential debate, held on October 19, 2016, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This was the first time a Fox News anchor had moderated a general election presidential debate. After he was selected, Wallace controversially said, \\"it's not my job\\" to fact-check candidates, but that it was the job of the opposing candidate.Why moderators aren't the best option for fact-checking debates, By David Uberti, CJR, September 12, 2016. He received notable praise from both sides of the aisle for his tough questioning of both presidential candidates at that last presidential debate of the 2016 election. Afterwards, Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post said that, despite her strong disapproval of other Fox News commentators, \\"No one could watch the final debate and deny that Chris Wallace is among the best in the business.\\"The mainstreaming of racism on Fox News, By Jennifer Rubin October 26, 2016. Interview with Vladimir Putin (2018) Wallace interviewing Vladimir Putin in 2018 In July 2018, Wallace conducted an interview with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Wallace questioned Putin about why so many of his political opponents end up dead, and sought to hand Putin papers containing the indictment of 12 Russian agents for interference in the 2016 election. Putin declined to touch the papers. According to The Washington Post's Aaron Blake, Putin was \\"clearly frustrated by a journalist actually challenging him\\". His interview earned himself a News and Documentary Emmy Award award for Outstanding Live Interview. It was the first News and Documentary Award in Fox News' history. Covering of the Kavanaugh hearings In September 2018, Wallace covered the Supreme Court hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, during which Kavanaugh was accused by multiple women including Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault. Wallace described Ford's testimony as \\"extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible...nobody could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on his life, on her life, and not have your heart, go out to her. She obviously was traumatized by an event.\\" He also described the cross-examination format as \\"a disaster for the Republicans.\\" When Ford's testimony was criticized by conservative pundits, Wallace discussed how his daughters had related their own previously undisclosed experiences. Wallace said that they \\"hadn't told their parents, I don't know if they told their friends. Certainly had never reported it to police...But the point is that there are teenage girls who don't tell stories to a lot of people, and then it comes up, and I don't think we can disregard that, I don't think we can disregard Christine Blasey Ford and the seriousness of this. I think that would be a big mistake.\\" Covering of the Impeachment of Donald Trump On January 27, 2020 Wallace got into a heated exchange with conservative pundit Katie Pavlich of TownHall.com on Fox News Sunday as to whether or not additional witnesses should be allowed to testify during the 2020 Impeachment trial of Donald Trump in the Senate. Pavlich argued that Republicans should be allowed to deny Democrats the right to call witnesses during the trial citing the 1998 Investigation and Impeachment of Bill Clinton. Wallace objected stating, \\"So we just shouldn't listen to what John Bolton has to say?, elaborating, \\"To say in the Clinton investigation, these people who were interviewed by the House ‚Äî one, they weren't ‚Äî and to say that it wasn't done by the Justice Department... It wasn't done because the Justice Department refused to carry out the investigation! Get your facts straight!\\" Interview with Donald Trump (2020) On July 19, 2020, Wallace sat down with President Donald Trump for a wide-ranging interview outside The White House. The interview gained widespread social media attraction and news attraction for its content. Wallace earned sporadic praise for holding Trump accountable and fact-checking him in real time. In the midst of the ongoing nationwide Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd, Wallace pressed Trump on his claim that Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee wanted to \\"defund and abolish\\" the police by replying \\"No, sir, he does not.\\" This was later proven to be true, through several quotes by Joe Biden himself. Joe Biden's opinions have evolved from \\"defunding\\" the police to \\"re-imagining\\" the police. In reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallace also challenged Trump on his exaggerated claims concerning the mortality rate and testing for COVID-19. When confronted by the statistics, the President responded: \\"I'll be right eventually.\\" Many have compared the interview style with that of Wallace's father, 60 Minutes journalist Mike Wallace. This includes Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University who teaches a class on \\"the art of the interview\\", who stated, \\"He's very good at this. He's been doing this for a long time. And he's got the Wallace DNA.\\" Many noticed Trump's awkwardness during the interview, including Meghan McCain who stated on The View that, \\"it was the first time I've really seen President Trump squirm.\\" First presidential debate (2020) The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) selected Wallace as moderator of the first presidential debate, held on September 29, 2020, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The debate was deemed a \\"disaster\\" by various news pundits for its lack of decorum, civility, and content. President Trump interrupted, taunted, and bullied Biden throughout the debate which prompted Biden to tell Trump \\"will you shut up man\\", and also calling him a \\"clown\\". During the debate Wallace tried to gain control numerous times including stopping the debate and telling the candidates, specifically Trump, \\"So here's the deal...I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions, I'm appealing to you sir\\". Other appearances Wallace in 2010 In July 2019, Wallace appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to promote a documentary made on his father, Mike Wallace is Here. In December 2019, Wallace stated at the Washington Media Museum that \\"Trump is engaged in the most direct sustained assault on freedom of the press in our history\\". He also stated that in his 50-year career in journalism his highlights include \\"spending a week with Mother Teresa in Calcutta\\", as well as covering Reagan across the world for ABC News, and interviewing Putin in Helsinki, asking him \\"Why do so many people who oppose you end up dead?\\" Author In June 2020, Wallace published his first book, Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days That Changed the World, () with Mitch Weiss. The book received positive reviews and spent multiple weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.

It conducts research in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the high and mid latitude oceans. Additional research topics are: North Sea research, marine biological monitoring, and technical marine developments. The institute was founded in 1980 and is named after meteorologist, climatologist, and geologist Alfred Wegener.  Research  The institute has three major departments: *Climate System Department, which studies oceans, ice and atmosphere as physical and chemical systems. *Biosciences Department, which studies the biological processes in marine and coastal ecosystems. *Geoscientific Department, which studies climate development, especially as revealed by sediments.  Facilities  The institute is distributed over several sites within North Germany and the Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research (OSL) at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in Saint Petersburg as Russian-German cooperation in the field of Arctic research, named after the polar explorer Otto Schmidt. =Bremerhaven= Building D resembles the stern of a ship. The headquarters was founded by Gotthilf Hempel. Nowadays, the AWI has several buildings within the city of Bremerhaven. Building E. The Harbour Tower on the right is directly in front of the Weser Tower. * Building D is located next to the old port (German: Alter Hafen). The dark clink-brick building was designed by Oswald Mathias Ungers in 1985 who won the architecture-award BDA-prize for the building. It hosts the AWI library, the main lecture hall and various laboratories and offices. * The main building E is next to the lock Doppelschleuse. Main characteristics are the chequered tiles and the fact that there are three office towers. The building was designed by Otto Steidle and constructed in 2004 as an extension of the complex A,B,C. * House F is close to the Weser ferry at the Geeste estuary. The housing association St√§WoG (German: St√§dtische Wohnungsgesellschaft) renovated the building of the former nautical college (German: Hochschule f√ºr Seefahrt) in 1999. For this reason, there is a planetarium which is nowadays used by the Bremerhaven's friends of the stars. * The small Bathymetry Building is located close to the radar tower. * The Nordsee Villa formerly belonged to the fast-food restaurant chain Nordsee and hosts a few offices of AWI. Nowadays it is a Haus der Technik and part of the oldest German institute for technical further education with close cooperation to RWTH Aachen and other universities. * The Harbour Warehouse (German: Hafenlager) is located within the Lloyd Werft, see Lloyd Werft Map. =Potsdam= The Forschungstelle Potsdam is situated on the Telegrafenberg next to Potsdam. It belongs to AWI since 1992. The research focuses on the atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry of the atmosphere on the one hand and periglacial research on the other hand. =Sylt= The Wadden Sea Station Sylt is located on the North German island Sylt. It was founded in 1924 as an oyster laboratory to study the decline of oyster stocks and in order to study how they could be cultivated. In 1937, the name changed from oyster laboratory to Wadden Sea station. The station grew, and in 1949 the station was shifted from the northernmost edge of the island to the current location, next to the harbor of List. In 1998 the station became part of AWI. Nowadays, there are about 30 scientists and technicians. Two guest houses allow to perform workshops and video conferences are possible with the AWI headquarters. The research focuses on coast ecology and coast geology. In the 1930 there have been oyster reefs below the mussel banks at the water level. Below these, there have been sabellaria reefs which have been destroyed by fishery. Nowadays there are only the mussel banks left. =Helgoland= The Biologische Anstalt Helgoland is situated at on the island Heligoland (German: Helgoland). The station exists since 1892. Scientists study the ecology of the North Sea in this research station. Since 1962, at Heligoland roadstead , phytoplankton and water samples are taken every weekday morning, the turbidity is measured (e.g. using a Secchi disk) and other parameters are recorded. The North Sea warmed by 1.65 ¬∞C since the start of the time series. Stations The institute maintains several research stations around the Arctic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent. =Neumayer Station= The Neumayer-Station III located at , about away from the previous station, Neumayer II which is now abandoned and covered by a thick ice cover. The new station (Webcam) is a futuristic-looking combined platform above the snow surface offering space for research, operations, and living since 2009. The station stands on 16 hydraulic posts which are used to adjust the building to the growing snow cover. Below the station PistenBullys and other equipment are stored an underground garage. In summer, the station can host up to 40 people. The station contains several laboratories, has a weather balloon launching facility, and a hospital with telemedical equipment. =Dallmann Laboratory= In cooperation with the Instituto Ant√°rtico Argentino (IAA), in 1994 the AWI opened a research station on King George Island at . The station is named after Eduard Dallmann, a German whaler, trader and Polar explorer living next to Bremen. =Koldewey Station= The Koldewey Station at is named after the German polar explorer Carl Koldewey and part of the French-German Arctic Research AWIPEV Arctic in Ny-√Ölesund on Svalbard. =Kohnen Station= The Kohnen Station was established in 2001 as logistical base for ice core drilling in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica at =Samoylov Station= The Samoylov Station at lays within the Lena Delta close to the Laptev Sea. The station was set up as a logistic base for permafrost studies by the Lena Delta Reserve (LDR) and the AWI. Ships Altogether there are six ships that belong to AWI. =RV Polarstern= The AWI flagship is Germany's research icebreaker RV Polarstern. The ship was commissioned in 1982. The double-hulled icebreaker is operational up to temperatures as low as ‚àí50 ¬∞C (‚àí58 ¬∞F). Polarstern can break through sea ice of 1.5 m thickness at a speed of 5 knots, thicker ice must be broken by ramming. A possible but not probable follow-up flagship might be the research icebreaker Aurora Borealis. =RV Heincke= The vessel RV Heincke is a multifunctional and low-noise ship for research in ice-free waters, named after German zoologist and ichthyologist Friedrich Heincke . With a length of 54.6 m, a width of 12.5 m and a draft 4.16 m, the ship is categorized as \\"medium research vessel\\" within the German research fleet. The ship was put into operation in 1990, its building costs have been around 16 Millionen Euro. On the vessel, up to 12 scientists and 8 crew members can work for up to 30 passage days. This corresponds to an operating range of roughly 7500 nautical miles. The shipowner is Briese Schiffahrts GmbH & Co. KG from Leer, a city in East Frisia. =RV Uth√∂rn= Silhouette of RV Uth√∂rn, the length overall is 30.5 m, it has 2.5 m draft and a width of 8.5 m The research cutter RV Uth√∂rn is named after the small island Uth√∂rn next to Sylt in the North Sea. The vessel is regularly on research tours in German Bight, but is also used to supply the AWI branch Biologische Anstalt Helgoland mentioned above. Two scientists and 4 crew members can live and work on board for up to 180 days, but the vessel mainly used for day trips. Another operation purpose are short term cruises of a few hours for up to 25 students to demonstrate oceanographic and biological sampling methods. Being commissioned in 1982 RV Uth√∂rn replaced a vessel with the same name which was built in 1947 and had a length of 24 m. The current vessel is powered by two V12 four-stroke Diesel engines manufactured by the company MWM GmbH from Mannheim. Each engine delivers up to 231 kW to a controllable-pitch propeller; the maximal speed is around 10 kn. On the working deck, there is a dry lab and a laboratory for wet work like sorting fish. The ship is equipped with standard sampling devices: You may find on board a demersal trawl, a Van Veen Grab Sampler, Niskin bottles, and even deprecated reversing thermometers for teaching purposes. =Mya, Aade and Diker= The research catamaran Mya is specially designed for research in the intertidal zone, it can fall dry at low tide. The main research area is the Wadden Sea. Last but not least, there are two small motor boats, Aade and Diker for sampling and diving operations around Heligoland. Aircraft =Past aircraft= Polar 5 in June 2008 The Alfred Wegener Institute operated five airplanes under the name of Polar, those being:Ehemalige Flugzeuge Alfred Wegener Institute ‚Äì Former airplanes, accessed: 18 April 2009 * Polar 1, a Dornier 128 commissioned in 1983, now in possession of the TU Braunschweig * Polar 2, a Dornier 228 commissioned in 1983, still in service with the AWI * Polar 3, like Polar 2 commissioned in 1983, shot down possibly by SA-2 Guideline missile on 24 February 1985 over Western Sahara * Polar 4, a Dorniers 228 commissioned in 1985, severely damaged at a landing at the British Rothera Research Station in 2005, now on display at the Institute =Current fleet= AWI currently uses two Basler BT-67. These planes are 20 m long, 5.2 m high and have a wingspan of 29 m. The empty weight is 7680 kg, with ski landing gear it weighs 8340 kg. The minimal cruising speed is 156 km/h, the maximum is SFA. Without payload, the flying range is around 3900 km. The planes are maintained by the company Kenn Borek Air located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Polar 5 The plane hull was built in 1942 but completely refurbished after the AWI acquired the plane in 2007. Since then it \\"has supplied a large volume of valuable data\\" said Prof. Heinrich Miller, the former director of the AWI. Polar 6 This plane with the call sign C-FHGF was acquired by AWI in 2011. The BMBF, the German Federal Minister of Education and Research funded the purchase and equipping of the plane with a total of 9.78 million euros. History Ski-equipped Polar 4 * In January 2005, Polar 4 was severely damaged during a rough landing at the British over-wintering station Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. As it was impossible to repair the plane, the aircraft had to be decommissioned. Since then, scientific and logistical tasks of polar flights have been performed by Polar 2. =Polar 3 incident= On 24 February 1985, the Polar 3, a research airplane of the institute of the type Dornier 228, was shot down by guerrillas of the Polisario Front over West Sahara. All three crew members died. Polar 3, together with unharmed Polar 2, was on its way back from Antarctica and had taken off in Dakar, Senegal, to reach Arrecife, Canary Islands.Aviation safety network ‚Äì Report on Polar 3 accessed: 18 April 2009  See also  * Open access in Germany References External links * Official website Category:Research institutes in Germany Category:Environmental research institutes Category:Earth science research institutes Category:Organisations based in Bremerhaven Category:Environmental organizations established in 1980 Category:Research institutes established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in West Germany Category:Antarctic research Category:Non-profit organisations based in Bremen (state) ","title":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research"},{"id":"1126139","text":"Sandstone cliffs in Bahia, Brazil Nests in sandstone cliffs in Bahia, Brazil Lear's macaw at Canudos Biological Station in Bahia state, Brazil Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari), also known as the indigo macaw, is a large all-blue Brazilian parrot, a member of a large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. It was first described by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Lear's macaw is long and weighs around . It is metallic blue with a faint, often barely visible, tinge of green, and a yellow patch of skin at the base of the heavy, black bill. This macaw is rare with a highly restricted range. Its lifespan can exceed 30‚Äì50 years. Taxonomy Lear's macaw was first described by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856, but the rarely seen bird was not considered a distinct species until 1978, when ornithologist Helmut Sick finally located the wild population. It was named after the poet, author, and artist, Edward Lear, who published many drawings and paintings of live parrots in zoos and collections. One of his paintings in his book Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots strongly resemble this species, although at the time it was believed to be a hyacinth macaw ‚Äî a species which is larger, darker, and has a differently shaped patch of yellow skin adjacent to the base of the bill. Description Lear's macaw is long and weighs around . The body, tail, and wings are dark blue and the head is a slightly paler shade. It has an area of pale-yellow skin adjacent to the base of its beak, and orange-yellow eye rings. It has a large, blackish beak and dark grey feet. Lear's macaw is similar to the larger hyacinth macaw and the slightly smaller glaucous macaw. The hyacinth macaw can be distinguished by its darker plumage, lack of greenish tinge, and a differently shaped patch of yellow skin adjacent to the base of the bill. The glaucous macaw is paler and has a more greyish head.Lear's macaw, NE Brazil. Behavior When a group of macaws is searching for food or a new nesting ground, a small advance party of males \\"scouts out\\" the approaching terrain. In addition, when danger is found on these hunts for new territory, the macaws let out their signature call which can be heard for miles. The macaw can reach flight speeds up to 35 miles per hour to escape predators or poachers. =Feeding= The primary diet of Lear's macaw is the licuri palm nuts (as many as 350 per day), but also Melanoxylon, Atropha pohliana, Dioclea, Spondias tuberosa, Zea mays, Schinopsis brasiliensis, and Agave flowers.Neto et al. 2012 =Breeding= Lear's macaw's rate of reproduction is one or two eggs per year during their mating season from December to May. However, not all pairs of birds mate often or at all. Juveniles reach sexual maturity around 2‚Äì4 years of age. Distribution and habitat For over a century after it had been described, the whereabouts of the wild population was unknown. It was eventually rediscovered in 1978 by ornithologist Helmut Sick in Bahia in the interior northeast of Brazil. Some thought the bird was a hybrid or variant involving the similar hyacinth macaw, but this idea was soon abandoned, as plumage, size, and proportions of Lear's macaw differ from those of its close relatives. It is known from two colonies at Toca Velha and Serra Branca, south of the Raso da Catarina plateau in northeast Bahia. In 1995, a roosting site holding 22 birds was located at Sento S√©/Campo Formoso, to the west.Munn 1995 Lear's macaw inhabits stands of licuri palm. This habitat, while never plentiful, is currently estimated to be around 1.6% of its original cover. Cattle that live near its nesting grounds often stand on the roots of young licuri palms, killing them, so causing a large loss of food for these birds. In fact, though the lifespan of these palms can be 30‚Äì150 years, most trees do not make it over 8‚Äì10 years. Lear's macaw also requires a sandstone cliff in which to nest. To nest there, they apply their saliva to the sandstone which softens it, then excavate small crevasses using their beaks and scrape the dust out of their soon-to-be nests with their feet. =Conservation status= In 1983, the global population was estimated to number just 60 birds.Yamashita 1987 Population in 2010 was estimated as between 1100 and 1200 individuals. It is currently listed as an endangered species (CITES I). As well as habitat loss, Lear's macaw has historically suffered from hunting and more recently trapping for the aviary trade. Various conservation organizations under ICMBio, along with local ranchers and other independent organizations, are working to help conserve the species. Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas created the Canudos Biological Station in 1993 to protect the sandstone cliffs used by the macaws to nest. Current Lear's macaw conservation projects are managed under the authority of Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. The Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Lear's Macaw advises the institute on the conservation of Lear's macaw. The committee includes Brazilian and international organizations and individuals. In 2009, the conservation status of the species was downgraded to endangered from critically endangered by the IUCN. This was prompted by an increase in the population, which based on annual 2009 counts at the Toca Velha and Serra Branca roosting sites is estimated to be 1000 individuals. uprightrightthumbIllustration by Edward Lear (1812‚Äì88) first published in his book Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots in 1832 Aviculture One of the earliest records (and one of very few at all) of a Lear's macaw in a public zoo was a dramatic display of \\"the four blues\\" including Lear's, glaucous, hyacinth, and Spix's macaws in 1900 at the Berlin Zoo.

Payraudeau, Retour sur la succession Shabaqo- Shabataqo, Nehet 1, 2014, p. 115-127 online here Shabaka's timeline The archaeological evidence now in 2016‚Äì2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman's GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka‚Äôs NLR #30‚Äôs Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand side of the lower edge of Shebitku‚Äôs NLR#33 Year 3 inscription.GPF Broekman, Genealogical considerations regarding the kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Egypt, GM 251 (2017), p.13 This can only mean that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku. Critically, Frederic Payraudeau writes in French that \\"the Divine Adoratrix or God's Wife of Amun Shepenupet I, the last Libyan Adoratrix, was still alive during the reign of Shebitku because she is represented performing rites and is described as \\"living\\" in those parts of the Osiris-H√©qadjet chapel built during his reign (wall and exterior of the gate)[45 ‚Äì G. Legrain, ‚ÄúLe temple et les chapelles d‚ÄôOsiris √† Karnak. Le temple d‚ÄôOsiris-Hiq-Djeto, partie √©thiopienne‚Äù, RecTrav 22 (1900) 128; JWIS III, 45.] In the rest of the room, it is Amenirdis I, Shabaka's sister), who is represented with the Adoratrix title and provided with a coronation name. The succession Shepenupet I - Amenirdis I as God's Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratrix thus took place during the reign of Shebitku. This detail in itself is sufficient to show that the reign of Shabaka cannot precede that of Shebitku.F. Payraudeau, pp.115-127 The construction of the tomb of Shebitku (Ku. 18) resembles that of Piye (Ku. 17) while that of Shabaka (Ku. 15) is similar to that of Taharqa (Nu. 1) and Tantamani (Ku. 16).[39 ‚Äì D. Dunham, El-Kurru, The Royal Cemeteries of Kush, I, (1950) 55, 60, 64, 67; also D. Dunham, Nuri, The Royal Cemeteries of Kush, II, (1955) 6-7; J. Lull, Las tumbas reales egipcias del Tercer Periodo Intermedio (dinast√≠as XXI- XXV). Tradici√≥n y cambios, BAR-IS 1045 (2002) 208.] This also favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession in the 25th dynasty. One of the strongest evidence that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku was demonstrated by the architectural features of the Kushite royal pyramids in El Kurru. Only in the pyramids of Piye (Ku 17) and Shebitku (Ku 18) are the burial-chambers open-cut structures with a corbelled roof, whereas fully tunnelled burial chamber substructures are found in the pyramids of Shabaka (Ku 15), Taharqa (Nu 1) and Tantamani (Ku 16), as well as with all subsequent royal pyramids in El Kurru and Nuri.Dows D. Dunham, El Kurru; The Royal Cemeteries of Kush (Cambridge, Massachusetts 1950) The fully tunnelled and once decorated burial chamber of Shabaka's pyramid was clearly an architectural improvement since it was followed by Taharqa and all his successors.G.P.F. Broekman, The order of succession between Shabaka and Shabataka. A different view on the chronology of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, GM 245, (2015), pp.21-22 The pyramid design evidence also shows that Shabaka must have ruled after‚Äîand not before‚ÄîShebitku. In the Cairo CG 42204 of the High Priest of Amun, Haremakhet‚Äîson of Shabaka‚Äîcalls himself as \\"king‚Äôs son of Shabaka, justified, who loves him, Sole Confidant of king Taharqa, justified, Director of the palace of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Tanutamun/Tantamani, may he live for ever.\\"G.P.F. Broekman, The order of succession between Shabaka and Shabataka. A different view on the chronology of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, GM 245, (2015), p.23 However, no mention of Haremakhet's service under Shebitku is made; even if Haremakhet was only a youth under Shebitku, this king's absence is strange since the intent of the statue's text was to render a chronological sequence of kings who reigned during Horemakhet's life, each of their names being accompanied by a reference to the relationship that existed between the king mentioned and Horemakhet.G.P.F. Broekman, GM 245 (2015), p.24 This implies that when Haremakhet was born, king Shebitku was already dead, which would favour a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Portrait of Shabaqa Payraudeau notes that Shebitku's shabtis are small (about 10 cm) and have a very brief inscription with only the king's birth name in a cartouche preceded by \\"the Osiris, king of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" and followed by m»ù ø-·∏´rw.[41 ‚Äì JWIS III, 51, number 9; D. Dunham, (see footnote 39), 69, plate 45A-B.]. They are thus very close to those of Piye/Piankhy [42 ‚Äì D. Dunham, (see footnote 39), plate 44.]. However, Shabaka's shabtis are larger (about 15‚Äì20 cm) with more developed inscriptions, including the quotation from the Book of the Dead, which is also present on those Taharqo, Tanouetamani and Senkamanisken.\\" All this evidence suggests that Shebitku ruled before Shabaka. Finally, Payraudeau observes that in the traditional Shebitku-Shabaka chronology, the time span between the reign of Taharqa and Shabaka seems to be excessively long. He notes that Papyrus Louvre E 3328c from Year 2 or Year 6 of Taharqa mentions the sale of a slave by his owner who had bought him in Year 7 of Shabaka, that is 27 years earlier in the traditional chronology but if the reign of Shabaka is placed just before that of Taharqa (with no intervening reign of Shebitku), there is a gap of about 10 years which is much more credible.Payraudeau, Nehet I, 2014, p.119 The German scholar Karl Jansen Winkeln also endorsed a Shebitku-Shabaka succession in a JEH 10 (2017) N.1 paper titled 'Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Dritten Zwischenzeit‚Äô, Journal of Egyptian History 10 (2017), pp. 23‚Äì42 when he wrote a postscript stating ‚ÄúIm Gegensatz zu meinen Ausf√ºhrungen auf dem [2014] Kolloquium in M√ºnster bin ich jetzt der Meinung, dass die (neue) Reihenfolge Schebitku‚ÄîSchabako in der Tat richtig ist...‚Äù or ‚ÄòIn contrast to my exposition at the [2014] Munster colloquium, I am now of the opinion that the (new) succession Shebitku-Shabako is in fact correct‚Ä¶‚ÄôJansen-Winkeln, Journal of Egyptian History 10 (2017), N.1, p.40 Family Shabaka is thought to be the son of King Kashta and Pebatjma, although a text from the time of Taharqa could be interpreted to mean that Shabaka was a brother of Taharqa and hence a son of Piye. Shabaka's Queen Consort was Qalhata, according to Assyrian records, a sister of Taharqa. Shabaka and Qalhata were the parents of King Tantamani and possibly the parents of King Shebitku as well, but this conflicts with evidence in favor of Shabaka ruling after Shebitku. It is possible that Queen Tabekenamun was a wife of Shabaka. She is thought by some to be a wife of Taharqa. Shabaka's son Haremakhet became High Priest of Amun and is known from a statue and a fragment of a statue found in Karnak. A lady named Mesbat is mentioned on the sarcophagus of Haremakhet and may be his mother.R. Morkot: The Black Pharaohs, Egypt's Nubian Rulers, London 2000, p. 205 Shabaka is the father of at least two more children, but the identity of their mother is not known. Piankharty later became the wife of her (half-)brother Tantamani. She is depicted on the Dream Stela with him. Isetemkheb H likely married Tantamani as well. She was buried in Abydos, Egypt. Biography Donation stela of Shabaka. Shabaka appears standing to the right, with the cartouche designating him. Shabaka succeeded his uncle Shebitku on the throne, and adopted the throne name of the Sixth Dynasty ruler Pepi II Neferkare. Shabaka's reign was initially dated from 716 BC to 702 BC by Kenneth Kitchen. However, new evidence indicates that Shebitku died around 705 BC because Sargon II (722‚Äì705 BC) of Assyria states in an official inscription at Tang-i Var (in Northwest Iran)‚Äîwhich is datable to 706 BC‚Äîthat it was Shebitku, Shabaka's predecessor, who extradited Iamanni of Ashdod to Shebitku as king of Egypt.G. Frame, The Inscription of Sargon II at Tang-i Var, Orientalia 68 (1999), pp. 31-57Dan'el Kahn, \\"The Inscription of Sargon II at Tang-i Var and the Chronology of Dynasty 25,\\" Orientalia 70 (2001), pp. 1‚Äì3 This view has been accepted by many Egyptologists today such as Aidan Dodson,Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 88 (2002) p.182 Rolf Krauss, David Aston, and Karl Jansen-WinkelnKarl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"The Third Intermediate Period\\" in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill, 2006. pp. 258‚Äì259 among others because there is no concrete evidence for coregencies or internal political/regional divisions in the Nubian kingdom during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. This point was also stressed by Dan'el Kahn in a 2006 article.Kahn, Dan'el., Divided Kingdom, Co-regency, or Sole Rule in the Kingdom(s) of Egypt- and-Kush?, Egypt and Levant 16 (2006), pp. 275‚Äì291 online PDF All contemporary records suggest that the Nubian Pharaohs ruled Egypt with only a single king on the throne, while Taharqa states explicitly on one of his Kawa steles that he assumed power only after the death of his brother, Shebitku.Kawa Stela V, line 15 Shabaka's reign is significant because he consolidated the Nubian Kingdom's control over all of Egypt from Nubia down to the Delta region. It also saw an enormous amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In Karnak he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the twin crowns of Egypt. Shabaka succeeded in preserving Egypt's independence from outside foreign powers‚Äîespecially the Neo-Assyrian Empire of Sargon II. The most famous relic from Shabaka's reign is the Shabaka Stone which records several Old Kingdom documents that the king ordered preserved.Shabaka stone Also notable is the Shabaka Gate, a large stone door unearthed by archeologists in 2011 and believed to have guarded the room where the king's treasures were stored. Despite being relative newcomers to Egypt, Shabaka and his family were immensely interested in Egypt's past and the art of the period reflects their tastes which harked back to earlier periods. Shabaka would grant refuge to king Iamanni of Ashdod after the latter fled to Egypt following the suppression of his revolt by Assyria in 712 BC. Death Shabaka is assumed to have died in his 15th regnal year based on BM cube statue 24429, which is dated to Year 15, II Shemu day 11 of Shabaka's reign.Kitchen, Kenneth A. (1996).The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100‚Äì650 BC), 3rd edition (Warminster: Aris & Phillips), pp. 153-54 Shabaka was buried in a pyramid at el-Kurru and was succeeded by his nephew Taharqa.

Saraceno is most often recognized from his time playing with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker (Cream) as well as his brief tenure with the rock band Poison. Saraceno's early success in the music industry would eventually blossom into a career in producing and composing for television and film. Early life and career Blues Saraceno was born to musician parents, who introduced him at an early age to several musical instruments. He started to play guitar at the age of nine. When he was thirteen, he broke his elbow when he fell from a go-kart and asked the doctor to position the cast in a way that allowed him to remove it from his sling to practice guitar during his recovery. When he was nineteen, Saraceno moved to Los Angeles to seek a career in music. Career When Saraceno was still a teenager, his manager sent a demo tape to singer Michael Bolton, who decided to enlist him to play on a song for Cher's album, Heart of Stone. The album also featured musicians like Peter Cetera, Bonnie Tyler, Desmond Child, and others. His demo tape then reached the Guitar for the Practicing Musician magazine. The magazine, which was about to launch a new record label, offered Saraceno a record deal. Saraceno released his first album titled Never Look Back in 1989. Saraceno won an audition with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, former members of Cream, and started touring with them. After two successful US tours, Saraceno was sometimes referred to as the \\"kid that replaced Eric Clapton\\". After another year of overseas touring, Baker departed and was replaced by Simon Phillips (Who, Toto) and eventually Gary Husband (Level 42). Saraceno released two other solo albums (Plaid and Hairpick) as well as furthering his reputation as a top call session guitarist and landing many high-profile equipment endorsements. In 1993, Saraceno joined the band Poison as lead guitarist and songwriter after Richie Kotzen was fired. After a South American tour which included the famous Hollywood rock festival in Brazil, Saraceno recorded the album Crack a Smile with the band. However, Capitol Records decided to shelve the album, releasing the 1996 compilation album, Poison's Greatest Hits: 1986‚Äì1996, instead. Still, the album featured two of the new songs recorded with Saraceno. After some time, Saraceno left the group amicably and was replaced by one of the band's former guitarists, C.C. DeVille. In 2000, Capitol finally decided to release the Crack a Smile album under the name Crack a Smile... and More!. The album features fifteen tracks recorded by Saraceno. After his departure from Poison, Saraceno met the Vice-President of Advertising of Fox Television, who was a fan of Saraceno's earlier instrumental work. This resulted in Saraceno working on soundtracks and songs for several television shows and films. In 2000, Saraceno founded the band, Transmission OK. Saraceno also worked as record producer for the band, which was signed to Beyond Records, and was distributed by BMG. After a brief US tour, and lackluster support from the label, the group disbanded and Saraceno continued to work on television and film, as well as his session work. Saraceno's has done session work with everyone from Ziggy Marley (Dragonfly) to Melissa Etheridge (Lucky), earning him a reputation for being a \\"go-to guy\\" for many of Los Angeles' top record producers and engineers. Saraceno has also produced for artists including Scott Caan (Hawaii Five-0, Oceans 11), Eric Balfour (24, Haven, Chainsaw Massacre) of Fredalba, Lindsay Price (Beverly Hills 90210, Lipstick Jungle) and Anthony Michael Hall (Dead Zone). Saraceno's greatest success has come in the field of television and film. His television work credits include WWE, CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, Disney, Discovery, UPN, MTV, MTV 2, VH1, USA, TLC, Comedy Central, Telemundo, SCI FI, SPIKE, E! and BRAVO. A more detailed list can be found on his website (www.bluessaraceno.com). He has commented on how it is not uncommon to have several commercials running in different countries throughout the world, all at the same time, using the same piece of music. Saraceno did three tracks for Megas XLR. These tracks were Blood Shot, Berzerker and Ro-Sham-Bo. Saraceno's \\"Save My Soul\\" is the soundtrack for the History Channel's mini-series The Men Who Built America. Saraceno's \\"Evil Ways\\" song was also used in various videogames trailers such as God of War: Ascension, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, BioShock Infinite and Call of Duty: Black Ops II's zombies mode map, Mob of the Dead and was also included in the soundtrack for a videogame Rebel Galaxy. In addition, the song was also utilized to promote AMC's 2013 Fear Fest and is also used as the main theme music in the History Channel's TV series, Biker Battleground Phoenix. TNA wrestler AJ Styles began using \\"Evil Ways\\" at TNA's Slammiversary pay-per- view on June 2, 2013 as his new theme song. It was also used in a WWE promo featuring The Undertaker vs. CM Punk WrestleMania XXIX match and another promo featuring The Wyatt Family in an episode of WWE SmackDown. It was also used during a promo for Kane, Ryback and Big Show vs. The Wyatt Family at WWE's Fastlane 2016 pay-per-view. German TV-Channel ProSieben and sister-channel ProSieben Maxx are using the song for almost every promo-clip for upcoming western-movies in their program. \\"Flesh It Out\\" was used as WWE rookie Seth Rollins' theme tune for the first year of his career on FCW and NXT. \\"Strident Missile\\" was used for Triple H's history of dominance promo for WrestleMania XXX. An instrumental version of the dubstep remix of \\"The River\\" was used for Emma's video packages leading up to her return at the post-Wrestlemania RAW in 2017. WWE also used his single \\"Bad Man\\" for Jeff Jarrett's Hall of Fame video.

It is designed to assist a project manager in developing a schedule, assigning resources to tasks, tracking progress, managing the budget, and analyzing workloads. Microsoft Project was the company's third Microsoft Windows-based application. Within a few years after its launch, it became the dominant PC-based project management software. It is part of the Microsoft Office family but has never been included in any of the Office suites. It is available currently in two editions, Standard and Professional. Microsoft Project's proprietary file format is .mpp. Microsoft Project and Microsoft Project Server are the cornerstones of the Microsoft Office enterprise project management (EPM) product.  History  Microsoft Project 2000 'Project' was an MS-DOS software application originally written in Microsoft 'C' (and some assembly) language for the IBM PC. The idea originated from the vision of Ron Bredehoeft, a former IBM S/E and PC-enthusiast in the early 1980s, to express the recipe and all preparation for a breakfast of eggs Benedict in project management terms. Mr. Bredehoeft formed Microsoft Application Services (MAS) during the birth of the application and the company later entered an OEM agreement with Microsoft Corporation. Alan M. Boyd, Microsoft's Manager of Product Development, introduced the application as an internal tool to help manage the huge number of software projects that were in development at any time inside the company. Boyd wrote the specification and engaged a local Seattle company to develop the prototype. The first commercial version of Project was released for DOS in 1984. Microsoft bought all rights to the software in 1985 and released version 2. Version 3 for DOS was released in 1986. Version 4 for DOS was the final DOS version, released in 1986. The first Windows version was released in 1990, and was labelled version 1 for Windows. In 1991 a Macintosh version was released. Development continued until Microsoft Project 4.0 for Mac in 1993. Microsoft Project 4 for the Mac included both 68k and PowerMac versions, Visual Basic for Applications and integration with Microsoft office 4.2 for the Mac. In 1994, Microsoft stopped development of most of its Mac applications and did not offer a new version of Office until 1998, after the creation of the new Microsoft Macintosh Business Unit the year prior. The Mac Business Unit never released an updated version of Project, and the last version does not run natively on Mac OS X. Microsoft Project 1.0 was the only version to support Windows 2.x. It came bundled with Windows 2.x runtime but was fully compatible with Windows 3.0, especially Standard and Enhanced modes. The setup program runs in DOS, like the most Windows-based applications at the time. Microsoft Project 3.0 introduced macro support, toolbars, print preview, DDE and OLE support, spell checking, Resource Allocation view and Planning Wizards and was the last to support Windows 3.0. The setup program now runs in Windows, and it is based on Microsoft's own setup program, which was also used by e.g. Microsoft Visual Basic 2.0/3.0, Works 2.0, Access 1.x. Microsoft Project 4.0 was the first to use common Office menus, right-click context menus, Acme setup program and the last to support Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5. It was the last 16-bit version. Additionally it was the first version to use VBA macro language and introduced screen tooltips, Cue Cards, GanttChartWizard, Calendar view, Assign Resources dialog, recurring tasks, workgroup abilities, Drawing toolbar, Microsoft Project Exchange file format support, OLE 2.0 and ability to create reports. This version allowed user to consolidate up to 80 projects. Microsoft Project 95 (4.1) was the first 32-bit version and it was designed for Windows 95, hence the name even though some components such as the welcome tour, help components etc remained 16-bit. It introduced ODBC support, AutoCorrect, Answer Wizard, like all Office 95 applications. Updated version, called Microsoft Project 4.1a improved Windows NT support. Additionally it was the first version to be available on CD-ROM. Additionally it was the last version to open Project 3.0 files. Microsoft Project 98 was fully 32-bit, and the first to use Tahoma font in the menu bars, to contain Office Assistant, like all Office 97 applications, introduced view bar, AutoFilter, task splitting, Assignment Information dialog, resource availability dates, project status date, user-entered actual costs, new task types, multiple critical paths, in- sheet controls, ability to rename custom fields, Web publishing features, new database format, Task Usage, Tracking Gantt and Resource Usage views, Web features, Web toolbar, PERT analysis features, resource contouring, cost rate tables, effort-driven scheduling, cross-project linking, indicators, progress lines, ability to save project files in HTML format, ability to analyze time- scaled data in Excel, improved limits for the number of tasks, resources, outline levels etc., IntelliMouse and Microsoft Office Binder support, Microsoft Outlook timeline integration, selective data import and export, ability to save as Microsoft Excel pivot tables, Microsoft Project Map, Project menu and allowed user to consolidate 1,000 projects. It was the last version to run on Windows NT 3.51, the last to open Project 4.0/95 files and save in .mpx (Microsoft Project Exchange) file format, the last to use Acme setup program and the last to be available on floppy disks. Project 98 SR-1 was a major service release addressing several issues in Project 98. Microsoft Project 2000 was the first to use personalized menus, Microsoft Agent-based Office Assistant and to use Windows Installer-based setup interface, like all Office 2000 applications, and introduced Microsoft Project Central (later renamed Microsoft Project Server). PERT Chart was renamed Network Diagram and was greatly improved in this version. Notable new features include ability to create personal Gantt charts, ability to apply filters in Network Diagram view, AutoSave, task calendars, ability to create projects based on templates and to specify default save path and format, graphical indicators, material resources, deadline dates, OLE DB, grouping, outline codes, estimated durations, month duration, value lists and formulas custom fields, contoured resource availability, ability to clear baseline, variable row height, in-cell editing, fill handle, ability to set fiscal year in timescale, single document interface, accessibility features, COM add-ins, pluggable language user interface, roaming user and Terminal Services support, ability to set task and project priority up to 1,000 (previously 10) and HTML help. Project 2000 was also the last version to support Find Fast (available in Windows 9x and NT 4.0 only) and to run on Windows 95. Project 2000 SR-1 fixed several bugs. Microsoft Project 2002 was the first to contain task panes, safe mode, smart tags, import/setup tracking/new project/calendar/import and export mapping wizards, ability to import tasks from Outlook and to save multiple baselines along with additional baseline fields, Project Guide, EPM/portfolio features (Professional only), Excel task list template, rollup baseline data to summary tasks on a selective baseline save, ability to choose which baseline the earned value calculations are based on, calculation options, multiple project manager support (Project Server is required), Collaborate menu, \\"Type a question for help\\" in the top right corner, error reporting along with mandatory product activation, like Office XP and Windows XP and ability to open and save Microsoft Project Data Interchange (.mspdi) files. It was also the last version to run on Windows NT 4.0, 98 (SE) and ME. It was available in two editions for the first time, Standard and Professional. Office Assistant is installed but not enabled by default. Support for accounts with limited rights under Windows 2000/XP was improved. Find Fast was dropped in favor of Windows 2000/XP Indexing Service. Microsoft Project 2003 was the first to support Windows XP visual styles and to contain SharePoint support, XML importing/printing/Copy Picture to Office wizards, built-in Office Online help, ability to create WBS charts in Visio, add-in for comparing projects (available as a freely downloadable add-on for Project 2000 and 2002), resource availability graphs, ability to import resource information from Active Directory and Exchange address book, Windows XP-style icons, like all Office 2003 applications, and the last to contain Office Assistant (not installed by default) and to run on Windows 2000 (Service Pack 3 required). Microsoft Project 2007 was the last to contain the menu bar and toolbars. New features include top level budget planning, multiple level undo, ability to manage non-working time, background cell highlighting, cost/team resources, change highlighting, visual reports, desktop OLAP cube and Report menu. Office Assistant was removed entirely. Microsoft Project 2010 was the first to contain ribbon and Backstage view, like all Office 2010 applications, contextual guidance, ability to zoom in/out quickly, user-controlled scheduling, top down summary tasks, placeholder text in project fields, timeline view, ability to add columns dynamically, text wrap, expanded color palette and formatting, task inspector, schedule warnings, ability to save as PDF or XPS and to synchronize with SharePoint, enhanced copy/pase and the last to open Microsoft Project 98 and .mpx files and to run on Windows XP and Vista. Additionally it was the first 64-bit version. Volume licensing activation was introduced in this version. Microsoft Project 2013 was the first to contain Modern UI-based look, and introduced Microsoft account and OneDrive integration. New features include integrated communication (Skype for Business is required). Microsoft Project 2016 is the last to support Windows 7 and Windows 8(.1). New features include multiple timeline view, Tell Me, colorful/dark gray/white themes, resource engagements, resource manager views, resource capacity heat maps, ability to give feedback directly to Microsoft in the File tab. Microsoft Project 2019 runs only on Windows 10, and it contains features carried over from Office 365. New features include ability to link tasks using a drop-down menu, Task Summary Name field, timeline bar labels and task progress, accessibility improvements. Versions for Windows were released in 1990 (v1.0), 1992 (v3.0), 1993 (v4.0), 1995 (Project 95, v4.1a), Project 98 (v8.0), Project 98 SR-1 (1999), Project 2000 (v9.0), Project 2000 SR-1 (2001), Project 2002 (v10.0), Project 2003 (v11.0), Project 2007 (v12.0), Project 2010 (v14.0), Project 2013 (v15.0) and Project 2016 (v16.0). There was no Version 2 on the Windows platform; the original design spec was augmented with the addition of macro capabilities and the extra work required to support a macro language pushed the development schedule out to early 1992 (Version 3).  Features  Microsoft Project 2007 showing a simple Gantt chart Project creates budgets based on assignment work and resource rates. As resources are assigned to tasks and assignment work estimated, the program calculates the cost, equal to the work times the rate, which rolls up to the task level and then to any summary tasks and finally to the project level. Resource definitions (people, equipment and materials) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool. Each resource can have its own calendar, which defines what days and shifts a resource is available. Resource rates are used to calculate resource assignment costs which are rolled up and summarized at the resource level. Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources, and the application schedules task work based on the resource availability as defined in the resource calendars. All resources can be defined in label without limit. Therefore, it cannot determine how many finished products can be produced with a given amount of raw materials. This makes Microsoft Project unsuitable for solving problems of available materials constrained production. Additional software is necessary to manage a complex facility that produces physical goods. The application creates critical path schedules, and critical chain and event chain methodology third-party add-ons also are available. Schedules can be resource leveled, and chains are visualized in a Gantt chart. Additionally, Microsoft Project can recognize different classes of users. These different classes of users can have differing access levels to projects, views, and other data. Custom objects such as calendars, views, tables, filters, and fields are stored in an enterprise global which is shared by all users. = Editions = Project is available in two editions, Standard and Professional; both editions are available either as 32 or 64bit options. The Professional edition includes all the features of the Standard version, plus more features like team collaboration tools and ability to connect to Microsoft Project Server. =Project 2010= Microsoft Project 2010 includes the Fluent user interface known as the Ribbon. ;Interoperability: Microsoft Project's capabilities were extended with the introduction of Microsoft Office Project Server and Microsoft Project Web Access. Project Server stores Project data in a central SQL-based database, allowing multiple, independent projects to access a shared resource pool. Web Access allows authorized users to access a Project Server database across the Internet, and includes timesheets, graphical analysis of resource workloads, and administrative tools. ;User controlled scheduling: User-controlled scheduling offers flexible choices for developing and managing projects. ;Timeline: The timeline view allows the user to build a basic Visio-style graphical overview of the project schedule. The view can be copied and pasted into PowerPoint, Word, or any other application. ;SharePoint 2010 list synchronization: SharePoint Foundation and Project Professional project task status updates may be synchronized for team members. ;Inactive tasks: helps experiment with project plans and perform what-if analysis ;The Team Planner view: The new Team Planner shows resources and work over time, and helps spot problems and resolve issues. =Project 2013= What's new in Project 2013 includes new Reports section, better integration with other Microsoft products, and appearance of user interface items: ; Reports: A Reports section is added to the ribbon for pre-installed reports. Project 2013 includes graphical reports so that you can create graphical reports and add clipart without having to export data to another program. For example, the Burndown reports show planned work, completed work, and remaining work as lines on a graph. Project 2013 adds pre-installed ability to compare projects, do dashboards, and to export to Visual Reports. ; Trace task paths: This feature allows you to highlight the link chain (or 'task path') for any task. When you click on a specific task, all of its predecessor tasks show up in one color and all of its successor tasks show up in another color. ; Sharing: Project 2013 improves the sharing and communication features of its predecessors in multiple ways without leaving Project. With Lync installed, hovering over a name allows you to start an IM session, a video chat, an email, or a phone call. You can copy and paste content to any of the Microsoft Office suite. You can sync content to Sharepoint or a SkyDrive to share without going through Project and Project Online provides an online project management web app that has all of the functionality of Project 2013 and can be accessed from any web enabled device. =Project 2016= Project 2016 adds a new Reports section, backwards-compatibility with Project Server 2013, better integration with other Microsoft products, and improved appearance of user interface items: ; Timeline: Allows user to customize views to have multiple timeline bars and custom date ranges in a single view. ; Resource Agreements: Gives features for resource planning coordination between Project Manager and Resource Manager. ; Office 2016 style theme and help: Uses the new Office query 'tell me what you want to do'. ; Backwards compatibility with Microsoft Project Server 2013: The transition of enterprises from one version to the next may be eased by this product being able to interact with the earlier version of server.

General Jos√© Antonio de la Caridad Maceo y Grajales (June 14, 1845December 7, 1896) was second-in-command of the Cuban Army of Independence. Fellow Cubans gave Maceo the nickname ‚ÄúThe Bronze Titan\\" (), nickname that he earned after being wounded several times in battle. Spaniards referred to Maceo as the \\"Greater Lion\\" (El Le√≥n mayor). Maceo was one of the most noteworthy guerrilla leaders in 19th century Latin America, comparable to Jos√© Antonio P√°ez of Venezuela in military acumen. Early years Maceo was the son of a Venezuelan farmer and dealer in agricultural products, Marcos Maceo, and an Afro-Cuban woman of Dominican descent, Mariana Grajales y Cuello. His father when still a young man, fought for the Spanish against the forces for independence led by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and others. In 1823, he moved from Caracas, Venezuela, to Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, after some of his comrades were exiled from South America. Maceo was born June 14, 1845, in the town of San Luis, in the Oriente Province outside Santiago de Cuba, in a farm known to locals as Jobabo. Although his father taught him skills in the use of arms and management of their small properties, it was his mother, Mariana Grajales, who inculcated in him a sense of order. This maternal discipline would be important in the development of Maceo's character and would be reflected later in his acts as a military leader. At the age of sixteen, Maceo went to work for his father, delivering products and supplies by mule. He was a successful entrepreneur and farmer. As the oldest of the children, he inherited his father's leadership qualities and later would become a decorated general. Maceo developed an active interest in the political issues of his time and was initiated in the mysteries of Freemasonry. The Cuban Freemasonry movement was influenced by the principles of the French Revolution - \\"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\\" - as well as the Masons' main guidelines: God, Reason, Virtue. Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì78) Approximately two weeks after the October 10, 1868, revolt led by Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes against Spain known as \\"The Cry of Yara\\" (\\"El Grito de Yara\\"), Maceo, together with his father and brothers joined the war. Mariana Grajales, followed her family members into the manigua (the woods and most thick countryside) in order to support the Mambises, as Cuban rebels were known in the 19th century. The Maceos enlisted as privates when the Ten Years' War began. Within five months, Antonio Maceo was promoted to commander (or major), and within a matter of weeks after that he was again promoted to lieutenant colonel. A promotion to colonel followed, and five years later he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general because of his bravery and ability to outmaneuver the Spanish Army. Maceo participated in more than 500 battles. However, the humble origin of Maceo and the colour of his skin delayed his raising to the rank of major general, due principally to the racist and class exclusiveness tendencies of several other patriots of an aristocratic or bourgeois origin. Men under Maceo's command began to call him ‚ÄúThe Bronze Titan‚Äù, because of his exceptional physical strength and resistance to bullet or blade injuries. He recovered from more than 25 war injuries over the course of some 500 military battles, and none of Maceo's wounds diminished his willingness to lead his troops into combat. He had special recognition and admiration, as chief and war teacher, of the great Dominican strategist M√°ximo G√≥mez, who would become, in the years to come, the General-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberator Army. The use of the machete as a war weapon by G√≥mez as a substitute for the Spanish sword (also due to the scarcity of firearms and ammunition) was rapidly adopted by Maceo and his troops. Antonio Maceo rejected the military seditions of Lagunas de Varona and Santa Rita, which undermined the independence troops' unity and favoured a regionalism in Las Villas. This stood in contrast with the style of leadership exhibited by Vicente Garcia Gonz√°lez, who eschewed front line heroics in favor of planning from behind the lines, and who also advocated a regional approach to secession. Divisionism and the imprecise designs of Garc√≠a were plainly rejected by Maceo when the former asked for support to constitute a ‚ÄúNew Revolutionary Government‚Äù. Divisions, regionalism, and indiscipline were the main reasons for the decline of the Revolution, of which the Spanish General Arsenio Mart√≠nez-Campos y Ant√≥n, then already named Captain General of Cuba, drew considerable advantage. An officer of honour, he offered peace guarantees, amnesty for revolutionary men and legal reforms, in exchange for a cease of hostilities, which had already lasted 10 years (in 1878). At the same time, the Spanish Government continued the concentration of more forces to enclose the diminishing Cuban rebel forces. Antonio Maceo was one of the officers who opposed the signing of the Pact of Zanj√≥n, which ended the Ten Years' War. He and other Mambises (independence soldiers) met with General Mart√≠nez-Campos on March 15, 1878, to discuss the peace terms, but Maceo argued that no peace could be achieved if none of the objectives of the war had been accomplished; chief among these aims was the abolition of slavery in Cuba and Cuban independence. The only immediate benefit was amnesty for those involved in the conflict and liberty for the black soldiers who had fought in the \\"Liberator Army.\\" Maceo did not recognize the treaty as valid and did not adhere to the proposed amnesty. This meeting, known as the Protest of Baragu√°, began when a messenger was sent to Maceo from another Cuban high-ranking officer, who proposed an ambush against the Spanish general. Maceo rejected the plan, informing the would-be conspirator via letter: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want victory if it goes accompanied with dishonor.‚Äù After respecting the truce time for the interview (a few days), Maceo resumed hostilities. In order to save his life, the government of the Republic of Cuba gave him the task of gathering money, arms and men for an expedition from the exterior. Maceo's movements were useless, however, due to the dismay of the exiled sympathizers who were unhappy with the Zanj√≥n pact. Later in 1879, Maceo and Major General Calixto Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez planned from New York a new invasion to Cuba, which initiated the short-lived Little War. Maceo did not personally fight in these battles, for he had sent Calixto Garc√≠a as highest commander. This avoided exacerbating the racist prejudices of fellow Cuban officers that were inflamed by Spanish propaganda. The Spanish tried to create the impression that Maceo was trying to start a racial war against white Cubans, though their propaganda efforts did little damage to Maceo's reputation. The Fruitful Truce (1879-1895) After a short stay in Haiti, where he was pursued by the Spanish and faced assassination attempts by the Spanish consulates, and also in Jamaica, Maceo eventually settled in the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste. The president of Costa Rica assigned Maceo to a military unit and provided him with a small farm to live on. Maceo was contacted by Jos√© Mart√≠ and urged to initiate the War of 1895, called by Mart√≠ the ‚Äúnecessary war‚Äù. Maceo, with the experience and wisdom gained from previous revolutionary failures, argued that there were a number of impediments to military success in a brief but intense epistolary exchange with Mart√≠, warning about the causes of the partial defeat in the Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì78). Mart√≠ responded with his formula of ‚Äúthe army, free; but the country, as a country with all its dignity represented,‚Äù and convinced Maceo of the high probabilities of success if the war was to be prepared carefully. As a precondition, Maceo demanded that highest command should be in the hands of G√≥mez, which was approved without reservation by the Delegate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Mart√≠). In Costa Rica, he faced, gun in hand, another attempt of assassination by Spanish agents at the exit of a theatre, with fatal result for one of the aggressors. Cuban War of Independence Maceo in uniform In 1895, together with Flor Crombet and other lesser officers, Maceo disembarked in the vicinity of Baracoa (close to the eastern tip of Cuba) and after repelling a Spanish attempt at capturing or killing him, he got into the mountains of that region. After many difficulties, he managed to gather a small contingent of armed men, which rapidly grew with other rebel groups of the Santiago de Cuba region. In the farm of \\"La Mejorana\\", Maceo had a historic, but unfortunate, meeting with G√≥mez and Mart√≠, because of the disagreements between him and Mart√≠, regarding the question of the relationship between the military movements and the civilian government, against which constitution was Maceo, but Mart√≠, knowing both sides of the problem, stood on his formula. Several days later, Mart√≠, treated as a non-military ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù by Maceo, would fall in battle in Dos R√≠os (confluence between the rivers Contramaestre and Cauto). After G√≥mez was designated General in Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army, Maceo was named Lieutenant General (second in command after the General in Chief). Starting from Mangos de Baragu√° (place of the historical protest in front of Mart√≠nez- Campos), Maceo and G√≥mez, on command of two long mambises columns, took brilliantly the task of invading the west of Cuba, riding or walking more than 1000 miles in 96 days. After several months bleeding the Spanish forces in Havana and Pinar del R√≠o Maceo arrived at Mantua, in the western extreme of Cuba, in October 1896, after defeating for many times the technically and numerically superior forces of the Spaniards (five times the Cuban forces on occasions). Using alternately the tactics of guerrilla and open warfare, they exhausted the Spanish Army of more than a quarter million soldiers and traversed all the island, even through the military trails, walls and fences built by the Spanish Army with the purpose of stopping them and dealing with an overwhelming technical and numerical superiority of the Spaniards. The level of coordination and cohesiveness of Cuban forces was driven by the fact that M√°ximo G√≥mez had clearly established a chain of command that subordinated all Major Generals to Maceo, his executive officer. The invasion of Western Cuba had been previously attempted by Brigadier General Henry Reeve during the Ten Years' War but faltered (and collapsed) between the easternmost section of the province of Matanzas and the westernmost section of the province of Havana and Reeve perished. At the time Maceo had collaborated with Reeve under the direction of M√°ximo G√≥mez. The eagerness for independence and the cruelty of the Spanish high officers made rural inhabitants of the western half of the island eager to give support in men and logistics to the Liberation Army. This was the cause of the institution, by Valeriano Weyler, of the reconcentration. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were forcibly carried to the cities, mainly Havana, Pinar del R√≠o and Matanzas, besides several minor cities in these three provinces. In the concentration camps created for them, very similar to those later built in Europe by the Nazis, almost a third part of the Cuban rural population lost their lives. Contrary to the expectations of Weyler, the cruel reconcentration encouraged many people to join to the Liberation army, preferring to die in battle than in starvation. In 1896, after meeting G√≥mez in Havana (crossing once more the trail from Mariel to Majana via Mariel Bay), he returned to the fields of Pinar del R√≠o, where he faced bloody clashes with outnumbering forces, led by Spanish generals famous for their victories in Africa and the Philippines, and provided with artillery and the most modern weapons for infantry including the Mauser bolt-action rifle. After decimating Spanish forces in the westernmost mountains of Cuba, Maceo turned eastward again, crossing the mentioned trail in order to travel to Las Villas or Camag√ºey. There he was planning to meet G√≥mez to plan the ulterior course of war, and with the Government in Arms, to establish an agreement between it and the forces in action, in relation with two main subjects: the raisings of medium and high officers in the Liberation Army and the recognition of belligerence by foreign countries and acceptation of direct military aid. His position was, at that time, acquiescent with accepting economic aid and packages with weapons and ammunitions from Europe or even from the United States, but was strongly opposed to acceptance by Cubans in the independence movement for a direct military intervention by the US in Cuba. Death Death of Maceo in 1896 His plans for meeting with G√≥mez and the Government in Arms never took place. On December 7, 1896, in the vicinity of Punta Brava, Maceo was advancing into the farm of San Pedro, accompanied only by his personal escort (two or three men), the physician of his Headquarters (who sold their position to the Spanish Colonel Francisco Cirugeda), Brigade General Jos√© Mir√≥ Argenter, and a small troop of no more than twenty men. When they attempted to cut a fence for facilitating the march of horses through those lands, they were detected by a strong Spanish column, which opened an intense fire. Maceo was hit by two shots, one in the chest and another that broke his jaw and penetrated his skull. His companions could not carry him because of the intensity of the firefight and Maceo's size. The only rebel who stayed by him was his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Francisco G√≥mez Toro (known as Panchito), son of M√°ximo G√≥mez, who faced the Spanish column for the sole purpose of protecting the body of his general. After being shot several times, the Spaniards killed G√≥mez with machete strikes, leaving both bodies abandoned, not knowing the identity of the fallen. The corpses of Maceo and Panchito were picked up the next day by Colonel Aranguren, from Havana, who ran immediately to the battle scene after hearing the news. They were later buried in secret in the farm of two brothers who swore to keep the burial place in secrecy until Cuba would be free and independent and the correspondent military honors could be given to the hero. Nowadays, the remains of Antonio Maceo y Grajales and Francisco G√≥mez Toro lie in the Monumento El Cacahual south of Havana, close to the limits of the former farm of San Pedro, and the site is one of pilgrimage by Cuban people. Scholars say that Maceo's death was as traumatic to Cuban patriots as Mart√≠'s. Legacy Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital in Havana, with a monument to Maceo to the left In addition to his role as a soldier and statesman in the Cuban movement for independence, Maceo was an influential political strategist and military planner, and Jos√© Mart√≠ is among Cuban leaders who were inspired by Maceo. Being a member of masonry, in his correspondence one can read more than once his credo base on \\"God, Reason and Virtue\\". He was quoted as having a strict motto: \\"My duties to country and to my own political convictions are above all human effort; with these I shall reach the pedestal of freedom or I shall perish fighting for my country's redemption.\\" (November 3, 1890). Mart√≠, speaking about him, said that \\"Maceo has as much strength in his mind as in his arm.\\" Antonio Maceo Monument in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba Of democratic political adherence, he expressed many times his sympathy for the republican form of government, but insisted on seeking for the formula of \\"liberty; equality and fraternity\\", recalling the well-known but almost never applied principles of the French Revolution and defining a policy on the search for social justice. Being in a dinner meeting in a very short visit made to Santiago de Cuba during the Fruitful Truce, he was invited to make a toast and a phrase was said by a young man for a wish to annex Cuba to the United States and turn Cuba into \\"...another star into the constellation of the United States...\\". His answer was: I think, young man, that this would be the only occasion in which I would place my sword at the same side with the Spanish ones.\\" And foreseeing the growth of North American expansionism, (he was absolutely convinced of the inevitable victory of Cuban Arms), he expressed in a letter to a friend of arms: \\"That (country) which attempts to seize Cuba, will gather the dust of its ground soaked in blood, if he does not perish in fight.\\" =Monuments= Monuments to Maceo include those in Santiago de Cuba and another in Havana, between the Malec√≥n and the front of the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital in Centro Habana.

Played by Rainbow Sun Francks, Aiden Ford is introduced as a main character in the season one premiere \\"Rising\\", holding the military rank of first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Ford is a regular in season one. He appears in a recurring role season two and appears once in a dream sequence in the season five premiere episode Search and Rescue. He later reappears in the official continuation novel Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path in which his ultimate fate is revealed. Television Lieutenant Aiden Ford is introduced in the series premiere, \\"Rising\\", where he is stationed at the Antarctica outpost. Ford served in the Stargate Command (SGC) before and is twenty-five years old at the beginning of the first season. ‚Äî Sheppard: \\"Ford? How old are you?\\" ‚Äî Ford: \\"Twenty five, sir.\\" Ford served as John Sheppard's second-in-command after the events of \\"Rising\\" until a Wraith feeds upon Ford during a Wraith attack on Atlantis in season 2's \\"The Siege, Part 3\\". An exploding grenade blows them off a building into the ocean, and Ford's unconscious body and the still attached Wraith are recovered over an hour later. Ford survives after having an overdose of Wraith enzyme and later undergoes mental and physical changes. Ford develops a solid black left eye and becomes more aggressive and paranoid, fleeing Atlantis with a stolen Puddle Jumper. Physical changes in Ford induced by the Wraith attack. The Atlantis team encounters him again in \\"Runner\\" where they learn that Ford began killing Wraiths throughout the Pegasus galaxy to harvest their enzyme that gave him abnormal strength. Ford is presumed dead when he deliberately jumps into the culling beam of a Wraith dart, but the Atlantis team encounters him again in the mid-season 2-parter \\"The Lost Boys\\"/\\"The Hive\\". The Wraith-enzyme allowed Ford to awake immediately after rematerializing on board a Wraith-hive ship, from where he escaped only to build up a small strike force of young men following his suit by informing them about the benefits of the Wraith-enzyme. Ford asks the Atlantis team for help in destroying an entire Wraith Hive-ship, but the mission fails and forces Sheppard to leave Ford behind on an about-to-explode hive ship. Ford is only seen again in Sheppard's dream in the season 5 episode \\"Search and Rescue\\". ‚Äî Ford: \\"You don't remember rescuing her [Teyla] because you didn't. Just like you never rescued me.\\" ‚Äî Sheppard: \\"I have had a chance to rescue a team mate before, and it slipped through my hands. I am not letting that happen again.\\" Literature Ford reappears in the official novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and with a group of nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents. Conceptual history Rainbow Sun Francks at Wolf Pegasus One, London, 2006 After the end of season 1, the series producers, and the actor himself, felt that Ford had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write him out, the writers came up with an idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to a recurring character. Producer Joseph Mallozzi said in 2009 that \\"We can assume [Ford] went down [...] with the ship\\" in \\"The Hive\\". Rainbow Sun Francks was disappointed about the evolution of his character, saying Ford did not evolve a backstory which the other characters did. Although Francks called the situation \\"tough\\", he reacted positively towards the development of character during the second season. After announcing that Ronon Dex would become a main character in the Atlantis series, they followed up with another announcement saying that they had reduced Ford to a recurring character in the series. Many fans were disappointed with this new development because many felt he didn't have time to \\"prove\\" himself in the new series and that the character was never fully developed compared to the other characters in the show. Many campaigns to save the character were created after the announcement, the most notable being the F.O.R.D. campaign. Francks said that the change was not a \\"blow\\", since he and Brad Wright had already discussed the change. He was also more positive in the change of story arc for the character, saying he was a \\"big part\\" of the second season compared to season one where they hadn't had enough episodes to broaden the character. When asked about reducing Francks' role in Atlantis, Wright replied \\"The change in status means that Francks will not appear in every episode, and will not be listed in the show's opening credits.\\" Reception Fans of the character set up campaigns to get Ford back as a main character later in season two or season three. They sent various petitions to the producers, cast and crew of Stargate Atlantis to change their minds. Fans of the character even put up a website under the name F.O.R.D., which in turn was also the name for one of the campaigns fighting for the revival of the character.

Paterson Inlet is a large natural harbour in the eastern coast of Stewart Island/Rakiura, New Zealand, much of which is unspoilt forest. This region was first inhabited by the MƒÅori, who settled at a locale known as The Neck, which is a long peninsula that extends across the mouth of the inlet from the southern coast. The only town on Stewart Island, Oban is located on the north coast of the inlet, close to its mouth. In earlier times, the inlet was used as a base for whaling. Southern right whales were the main target in this area and over exploited. However, their sightings around the island are increasing recently. Paterson Inlet has three main arms; North Arm and South West Arm lie at the upper reaches of the inlet, 15 kilometres from its mouth. Big Glory Bay, the third arm of the inlet, lies behind The Neck in the southeast of the inlet. The inlet drains the Rakeahua and Freshwater Rivers, the latter of which drains a large swampy valley that covers much of the northern part of the island. Several islands lie in the inlet, notably Ulva Island and Native Island. In June 2004 the government announced that Paterson Inlet will become a mƒÅtaitai to be known as Te Whaka a Te Wera MƒÅtaitai Reserve.

Two prominent theories are the Neurological theories of Chase that attribute expectation building and anticipation both to inherent Neurological pitch evolution (Darwinian selection as pitch/rhythm/harmony communication response expectation) and the related skillful use of chord sequences (holding V7 until expectations are met with E, A, B7, or the well known Am/D7/G tease- satisfy sequence, with variations in the wheel of fifths). A second well- accepted theory is Huron's \\"ITPRA\\" 5 module theory of expectation, where previous imaginative tension hits the event onset/horizon, with prediction and reaction oscillating (alternating) in the response system, and resulting in appraisal feedback.Wayne Chase, \\"How Music Really Works\\" (Vancouver, 2006), , pp. 434, 621David Huron,\\"Sweet Anticipation, Music and the psychology of expectation\\" (Cambridge, 2006), , p.17 From a global perspective, even given thousands of varying scale types worldwide, there is a universal human sense of satisfaction in the return to that scale's tonic (for example, C, in the major scale, key, and tonic of C major).Michael Hewitt,\\"Musical Scales of the World\\" (London, 2013), , p. 11 et. al In the context of the broader topic of Music and emotion, Juslin & V√§stfj√§ll's BRECVEM model includes, as its seventh element, Musical expectation.Juslin, Liljestr√∂m, V√§stfj√§ll, & Lundqvist.

In phenomenology For phenomenological philosopher Edmund Husserl, anticipation is an essential feature of human action. \\"In every action we know the goal in advance in the form of an anticipation that is 'empty', in the sense of vague...and [we] seek by our action to bring it step by step to concrete realization\\".E. Husserl, in Alfred Schutz, The Phenomenology of the Social World (Illinois 1997), p. 58 Anticipation can be shown in many ways; for example, some people seem to smile uncontrollably during this period, while others seem ill or sick. It is not uncommon for the brain to be so focused on an event, that the body is affected in such a way. Stage fright is a type of anticipation, stemming from the actor or actress hoping that they perform well.  In pop culture  The musical The Rocky Horror Show and subsequent film use the phrase in a literal way, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter saying \\"I see you shiver with antici.......pation\\" (holding the breath between antici- and -pation for several seconds) during \\"Sweet Transvestite\\". Since the movie became a cult film, it has become one of the most iconic and highly quoted lines.

In most cases, an increase in the severity of symptoms is also noted. Anticipation is common in trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, where a dynamic mutation in DNA occurs. All of these diseases have neurological symptoms. Prior to the understanding of the genetic mechanism for anticipation, it was debated whether anticipation was a true biological phenomenon or whether the earlier age of diagnosis was related to heightened awareness of disease symptoms within a family. Trinucleotide repeats and expansion Trinucleotide repeats are apparent in a number of loci in the human genome. They have been found in introns, exons and 5' or 3' UTR's. They consist of a pattern of three nucleotides (e.g. CGG) which is repeated a number of times. During meiosis, unstable repeats can undergo triplet expansion (see later section); in this case, the germ cells produced have a greater number of repeats than are found in the somatic tissues. The mechanism behind the expansion of the triplet repeats is not well understood. One hypothesis is that the increasing number of repeats influence the overall shape of the DNA, which can have an effect on its interaction with DNA polymerase and thus the expression of the gene.  Disease mechanisms  For many of the loci, trinucleotide expansion is harmless, but in some areas expansion has detrimental effects that cause symptoms. When the trinucleotide repeat is present within the protein-coding region, the repeat expansion leads to production of a mutant protein with gain of function. This is the case for Huntington's disease, where the trinucleotide repeat encodes a long stretch of glutamine residues. When the repeat is present in an untranslated region, it could affect the expression of the gene in which the repeat is found (ex. fragile X) or many genes through a dominant negative effect (ex. myotonic dystrophy). In order to have a deleterious effect, the number of repeats must cross a certain threshold. For example, normal individuals have between 5 and 30 CTG repeats within the 3' UTR of DMPK, the gene that is altered in myotonic dystrophy. If the number of repeats is between 50 and 100, the person is only mildly affected ‚Äì perhaps having only cataracts. However, meiotic instability could result in a dynamic mutation that increases the number of repeats in offspring inheriting the mutant allele. Once the number of copies reaches over 100, the disease will manifest earlier in life (although the individual will still reach adulthood before the symptoms are evident) and the symptoms will be more severe ‚Äì including electrical myotonia. As the number progresses upwards past 400, the symptoms show themselves during childhood or infancy. Examples of diseases showing anticipation Diseases showing anticipation include: *Autosomal dominant **Several spinocerebellar ataxias **Huntington's disease ‚Äì CAG **Myotonic dystrophy ‚Äì CTG **Dyskeratosis congenita ‚Äì TTAGGG (telomere repeat sequence) *Autosomal recessive **Friedreich ataxia ‚Äì GAA (Note: Friedreich ataxia does not usually exhibit anticipation because it is an autosomal recessive disorder.Link text, NCBI Bookshelf: Friedreich Ataxia.) *X-linked **Fragile X syndrome ‚Äì CGG *Without expression type **Crohn's disease **Beh√ßet's disease References  External links  * Category:Genetic disorders by mechanism ","title":"Anticipation (genetics)"},{"id":"1126216","text":"In artificial intelligence (AI), anticipation occurs when an agent makes decisions based on its explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, \\"anticipation\\" can also refer to the ability to act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, without necessarily explicitly possessing a model of the future events. The concept stays in contrast to the reactive paradigm, which is not able to predict future system states. In AI An agent employing anticipation would try to predict the future state of the environment (weather in this case) and make use of the predictions in the decision making. For example, If the sky is cloudy and the air pressure is low, it will probably rain soon so take the umbrella with you. Otherwise leave the umbrella home. These rules explicitly take into account possible future events. In 1985, Robert Rosen defined an anticipatory system as follows:Anticipatory Systems: Philosophical, Mathematical, and Methodological Foundations, Robert Rosen, 1985, Pergamon Press :A system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment, :which allows it to change state at an instant in accord :with the model's predictions pertaining to a later instant. To some extent, Rosen's definition of anticipation applies to any system incorporating machine learning. At issue is how much of a system's behaviour should or indeed can be determined by reasoning over dedicated representations, how much by on-line planning, and how much must be provided by the system's designers. In animals Humans can make decisions based on explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, animals can act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, although they may not necessarily have an explicit cognitive model of the future; evolution may have shaped simpler systemic features that result in adaptive anticipatory behavior in a narrow domain.Poli, Roberto. \\"The many aspects of anticipation.\\" Foresight 12.3 (2010): 7-17.

It most commonly affects the nasal cavity‚Äîthe nose is involved in 95‚Äì100 per cent of cases‚Äîhowever, it can also affect the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Slightly more females than males are affected and patients are usually 10 to 30 years of age. Rhinoscleroma is considered a tropical disease and is mostly endemic to North Africa, South Asia and Central America, less common in the United States. Signs and symptoms Rhinoscleroma has been divided into 3 stages: catarrhal/atrophic, granulomatous, and sclerotic stages. The catarrhal stage begins with a nonspecific rhinitis, which progresses into purulent, fetid rhinorrhea, and crusting, which can last for weeks or even months. The granulomatous stage results in the development of a bluish red nasal mucosa and the development of intranasal rubbery nodules or polyps. Nose bleeds, nasal deformity, and destruction of the nasal cartilage are also noted (Hebra nose). The damage may result in anesthesia of the soft palate, enlargement of the uvula, dysphonia, and various degrees of airway obstruction. The fibrotic stage is characterized by sclerosis and fibrosis. Lymphadenitis is absent. Causes It is caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis‚Äîsubspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae‚Äî a gram-negative, encapsulated, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacillus (diplobacillus), member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Frisch bacillus,\\" named for Anton von Frisch who identified the organism in 1882.DiBartolomeo. Page 14. It is contracted directly by droplets or by contamination of material that is subsequently inhaled. Diagnosis Micrograph showing abundant subepithelial histiocytes in a case of rhinoscleroma. H&E; stain. A positive culture in MacConkey agar is diagnostic, but cultures are only positive in 50‚Äì60% of cases. Diagnostic characteristics are most commonly found in the granulomatous stage and are described as being plasma cells with birefringent inclusions, Russell bodies, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and groups of large vacuolated histiocytes containing Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (Mikulicz cells). Prognosis and treatment It is not lethal in nature and is responsive to tetracycline or ciprofloxacin. Surgical treatment include rhinoplasty. However, if left untreated the disease can lead to sepsis, bleeding, or other chronic conditions that can be fatal. History Hans von Hebra (1847‚Äì1902) wrote the classical description of the disease in a paper published in the January 1870 issue of the Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift.Hebra.Garrison & Morton (GM 3277). Hans von Hebra was the son of Czech born dermatologist Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816‚Äì1880), founder of the New Vienna School of Dermatology. He was assisted by M. Kohn who provided much of the histology for the paper. M. Kohn is the birth name of Moritz Kaposi (1837‚Äì1902). In 1876, Mikulicz contributed to the microscopic histology. In 1882, Anton Von Frisch (1849‚Äì1917) discovered the gram-negative bacillus which causes the disease.Frisch. Terminology Hebra nose. Scleroma. Fr: Scl√©rome. Sp: Rinoscleroma. Ger: Sklerom.

The game, also known as Under Cover or Detective & Co, won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1986. The object of the game is to score the most points, while not revealing which colour you are until the end. It requires good bluffing and analytical skills. 7 colours are used, and there can be up to 4 \\"robot\\" colours moving around. On their turn a player rolls a die and can move any number of pieces a total number of spaces that adds up to the number on the die. This can result in a score, and the game continues until one player reaches 129+ points. At this time all players make secret guesses as to which player is which colour (gaining +5 points at the end of the game for each correct answer). The game ends when a spy reaches 142+ points, and then a winner is determined after guess points are added.

The ethnonym \\"Mede\\" was often used by the Greeks of the Persians although, strictly speaking, the Medes were a different Iranian people, subject to the Persians. It was not until the 470s that the Greeks began to refer to \\"Persians\\", with Aeschylus' play The Persians in 472 being an early example of this. Medism was considered a faux pas, even a crime, in many ancient Greek city-states. However, it does not seem to have been specifically criminalised. For instance, in Athens suspected Medisers were charged with treason. The evidence suggests that this was true of other Greek city-states too: in Teos, for instance, a law from the classical period provided that anyone who betrayed the city should be punished by death, but failed to distinguish betrayal to the Persians from betrayal to any other group. Themistocles the Athenian was ostracized for medism. Pausanias, the Lacedaemonian hegemon of the Hellenic League in the Battle of Plataea, was accused of medism by other member states, an accusation which allowed Athens to seize control of the league. Herodotus mentions the so- called \\"state medism\\" of Aegina, Thessaly, Argos, Thebes, and other Boeotians. Astute politicians in Athens often exploited popular feelings against medism as a means to their own advancement, which once led to a feud between the poets Timocreon of Rhodes and Simonides of Ceos in support of and against Themistocles, respectively.Rachel M.

His prenomen or royal name was Bakare, which means \\"Glorious is the Soul of Re.\\" Filiation He was the son of King Shabaka and the nephew of his predecessor Taharqa. In some sources he is said to be the son of Shebitku. Assyrian records call Tantamani a son of Shabaka and refer to Qalhata as a sister of Taharqa. Some Egyptologists interpreted the Assyrian text as stating that Tantamani was a son of Shebitku, but as he was most likely a son of Shabaka himself, it is now more common to consider Tantamani a son of Shabaka. Conflict with Ashurpanipal of Assyria Portrait of Tantamani, Sudan National Museum. Ashurbanipal's account of his Second Sampaign in Egypt against Tantamani (\\"Urdamanee\\"/ \\"Ruddamon\\"), in the Rassam cylinder Once the Assyrians had appointed Necho I as king and left, Egypt was still seen as vulnerable. Tantamani soon invaded Egypt in hopes of restoring his family to the throne. Tantamani marched down the Nile from Nubia and reoccupied all of Egypt including Memphis. Necho I, the Assyrians' representative, was killed in Tantamani's campaign. This led to a renewed conflict with Ashurbanipal in 663 BCE. In reaction, the Assyrians led by Ashurbanipal returned to Egypt in force. Together with Psamtik I's army, which comprised Carian mercenaries, they fought a pitched battle in north Memphis, close to the temple of Isis, between the Serapeum and Abusir. Tantamani was defeated and fled to Upper Egypt but just forty days after the battle, Ashurbanipal's army arrived in Thebes. Tantamani had already left the city for Kipkipi, a location that remains uncertain but might be Kom Ombo, some south of Thebes. The city of Thebes was conquered, \\"smashed (as if by) a floodstorm\\" and heavily plundered in the Sack of Thebes. The event is not mentioned in Egyptian sources but is known from the Assyrian annals,Robert G. Morkot: The Black Pharaohs, Egypt's Nubian Rulers, London , p. 296 which report that the inhabitants were deported. The Assyrians took a large booty of gold, silver, precious stones, clothes, horses, fantastic animals, as well as two obelisks covered in electrum weighting 2.500 talents (c. 75.5 tons, or 166,500 lb): Capture of Memphis by the Assyrians. The sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3:8-10: A prophecy in the Book of Isaiah20:3-5 refers to the sack as well: The Assyrian reconquest effectively ended Nubian control over Egypt although Tantamani's authority was still recognised in Upper Egypt until his 8th Year in 656 BCE when Psamtik I's navy peacefully took control of Thebes and effectively unified all of Egypt. These events marked the start of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Later rule Thereafter, Tantamani ruled only Nubia (Kush). He died in 653 BC and was succeeded by Atlanersa, a son of Taharqa. He was buried in the family cemetery at El-Kurru. The archaeologist Charles Bonnet discovered the statue of Tantamani at Kerma (now called Doukki Gel) in 2003.

Suarez played college soccer at San Jose State University from 1997 to 2000, and was named an NCAA All-American his senior season. He also played for the Silicon Valley Ambassadors in the Premier Development League. Upon graduating, Suarez was drafted 7th overall by the Dallas Burn in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Suarez played very well in his debut season, starting 19 games while scoring 2 goals and 3 assists, and showing an attacking instinct and physicality that looked to make him very dangerous in Major League Soccer. Although Suarez played consistently in his second season, starting 24 games and recording a goal and 2 assists for the Burn, his lack of improvement troubled many. His third season brought a move to center back, which Suarez did not take happily to ‚Äì in midseason, he was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy with Paul Broome and Antonio Mart√≠nez in exchange for Ezra Hendrickson and Gavin Glinton. Suarez's time with the Galaxy was limited by injuries, playing only 3 games.

Suarez's efforts earned him the respect of Galaxy supporters and even brought him the LA Riot Squad (LARS) Player of the Year Award. Chivas USA acquired Suarez before the 2005 season. Chivas USA coach Hans Westerhof subbed Suarez out in the 28th minute during the team's June 25 loss to the Kansas City Wizards; Westerhof had wanted the defense to play forward, and Suarez was not complying. A heated exchange followed, and Suarez was waived by the club two days later. He was then claimed off waivers by the MetroStars. He was released in November 2005 after playing just 4 games for the team. In 2006, Suarez signed with Vancouver, and helped the Caps win their first USL First Division Championship by beating the Rochester Raging Rhinos 3-0. On May 17, 2007 Suarez signed with the California Victory. Upon his arrival in MLS, Suarez was touted as a prospect for the US national team's right back position. His lack of development and his move to center back, however, make it unlikely that he will see much time with the team. Although Suarez had the option of playing for Uruguay, he committed himself to the United States, playing his only cap on May 26, 2003 against Wales.

The company manufactured Willys Jeeps and its minor modified versions, with modifications carried out in India. In 1996, the company planned to enter the SUV segment with a new product that could compete globally. Since M&M; did not have the technical knowhow to handle such an ambitious product, they devised an entirely new concept among Indian auto companies. Roping in new executives who had worked in the auto industry in western countries, such as Pawan Goenka and Alan Durante. Mahindra Scorpio Getaway, the pick-up version The new Mahindra Scorpio SUV had all of its major systems designed directly by suppliers, with the only inputs from Mahindra being design, performance specifications and program cost. The design and engineering of the systems were carried out by suppliers, as well as testing, validation, and materials selection. Sourcing and engineering locations were also chosen by suppliers. The parts were later assembled in a Mahindra plant under the Mahindra badge, being a well-known brand in India. Using this method, the company was able to build from scratch a new vehicle with virtually 100 percent supplier involvement from concept to reality, at a cost of Rs 600 crore ($120 million), including improvements to the plant. The project took five years to move from concept to final product. The cost was estimated in 2002 to be Rs 550 crore. =mHawk Engine= The mHawk diesel engine holds a capacity of 2.2-litres with four cylinders that delivers of power and of torque. The mHawk employs a top-mounted intercooler to improve turbocharger efficiency. The engine is based on the Bosch Common Rail system with solenoid injectors and fuel spray design that improves fuel efficiency. The mHawk is equipped with a two-chain drive stage system and hydraulic lash adjusters. A variable geometry turbocharger controls the boost. The compressed air is cooled by an intercooler which is mounted upstream of the turbocharger. The compression ratio ranges from 16.5:1 to 18.5:1.

It had six bars serving liquor and two more serving soft drinks and a $1 cover charge and a $3 charge for dinner. During World War II, the Palladium hosted radio broadcasts featuring Betty Grable greeting servicemens' song requests. Big Band acts began losing popularity in the 1950s, causing the Palladium to hold charity balls, political events, auto shows, and rock concerts. In 1961, it became the home of the long-running Lawrence Welk Show. From 1955‚Äì1976, the venue was the scene of Latin Music Orchestras for ragers sponsored by radio personality Chico Sesma titled Latin Holidays,‚Äù featuring childhood friend Ray Vasquez Recording Artist, Lead Vocalist and Trombonist. The Tito Puente Orchestra performed regularly between 1957-1977 to sold-out houses of 5000.Josephine Powell, \\"Tito Puente: When The Drums Are Dreaming\\", Author House 2007. President John F. Kennedy attended a dinner given in his honor by the California Democratic Party at the Palladium on November 18, 1961. In 1964, it was announced that none of the jazz bands scheduled were to be paid and a riot ensued after the show was cancelled. The Joe Loco Orchestra and show performed on the March 1965 Latin Holiday with singer/dancer Josephine \\"Josie\\" Powell. Pop Expo '69, referred to as a \\"teenage fair,\\" was a youth-oriented event held from 28 March to 6 April 1969 at the Palladium, and included performances by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and the MC5. In 1973 Stevie Wonder performed with Taj Mahal in what was advertised as an \\"Afrocentric concert\\" to benefit African refugees. Beginning in the 1980s and 90s, punk rock, rap and heavy metal concerts started to be booked at the venue. Several white power disturbances resulted, eventually leading to the Palladium closing for eight weeks, starting in February 1993. Since 1985, the theater has been owned by Palladium Investors Ltd., a privately held group. Curfews were implemented in 1993 and a show by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was called off because of a brawl that occurred a few nights earlier, . It was also used for Hollywood celebrity parties. Renovation and reopening In 2007, the owners agreed to a long-term lease to operate, manage and exclusively book the Hollywood Palladium with Live Nation, a Los Angeles-based company. The Palladium reopened with a Jay-Z concert on October 15, 2008 after a year-long, multimillion-dollar renovation by Live Nation. The renovation included an overhaul of the venue's interior and exterior, a new dance floor, expanded concessions, upgraded restrooms and improvements to the stage infrastructure. Jay-Z performed for nearly an hour-and-half, backed by an eight-piece band and DJ AM, who played his first show after surviving a plane crash in South Carolina. The Hollywood Palladium was also used as the memorial service site for DJ AM on September 3, 2009. For the 2008‚Äì2009 season, a yearlong table for four cost $30,000. =Residential expansion= An expansion of the Palladium property parking lot was approved by the Los Angeles City council in March 2016. The plan consists of two 28 story residential towers that surrounds the historic music venue. Each tower will stand tall and create 731 condominiums, store front retail space and a below grade parking garage. The Towers were designed by Stanley Saitowits of Natoma Architects for developer Crescent Heights. The \\"L\\" shaped design resembles and echoes the Streamline Moderne - art deco design of the Palladium. The local AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) filed a lawsuit in 2016 citing over development and improper approval process. One of many local lawsuits filed by AHF president Michael Weinstein. In August 2018, the district court ruled all steps were taken during EIR/DEIR. The AHF filed an appeal. The AHF lost the appeal in November 2019 and Crescent Heights plans to proceed. In popular culture The Hollywood Palladium has been featured in many movies and TV shows over the years: *The Day of the Locust (1975).Lawson, Kristan, & Rufus, Anneli (2000).

Route description SR 9 begins in the city of Santa Cruz where River Street intersects with SR 1. It heads north, paralleling the San Lorenzo River. The road is a winding two-lane road for the majority of its length until it approaches Fruitvale Avenue in Saratoga. SR 9 winds through the mountains north of Santa Cruz, passing through the communities of Felton, Ben Lomond, Brookdale, and Boulder Creek, where State Route 236 departs from SR 9 to provide access to Big Basin Redwoods State Park. SR 236 later rejoins SR 9 near Castle Rock State Park. At the summit of the Santa Cruz mountains (the junction with SR 35 and after a steep climb), there is a vista point offering a (somewhat obstructed) view of the Bay Area. The vista point is the route's highest point at around .USGS benchmark, quad located at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lon=-122.1207961‚™´=37.2582767&datum;=nad83 At this junction, SR 9 passes into Santa Clara County. SR 9 descends from the mountains heading east into Saratoga as Congress Springs Road. In Saratoga, SR 9 turns southeast and becomes Saratoga-Los Gatos Road. At Fruitvale Avenue in Saratoga, SR 9 briefly becomes a four-lane highway with a large center divider. However, as the road enters Monte Sereno, it again becomes a two-lane road. This particular narrowing has caused backups in the past; however, they have become more infrequent since the completion of SR 85. SR 9 resumes being a four-lane road through downtown Los Gatos until its terminus at the junction with SR 17 (a distance of about four city blocks). = Usage = SR 9 is particularly popular for recreational motorcycling with motorcyclists from all over Northern California and beyond flocking to it at weekends. In summer months the short section between SR 35, Skyline Boulevard and SR 236, Big Basin Road becomes a popular destination for a variety of motorcycle types, and impromptu gatherings of riders in the parking lot at intersection of SR 35 and SR 9 known locally as \\"four corners\\" are commonplace. SR 9 is also popular with bicyclists. The section from Saratoga Village to the Saratoga Gap is notable for the number of bicycles climbing the hill on weekend mornings. Since 1978, the highway between downtown Saratoga and downtown Los Gatos is the route for the popular \\"Great Race,\\" when over 1,000 participants run between the two towns near the end of April.https://losgatosrotary.org/stories/the-great-race = Classification = A small portion of SR 9 towards the northern terminus is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 9 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, and, between the Los Gatos town limit and the intersection with SR 35, is officially a scenic highway, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. History SR 9 was created from several previously constructed roads. One of these was a toll road built in 1848 by Martin McCarty. In 1913, the road from Saratoga Gap southwest to Big Basin Redwoods State Park via the present SR 9 and SR 236 was added to the state highway system; it became Route 42 (an unsigned designation) in 1917.Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 (Archive.org or Internet Archive), p. 114 Although this highway connected to Route 44, the remainder of present SR 236, the only connection to the continuous state highway system was with the Skyline Boulevard (Route 55, now SR 35) at Saratoga Gap. This changed in 1933, when Route 42 was extended east from the gap to Route 5 (SR 17) in Los Gatos, and a new Route 116 was created, running south from Route 42 at Waterman Gap (about halfway between Saratoga Gap and the park) to Santa Cruz, intersecting the end of Route 44 at Boulder Creek.: \\"State Highway Route 55 near Saratoga Gap to State Highway Route 5 near Los Gatos.\\" \\"Santa Cruz to State Highway Route 42 near Waterman Gap.\\": \\"Route 42 is from Route 5 near Los Gatos to Governor's Camp in California Redwood Park via Saratoga Gap and along the ridge between the San Lorenzo and Pescadero creeks.\\" \\"Route 116 is from Santa Cruz to Route 42 near Waterman Gap.\\" Sign Route 9 was marked in 1934; however, it did not entirely follow the present SR 9. Initially it connected Santa Cruz with Milpitas, following Routes 116 and 42 to Saratoga, Route 114 (Saratoga Sunnyvale Road and Mathilda Avenue) north through Sunnyvale, and Route 113 (SR 237) east to Route 5 (Main Street, then U.S. Route 101E and Sign Route 13) in Milpitas. When the San Jose-Oakland US 101E designation was dropped in the mid-1930s, Route 5 between Mission San Jose (where the new SR 21 turned northeast) and Hayward did not retain a signed designation.H.M. Gousha Company, San Francisco and Vicinity , 1941 Later SR 9 was extended north along SR 17 (which had replaced SR 13) from Milpitas to Warm Springs, SR 21 to Mission San Jose, and the independent section of former US 101E‚Äîall part of Route 5‚Äîto US 50 (also Route 5, which included a branch to Oakland) near Hayward.H.M. Gousha Company, San Francisco Street and Vicinity Maps, Standard Oil Company of California, 1953 Except for a short realignment in the mid-1950s onto Route 69 (now I-880 and SR 262) between Milpitas and Warm Springs,H.M. Gousha Company, Enlarged Map of the San Francisco District , 1955 this alignment remained until the 1964 renumbering.Department of Public Works, San Francisco Bay Area, 1963 In 1964, SR 9 was moved to its present alignment, taking over the previously unsigned Route 42 from Saratoga to Los Gatos. The route that had been signed as SR 9 became SR 85 through Sunnyvale, SR 237 to Milpitas (including previously unsigned extensions of Route 113 at each end), part of SR 17 through Warm Springs, SR 262 through Warm Springs, part of I-680 to Mission San Jose, and SR 238 from Mission San Jose to Hayward (SR 21 was already renumbered I-680 by then). SR 85's original designation was deleted in 1994 and has since moved to a freeway and SR 17 in Warm Springs was renumbered I-880 a decade prior. However, the SR 237 freeway was built in the same location, and both SR 238 and most of SR 262 remain as surface roads.

They are marked by the state flower, a California poppy, inside either a rectangle for state- maintained highways or a pentagon for county highways.California Department of Transportation District 3, Scenic Highway Program, accessed January 2008 The California State Legislature makes state highways eligible for designation as a scenic highway, listing them in the Streets and Highways Code, sections 260-284. For a highway to then be declared scenic by Caltrans, the local government with jurisdiction over abutting land must adopt a \\"scenic corridor protection program\\" that limits development, outdoor advertising, and earthmoving, and Caltrans must agree that it meets the criteria. The desire to create such a designation has at times been in conflict with the property rights of abutters, for example on State Route 174.Sacramento Bee, Scenic Highway Concept Spurs Alarm, March 25, 1999, p. N1Dave Moller, Union of Grass Valley, CABPRO's Urke steps down, August 7, 2004 Any county highway that is believed to have outstanding scenic qualities is considered eligible, and the county with jurisdiction must follow Caltrans' same approval process as state highways to be declared scenic.

He has worked in the Dallas radio market for 31 years. Martin hosted the No. 1-rated The Russ Martin Show on KLLI Live 105.3 in Dallas, until Dec. 8, 2008, when KLLI switched to an all-sports format. On July 12, 2010, Martin returned to radio with his afternoon (3p-7p) show on 97.1 \\"The Eagle\\" (KEGL). Biography Martin grew up in Pleasant Grove, a large, working-class neighborhood in southeast Dallas, where he graduated from W.W. Samuell High School. Martin's radio career began in the 1980s at KGVL 1400 AM in Greenville, Texas, working 6 p.m. to midnight running the board for religious programs. In 1982, Martin was hired by KTLR 107.1 FM in Terrell, Texas, to play country music on weekends. A year later, in 1983, he was hired by KAAM 1310 AM in Dallas as a part-time weekend disc jockey. In 1986, Martin was hired for another part-time position by the Satellite Music Network for an oldies format, and later worked part-time for Z-Rock while still working at KAAM and KAFM. In 1987 Martin was hired by Top-40 station KEGL, \\"The Eagle,\\" in Dallas. He also hosted a talk show on Sunday nights at KEGL. He hosted the television shows Hot TV and Hot Tickets which ran from 1988 to 1994 on the then local FOX affiliate KDAF.Published on December 5, 2004, Page 1D, Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX) Charity work Martin founded The Russ Martin Show Listeners Foundation in 2002, which benefits the families of police officers and firefighters who have died in the line of duty. The Foundation also coordinates an annual parade called the Heroes Day Parade.

Martin also owns a collection of classic TV show cars such as a Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee replica, the fastest 1966 Batmobile replica, a Munster Koach replica, and the 1976 Ford Grand Torino from Starsky and Hutch. The Russ Martin Show The first incarnation of The Russ Martin Show began following the departure of The Howard Stern Show from KEGL. In 1997 he was asked to fill morning drive time slot. Within two years, Martin's ratings had surpassed those of Dallas veteran radio personality Ron Chapman.The Dallas Morning News 10/22/1999 In 2000, Martin left KEGL following a contract dispute. The Russ Martin Show reappeared on KYNG, a station that had previously been country-western music. Martin began his first show at KYNG on April 6, 2000, once again filling the morning drive time slot. When Howard Stern was picked up by KYNG, The Russ Martin Show moved from its morning drive slot to 3-7 p.m. In 2003, KYNG changed its call letters to KLLI and took on the Live 105.3 branding. The Russ Martin Show had consistently high ratings for KLLI since his show debuted on 105.3.The Dallas Morning News 1/27/2002 In 2005 D Magazine named Martin best radio talk show host in the DFW area.D Magazine August, 2005. In December 2008, Live 105.3 changed its format to include more live sports programming, and Martin was eliminated during the switch.Subsequently, his former staffer spoke out against him. \\"Stuff he'd say to us on the air he wouldn't say to us in the hall, because he's a coward,\\" says J.D. Ryan, Martin's radio right-hand man for 25 years. \\"To him everything was a bit, but eventually he crossed the line. It became personal. He made it clear that being successful wasn't enough. For him to be truly happy, those around him also had to fail miserably.\\" On July 1, 2010, KEGL ran a promo announcing the return of The Russ Martin Show.

Controversy  The police of Southlake, Texas, arrested Russ Martin while at Larry North Fitness on July 18, 2008, for charges of aggravated assault-bodily injury-deadly weapon following an incident occurring on July 14, 2008, concerning his then girlfriend Mandy Blake.http://static.cbslocal.com/station/ktvt/docs/2008/july/martin.pdf Martin was accused of pulling her hair, kicking her, and brandishing a pistol.http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/64796212.html According to the arrest warrant affidavit, on July 14, Martin called the woman and asked if she had followed up about a package he sent to the IRS. When she told him she had not, the document says, he allegedly told her, among other things, \\"You better hide, because when I get there I'm going to beat the shit out of you.\\" https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/the-alleged-events-leading-up-to-russ- martins-arrest-friday-morning-7097741 His charges were later reduced to misdemeanor assault. Two weeks prior to Martin's scheduled court date he accepted a plea bargain and pleaded no contest. Martin was placed on two years of deferred probation, and was required to complete a batterer's intervention program to clear his record. On February 10, 2009, nearly eight months after the incident, Mandy Blake filed a complaint with the Southlake police department, claiming she had been coerced into making a statement for what she considered a very minor incident. In an interview with Janet St. James, Martin stated that no one from the DA's office or Southlake police had ever contacted him to get his side of the story.

It was the first expedition to reach the South Pole overland for 46 years, preceded only by Amundsen's expedition and Scott's expedition in 1911 and 1912. In keeping with the tradition of polar expeditions of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, the CTAE was a private venture, though it was supported by the governments of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, United States, Australia and South Africa, as well as many corporate and individual donations, under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II. It was headed by British explorer Sir Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. The New Zealand party included scientists participating in International Geophysical Year research while the British team were separately based at Halley Bay. Fuchs was knighted for his accomplishment. The second overland crossing of the continent did not occur until 1981, during the Transglobe Expedition led by Ranulph Fiennes.  Preparation  Hillary packs a sack in preparation Preparations began in London in 1955. Over the austral summer of 1955 to 1956, Fuchs sailed with an advance party from London to Antarctica in the Canadian sealer Theron, with the purpose of establishing Shackleton Base near Vahsel Bay on the Weddell Sea, from which the trans-Antarctic expedition would begin. The Theron, like its immediate forebears, the , was trapped in the ice. Despite sustaining considerable damage, she was able to free herself with the help of the Auster Antarctic floatplane that scouted a way out. In early 1956, Fuchs sailed back to London, leaving eight men to over-winter at Shackleton. The eight men of the advance party, led by Kenneth Blaiklock, were left on the ice, having only tents and a packing crate as shelter. Most of the stores were left on the bay ice, some from the site of where the base was to be set up. Their first task was to get all these stores from the bay ice to the base and to try to build some permanent shelter for the oncoming winter. Once some food and paraffin had been brought up and the dogs safely tethered by the base, the men started to build their hut. This proved to be far more difficult than had been envisaged ‚Äì not only were the eight men insufficient in number to carry out the heavy tasks easily but the weather at Shackleton was colder and much windier than had been anticipated. When the skeleton of the hut was complete, the men positioned the crates containing the wall and roof panels around the building site. Then a blizzard began, and lasted for more than a week. The temperature dropped to and the drift around the base made it impossible to do any work outside. The men sheltered in their crate and slept in their tents which were constantly in danger of getting buried by the drift. When finally the wind subsided the giant crates of wall panels had all disappeared under many feet of drift and the unfinished hut itself was full of snow. The bay ice had broken off taking all the remaining stores with it. Much food and fuel, a couple of huts and a tractor had all gone to sea. The men tried to retrieve the crates by tunnelling under the snow; the tunnels proved to be useful kennels for the dogs protecting them from the unexpectedly severe winter conditions at Shackleton. The party of eight survived the winter with some difficulty, but in reasonably good health, and finally completed the building of the hut except for one hole in the roof, the panel for which was never found. While the hut was being constructed they lived by day in the tractor crate and slept in their tents, two men to each tent. The winter temperatures often fell well below , and Shackleton proved to be a very windy place, which made work outdoors unpleasant. All stores lying in the snow tended to get buried and there was a constant danger of them getting lost. They managed to take a number of journeys to collect seals for the dogs and to scout a route to the south. They used dogs and the Weasel tractor, while the one Sno-Cat that they had never functioned properly as it seemed that someone had dropped a nut into one of its eight cylinders.  Expedition  Hillary with George J. Dufek at Scott Base, just before departure In December 1956, Fuchs returned on Danish Polar vessel Magga Dan with additional supplies, and the southern summer of 1956‚Äì1957 was spent consolidating Shackleton Base and establishing the smaller South Ice Base, about inland to the south. After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a 12-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasel tractors, and one specially adapted Muskeg tractor. En route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings. In parallel, Hillary's team had set up Scott Base‚Äîwhich was to be Fuchs' final destination‚Äîon the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea. Using three converted Ferguson TE20 tractorsFriends of Ferguson Heritage- The Worst Journey in the World and one Weasel, abandoned part-way, Hillary and his three men‚ÄîRon Balham, Peter Mulgrew and Murray Ellis)‚Äîwere responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the Skelton Glacier and across the Polar Plateau on towards the South Pole, for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas. It was not originally intended that Hillary would travel as far as the South Pole, but when he had completed laying supply depots he saw the opportunity to beat the British and continued south, reaching the Pole‚Äîwhere the U.S. Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station had recently been established by air‚Äîon 3 January 1958. Hillary's party was just the third‚Äîpreceded by Roald Amundsen in 1911 and Robert Falcon Scott in 1912‚Äîto reach the Pole overland. Hillary's arrival also marked the first time that land vehicles had ever reached the Pole. Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid, while Hillary flew back to Scott Base in a U.S. plane. He would later rejoin Fuchs by plane for part of the remaining overland journey. The overland party finally arrived at Scott Base on 2 March 1958, having completed the historic crossing of of previously unexplored snow and ice in 99 days. A few days later the expedition members left Antarctica for New Zealand on the New Zealand naval ship . The ship was captained by Captain Harry Kirkwood. Although large quantities of supplies were hauled overland, both parties were also equipped with light aircraft and made extensive use of air support for reconnaissance and supplies. Additional logistical help was provided by U.S. personnel who were working in Antarctica at that time. Both parties also took dog teams which were used for fieldwork trips and backup in case of failure of the mechanical transportation, though the dogs were not taken all the way to the Pole. In December 1957 four men from the expedition flew one of the planes‚Äîa de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter‚Äîon an 11-hour, , non- stop trans-polar flight across the Antarctic continent from Shackleton Base via the Pole to Scott Base, following roughly the same route as Fuchs' overland party.

He was the traditional founder of the Hittite Old Kingdom (fl. c. 1600 - 1450 BC). His wife was Tawannanna. The existence of Labarna I is questioned by some modern scholars. Labarna was also a title of early Hittite rulers,Melchert, H. Craig, The Luwians, Brill, 2003, 18ff. such as Hattusili I. Given the relatively few contemporaneous references to Labarna I personally, some scholars have suggested that pioneering Hittitologists may have erred in assuming that Labarna was the personal name of a king. According to this theory, the first Labarna (in the sense of a title) was Hattusili I, who is normally regarded as the second Labarna.Bryce, Trevor, The Kingdom of the Hittites, Clarendon, 1998, 69 Tabarna, a variant of Labarna, is mentioned often in Hattian, Hittite, Hurrian and Akkadian texts from the Hittite archives. \\"On the Origin of the Royal Title tabarna / labarna\\".  Biography  Labarna was not the first in line to the throne. PU-Sarruma designated Labarna as his successor after his own sons revolted against him. Upon PU- Sarruma's death, Labarna and Papahdilmah, one of PU-Sarruma's sons, contended for the throne, with Labarna emerging victorious. What little is known about him is culled mainly from the Telepinu Proclamation, which states that he overwhelmed his enemies and \\"made them borders of the sea\\", ¬ß3 a statement which may refer to conquests as far as the Mediterranean coast in the south, and the Black Sea in the north. Labarna installed his sons as governors in several cities including Tuwanuwa, Hupisna, Landa, and Lusna (the identities of these cities are uncertain, but thought to perhaps be Tyana, Heraclea Cybistra, Laranda, and Lystra). Through his conquests, he was responsible for laying the groundwork for the Hittite empire that was to come.

Charles Bronson stars as the title character, a melon farmer and Vietnam War veteran who comes into conflict with gangsters. Leonard, who wrote the film with an original screenplay, took the name Majestyk from a character in his 1969 crime novel The Big Bounce. He would also write the novelization of the film. Plot Vince Majestyk (Charles Bronson) is a farmer, an ex-con, a former U. S. Army Ranger instructor and Vietnam War veteran, who owns and operates a watermelon farm in rural Colorado. He needs to harvest his crop soon in order to keep the farm financially solvent. A small-time hood, Bobby Kopas (Paul Koslo), attempts to coerce Majestyk into a protection racket of using unskilled drunks to harvest his watermelon crop. Majestyk runs him off with Kopas's own shotgun and hires experienced Mexican migrant workers, including Nancy Chavez (Linda Cristal), a crops picker who is also a union leader. They are romantically attracted to each other. Kopas brings assault charges against Majestyk, resulting in the farmer being placed under arrest before he can finish the harvest. In jail, Majestyk meets and annoys Frank Renda (Al Lettieri), a notorious mob hit man being transferred to a higher-security prison. Renda's men try to break him out of police custody during a prisoner transport by bus. In the escape attempt, Majestyk drives off in the bus with Renda still in handcuffs, eventually taking him to his hunting cabin in the nearby foothills. Majestyk hopes to trade Renda to the police in return for being released to finish harvesting his melons. Renda offers his captor $25,000 for his freedom, but Majestyk declines. Renda then threatens to kill Majestyk if he doesn't release him, and Majestyk pretends to be persuaded to take the money, but contacts both the police and Renda's mafia contacts to come pick them up. Wiley (Lee Purcell), Renda's girlfriend, arrives and they manage to turn the tables on Majestyk, although he is able to escape. Renda learns the charges for which he had been imprisoned have been dropped. He meets up with his right-hand man, Lundy (Taylor Lacher), who advises him to fly to Mexico and enjoy himself; Renda will have none of it...he wants revenge on Majestyk. He arranges for Kopas to drop the assault charges against Majestyk, and orders his men to find the \\"melon picker\\" so he can have the satisfaction of killing him personally. They arrive at the farm to kill Majestyk, but not finding him they instead machine-gun the melons and rough up the hired hands, forcing them to depart. The next day, Kopas badly injures Majestyk's friend as he tries to deliver a load of melons, putting him in hospital. As Majestyk and Nancy have a drink at a bar in town Renda approaches and tells him he plans to kill him. Instead of being intimidated, Majestyk knocks Renda down, telling him to 'call the cops', further infuriating Renda. Renda and his men surround Majestyk's home, but Majestyk gets away in the back of a pickup truck driven by Nancy, and a prolonged car chase ensues. The police set up roadblocks and launch a helicopter hoping to find them. Luring Renda and his men into the foothills, Majestyk turns the tables on them and becomes the attacker, killing most of Renda's men during the pursuit. Realizing they are now the hunted, Renda retreats to their lodge hideout where he, Wiley, Lundy and Kopas hole up. Majestyk arrives and disables their vehicle. Renda sends Wiley outside to negotiate with Majestyk, hoping to force him to show himself, but Majestyk sends her away with Nancy. Majestyk then assaults the cabin, killing Lundy after Renda sacrifices him to save himself. Disgusted, Kopas decides to leave when he realizes Renda will also sacrifice him to get to Majestyk. With Kopas' help, Majestyk gets the drop on Renda and kills him. The police soon arrive and arrest Kopas and Wiley, while Majestyk drives off with Nancy.

Reception The movie was popular with Bronson action film enthusiasts. Howard Thompson of the New York Times said, \\"Except for some dutiful splattering of gore, it ticks along rather steadily, under Richard Fleischer's unruffled direction. There is a take-it-or-leave-it air that snugly suits the star's performance, or vice versa.\\" The scene in which Nancy and Majestyk drive away in a pickup truck with Renda's men in hot pursuit became one of the most famous chase sequences of the period, following the recent trend of those in Bullitt (1968) and The French Connection (1971). Tie-ins The Ford Motor Company used scenes licensed from the movie showing extreme driving of Majestyk's Ford Pickup truck during commercials for its 1976 Ford trucks.

They are an important part of gut associated lymphoid tissue usually found in humans in the lowest portion of the small intestine, mainly in the distal jejunum and the ileum, but also could be detected in the duodenum.  Structure  Peyer's patches are observable as elongated thickenings of the intestinal epithelium measuring a few centimeters in length. About 100 are found in humans. Microscopically, Peyer's patches appear as oval or round lymphoid follicles (similar to lymph nodes) located in the mucosa layer of the ileum and extend into the submucosa layer. The number of Peyer's patches peaks at age 15‚Äì25 and then declines during adulthood. In the distal ileum, they are numerous and they form a lymphoid ring. At least 46% of Peyer's patches are concentrated in the distal 25 cm of ileum in humans. It is important to note that there are large variations in size, shape, and distribution of Peyer's patches from one individual to another one. In adults, B lymphocytes are seen to dominate the follicles' germinal centers. T lymphocytes are found in the zones between follicles. Among the mononuclear cells, CD4+/CD25+ (10%) cells and CD8+/CD25+ (5%) cells are more abundant in Peyer's patches than in the peripheral blood. Peyer's patches are characterized by the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), which covers all lymphoid follicles. FAE differs from typical small intestinal villus epithelium: it has fewer goblet cells therefore mucus layer is thinner, and it is also characterized by the presence of specialized M cells or microfold cells, which provide uptake and transport of antigens from lumen. Moreover, basal lamina of follicle-associated epithelium is more porous compared to intestinal villus. Finally, follicle- associated epithelium is less permeable for ions and macromolecules, basically due to higher expression of tight junction proteins.  Function  Because the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to the external environment, much of it is populated with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Peyer's patches thus establish their importance in the immune surveillance of the intestinal lumen and in facilitating production of the immune response within the mucosa. Pathogenic microorganisms and other antigens entering the intestinal tract encounter macrophages, dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, and T-lymphocytes found in Peyer's patches and other sites of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Peyer's patches thus act for the gastrointestinal system much as the tonsils act for the respiratory system, trapping foreign particles, surveilling them, and destroying them. Peyer's patches are covered by a special follicle-associated epithelium that contains specialized cells called microfold cells (M cells) which sample antigen directly from the lumen and deliver it to antigen-presenting cells (located in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side). Dendritic cells and macrophages can also directly sample the lumen by extending dendrites through transcellular M cell-specific pores. At the same time the paracellular pathway of follicle-associated epithelium is closed tightly to prevent penetration of antigens and continuous contact with immune cells. T cells, B-cells and memory cells are stimulated upon encountering antigen in Peyer's patches. These cells then pass to the mesenteric lymph nodes where the immune response is amplified. Activated lymphocytes pass into the blood stream via the thoracic duct and travel to the gut where they carry out their final effector functions. The maturation of B-lymphocytes takes place in the Peyer's patch. Clinical significance Although important in the immune response, excessive growth of lymphoid tissue in Peyer's patches is pathologic, as hypertrophy of Peyer's patches has been closely associated with idiopathic intussusception. Having too many or larger than normal Peyer's patches is associated with an increased risk of prion diseases. Salmonella typhi and poliovirus also target this section of the intestine.
