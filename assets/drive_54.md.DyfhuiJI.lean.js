The business had initially focused on gas and water network installations, but soon expanded into more general building work. Engineering career The 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park . John Aird's first significant scheme was the dismantling, transportation and re-erection of The Crystal Palace buildings from the 1851 Great Exhibition from central London's Hyde Park to Sydenham in south London. Other company projects included the construction of reservoirs and of railways and docks work. Aird became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1859.

History Autopoint was founded by Frank C. Deli, Michael M. Kaufmann, and John P. Lynn around 1920. They used the name \\"Realite Pencil Company.\\" They worked with Lawrence V. Redman of the Redmanol Company to develop techniques for molding plastic bodies for pencils. They took out several patents on plastic molds. The company continued to do business with Redmanol, and later with Bakelite Corporation after Redmanol had been merged into it. In the early 1920s, they made a business alliance with Charles Keeran, who had been the founder of the Eversharp Pencil Company. Keeran had previously registered the trademark \\"Autopoint.\\" Eventually, the company took the name Autopoint. The company continued to use the brand name \\"Realite\\" for its line of less expensive pencils until World War II. Around 1925, the Bakelite Corporation gained a controlling interest in the Autopoint Company. Bakelite bought out founders Kaufmann and Lynn, and appointed a president who reported to Bakelite. Deli remained an officer of the Autopoint Company until his death in 1946. Bakelite did not integrate Autopoint into its organization but operated Autopoint as a separate company. The Autopoint trademark (No. 125,149) was registered by Keeran on April 15, 1919. The trademark was used by the Autopoint Company in Chicago from the 1920s to the 1970s. It is now used by Autopoint, Inc., in Janesville, Wisconsin. In 1951, the Cory Corporation, a Chicago company, bought Autopoint from Union Carbide which had acquired Bakelite in 1939. Cory operated Autopoint as a division appointing the president. In the 1950s, Julius Lederer served as president of Autopoint. Autopoint was a job shop preparing advertising pencils for many different companies. In the 1950s and 1960s, their product line also included a number of other plastic desk top accessories. In the 1967, the Hershey Chocolate Corporation bought the Cory Corporation. A few years later, Hershey sold Autopoint to Gillette which merged it with its Papermate division. Gillette dismantled the Autopoint sales organization, sold the Autopoint plant in Chicago, sold or discontinued much of its product line, and greatly reduced the number of models of pencils produced. The pencils that Gillette continued to produce were reengineered to allow more interchangeability of parts between the different models of pencils. Around 1980, Gillette sold the Autopoint name and machinery to produce Autopoint pencils to a group of business men from Janesville, Wisconsin. They founded Autopoint Inc. which continues to manufacture and sell pencils and other products under the Autopoint brand.

It is one of the five villages in Cinque Terre. Overview The cemetery within the convent Monterosso al Mare is located at the center of a small natural gulf, protected by a small artificial reef, to the east of Punta Mesco in the Riviera of La Spezia. It is the westernmost of the Cinque Terre. In the west part of the original village, beyond the hill of the Capuchins, it is the village of Fegina, natural expansion and characterized by a relatively modern tourist resort facility compared to the ancient village that is reachable through a tunnel of a few tens of meters. The local train station is located at Fegina and the beaches are relatively larger compared to the narrow cliffs that characterize the other villages of the Cinque Terre. The town is divided into two distinct parts: the old town and the new town. The two areas are divided by a single tunnel that caters to pedestrians and the very few cars in the town. The beach at Monterosso runs along most of the coast line and is well used by tourists and locals. The beach is the only extensive sand beach in the Cinque Terre. Monterosso is a small town overrun by tourists in the summer months. The village was briefly excluded from the Cinque Terre trail in 1948, but was re- introduced in mid-1949. Italian officials considered the village too large to be considered part of the historic trail.  Crops  The area is famous for its many lemon trees that can be seen throughout Monterosso. It is also renowned for its white wines, grapes, and olives.  History  In 1870, the Italian government built a railroad line into the city, which opened it up to the outside world. It is the main way in which people enter the city. During World War II, many young men from the Cinque Terre fought for the resistance against the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, and the subsequent Nazi German occupation of Italy.  Main sights  Monterosso Giant Street in Moterosso village In the church *The Castle, partially ruined, built by the Genoese. *The parish church of St. John the Baptist (1282-1307). Its fa√ßade features four small marble columns and a main portal surmounted by a fresco portraying the baptism of Christ. The building is of a basilica-type plan that includes a nave and two aisles. The square medieval bell tower is crowned by merlons. *The convent of Monterosso al Mare. The convent is visible from all parts of the Cinque Terre and is a prime attraction for tourists, thanks to its historical and artistic treasures. They are reminiscent of the 1600 building in Capuchin style, with the altar and choir in wood. Among its works of art is a \\"Crucifixion\\", attributed to Van Dyck and \\"Saint Girolamo the penitent\\" by Luca Cambiaso. The refectory with its vaulted ceiling features Strozzi‚Äôs \\"Veronica\\". The convent has maintained the characteristics typical of the time of its origins, in addition to the sublime view invites contemplation. *The beach *Monterosso Giant  Monterosso giant  In Monterosso, near the beach of Fegina, is the statue of the Giant/Neptune created by the Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi (the favourite artist of Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio) and the architect Francesco Levacher. In the past, the impressive fourteen-metre high sculpture stood on the promontory as part of the decoration of the luxurious Villa Pastine (built in the early 1900s). In addition to the trident, Neptune bore a gigantic shell on his head, which acted as the terrace of the villa. During World War II, Monterosso was bombed by allied forces, and the Neptune statue (along with the villa) suffered serious damage. It was damaged even further by heavy seas in 1966.  Village life  Historically, many of the villages on the Mediterranean were walled to protect against attacks from the sea. This area of the coast was often attacked by pirates.  Accessibility  Originally, the village was only accessible by sea or by mule paths that connected the villages of the Cinque Terre and to Via Roma, the main road that connected all of Italy to Rome. These mule paths have been maintained and used over the centuries and now provide hikers with a more intimate view of the sea-swept Cinque Terre. The area was recently designated as part of the national park system and is considered a protected area, to the effect of limited development and resource usage. The Cinque Terre hiking trails have been taken over by the national park system and there is now a fee to hike on all portions of the trail. Today, the best way to go to Monterosso is to take local trains from La Spezia or Genoa or Intercity trains from Milan, Rome, Turin, and Tuscany. The village is connected to the E80 highway via a narrow, steep and winding long road. The train network reaches the other villages of Cinque Terre as well.

Local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganization of 1 April 1974, which resulted from the Local Government Act 1972. This parish forms an electoral ward in itself. Hitherto, the parish had formed part of Boston Rural District, in the Parts of Holland. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the Local Government Act of 1888, Holland had been in most respects, a county in itself. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 6,835. The origin of the place-name is from the Old Norse word toft meaning a building site or a curtilage. The addition of Fish in the 15th century may be a family name or may indicate a connection with fishing. The place-name appears as Toft in the Domesday Book of 1086 and as Fishtoft in 1416. The parish lies along the north-east side of The Haven and accommodates the Pilgrim Fathers Memorial at Scotia Creek. Fishtoft comprises three aspects ‚Äì open countryside, the village of Fishtoft, and suburban overspill from Boston. The fields along Burton Croft Road are bounded by dykes which are a home to water voles (an endangered species in the United Kingdom ‚Äì Fishtoft is one of only 181 sites where voles can still be found). Fishtoft has a school, an Anglican church, a shop (at Hawthorn Tree Corner), and football and cricket clubs. The parish church is dedicated to the Saxon saint St Guthlac. The stonework contains traces of Norman work. There is a reference to the church in the Domesday Book. The 18th-century Reading Room, a red brick building just off Rectory Close, is now a private house ‚Äì it was for many decades used as a centre of learning and education. The historic centre of the village was formerly an island in the tidal marshes ‚Äì one of a series of islands around the coast of The Wash (each one marked by a medieval church). The parishes along the coast of the Wash had no eastern boundaries, and were continually expanding as new land was reclaimed from the tidal marshes. The marshes produced methane gas which spontaneously ignited to produce flares, giving rise to the belief that they were haunted by spirits and that the new land needed cleansing before it was safe to use. This may account for the veneration of St Guthlac at Fishtoft, the saint being renowned for driving out devils; a medieval statue of St Guthlac can be seen high up on the tower of the Fishtoft parish church, and formerly held the whip with which he cleansed the land of evil spirits. The statue of St Guthlac set into the west tower is of considerable interest. Nikolaus Pevsner, in his volume on Lincolnshire (Buildings of England series) says that it is older than the fabric of the tower. It is possible that this is the original statue of the Guthlac cult, and would have been located inside the chancel. As well as the parish church of St Guthlac there was a priory \\"cell\\" (or small religious house) on the site of what is now Stoke Priory house on the corner of Gaysfield Road; some remains of the priory cell could be seen in the garden of the house until recently. There was also a small medieval wayside chapel on the western side of Church Green Road, the site indicated by a significant elevation of ground just north of the bungalow opposite The Grange. In addition, the ground at the corner of Clampgate Road and Burton Croft Road, in what is now an open field, formerly held a substantial medieval building, possibly a manor house, called Panels (or Panals) which included a chapel. The arrangement of religious buildings in medieval Fishtoft has given rise to speculation that the village may have been the centre of a cult of St Guthlac based on what is now the parish church, the monks of the priory cell helping to minister to the cult, and the wayside chapel in Church Green Road acting as a \\"slipper chapel\\" for pilgrims approaching the village along the permanent road from Boston. The feast of St Guthlac is held on 11 April. The Rochford Tower Some evidence of a Roman settlement has been found in the area. There was also an important Anglo-Saxon settlement in the area, confirmed by an excavation on what is now Saxon Gardens. At one stage there was a separate hamlet in the parish called Fenne, in the area that later contained the Ball House Inn, Rochford Tower and Hawthorn Tree Corner. This area formed almost a separate community in the 1950s with its own community hall. An important feature of the parish is the Hobhole Drain, constructed in the 19th century for land drainage purposes, which enters the River Witham near the Pilgrim Fathers Memorial. The water tower that formerly stood at the end of Cut End Road has recently been demolished ‚Äì it was an exact copy of the water tower that still stands in Sutterton.

He was said to have served in the state of Shu Han as a military general. In folklore and literature Little is known about Guan Suo, as many tales about him were passed down in the form of folk culture instead of textual works. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Guan Suo was described as a capable warrior, and was involved in Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign against the Nanman. Guan Suo was very popular among the girls because of his handsome appearance. In a Chinese opera play, Guan Suo Play (ÈóúÁ¥¢Êà≤), he was described as a man \\"seven chi tall, with a face like a peach blossom\\" (Ë∫´Èï∑‰∏ÉÂ∞∫ÔºåÈù¢‰ººÊ°ÉËä±). In some stories, he has many wives.

Fyodor Rokotov was born into a family of peasant serfs, belonging to the Repnins. Much in his biography is obscure. He studied art in Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts. After buying back his freedom at the end of the 1750s he became established as a fashionable painter. In 1765, Rokotov was elected an Academician, but he did not work as a professor in the Academy long, because it interfered with his painting. He returned to Moscow in 1765, where he lived for the rest of his life. He had a lot of commissions there, becoming one of the best portrait painters of his time. Among his best-known portraits are Portrait of Alexandra Struyskaya (1772), sometimes called the Russian Mona Lisa and admittedly the most celebrated piece of the 18th-century Russian painting; Portrait of Countess Elisabeth Santi (1785), and Lady in a Pink Dress (1770s, illustration, right). Rokotov avoided painting formal portraits with much adornment and decoration. Instead he was one of the first Russian painters advancing a psychological portrait with attention to optical and atmospheric effects.

It is a rich, well textured array of characters, influenced from a broad spectrum of history, myths, classic literature, and the world of comics itself (both real and fictitious). Heroes *Air Ace - A flying hero active in the wake of World War I; the earliest superhero publicly active in what became Astro City, and so considered its first \\"real\\" superhero. *The All-American ‚Äî A hero of the 1940s and 1950s who wore stylized football gear; like many golden age heroes, he had no superpowers and based his attire and paraphernalia on a theme. Retired in 1959. Rumored to have been killed by a sniper's bullet during the Korean War. *Alligator - A young outcast hero active in the 1970s; a monster from the sewers recruited by Bravo to become one of the original members of the Astro City Irregulars in the early to mid-1970s. *Altar Boy (Brian Kinney) (viewpoint) - The Confessor's sidekick; becomes the second Confessor after his mentor sacrifices himself to expose an alien invasion. *American Chibi - anime/manga inspired young heroine. *Aquarina (Renata Delamare) - Water-themed member of The Apollo Eleven; romantically linked to Kahoutek. *Arthro (Simon McCaleb) - Arthropod-themed member of The Apollo Eleven; romantically linked to Gas Giant. *Assemblyman II (Ken) - heroic successor to the previous Assemblyman. Member of the Honor Guard circa 2013. *Astra Furst (viewpoint) - A young adventurer/hero able to transform into energy and fly. Daughter of Rex and Natalie Furst, born in 1986. A member of the First Family. Almost singlehandedly defeated the Silver Brain in 1996. *The Astro-Naut - A hero of the 1930s and 1940s, active in World War II. Astro City was renamed (from Romeyn Falls) in his honor after he gave his life to save it from an alien invasion. *Atomicus (featured) - A nuclear-powered being from another world who was active in the 1960s. Left Earth because of his girlfriend's determination to prove his identity. *Augustus Furst (featured) ‚Äì A brilliant scientist/adventurer active from the 1950s through the present. Brother of Julius Furst and adoptive father of Nick and Natalie. Leader of the First Family. *Barrier ‚Äì Australian hero who helped rally other Australian heroes in Canberra against the Enelsians. Only mentioned, not seen. *Beautie - A powerful android and a current member of the Honor Guard. Beautie was constructed by the brilliant daughter of a supervillain genius but is unable to recall her past. She periodically investigates her origins and visits her creator, who invariably orders her to again forget her origins and depart. *The Black Badge (K.O. Carson) (featured) - An urban hero active from the 1950s until 1972, when he retired and opened the superhero bar Bruiser's, which he currently owns and operates under his civilian name. *The Black Rapier - A detective-themed hero based in New Orleans who wields an electric sword and wears a modified fencing outfit. Former leader of the Honor Guard. Recently retired. *Black Velvet - A mysterious woman with shadow-like powers and a grim demeanor. Became the partner of the Street Angel. Apparently killed by the time-traveling Silver Agent after her powers went out of control. *The Blue Knight (Josh -----)(featured) - A gun-toting vigilante who wears a police-style riot mask with a ghostly skull outlined by a blue glow for a face. He takes very direct, very violent action against the criminals that he hunts, usually killing rather than capturing them. A frightening crime-fighter who stalks quietly and delivers justice from the barrel of a gun. Active from 1972 to the early 1980s, and a representative example of the type of violent, vengeance-driven hero that emerged during that period. Rumors abound about his current status, but no definitive sighting has occurred since 1988. Possible successors - the Blue Knights - were active during the early to mid-1980s. *The Bouncing Beatnik - Fourth in a succession of counter-cultural heroes, all incarnations of the same being. Previously incarnated as Zootsuit and afterwards as the Halcyon Hippie. He was active in the 1950s and early 1960s. An early and frequent ally of the Honor Guard, although he never formally joined the team; Leopardman and much of the public considered him unduly frivolous. *Bravo (surname Ruiz) - An originally Los Angeles-based hero who started out as el Hombre's sidekick in the early 1970s and struck out on his own after his patron's disgrace, moving to Astro City and founding the Astro City Irregulars. Now retired as a superhero, he serves as Detective Ruiz on the Astro City's police force, and apparently long remained the secret patron of the group he founded. *Broadsword - A sword-wielding vigilante active in the mid-1980s, and a representative example of the type of violent, vengeance- driven hero that emerged during that period. *The Broken Man (viewpoint) ‚Äì Eighth in a succession of counter-cultural heroes, all incarnations of the same being. Reintegrated in the 1980s after being \\"shattered\\" during the interrupted transition between his sixth and seventh incarnations (Glamorex and an essentially stillborn punk hero). Broken again in a subsequent confrontation with his nemesis, the Oubor, he physically returned in a different form as a minimally functional madman, while continuing to manifest psychically in his Broken Man form. Symptoms of his condition include apparent brain damage that leaves him unable to connect with music (formerly a wellspring of his power) or communicate effectively with most people, who hear his speech as gibberish. Those to whom he manifests are usually unable to perceive or remember him after a few seconds, apparently due to the Oubor‚Äôs influence. The Broken Man has been observing Astro City and related characters for decades, and more recently has reached beyond the fourth wall to enlist the readers of the Astro city comic book in his efforts to bring down the Oubor. *Cleopatra - A magical heroine whose primary weapon is a mystical staff. The name and staff have been borne by two women in succession, the second of whom is also super-strong. The first Cleopatra was a founding member of the Honor Guard in the late 1950s who fought Steeljack in the early 1970s; the current version is also a member. Exact details of their powers and origins have yet to be revealed, but they seem inspired by the heritage of Classical antiquity. *The Cloak of Night ‚Äì A shadowy Prohibition era hero who fought against bootleggers and racketeers. Described as often vanishing without a trace and is rumored to have been a vigilante who didn't have quarrels with killing. His eyepieces, surviving as an artifact, are said to be capable of identifying people in imminent peril of death; this quality was recently confirmed by Steeljack. *Commander One (Andrew Garrison) - Fully spacesuited, jetpacked leader of The Apollo Eleven. *Commando K - A hero or hero group of the 1940s and 1950s, believed lost near Pyongyang during the Korean War, during which the All-American was killed. Possible connection to the All-American's sidekick, Slugger the Junior Dynamo. *The Confessor (featured) - The first Confessor was Jeremiah Parrish, originally a nineteenth-century Catholic priest who came to what became Astro City in 1869 to help Cardinal Grandenetti build Grandenetti Cathedral. Given administrative duties, including the importation of materials and dealing with immigrant workers from Eastern Europe, he was killed by a vampire, becoming a vampire himself. Fighting his hunger for blood he resorted to study, and after his discovery, to seclusion for decades. Inspired by the example of Air Ace and other early public superheroes, he eventually became one himself, apparently in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Despite his lengthy career, no photos of him existed, although few if any members of the public realized this was due to his vampiric nature. Active into the mid-1990s, when he sacrificed himself to expose the Enelsian invasion, revealing himself as a vampire in the process. A patron of Butler's in civilian guise. A few years after his death, his apprentice Altar Boy (Brian Kinney) became the second Confessor, allowing the underworld to believe that he is Parrish, which prompts them to react with anti-vampire measures which are useless against the strictly mortal Kinney. *Coyotl - Native American hero combining human and coyote attributes, pre- dating European settlement active in the area that would in time become Astro City. Used a bow and arrows. Possibly empowered by the magic amulet that later created Stormhawk and G-Dog. *Crackerjack (featured) - An egocentric and reckless blowhard with amazing agility and a staff weapon. Active since 1991. he reflects the disconnect that frequently existed between superheroes' sterling public personas and unappealing private behavior. Possessing no super-powers, he is dedicated to his superhero career to the point of obsession, to the extent of refusing to allow increasing human limitations to curtail his activities. Recently retired by age and debilitating injuries; his lover Quarrel (II) has taken charge of his physical rehabilitation, much as he took charge of hers earlier in their relationship. *Dame Progress - A \\"steampunk\\" heroine who operated out of Romeyn Falls around the very end of the 19th century. *Daniel (featured) - A religious hero, leonine in appearance. Trained as a healer. Former member of the Crossbreed. Started a church in Minnesota. *David (featured) - A gigantic religious hero. Former member of the Crossbreed. *Dr. Monkey ‚Äì Animal hero given super-intelligence during a lab accident. Flies using a specially designed vehicle. Leader of the Pet Patrol. *Encephalon (Leonard Vindari) - Brain-and-tentacle-themed member of The Apollo Eleven. *\\"Energy\\" Brown - A female prostitute turned vigilante with energy powers. Active in the 1970s. *The Flying Fox (Samantha Cronin) (featured) ‚Äî A non-powered crimefighter who uses an aero-cycle for transportation; rumored to be a lesbian and is in fact openly gay in her civilian life. Somewhat ironically, her mother was also involved with the '60s superhero Atomicus, and was responsible for his abandoning Earth. Is the second hero to use the name. *The Frontiersman - A hero of the 1950s who dressed like Davy Crockett in a domino mask, smoked, and appeared in Frontiers cigarette advertisements. Active as late as 1959. Apparently died of lung cancer. *Gas Giant (Robin Carruthers) - Enormous, gaseous member of The Apollo Eleven - romantically linked to Arthro. *G-Dog ‚Äì The combination of Hank (a corgi) and Andy (a man) through the agency of the magic amulet that previously created Stormhawk. *The Gentleman - A tuxedo-clad and scrupulously polite hero active since the 1940s, pre-dating the city's name change, super-strong and capable of flight. *Ghost Ferret ‚Äì Animal hero; member of the Pet Patrol. *Glamorex - Sixth in a succession of counter-cultural heroes, all incarnations of the same being. An androgynous hero active in the late 1970s. Previously incarnated as the Halcyon Hippie. ‚ÄúShattered‚Äù during an interrupted transition to a seventh incarnation, a punk hero, and later reintegrated as the Broken Man. *Grimoire - An assistant, servant or student of Simon Magus. Wrote a book about their relationship and struck out on her own after his disappearance. *The Halcyon Hippie - Fifth in a succession of counter-cultural heroes, all incarnations of the same being. He was active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Previously incarnated as the Bouncing Beatnik and afterwards as Glamorex. *The Hanged Man (featured) - A ghostly figure who protects Shadow Hill. He appears to be a jet-black corpse with a burlap sack over his head and a noose around his neck. Invariably seen as a floating apparition, usually human-scaled, although it can also expand to great heights. His specific powers are unknown, but appear to include a kind of empathy that guides him to those in need of comfort after traumatic events. Active since at least the 19th century; rumored to have existed since the Middle Ages. *Hawk of the Alleyways - Costumed vigilante active in the 1920s. *Hellhound (M/Sgt. Harvard Amos Chester, USMC) - A Vietnam War veteran transformed into a monster by black magic, active from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s. *El Hombre (\\"The Man\\" in Spanish) (Esteban Rodriguez) - An urban hero active in Los Angeles in the 1960s and early 1970s. A member of the Honor Guard and partner of Bravo. Disgraced in April 1973 by the misfire of a crisis he manufactured to restore his fading reputation, he became a recluse haunted by his failure and eventually declined into insanity. In 1998, intending to reprise his earlier scheme in order to relaunch his heroic career in the new guise of el Guerrerro, he masqueraded as the villainous Conquistador and incidentally became the Black Mask Killer. *Homegirl - A young outcast hero, a flying knife-fighter. A current member of the Astro City Irregulars. Formerly known as Jailbait. *Hummingbird - A member of the Honor Guard. She fell in love with Deven, a wizard from a secret magical land called Khapak Iqun, the two producing a daughter named Amanda. Deven had to leave with his people but as a parting gift, his pantheon of gods blessed Amanda with great abilities of flight and a sonic cry. With help from the Honor Guard, Hummingbird raised her daughter to learn her talents and become the new Hummingbird. Recently, Amanda learned that a curse from a vengeful spirit will transform her into a full bird creature. Offered the chance to stop it by giving up all her powers, she instead decides to keep them and continue to be a heroine. *Ichthyos (Xi Lun Chu) - Armored, marine-life-themed member of The Apollo Eleven. *Ironhorse, the Human Locomotive - Apparently a steam-powered human-machine hybrid who became active in 1862, \\"give or take a decade,\\" and is still extant, though apparently retired. *Jack-in-the-Box (viewpoint) - A bouncy clown-themed vigilante with no real powers but amazing agility and an arsenal of similarly themed weaponry and amazing agility. The role has been taken by three different men: the first, Jack Johnson, active from 1964 to 1983 (when he died); the second, his son Zachary Johnson, active from 1989 through the mid-1990s; and the third, Zachary's prot√©g√© Roscoe James, active thereafter. The first Jack-in-the-Box fought Steeljack in the early 1970s. The second is known to have patronized Butler's. *Jazz Baby - Second in a succession of counter-cultural heroes, all incarnations of the same being.

The couple were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina living in the city of Sarajevo. She was a Bosniak, and he a Bosnian Serb.TRANSCRIPTS:Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo They were killed by sniper fire on 19 May 1993, while trying to cross the Vrbanja bridge to the Serb-occupied territory of Grbavica. Mark H. Milstein's photograph of their dead bodies were used by numerous media outlets, and a Reuters dispatch about them was filed by Kurt Schork. The documentary was co-produced by PBS's Frontline, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Film Board of Canada and WDR Germany. It was directed by John Zaritsky. Synopsis The 1992‚Äì96 Siege of Sarajevo by the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS), caused living conditions to deteriorate drastically for its inhabitants and, in 1993, the couple decided to flee the city. Having friends on all sides involved in the conflict, there was a general thought that their passage through the city and its infamous Sniper Alley, under constant fire from hills occupied by the Serbs, could be a safe one. An arrangement was made for 19 May 1993 at 17:00 CEST (GMT +02:00) that no one would fire as the couple approached. According to Dino Kapin, who was a Commander of a Croatian unit allied at the time with Bosnian Army forces, around 17:00 hours, a man and a woman were seen approaching the bridge. As soon as they were at the foot of the bridge, a shot was heard, and according to all sides involved in their passage, the bullet hit Bo≈°ko Brkiƒá and killed him instantly. Another shot was heard and the woman screamed, fell down wounded, but was not killed. She crawled over to her boyfriend, embraced him, hugged him, and died. It was observed that she was alive for at least 15 minutes after the shooting. Mark H. Milstein, the American photojournalist who made the haunting image of Admira and Bo≈°ko which gave birth to Kurt Schork's article, recalled in an interview that \\"the morning of May 19, 1993 had been pretty much a bust\\" for him as far as making photos were concerned: \\"Excessive Bosnian Army bureaucracy had kept us away from the front line. After lunch, I hooked up with Japanese freelance TV cameraman and a Washington Times journalist. Together, we cruised the city looking for something different. Everywhere we went in Sarajevo ended in frustration. Before calling it a day, however, we decided to check out the front-line around the Vrbanja Bridge. There was a small battle going on, with Bosnian forces firing at a group of Serb soldiers near the ruins of the Union Invest building. Suddenly, a Serb tank appeared 200 meters in front of us, and fired over our heads. We scrambled to the next apartment house, and found ourselves holed up with a group of Bosnian soldiers. One of the soldiers yelled at me to look out the window, pointing at a young girl and boy running on the far side of the bridge. I grabbed my camera, but it was too late. The boy and girl were shot down. Bosniak Admira Ismiƒá and Bosnian Serb Bo≈°ko Brkiƒá, both 25. Their bodies remained in the no man's land for nearly four days before being recovered. I made two frames and afterwards, not knowing who they were or recognizing the significance of the event, returned to the Holiday Inn (where most journalists were headquartered) to develop my film. Later that night I told Kurt Schork what I had seen, and together with his translator began piecing together the information that would eventually result in the news story.\\" Michael Hedges, the Washington Times reporter who was with Milstein that day, said \\"A Bosnian soldier motioned for me to look down and to the left, by the bridge. The couple lay together. It appeared they had been shot some time earlier, but I couldn't say whether it was minutes or hours earlier. I went back to the Holiday Inn and wrote an article that was published the next day in the Washington Times. That story, which began with an account of the deaths at the bridge, made it clear we had no idea which side had done the killing, that we only had the Bosnian soldiers' word that it was Serb snipers. That evening, Kurt Schork came to my room, said he had seen Milstein's photos, and asked what I had seen. I showed him a copy of my article, and confirmed the location of the killings. The next day, he developed much more of the story, and through his work it became a symbol of the senseless violence as well as a tale that captured people's imagination.\\" To this date, it is not known with certainty who fired the shots. The bodies of Admira and Bo≈°ko lay on the bridge for days since no one dared to enter the Sniper Alley, a no man's land, and recover them. As the bodies lay on the bridge, the Serbs and Bosnian armies argued over who killed the couple and who would ultimately take the responsibility for the killing. After eight days, the bodies were recovered by Serb forces in the middle of the night. However, it was later revealed that the VRS forced Bosnian POWs to go there in the middle of the night and recover the bodies. The two are now buried together, side by side in Lion Cemetery, surrounded by thousands of other victims from the siege of Sarajevo. Awards For this film, director Zaritsky received the Alfred Dupont Award from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism as well as an Emmy Award nomination.

It spans the Balsas River (known locally as the Mezcala River) close to the western Pacific coast of the country. This bridge, with a total length of and six uneven spans completed in 1993, has been in service since 1994 as a toll bridge. It was the world's tallest bridge from its opening in 1993 to 1998 when the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan was opened. It was also the highest bridge in Mexico and the second highest multiple cable-stayed bridge to be built in the world. The Mezcala Bridge was built as part of the 1989‚Äì1994 highway restructuring program in Mexico, which reduced the distance of Highway 95 between Cuernavaca and Acapulco by 49 km. The bridge suffered a fire in one of its cable systems in March 2007 when there was an accident on the main deck. The fire resulted when a coconut-carrying truck collided with two school buses. The bridge was only partially closed until the damaged cable was replaced. History A new national highway program was initiated in Mexico between 1989 and 1994. Under this program, the federal highway \\"Cuernavaca - Acapulco\\", also called the \\"Route of the Sun\\", was proposed to be re-routed to reduce the distance, as well as travel time. A new planned route of length was drawn which reduced the distance by between Cuernavaca and Acapulco, and also reduced the travel time between M√©xico City and the port of Acapulco to about 3.5 hours. This rerouting of the highway, however, required crossing of the Balsas River (also known as the Mezcala River) at a location ( from Cuernavaca where the river width from bank to bank varied from . The hill slopes on the banks were also found to be steep. Consequently, the Mezcala bridge was planned and designed to cross high over the river. This bridge is also known by the name \\"Mezcala-Solidaridad\\" bridge. In 2010, as part of Mexico's celebrations for its bicentennial, a series of roads were deemed to be part of \\"Ruta 2010\\", that commemorated various paths taken during military campaigns. Highway 95 was a part of the path called \\"The Sentiments of the Nation Route\\", which included the connection between Mexico City and Acapulco. The route commemorated a military campaign led by Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. Design features The innovative overall concept of this bridge featured four adjacent main spans sustained by three consecutive harps of cable stays attached to three tall towers, with the central tower being the central main pylon (pier) of in height. The overall design was by Mexican engineer Modesto Armijo, head of the Mexican company \\"COMEC SA\\", for the account of the federal Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes (Secretariat of Communications and Transportation). The detailed design was also achieved by Modesto Armijo and Alain Chauvin from \\"COMEC, S.A.\\". While COMEC did the structural engineering design, the engineering designs were checked by EEG Europe Etudes Gecti and the cables were supplied by Freyssinet International. The calculation of the static and dynamic effects of turbulent wind on the bridge, when in service and under construction, was carried out using the \\"Scanner\\" computer program, taking into account the aerodynamic measurements made at the Carmel West Wind Laboratory (J. Raggett) on a model of the bridge deck, with the help of Pr Scanlan. Careful studies of the behavior of this bridge under seismic conditions were also carried out using the same computer program. The valley over which the bridge passes is approximately deep. The bridge consists of six spans, with lengths of the spans in the following order: , , , , , and , for a total length of . =Construction material= The bridge is categorized as a cable-stayed bridge, and has H-pylon supports with semi-fan arrangement. The piers of the bridge were constructed with reinforced cement concrete. Both the superstructure and the cable are made of steel. Cable supported concrete pylon was adopted due to high seismic conditions of the area. Failure event The multispan stayed or cable bridge suffered damages to one of the stay cables with a minor damage to an adjoining cable during a fire that was created due to an accident on March 17, 2007 between two school buses and a truck at the middle span of the bridge. The truck was carrying coconuts, which was the reason for the fire. After closing the bridge for vehicular traffic temporarily, the cable was replaced; though traffic was partially restored when the cable replacement started. Analysis of the cause of the fire by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the China Communications and Transportation Association indicated that the High-density polyethylene (HDPE) sheathing, which has hydrocarbon composition, was not ideally fire resistant as it caught fire and created the additional fire load which resulted in snapping of one cable line. A moot question that was posed in the analysis was \\"would this bridge have survived the loss of two or three adjacent cables?\\" Analysis also showed that multiple cables could be included in a fire caused by a lightning strike. Bridge designers have examined the lacunae in design of major long span bridges of various types in the world, keeping in view the failures that have occurred in many bridges including the limited failure of the cable of the Mezcala Bridge due to a single point loading event that occurred due to a fire. This study was done with the objective \\"to enhance the reliability and safety of these major structures in the built environment.\\" The approach now under consideration for cable stayed bridge is \\"a more rational approach from assigning factors of safety to key elements such as suspenders and stay cables, to setting depth and stiffness requirements.\\" See also *List of tallest bridges in the world References Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Mexico Category:Bridges completed in 1993 Category:Buildings and structures in Guerrero Category:Transportation in Guerrero Category:Toll bridges in Mexico ","title":"Mezcala Bridge"},{"id":"2354465","text":"Team Jumbo‚ÄìVisma is a Dutch men's professional bicycle racing team, successor of the former Rabobank. The team consists of three sections: ProTeam (the UCI WorldTeam team), Continental (a talent team racing in the UCI Europe Tour), and Cyclo-cross. The cycling team was founded for the 1984 season under the name Kwantum‚ÄìDecosol, anchored by Jan Raas, with mostly cyclists coming from the TI‚ÄìRaleigh cycling team. With Raas as directeur sportif from 1985 onwards, the head sponsor was succeeded by Superconfex, Buckler, Wordperfect and Novell, respectively, before Raas signed a contract with Rabobank, a Dutch association of credit unions, in 1996. After Rabobank sponsorship ended in 2012, it was known as Blanco, Belkin, and then Lotto-Jumbo. Since 1984, the team has entered every Tour de France and since the introduction of divisions in 1998, the team has always been in the first division. A 2012 investigation by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant concluded that doping was at least tolerated, from the team's 1996 beginnings as Rabobank until at least 2007. History In road bicycle racing, teams usually take their names from their main sponsors. Team Jumbo‚ÄìVisma has previously had the following sponsors, and thus names. =Kwantum‚ÄìDecosol‚ÄìYoko (1984‚Äì1986)= After the season of 1983, the TI‚ÄìRaleigh team split up because of tension between former world champion Jan Raas and team leader Peter Post, with seven cyclists following Post to the new Panasonic-team and six cyclists joining Raas to the Kwantum team. The team captains of the Kwantum team were Guillaume Driessens, Jan Gisbers and Walter Godefroot. In their first year, the team managed to win the intermediate sprints classification and one stage in the 1984 Tour de France, the Amstel Gold Race and the Dutch national road championship. After the 1984 season, Jan Raas stopped as an active cyclist and became team manager. In 1985 the Kwantum team had a successful year. Victories included two Tour de France stages, the Tour of Luxembourg, Paris‚ÄìTours, Paris‚ÄìBrussels, the Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, the Tour of Belgium, again the Dutch national road championship, and the World cycling championship (Joop Zoetemelk). 1986 was less successful; the most important victory was Tour of Belgium. =Superconfex‚ÄìYoko‚ÄìColnago (1987‚Äì1989)= For the 1987 season, the main sponsor became Superconfex. In that year, the team was officially known as Superconfex ‚Äì Kwantum ‚Äì Yoko ‚Äì Colnago. Jan Raas remained the team leader. After a victory in Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne for Ludo Peeters, the new sprinter Jean-Paul van Poppel (coming from the Skala cycling team) gave the team a great year, with three stage wins in the Tour de France (of which two for van Poppel) and the victory in the points classification in the Tour de France for Jean-Paul van Poppel. Joop Zoetemelk ended his career with a victory in the Amstel Gold Race. From 1988 on, the team was known as Superconfex ‚Äì Yoko ‚Äì Opel ‚Äì Colnago. 1988 was also a successful season for the team, with victories in Paris‚ÄìBrussels, the Tour of Ireland, the Tour of Belgium, the Amstel Gold Race, and six stages in the Tour de France. In the 1989 season, Jean-Paul van Poppel changed to the Panasonic team. In 1989 his sprinting capacities were missed, and the number of victories was reduced. Still, Paris‚ÄìBrussels, the Tour of Flanders and Paris‚ÄìTours were won, together with two stages in the 1989 Tour de France. =Buckler‚ÄìColnago‚ÄìDecca (1990‚Äì1992)= A Buckler jersey After the 1989 season, the main sponsoring was taken over by Buckler. The Tour of Belgium was won again, and the Ronde van Nederland was won as well. That year, the team had the winner of the Dutch national road race championships again, as Peter Winnen won the race. In 1991, the team won the Amstel Gold Race, the Ronde van Nederland and Tour of Flanders. The team had taken over Steven Rooks from the Panasonic team, who immediately became the Dutch national road race champion. The worst year in the team's history was 1992. Only 26 races were won in the season, compared to 64 victories in the successful 1988 season. 1992 also saw a young Erik Dekker entering the team. After that season, Buckler decided to stop sponsoring. =Wordperfect‚ÄìColnago‚ÄìDecca (1993‚Äì1994)= Ra√∫l Alcal√° with Wordperfect in 1993 A new sponsor was found in WordPerfect. Steven Rooks left the team, Ra√∫l Alcal√° joined the team. Still, the 1993 season did not turn out a great season, with only 29 victories, the most important being Three Days of De Panne and the Tour DuPont. In 1993 and 1994, Michael Boogerd and Leon van Bon started their professional career in the team, and Viatcheslav Ekimov also came. The Tour du Pont was won again, together with the Tour of Luxembourg. The year still was disappointing with only 25 victories. =Novell‚ÄìDecca (1995)= In 1995, the team was joined by Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, the winner of the points classification in the 1994 Tour de France. Abdoujaparov won one stage in the Tour de France, but other than that, the year was still not what the sponsors had hoped, so a new sponsor had to be found. The title sponsor of the previous two years, WordPerfect, was a product of Novell Software, which carried the team's name this one season. =Rabobank (1996‚Äì2012)= Erik Dekker at the 2005 Tour de France Raas became the team manager of the Rabobank team while Theo de Rooy, Adrie van Houwelingen and Zoetemelk were directeur sportifs. As a Dutch cycling team, the team signed many of the prominent Dutch cyclists of the 1990s including Adrie van der Poel, Richard Groenendaal and Erik Breukink as well as keeping the prominent Dutch cyclists from the Novell team that included Leon van Bon, Erik Dekker and Michael Boogerd. In addition, the team had many successful cyclists of other nationalities such as Edwig van Hooydonck, Rolf S√∏rensen, Johan Bruyneel and Robbie McEwen. The Rabobank team dominated the Dutch national championships over several disciplines, and had world champions in both cyclo-cross (Adrie van der Poel in 1996, Richard Groenendaal in 2000 and Sven Nys in 2004) and road racing (√ìscar Freire in 2004). In the 2000 cyclo-cross world championships there was a conflict between the commercial team interests and the national team interests. Groenendaal attacked during the first lap and was chased by defending cyclo- cross world champion Mario De Clercq who was followed by Groenendaal's Rabobank teammate Sven Nys. Team manager Jan Raas allegedly told Nys not to cooperate in the chase and De Clercq was unable to catch Groenendaal. Nys received much criticism from the Belgian team manager Erik De Vlaeminck as well as the Belgian public. The Rabobank team during the 2005 Rund um den Henninger Turm race Jan Raas was the team manager for the first eight years of the team's existence. In 2003 Raas was removed rather abruptly which surprised the other members of staff including Theo De Rooy, Erik Dekker and Michael Boogerd. De Rooy was promoted to team manager and a former Rabobank rider, who had been working as a PR man for Rabobank, Erik Breukink, was named as the new directeur sportif to replace De Rooy. In August 2007 in the aftermath of the affair in which Michael Rasmussen was removed during the 2007 Tour de France, De Rooy resigned from his position as team manager. Following the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report on doping in professional cycling in October 2012, Rabobank announced it would end its sponsorship of professional cycling at the end of 2012. Rabobank said that doping was so rampant that it was \\"no longer convinced the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport.\\" =Blanco then Belkin (2013‚Äì2014)= Mark Renshaw for Belkin in 2013 The team was able to continue, as Rabobank agreed to fund the team during 2013 until a new sponsor could be found. The deadline for finding new sponsorship was the end of the 2013 UCI World Tour. Racing under the name Blanco to refer to its formally unsponsored status, Tom-Jelte Slagter of the team won its first stage race, the 2013 Tour Down Under. Belkin was announced as the team's new sponsor in June 2013 with a -year deal, however in June 2014 they announced that they were exercising a clause in their contract to end their sponsorship of the team at the end of the 2014 season, forcing the team to find a new backer for the second time in 18 months. Subsequently, in July 2014 it was announced that the team had signed a formal declaration of intent with the Dutch lottery Lotto and marketing agency BrandLoyalty which would ensure their backing for two years, with an option for an additional two years. As part of the deal the cycling team would join forces with the BrandLoyalty speed skating team managed by Jac Orie and featuring Olympic and World Champions Sven Kramer and Stefan Groothuis. =LottoNL‚ÄìJumbo (2015‚Äì2018)= Team LottoNL-Jumbo leading the Peloton on the 3rd stage of Tour of Slovenia 2018, which was won by Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Team LottoNL-Jumbo) Robert Gesink for LottoNL at the 2015 Tour de Suisse In June 2014 it was announced that Belkin would stop sponsoring the cycling team. On 20 July 2014, the team announced they had an agreement in place with the Brand Loyalty skating team. A day later, the team also released the news that the Dutch Lotto will also sponsor the team. On 29 September 2014, the contracts were signed between the two teams, meaning that the new name would be TEAMLottoNL, with the renaming taking effect from 1 January 2015. On 23 October 2014, the team was unveiled in Utrecht as Team LottoNL‚ÄìJumbo showing their new black and yellow team kit. Lotto had previously been confirmed as the teams title sponsor, supermarket chain, Jumbo, was presented as the second sponsor of the WorldTour team. In September the team confirmed they would continue to ride on Bianchi bikes for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. On the first rest day of the 2016 Tour de France, the team announced LottoNL had agreed to extend their sponsorship of the team through to the end of the 2018 season. =Jumbo‚ÄìVisma (2019‚Äì)= After signing a new sponsorship deal with Visma, a Norwegian software company, the team was renamed to Team Jumbo‚ÄìVisma on 1 January 2019. Starting in 2021 they will be riding Cerv√©lo bikes.https://www.teamjumbovisma.com/news/material/team-jumbo-visma-signs- multi-year-partnership-with-cervelo/ Road racing team The road racing team has won several Classics such as the Tour of Flanders in 1997, Championship of Hamburg in 1998, the Amstel Gold Race in 1999 and 2001, Paris‚ÄìTours in 1999, 2004 and 2010, Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n in 2000 and Milan‚ÄìSan Remo in 2004, 2007 and 2010. Erik Dekker won the UCI World Cup in 2001 due to his Classic win and high placings in many of the classics. =Rabobank becoming a Grand Tour team= Rabobank team, 2004 Tour de France The team signed American Levi Leipheimer in 2002 as a rider for the Tour de France. Leipheimer finished eighth in his first Tour but crashed out of the race on the first stage of the 2003 Tour de France. Leipheimer finished ninth overall the following year. The team became more of a Grand Tour team as could be seen by Michael Rasmussen's win in the Mountains Classification of the 2005 Tour de France. When Denis Menchov took the lead in the 2005 Vuelta a Espa√±a, he was not expecting to be competing for the overall classification The Rabobank team at that year's Vuelta were not seen as particularly strong or able to assist Menchov in the mountain stages. Menchov finished second to Roberto Heras which was the highest placing of a Rabobank team rider at a grand tour after Michael Boogerd's fifth place in the 1998 Tour de France. Heras was later disqualified for doping and Menchov was made the winner. The following year Menchov focused on the Tour de France where the team rode strongly with Menchov, Boogerd, and Rasmussen. During the 2007 Tour de France, Rabobank fired Michael Rasmussen (2005 Tour de France, 2006 Tour de France K.O.M.) for code-violations while he was in the yellow jersey.Rasmussen out of Tour de France The remaining riders of the Rabobank team were given the choice to start the 17th stage without Michael Rasmussen, or to withdraw. That evening they decided to withdraw, but the team changed its mind and announced the following morning that the riders would be starting the 17th stage. Although he started with the rest of the team, Denis Menchov (team leader on the road, who deferred to Rasmussen when the latter seemed to have a better chance at winning) abandoned the race in the middle of the stage. The Rabobank team was invited for the 2008 Tour de France. Denis Menchov had decided to focus on the Tour de France. To do that, he did not defend his Vuelta a Espa√±a-title, and rode the 2008 Giro d'Italia as preparation for the Tour de France. Menchov finished 4th place in the 2008 Tour de France, and √ìscar Freire won the points classification. The team had to wait until 2009 for the first successes in the Giro d'Italia, when Denis Menchov won two stages; a mountain finish and a time trial. This second win earned him the pink leader jersey, which the team defended to the end of the race, earning Menchov, and Rabobank, their third Grand Tour GC win. Affiliated teams * Women's road team: Team Jumbo‚ÄìVisma (women's team) (current); Rabo-Liv Women Cycling Team (former) * Men's development team: Jumbo‚ÄìVisma Development Team (current); Rabobank Development Team (former) =Cyclo-cross team= The Rabobank cyclo-cross team has dominated the sport in the past with Sven Nys and Richard Groenendaal winning the General Classification competitions such as the Superprestige, the World Cup and the Gazet van Antwerpen trophy over the last eight years. Groenendaal dominated the Dutch cyclo-cross championships for many years. Groenendaal left the team after the 2006‚Äì2007 season. He was at that time one of the few remaining Rabobank riders from the 1996 team. Lars Boom joined the team in 2002 as a junior cyclo-cross rider and has already achieved success in the Elite cyclo- cross championships as well as showing promise riding in the UCI Europe Tour with the Rabobank Continental team. Sponsorship Team bus of LottoNL Jumbo during 2017 UCI Road World Championships in Bergen Mercedes - support car in 2019 Rabobank announced in October 2012 that it would end its sponsorship of professional cycling at the end of the year, with the team announcing its intention to continue as a ‚Äòwhite label‚Äô under a new foundation yet to be established. On 13 December 2012 it was announced the team would participate in 2013 under the Blanco name, with the intention to find a sponsor for 2014 or to stop the team otherwise. During the 2013 Giro d'Italia it emerged that the technology firm Belkin was a possible new sponsor. The deal was confirmed towards the end of May 2013, and the team's new identity was launched a week before the 2013 Tour de France. The team formerly rode Colnago frames but as of 1 January 2009 began a two-year contract riding Giant frames equipped with Shimano components. Starting in 2014, Bianchi supplies the team bicycles. The team began a two-year contract (2014‚Äì2016) wearing Santini SMS clothing. A deal was subsequently struck for consumer electronics company Belkin to take on sponsorship from the 2013 Tour de France until the end of 2015. In 2015 Lotto, a Dutch lottery, agreed to sponsor the Team for four years. As of 2015, the team is also sponsored by a Dutch supermarket chain, Jumbo. The \\"NL\\" was added to the team's name to differentiate it from Lotto-Soudal, a ProTeam that is sponsored by the national lottery of Belgium. In 2019, the Team began a long-term contract with a Business software provider Visma for at least five years, therefore becoming Team Jumbo‚ÄìVisma. From 2021 team will have new bicycle partnership with Cerv√©lo, ending previous sponsorship with Bianchi lasting from 2014 to 2020. Doping accusations According to a 2012 investigation by de Volkskrant, doping was used by Rabobank riders since 1998 and condoned by the team, with team physicians actively monitoring the health of those riders. According to Stefan Matschiner, a key witness in the Humanplasma scandal, three (former) Rabobank riders were customers of the Swiss blood doping expert. Matschiner mentioned Michael Boogerd, the most successful Dutch Rabobank rider, and said one other team member was a customer. Theo de Rooij, Rabo's manager since 2003 and responsible for pulling Michael Rasmussen from the 2007 Tour de France, did not deny doping was used by team riders, but said that the use of doping was neither suggested nor paid for by the team. In the 2015 USADA report against Dr. Geert Leinders, it was found that he, and other team doctors, supported and organized a blood doping program within the team for much of the 2000s, which included EPO, blood transfusions, hGH, and cortisones. Riders included in the report that doped during their Rabobank tenure include Denis Menchov, Michael Boogerd, Michael Rasmussen, and Levi Leipheimer.

Charisma won many competitions in the sport of eventing. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest event horses ever to have competed. He stood . Breeding and early life Charisma, also known as \\"Podge\\" and \\"Stroppy,\\" was born 30 October 1972. His hand dam, Planet, was by the Thoroughbred and 1/16 Percheron stallion Kiritea. Her dam was a Thoroughbred mare named Starbourne. Planet was a very successful Grade A show jumper in New Zealand, and under rider Sheryl Douglas, became the first mare in New Zealand to jump her own height. However, an injury ended her career, and she went home and was bred to the Thoroughbred stallion, Tira Mink. Charisma's first home was on the Williams' farm in Wairarapa. Even at a young age, Charisma was laid-back and easy to train. He was soon bought by David Murdoch, who placed the yearling in a small pasture with a four-foot fence, which Charisma jumped. The colt was gelded as a four-year-old, although he managed to cover four mares before that time. Competitive career =The Beginning: 1977‚Äì1982= The young horse was slowly broken in, and later bought by Sharon Dearden in 1977. She competed him in Grade B show jumping competitions, and trained him up to intermediate level in eventing. Although the pair was long-listed for the Los Angeles Olympics, Dearden decided to sell the horse. Mrs. Fran Clark bought him and later lent him to Jennifer Stobart. Stobart brought him to Prix St Georges level in dressage \\"just for fun\\". =Under Mark Todd: 1983‚Äì1986= Mark Todd was offered Charisma to ride by Virginia Caro, as his experienced horse was sick. In May 1983, he tried the gelding out, and brought him back to his place to get the horse fit. Charisma was a bit fat at that time, and had to be bedded on newspaper strips, as he would try to eat other bedding. Keeping the weight off the horse was always quite a struggle. Charisma won his first two one-day events with Mark Todd, and then won the National One-Day Event Championship and National Three-day Event at Taupo (both of which he led after dressage and finished on his dressage score). The pair was then selected for the Los Angeles Olympics. Charisma was moved to England in February 1984. During the trip he became sick, and the illness never really left him for the rest of his career. The gelding was taken to the Badminton Horse Trials later that year, where he finished in 2nd place on his dressage score. Another satisfying finish came a few months later, at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Mark and Charisma finished well after dressage, and then put in a clear cross-country and stadium round. A rail down by Karen Stives, who was leading by a few points, allowed the pair to cinch the individual gold. After the Olympics, Charisma's owner, Fran Clark, decided to sell her horse. However, for some reason she did not seem to want Mark Todd to continue with Charisma as a mount. In 1985, she offered Charisma to the British rider Lizzie Purbrick. Knowing that Todd wanted the horse badly, Purbrick managed a deal with him to buy Charisma behind Fran Clark's back. Mark Todd's sponsor, Woolrest, transferred 50,000 pounds to Lizzie's account, to which she paid Fran Clark, and Mark Todd now was the official rider of Charisma under Woolrest's sponsorship. Needless, to say, Fran Clark was not pleased. Mark Todd continued to compete Charisma in England, where he placed second at the 1985 Badminton Horse Trials, and won every one-day event of the season in which they competed, except Dauntsey after a fall on cross-country. In 1986, the pair went to the World Championships in Australia. Unfortunately, they had a fall at the water, and two rails down in stadium, and they finished in 10th place. They redeemed themselves a few weeks later in Luhmuhlen, where they won both individually and as part of a composite team. =The end of his career: 1987‚Äì1988= However, Charisma never got his chance to win Badminton, as it was cancelled in 1987. He won the three-star in Saumur, and the pair almost won Burghley that year, but two rails down in show jumping dropped them to second. They later won the British Open Championships before shipping to Seoul. At the 1988 Olympics, Charisma put in a stellar dressage test, and jumped clear rounds in both the cross-country and stadium. He won the individual gold yet again, and beat the second-place horse, Sir Wattie, by the incredible margin of 10.20 penalties. The New Zealand team also won the bronze that year. The back-to- back Olympic win in eventing had only been accomplished once before. =Retirement= Charisma was retired after his second Olympic victory and he went home to New Zealand. He then went on a six-month tour before taking a well-earned rest. He was later shipped to Britain in 1995 to continue retirement. On 7 January 2003, Charisma was euthanized at Mark Todd's Rivermonte Farm in Cambridge, after breaking a shoulder in the field. He was 30 years old.

The firm designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom cleaning and supplies, tile and carpet cleaning, promotional products, first aid, safety, and fire protection products and services. Cintas is a publicly held company traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CTAS and is a component of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The company is one of the largest in the industry with 35,000 employees in 2017. Revenue in fiscal year 2016 was $4.905 billion and net income was $693.52 million. Fortune in the United States, named Cintas among its \\"Most Admired Companies\\" for eight consecutive years, and Report on Business Magazine named the company one of Canada's Best Employers. Cintas has been featured on episodes of the reality television series Bar Rescue and Hotel Impossible.\\"TV 'hotel fixer' endorses Cintas\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, November 30, 2012, archived from the original December 14, 2014. History Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 1940s, rags were replaced by shop towels‚Äîwhich are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags‚Äîand tablecloths. By then, the company‚Äôs name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry. His grandson, Richard \\"Dick\\" Farmer, joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick Farmer helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He became CEO of the company in 1968. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983. Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Since its inception, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning. CEO of Cintas in 2003. In July 1997, Dick Farmer's son Scott Farmer, who has been employed at the company since 1981, became president and chief operating officer. Dick Farmer retired as chief executive officer in 2003, and Scott was promoted to take his place. Dick Farmer remained chairman emeritus after his retirement. In 2015, Cintas acquired Zee Medical from McKesson Corporation for approximately $130 million. In 2016, Cintas acquired G&K; Services for $2.2 billion. In 2016, CEO Scott Farmer became chairman of the board. The company is valued at US$12.97 billion (2017).  Products  uniform rental and service of facilities comprises around 80% of the revenue. Criticism In 2003, UNITE HERE and the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters have been engaged in a campaign against Cintas, alleging unfair labor practices. Unite obtained license numbers of Cintas workers in Pennsylvania, to contact them at home and has since been ordered to pay the workers $2,500 each. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Following the death of a Tulsa, Oklahoma, worker in March 2007, both unions and several Members of Congress called for stricter health and safety standards at the company's laundries. In May 2007, Cintas hired a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, to manage their relations with Congress.FSM - The Source for Workplace Safety References External links Category:Business services companies established in 1929 Category:Business services companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Cincinnati Category:1929 establishments in Ohio Category:1980s initial public offerings Category:American companies established in 1929 ","title":"Cintas"},{"id":"2354487","text":"Leonard Mascot Blumenthal (February 27, 1901 - August 1984) was a Jewish American mathematician.

In a normal cell, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) must be maintained because proteins are the main functional units of the cell. Proteins take on a defined configuration in order to gain functionality. If these structures are altered, critical processes could be affected, leading to cell damage or death. With the importance of proteins established, the heat shock response can be employed under stress to induce heat shock proteins (HSP), also known as molecular chaperones, that help prevent or reverse protein misfolding and provide an environment for proper folding. Protein folding is already challenging due to the crowded intracellular space where aberrant interactions can arise; it becomes more difficult when environmental stressors can denature proteins and cause even more non-native folding to occur. If the work by molecular chaperones is not enough to prevent incorrect folding, the protein may be degraded by the proteasome or autophagy to remove any potentially toxic aggregates. Misfolded proteins, if left unchecked, can lead to aggregation that prevents the protein from moving into its proper conformation and eventually leads to plaque formation, which may be seen in various diseases. Heat shock proteins induced by the HSR can help prevent protein aggregation that can lead to common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, or Parkinson's Disease. The diagram depicts actions taken when a stress is introduced to the cell. Stress will induce HSF-1 and cause proteins to misfold. Molecular chaperones will aid these proteins to fold correctly or if the degree of misfolding is too severe, the protein will be eliminated through the proteasome or autophagy.  Induction of the heat shock response  With the introduction of environmental stressors, the cell must be able to maintain proteostasis. Acute or chronic subjection to these harmful conditions elicits a cytoprotective response to promote stability to the proteome. HSPs (e.g. HSP70, HSP90, HSP60, etc.) are present under normal conditions but under heat stress, they are upregulated by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). There are four different transcription factors found in vertebrates (HSF 1-4) where the main regulator of HSPs is HSF1, while œÉ32 is the heat shock transcription factor in E. coli. When not bound to DNA, HSF1 is in a monomeric state where it is inactive and negatively regulated by chaperones. When a stress occurs, these chaperones are released due to the presence of denatured proteins and various conformational changes to HSF1 cause it to undergo nuclear localization where it becomes active through trimerization. Newly trimerized HSF1 will bind to heat shock elements (HSE) located in promoter regions of different HSPs to activate transcription of HSP mRNA. The mRNA will eventually be transcribed and comprise the upregulated HSPs that can alleviate the stress at hand and restore proteostasis. HSF1 will also regulate expression of HSPs through epigenetic modifications. The HSR will eventually attenuate as HSF1 returns to its monomeric form, negatively regulated through association with HSP70 and HSP90 along with additional post- translational modifications. The HSR is not only involved with increasing transcription levels of HSPs; other facets include stress-induced mRNA stability preventing errors in mRNA and enhanced control during translation to thwart misfolding. Molecular chaperones Molecular chaperones are typically referred to as proteins that associate with and help other proteins reach a native conformation while not being present in the end state. Chaperones bind to their substrate (i.e. a misfolded protein) in an ATP-dependent manner to perform a specific function. Exposed hydrophobic residues are a major problem with regards to protein aggregation because they can interact with one another and form hydrophobic interactions. It is the job of chaperones to prevent this aggregation by binding to the residues or providing proteins a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù environment to fold properly. Heat shock proteins are also believed to play a role in the presentation of pieces of proteins (or peptides) on the cell surface to help the immune system recognize diseased cells. The major HSPs involved in the HSR include HSP70, HSP90, and HSP60. Chaperones include the HSP70s and HSP90s while HSP60s are considered to be chaperonins. The HSP70 chaperone family is the main HSP system within cells, playing a key role in translation, post-translation, prevention of aggregates and refolding of aggregated proteins. When a nascent protein is being translated, HSP70 is able to associate with the hydrophobic regions of the protein to prevent faulty interactions until translation is complete. Post-translational protein folding occurs in a cycle where the protein becomes bound/released from the chaperone allowing burying hydrophobic groups and aiding in overcoming the energy needed to fold in a timely fashion. HSP70 plays a part in de-aggregating proteins using the aforementioned mechanism; the chaperone will bind to exposed hydrophobic residues and either partially or fully disassemble the protein, allowing HSP70 to assist in the proper refolding. When proteins are beyond the point of refolding, HSP70s can help direct these potentially toxic aggregates to be degraded by the proteasome or through autophagy. HSP90s are parallel to HSP70s with respect to the refolding or proteins and use in protein clearance. One difference between the two HSPs is HSP90s ability to keep proteins in an unfolded yet stable configuration until a signal causes the protein to translocate and complete its folding. Sometimes, HSP70 is unable to effectively aid a protein in reaching its final 3-D structure; The main reason being the thermodynamic barriers for folding are too high for the chaperone to meet. Because the intracellular space is very crowded, sometimes proteins need an isolated space to prevent aberrant interactions between other proteins, which is provided by chaperonins or HSP60s . HSP60s are barrel shaped and suited to bind to the hydrophobic residues of proteins. Once a cap binds to the chaperonin, the protein is free within the barrel to undergo hydrophobic collapse and reach a stable conformation. Once the cap is removed, the protein can either be correctly folded and move on to perform its function or return to a HSP if it is still not folded accurately. These chaperones function to remove aggregation and significantly speed up protein folding.

He was the second son of Major Nicholas Brady and his wife Martha Gernon, daughter of the English-born judge and author Luke Gernon(little is known of her mother); his great-grandfather was Hugh Brady, the first Protestant Bishop of Meath. He received his education at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford; he graduated from Trinity College, Dublin. Brady was a zealous promoter of the Glorious Revolution and suffered for his beliefs in consequence. When war broke out in Ireland in 1690, Brady, by his influence, thrice prevented the burning of the town of Bandon, after James II gave orders for its destruction following the Capture of Bandon. The same year he was employed by the people of Bandon to lay their grievances before the English parliament. He soon afterward settled in London, where he obtained various preferments. At the time of his death, he held the livings of Clapham and Richmond. Brady's best-known work, written with his collaborator Nahum Tate, is New Version of the Psalms of David, a metrical version of the Psalms. It was licensed in 1696, and largely ousted the old Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter. He translated Virgil's Aeneid and wrote several smaller poems and dramas, as well as sermons. He married Letitia Synge and had four sons and four daughters.

History  Church Army was founded in England in 1882 by the Revd Wilson Carlile (afterwards prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral), who banded together in an orderly army of soldiers, officers and a few working men and women, whom he and others trained to act as Church of England evangelists among the outcasts and criminals of the Westminster slums. As a curate in the parish of St Mary Abbott, Kensington, Carlile had experimented with unorthodox forms of Christian meetings and witness, going to where coachmen, valets and others would take their evening stroll and holding open air services, persuading onlookers to say the Scripture readings, and training working people to preach. Previous experience had convinced Carlile that the moral condition of the lowest classes of the people called for new and aggressive action on the part of the Christian Church and that this work was most effectively done by lay people of the same class as those whom it was desired to reach. This was at a time when similar groups were appearing - the Revd Evan Hopkins was organising a ‚ÄòChurch Gospel Army‚Äô and other clergy had established a \\"Church Salvation Army\\" at Oxford and a \\"Church Mission Army\\" at Bristol. Carlile suggested a combined \\"Church Army\\". As the work grew, a training institution for evangelists was started in Oxford with F. S. Webster as Principal, but soon moved (1886) to London, where, in Bryanston Street near Marble Arch, the headquarters of the army was established. Marie Louise Carlile (1861-1951), Wilson Carlile's sister, was a frail woman who left a life of elegance for the tough, austere life of training women in 1888, followed by the first \\"Recue Shelter\\" for women in 1891, and continued in the mission for fifty years as leader of the Church Army Sisters. William Booth had already seen the extreme poverty and need for unorthodox evangelism work, and since 1865 had been developing a similar mission (in 1878 given the name Salvation Army), using similar \\"Christian soldier\\" metaphors, also in London slums. Church of England bishops approached Booth about the time Church Army was founded to join in their work in the slums, but he declined. Both the Church Army and the Salvation Army continued to work in the most dreadful slums; both had some difficulty with their parent churches (Church of England and Methodist) being able to cope with those coming out of the slums as a result of the mission work, and realised the need for alcohol-free refuges. During the First World War, Church Army was very active among the troops in France, and ran around 2000 social clubs across France. In 1965 a new chapel, the Church Army Chapel, Blackheath and college designed by E.T. Spashett ARIBA, in Vanbrugh Park, Blackheath, London SE3 was opened by Princess Alexandra and consecrated by Michael Ramsey. The Headquarters were in Marylebone Road, London NW. In 1978, Church Army purchased Winchester House, a former missionary school (see Eltham College) in Blackheath, south-east London, to be refurbished as its new headquarters. It was officially opened by the Queen Mother on 12 June 1980. In 1992, the Church Army vacated the Vanbrugh Park college buildings and the college was relocated to Sheffield; the buildings were taken over by Blackheath High School. In 2010 the national office of Church Army relocated from Sidcup in London to the Wilson Carlile Centre in Sheffield (formerly the training college), bringing together the national staff with the training and research staff. Training became non-residential and the building was converted to provide national offices and modern conferencing facilities together with en-suite accommodation.  Principles and practices  Church Army has over 300 commissioned evangelists working in Anglican churches, projects, and teams in the United Kingdom and Ireland. There are similarities to the Salvation Army, and the two sometimes work together (such as in the Fresh expressions initiative), but Church Army is not a separate church denomination. The current president of Church Army is Rowan Williams, previous Archbishop of Canterbury and before him Desmond Tutu, emeritus Archbishop of Cape Town and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was the president. Every September, Church Army celebrates Church Army Sunday; this is the Sunday nearest 26 September (the anniversary of Carlile's death in 1942), the day on which Carlile and the Church Army are celebrated in the revised Anglican Lectionary. On this day, the Church Army encourages churches to engage with the local community through various activities ‚Äì chocolate parties, car boot sales, and community fun days. Des Scott was appointed Interim CEO in June 2019 after Mark Russell's resignation, and is now Church Army's CEO, leading the organisation in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Des has been part of Church Army for over 30 years in various roles including as a London youth worker, overseeing Church Army's Operational Team, and held the post of Deputy CEO from 2012 until being appointed as Interim CEO.  Church Army International  Church Army International, established in 2006, is an association of eight independent Church Army societies around the world (Africa, Australia, Barbados, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, United Kingdom & Ireland, and the United States) working in over 15 countries. The purpose is to facilitate communication, co- operation, fellowship and shared vision between Church Army societies and to promote the growth of the Church Army's ministry worldwide. The leader of each society is a member of Church Army International Leaders' Forum chaired by the International Secretary. The forum has four telephone conferences each year and the leaders together with those responsible for training and board representatives meet together for a residential conference approximately every three years. In 2009 Church Army in Canada was renamed Threshold Ministries.  Training  Each Church Army Society is responsible for the training of its staff. In some situations, students are paired with evangelists currently serving in the field; others attend residential schooling. Between 1965 and 1991 the Wilson Carlile Training College was at 27 Vanburgh Park, Blackheath, where the premises included the Church Army Chapel.

It is sometimes kept in captivity. The scientific name of the red-eyed treefrog, A. callidryas, comes from Greek words kalos (beautiful) and dryas (a tree or wood nymph). Description A specimen in Costa Rica. The species has red eyes with vertically narrowed pupils. It has a vibrant green body with yellow and blue with vertically striped sides. Its webbed feet and toes are orange or red. The skin on the red-eyed treefrog's belly is soft and fragile, whereas the back is thicker and rougher. Red-eyed tree frogs have sticky pads on their toes to cling onto leaves. Distribution and habitat Red-eyed treefrogs inhabit areas near rivers and ponds in rainforests and humid lowlands on the Atlantic slopes from southern Veracruz and northern Oaxaca in Mexico, to central Panama and northern Colombia. They also live on the Pacific slope in southwestern Nicaragua and southwestern Costa Rica to eastern Panama. The optimum temperature for red-eyed treefrogs is in the daytime, and at night. Behavior Phyllomedusine treefrogs are arboreal, meaning they spend a majority of their lives in trees; they are excellent jumpers. Red-eyed treefrogs are not poisonous and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they remain motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their bellies, and shut their red eyes. Thus, they appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the foliage. The large red eyes serve as a defensive adaptation through deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed treefrog detects an approaching predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee. Diet Red-eyed treefrogs are insectivores, eating crickets, moths, grasshoppers, flies, and other insects. Sometimes, they eat smaller frogs. Tadpoles mostly eat fruit flies and pinhead crickets.Rainforest Alliance web site \\"Tree frog\\" Retrieved July 31, 2018, Updated Sep 17, 2020 Reproduction Red-eyed treefrogs in axillary amplexus Specimen in camouflage mode It has been proven that even though random mating has been documented, through different studies that were done a males body size has been an indicator of male quality while looking for a mate. The larger the frog appears signifies older age which can reflect a better partner. During the mating season, the male frogs shake the branches where they are sitting to improve their chances of finding a mate by keeping rivals at bay. This is the first evidence that tree-dwelling vertebrates use vibration to communicate. When rainfall is at its highest, a male red-eyed treefrog calls \\"chack\\" to get the attention of the female. Females use the call as well as color of the male frog in order to find a possible mate. Both call and color of the male frog show territorial display and anti-predatory behavior. During amplexus, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the oviposition process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of roughly 40 eggs. Since oviposition generally occurs on both sides of a leaf, red-eyed treefrogs may fold the leaf to hide the eggs from predators. They also produce sticky jelly to glue the eggs together; this may protect the eggs from splitting and dehydration. The eggs develop into tadpoles, which hatch after six to seven days and fall into the water below. Red-eyed treefrog eggs hatch early (exhibiting phenotypic plasticity) when a change in the environment signals a danger to their survival.Fields, Helen. (2013 January). The frog that roared. Smithsonian, 54‚Äì61. Dragonflies, fish, and water beetles prey on the tadpoles. The tadpoles remain in the water from three weeks to several months, until they metamorphose into frogs. The time of metamorphosis depends on duration of larval stage, which varies depending on environment. After metamorphosis, the color of tadpoles' torsos changes from green to brown, and their eyes, which are initially yellow, turn into deep red without much side patterning. These changes mark maturity. The lifespan of red-eyed treefrogs is about five years. Young frogs that survive the first few weeks after metamorphosis move into the undergrowth and security of plants near their natal pools, often into the hollows of tubular plants such as bromeliads. Young frogs prey on very small flies and other insects during the first months of their lives. The young mature after two years and begin mating at the age of three to four years. These treefrogs are known to live up to five years (data from captive-breeding programs), depending on the health and conditions of their habitat (when aided by abundant plant growth, plenty of fresh water, and an abundance of small and larger insects on which to prey). They sometimes breed successfully in captivity if kept in high-humidity vivaria (e.g., by using misting equipment), tropical plants such as Bromelia and other epiphyte plants, together with well-aerated water pools. Their captive habitat should have a light cycle with 11‚Äì12 hours of daylight and an average day temperature of 26‚Äì28 ¬∞C (and night- time averages of 22‚Äì25 ¬∞C). Simulating a rainy season once a year in November to December encourages reproduction. =Phenotypic plasticity= Red-eyed treefrogs' embryos exhibit phenotypic plasticity, hatching early in response to disturbance to protect themselves. Though embryos are bred synchronously, they normally hatch after 6 to 10 days from oviposition without disturbance. However, a simultaneously early hatching in entire clutches is triggered when embryos are exposed to their predators or threatening environmental changes such as rainstorm and flood. Predators are the major cause of this response. Since these frogs usually lay eggs on both the upper and the undersides of leaves above ponds, clutches need to protect themselves against arboreal, aerial and aquatic predators, such as snakes, dragonflies, fish, monkeys, and pathogenic fungi. When predators are close enough to produce detectable vibration, the embryos assess disturbance. After a few seconds, embryos vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape. Since eggs are usually laid above ponds, the response improves survival because tadpoles often fall into water on hatching. When tadpoles fall onto dry ground, they can survive up to 20 hours without water. However, vibration and disturbance caused by unthreatening environmental changes or other species do not induce early hatching. Conservation The species is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN due to its wide distribution and presumed large populations; it is also present in a large number of protected areas throughout its range. Pressures on the red-eyed treefrog include habitat loss through deforestation, and some collection for the pet trade.

Originally based in New Brighton, Minnesota, and founded by Gregory E. Herrick, the company incorporated in Minnesota in 1981.Charles Babbage Institute: The Computing Industry in Minnesota > A-B Prior to manufacturing PCs, the company was called NPC Electronics. NPC was a contract assembly business best known for developing a transmitter device called Radio Realty. Marketed primarily to real estate brokers, this product enabled prospective home buyers to tune in and listen to prerecorded information about a property listing while parked in front of the dwelling. Radio Realty was divested in the early 1980s as NPC started developing, manufacturing, and selling PCs under the ZEOS name. The company went public in mid-1985 by self-underwriting, and officially changed its name from NPC Electronics to ZEOS International. History The company's first PC related product was known as \\"PC Speeder\\", a device designed to increase the clock speed (and thereby the performance) of the 8086 processor. The company then began work engineering a motherboard to retrofit the soon-to-be-introduced Intel 386 processor on their existing 286 platform. The company sold its first PC in November 1987 with its first ad in Computer Shopper. Rapid sales and growth led ZEOS to become Fortune's fastest growing public company in America in 1991. ZEOS marketed its products primarily through mail order, but also partnered with and distributed PCs to Sam's Club stores. ZEOS also had two retail outlet stores, located in Arden Hills and Golden Valley, Minnesota, where refurbished and customer-returned hardware was resold, often at substantial discounts. Following a tradition set earlier by CP/M manufacturers like Kaypro and Morrow Designs, ZEOS bundled Lotus 1-2-3 and Ami Pro with its systems while many competitors still included only operating system software, requiring customers to purchase applications separately and elsewhere. This move eventually forced ZEOS' rivals such as Dell and Gateway 2000 to also bundle software with their systems. During the peak of its desktop business, ZEOS sold 386- and 486-based systems under the ZEOS and Discovery brand names, using various model names including Ambra and Millennium. In the mid-1990s, it sold Pentium-based desktops, branded Pantera, and laptops, branded Freestyle, Meridian, and ColorNote. ZEOS also was successful in the laptop category, introducing three 486SX based laptops before rival Dell came out with their first. The company also marketed subnotebooks branded Contenda (both 386SL-, 486SL-based) and ZEOS Pocket PC (8086-compatible palmtop, using the NEC V30 processor). The ZEOS 386SX was once featured on the cover of PC Magazine, rated as Editor's Choice in its January 30, 1990, issue. Late generation ZEOS motherboards models were code- named with a zoological theme. Motherboards based on early 486 designs went by classes of birds such as Duck, Goose, Gosling, and Martin. Later 486 and Pentium motherboards used families of serpents (i.e. snakes), such as Rattler, Python, Cobra, Coral, and Boa. Industry firsts Among other notable firsts, ZEOS was the first computer company to offer 24/7 toll-free technical support. The company was also first to capitalize on e-commerce. Subscribers of the Prodigy online service could browse and order ZEOS PCs long before the World Wide Web had any significant presence. In later years, the company was first to market preconfigured, ready-to-ship PCs under a campaign called \\"Computers Now\\", promising nationwide delivery in under 24 hours. This initiative was successfully achieved through direct marketing. Merger with Micron Technologies In 1996, ZEOS acquired Micron Computer, Inc., and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services, Inc., two business units of Boise-based Micron Technologies. The reverse takeover resulted in Micron Technologies taking a controlling interest in ZEOS. The ZEOS brand was quickly phased out, and the combined company known as Micron Electronics Inc. began trading under the symbol MUEI. The company was sold twice after the original ZEOS/Micron transaction, with the final iteration, MPC Corporation, ceasing business operations December 31, 2008. Zeos Pocket PC (PPC) Manufactured around 1991‚Äì1992 and selling for $595, the Zeos Pocket PC was a palmtop which ran MS- DOS 5.0 and was broadly similar in form and function to the Poqet PC. The device was also available as Tidalwave PS-1000, Vobis Highscreen Handy Organizer, and Peacock Palmtop PC in other countries. It was bundled with Microsoft Works and RacePen. Its dimensions were 4.5\\" √ó 9.7\\" √ó 1.0\\" and it weighed approximately . The 640x200 monochrome LCD screen was about 2.75\\" √ó 7\\" and was not backlit. The keyboard was 9\\" wide (compared to 11\\" for a standard keyboard), making typing slightly tedious for many people. The unit featured two PCMCIA card slots, as well as a serial and a parallel port located on the rear which used proprietary mini-connectors and custom cables, which were included with the unit. The unit powered on instantly using two standard AA batteries and one lithium backup battery. It was manufactured in Taiwan and sold by mail-order.

Early life Born in Detroit, Michigan, he dropped out of school in ninth grade, having to work from the time he was 13 to support his family. He made his living as a salesman. Career In the 1950s, Lederer was president of the Autopoint Company in Chicago, Illinois and in 1960, he joined Morris Mirkin, who founded Budget Rent a Car company in 1958. The pair incorporated as Budget Rent a Car Corporation in 1960. Budget Rent a Car is now a unit of Avis Budget Group. Budget Rent a Car became popular in its early days by renting cars at lower prices than its competitors, and it gained a following among a growing business and leisure travel market by renting cars from offices outside of airports. Additionally, Lederer is credited as one of the first to apply franchising to the rental car industry. Personal life In 1938, Lederer married Esther \\"Eppie\\" Pauline Friedman in a Jewish ceremony in Sioux City, Iowa. They had one daughter, Margo Howard (ex-wife of actor Ken Howard), before divorcing in 1975.\\" According to his New York Times obituary of January 23, 1999, Lederer was selling hats at T. S.

Jules and Esther fell in love and were married in a double ceremony. The two sisters would eventually become the writers of the widely syndicated advice columns, Ask Ann Landers and Dear Abby, respectively. Lederer's daughter Margo also became a newspaper columnist, writing for the Chicago Daily News. Married for 36 years, when the Lederers were divorced, Ann Landers described it in her next column as \\"one of the best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.\\" Lederer later moved to London, where he remarried and had a daughter, Anthea Lederer, with his second wife, Elizabeth. Death Lederer died of a heart attack at his home in London, aged 81. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth; his daughters, Margo Lederer Howard and Anthea Lederer; a brother, Sol; a sister, Madelyn Ferris; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

Note that the edge references look like wings. In computer graphics, the winged edge data structure is a way to represent polygon meshes in computer memory. It is a type of boundary representation and describes both the geometry and topology of a model. Three types of records are used: vertex records, edge records, and face records. Given a reference to an edge record, one can answer several types of adjacency queries (queries about neighboring edges, vertices and faces) in constant time. This kind of adjacency information is useful for algorithms such as Subdivision surface.  Features  The winged edge data structure explicitly describes the geometry and topology of faces, edges, and vertices when three or more surfaces come together and meet at a common edge. The ordering is such that the surfaces are ordered counter-clockwise with respect to the innate orientation of the intersection edge. Moreover the representation allows numerically unstable situations like that depicted below. Image:point on edge.png The winged edge data structure allows for quick traversal between faces, edges, and vertices due to the explicitly linked structure of the network. It serves adjacency queries in constant time with little storage overhead. This rich form of specifying an unstructured grid is in contrast to simpler specifications of polygon meshes such as a node and element list, or the implied connectivity of a regular grid. An alternative to the winged edge data structure is the Half-edge data structure.  Structure and pseudocode  The face and vertex records are relatively simple, while the edge record is more complex. For each vertex, its record stores only the vertex' position (e.g. coordinates) and a reference to one incident edge (the other edges can be found by following further references in the edge). Similarly each face record only stores a reference to one of the edges surrounding the face. Finally, the structure of the edge record is as follows. An edge is assumed to be directed. The edge record contains two references to the vertices that make up the endpoints of the edge, two references to the faces on either side of the edge, and four references to the previous and next edges surrounding the left and right face. In short, the edge record has references to all its adjacent records, both when traversing around an adjacent vertex or around an adjacent face. class Edge { Vertex *vert_origin, *vert_destination; Face *face_left, *face_right; Edge *edge_left_cw, *edge_left_ccw, *edge_right_cw, *edge_right_ccw; } class Vertex { float x, y, z; Edge *edge; } class Face { Edge *edge; }  See also  * Quad-edge data structure * Combinatorial maps * Doubly connected edge list * Doubly linked face list * Half-edge data structure  External links  * Bruce G.

There were 46 individuals who were Buddhist, 54 individuals who were Hindu and 23 individuals who belonged to another church. 2,311 (or about 22.42% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 1,177 individuals (or about 11.42% of the population) did not answer the question. Education In Versoix about 2,774 or (26.9%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 2,132 or (20.7%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 2,132 who completed tertiary schooling, 31.4% were Swiss men, 26.9% were Swiss women, 22.2% were non-Swiss men and 19.5% were non-Swiss women. During the 2009-2010 school year there were a total of 3,061 students in the Versoix school system. The education system in the Canton of Geneva allows young children to attend two years of non-obligatory Kindergarten. During that school year, there were 200 children who were in a pre-kindergarten class. The canton's school system provides two years of non- mandatory kindergarten and requires students to attend six years of primary school, with some of the children attending smaller, specialized classes. In Versoix there were 413 students in kindergarten or primary school and 65 students were in the special, smaller classes. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced schools. There were 413 lower secondary students who attended school in Versoix. There were 605 upper secondary students from the municipality along with 90 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 596 students attended a private school.Canton of Geneva Statistical Office El√®ves r√©sidant dans le canton de Gen√®ve, selon le niveau d'enseignement, par commune de domicile accessed 18 April 2011 , there were 1,082 students in Versoix who came from another municipality, while 688 residents attended schools outside the municipality.

Flyswatter A typical flyswatter A flyswatter (or fly-swat, fly swatter) usually consists of a small rectangular or round sheet of some across of lightweight, flexible, vented material (usually thin metallic, rubber, or plastic mesh), attached to a lightweight wire or plastic handle or wood or metal handle about long. The venting or perforations minimize the disruption of air currents, which can be detected by the fly and allow it to escape, and also reduce air resistance, making it easier to hit a fast-moving target such as a fly. A flyswatter is ideally lightweight and stiff, allowing quick acceleration to overcome the fast reaction time of the fly, while also minimizing damage caused by hitting other objects. The flyswatter usually works by mechanically crushing the fly against a hard surface, after the user has waited for the fly to land somewhere. However, some skilled users can injure or stun an airborne insect in mid-flight by whipping the swatter through the air at an extreme speed. =History= The abeyance of insects by use of short horsetail staffs and fans is ancient. The earliest flyswatters were in fact nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick. An early patent on a commercial flyswatter was issued in 1900 to Robert R. Montgomery who called it a fly-killer. Montgomery sold his patent to John L. Bennett, a wealthy inventor and an industrialist who made further improvements on the design. However, the origin of the name \\"flyswatter\\" does not come from its inventors. In the summer of 1905, Kansas was plagued by an overabundance of flies, which as well as causing annoyance, aided in the spread of communicable disease. Dr. Samuel Crumbine, a member of the Kansas board of health, wanted to raise public awareness of the threat of flies. He was inspired by a chant at a local Topeka softball game: \\"swat the ball\\". In a health bulletin published soon afterwards, he exhorted Kansans to \\"swat the fly\\". In response, a schoolteacher named Frank H. Rose created the \\"fly bat\\", a device consisting of a yardstick attached to a piece of screen. Crumbine had named the device now commonly known as the flyswatter. Fly gun A fly gun The fly gun (or flygun), a derivative of the flyswatter, uses a spring-loaded plastic projectile to mechanically \\"swat\\" flies. Mounted on the projectile is a perforated circular disk, which, according to advertising copy, \\"won't splat the fly\\". Several similar products are sold, mostly as toys or novelty items, although their supporters maintain that they work as well as traditional fly swatters. Another gun-like design has a pair of mesh sheets spring loaded to \\"clap\\" together when a trigger is pulled, squashing the fly between them. In contrast to the traditional flyswatter, such a design can only be used on an insect in mid-air. Another projectile fly killer is the Bug-a-Salt, a miniaturized shotgun that shoots a spray of dry table salt using a spring- compressed air blast similar to a BB rifle. It has an accurate range of about , and the killed bugs remain whole for easy cleanup. The pneumatic salt-shot approach is claimed to be effective, because the high speed, small-sized salt grains are apparently undetected by the targeted fly until it is too late to dodge them. Fly bottle Three fly bottles from Central Europe, beginning of the 20th century A fly bottle or glass flytrap is a passive trap for flying insects. In the Far East, it is a large bottle of clear glass with a black metal top in which there is a hole. An odorous bait is placed in the bottom of the bottle in the form of pieces of meat. Flies enter the bottle in search of food and are then unable to escape because their phototaxis behavior leads them anywhere in the bottle except to the darker top where the entry hole is. A European fly bottle is more conical, with small feet that raise it , with a trough about an wide and deep that runs inside the bottle all around the central opening at the bottom of the container. In use, the bottle is stood on a plate and some sugar is sprinkled on the plate to attract the flies, which eventually fly up into the bottle, whose trough is filled with beer or vinegar, into which the flies fall and drown. In the past, the trough was also sometimes filled with a dangerous mixture of milk, water, and arsenic or mercury chloride. Variants of these bottles are the agricultural fly traps used to fight the Mediterranean fruit fly and the olive fly, which have been in use since the 1930s. They are smaller, without feet, and the glass is thicker for rough outdoor usage, often involving suspension in a tree or bush. Modern versions of this device are often made of plastic, and can be purchased in some hardware stores. They can also be improvised from disposable plastic drink bottles. Disposable fly traps Disposable fly traps are small ‚Äúuse and throw away‚Äù fly traps. The traps are disposable plastic bags containing some attractant, generally made of flavoring agents that are non-toxic. Water and direct sunlight are used to activate the attractant, which emits a smell to lure the flies. Insects enter the trap and drown in the water inside. Glue board A glue board is a capture device with a strong adhesive. A small card covered in sticky adhesive is situated in an enclosure so that when the flies come into contact with it, they remain stuck and die there. A reusable glue board may be renewed through the use of vegetable oil, and then removing the oil with dishwashing detergent and a water rinse. Alternatively, the card is disposed of and completely replaced periodically. Flypaper A sticky fly ribbon Flypaper (also known as fly paper, fly sticker, fly strip, fly ribbon, or fly tape) attracts flies to adhesive so that they can be trapped. The exposed adhesive strip makes it more stick-prone than an enclosed glue board. To avoid accidental entanglement with humans, the strips are often hung in relatively inaccessible spaces, such as near ceilings. One type of fly strip is packaged in a small cardboard tube with a pin on the top. It is used by pulling the pin off the top (usually covered with wax), removing the adhesive \\"fly strip\\" and using the pin to attach it to a ceiling, with the tube dangling below as a small weight. Flypaper is not reused, but is replaced when it loses effectiveness. Flypaper is often impregnated with a slightly odorous chemical to attract more flies. The attractiveness of flypaper to other insects (such as mosquitos and biting midges) is sometimes enhanced by shining a small portable electric light on the sticky surface. Bug vacuum A bug vacuum (bug vac or aspirator) is a type of small but powerful portable vacuum cleaner, usually with internal batteries. The motor starts quickly and generates strong suction, trapping the flying insect inside the device. The insect may be captured on an adhesive internal surface, or simply held inside the device until it dehydrates and dies. Some bug vacuums feature non-lethal designs which keep trapped insects inside, but do not otherwise harm them, allowing their later release. These devices are popular with amateur and professional entomologists, and with persons who wish to avoid the killing of insects. Fan-based trap This design uses a continuously-running electric fan to suck in flying insects (especially mosquitos and gnats, which are weak fliers), which are then trapped by a fine mesh grid or bag. Unable to escape the constant airflow, the insects quickly dehydrate and die. Some variant designs use carbon dioxide, ultraviolet light, or chemical scent to attract insects to the trap. Other designs rely on the natural carbon dioxide or scents emitted by people, pets, or livestock to attract pests, and simply collect flying insects as they wander close enough to be sucked in. In addition, the continuous breeze produced by a common electric fan has been found to discourage mosquitos from landing and biting, even without trapping or killing the insects. Bug zapper A bug zapper electric grid (fly zapper) kills insects by electrocution from high voltage on adjacent metallic grids. Bug zappers are generally small appliances intended for use in a fixed location, as distinguished from hand held electric flyswatters. Electric flyswatter An electric flyswatter Closeup view of three layer grid: mesh and rods oppositely charged Closeup view of single layer grid: odd and even rods oppositely chargedMaximum charge 45 ¬µC Electric flyswatter (sometimes called mosquito bat, racket zapper, or zap racket) is a battery-powered, handheld bug zapper that resembles a tennis racket, which became popular worldwide in the late 1990s. US Patent 5,519,963 was awarded to Taiwanese inventor Tsao-i Shih in 1996 for such a device. The handle contains a battery-powered high-voltage generator. The circuit is composed of an electronic oscillator, a step-up transformer and a voltage multiplier, similar to the circuit in an electroshock weapon or stun gun, but with much lower power. The grid of the flyswatter is electrically charged to a voltage of between 500 and 2,750 volts (V), activated by pressing and holding a button. When the electrically conductive body of a fly nearly bridges the gap between electrodes, a spark jumps through the fly. A capacitor attached to the electrodes discharges during the spark, and this initial discharge usually stuns or kills the fly. If the button is still pressed, the continuous current will roast and kill the fly. Many flyswatters have a three-layer grid to prevent people from touching both electrodes. The outermost grids or rods are at the same electrical potential, and are open enough to allow an insect to contact the inner charged grid. Most electric flyswatters conform to electrical safety standards for humans: * A limit on the charge stored in the capacitor: A discharge of less than 45 microcoulombs (¬µC) is considered safe, even in the unlikely scenario that the current from a flyswatter would be flowing from one arm to the other arm, partly through the heart.Electrical Safety Standard IEC 61010-1 This means that the capacitor of a 1000 V flyswatter should be less than 45 nanofarads (nF). Due to this precaution for humans, the initial shock is usually inadequate to kill flies, but will stun them for long enough that they can be disposed of. * A limit on the current after the initial discharge: The maximal continuous current of most flyswatters is less than 5 milliamperes (mA). This current is safe, even when flowing from one arm to the other arm of a human.Electrical Safety Standard IEC 479-1 An advantage over conventional flyswatters is that the electrical models do not have to mechanically crush the fly against a hard surface to kill it, avoiding the smeared mess this can create. Also, the electrical grid can be relatively open, reducing air resistance and a rush of air that often deflects smaller insects around conventional swatters. Because of this, electric swatters can also be very effective in killing airborne mosquitoes and sand flies.

History =Conception (1999‚Äì2004)= Couchsurfing was conceived by computer programmer and New Hampshire native Casey Fenton in 1999, when he was 21 years old. The idea arose after Fenton found a cheap flight from Boston to Iceland but did not have lodging. Fenton hacked into a database of the University of Iceland and randomly e-mailed 1,500 students asking for a homestay. He received between 50 and 100 offers and chose to stay at the home of an Icelandic rhythm and blues singer. On the return flight to Boston, he came up with the idea to create the website. He registered the couchsurfing.com domain name on 12 June 1999. Couchsurfing International Inc. was formed on 2 April 2003 as a New Hampshire nonprofit corporation, with plans to apply for 501(c)(3) tax exemption. The website was launched on 12 June 2004 with the cooperation of Dan Hoffer, Sebastien Le Tuan, and Leonardo Silveira. =Development of the website by volunteers (2006‚Äì2011)= From 2006 until the company raised financing in 2011, development of the website occurred mostly at events called \\"Couchsurfing Collectives\\", in which members met to voluntarily improve the website. Collectives took place in Montreal, Vienna, New Zealand, Rotterdam, Costa Rica, Samara, Alaska, Istanbul, and Thailand. However, the collectively-coded website was full of software bugs and crashes were common. Many members believed that the website needed to be redesigned from scratch. In June 2006, problems with the website database resulted in much of it being irrevocably lost. Founder Casey Fenton posted online asking for help. A Couchsurfing Collective was underway in Montreal at the time and those in attendance raised $8,000 in donations and committed to recreate the website. In 2007, Google search volume for couchsurfing.org overtook the search volume for its major competitor Hospitality Club, after the one of Hospitality Club peaked in 2006. =Change to a for-profit corporation and financing (2011)= The company applied for 501(c)(3) tax status as a nonprofit organization in November 2007 but tax exempt status was rejected by the Internal Revenue Service in early 2011. After researching alternatives, advice from lawyers, the need for additional financial resources, and competition from Airbnb, management decided that the non profit company would sell its assets to a newly founded for-profit corporation. The New Hampshire non-profit Couchsurfing International Inc. was dissolved on 4 November 2011. Its assets were sold to a private for-profit Delaware C corporation, also called Couchsurfing International, Inc., which was formed on 3 May 2011. The company was briefly certified as a B corporation, but that certification was eventually removed. In the August 24, 2011, blog post announcement Casey Fenton confused a B Corporation (certification) with a Benefit corporation, \\"As a B (Benefit) Corporation, CouchSurfing will be part of a group of innovative businesses that deliver products and services with a commitment to social and environmental responsibility, transparency, fair work conditions, and doing good for the world... CouchSurfing will never make you pay to host and surf.\\" Couchsurfing was not a Benefit Corporation, and Delaware did not permit incorporation as a Benefit corporation until 2013, yet the error received widespread publication. In August 2011, in conjunction with the reorganization to a for-profit corporation, the company raised $7.6 million in a first-round financing led by Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network. In August 2012, Couchsurfing received an additional $15 million in funding from an investor group led by General Catalyst Partners, with participation by Menlo Ventures, as well as existing investors Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network. The additional funding brought the company's total funding raised to $22.6 million. Criticism from members of the conversion to a for-profit corporation The guiding principles of the original non profit organisation promised that CouchSurfing operates as a nonprofit, a promise that was broken by Fenton and Hoffer. The conversion to a for-profit corporation was objected to by many members. Founder Casey Fenton said he received 1,500 emails in the days after announcing the conversion. =Launch and development of mobile apps= In 2012, the company launched mobile apps for iOS and Android. In June 2016, the company added a feature called \\"hangouts\\" that enables members to quickly meet with other nearby members. =Management turnover (2012‚Äì2015)= Jennifer Billock, CEO of CouchSurfing from October 2013 to October 2015 Co- founder Dan Hoffer served as CEO from 2011 to 2012, Tony Espinoza served as CEO from 2012 to 2013, and Jennifer Billock served as CEO from 2013 to 2015. Casey Fenton is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company. =Change to membership fee revenue model (2020)= In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company instituted a permanent membership fee in some countries. Members who previously paid for \\"Lifetime Verification,\\" were granted free access until May 2021. The implementation of the membership fee led to \\"widespread anger\\" and criticism. In 2012, Tony Espinoza had said in an interview: \\"Even as the site looks for additional revenue streams, the co-founders promise that hosting and surfing will always remain free.\\" See also *Altruism *Hospitality *List of hospitality exchange services *Reputation system References External links * * Category:Hospitality exchange services Category:Hospitality companies established in 2003 Category:American social networking websites Category:Cultural exchange Category:Social planning websites ","title":"CouchSurfing"},{"id":"2354565","text":"The Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library is a library of psychoactive drug- related literature created in 1970 by Michael D. Horowitz, Cynthia Palmer, William Dailey, and Robert Barker, who merged their private libraries. It was named for Fitz Hugh Ludlow, author of the first full-length work of drug literature written by an American, The Hasheesh Eater (1857). It was the largest such library in the world and was based in San Francisco, California. The Ludlow Library became part of the Ludlow Santo Domingo Library in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2003. After the death of its owner, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, Jr., his family loaned the book collection to the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the music collection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. During the 1970s the library grew rapidly and operated out of San Francisco as an international resource for psychoactive drug research, and for the study of psychoactive drug use in contemporary and historical societies. The Ludlow Library flourished during a period of perhaps the most intense media interest ever focused on the personal, social, scientific and political aspects of drug experience. The Library helped hundreds of writers, filmmakers, and news media researchers collect accurate historical information on cannabis, the opiates, coca and cocaine, and psychedelics for their publications. The library was curated by Michael R. Aldrich, holder of the first Ph.D. ever granted from an American university in the mythology and folklore of cannabis (SUNY-Buffalo, 1970), and he and his wife Michelle Aldrich joined the co-founders as members of the Board of Directors in 1974. The Library's advisory Board of Trustees included a number of eminent researchers and writers, including Chauncey Leake, Richard Evans Schultes, Albert Hofmann, Alexander Shulgin, Andrew Weil, Oscar Janiger, Ralph Metzner, Laura Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, Weston LaBarre, R.

His period in office was noted for internal PDP disputes resulting in a failure of effective government. After leaving office, he was embroiled in court cases over alleged involvement in a political murder.  Early life and Education  Chinwoke Mbadinuju was born on 14 June 1945. He obtained a BA in Political Science, and a doctorate in Government. He gained a Law degree from one of the best English Universities, He was an editor of Times International. Before entering politics he was an Associate Professor of Politics and African Studies at the State University of New York. He was Personal Assistant to Governor of the old Enugu State, Dr. Jim Chris Nwobodo, between 1979 and 1980. He served as the Personal Assistant to President Shehu Shagari between 1980 and 1983. He is married to Nnebuogo Mbadinuju, and they have five children: Ada Mbadinuju (a medical doctor), Chetachi Mbadinuju (an entrepreneur), Nwachukwu Mbadinuju (an operations manager), Uche Mbadinuju (a student) and Chima Mbadinuju (a student). Governor of Anambra State Anambra State in Nigeria After the return to democracy in 1998, Chinwoke Mbadinuju became the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Anambra State governorship in competition with professor A.B.C Nwosu, who had served four military governors as Commissioner for Health, after a dispute that had to be resolved by the PDP Electoral Appeal Panel. He was elected Governor of Anambra State in April 1999 and he was the least performed Governor since the creation of the state in 1991. Mbadinuju had been sponsored by Emeka Offor, an Anambra kingmaker. After a falling out between Mbadinuju and his \\"godfather\\", Offor, the power struggle between the two men crippled the machinery of government in the state. By September 2002, unpaid teachers had been on strike for a year and civil servants and court workers had been on strike for months. The president of the Onitsha branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Barnabas Igwe, said state leaders had pocketed the money meant to pay the striking workers. On 1 September 2002, Igwe and his pregnant wife Amaka were brutally and publicly assassinated by Nigerian militia men. While in office, Chinwoke Mbaninuju passed a law that created the Anambra Vigilante Services, which legally enshrined the Bakassi Boys, a popular if feared vigilante group credited with reducing crime in the state. Mbadinuju said that crime in the state had reached such an appalling level that something had to be done. In a November 2009 interview, Mbadinuju defended his decision on the basis of the results it achieved in reducing crime. He later fell out with Chris Uba, another power broker or godfather in the state. Mbadinuju claimed that he was excluded from the governorship contest in 2003 despite winning the PDP primaries because Uba and President Olusegun Obasanjo opposed his candidacy. In his place, Dr. Chris Ngige ran for the PDP, but he was beaten by the candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Eventually, after the election was nullified and re-run, Chris Ngige gained the post. Later career In December 2005, the police arraigned Chinwoke Mbadinuju on charges that he had conspired to murder Barnabas Igwe of the Nigerian Bar Association and his wife, Amaka, in September 2002. Mbadinuju was accused of masterminding the killing although he was in Houston, Texas at the time of the assassination. Igwe had been a vocal critic of Mbadinuju, calling for his resignation due to the failure to pay government workers for several months. In January 2006 Mbadinuju was retained in prison custody over the suit. In June 2008, the case was reopened when an Abuja High Court said Chinwoke Mbadinuju was again wanted over alleged forgery and conspiracy in the murder of Barnabas Igwe, and his wife. The police claimed the accused had forged a police document exonerating Mbadinuju of the Igwes' killing.

James Lacaita Life He was the only son of Diego Lacaita of Manduria in the Terra d'Otranto, and of Agata Conti of Agnone in the Molise. He was born at Manduria, in the province of Lecce, Kingdom of Naples, on 4 October 1813. He took a law degree at the university of Naples, was admitted an advocate in 1836, and practised his profession. An acquaintance with Enos Throop, United States charg√© d'affaires at Naples, begun in December 1838, helped him in the study of English, and this knowledge gained him the post of legal adviser to the British legation at Naples, and the friendship of the minister, Sir William Temple, at whose table he met many English travellers of distinction. Lacaita's political opinions were liberal but moderate, and he never belonged to any secret society. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the representation of the city of Naples in 1848, and on 7 April was appointed secretary to the Neapolitan legation in London, but did not start for his post, which he resigned after the fall of the liberal Troya ministry in May. In November 1850, he met Gladstone, who was in Naples in order to collect information about Bourbon misrule. This led to the arrest of Lacaita on 3 January 1851, and he remained in custody for nine days. In a letter from Gladstone to Panizzi, in September, he is referred to as 'a most excellent man, hunted by the government'. The publication of Gladstone's letters to Lord Aberdeen, for which Lacaita supplied many striking facts, aroused the hostility of the court and clerical partisans in Italy, and Lacaita found it advisable to leave Naples for London, where he arrived on 8 January 1852. He was at Edinburgh on 14 February, in May he was an unsuccessful candidate for the office of librarian of the London Library, and on 15 June he married Maria Clavering (died 1853), daughter of Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, seventh baronet. His means were small, but he made many powerful friends in the best political and literary circles in London and Edinburgh. From November 1853 until April 1856 he was professor of Italian at Queen's College, London, was naturalised in July 1855, and published 'Selections from the best Italian Writers'. In the winter of 1856-7 he accompanied Lord Minto to Florence and Turin. From 1857 to 1863, he acted as private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, and towards the close of 1858 went with Gladstone to the Ionian Islands as secretary to the mission, being made K.C.M.G. for his services in March 1859. Lacaita was entrusted by Cavour with a delicate diplomatic negotiation in 1860 connected with schemes to prevent Garibaldi from crossing from Sicily to Calabria, and subsequently the Neapolitan government offered him the post of minister in London with the title of marquis, both of which he declined. In December 1860, after the expulsion of the Bourbons, he revisited Naples, caused his name to be reinstated on the municipal registry, and in July 1861, while back in England, was returned as deputy to the first Italian legislature. He generally supported the new Italian government. After the dissolution of 1865 he did not seek re-election, and was made a senator in 1876. Though speaking but seldom in the chamber, he exercised a considerable influence upon public affairs between 1861 and 1876 through his intimacy with Ricasoli, La Marmora, Minghetti, Visconti-Venosta, and other leading men. Florence became his headquarters in Italy after the removal of the government thence from Turin, and so it remained even after the transfer of the capital to Rome. He spent a portion of each year in England, and during the last fifteen years of his life wintered at Leucaspide, near Taranto, where he had made large purchases of monastic lands in 1868. In 1884, the English writer Janet Ross and her husband travelled to Apulia where they stayed with Sir James Lacaita at his estate (Villa Leuc√†spide). While there, Janet travelled extensively throughout the region. The trip inspired her book Land of Manfred prince of Tarentum... (London 1899), which she dedicated to Lacaita. He was a director of the Italian company for the Southern Railways from its formation, and took a share in the management of several Anglo-Italian public companies. Besides his English title, he was a knight of the Brazilian order of the Rose, and knight commander of S. Maurizio e Lazzaro and of the Corona d'Italia. He died at Posilipo, near Naples, on 4 January 1895. Works An authority on Dante, he gave lectures on Italian literature and history while in England; he wrote articles on Italian subjects, and edited Benvenuto da Imola's Latin lectures on Dante delivered in 1375. He cooperated with George Warren, 5th Baron Vernon in his edition of Dante's Inferno (London, 1858-1865), and compiled a catalogue in four volumes of the Duke of Devonshire's library at Chatsworth (London, 1879).C.

It stars Nicole Kidman as iconic American photographer Diane Arbus, who was known for her strange, disturbing images, and also features Robert Downey Jr. and Ty Burrell. As the title implies, the film is largely fictional. Plot The movie opens with Diane Arbus arriving to shoot pictures at a nudist colony. The story then flashes back to three months earlier in New York City, 1958. Diane Arbus plays assistant to her photographer husband Allan. Diane is from a wealthy family; her father is a furrier. Allan's family has run a photo studio for decades. Diane is clearly uncomfortable with the tepid life of a city wife and mother (to their two girls). One night during a party, she is gazing out the window and catches the eye of the mysterious neighbor who has just moved in upstairs. His face is completely covered except for the eyes and mouth. That evening after the party, Diane stands on their patio, opens her dress and exposes her bra. She admits this to her husband. A few days later, her daughter informs her of a problem with the plumbing. Opening up a pipe, Diane discovers clumps of hair blocking it. As she removes the hair, a key tumbles down. She takes the hair and key out to the trash, and then buzzes her upstairs neighbor to ask if he's been grooming a dog. He says no, and then suggests she look in the basement, which she does. She sees an ornate chair and a sideshow poster of a \\"wild man,\\" which an armless woman then dusts off. Diane assumes she's the wife of the neighbor. When she can't sleep, Diane grabs the camera (that her husband had gifted her years before, and she'd as of yet never used), and goes upstairs to introduce herself to her neighbor, and ask if she could shoot his portrait. He asks her if she got the key, and then tells her to return the next night. She leaves, and then goes to grab the key out of the trash. Thus begins her relationship with Lionel Sweeney, a man with hypertrichosis who is in demand as a wigmaker. Lionel sees in Diane a kindred spirit, and he takes her places where she meets transvestites, dwarves and others living on the fringes of society. Diane tells Allan she'd like to take time off from the business to take her own photographs, starting with the neighbors. He's supportive of her. As Diane spends more with Lionel, she grows more attracted to him and this new, strange and exciting world. She's taking photographs, but hides the undeveloped film in a cookie jar. The key was to Lionel's apartment, so Diane can let herself in at any time. Lionel asks to be introduced to Diane's husband. Soon Diane has brought Lionel even into her family life. Her children help him with his wig making business, and he reads bedtime stories to them. She introduces him to her mother and father. At her and Allan's anniversary party, Diane finds Lionel breathing in some substance. He admits that his lungs are disintegrating, and within a few months he'll be \\"drowning.\\" She cries at this news. They almost kiss, but are interrupted by Allan, who sees their intimate moment, and then leaves. Later at home, he asks Diane if she'd kissed him, but then realizes it doesn't matter if they have or if they haven't, that he knows her feelings towards Lionel. He begs her not to tear their family apart. Diane agrees to end the affair, and dresses and goes upstairs to do so. When she lets herself in to Lionel's, she finds him naked with shaving cream and razor in hand. He asks her to completely shave him. When he's naked, they make love. When she asks why he wanted to be shaved (after previously professing it wasn't worth the effort), he reveals he intends to \\"swim out,\\" to commit suicide in the ocean, and wants her to be with him when he does it. She's devastated but agrees. They profess their love for each other. In the meantime, her daughter, having found her film stash, gives it to Allan to develop. Allan sees his wife's talent for the first time. At the beach, Lionel presents Diane with a gift: a fur jacket, made from his own hair. She walks with Lionel to the edge of the water, and watches as he gleefully swims out. She returns to her home, and as she puts the key in the door, realizes she cannot go in, back to her old life. Allan, standing on the other side of the door, does nothing. Diane returns to Lionel's apartment, rolls in his bed, and breathes the air he'd blown into a life raft to inflate it. Suddenly, she's surrounded by all of Lionel's friends, and they have a party to honor him. One of his friends gives her a photo album Lionel wanted her to have. It has fifty empty pages, all with photo plate tags in Lionel's handwriting. He wants her to fill them with her photographs. Diane, touched by her experience with Lionel, now knows what direction to take with her life and career. The final scene shows her at a nudist camp, where she meets a woman who assumes she wants to take her picture. Arbus admits this, but first asks the woman to tell her a secret. The woman asks Diane to tell her a secret first, and Diane agrees.

Retrieved on September 26, 2010.) was the second largest movie and game rental company in the United States and Canada, behind Blockbuster Video. The company rented and sold Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, VHS tapes, and video games. Founded in Dothan, Alabama, the company was headquartered in Dothan, and later in Wilsonville, Oregon. On April 30, 2010, Movie Gallery announced it was closing and liquidating all of its stores per a filing of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At its peak the firm had about 4,700 stores in North America, operating mainly under the Movie Gallery, Hollywood Video, and GameCrazy brands. The last of the company's stores were closed in August 2010. In 2011, three Movie Gallery locations in Northwest Arkansas reopened by an independent business owner who acquired the trademark rights in Arkansas. In 2013, an independent businessman in Jackson, Mississippi acquired the trademark rights in Mississippi to Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video and announced intentions to reopen select previously profitable stores. Most regular Movie Galleries were located in rural areas, while Hollywood Video locations, which competed directly with Blockbuster, were located in urban areas. History Movie Gallery was formed in 1985 by Joe Malugen and Harrison Parrish in Dothan, Alabama. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, M.G.A., the company's founders began operating video specialty stores in southern Alabama and the Florida panhandle, and franchising the Movie Gallery store concept. By June 1987 the company owned five stores and had a franchise operation of 45 stores. In 1988, the company began to consolidate the franchisees into company owned stores. By 1992, the company had a total of 37 stores and annual revenues of $6 million. In August 1994, the company completed an initial public offering of its stock. With the proceeds from this offering, the company began to quickly complete acquisitions of various video chains, primarily in the southeast. In early 1995, the company raised additional public funds and continued the acquisition and development of stores. By the middle of 1996, only 22 months after beginning its aggressive expansion strategy, Movie Gallery had grown to over 850 stores through over 100 separate acquisitions. In 1999, Movie Gallery announced plans to build 100 new stores. The company completed an 88-store acquisition of Blowout Entertainment in May and ended the year with more than 950 locations in 31 states. In 2000, Movie Gallery again set its goal at opening 100 new stores and relocating 25. This goal was surpassed. The company moved forward with its largest single-chain acquisition to date, expanding its base of stores by 30%, in late December 2001. The addition of Video Update stores to the Movie Gallery family launched the company's international presence with 100 retail locations in Canada. Movie Gallery achieved the 1,678 store mark in 2002. In 2005, the company completed the largest acquisition to date with the Hollywood Entertainment merger. This combination of companies increased the store total to 4,700 with revenues in excess of $2.5 billion. In addition, Movie Gallery opened 61 new stores in Western Canada with the acquisition of VHQ Entertainment. =Downfall= The company began having financial difficulties and announced the closure of 520 stores in September 2007. At the time Movie Gallery had about 4,500 locations. The next month, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Because of these troubles, the stock price dropped below $1 per share and was removed from listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2007. An additional 400 stores were scheduled to close during the bankruptcy reorganization. Movie Gallery emerged from Chapter 11 in May 2008 and appointed C. J. Gabriel, Jr. as the new chief executive officer. Founder and former CEO Joe Malugen continued to serve on the Movie Gallery Board of Directors until leaving on July 30, 2008. The company relocated its headquarters to Wilsonville, Oregon, (home of the Hollywood Video subsidiary) in late 2008. In January 2009, they closed their Wilsonville distribution center. In early 2009, Movie Gallery operated about 2,700 locations and 1,300 Hollywood Video locations in the United States.Company ProfileReuters.com Canadian operations included over 200 \\"Movie Gallery\\" branded stores, as well as approximately 60 under the VHQ brand in western Canada.

January 22, 2009. Modified on January 23, 2009. Retrieved on September 26, 2010. The Chapter 11 reorganization plan failed to solve all of the company's problems; Movie Gallery's stock fell from $1.25 at close in October 2009 to $0.05 a share at close on December 3, 2009, and many locations fell behind on rent. On February 1, 2010, stores received a report stating that about 800 stores were to be shut down. The company hired the law firm of Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal to prepare for a second filing of bankruptcy, and on February 3, 2010, they again filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During a company-wide conference call on April 30, 2010, it was announced that all U.S. Hollywood Video, Movie Gallery, and Game Crazy stores would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2010. On June 8, 2010, the company's Canadian stores also entered liquidation. The last US Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video locations closed on July 31, 2010, and the liquidation sale was completed. The remaining Canadian stores closed during the week of August 8. The contents of the company's headquarters were auctioned off in August 2010.  Subsidiaries  =MovieBeam= MovieBeam was a set-top service offered in larger cities in which customers could download movies to a set-top box. Most movies expired within 24 hours of downloading. The company was founded by Disney and other investors as an alternative to online movie downloads. A special set-top box had to be purchased by consumers for the service at a retail price of $149.95. Most major movie studios provided new release content to the service. However, MovieBeam failed to gain any serious traction in the marketplace. MovieBeam was shut down on December 15, 2007.Movie Gallery Inc ‚Äì Home As of June 2008 the remnants of MovieBeam, including its trademarks and other intellectual properties, were sold to an outside investors group for approximately $2 million as part of the company's restructuring. All in-store kiosks for the service were then removed as well. =Hollywood Video= A typical Hollywood Video store Hollywood Video, a subsidiary of Movie Gallery, Inc., operated from Wilsonville, Oregon, as a DVD and video game rental shop chain in the United States. It was started in 1988 by former CEO Mark Wattles and his wife. The chain was the largest direct competitor of Blockbuster Video until it was purchased by Movie Gallery in 2005. Hollywood Video declared bankruptcy in February 2010 and announced that it would shut down three months later. Purchase of Hollywood Video Hollywood Video was the target of a hostile takeover attempt, initially announced at the end of December 2004 by competitor Blockbuster Video. In February 2005, Blockbuster announced an exchange offer of $14.50 per share ($11.50 cash and $3.00 in Blockbuster shares). In order to create a stronger position against the hostile takeover, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout on Monday, January 10, 2005, by its smaller competitor Movie Gallery. Movie Gallery paid $860 million, $13.25 per share, and the assumption of $380 million in debt. Stocks closed at $13.85 on January 10 after the news. Blockbuster then dropped its purchase plans, citing anti-trust concerns. Movie Gallery completed its purchase of Hollywood Video on April 27, 2005.

Balaji Vishwanath assisted a young Maratha Emperor Shahu to consolidate his grip on a kingdom that had been racked by civil war and persistently intruded on by the Mughals under Aurangzeb. He was called the Second Founder of the Maratha State. Later, his son Bajirao I became the Peshwa. Early life and career  Balaji Vishwanath Bhat was born into an Indian Konkanastha Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family. The family hailed from the coastal Konkan region of present-day Maharashtra and were the hereditary Deshmukh for Shrivardhan under the Siddi of Janjira. He went out in search of employment to the upper regions of western ghats and worked as a mercenary trooper under various Maratha generals. According to Kincaid & Parasnis, Balaji Vishwanath entered the Maratha administration during the reign of Chhatrapati Sambhaji or the regency of his brother, Rajaram. Later, he served as an accountant for the Maratha general, Dhanaji Jadhav, at Janjira. Between 1699 and 1702, he served as the Sar-subhedar or head-administrator at Pune and from 1704 to 1707 as Sarsubedar of Daulatabad. By the time Dhanaji died, Balaji had proven himself as an honest and able officer. Balaji fell out with Dhanaji's son and successor, Chandrarao Jadhav and went over to the newly released Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shahu who took note of his abilities and appointed Balaji as his assistant (c.1708). = Role during Maratha Civil War = * Since the death of Shivaji, his two sons Sambhaji and Rajaram continued the Maratha war against the Mughal Empire. Emperor Aurangzeb entered the Deccan in 1686, hoping to put an end to the fledgling Maratha state. Aurangzeb spent the next 21 years in the Deccan in ceaseless warfare against the Marathas. Despite the cruel executions of Sambhaji and early death of Rajaram, Rajaram's widow Tarabai continued the resistance while Sambhaji's son Shahu was captured at a very young age and held captive of the Mughals. Aurangzeb died at Ahmednagar in 1707 at the age of eighty-eight, with the Mughal armies exhausted and the treasury empty. The ensuing war of succession in the Mughal Empire resulted in accession of the aged Prince Mu'azzam, who ascended the Mughal throne under the title of Bahadur Shah * In the intrigues following the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal governor of the Deccan released Shahu from captivity, hoping to keep the Marathas locked in an internecine struggle between the partisans of Shahu, and Tarabai, the widow of Rajaram who governed in the name of her son Shivaji and denounced Shahu as an impostor substituted by the Mughals for the son of Sambhaji. * Tarabai sent the Maratha Senapati Dhanaji Jadhav to attack Shahu. Balaji Vishwanath was despatched by Dhanaji Jadhav to meet secretly with Shahu and verify his bona fides. Balaji is believed to have persuaded his master to support the cause of Shahu. Dhanaji's forces met Shahu's at Khed, in Pune District. Instead of attacking Shahu, Dhanaji Jadhav declared him to be the rightful successor to the Maratha throne. Dhanaji's confidence in Balaji Vishwanath, however, aroused the jealousy of his son and successor, Chandrasen Jadhav. * After the death of Dhanaji Jadhav in June 1708, Shahu appointed Dhanaji's son Chandrasen Jadhav as Senapati, but the rivalry between Chandrasen and Balaji led the former to intrigue with Tarabai, while seeking an opportunity to eliminate Balaji. A dispute over the conduct of a junior officer in Balaji's employ led Chandrasen to attack Balaji, who fled to the fortress of Purandar. Chandrasen besieged Purandar whereupon Balaji fled again to Pandavgad whence he sent an emissary to plead for help from his sovereign. Shahu had Balaji Vishwanath brought under escort to his capital Satara and asked Chandrasen to make the case against Balaji Vishwanath before him. Instead of obeying Shahu Chandrasen defected to the cause of Tarabai in April 1711. Haibatrao Nimbalkar, who Shahu had dispatched against Chandrasen, also defected to Tarabai, and Shahu's fortunes were an at their lowest. Bereft of his experienced generals, Shahu turned to Balaji Vishwanath, who undertook to raise a new army in the cause of Shahu. For his efforts, Shahu He bestowed Balaji with the title of Senakarte or Organiser of Maratha armies (20 August 1711). * Balaji \\"next turned against Tarabai her own armory of intrigue\\".See Kincaid & Parasnis p151 The fall of Tarabai at Kolhapur in 1712 was the outcome of a conspiracy hatched by Balaji Vishwanath in connivance with the disgruntled elements of Tarabai's court. Balaji Vishwanath induced Rajaram's other widow, Rajasbai to conduct a coup against Shivaji II, the son of Tarabai and install her own son, Sambhaji II, on the throne of Kolhapur. This brought the ruling house of Kolhapur under protection and subordination of Shahu at that time. Appointment as Peshwa A painting of Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa in the Peshwa Memorial at the Parvati Hill temple complex, Pune An information plaque describing Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa, a part of the Peshwa Memorial at Shrivardhan, Konkan Next Shahu turned to subdue the Angres. Tukoji Angre had commanded Chattrapati Shivaji's navy and was succeeded in 1690 by his son Kanhoji Angre. Kanhoji received from Tarabai the title of \\"Sarkhel\\" or Koli Admiral of the Maratha fleet. Kanhoji seized the opportunity of war between Tarabai and Shahu to effectively free himself of the suzerainty of either. Instead, he captured the major trading center of Kalyan and the neighboring forts of Rajmachi and Lohgad. Shahu sent a large force under his \\"Peshwa\\" or Chief Minister, Bahiroji Pingale. Kanhoji defeated Pingle and imprisoned him at Lohagad, and started to advance towards Shahu's capital Satara. Shahu commanded Balaji again to raise another army to subdue Kanhoji. Balaji preferred the path of negotiation and was appointed as Shahu's plenipotentiary to negotiate with the admiral. Balaji and Kanhoji met at Lonavala. The newly appointed Peshwa appealed to the old sailor's patriotism for the Maratha cause. Angre agreed to become the Sarkhel (admiral) of Shahu's navy with control of the Konkan. Balaji and Angre then jointly attacked the Muslim Siddis of Janjira. Their combined forces captured most of the Konkan coast, including Balaji's birthplace of Shrivardhan, which became part of the Angre fiefdom. Delighted with Balaji's success, Shahu dismissed Bahiroji Pingale and appointed Balaji Vishwanath as Peshwa on 16 November 1713.Kincaid & Parasnis, p.156 Northward expansion of the Maratha power There existed a power vacuum in the Mughal empire, caused by the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, and that of his successor Bahadur Shah, leading to continual internecine conflict within the imperial family and the leading Mughal grandees. Farrukhsiyar came to the throne in 1713 with the help of the two powerful nobles, Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan and Sayyid Abdullah Khan. Claiming descent from the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, the Sayyid Brothers had turned king-makers in the Mughal court. Soon after, differences arose between them and the Emperor Farruksiyar. And while the Mughals were intriguing in the civil war between the factions of Shahu and Tarabai, the Marathas themselves became a major factor in the quarrels between the Emperor and the Sayyids. To rid himself of the tutelage of the Sayyids, in 1718 Farrukhsiyar dispatched Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan as Viceroy of the Deccan with orders to restore Mughal authority over the south. Farrukhsiyar sought the patronage of Marathas, which by then had conquered most of India and were planning to dispose of the Mughal throne in Delhi. Hussain Ali Khan found himself harried by the Marathas who resorted to their traditional guerilla tactics. Unable to defeat the Marathas in a pitched battle and weary of chasing after constantly marauding Maratha horsemen, Hussain Ali Khan sought to make peace with the Marathas. In July 1718 Balaji negotiated a Maratha-Mughal treaty with Hussain Ali Khan, demanding the Maratha right of \\"Chauth\\" (literally: 1/4th of revenues) and \\"Sardeshmukhi\\" (an additional 10% of revenues) of the old Mughal provinces of the Deccan. To this Balaji Vishwanath added the demand of Chauth and Sardeshmukhi over the rich provinces of Gujarat and Khandesh, and the restoration of Chattrapati Shivaji's conquests in Karnataka, in return for which Balaji promised that Shahu would acknowledge the nominal overlordship of the Mughal Emperor, and the Marathas would provide a force of 15,000 armed horsemen to the Mughal Empire. To these egregious demands, Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan readily agreed, with a view to utilize the Maratha soldiers to their advantage in their struggle with the Emperor. Farrukhsiyar refused to ratify this treaty and sought to depose and murder the Sayyids. The plot was betrayed to Sayyid Abdulla Khan who was in Delhi, who succeeded in neutralizing other powerful Mughal nobles like Asaf Jah I (also known as Chin Qilich Khan and Nizam-ul-Mulk) and Sarbuland Khan (governor of Patna) with promises of rich governorships of Malwa and Kabul respectively. In September 1718, accompanied by Balaji Vishwanath and supported by (now) sixteen thousand Maratha horsemen commanded by the gallant Parsoji Bhosale Hussain Ali Khan arrived in Delhi. Most of Farrukhsiyar's supporters fled but the Emperor's partisans resisted but were overcome at the cost of two thousand Maratha soldiers. Farrukhsiyar was dethroned, blinded and imprisoned by the Sayyid's, who substituted in his place a more pliable puppet, Rafi-ul-darjat in February 1719. (This hapless prince was dying of tuberculosis and was in turn replaced after a reign of only three months by his older brother Rafi Ud-Daulah.) Rafi-ul-Darjat duly ratified the Maratha treaty. Shahu and his successors were recognized by the Mughal Emperors as the rightful heirs to Chattrapati Shivaji. The Mughals became a puppet government of Marathas and gave a quarter of their total revenue as Chauth and additional 10% for their protection. Conflict with Sambhaji of Kolhapur Shahu I wanted the south part of Kolhapur in his territory. After he defeated Shivaji II of Kolhapur in 1714, Sambhaji II son of Rajasbai became the Chhatrapati of Kolhapur. He ruled his territory with the advice of the Ramchandra Pant Amatya. In 1716 Ramchandra Pant died in Panhala. Now, Sambhaji began to create trouble in the territory of Shahu with the help of Senapati Udaji Chavan and Senakhaskhel Yashwantrao Thorat. The Shirol was under Chavan and the Ashta, Yelvi, Walwa and the wantans in Warana valleys was under Yashwantrao Thorat. After Balaji Vishwanath returned from Delhi with imperial sanads, he decided to March against Sambhaji and Yashwantrao Thorat. He captured Ashta, Yelvi and other village in the Warana valley and went to attack on Panhala fort. At that time Yashwantrao Thorat was ruling his jagir in Vijapur (Bhoom Tahsil, Osmanabad District). He got the news that Balaji Vishwanath captured his jagir in Warana valley and went to attack on Panhala fort. He immediately take some troops with him and went towards Panhala fort. The troops of Peshwa Balaji and Yashwantrao came in front of each other at Apti village near Panhala fort. This battle was fought in 1718. Yashwantrao Thorat was defeated and killed in the battle. Death Balaji returned in triumph from Delhi to Satara, having also secured the release after decades of Mughal captivity, the mother (Yesubai), wife (Savitribai) and half-brother (Madan Singh) of Shahu. Weary from his labors and the tiresome journey back from the imperial capital, Balaji Vishwanath's health began to fail. In October 1719 he obtained leave from Shahu to retire to the village of Saswad near Pune that had been granted by Shahu to the Peshwa. Balaji Vishwanath died on 12 April 1720. He was succeeded by his elder son, the celebrated Baji Rao I, who was appointed Peshwa by Chattrapati Shahu. Administrative Achievements Balaji Vishwanath also laid the foundation for the complex administrative system of the Marathas that held sway for a century after his death. The Maratha tax collection system from a wide swathe of nominally Mughal provinces was based on a widespread network of agents and collectors. \\"To it as much as to their victories in the field the Marathas owed the spread of their empire\\".Kincaid & Parasnis, p181Nayeem, M.A., 1977.

The mechanism of revenue collected was supported by credit facilities from established banking families. Personal life Balaji married Radhabai Barve and had two sons, Baji Rao I and Chimaji Appa. He also had two daughters. The older, Bhiubai married Abaji Joshi of Baramati, brother of the banker Balaji Naik famed as Bajirao I's most tormenting creditor. The younger, Anubai married Venkatrao Ghorpade of Ichalkaranji. Their heirs ruled the state of Ichalkaranji till 1947.

He has been used as both a starting pitcher and a reliever throughout his career, functioning as a \\"swingman.\\" Gaudin has pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Toronto Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, Miami Marlins, and San Francisco Giants. High school Gaudin attended Crescent City Baptist High School in Metairie, Louisiana. He earned All-State and district MVP in his junior and senior years. Professional career =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Minor leagues Gaudin was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays out of high school in the 34th round (1009th overall pick) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed on August 23, 2001, and did not play professionally until 2002. He played in Single-A in 2002 and recorded a 2.26 ERA which ranked him 10th in all of minor league baseball. On July 15, 2003, in his first start after getting called up from the Single-A California League, Gaudin took the mound in the first game of a doubleheader for the Double-A Orlando Rays on the road against the Jacksonville Suns and threw a 7-inning perfect game, retiring all 21 batters he faced. (Two 7-inning games is the standard for a doubleheader in most minor leagues; Major League Baseball would later amend a rule recognizing only efforts of at least nine innings as official perfect games.) Gaudin made only two more starts and posted an 0.47 ERA for Orlando before Devil Rays' Manager Lou Piniella summoned him to the big league club. Major leagues When Gaudin made his major league debut, he became the youngest Devil Ray in club history at 20 years and four months and was the 4th youngest player in the majors. He allowed one run in 2.1 innings in his debut on August 1, 2003, against the Kansas City Royals. After posting a very respectable 2‚Äì0 record and 3.60 ERA in 15 appearances (including 3 starts) in 2003 for the Devil Rays, he went 1‚Äì2 with a 4.85 ERA in 26 appearances (4 starts) in 2004 while splitting time with the Triple-A Durham Bulls. =Toronto Blue Jays= On December 12, 2004, Gaudin was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for backup catcher Kevin Cash. Although he pitched well as a starter at Triple-A Syracuse, he was just 1‚Äì3 with a 13.15 ERA in 5 appearances (3 starts) with the Blue Jays. Opponents had batted .470 against him in just 13 innings (31 hits). =Oakland Athletics= On December 5, 2005, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics for a player to be named later, who later turned out to be outfielder Dustin Majewski. Gaudin with the Oakland Athletics in 2006. Gaudin began the 2006 season for the Sacramento River Cats, the Athletics Triple-A team. He was recalled by the Athletics after posting an 0.36 ERA in 4 starts for the River Cats and pitched in relief for the rest of the season for the big league club. In his first season as an Athletic, he posted various career highs and his ERA (3.08) and opponents batting average were the lowest of his career. His inherited runners to score was 20 percent, which ranked fourth lowest in the American League. In 2007, Gaudin was converted into a starter again when veteran Esteban Loaiza was on the disabled list to begin the season. He pitched in a team high and career high 34 starts, posting career highs in wins (11), innings pitched (199.1), strikeouts (154) and walks (100). His excellent performance as a starter in the 2007 season made him part of the new 'Big Three' that included Dan Haren and Joe Blanton. In December 2007, Gaudin successfully had his sesamoid bone removed from the base of his big toe in a procedure called a sesamoidectomy. He was back on the mound pitching again within three months. Gauding began the 2008 season in the rotation, appearing in 6 starts. On May 7, 2008, Gaudin was moved back into the bullpen. He went 5-3 in 26 games along with 6 starts for the A's before being traded. =Chicago Cubs= Gaudin with the Chicago Cubs in 2008.

His main one is a four-seam fastball at 90‚Äì93 mph. He also has a two- seamer at 89‚Äì92, a slider at 79‚Äì82, and a changeup at 86‚Äì89. His slider is mainly used against right-handed hitters (especially with 2 strikes), while his changeup is used almost exclusively against lefties. Personal life Gaudin is married to Syndal Gorden since January 29, 2011. The couple appeared on an episode of House Hunters. Syndal chose her wedding gown on an episode of Say Yes to the Dress entitled The Group Calls It. She was accompanied to Kleinfeld's by Yankee wives Amber (Mrs. C.C.) Sabathia and Karen (Mrs. A.J.) Burnett and a friend, Tara Neal, who picked her dress for her. When the episode was aired, Gaudin was with the Nationals. Gaudin learned how to throw a slider in Little League, when a coach showed him the curveball grip. In July 2013, it was reported that Gaudin had been charged with lewdness stemming from an incident in January. While in the emergency room of Desert Springs Hospital, it was alleged that Gaudin groped a woman while she was laying on a gurney. In September he pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and impulse control counselling.

History  SX-70 Model 2 with film cartridge protruding from the front SX-70 Sonar One Step A fully collapsed SX-70 In 1947, Polaroid introduced its first consumer camera. The Land Camera Model 95 was the first camera to use instant film to quickly produce photographs without developing them in a laboratory. The popular Model 95 and subsequent Land Cameras required complex procedures to take and produce good photographs. Photographic paper had to be manually removed from cameras, peeled open after 60 seconds, needed several minutes to dry, and often left developing chemicals on hands. The instructions for the Model 20 Swinger, introduced in 1965, warned that, if not followed, \\"you‚Äôre headed for plenty of picture taking trouble\\". Pictures from the SX-70, by contrast, ejected automatically and developed quickly (fully within 10 minutes) without chemical residue. Polaroid founder Edwin H. Land announced the SX-70 at a company annual meeting in April 1972. On stage, he took out a folded SX-70 from his suit coat pocket and in ten seconds took five pictures, both actions impossible with previous Land Cameras. The company first sold the SX-70 in Miami, Florida in late 1972, and began selling it nationally in fall 1973. Although the high cost of $180 for the camera and $6.90 for each film pack of ten pictures ($ and $, respectively, adjusted for inflation) limited demand, Polaroid sold 700,000 by mid-1974. In 1973-4, the Skylab 3 and 4 astronauts used an SX-70 to photograph a video display screen to be able to compare the Sun's features from one orbit to the next. There were a variety of models beginning in 1972 with the original SX-70, though all shared the same basic design. The first model had a plain focusing screen (the user was expected to be able to see the difference between in- and out-of focus) because Dr. Land wanted to encourage photographers to think they were looking at the subject, rather than through a viewfinder. When many users complained that focusing was difficult, especially in dim light, a split-image rangefinder prism was added. This feature is standard on all later manual focus models. The later Sonar OneStep (introduced in 1978) and SLR 680 models were equipped with a sonar autofocus system. This sonar autofocus system greatly helped the user's ability to focus the camera, especially in dark environments, and could be turned off if manual focus was needed. The Sonar OneStep models were the first autofocus SLRs available to consumers. The later SLR 680/690 models updated the basic design of the Sonar OneStep to more modern standards by incorporating support for newer 600 film cartridges instead of SX-70 cartridges, and a built-in flash instead of the disposable \\"Flash Bar\\". Today they are the most evolved forms of the SX-70, and are highly sought after by Polaroid enthusiasts. Though expensive, the SX-70 was popular in the 1970s and retains a cult following today.\\"Polaroid instant film is back ... sort of\\", CNN, SciTechBlog, March 25, 2010 Photographers such as Ansel Adams, Andy Warhol, Helmut Newton, and Walker Evans praised and used the SX-70. Helmut Newton used the camera for fashion shoots. Walker Evans began using the camera in 1973 when he was 70 years old. Not until the $40 Model 1000 OneStep using SX-70 film became the best-selling camera of the 1977 Christmas shopping season, however, did its technology become truly popular. More recently, it was the inspiration for the Belfast alternative band SX-70's name. Design features The SX-70 included many sophisticated design elements. A collapsible SLR required a complex light path for the viewfinder, with three mirrors (including one Fresnel reflector) of unusual, aspheric shapes set at odd angles to create an erect image on the film and an erect aerial image for the viewfinder.Plummer, William T., \\"Unusual optics of the Polaroid SX-70 Land camera\\", Appl. Opt. 21, 196-208 (1982) Many mechanical parts were precision plastic moldings. The body was made of glass-filled polysulfone, a rigid plastic which was plated with a thin layer of copper-nickel-chromium alloy to give a metallic appearance. Models 2 & 3 used ABS in either Ebony or Ivory color. The film pack contained a flat, 6-volt \\"PolaPulse\\" battery to power the camera electronics, drive motor and flash. The original flash system, a disposable \\"Flash Bar\\" of 10 bulbs (five on each side, with the user rotating the bar half way through) from General Electric, used logic circuits to detect and fire the next unused flash. Models Although a variety of models were offered, all share the same basic design. All SX-70 models feature a folding body design, a 4-element 116 mm f/8 glass lens, and an automatic exposure system. The cameras allow for focusing as close as 10.4 inches (26.4 cm), and have a shutter speed range from 1/175 s to more than 10 seconds. The Model 3 departs from the other models since it isn't a SLR, but instead has the viewfinder cut into the mirror hood. A whole array of accessories could be utilized with SX-70 cameras, such as a close-up lens (1:1 @ 5 inches), electrical remote shutter release, tripod mount and an Ever-Ready carrying case that hung from the neck and unfolded in concert with the camera. A lot of the technology used in the folding SX-70 cameras was later used in the production of rigid \\"box\\" type SX-70 cameras, such as the Model 1000 OneStep, Pronto, Presto and The Button. These models, although also utilizing SX-70 film, are very different from the folding SLR SX-70s. Evolution MiNT Camera modified SX-70 into SLR670a (it uses 600 film directly without adding a neutral-density filter) and SLR670m (the only SX-70 with shutter priority mode). New features include the Time Machine add-on (manual shutter speed from 1/2000s to 1s as well as bulb mode) for the SLR670-S and the SLR670m, 600 film (ISO 640) compatibility under the \\"Auto 600\\" mode. The SLR670a allows for additional shutter/brightness control. MiNT also produces flash bars and filter lenses intended for the SX-70. OpenSX70 is a project to replace the printed circuit board (PCB) on the SX-70 with a modern open-source design based on Arduino. , a working prototype is available with some experimental 3D-printed enclosures. The new PCB also features an LED indicator and an audio jack for firing an external flash. Film  Polaroid SX-70 film has a ~3.1 x 3.1 in¬≤ (77 x 77 mm) square image area and a ~4.2 x 3.5 in¬≤ (108 x 88 mm¬≤) total area. Each film pack holds 10 films. It was introduced in 1972, and was a market success despite some problems with the batteries on early film packs. The original SX-70 film was improved once in the mid-1970s (New Improved Faster Developing!) and replaced in 1980 by the further advanced \\"SX-70 Time- Zero Supercolor\\" product, in which the layers in the film card were altered to allow a much faster development time (hence the \\"time zero\\"). It also had richer, brighter colors than the original 1972 product. There were also professional market varieties of the SX-70 film including 778 (Time Zero equivalent) and the similar 708, Time Zero film without a battery, intended for use in applications such as the \\"Face Place\\" photo booth and professional or laboratory film-backs, where a battery is not needed. Time Zero was the film manufactured up until 2005, though overseas-market and some last run film packs were marked only as SX-70. A feature of the SX-70 film packs was a built-in battery to power the camera motors and exposure control, ensuring that a charged battery would always be available as long as film was in the camera. The \\"Polapulse\\" battery was configured as a 6 volt thin flat battery, and used zinc chloride chemistry to provide for the high pulse demand of the camera motors.New Batteries: Flat packs, lead-acid Ds, 150-minute ni-cads, chlorine power, Popular Science October 1973, page 102, Google books preview, Retrieved April 27, 2010 Polaroid later released development kits to allow the Polapulse battery to be used in non-photographic applications. In the 1980s, the company even produced small \\"600\\" AM/FM radios that would run on film packs in which the film cards had been exhausted, but the battery still had enough power to be reused.\\"Polapulse battery\\" (archived 2009) The Polaroid 600 series film, introduced in 1981, has the same film format and cartridge as that of the SX-70 but features a higher film speed at ISO 640. The 2-stop difference in sensitivity can be compensated in an SX-70 by using a ND-filter or through circuit modifications that change the exposure time. MiNT Camera produces modified SX-70s that can take the higher-sensitivity film. = Supply issues = Polaroid's SX-70 \\"Time-Zero\\" film was phased out of production in late 2005 to early 2006 (differing according to regional markets). Small quantities of the film may still be acquired, at a variety of prices given the film's expiration dates, on e-auction sites. After Polaroid ceased manufacturing instant film in 2008, the Impossible Project (now Polaroid B.V.) began formulating replacements using equipment acquired when the original manufacturing facilities closed. Polaroid produces lines of black and white and color film compatible with the SX-70, though their films use a different chemistry than original Polaroid film and have different characteristics. Polaroid also make film for 600 and newer \\"I-Type\\" cameras. Image manipulation Chevy Nova One feature of SX-70 integral print film is its ability to be manipulated while developing, and for some days after. Because the emulsion is gelatin-based, and the Mylar covering does not allow water vapor to readily pass, the emulsion stays soft for several days, allowing people to press and manipulate the emulsion to produce effects somewhat like impressionist paintings. An example of this technique was used on the cover of Peter Gabriel's third self-titled album from 1980. Another example of emulsion manipulation was the cover of Loverboy's debut album, Loverboy. Greek-American artist Lucas Samaras created a series of self-portraits titled \\"Photo- Transformations\\" (1973-76) which employed extensive use of emulsion manipulation techniques. The 500, 600, and Spectra/Image materials do not use a gelatin-based emulsion, and cannot be manipulated this way. Manipulation of the photograph is best done about two minutes after the picture has fully developed. It will stay soft and workable for about 5‚Äì15 minutes. Some colors will be more difficult to work on (dark green), whereas others are workable for a long time (red). If the photograph is on a warm surface or slightly warmed in an oven, image manipulation is made easier.

Niblett debuted in 2001 with her first full-length studio album Sweet Heart Fever, and has gone on to release five more studio albums. In 2013, Niblett released her sixth studio album, It's Up to Emma, which she mixed and produced. Niblett's music is frequently minimalist in style, many of her songs consisting merely of vocals accompanied by either drums or guitar. She is also known for her intimate live shows.Morris, Kurt. [ Biography]. Allmusic. Retrieved 23 February 2006. In addition to songwriting and music, Niblett is also a professional astrologer, and often incorporates astrological themes into her song lyrics. Early life and education Niblett was born in Stone, Staffordshire, England, and was raised in the nearby historic market town of Rugeley. She was classically trained on piano and violin as a child. Niblett began recording compositions she made up on the piano as a child, and later in early adulthood on the guitar. She studied music, fine art and performance art at Nottingham Trent University. Career =2000s= Niblett began performing at clubs in Nottingham while attending college. She chose her stage name in honour of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, the protagonist in Harper Lee's 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird. After sending out her EP demo CD \\"Alene Had It All\\" (recorded under the name Lion, and accompanied by drummer Kristian Godard), consisting of vocals, guitar, and drums, to multiple record companies, Niblett was approached by Secretly Canadian, who had been given her demos by Jason Molina of Songs: Ohia. The following year, Niblett released a 7\\" split-single with Songs: Ohia, contributing the track \\"Miss My Lion\\". Niblett followed the single with her debut album, Sweet Heart Fever, released by Secretly Canadian in 2001, which she recorded at Chem Nineteen Recordings in Hamilton, Scotland with producer Andy Miller.

You don't have to be in the industry there and you do [in England], so I had to leave\\". She has resided in Portland, Oregon since 2005. =2010s= In 2010, Niblett released her fifth studio album, The Calcination of Scout Niblett, marking her debut release with Drag City. The album received positive critical reviews from Pitchfork and Spin, who noted: \\"[Niblett's] minimal songs ‚Äì just one guitar and sporadic drums ‚Äì unfold laboriously, as though forcing themselves from Niblett's clenched mouth and hands.\\" Niblett followed this with a single, No More Nasty Scrubs, in 2012, which featured covers of TLC's \\"No Scrubs\\" and \\"Nasty\\" by Janet Jackson. Her sixth studio album, It's Up to Emma, which she recorded in Portland, Oregon, and mixed the record herself. It was released on 21 May 2013 also on Drag City, and received positive critical acclaim from Pitchfork, Allmusic, and NME. Music and influences Niblett live at Primavera Sound Festival, 2010 Niblett's unorthodox musical arrangements have been noted by critics, particularly her sparse instrumentation and dramatic shifts in tempos. In her earlier work, specifically I Am and Kidnapped by Neptune, many of Niblett's songs consisted of vocals accompanied only by drums; \\"[I wanted to] make drumming and singing be as accessible as me playing guitar and singing,\\" she said in a 2004 interview. Her later albums featured Niblett mainly on guitar, and with a backing drummer. Niblett cites among her influences a number of grunge period bands, including Mudhoney, Sonic Youth and Nirvana, and in particular the guitar of Kurt Cobain. She also stated that she was largely influenced by Hole's first record, Pretty on the Inside (1991): \\"I was seventeen when I first heard it. For me, the thing that I loved about them and her (Courtney Love) was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side,\\" said Niblett. \\"That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, [and] ethereal.\\" Her drumming technique, however, is inspired, she says, by a man who played at an open-mic night in Nottingham and would accompany himself on the drums while playing Beatles covers.Liss, Sarah (28 Jul 2005). \\"Cosmic Scout \\". NOW Magazine, Vol. 24, No. 48. This drumming technique has been a particularly distinctive feature of Niblett's records with Steve Albini, whose method is to place the drums centrally in the mix. An example of Niblett's minimalist approach to songwriting is \\"Your Beat Kicks Back Like Death\\", included on I Am and as the B-side to \\"I'll Be a Prince.\\" It consists solely of a drumbeat with a cheerfully delivered repeating lyric, \\"We're all gonna die!\\", eventually concluding, \\"We don't know when, We don't know how.\\" According to Niblett, she had originally composed the song on guitar after nearly getting in a car accident while on tour during a winter storm.Too Pure.

Personal life Niblett seldom discusses her personal life. Apart from her career in music, she has an obsessive interest in astrology and is also a professional astrologer. \\"My dad bought me a book about astrology when I was about seven and I literally haven't stopped studying it since,\\" she said. Themes and references to planets occasionally appear in Niblett's lyrics, and she explained the naming of her third album, Kidnapped by Neptune: \\"The reason that album was called Kidnapped by Neptune was because Neptune was what they call 'transiting my ascendant' at the time and it literally did feel like I didn't know who I was. The energies of Neptune are dissolving your ego and it really kind of shakes you up. Right now Pluto, but also Uranus are equally battling, challenging my Sun.\\" She also is said to use astrology to predict the best place and time to record her music.

Rodowicz then took up a job in the electrical workshop of engineer Tadeusz Czarnecki, and then in the Radio Workshop of Philips. In 1941, after completing a course in mechanical and electrical engineering, he began his studies at the Secondary School of Electrical Engineering, which he graduated from in 1943, Rodowicz continuously maintained his underground activity. From July to December 1942, he took part in the second turn of the Substitute Course of the Officers' School of Infantry Reserves ZWZ-AK \\"Agricola\\", after which he obtained the rank of platoon officer cadet. Rodowicz had also completed courses in combat training and great diversion. In November 1942 he became the deputy commander of the 2nd team of Feliks Pendelski alias \\"Felek\\" at the Centre Troup of Grey Ranks Assault Groups. Rodowicz took an active part in many combat operations: * 26 March 1943 - Operation \\"Mexico II\\" (Operation Arsenal) - liberation from the hands of the Gestapo of Jan Bytnar \\"Rudy\\" and all the prisoners transported with him from the Gestapo headquarters at J. Ch. Szucha Avenue 25 to the Pawiak prison; \\"Anoda\\" had commanded the \\"Bottles\\" section, and during his retreat rescued Aleksy Dawidowski, who was attacked by a German civilian.

From May to July 1944, Rodowicz stayed with his platoon in the forests of the White Wilderness in the region of Wyszk√≥w, conducting intensive military training. He returned to Warsaw at the end of July. Jan Rodowicz (on the right) with his colleagues - S≈Çawomir Szymankiewicz \\"Czarnota\\" (left) and J√≥zef Saski \\"Katoda\\" (middle) = Participation in the Warsaw Uprising = During the uprising Rodowicz initially fought in the Wola District as a deputy commander of the 3rd platoon \\"Felek\\" of the 2nd company \\"Rudy\\" of the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalion, which was a part of the group of Kedyw KG AK commanded by Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz \\"Rados≈Çaw\\". On 2 August, together with the 2nd and 4th platoon teams \\"Felek\\", Rodowicz took part in the occupation of the school building at 13 Spokojna Street in the vicinity of the Powazki Cemetery. He was particularly notable for his fight for the cemeteries on 8 August, during the counteroffensive of the \\"Felek\\" platoon, led from the Evangelical Cemetery in the direction of Mlynarska and So≈Çtyka Streets. The platoon forced the Germans out of the cemetery and began to occupy parts of So≈Çtyka and M≈Çynarska Streets, and at the same time capturing significant amounts of weapons and inflicting large losses on the enemy. On 9 August, Rodowicz was seriously injured in his left lung during an attack on the school building at 13 Spokojna Street. He was transported to the John of God Hospital at 12 Bonifraterska Street in the Old Town, and then to the battalion hospital at 23 Miodowa Street. On 11 August for his outstanding role in combat within the \\"North\\" Group, Rodowicz received the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari V Class. He was also promoted to the rank of lieutenant. On 31 August, during the evacuation of the Old Town, Rodowicz walked through the sewers with a group of wounded soldiers of the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalion to the Downtown-North District. Until 8 September, he was being treated in the hospital at 36 Ho≈ºa Street, from where he joined his unit in the Upper Czerniak√≥w. On 15 September, during the last defense of the units of \\"Brody 53\\" Rodowicz was injured again. This time in the left arm and shoulder with a bone crack. On the next day, on his way to the hospital, he was hit yet again in his left hand with shards. On the night of 17‚Äì18 September, soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Regiment from the 1st Army of the Polish Army commanded by General Zygmunt Berling, evacuated him on a pontoon across the Vistula River to the Prague District. = Post-war period = Memorial plaque on the first floor of the building of the Faculty of Architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology at 55 Koszykowa Street After a long treatment in the Otwock hospital, Rodowicz came to his family in Milan√≥wek at the beginning of 1945. There, he established a contact with his former colleagues from the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalion, who survived the Warsaw Uprising, including Henryk Koz≈Çowski \\"Kmita\\", former acting commander of the 1st company \\"Maciek\\". Thanks to him, Rodowicz became the commander of the dispatch unit of the Head of the Central District of the Delegation of the Armed Forces, Colonel J. Mazurkiewicz. Rodowicz led propaganda campaigns against the communist government, gathered information on public security offices, prisons and protected briefings of the DAF command. In August 1945, after the dissolution of the DAF and his unit, Rodowicz hid some of the weapons. He then moved to Warsaw, where his family received an apartment. He took care of former soldiers of the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalion, exhumations and funerals of killed comrades in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery and also created designated insurgent quarters. On September 19, as a result of the call of Col. J. Mazurkiewicz, Rodowicz revealed himself in front of the Liquidation Committee of the former Home Army Central District. He worked briefly in the office of the Liquidation Committee. Rodowicz used this time to prepare, with the help of his colleagues from the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalion, lists of fallen and missing soldiers of the Battalion. He also initiated the creation of the \\"Zo≈õka\\" Battalionon Archives. He encouraged and persuaded his colleagues to look for and secure historical materials about the unit and write memoirs. In the autumn of 1945, Rodowicz began studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology, after which he moved to the second year of the Faculty of Architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology in 1947. Jan Rodowicz's grave at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery, Warsaw On 24 December 1948, Rodowicz was arrested by officers of the Ministry of Public Security, who were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Herer, Head of the Department IV at the Department V of the Ministry of Public Security. Rodowicz died on 7 January 1949 during a brutal investigation at the Ministry headquarters at Koszykowa Street. According to the prosecutor and the Security Office, the reason for his death was a suicide jump from the window on the fourth floor of the building. It is possible that he was thrown out of it, or murdered in some other circumstances.In 1968, mother of \\"Anoda\\" - Zofia Rodowicz, wrote in her memoirs that she had been secretly contacted by the director of the Hospital of the Infant Jesus, Dr. Konrad Okolski (father of \\"Kuba\\" - a friend of \\"Anoda\\"), who gave her the opinion of Prof. Grzywo- DƒÖbrowski, head of the Department of Forensic Medicine in Warsaw at 6 Oczki Street, where the autopsy of Jan was carried out. This report showed that Jan did not commit suicide, but was murdered during the investigation. \\"He had a crushed chest, which was not mentioned in the protocol\\". The protocol stated that the cause of death was haemorrhage from the main artery caused by jumping out of the window. Professor Grzywo-DƒÖbrowski did not want to sign the protocol and was later prosecuted because of it. In 1991, at the request of Jan‚Äôs family, which was convinced that he had been murdered, the Minister of Justice, Wies≈Çaw Chrzanowski, ordered that the investigation be resumed. In the spring of 1995, Jan's remains were exhumed and examined at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Warsaw. The cause of death could not be determined and the prosecutor Stefan Szustakiewicz discontinued further proceedings\\". On 12 January 1949, his body was secretly transported to a funeral facility and then anonymously buried at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery. His family was not notified of his death until March 1. On March 16, the family was informed by the gravedigger about the burial place and exhumed the body. The coffin was placed in a family grave at Stare PowƒÖzki. A symbolic grave is also located in the \\"≈ÅƒÖczka\\" quarters of the Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

His uncle Michael O'Sullivan, a member of the 1st Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army, was bayoneted to death by British forces in 1921. After his vocational school education, he trained as a woodwork teacher in a college in County Wexford. He had a wife (Deirdre), a son (Feargal) and two daughters (Ciara and D√≠√≥g). He joined the republican movement at 17 years of age and took part in the IRA Border Campaign. On 1 January 1957 he was second-in-command of the Pearse Column which carried out the raid on Brookeborough Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Barracks in County Fermanagh, in which Se√°n South and Fergal O'Hanlon were killed. He was arrested by the Garda S√≠och√°na and imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison for six months. Upon release, he was interned in the Curragh. On 27 September 1958 he escaped along with Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh and went on the run. With most of the IRA leadership under arrest or interned, √ì Br√°daigh (who had been on the Army Council at the start of the campaign) became IRA chief of staff and √ì Conaill became IRA Director of Operations and joined the IRA Army Council.Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, pp. 84‚Äì85. In an altercation with the RUC and B Specials near Lough Neagh in 1959, he was shot and badly injured and later captured by the RUC. On recovery he received an eight-year sentence and remained in Belfast Prison until he was released unconditionally in September 1963. In the October 1961 Irish general election, √ì Conaill ran as a Sinn F√©in candidate in the Cork Borough constituency. Winning 1,956 first preference votes (a share of 5.24 per cent), he just missed taking the fifth and final seat.ElectionsIreland .com Upon release, √ì Conaill took up residence in Glencolmcille, County Donegal, where he taught. He also married Deirdre Caffrey, Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh's cousin. √ì Conaill worked closely with Fr. James McDyer who was active in rural development. During the late 1960s, √ì Conaill played little part in the activities of the IRA or Sinn F√©in. With the outbreak of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, √ì Conaill would become a prominent spokesperson for the Provisional IRA. He was active in the IRA through the 1960s, and IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding appointed him the Officer Commanding (O/C) of the Donegal unit prior to the IRA's Convention in December 1969; √ì Conaill was also a member of the IRA's Army Council after Goulding expanded that body at the IRA Convention late in 1968. In the autumn of 1969, √ì Conaill, upset with the then IRA leadership, walked out of the \\"unit convention\\" and was suspended.Robert White, \\"Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 149 and notes, p. 366, . Sides with Provisional IRA √ì Conaill's gravestone in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. √ì Conaill helped form the Provisional IRA after the 1969 IRA split, served on the first Provisional IRA Army Council, and was the Provisional IRA's Director of Publicity. In 1970 he travelled to New York and was instrumental in establishing Irish Northern Aid or NORAID, which raised funds for the Provisionals. In 1971 he travelled to Prague and purchased 4.5 tons of small arms from the Czechoslovakia state arms marketing company, Omnipol. The consignment was later seized in Schiphol Airport, Netherlands. Despite his belief in the armed campaign, √ì Conaill was not solely a militarist. He was deeply involved in the drafting of the √âire Nua policy, working with Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh, which was launched by Sinn F√©in in June 1972. He also played a leading role in the truce negotiations between the IRA and the British government in June‚ÄìJuly 1972. On 13 June 1972, he appeared at an IRA press conference in Derry, along with Se√°n Mac Stiof√°in, Seamus Twomey and Martin McGuinness, which announced an IRA cease-fire proposal, and gave William Whitelaw forty-eight hours to make a decision. On 20 June 1972, he represented the IRA along with Gerry Adams at secret talks at the home of Colonel Sir Michael McCorkell, Ballyarnett, County Londonderry. The British representatives were Frank Steele, who presented himself as a government official but was an MI6 agent, and Philip John Woodfield of the Northern Ireland Office. The meeting lasted four hours and the British side informed the IRA representatives that while Whitelaw refused to offer political status, he was prepared to suspend arrests of republicans and searches of homes. Both sides then agreed to call a ten-day ceasefire. In a report, Woodfield noted that \\"There is no doubt whatever that these two at least genuinely want a ceasefire and a permanent end to violence,\\" and of √ì Conaill and Adams that the \\"appearance and manner of the men was respectable and respectful\\". \\"Their response to every argument was reasonable and moderate. (‚Ä¶) Their behaviour and attitude appeared to bear no relation to the indiscriminate campaigns of bombing and shooting in which they have both been prominent leaders.\\"Adams and IRA's secret Whitehall talks, BBC On 26 June the IRA called a \\"bilateral truce\\". On 7 July he was part of the IRA delegation which met with representatives of the British government in London (see article on Se√°n Mac Stiof√°in for more details). After the collapse of the IRA-British government contacts, √ì Conaill maintained informal contacts with Sir John Hackett, by then retired and Principal of King's College London, and who had been the commanding officer of British forces in Northern Ireland. In September 1973, Hackett reported to Woodfield of the Northern Ireland Office that √ì Conaill was \\"losing ground to younger and more impatient operators. To arrest him and remove him from the scene would loosen restraint on those and open the way for more irresponsible action.\\"The general, the IRA leader and the plot to assassinate Edward Heath The Guardian In 1974, at a secret meeting arranged by journalist Kevin Myers, √ì Conaill and Brian Keenan had talks with Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leaders Billy Mitchell and Jim Hanna in Lough Sheelin, County Cavan. Myers summarised the purpose of the talks: The IRA simply wished to discuss the terms of the loyalist surrender and the loyalists wished merely to assure the IRA they had no intention of surrendering.Kevin Myers, Caught between the devils and the IRA, The Sunday Times, 22 October 2006 The meeting lasted four hours. Mitchell later recalled that \\"We just wanted to get to know one another. And we thought we could find a way to call an end to everything.\\" \\"I really liked David. And neither of us accused the other of anything\\".Nordirland, Die Zeit In an interview with Mary Holland on London Weekend Television's Weekend World on 17 November 1974, √ì Conaill claimed there would be an escalation of IRA violence. Four days later on 21 November the IRA detonated bombs in two pubs in Birmingham, killing 21 civilians. This was not what √ì Conaill had intended, as the Provisional IRA leadership did not endorse indiscriminate bombing in England.Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, 2006, Indiana University Press. The interview and the attacks led to the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the United Kingdom.The Troubles , BFI The interview prompted hostile questions in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Although √ì Conaill was on the run for much of the early 1970s, he managed to make some public appearances. In 1973, he gave the oration at the Easter Rising commemoration in Belfast, and the following year he spoke at the funeral of IRA hunger striker Michael Gaughan in Ballina. While on the run he was prominent in arranging the Feakle talks with Protestant clergymen in December 1974. In 1975 √ì Conaill was regularly consulted by Republican representatives who negotiated a truce with British representatives, including Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh and Billy McKee, but he did not meet with the British representatives.Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, p. 239. √ì Conaill was Officer Commanding (O/C) of the IRA Southern Command for much of the early 1970s until his arrest in July 1975. (He was replaced by Pat Doherty). He was found guilty of IRA membership and imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison, where in 1977 he was one of 20 men who took part in a 47-day hunger strike in protest at conditions in the jail. On 18 April 1976, he and his son Feargal took part in a parade to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising in Drumboe, Stranorlar, Co.Donegal Soon after the July 1982 bombings that killed 11 soldiers in London, he spoke at a rally in Monaghan and threatened more bombs in Britain.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/02/obituaries/david-o- connell-53-reputed-chief-of-ira.html Involvement in Sinn F√©in electoral campaigns Upon his release from prison, he was active in the Anti H-Block Movement. Contrary to popular opinion, it was √ì Conaill and not Gerry Adams who proposed that Bobby Sands contest the Westminster by-election for Fermanagh and South Tyrone during the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike.

He was the director of elections in the June 1981 Irish general election in which two prisoners were elected to D√°il √âireann: hunger striker Kieran Doherty in the Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan constituency and prison protester Paddy Agnew in the Louth constituency. In 1983, along with Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh, he resigned from the position of vice-president of Sinn F√©in in opposition to the dropping of the √âire Nua policy. Joins Republican Sinn F√©in At the 1986 Sinn F√©in Ard Fheis, he opposed the decision to drop abstentionism to Leinster House. He joined in the walk out led by √ì Br√°daigh and was chairman of Republican Sinn F√©in from 1986 to 1987 and subsequently a vice-president of the party. Three days before his death he wrote a document entitled Towards a Peaceful Ireland, which offered a traditionalist republican solution to Irish partition. Death On 1 January 1991, his family found him dead at his home in Dublin. He had gone to bed complaining of feeling ill. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery where a commemoration is held annually.

Released in 2003, it was the only single to be released from their eighth studio album The Curse of Blondie. The single was released as part of a two-CD set and on vinyl. CD 1 features live versions of \\"Maria\\" and \\"Rapture\\", plus the video for \\"Good Boys\\" directed by Jonas √Ökerlund. CD 2 featured a remix by Giorgio Moroder. The 12-inch vinyl featured remixes by Giorgio Moroder, Arthur Baker, and Scissor Sisters. Promotion included several TV performances in the United Kingdom (Top of the Pops) and the United States (The Today Show, David Letterman, etc.) It charted at number 7 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play charts (the last original Blondie single to chart in any Billboard component until \\"Fun\\" hit No. 1 in 2017). The single peaked at number 12 in the UK. The Australian single release coincided with the band's 2003 tour of the country, peaking at number 37 and becoming their first top 40 hit there as a group since \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" in 1982. The single peaked at number 93 in Germany. \\"Good Boys\\" was the final single from the band for eight years. Songwriting credits Although not credited on the original single release, Brian May of the British rock band Queen was later credited as a co-writer because Debbie Harry used lyrics that were similar to those of Queen's 1977 hit \\"We Will Rock You\\" for the rap section. Although the lyrics are not entirely identical, Queen threatened to sue, as was explained by Harry and fellow Blondie member Chris Stein on a VH1 special. The lyrics used in \\"Good Boys\\" were \\"You got me on your face / A big disgrace / Shakin' your feathers all over the place.\\" While the lyrics from \\"We Will Rock You\\" are \\"You got mud on your face / You big disgrace / Kicking your can all over the place.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Good Boys\\" was directed by Jonas √Ökerlund. Filmed partly in black and white and partly in color, the video starts out in the style of an old silent film, with a title screen that presents the band, the song, and the director. Debbie Harry appears in a brunette wig, playing a ringmaster conducting the band in a vintage circus setting, intercut with scenes of a circus drama in which a clown is thrown inside a cage with a tiger and mauled to death. There's also a \\"blond\\" version, where Harry doesn't wear the brunette wig. √Ökerlund also made an over 8 minutes silent short film also entitled \\"Good Boys\\" extending the clown story.

Over a million game cartridges were sold. Activision later ported the title to the Atari 5200, ColecoVision, and Intellivision consoles, as well as to the Commodore 64, IBM PCjr, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and Atari 8-bit family. Shaw did the Atari 8-bit and Atari 5200 ports herself. Activision published a less successful sequel in 1988 without Shaw's involvement. Gameplay Original Atari 2600 version Viewed from a top-down perspective, the player flies a fighter jet over the River of No Return in a raid behind enemy lines. The player's jet can only move left and right--it cannot maneuver up and down the screen--but it can accelerate and decelerate. The player's jet crashes if it collides with the riverbank or an enemy craft, or if the jet runs out of fuel. Assuming fuel can be replenished, and if the player evades damage, gameplay is essentially unlimited. The player scores points for shooting enemy tankers (30 points), helicopters (60 points), fuel depots (80 points), jets (100 points), and bridges (500 points). The jet refuels when it flies over a fuel depot. A bridge marks the end of a game level. Non-Atari 2600 ports of the game add hot air balloons that are worth 60 points when shot as well as tanks along the sides of the river that shoot at the player's jet. Destroying bridges also serve as the game's checkpoints. If the player crashes the plane they will start their next jet at the last destroyed bridge. Development For its time, River Raid provided an inordinate amount of non-random, repeating terrain despite constrictive computer memory limits. For the Atari 2600 the game with its program code and graphics had to fit into a 4 KB ROM. The game program does not actually store the sequence of terrain and other objects. Instead, a procedural generation algorithm manifests them by employing a linear feedback shift register with a hard-coded starting value, also called a pseudorandom number generator. Because of this the algorithm generates the same game world every time the program executes. The enemy crafts' AI relies on another pseudorandom number generator to make the start of the enemy movement less predictable as this pseudorandom number generator's starting value is not reset when a new game starts. Reception InfoWorld in 1983 stated that River Raid might be the best Atari 8-bit game of the year, \\"more challenging than any VCS version\\" and superior to others like Caverns of Mars. Antic in 1984 said that the Atari 8-bit version was identical to the 2600 original, but with slightly \\"spiffed up ... game visuals\\". The Deseret News in 1984 called River Raid \\"one of the most playable and entertaining of all war games\\". The newspaper gave the ColecoVision version four stars, recommending it to all console owners and describing it as \\"a definite winner all the way\\". The game received the award for \\"1984 Best Action Videogame\\" and a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Best Computer Action Game\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards, where the judges described it as \\"provid[ing] the brand of non- stop excitement the blast brigaders adore\\". River Raid was the first video game to be banned for minors in West Germany by the Federal Department for Writings Harmful to Young Persons (German: Bundespr√ºfstelle f√ºr jugendgef√§hrdende Schriften). Legacy In 1996, Next Generation listed the Atari 2600 version as number 81 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Nostalgia aside, the 2600 sucks. ... But this game is still great, for one main reason: Level design.\\" Activision published the relatively obscure River Raid II for the Atari 2600 in 1988. This sequel, programmed by David Lubar based on a concept by Dan Kitchen, has similar gameplay, but with a different landscape and increased difficulty. In 1995 River Raid was published for Microsoft Windows as part of Activision's Atari 2600 Action Pack.http://uk.ign.com/games/activisions-atari-2600-action-pack/pc-724812 References External links * River Raid for the Atari 2600 at Atari Mania * River Raid for the Atari 8-bit family at Atari Mania * * Category:1982 video games Category:Activision games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 5200 games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:ColecoVision games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Intellivision games Category:MSX games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Censored video games Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"River Raid"},{"id":"2354702","text":"Portrait of Gutierre de Cetina (ca. 1599) by Francisco Pacheco Gutierre de Cetina (1519‚Äì1554) was a Spanish poet and soldier. Biography Cetina was born at Seville. He was the brother of Beltr√°n and Gregorio de Cetina, lesser known conquistadors. He served under Charles V in Italy and Germany, but retired from the army in 1545 to settle in Seville. Soon afterwards, however, he sailed for Mexico, where he resided for some time, and later returned to Mexico, where he fell victim some date previous to 1560 in Puebla to a morte galante. A follower of Juan Bosc√°n and Garcilaso de la Vega, a friend of Jer√≥nimo Jim√©nez de Urrea and Baltasar del Alc√°zar, Cetina adopted the doctrines of the Italian school and, under the name of Vandalio, wrote an extensive series of poems in the newly introduced metres; his sonnets are remarkable for elegance of form and sincerity of sentiment, his other productions being in great part adaptations from Petrarch, Ariosto and Ludovico Dolce. His patrons were Antonio de Leyva, prince of Ascoli, Hurtado de Mendoza, and Alvas's grandson, the duke de Sessa, but he seems to have profited little by their protection. His works have been well edited by Joaquin Haza√±as y la R√∫a in two volumes published at Seville (1895).

Chinigchinix was born, or first appeared, after the death of Wiyot, a tyrannical ruler of the first beings, who was poisoned by his sons. Wiyot's murder brought death into the world, and as a consequence, the male creator Night divided the first human ancestors into distinct peoples, assigning them languages and territories.Michael Eugene Harkin, Reassessing revitalization movements: perspectives from North America and the Pacific Islands, American Anthropological Association, U of Nebraska Press, 2004 , p. 15. In June 2002, 50000 Quaoar, a large Trans-Neptunian object, was discovered and named after this deity. Names The name Ouiamot is ostensibly similar to Wiyot (Ouiot), the name of another important figure, the primeval tyrant killed just before the appearance of Chinigchinix. Ouiamot is possibly to be taken as Ouiamot the childhood name of Chinigchinix. The name Quaoar was first recorded by Hugo Reid in his 1852 description of Tongva, in the spelling Qua-o-ar. Quaoar's parents were Tacu and Auzar, or, according to other accounts, he was born of Tamaayawut (Mother Earth). According to yet other accounts, \\"he had neither father nor mother\\". Both the Tongva mythology and language are recorded only fragmentarily. As a consequence, the pronunciation of the name Quaoar is not known with certainty. Hugo Reid (1852) recorded it as Qua-o-ar, suggesting that it was trisyllabic. But the Spanish transcribed it Quaguar, suggesting two syllables (, reflecting the Spanish use of gu for ). Kroeber (1925)Kroeber, Alfred. 1925. Handbook of the Indians of California, Volume 2 spells it Kwawar, though he notes Reid's spelling as well: Kwawar (\\" Qua-o-ar \\"). Harrington (1933) gives the most precise transcription, K(w)√°‚Äôuwar, in interpreting an 1846 translation of a Spanish text.Harrington, John Peabody. 1933. Chinigchinich: A Revised and Annotated Version of Alfred Robinson's Translation of Father Geronimo Boscana's Historical Account of the Belief, Usages, Customs and Extravagancies of the Indians of This Mission of San Juan Capistrano Called the Acagchemem Tribe (1846). Hanna, ed. (online) Given the general quality of Harrington's work, this might be expected to be the most accurate as well, approximately , with three syllables. In English it is , with two syllables. Mythology The Takic mythology is known only fragmentarily, as these peoples were Christianized early, by Spanish missionaries, during the late 18th to early 19th centuries. Only sparse material has been collected by ethnologists from the few remaining native speakers during 19th century. Chingichngish has variously been represented as a creator deity, a culture hero or lawgiver figure or a \\"prophet\\", who became associated with the figure of Christ after the conversion of the Takic peoples. This character was first mentioned in a description of the beliefs of the native peoples who were associated with the Mission San Juan Capistrano in accounts written by the Franciscan missionary Jer√≥nimo Boscana in the 1820s. One version of Boscana's manuscript was subsequently published by Alfred Robinson (1846), who gave it \\"Chinigchinich\\" as a title. Some subsequent scholars have characterized Luise√±o religion in general, or certain portions of it, or a set of some more widely shared traits, as a Chingichngish cult (DuBois 1908; Kroeber 1925; Moriarty 1969). John Peabody Harrington (Boscana 1933) thought that Chingichngish might have been a historical figure, but most scholars have interpreted him as a deity. Alfred L. Kroeber (1925) suggested that Chingichngish beliefs were a historic-period native response to cultural shock of the missions, and Raymond C. White (1963) thought that they might have arisen in response to earlier contacts with European sailors along the California coast. The most distinctive characteristic of Chingichngish beliefs concerned the existence of a set of \\"Chingichngish avengers\\" who spied on human beings and enforced the moral code. These figures included Raven, Rattlesnake, Bear, Mountain Lion, and others. There were also ceremonial items sacred to Chingichngish, including mortars and winnowing trays. Chingichngish beliefs were associated with the initiation ceremonies for adolescent boys, during which the hallucinogenic plant Datura (Toloache, Jimsonweed, Datura wrightii) was ingested, but elements of these ceremonies were much more widely shared than were belief in the specific character of Chingichngish.

He was most notable for his service as mayor of Sardis, Mississippi (1879-1881), a member of the Mississippi State Senate (1881-1885), member of the Mississippi Railroad Commission (1886-1890) and member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1891-1897). Early life Kyle was born in Sardis, Mississippi, the son of James M. Kyle and Susannah (Curtis) Kyle. As a boy, he attended the local schools and worked on his family's farm. He attended Bethel College through his junior year, then returned home to work on the farm. He later resumed his education at Cumberland University Law School, from which he received a LL.B. degree in 1874. He then attained admission to the bar and began a law practice in Batesville, Mississippi. After several years in Batesville, Kyle returned to Sardis, where he continued practicing law. Political career Kyle served as Democratic mayor of Sardis from 1879 to 1881, an event that was noteworthy for the fact that Kyle had not been a candidate for the office and had not campaigned for it. In 1881, Kyle was elected to the Mississippi State Senate, and he served until 1885. He declined to be a candidate for a second term, and in 1886 the state legislature chose him for a seat on the Mississippi Railroad Commission. Kyle had not sought the position, but still defeated John Marshall Stone in the legislative vote. In 1887, he was elected chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party's executive committee, and he oversaw the party's efforts in that year's statewide elections. U.S. Representative In 1890, Kyle was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was re- elected in 1892 and 1894, and served in the House from March 4, 1891 to March 3, 1897. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1896 election, declining to run because he opposed the Democratic Party's adoption of the Free silver position in its 1896 platform. Later life After leaving the House, Kyle resumed practicing law. He also became involved in several banking and business ventures. In 1900, Kyle was a candidate for the presidency of Mississippi Agricultural & Mechanical College and lost by one vote when the school's board of trustees voted 5 to 4 to offer the position to J. C. Hardy. In 1902, Kyle announced his candidacy in the 1903 gubernatorial election, but withdrew after his business and legal interests prevented him from becoming an active candidate. He retired from business in 1912, and died in Sardis on July 6, 1913, eleven days before his 62nd birthday. He was interred in Rosehill Cemetery. Family In 1879, Kyle married Sallie G. Heflin (1857-1941) of Sardis. They were the parents of a son, John Curtis Kyle Jr. (1882-1905).

Stylistically, it has certain similarities to Italian Neorealism, such as the use of location shooting and employing non-actors in secondary roles. However, the viewer is not intended to mistake a semidocumentary for a real documentary; the fictional elements are too prominent. One of the first films of this kind was The House on 92nd Street (1945): Time used the term \\"semidocumentary\\" to describe this film in 1952.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816557,00.html The producer of the film had previously worked on newsreels which inspired the film-making style. In the late 1940s, semidocumentary films were often associated with film noir thrillers, sharing a commitment to on-location shooting, gritty realism, and understated performances. Several of Richard Fleischer's films had semidocumentary qualities, as did the productions of Louis de Rochemont. In the 1960s and 1970s the semidocumentary style faded. The standard documentary had blurred the difference between itself and fiction so much that there was viewer confusion regarding what they were seeing.

By default, Flik throws red-colored berries, which are the weakest form of berry and cannot harm certain enemies. Stronger berries can either be found within a level or received from planting purple- colored seeds. Collecting purple seed tokens increases the range of berries a seed can produce. Aside from increased power, some berries travel faster and can home in on enemies. The strongest form of berry is gold-colored and is capable of permanently eliminating enemies and preventing them from respawning.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, pp. 14‚Äì15 Several seeds are scattered throughout the levels. Flik can hoist most seeds over his head and carry them to other areas, although some seeds are embedded into the ground and cannot be moved. Jumping on top of a seed creates a plant that aids Flik in some fashion. By default, all seeds are colored brown and bear plants that help Flik traverse high terrain. The color of the seeds and the type of plant they bear can be changed if Flik collects differently-colored seed tokens within a level. Some plants can restore Flik's health, provide a shield from enemy attacks, propel him through the air, or damage enemies by firing berries. Plants can be uprooted and discarded, which results in a fresh seed appearing in its place.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, pp. 11‚Äì13 Flik's health is displayed as a leaf on the top-right corner of the screen, and the player is given six lives at the beginning of the game. When Flik's health is full, the leaf appears whole, but if he is harmed by an enemy or hazard, a bite is taken out of the leaf. Health can be restored by collecting leaves marked with a red cross, which are released from defeated enemies and blue seed plants. Collecting 50 pieces of grain within a level will restore Flik's health completely. If the leaf is completely eaten away, a life is lost. An extra life can be received if the letters F, L, I and K are collected within a level. If all of Flik's lives are lost, the game ends prematurely.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, p. 18 Floating telescopes grant a rotating view of either hidden items in a level or the level's exit and the surrounding details. Flik's grain harvester is present in certain levels, and can be used to attract distant grain and permanently kill most enemies while it is worn. In some levels of the game, a harvester can be found and used to permanently defeat most small enemies as well as attract nearby grain like a magnet. Development and release Most of the film's main cast reprised their roles in the game, with the exceptions of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary, who were replaced by Jodi Benson, Andrew Stanton and Nick Jameson as Princess Atta, Hopper and Francis, respectively. Though the film was Roddy McDowall's final theatrical performance, the game was his final work overall before his death. Reception A Bug's Life was met with generally mixed to poor reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, the PlayStation version 55.73% and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version 2.7 out of 10, concluding that it was \\"obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game.\\" However, the same site later gave the Nintendo 64 version a score of 6.1 out of 10, stating that \\"Children looking to relive the fun of the movie should be pleased with the simplicity of the game.\\" IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version 6.8 out of 10, praising the presentation and sound by stating that it had an \\"Upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name\\" with \\"Cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects\\" but criticised the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with \\"stuttering framerate\\" and \\"tired gameplay mechanics\\" while they gave the PlayStation version 4 out of 10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic. The same site later gave the Game Boy Color version a score of three out of ten, calling it \\"short and repetitive\\" and \\"below average\\". Daniel Erickson reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"Any way you slice it, this stinks.\\" References External links * * A Bug‚Äôs Life (PlayStation) can be played for free in the browser on the Internet Archive Category:1998 video games Category:3D platform games Video game Category:Activision games Category:Cancelled Dreamcast games Category:Cancelled Game.com games Category:Cancelled Sega Saturn games Category:Disney video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Tiertex Design Studios games Category:THQ games Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games based on works by John Lasseter Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Single-player video games Category:Psygnosis games ","title":"A Bug's Life (video game)"},{"id":"2354759","text":"Wang Youcai Wang Youcai (, born 29 June 1966), an active dissident of the Chinese Government, was one of the supporters of democracy in China and an important student leader in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

The rod-like shape means that porridge can be stirred without congealing and forming lumps, unlike a spoon that would have a dragging effect during stirring, and the low surface area reduces the chances of porridge sticking to the instrument. Spurtles are made from wood, including beech, cherry wood, and maple. They come in a range of sizes. Traditional spurtles have stylized thistles at the top, while modern ones often have a smooth taper. The custom is that a spurtle should be used to stir in a clockwise direction with the right hand.  Etymology  Old Scots spurtell is recorded from 1528. There was a Northern English dialect word spartle, for stirrer. The modern West Germanic and North Germanic languages, as well as Middle English, also have spurtle cognates which refer to a flat- bladed tool or utensil ‚Äì so more akin to the couthie spurtle (see below) in shape. Latin spatula, as used in medicine and pharmacy, is their shared ancestor. Spatula is a diminutive of Latin spatha, a broad, flat tool or weapon, which in turn is from Ancient Greek œÉœÄŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ (\\"spathe\\"), the broad, flat tool used in weaving, or a paddle. The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language hypothesises *spe-dh- for spade and its root *spe- for a long, flat piece of wood as the ultimate source of œÉœÄŒ±Œ∏Œ∑. Our spade and our spoon are also derived from the same PIE *spe- and are therefore distant cousins of spurtle.Spade on Online Etymology Dictionary https://www.etymonline.com/word/spade, retrieved 5 May 2020  Couthie spurtle  Early spurtles were flat, wooden or metal instruments, with long handles and flat blades. The spatula-like utensils, known as 'Couthie Spurtles,' can be used for flipping oatcakes or making pancakes - but not for making porridge.

They also solve problems of automation. Systems integrators may work in many fields but the term is generally used in the information technology (IT) field such as computer networking, the defense industry, the mass media, enterprise application integration, business process management or manual computer programming. Data quality issues are an important part of the work of systems integrators.  Required skills  A system integration engineer needs a broad range of skills and is likely to be defined by a breadth of knowledge rather than a depth of knowledge. These skills are likely to include software, systems and enterprise architecture, software and hardware engineering, interface protocols, and general problem solving skills. It is likely that the problems to be solved have not been solved before except in the broadest sense. They are likely to include new and challenging problems with an input from a broad range of engineers where the system integration engineer \\"pulls it all together.\\" Performance technology integration Systems integrators generally have to be good at matching clients needs with existing products. An inductive reasoning aptitude is useful for quickly understanding how to operate a system or a GUI. A systems integrator will tend to benefit from being a generalist, knowing a lot about a large number of products. Systems integration includes a substantial amount of diagnostic and troubleshooting work. The ability to research existing products and software components is also helpful. Creation of these information systems may include designing or building customized prototypes or concepts. In the defense industry In the defense industry, the job of 'Systems Integration' engineer is growing in importance as defense systems become more 'connected'. As well as integrating new systems, the task of integrating current systems is attracting a lot of research and effort. It is only in recent years that systems have started to be deployed that can interconnect with each other; most systems were designed as 'stovepipe' designs with no thought to future connectivity. The current problem is how to harness all the information available, from the various information generators (or sensors) into one complete picture. As well as the design of the actual interfaces much effort is being put into presenting the information in a useful manner. The level of information, needed by the different levels in the military structure, and the relevance of the information (information can become outdated in seconds) is so variable that it may be necessary to have more than one system connected. Another problem is how information is networked. The Internet may seem to be an obvious solution, but it is vulnerable to denial of service and physical destruction of the key 'hubs'. One answer is to use a dedicated military communication system, but the bandwidth needed would be astronomical in such a system. Army Warrant Officer (United States) military occupational specialty (MOS) 140A - Command and Control Systems Technician is an example of a systems integrator in the defense industry. 140A Warrant Officers assigned to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) integrate systems with multiple operating systems (OS) and hardware configurations ‚Äì that include: UNIX, Linux & Microsoft Windows Others can fill a similar role at the Division level and higher. In Entertainment and architectural controls In entertainment and architectural installations, systems integrators function as a designer/engineer, bringing together a wide array of components from various manufacturers to accomplish the goal of creating a unified, functioning system that meets the needs of the client. Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various OEMs to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects. The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed. Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design. As lighting and A/V systems increase in their level of sophistication, and the number of manufacturers for components of these systems increases, so does the demand for systems integrators. Common data protocols involved in entertainment and architectural systems are Digital Multiplexing (or DMX512-A), Remote Device Management (or RDM), Art-Net, ACN or sACN (Streaming Architecture for Control Networks), Analog, and various proprietary control software from a variety of manufacturers. Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations. The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access. The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles). This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes. For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server. The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality. A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.  In the automation industry  System Integrators in the automation industry typically provide the product and application experience in implementing complex automation solutions. Often, System Integrators are aligned with automation vendors, joining their various System Integrator programs for access to development products, resources and technical support. System integrators are tightly linked to their accounts and often are viewed as the engineering departments for small manufacturers, handling their automation system installation, commissioning, long term maintenance and security.

His most notable artwork is the Winged Victory that crowns the Independence Column in downtown Mexico City.  Career  He began his career in Marseille as a sculptor following the French school. In 1886, he received an honorable mention for his works in the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, where he exhibited regularly until 1913. In all his works Alciati adhered to the classical tradition, while the influence of Rodin is also quite prominent. It is thought he moved to Mexico City in 1889, where he quickly won critical acclaim for his marble and bronze busts of Mexican personalities. In 1891 he was commissioned by the Mexican government to create statues of national heroes for Paseo de la Reforma, in Mexico City. Of special mention is the statue of Colonel Miguel L√≥pez, for which Alciati won prizes at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the 1895 World's Fair in Atlanta. Alciati was appointed professor of sculpture, decoration and modelling at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1895. At the beginning of the 20th century he was commissioned by then President Porfirio D√≠az to create most of the sculptures for the Independence Column in Mexico City under the direction of Antonio Rivas Mercado. While he made the marbles in Mexico and Florence, he cast the bronzes exclusively in the Italian city. Sculptures Most of his late works are spread over the Mexico City downtown area, some of these include: *Various busts of prominent Mexicans along Paseo de la Reforma. *A bust of Josefa Ort√≠z de Dom√≠nguez located in Santo Domingo Square, northwest of the Metropolitan Cathedral. *Sculptures that decorate the Postal Palace, across the street from Bellas Artes. *A statue of Benito Ju√°rez given as a gift to the United States government and now located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, DC, near the Department of State.

His sister was the writer and feminist Sophia Dobson Collet (1822‚Äì1894). His brother was the engineer Edward Dobson (1816‚Äì1908). After abandoning a career in the law due to lack of money, Collet became director of music at South Place Chapel and was heavily involved in the Chartist movement. He became Secretary of the People's Charter Union, and of the Newspaper Stamp Abolition Committee (i.e. to overturn the Stamp Act) in 1849. From 1851 - 1870 he was Secretary of the Association for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge. In 1866 he became editor of The Diplomatic Review. This had been known as The Free Press prior to Collet taking it over and was a mouthpiece for the views of David Urquhart. Collet invited radicals to contribute to the Diplomatic Review and as a result began publishing articles by Karl Marx. The two became great friends and weekly meetings were held at each other's houses at which Shakespeare readings were given by members of their families. These meetings became formalised as the Dogberry Club. Marx's daughter Eleanor and Collet's daughter, Clara Collet, amongst others, became heavily involved in the readings. His five children included the colonial administrator Wilfred Collet (1856‚Äì1929) and the educationalist Clara Collet (1860‚Äì1948).

By that point living in the Westland estate, a loyalist enclave in north Belfast close to the republican Ardoyne and Newington areas, he was sworn in as a UDA member at a ceremony in the Westland community centre at which he had to swear allegiance to the movement on a Bible in the presence of a UDA colonel.Colin Crawford, Inside the UDA ‚Äì Volunteers and Violence, Pluto Ireland, 2003, p. 58 Known as a \\"court jester\\" by his associates,Taylor, Peter (1999): Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.84 he never took much of an active military role in the UDA, although he was considered \\"handy with his fists\\". On one occasion during the Ulster Workers' Council Strike in May 1974, he physically barred Reverend Ian Paisley from entering the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party headquarters where an important meeting was being held by the Ulster Workers' Council Co- Ordinating Committee and chaired by Glenn Barr.Taylor, pp.134‚Äì135 In the course of the general strike, which effectively brought Northern Ireland to a standstill, he was among those who manned the many street barricades that were set up. On the first full day of the strike he had assisted in the hijacking of a bakery van. Duddy and the others, however, paid the driver for the loaves of bread he was in the process of delivering.Wood, p.41 Duddy, who was known as a literate and well-spoken individual from his involvement in the Westland housing association, was in the early 1970s employed by then UDA leader Andy Tyrie to work as part of his staff at the UDA headquarters at 254A Shankill Road.Crawford, Inside the UDA, pp. 60‚Äì61 He rose to prominence within the organisation in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he served as the UDA's public relations officer along with Hester Dunn. At that time the UDA was legal, and would remain so until 1992. Duddy went on to serve as the editor of UDA magazine Ulster for a time and in 1983 published a book of his poetry entitled Concrete Whirlpools of the Mind which received praise for its sensitive treatment of the problems for young working class men drawn into violence. To avoid any possible implication in the Kincora Boys' Home scandal, Duddy ended the drag act in 1981 under orders from Tyrie, who also told him to grow a moustache and drop his voice. He was briefly a suspect in the UDA killing of Catholic lawyer, Pat Finucane in 1989; UDA brigadier Ken Barrett was later convicted of the shooting. From 1989 to 1990, he spent 11 months in jail on remand following his arrest during the John Stevens inquiry into collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army. He was charged with possession of classified security force documents which had been passed to the UDA and contained the names of republicans which the UDA used to target Provisional IRA members. The charges against him were dropped in October 1990 and he was released. Duddy retired from active loyalism in the 1990s, but was recalled by the UPRG to help rebuild their image after the collapse of the Ulster Democratic Party and the split from Johnny Adair and John White. He was the North Belfast representative for the UPRG. At the height of the fall-out in 2002, his home in Rathcoole, north Belfast, was hit with a pipe bomb. That same year, shots were fired through his front door by masked gunmen; although he was unharmed, his seven-year-old pet chihuahua dog \\"Bambi\\" died within an hour after being hit by gunfire. Another dog, \\"Pepsi\\" was injured in the attack but survived. According to Johnny Adair, Duddy never got over the loss of \\"Bambi\\".\\"At home with Johnny Adair\\". Sunday Tribune.

This rule is known as the Bolam test, and states that if a doctor reaches the standard of a responsible body of medical opinion, they are not negligent. Bolam was rejected in the 2015 Supreme Court decision of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board.[2015] UKSC 11 Facts Mr Bolam was a voluntary patient at Friern Hospital, a mental health institution run by the Friern Hospital Management Committee. He agreed to undergo electro- convulsive therapy. He was not given any muscle relaxant, and his body was not restrained during the procedure. He flailed about violently before the procedure was stopped, and he suffered some serious injuries, including fractures of the acetabula. He sued the committee for compensation. He argued they were negligent for: # not issuing relaxants # not restraining him # not warning him about the risks involved. At this time, juries were still being used for tort cases in England and Wales, so the judge's role would be to sum up the law and then leave it for the jury to hold the defendant liable or not. Judgment McNair J at the first instance noted that expert witnesses had confirmed, much medical opinion was opposed to the use of relaxant drugs, and that manual restraints could sometimes increase the risk of fracture. Moreover, it was the common practice of the profession to not warn patients of the risk of treatment (when it is small) unless they are asked. He held that what was common practice in a particular profession was highly relevant to the standard of care required. A person falls below the appropriate standard, and is negligent, if he fails to do what a reasonable person would in the circumstances. But when a person professes to have professional skills, as doctors do, the standard of care must be higher. \\"It is just a question of expression\\", said McNair J. > \\"I myself would prefer to put it this way, that he is not guilty of > negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper > by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art. I do > not think there is much difference in sense. It is just a different way of > expressing the same thought. Putting it the other way round, a man is not > negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely > because there is a body of opinion who would take a contrary view. At the > same time, that does not mean that a medical man can obstinately and pig- > headedly carry on with some old technique if it has been proved to be > contrary to what is really substantially the whole of informed medical > opinion. Otherwise you might get men today saying: ‚ÄúI do not believe in > anaesthetics. I do not believe in antiseptics. I am going to continue to do > my surgery in the way it was done in the eighteenth century.‚Äù That clearly > would be wrong.\\"[1957] 1 W.L.R. 582, 587 In this case, the jury delivered a verdict in favour of the defendant hospital. Given the general medical opinions about what was acceptable electro-shock practice, they had not been negligent in the way they carried out the treatment. That passage is quoted very frequently, and has served as the basic rule for professional negligence over the last fifty years. Significance Bolam was re-examined and revised in the 2015 Supreme Court decision of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board.[2015] UKSC 11 The law distinguishes between liability flowing from acts and omissions, and liability flowing from misstatements. The Bolam principle addresses the first element and may be formulated as a rule that a doctor, nurse or other health professional is not negligent if he or she acts in accordance with a practice accepted at the time as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion, even though some other practitioners adopt a different practice. In addition, Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd. v Heller & Partners Ltd. [1964] AC 465 created the rule of \\"reasonable reliance\\" by the claimant on the professional judgment of the defendant. > \\"Where a person is so placed that others could reasonably rely upon his > judgment or his skill or upon his ability to make careful inquiry, and a > person takes it upon himself to give information or advice to, or allows his > information or advice to be passed on to, another person who, as he knows or > should know, will place reliance upon it, then a duty of care will > arise.\\"[1964] AC 465, at ??? Because of the nature of the relationship between a medical practitioner and a patient, it is reasonable for the patient to rely on the advice given by the practitioner. Thus, Bolam applies to all the acts and omissions constituting diagnosis and consequential treatment, and Hedley Byrne applies to all advisory activities involving the communication of diagnosis and prognosis, giving of advice on both therapeutic and non-therapeutic options for treatment, and disclosure of relevant information to obtain informed consent. *Barnett v Chelsea & Kensington Hospital [1968] 1 All ER 1068. Three men attended at the emergency department but the casualty officer, who was himself unwell, did not see them, advising that they should go home and call their own doctors. One of the men died some hours later. The post mortem showed arsenical poisoning which was a rare cause of death. Even if the deceased had been examined and admitted for treatment, there was little or no chance that the only effective antidote would have been administered to him in time. Although the hospital had been negligent in failing to examine the men, there was no proof that the deceased's death was caused by that negligence. *Whitehouse v Jordan [1981] 1 All ER 267: The claimant was a baby who suffered severe brain damage after a difficult birth. The defendant, a senior hospital registrar, was supervising delivery in a high-risk pregnancy. After the mother had been in labour for 22 hours, the defendant used forceps to assist the delivery. The Lords found that the doctor's standard of care did not fall below that of a reasonable doctor in the circumstances and so the baby was awarded no compensation. *Sidaway v Bethlem Royal Hospital Governors [1985] AC 871: The claimant suffered from pain in her neck, right shoulder, and arms. Her neurosurgeon took her consent for cervical cord decompression, but did not include in his explanation the fact that in less than 1% of the cases, the said decompression caused paraplegia. She developed paraplegia after the spinal operation. Rejecting her claim for damages, the court held that consent did not require an elaborate explanation of remote side effects. In dissent, Lord Scarman said that the Bolam principle should not apply to the issue of informed consent and that a doctor should have a duty to tell the patient of the inherent and material risk of the treatment proposed. *Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health Authority [1985] 1 All ER 635. The patient presented with symptoms of tuberculosis but both the consultant physician and the consultant surgeon took the view that Hodgkin's disease, carcinoma, and sarcoidosis were also possibilities, the first of which if present would have required remedial steps to be taken in its early stages. Instead of waiting for the results of the sputum tests, the consultants carried out a mediastinoscopy to get a biopsy. The inherent risk of damage was to the left laryngeal recurrent nerve, even if the operation was properly done. In the event, only tuberculosis was confirmed. Unfortunately, the risk became a reality and the patient suffered a paralysis of the left vocal cord. The decision of the physician and the surgeon to proceed was said by their expert peers to be reasonable in all the circumstances. *Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority [1987] 2 All ER 909. The extent of the hip injuries to a 13-year-old boy was not diagnosed for five days. By the age of 20 years, there was deformity of the hip joint, restricted mobility and permanent disability. The judge found that even if the diagnosis had been made correctly, there was still a 75% risk of the plaintiff's disability developing, but that the medical staff's breach of duty had turned that risk into an inevitability, thereby denying the plaintiff a 25% chance of a good recovery. Damages included an amount of ¬£11,500 representing 25% of the full value of the damages awardable for the plaintiff's disability. On appeal to the Lords, the question was whether the cause of the injury was the fall or the health authority's negligence in delaying treatment, since if the fall had caused the injury the negligence of the authority was irrelevant in regard to the plaintiff's disability. Because the judge had held that on the balance of probabilities, even correct diagnosis and treatment would not have prevented the disability from occurring, it followed that the plaintiff had failed on the issue of causation. It was therefore irrelevant to consider the question of damages. *Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1988] AC 1074 The defendant hospital, initially acting through an inexperienced junior doctor, negligently administered excessive oxygen during the post-natal care of a premature child who subsequently became blind. Excessive oxygen was, according to the medical evidence, one of five possible factors that could have led to blindness and, therefore, the Lords found that it was impossible to say that it had caused, or materially contributed, to the injury and the claim was dismissed. In a minority view, Mustill LJ. argued that if it is established that conduct of a certain kind materially adds to the risk of injury, if the defendant engages in such conduct in breach of a common law duty, and if the injury is the kind to which the conduct related, then the defendant is taken to have caused the injury even though the existence and extent of the contribution made by the breach cannot be ascertained. *Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority [1997] 4 All ER 771: A two-year-old boy suffered brain damage as a result of the bronchial air passages becoming blocked leading to cardiac arrest. It was agreed that the only course of action to prevent the damage was to have the boy intubated. The doctor who negligently failed to attend to the boy said that she would not have intubated had she attended. There was evidence from one expert witness that he would not have intubated whereas five other experts said that they would have done so. The House of Lords held that there would have to be a logical basis for the opinion not to intubate. This would involve a weighing of risks against benefit in order to achieve a defensible conclusion. This means that a judge will be entitled to choose between two bodies of expert opinion and to reject an opinion which is 'logically indefensible'. This has been interpreted as being a situation where the Court sets the law not the profession. *Albrighton v RPA Hospital,Albrighton v RPA Hospital (1980) 2 NSWLR 542. Supreme Court (NSW, Australia). where a patient in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital who had been born with a spinal problem had her spinal cord totally severed leaving her a paraplegic. Reynolds JA rejected the proposition that doctors could not be negligent if they acted in accordance with the usual and customary practice and procedure in their ‚Äúmedical community‚Äù, holding that \\"it is not the law that, if all or most of the medical practitioners in Sydney habitually fail to take an available precaution to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to their patients, then none can be found guilty of negligence\\".Albrighton v Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [1980] 2 NSWLR 542 at pp 562-3 (29 September 1980) NSW Court of Appeal. *F v R,F v R (1983) 33 SASR 189 Full Court Supreme Court (SA, Australia). Where Chief Justice King said, \\"In many cases an approved professional practice as to disclosure will be decisive. But professions may adopt unreasonable practices. Practices may develop in professions, particularly as to disclosure, not because they serve the interests of the clients, but because they protect the interests or convenience of members of the profession. The court has an obligation to scrutinize professional practices to ensure that they accord with the standard of reasonableness imposed by the law. A practice as to disclosure approved and adopted by a profession or section of it may be in many cases the determining consideration as to what is reasonable. On the facts of a particular case the answer to the question whether the defendant‚Äôs conduct conformed to approved professional practice may decide the issue of negligence, and the test has been posed in such terms in a number of cases. The ultimate question, however, is not whether the defendant‚Äôs conduct accords with the practices of his profession or some part of it, but whether it conforms to the standard of reasonable care demanded by the law. That is a question for the court and the duty of deciding it cannot be delegated to any profession or group in the community.\\" =Misfeasance= Where it can be shown that the decision-maker was not merely negligent, but acted with \\"malice\\", the tort of \\"misfeasance in public office\\" may give rise to a remedy. An example might be a prison doctor refusing to treat a prisoner because he or she had previously been difficult or abusive. Although proof of spite or ill-will may make a decision-maker's act unlawful, actual malice in the sense of an act intended to do harm to a particular individual, is not necessary. It will be enough that the decision-maker knew that he or she was acting unlawfully and that this would cause injury to some person, or was recklessly indifferent to that result. *Palmer v Tees Health Authority [1998] All ER 180; (1999) Lloyd‚Äôs Medical Reports 151 (CA) A psychiatric out-patient, who was known to be dangerous, murdered a four-year- old child. The claim was that the defendant had failed to diagnose that there was a real, substantial, and foreseeable risk of the patient committing serious sexual offences against children and that, as a result, it had failed to provide any adequate treatment for him to reduce the risk of him committing such offences and/or to prevent him from being released from the hospital while he was at risk of committing such offences. But the court struck out the claim on the grounds that there was no duty of care towards the child, as any child, at any time, was in the same danger. Furthermore, as the patient did not suffer from a treatable mental illness, there was no legal right to either treat or detain the person. *Akenzua v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 1470, (2003) 1 WLR 741 where a dangerous criminal due to be deported, was released by the police/immigration services to act as an informant and killed a member of the public. The Lords held that if a public officer knows that his or her acts and omissions will probably injure a person or class of persons, the public body (or the state) will be liable for the consequences. In this case, it was arguable that there had been an illegal use of the power to permit the deportee to remain at liberty and that the officials exercising that power must have known that it was illegal. Given the criminal's record, the officials must at least have been reckless as to the consequences. For these purposes, it was not necessary to prove foresight that a particular individual might be at risk: it was enough that it was foreseeable that the criminal would harm somebody. Palmer was distinguishable because the relevant officials had the power to detain and deport the dangerous person.

In the UK it was published as At the Edge of the West. Plot introduction The narrator is the botanist Mendoza. What we are reading is apparently her confession of why she deserted her post and ran away with a mortal, and then violently killed the six others responsible for his death. Plot summary As the novel opens, Mendoza is walking through incessant rain in the hills above old Los Angeles. It is winter, 1862, and to the east America is at war with itself. For over 150 years she has lived wild in the Pacific coast forest, collecting and cataloging plant species, and rarely interacting with anybody else, human or cyborg. This suits her fine, and she resents being commanded down to Cahuenga Pass for a special mission. As usual, however, she wants to be a \\"good little machine\\". She already knows what the mission is. The rain will be followed by a long drought, and there will be much to be preserved, which would otherwise be lost. What the drought cannot eradicate, starving cattle will. Meanwhile, smallpox will reduce the local population, especially the Native Americans. Arriving at the Inn at the pass, she quickly meets her fellow cyborgs, the Facilitator Porfirio, Anthropologist Oscar, Zoologist Einar, Ornithologist Juan Bautista, and the Anthropologist Imarte, with whom she renews her ongoing feud. With all the traffic passing by, the Inn is a perfect cover for Company research and other work. However, when Mendoza arrives, the main problem is lighting a fire to cook dinner, given that everything is soaked by the rain. Mendoza's first night is a rough one, as she dreams incessantly of Nicholas Harpole, her lover in 16th century England, who was burned at the stake. She is woken by Porfirio, who tells her she has been blasting the place with \\"Crome radiation\\", the blue radiance of psychic activity. She dismisses his concerns, but worries about this sudden resurgence of her previous troubles. Later, she is led into the hills by Einar, to collect samples in the \\"Temperate Belt\\" which will be severely affected by the drought. This just happens to follow the future path of Sunset Boulevard. Along the way, Einar has to kill one of the locals. The hills are infested with bandits, crazy pioneers and other mortals likely to shoot first and warn later. Mendoza is shocked - cyborgs are programmed to run from danger and not harm mortals. Einar informs her that the rules are different here. She is even given a Navy pistol to use if necessary. The Inn's inhabitants pass the time with movies supplied by the Company. In one chapter, we get a long and reverent description of them watching D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, with Einar as Chorus describing every scene. Since Imarte was actually alive in Babylon, one of the movie's famous settings, we hear much about what life was really like. Everything is thrown into tumult, however, when Mendoza decides to forage in Laurel Canyon. The place is known to be saturated with Crome radiation from a bizarre underground quartz formation. It is this which will attract so many unusual people to the site in the 20th century, and give rise to many of the underground stories of Hollywood. Despite precautions and a lot of very futuristic equipment, Mendoza and Einar suddenly find themselves thrown forward in time to 1996. Mendoza the botanist is suddenly in urban LA, where the soil is concrete and the major life form is the automobile. Staggering up to a Company safe house whose future location they know, they are hastily taken inside by the staff, who have been expecting this event. Horses and all, they are placed in a Time Transfer chamber for return to their own time, but at the last minute Mendoza sees the cyborg Lewis enter the building. Lewis had befriended Mendoza at the facility New World One and she suspected he was in love with her. Lewis makes an attempt to talk to Mendoza, and tries to warn her \\"Don't go with him!\\". She has no idea what he means, and in any case, the transfer takes place before any more can be said. Returning to the Inn, short one horse which died from the Transfer, Mendoza confronts Porfirio. He must have known what was going to happen to her. He grudgingly admits he knew something, but was just told to let it happen. He also knew only what he needed to know, and nothing more. The drought starts to bite, and Mendoza is going further and further around the bend. Her lover haunts her dreams every night, and the resulting Crome's radiation provides nocturnal fireworks for her colleagues. She can no longer do any real work. Then one of Imarte's clients leaves behind a briefcase with amazing documents in it. They seem to relate to a British plot to exploit the disarray in the United States and take over the Channel Islands, specifically Santa Catalina. From there, a few well-armed ships could control the seas of Western North America. Imarte records all the papers and heads for San Francisco to do more research. All the others are called away also, except for Mendoza and Juan Bautista, who has finally allowed his pets to be shipped out with all the other biological samples. At this point, Mendoza is astonished by the arrival of her ex-lover, Nicholas Harpole, except that he does not recognize her and goes by the name of Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax, an Englishman with mysterious intentions. Mistaking her for Imarte's assistant, he requests the usual service. Mendoza eagerly complies. Soon Edward reveals he has come for the briefcase. However he is also intrigued by Mendoza, who shows sexual sophistication despite being virgo intacta - apparently the healing capability of the cyborg physiology has gone to extremes in her. She is able to persuade him to take her away, as she will enable him to avoid U.S. agents hot on his trail as he goes to meet his fellow conspirators. Once more Mendoza embarks on an idyll, as they trek to San Pedro, and then to Santa Catalina, where a mysterious sailing ship awaits. Edward starts to show unexpected abilities, especially in being aware of things that humans usually cannot perceive. But then the ship turns out to be a trap, set by the Pinkertons. Edward is killed while disposing of the incriminating documents, and Mendoza finally snaps. She goes into overdrive, killing all the agents. When the British finally show up, she throws assorted body parts at them, whereupon they flee. In the rest of the story Mendoza, having completed her confession, awaits her punishment. In the meantime, she examines her considerable store of information about the history of old LA, noticing for the first time how Santa Catalina has some kind of significance in the activities of the Company. Apparently something on the island is vital to the actual creation of the Company, but what? Before she can pursue this further, she is put in a Time Transfer box and sent Back Way Back, or in more usual terms, to about 150,000 BCE. She is left on Santa Catalina itself, still forested rather than the barren island of later millennia. Her job is to raise food for a Company resort on Santa Cruz Island, where rich folks come back to hobnob with mastodons and hunt saber-tooths, or maybe vice versa. Her memory has been interfered with, so she can no longer remember details of the history she once knew. She also has a mission to alert the Company when certain unusual beings show up to colonize the center of the island. Apparently they have something the Company needs.... Mendoza seems hopelessly trapped. Can she survive to the 19th century all over again, or is her immortality as suspect as other things have become? Twice now she has met her demon lover. She knows he will come for her again. Characters * Anthropologist Imarte is doing her research the old-fashioned way, by playing the part of \\"lady of easy virtue\\" and recording the things her customers tell her. * Einar is obsessed by Hollywood, since he is also a Film Preservation Specialist, a role he expects to play when the region is urbanized. For him, every patch of scrub is the site of some notable future place, event, or scene in a movie. Meanwhile, he collects examples of California Brown Bear, and the local coyote subspecies, both of which are shortly to be extinct. * Juan Bautista, who happens to have been born one of the last remaining Channel Island Indians, with the silver hair that comes with the ancestry, insists on keeping a pet condor and pelican inside rather than in the outhouses. The others are not happy with the noise and smell. As movie-obsessed as any cyborg, Juan Bautista names the condor Erich von Stroheim, after the future movie director, and the pelican Marie Dressler, after a future academy-award winning actress born in the second half of the 19th century. Unfortunately \\"Erich\\" cannot bear to be parted from Juan Bautista, and makes everyone's life unbearable whenever this happens. Later Juan Bautista confiscates an eagle from a passing stagecoach, and names the bird John Barrymore. * Anthropologist Oscar plays the role of go-getting salesman to the hilt. He is having trouble unloading some of his more expensive items, such as the brass-bound Yankee pie cupboard. With no Yankees to speak of in the area, pies are not a common menu item. However his real purpose is to gain entry to people's houses so he can record their lives. Still, it would be quite a coup to unload that cupboard. * Porfirio presides over all this while keeping watch on his \\"family,\\" or at least his brother's descendants. Both he and his brother were orphaned, but only Porfirio was suitable for conversion to cyborg, so the Company placed the brother with foster parents. Porfirio has been carrying out his mother's last wish to look after his baby brother. For 300 years. Allusions and references to history, geography and current science Many real places and people feature in this novel. The action takes place in Cahuenga Pass, by modern Hollywood, old Los Angeles, San Pedro, and the island of Santa Catalina. The time is the 1860s, concurrent with the American Civil War. References are made to personalities such as Phineas Banning and his stagecoach company. When thrown forward in time, Mendoza and Einar, along with their horses, find themselves alongside a busy 20th century highway. This appears to be Laurel Canyon Boulevard. They then proceed up a ridge to houses, first on Vulcan Drive, then along Mt. Olympus Drive to Zeus Drive, where the Company has a facility. These are all real locations. Reception F&SF; reviewer Charles de Lint gave the novel a mixed review. \\"There are all sorts of interesting things going on in it. But the book is slow going since it takes about two thirds of the way through before much of a plot kicks in. . . .

Among the original employees, known as \\"Ashley's Hundred,\\" were Jedediah Smith, who went on to take a leading role in the company's operations, and Jim Bridger, who was among those who bought out Smith and his partners in 1830. It was Bridger and his partners who gave the enterprise the name \\"Rocky Mountain Fur Company.\\" The company became a pioneer in western exploration, most notably in the Green River Valley. The operations of other aspiring organizations like the American Fur Company would often overlap, causing a fierce rivalry. Growing competition motivated the trappers to explore and head deeper into the wilderness. This led to greater knowledge of the topography and to great reductions in the beaver populations. Eventually the intense competition for fewer and fewer beavers and the transient style of fur hats brought the Rocky Mountain Fur Company down. Nearly a decade after its founding, the stock holders sold all their shares, leaving behind a legacy in terms of both western settlement and folklore. The US government, seeking geographic knowledge or travel advice regarding the West, would seek out former members of the company as consultants. Ashley himself later became a congressman whose expertise was Western affairs.  Founding  In the early 1820s General William Ashley, of the Missouri militia, was looking to enter state politics but needed to raise funds to do so. Having barely survived a slew of past entrepreneurial and military pursuits, Ashley was looking at an insolvent future. To counteract his previous financial failures, he looked west to the fur trade. Joining him as a partner was Major Andrew Henry, a long-time friend of Ashley's. Canvasing the local St. Louis area in 1822, they published an ad in the St. Louis Enquirer Advertisement.\\" St. Louis Enquirer (St. Louis, Missouri) III, no. 296, March 23, 1822: [4]. Readex: America's Historical Newspapers. It targeted \\"One Hundred enterprising young men . . . to ascend the river Missouri to its source, there to be employed for one, two, or three years.\\" The caliber of men sought by Ashley and Henry would serve as the prototypical \\"mountain man\\". The criteria for the position was simple enough ‚Äì masculine, well-armed, and able to work (trap) for up to three years. The ad attracted ample attention; roughly 150 men signed up. Among those hired were Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.http://hughglass.org/mountain-man/ Later, the four oldest Sublette brothers, including William and Milton, Jim Beckwourth, Hugh Glass, Thomas Fitzpatrick, David Edward Jackson, Joseph Meek, Robert Newell, George W. Egbert, joined the company. Smith, Jackson and William Sublette bought the Company in 1826, and sold out to Bridger, Milton Sublette, Fitzpatrick and two others in 1830, at which time the enterprise was given the name by which it is most commonly referred to. The payment method was uniquely designed by Ashley. Leveraging employment costs, Ashley and Henry had their trappers keep half of their proceeds and forfeit the other half to management. In turn, Ashley and Henry would provide many of the materials needed to trap.  Operation  In the early days, Ashley's Hundred worked the lands around the upper Missouri River. As the company considered building outposts along the river, Ashley soon discovered that the Missouri Fur Company had already done so. Eventually Ashley and his company moved farther west to the mountain range for which it was named. Forging new paths and discovering landscapes unknown to whites, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company ultimately pioneered a new style in the fur trade. Known as the brigade-rendezvous system, Major Henry's system was formed in part as a reaction to a July 1822 law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Indians. Prior to this point, the fur trade had relied on Indians to do the actual trapping and hunting that produced the furs; they were then brought to trading posts where, with increasing frequency, the Indians were given liquor both as an actual medium of exchange, and in order to render them pliant and easily cheated. The pattern was so firmly established that it was difficult to conduct business without a substantial supply of alcohol. Henry's plan made Indian trappers and trading posts unnecessary; he trained young white and met√≠s men to trap and had them meet him at rendezvous, which were temporary trade gatherings that could be located wherever it was convenient. Ashley and his men had mixed success. By the middle of the decade, the company had a firm grasp of the Rockies. Headquartered in the Green River Valley, trappers found numerous spots to collect valuable pelts. Some of these locations included: Horse Creek, La Barge Creek, Fontenolle Creek, and Black Fork. Two popular trading destinations were Pierre's Hole in Idaho and Fort Bonneville (also called Fort Nonsense) in Wyoming. In some cases, however, the company took heavy losses. Losing supplies and even men, some expeditions ended in catastrophe. On two separate occasions, trappers were killed by Blackfeet and Arikara Indians. Another blow was when Major Andrew Henry, considered the most experienced trapper, left the company in 1824. Two years later Ashley followed suit to embark on a political career. In 1826 he sold his company off to a group of his employees. Nonetheless, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company continued for eight more years. None of these setbacks spelled the end for Ashley's Hundred, but soon the company confronted the same set of problems that faced the entire industry.  Decline and demise  Like all fur companies at the time, Ashley's Hundred went out of business in face of deepening financial woes. Competition, which bred bitter rivalries, helped to price the Rocky Mountain Fur Company out of the market. Declining beaver populations and shifting fashions did the rest of the damage. Rocky Mountain trappers encroached on competitors' territory, resulting in bitter turf wars. The Rocky Mountain Fur Company was a rival to Hudson's Bay Company and John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. They frequently held their rendezvous near a Hudson's Bay Company post to draw off some of their Indian trade, and their trappers went into the Snake, Umpqua and Rogue River valleys, all of which were considered the domain of the Hudson's Bay Company. By 1832, the competition was at its height. So too was the growing Native American resentment, which resulted in several skirmishes. Moreover, unbridled competition dwindled the available fur supply. A once healthy population of beaver, otter, bear, and muskrat disappeared; the companies found it harder and harder to trap. This only led to greater struggle for the zones with abundant game. The larger American and Hudson's Bay companies also had an advantage over the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. With access to a wider land base, these two companies undersold their smaller competitor. Even more catastrophic was the fading popularity of the fur hat. Once a staple of European and American fashion, fur hats fell out of fashion in the 1830s, replaced by newly popular silk hats. By 1834, the company was in trouble. Facing insolvency, the partners decided to sell off their assets. A once bitter rival, the American Fur Company, quickly absorbed Ashley's creation.  Trapping a legacy  Few knew the Rocky Mountains better than Ashley's Hundred. Among Euro-Americans, they had the greatest knowledge of a vast and treacherous terrain and shared this knowledge with both government and private parties. William Ashley eventually did get his wish for political power, representing Missouri in Congress from 1831-1836. He quickly positioned himself as an expert in western affairs, thanks to his time spent with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Other company men, such as Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger, continued to trap beyond the Rocky Mountains and acted as guides and map makers for subsequent settlers. Not only were maps influenced by this small company, but so too was the heritage of the fur trapping era. The company developed the legendary brigade-rendezvous system and helped popularize the mountain man as an iconic figure of the Rocky Mountain West .

Origin The question derives from a theme repeated by characters in Horatio Alger, Jr.'s novel Five Hundred Dollars; or, Jacob Marlowe's Secret, which was first published in 1890. Alger was a best-selling author in the 19th century, especially among young people, and his books were widely quoted. In the book, a group of actors play in Peoria, occasioning utterances such as \\"We shall be playing in Peoria\\" and \\"We shall play at Peoria\\" (p. 218, etc.). Appropriated as symbolic of reception by mainstream America, these declarations were alluded to in paraphrase, eventually resulting in the question, Will it play in Peoria? with the particular intent it now carries. Peoria as a metaphor Peoria's Madison Theatre, which hosted both vaudeville and film in the early 20th century Peoria, Illinois has developed an unusual reputation over the decades, such that a kind of folklore has grown around the name. The famous catch-phrase about \\"playing in Peoria\\" has origins in vaudeville or burlesque. Don Marine, professor of theatre at Illinois Central College (East Peoria), commented: > If one were to choose the city in the United States most victimized in jokes > and anecdotes by theatrical personalities, the selection of Peoria, > Illinois, would be a popular, if not likely choice. Two of the more popular > quips are: \\"Say, I hear you got married. How did that ever happen?\\" \\"I was > playing a split-bill in Peoria‚Äîand it rained!\\" and \\"Have you ever played > Peoria?\\" \\"Peoria? Oh, yes‚ÄîI spent four years there one night!\\" The > widespread appeal of this verbal maligning by comics, actors and other > performers suggests Peoria as a paramount example of the dull, banal, and > provincial theatrical road stop. But the popularity of the \\"put down\\" > suggests as well that the city possesses a theatrical heritage of > considerable longevity.Scheetz, George H. \\"Peoria.\\" In Place Names in the > Midwestern United States. Edited by Edward Callary. (Studies in Onomastices; > 1.) Mellen Press, 2000. Marine judged Peoria the way Peorians in the late 20th century usually seemed to judge themselves‚Äîthat is, dull, banal, and provincial. Historically, however, whiskey, gambling, and prostitution gave the city a reputation as being \\"wide open\\". Only since the 1950s was the lid put on Peoria; but the reputation, and thus the gibes, has existed since vaudeville. A 1945 comment in American Notes and Queries offers a different point of view: > Peoria (Ill.) has been an old stand-by with comedians for years‚Äîbut not only > because of the \\"O\\" sound. Nor because of the four vowel sounds that give it > a nice noisy resonance. But largely, I suspect, because of the fact that it > is a whiskey town and a river town and not particularly famous for what is > known as the genteel tradition. The phrase originated during the vaudeville era and was popularized in movies by Groucho Marx.Marx asks the question in A Night at the Opera The belief was that if a new show was successful in Peoria, a main Midwestern stop for vaudeville acts, it would be successful anywhere. Old booklet: How to Enter Vaudeville Jack Mabley, writing in the Chicago Tribune, concluded that \\"if it plays in Peoria it has good taste,\\" but a more apt meaning is, according to James C. Ballowe, former dean of Peoria's Bradley University graduate school, that \\"Peoria is a tough audience.\\" In other words, \\"it bombed in Peoria\\" or \\"it was great in Peoria\\" had recognizable meaning from one coast to the other. The phrase subsequently was adopted by politicians, pollsters, and promoters to question the potential mainstream acceptance of anything new. Currently, the stereotype of non-humorous people has been around for many decades. Although vaudeville left Peoria many years ago, the slogan was revived in 1969 when John D. Ehrlichman said to a newsman, \\"Don't worry, it'll play in Peoria,\\" in reference to a decision by President Richard M. Nixon that seemed calculated to upset Easterners. Note that Safire attributed the origin to Ehrlichman, but was corrected by a letter the next week ‚Äî see Peoria, Illinois, cashed in on the free publicity with a successful advertising campaign to lure new business to the city. Peoria as test market In the United States, Peoria has long been seen as a prototypical American city, because of its representative demographics and its Midwestern culture, which is commonly perceived as mainstream. As a result, it has traditionally been one of the country's leading test markets. In the 1980s and '90s, comedians like Sam Kinison and musicians such as Bob Dylan, Robert Plant, Metallica and Phil Collins all perfected and launched concert tours in Peoria. During presidential campaigns, major TV networks would visit Peoria to gauge the response of everyday Americans on national issues and political candidates. However, demographic changes have made the city less representative of America as a whole, and therefore less attractive as a test market.

It is a commercial centre in the Northernmost part of the Eastern Cape History The town was named Aliwal North in tribute to Sir Harry Smith. Sir Harry Smith, then Governor of the Cape Colony, formally founded the small town of Aliwal North in the Cape Province of South Africa in 1850. He named the town \\"Aliwal\\" in memory of his victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Aliwal during the First Sikh War in India in 1846, and \\"North\\" in opposition to Aliwal South (now Mossel Bay).Dictionary Of Southern African Place Names p.56 & 57 The town was laid out in 1849 on ground acquired by the government. This was auctioned and 38 lots were sold for ¬£972. The park in the centre of Aliwal North, the Juana Square Gardens was named after Smith's wife Juana Maria de Los Dolores de Leon. One of the first white settlers in the area, Pieter Jacobus de Wet built a house at nearby Buffelsvlei around 1828. Municipal status was attained in 1882. The railway line from Molteno reached Aliwal North on 2 September 1885.

The Frere Bridge was opened in 1880 and later replaced with the General Hertzog Bridge, leading to Bloemfontein, 206 km to the north. To the south-west of the town, the Kramberg raises to 2000 m above sea level.  Layout  The central business district is surrounded by the following suburbs: Dukathole, Hilton, Joe Gqabi, the Springs (where the well-known Aliwal Spa is situated) and Arborsig. Many residents and staff of the Goedemoed Correctional Services facility (situated on the Free State side of the Orange River) also use the town's many businesses, hospital, churches and schools. The town is connected to neighbouring towns via a good roads system, and serve as a thoroughfare for tourists en route to resorts in die Eastern Cape Drakensberg. Unfortunately, the railway station had to close, due to lack of rail traffic. The town also has a good airfield with three grass runways, safe to be used during daylight.

The term is usually used to describe United States citizens who fomented insurrections in Latin America, particularly in the mid-19th century (Texas, California, Cuba, Nicaragua, Colombia). Filibuster expeditions have also occasionally been used as cover for government-approved deniable operations. Filibusters are irregular soldiers who normally act without official authority from their own government, and are generally motivated by financial gain, political ideology, or the thrill of adventure. The freewheeling actions of the filibusters of the 1850s led to the name being applied figuratively to the political act of filibustering in the United States Congress.William Safire, Safire's New Political Dictionary (2008) p 244 Unlike a mercenary, a filibuster works for himself, whilst a mercenary leader works for others.Axelrod, Alan Mercenaries: A Guide to Private Armies and Private Military Companies CQ Press, 9 January 2014 History Battle of San Jacinto in Nicaragua in 1856 The English term \\"filibuster\\" derives from the Spanish , itself deriving originally from the Dutch , 'privateer, pirate, robber' (also the root of English freebooter).Oxford English Dictionary, \\"freebooter\\". Retrieved 2012-10-26. The Spanish form entered the English language in the 1850s, as applied to military adventurers from the United States then operating in Central America and the Spanish West Indies.Oxford English Dictionary, \\"filibuster\\". Retrieved 2012-10-26. The Spanish term was first applied to persons raiding Spanish colonies and ships in the West Indies, the most famous of whom was Sir Francis Drake with his 1573 raid on Nombre de Dios. With the end of the era of Caribbean piracy in the early 18th century \\"filibuster\\" fell out of general currency. The term was revived in the mid-19th century to describe the actions of adventurers who tried to take control of various Caribbean, Mexican, and Central-American territories by force of arms. In Sonora, Mexico, there were the French Marquis Charles de Pindray and Count Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon and the Americans Joseph C. Morehead and Henry Alexander Crabb. The three most prominent filibusters of that era were Narciso L√≥pez and John Quitman in Cuba and William Walker in Baja California, Sonora, and lastly Nicaragua. The term returned to American parlance to refer to L√≥pez's 1851 Cuban expeditions. Several Americans were involved in freelance military schemes, including Aaron Burr, William Blount (West Florida), Augustus W. Magee (Texas), George Mathews (East Florida), George Rogers Clark (Louisiana and Mississippi), William S. Smith (Venezuela), Ira Allen (Canada), William Walker (Mexico and Nicaragua), William A. Chanler (Cuba and Venezuela) and James Long (Texas).Manifest Destiny's Underworld: Filibustering in Antebellum America, by Robert E. May. Chapter 1 Gregor MacGregor was a Scottish filibuster in Florida, Central, and South America. Although the American public often enjoyed reading about the thrilling adventures of filibusters, Americans involved in filibustering expeditions were usually in violation of the Neutrality Act of 1794 that made it illegal for a citizen to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. For example, the journalist John L. O'Sullivan, who coined the related phrase \\"Manifest Destiny\\", was put on trial for raising money for L√≥pez's failed filibustering expedition in Cuba. =William Walker= Filibuster William Walker launched several expeditions into Latin America In the 1850s, American adventurer William Walker launched several filibustering campaigns leading a private mercenary army. In 1853, he successfully established a short lived republic in the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. Later, when a path through Lake Nicaragua was being considered as the possible site of a canal through Central America (see Nicaragua canal), he was hired as a mercenary by one of the factions in a civil war in Nicaragua. He declared himself commander of the country's army in 1856; and soon afterward President of the Republic. After attempting to take control of the rest of Central America, while receiving no support from the U.S. government, he was defeated by the four other Central American nations he tried to invade and eventually executed in 1860 by the local Honduran authorities he tried to overthrow. In the traditional historiography by historians in both the United States and in Latin America, Walker's filibustering represented the high tide of antebellum American imperialism. His brief seizure of Nicaragua in 1855 is typically called a representative expression of Manifest destiny with the added factor of trying to expand slavery into Central America. Historian Michel Gobat, however, presents a strongly revisionist interpretation. He argues that Walker was invited in by Nicaraguan liberals who were trying to force economic modernization and political liberalism, and that thus it was not an attempted projection of American power.Michel Gobat, Empire by Invitation: William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America (Harvard UP, 2018). See this roundtable evaluation by scholars at H-Diplo. =Proto- Confederates= Prior to the American Civil war, many Confederate Army officers and soldiers, such as Chatham Roberdeau Wheat, of the Louisiana Tigers, obtained valuable military experience from filibuster expeditions. The author Horace Bell served as a major with Walker in Nicaragua in 1856. Colonel Parker H. French served as Minister of Hacienda and was appointed as Minister Plenipotentiary to Washington in 1855. Filibusters and the press There was widespread support in the press for filibusters' missions. A number of journalists, such as John O'Sullivan, Moses S. Beach at the New York Sun and the New Orleans' L. J. Sigur of the Delta, were sympathetic towards filibusters. All supported Narcisco Lopez's Missions to Cuba. John S. Thrasher contributed articles for the annexation of Cuba in New Orleans' Picayune. Some journalists also enlisted to fight for filibustering missions as Richardson Hardy and John McCann did who both worked for the Cincinnati Nonpareil. The poet Theodore O'Hara was a member of William Walker's expedition to Nicaragua. He worked on the Frankfort Yeoman and the Democratic Rally newspapers. After this, he served in the Confederate army in the American Civil War. Irish Americans and filibustering Irish Americans saw filibustering as an opportunity to aid Irish nationalists in their struggle against British rule. In 1856 a group of Irish Americans in Cincinnati were charged under the Neutrality Act 1818 with plotting a filibuster expedition to Ireland to help their brethren out. In this instance, the charges failed. William Seward and Robert Tyler helped with financing in order to form an Irish Brigade which also amassed armaments and men but this expedition did not take place at that time. An expedition did take place to Ireland in 1867 in order to support the Irish Republican Brotherhood rising that had started in February of that year but this ultimately failed. Canada was chosen as the next target which had been looked at earlier in the War of 1812. The Fenian Brotherhood was behind this and they made two incursions into Canada during 1866 both of which failed. Women's involvement with filibustering Women took an interest in filibustering which ensured that it was not just men who were involved. Their roles included planning, propaganda, participation, and popularization. Women also composed songs, arranged balls and concerts on behalf of the filibusters. Most of the interest came from women in the Gulf and Mid-Atlantic states as they were closer to the events. Correspondingly those in the Northern states tended not to take much interest in what was going on further south. Many women attended the filibuster expeditions as settlers, to help with casualties and to aid the expeditions in any way they could. Many women were at the front line experiencing first hand the armed engagements. A few even took up arms and used them to defend their men and property. Jane McManus Storm Cazneau was important for their role in negotiating between filibusters and U.S. politicians. She persuaded Moses S. Beach to promote lectures about William Walker and his group. It is possible she coined the term 'Manifest destiny' and not John O'Sullivan. All of these women embraced the idea of expansionism to spread slavery in the South. The language they sometimes used was equal to the men's. John Quitman's daughter Louisa used anti-Spanish rhetoric as she saw fit in order that the Spanish deserved to be punished for what they had done to Narcisco Lopez and his men after they had been taken prisoner. Filibusters and freemasonry Several well-known figures in filibusterism were also freemasons and this organization played a major role within the hierarchy of the filibusters. Narcisco L√≥pez and Jos√© Gonzales of the Cuban expedition were both freemasons. Other freemasons who took part in filibustering came from Louisiana and were involved with the 1810 incursion into West Florida. Later in 1836 freemasons were involved in the Texas Revolution. These included Stephen F. Austin, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar and David Crockett among others. Freemasons from New Orleans had helped in planning the liberation of Texas. Several lodges were an important element of the filibusters contributing many men to the cause of expansionism. Part of the masonic emphasis was that members should support their country's freedoms. During the period when Narcisco Lopez was planning his expedition to Cuba the Havana Club, founded in 1848 by Cuban freemasons, had endorsed the idea of inviting a filibuster expedition to Cuba in order to overthrow the colonial Spanish and free the island. The flag that Lopez and others designed for their expedition had masonic emblems built into it. These included representations of the mason's triangular apron. The Star of Texas was included to represent the five points of the fellowship of the masons. This flag was adopted as the Cuban national flag fifty-two years after Lopez's failed adventure. Other filibustering freemasons of note included Chatham Roberdeau Wheat and Theodore O'Hara the poet. They came from an extensive network of lodges in the Southern U.S. such as Soloman's Lodge No. 20 in Jacksonville and Marion Lodge No. 19 in Ocala. The reach of the masons was wide and helpful. On arriving at John Hardee Dilworth's estate, Jose Gonzales used freemasonry symbols which prevented him from being arrested as Dilworth was also a mason and had been told by Presidential order to arrest Gonzales. In the Philippines In the 19th-century Philippines, the Spanish gained connotations significantly different from those of the English derivative. The title of the highly influential novel by Philippine national hero Jos√© Rizal could literally be translated as \\"filibustering\\", but could also mean \\"subversion\\".  The 'Major F.P Hann' Hoax  The Frank Hann letters were a series of hoax letters published in 1895, purported to be written by a ‚ÄòMajor F.P. Hann‚Äô, who claimed to be an American filibuster fighting against the Spanish colonial rule of Cuba. Hann wrote a fake account of his supposed experiences in the Cuban War of Independence , detailing accounts of battles and operations that took place as well as commenting on the political situation within the country . The real Frank Hann, a twenty year old man who lived in Gainesville, Florida, used the pseudonym ‚ÄòAnderfer‚Äô in order to release the letters he forged, acting as a medium for the letters written by ‚ÄòMajor Hann‚Äô. He used the hoax to raise his own profile in the U.S as a war hero, while also attempting to garner support for filibuster missions in Cuba. The episode draws attention to the influence of the media and yellow journalism on American sentiment towards foreign affairs during the period. Legacy William Walker's filibusters are the subject of a poem by Ernesto Cardenal. Other media portrayal of filibustering include: Richard Harding Davis novels, The 1987 film Walker by Alex Cox, Joan Didion's A Book of Common Prayer, Ned Buntline's novels The B'hoys of New York and The Mysteries and Miseries of New Orleans and Lucy Petway Holcombe's The Free Flag of Cuba.

He was created a life peer in 1986. Early life He was the son of the Liberal activists Sir Maurice Bonham Carter and his wife, the former Lady Violet Asquith, daughter of the Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. He was the second-youngest of four children; Helen, Laura and Raymond. Educated at Winchester College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read PPE, his studies were interrupted by the Second World War, and he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards in November 1941. Captured in Tunisia in 1943 and imprisoned in Italy, he escaped and walked four hundred miles to return to British lines, being mentioned in dispatches. Bonham-Carter concluded the war by standing as the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Barnstaple in the 1945 general election,Baker, pp.62-3 before returning to finish the last year of his course at Oxford. He then spent a year at the University of Chicago before going into publishing, working for the Collins publishing firm but left as his directors did not agree with his political activities.Baker, p.64 In 1955, he married Leslie, Lady St Just, the former wife of Peter George Grenfell, 2nd Baron St Just (1922‚Äì1984), and the younger daughter of American magazine publisher Cond√© Nast. By her, Bonham-Carter had three daughters: Jane (created Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury), Virginia and Eliza Bonham Carter. He also had a stepdaughter from his wife's former marriage. Torrington Bonham-Carter's family continued its heavy involvement in Liberal politics, especially when his sister Laura married the Liberal leader Jo Grimond. It was in 1958 that the Torrington by-election was called in a safe Conservative seat, and Bonham- Carter became the Liberal candidate. Much to everyone's surprise, he won, overturning a 9,000 majority, giving the Liberals their first by-election gain since 1929. Bonham-Carter's margin of victory was extremely slim, at just 219 votes. Nonetheless, it was a major boost to the success-deprived Liberals and the first in a string of by-election victories that would make up the postwar Liberal Revival. Grimond was personally hopeful that the articulate Bonham- Carter would be his designated successor, but it was not to be: at the 1959 general election, just 18 months after his victory, he narrowly lost the seat to the Conservatives. He continued to be a close advisor to Grimond throughout the latter's leadership but would never again be an MP, despite a third, unsuccessful, and equally close candidature for Torrington at the 1964 general election. Later life Bonham Carter found other outlets for his political and publishing interests. He continued to work as a prominent member of the Collins firm, becoming close friends with Roy Jenkins (reportedly his wife's lover) and serving as his literary agent. He became the first Chairman of the Race Relations Board 1966‚Äì1971, and its successor, the Community Relations Commission 1971‚Äì1977. He was also prominent in the Arts world, as one of the Directors of the Royal Opera House 1958‚Äì1982, a Governor of the Royal Ballet 1960‚Äì1994 (Chairman of the Board after 1985), and Vice-chairman of the BBC 1975‚Äì1980, being vetoed as Chairman by Margaret Thatcher. On 21 July 1986 he was created a life peer as Baron Bonham-Carter, of Yarnbury in the County of Wiltshire. He became Foreign Affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. His last campaign focussed on granting British citizenship to ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, a measure that was only passed after his death. He was also an uncle of the actress Helena Bonham Carter. He died from a heart attack in Italy on 4 September 1994.

Geography The bridge crosses the P√°nuco River near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It connects the city of Tampico in Tamaulipas and Pueblo Viejo Municipality in Veracruz. Design and engineering The bridge has been in service since 1988 and was designed by Professor Modesto Armijo from COMEC, a Mexican engineering company. It was designed to withstand the severe Atlantic hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico. The bridge uses an orthotropic steel deck girder for a central section of the long main span, while the rest of the main span and the short lateral spans are a prestressed concrete girder. Both steel and concrete deck girders have the same external shape. This original design principle was later used for the main span of the Pont de Normandie, a cable-stayed bridge in Normandy, France. The dynamic analysis of the bridge under turbulent cyclonic winds, as well as the revision of the structural project, and the geometry plus stress control of the bridge during erection, were achieved by Alain Chauvin from Sogelerg, using the French \\"Scanner\\" computer program.

Early life  Hill was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire and educated at a school run by his father Thomas Wright Hill where he also taught when older. Later he worked at the Assay Office in Birmingham and then at a Birmingham brass-rolling mill where he became the manager. In 1819 he married Anne Bucknall and they had ten children. In 1827 he moved to Tottenham, London, where he managed a branch of the family school business while Rowland taught.

Inventions  Hill was an inveterate inventor of equipment to help the stamp department. He invented a mechanical system to make envelopes which was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the patent for which was bought by Warren de la Rue to whom the machine was attributed. On his retirement a Treasury minute praised Hill's \\"...resourcefulness and considerable mechanical ability which had contributed so much to the success of the new postage scheme\\".

Ancient Greek Colonization: the Ioanians in green The twelve ancient city-states were listed by Herodotus as:Herodotus. The Histories, 1.142. *Miletus, Myus, and Priene ‚Äî all located in Caria (a region in Asia Minor) and speaking the same dialect; *Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenae and Phocaea ‚Äî all located in Lydia and-or the region known today as Ionia (both also in Asia Minor, Lydia extending inland much farther relative to Ionia), speaking another dialect; *Chios (island) and Erythrae (Asia Minor) ‚Äî with a common dialect; and *Samos (island) ‚Äî with its own dialect. After 650 BC, Smyrna, an originally Aeolic city bordering the Ioanians, was invited to diminish Aeolis and increase Ionia by joining the league, which it did. One of our earliest historical sources, the Histories of Herodotus, and early inscriptions refer to the legally constituted body customarily translated by \\"league\\" as \\"the Ionians\\" in the special sense of the cities incorporated by it. One therefore reads of the cities, council or decisions \\"of the Ionians.\\" Writers and documents of the Hellenistic Period explicitly use the term koinon (\\"common thing\\") or synodos (\\"synod\\") of the Ionians, and by anachronism apply it to the early league when they mention it. The league was dissolved a few times and reconstituted a few times and in between its actual power varied. Under the Roman empire it was allowed to issue its own coinage under the name koinon I≈çn≈çn on one side with the face of the emperor on the other. Foundation The Meliac War was a final settlement between the ancient state of Caria and the Ionians who had been settlers on its land at the mouth of the Maeander for some centuries. Their last stronghold was the fortified settlement of Melia at the smaller peak of Dilek Daglari on the north slopes of Mycale, where the seat of their worship of Poseidon Heliconius was located. The fort was constructed in the early 7th century BC. Carians and Ionians had been intermarrying for generations but a Carian state persisted until a coalition of Ionian cities defeated it and divided its lands among them. In view of the rising Persian threat they decided to continue the coalition as the Ionian League, building a new religious and political center at Melia. Delegates (theoroi) of the league gathered to celebrate the Panionia, a religious festival and games (panegyris) dedicated to Poseidon Heliconius at the sanctuary of Poseidon called the Panionium. The Ionians (who had amalgamated with the Carians) had decided to continue the worship of Poseidon. Eventually, a new temple to the god was erected about 540 BC. Its ruins and the location of Melia were part of the Lohmann et al. discoveries of 2004. Prior to then, other theories of the location had been prevalent. Role in Ionian history The Ionian League was the first alliance of city-states in the region. Notes References * * Herodotus; Histories, A. D.

Mystery shoppers typically mirror common consumer behavior to test the consistency of the habits deemed important to a specific brands or industry. Mystery shoppers, which are gig workers or independent contractors submit detailed reports and feedback about their experiences. Industries and common usage Mystery shopping assessments and reports range from simple questionnaires to audio and video recordings. Mystery shopping can be used in any industry, from B2C and B2B, though B2B is more rare. The most common users of this research method include retail, hotels, movie theaters, restaurants and fast food chains, manufacturers of goods sold in retail and e-commerce. Also, included are banks, gas stations, automotive manufacturers and dealerships, transportation services, apartments, real estate and property management firms, health and fitness clubs, and human and pet health care. Growth The mystery shopping industry had an estimated value of nearly $600 million in the United States in 2004, according to a 2005 report commissioned by the Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA). Companies that participated in the report experienced an average growth of 11.1 percent from 2003 to 2004, compared to an average growth of 12.2 percent. The report estimates more than 8.1 million mystery shops were conducted in 2004. The report represents the first industry association attempt to quantify the size of the mystery shopping industry. The Independent Mystery Shoppers' Coalition reports there are 1.5 million mystery shoppers in the United States alone. Similar surveys are available for European regions where mystery shopping is becoming more embedded into company procedures. As a measure of its importance, customer/patient satisfaction is being incorporated more frequently into executive pay. A study by a U.S. firm found more than 55% of hospital chief executive officers surveyed in 2005 had \\"some compensation at risk,\\" based on patient satisfaction, up from only 8% to 20% a dozen years ago.\\"Health Care Taps 'Mystery Shoppers' at Wall Street Journal, August 8, 2006 In the United Kingdom, a Mystery Shoppers Practitioners' Group has been established under the auspices of the Market Research Society.

Ethics  Mystery shopping organizations advise that their research should only be used for employee incentive programs and that punishment or firing is an inappropriate use of mystery-shopper data. However, stories of employees being fired as a direct result of negative mystery shopper feedback are not uncommon. The Trade Organization for Mystery Shopping Providers, MSPA has defined a Code of Professional Standards and Ethics Agreement for Mystery Shopping Providers and for Mystery Shoppers. Other organizations that have defined standards for Mystery Shopping are ESOMAR, MRS and MRA. The most widely used set of professional guidelines and ethics standards for the Market Research industry is ISO. In the state of Nevada, mystery shoppers must be licensed by the PILB board and work under a company that has a private investigators license in order to perform mystery shopping jobs. Unlicensed mystery shoppers may face fines. In June 2008, the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs released a recommendation on the use of \\"secret shopper patients.\\" The Recommendation: \\"Physicians have an ethical responsibility to engage in activities that contribute to continual improvements in patient care. One method for promoting such quality improvement is through the use of secret shopper 'patients' who have been appropriately trained to provide feedback about physician performance in the clinical setting.\\" However, in 2009, the council decided to withdraw the report \\"in light of further testimony heard at the 2008 Interim Meeting [of the AMA House of Delegates].\\" UK case study  The UK government's Crown Commercial Service operated a mystery shopper scheme from February 2011 to November 2018, whose remit was to provide a route for suppliers to raise concerns about public procurement practice in England.Crown Commercial Service, Mystery Shopper: scope and remit, updated 28 January 2016, accessed 15 September 2016 The service was re-branded as the \\"Public Procurement Review Service\\" in November 2018 responding to feedback from suppliers and public bodies that the \\"mystery shopper\\" title did not properly reflect the role of the service.Cabinet Office, Mystery Shopper: Scope and Remit, updated 29 November 2018, accessed 4 January 2019 Additionally, since 2010, mystery shopping has become abundant in the medical tourism industry, with healthcare providers and medical facilities using the tool to assess and improve the customer service experience.Mystery shopping new trend in Medical Tourism, Novasans In the UK, mystery shopping is increasingly used to provide feedback on customer services provided by local authorities, and other non- profit organizations such as housing associations and even churches.

The film stars Miguel A. N√∫√±ez Jr. as Jamal Jeffries, a basketball star becoming a female impersonator and joining women's basketball, after being banned from men's basketball. The film also stars Vivica A. Fox, Kevin Pollak, Tommy Davidson, Kim Wayans, Ginuwine, and J. Don Ferguson. The movie was written by Bradley Allenstein and produced by Bill Gerber. The movie opened in theaters on June 21, 2002. The movie was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Charlotte Coliseum and the Independence Arena. The movie's soundtrack features music by Diana Ross, James Brown, Mystikal, Ginuwine, Lil' Kim and Stevie Wonder. The movie's soundtrack was score composed by Wendy & Lisa. The film's title is a play on a phrase: \\"You want a man?\\"  Plot  Jamal Jeffries (Miguel A. N√∫√±ez Jr.) is a UBA (a fictionalized version of the NBA) basketball star whose undisciplined on-and-off-court antics have earned him a bad reputation in the basketball community. Jamal is dropped from his team, the Charlotte Beat (a parody of the Charlotte Hornets) and suspended indefinitely after he strips naked in protest of being taken out of a game. His agent, Lorne Daniels (Kevin Pollak), is unsuccessful at finding him a new team, and decides to cut Jamal as a client. As a result, Jamal's life goes downhill: his endorsements drop him, he ends up bankrupt due to lavish spending, his belongings are repossessed, his mansion is foreclosed on, his girlfriend Tina (Lil' Kim), who only put up with his antics for his money and fame, walks out on him and he becomes homeless. Jamal, now deprived of his career and fortune, goes to live with his no-nonsense Aunt Ruby (Jenifer Lewis), the only person that doesn't put up with Jamal's outrageous antics. Lacking any other sort of skills, he decides to dress up as a woman named \\"Juwanna Mann\\" to play for the Charlotte Banshees (a parody of the Charlotte Sting) of the WUBA (a fictionalized version of the WNBA). Aunt Ruby reluctantly agrees to help him with his charade as does Lorne who has no choice after Jamal reveals himself to be Juwanna. In a scene involving the team physical, Jamal has to disguise himself as the team mascot in order to avoid being found out by the team physician. Jamal quickly becomes a star on the court, and his overall attitude changes drastically as well. He learns to play with a team rather than just himself. While becoming successful with the Banshees, Jamal also finds himself in a problematic relationship with his teammate Michelle (Vivica A. Fox), whom he has romantic feelings for but cannot act on because Michelle knows him only as her confidante, Juwanna. His situation is further complicated as Michelle is involved in a romantic relationship with Rapper Romeo (Ginuwine) (who ends up cheating on her) while Jamal (as Juwanna) is busy warding off the amorous advances of Romeo's hyper sidekick Puff Smokey Smoke (Tommy Davidson). Eventually, Jamal is given a chance to return to the men's league, but the hearing takes place at the same time as the Banshees' first playoff game. After much debate, Jamal decides to do the selfless thing and stick with the Banshees and help them win. Jamal's cover is blown at the end of the game when Jamal decides to dunk the winning basket and shatters the backboard. In all the excitement, Jamal loses his wig, revealing that he is in fact Jamal Jeffries. Jamal is fired from the team, and the Banshees, devastated at the betrayal, begin to suffer on the court as a result. Jamal, seeing this, decides to try to make things right again, and enters the Banshees' locker room during another game's halftime to apologize for the lies and tell them that playing with them had changed his views and attitude about basketball, women, and life in general. His ex-teammates (especially Michelle) are initially still furious at him, but end up accepting Jamal's genuine apology, which also inspires the team to win the playoffs and eventually the WUBA championship. Afterwards, Jamal is called in for a hearing with the UBA's commission board. Despite the genuine apology and assurance by himself and Lorne that he has changed for the better, the board is still unimpressed due to the Juwanna scandal, and it first appears that Jamal's playing career is truly done for. However, his former WUBA teammates show up and successfully vouch for him to be brought back into the league, and Michelle gives him a championship ring and a kiss. Jamal Jeffries is reinstated into the UBA and returns to action with his old team, a better player and person. Cast * Miguel A. N√∫√±ez Jr. as Jamal Jefferies/Juwanna Mann * Vivica A.

In his youth, Proske was a medical doctor, and worked for the Prussian military during the 1813-15 engagement. In 1821 he entered the seminary, and was ordained in Regensburg on April 11, 1826. The following year, he was made a vicar choral of Regensburg Cathedral. Proske was never to leave this post at Regensburg, and, in addition to his duties as a cleric, devoted all his energies and spent his entire private income on the restoration of what he called \\"vere musica ecclesiae,\\" the \\"true music of the Church.\\" This he considered to be the ancient Gregorian chant and especially the polyphonic works of the Renaissance masters (such as Palestrina, Nanini, Marenzio, Lassus, etc.). He searched all throughout Germany and Italy, making many trips to Rome, in order to collect ancient manuscripts for his library, which grew to contain thousands of samples (Karl Weinmann, a late 19th-century music researcher, claimed there were over 30,000 pages of manuscripts before Proske died). Proske was a pioneer in the field, and the fact that his editions reflected only the German, Flemish, and Italian repertoires - excluding Spaniards for the most part, though he did include Victoria - does not diminish his amazing contributions to Sacred music. In 1830 he was made Canon and Kapellmeister of Regensburg cathedral. Despite these new duties, Proske continued to spend hours transcribing and arranging ancient polyphony, and rounded up the greatest singers in his city in order to have them sight- sing his newly copied manuscript to check for part-writing errors. In 1853 Proske initiated the publication of his invaluable \\"Musica Divina\\", the fourth volume of which appeared in 1862 (finished by such prominent students as Franz Xaver Haberl).

The Altar of Victory () was located in the Roman Senate House (the Curia) and bore a gold statue of the goddess Victory. The altar was established by Octavian (later Augustus) in 29 BC to commemorate the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium. History The statue had been captured in 272 BC during the Pyrrhic War and was originally a representation of Nike. It depicted a winged goddess, holding a palm branch and descending to present a laurel wreath. A modern historian reflects on the importance of the altar and the statue: :At this Altar of Victory senators burned incense, offered prayers annually for the welfare of the empire, took their oaths and pledged on the accession of each new emperor. Thus the statue became one of the most vital links between the Roman state and Roman religion and also a tangible reminder of Rome's great past and her hopes for the future.Rev. James J. Sheridan, \\"The Altar of Victory‚ÄîPaganism's Last Battle\\" (hereafter Sheridan), p 187. Removal The altar was removed from the curia by the emperor Constantius II in 357. It was later restored by the emperor Julian, who was the only emperor after the conversion of Constantine I to reject Christianity. The altar was again removed by Gratian in 382. After Gratian's death, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, a senator and Prefect of Rome who sought to preserve Rome's religious traditions, in 384 wrote to the new emperor Valentinian II requesting the restoration of the altar.Symmachus, Relation III His request was met with strong resistance from Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.Ambrose, Epistles XVII and XVIII The imperial court at that time resided at Milan, and Ambrose held a great deal of influence over the young emperor. The request was denied. Further petitions to restore the altar were deflected in 391 by an edict of the emperor Theodosius I as part of his efforts to ensure that Christianity was the only religion practiced in the Empire. The altar was restored by the usurper Eugenius during his short-lived rule (392-394), according to Paulinus of Milan in his Life of Ambrose. Writing in A.D. 403, Claudian mentions that the statue (if not the altar) was then in the Senate House.Claud. VI Cons. Hon. 636. \\"Some think that removals and restorations refer to both the Altar of Victory and the Statue of Victory. Others think that the Statue was never removed from its place. There is no statement in the ancient authors as to what happened to the Statue when the Altar was removed and certainty on this point is unattainable.\\"Sheridan, p. 206.

There are over 200 franchise stores located in nine Canadian provinces. History Parkdale neighbourhood of Toronto No Frills in Markham The first No Frills store was a converted Loblaws outlet slated for closure. The store opened on July 5, 1978 in East York, Toronto. While it offered a very limited range of goods and basic customer service, the store promoted discount prices. The opening of the prototype outlet coincided with a period of rising inflation rates and consumer complaints regarding the high price of food. Similar limited variety supermarkets had been in operation in Europe for a number of years and in some countries had captured significant market share. Months earlier, Loblaw had launched a line of generic products called \\"No Name\\" that consisted of 16 unbranded items in very basic yellow and black packaging. The new line was promoted as offering savings of between 10 and 40 percent over comparable national brands. As No Name sales exceeded the company's own projections, Loblaws Supermarkets president Dave Nichol predicted the day when \\"limited line stores\\" would offer a complete assortment of No Name groceries While the first No Frills (originally branded no frills) featured the new generic product line, most items were still national brands. Though the European model typically offered dry goods, Loblaw promoted \\"fresh produce at the lowest possible price\\" as a way of attracting customers. Former logo in 2007. The banana was later removed along with a format change. In order to reduce costs as much as possible, No Frills customers had to forego some of the conveniences that North American supermarket shoppers had come to expect. Customers were required to pack their own groceries and bring their own shopping bags or pay three cents for each. The prototype store had only four checkout counters and operated on a \\"low labour\\" principle of minimal staffing. Product displays were purely functional with items left in their cardboard boxes with the front cut away. Produce, normally washed Nofrills sign and stacked, was left unwashed in its shipping carton. The original store did not offer fresh meat since refrigeration units had been removed to reduce expenses. Instead of the 8,000 items normally carried by the average supermarket, only 500 were available, usually represented by one brand and in only one size. Instead of each item individually marked, prices were displayed overhead and customers were provided with a price list. Cashiers underwent three weeks of training and were required to memorize all prices in the store. Loblaws president Dave Nichol promoted the minimalism of the new operations as a way to save money in a difficult economy. \\"We took all the frills out.\\" In spite of the limited product selection and minimal customer service, the first No Frills store, which advertised \\"the lowest overall food prices in Toronto\\", was successful from the initial launch. Opening day drew more shoppers than the store could handle. While some first day customers complained about the added inconveniences, most said they didn't mind and were pleased with the money they saved. With the successful launch of the prototype store, Loblaw began converting a number of its older, more marginal outlets to the new discount format. Within a few months, the company had opened three No Frills stores in Toronto. During the 1980s, the chain expanded beyond the Greater Toronto Area. In 1988, there were 19 No Frills stores located in Ontario. A year earlier, Loblaw began converting the outlets from company owned stores to franchise operations. The number of stores more than doubled to 48 by 1994. By the late 1990s, that number had increased to 79 outlets. The new franchise operations typically displayed the name of the owner, such as \\"Joe's nofrills\\" or \\"Derek's nofrills\\". While most No Frills stores were former Loblaws locations, the company had also acquired outlets. Three former Knob Hill Farms supermarkets in Toronto were converted to No Frills after the chain had closed all of its stores in 2001 due to increasing competition. In 2007, Loblaw began expanding No Frills beyond Ontario, first into Western Canada, and later into Atlantic Canada. Present Inside a typical No Frills store. Oak Ridges neighbourhood, Richmond Hill Presently, No Frills stores are much more like conventional supermarkets but continue to feature deep discount prices. Items are typically left in their cardboard shipping boxes but are arranged on store shelves and produce is conventionally displayed. While the original No Frills outlets stocked only the most basic products, today's stores offer a wide array of items and brands that include Loblaw's own private or 'control label' products. No Name, which is still heavily featured, has expanded from the original 16 items to more than 2,900 and the company's premium \\"President's Choice\\" line is readily available on store shelves. The range of services has also expanded with some outlets that offer fresh meat and fish counters, some which have premium offerings. Frozen food sections, excluded from the original stores due to the cost of refrigeration, are now standard. Other features remain unchanged, though, with No Frills customers still required to pack their own groceries and bring their own shopping bags or pay 5 cents per bag. Loblaw's other major supermarket chain, Loblaws which is considered a full- service supermarket, has been moved upmarket and features exclusive amenities not found in No Frills such as a bakery, deli, and fresh prepared-counter all in-store; at No Frills there is a much smaller selection of these types of foods which are prepared off-site and sent to the store. Some Loblaws stores have been converted into No Frills, even in affluent neighbourhoods like Bayview Hills in the Greater Toronto Area.

It is typically measured in terms of mass in picograms (trillionths (10‚àí12) of a gram, abbreviated pg) or less frequently in daltons, or as the total number of nucleotide base pairs, usually in megabases (millions of base pairs, abbreviated Mb or Mbp). One picogram is equal to 978 megabases. In diploid organisms, genome size is often used interchangeably with the term C-value. An organism's complexity is not directly proportional to its genome size; total DNA content is widely variable between biological taxa. Some single-celled organisms have much more DNA than humans, for reasons that remain unclear (see non-coding DNA and C-value enigma).  Origin of the term  Tree of life with genome sizes as outer bars The term \\"genome size\\" is often erroneously attributed to a 1976 paper by Ralph Hinegardner, even in discussions dealing specifically with terminology in this area of research (e.g., Greilhuber 2005). Notably, Hinegardner used the term only once: in the title. The term actually seems to have first appeared in 1968, when Hinegardner wondered, in the last paragraph of another article, whether \\"cellular DNA content does, in fact, reflect genome size\\". In this context, \\"genome size\\" was being used in the sense of genotype to mean the number of genes. In a paper submitted only two months later, Wolf et al. (1969) used the term \\"genome size\\" throughout and in its present usage; therefore these authors should probably be credited with originating the term in its modern sense. By the early 1970s, \\"genome size\\" was in common usage with its present definition, probably as a result of its inclusion in Susumu Ohno's influential book Evolution by Gene Duplication, published in 1970.  Variation in genome size and gene content With the emergence of various molecular techniques in the past 50 years, the genome sizes of thousands of eukaryotes have been analyzed, and these data are available in online databases for animals, plants, and fungi (see external links). Nuclear genome size is typically measured in eukaryotes using either densitometric measurements of Feulgen-stained nuclei (previously using specialized densitometers, now more commonly using computerized image analysis) or flow cytometry. In prokaryotes, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and complete genome sequencing are the predominant methods of genome size determination. Nuclear genome sizes are well known to vary enormously among eukaryotic species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold, and in land plants they differ by a factor of about 1,000. Protist genomes have been reported to vary more than 300,000-fold in size, but the high end of this range (Amoeba) has been called into question. In eukaryotes (but not prokaryotes), genome size is not proportional to the number of genes present in the genome, an observation that was deemed wholly counter-intuitive before the discovery of non-coding DNA and which became known as the \\"C-value paradox\\" as a result. However, although there is no longer any paradoxical aspect to the discrepancy between genome size and gene number, the term remains in common usage. For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested by one author to more accurately comprise a puzzle or an enigma (the so-called \\"C-value enigma\\"). Genome size correlates with a range of measurable characteristics at the cell and organism levels, including cell size, cell division rate, and, depending on the taxon, body size, metabolic rate, developmental rate, organ complexity, geographical distribution, or extinction risk. Based on currently available completely sequenced genome data (as of April 2009), log-transformed gene number forms a linear correlation with log- transformed genome size in bacteria, archaea, viruses, and organelles combined, whereas a nonlinear (semi-natural logarithm) correlation is seen for eukaryotes. Although the latter contrasts with the previous view that no correlation exists for the eukaryotes, the observed nonlinear correlation for eukaryotes may reflect disproportionately fast-increasing non-coding DNA in increasingly large eukaryotic genomes. Although sequenced genome data are practically biased toward small genomes, which may compromise the accuracy of the empirically derived correlation, and ultimate proof of the correlation remains to be obtained by sequencing some of the largest eukaryotic genomes, current data do not seem to rule out a possible correlation. Genome reduction Genome size compared to number of genes. Log-log plot of the total number of annotated proteins in genomes submitted to GenBank as a function of genome size. Based on data from NCBI genome reports. Genome reduction, also known as genome degradation, is the process by which an organism's genome shrinks relative to that of its ancestors. Genomes fluctuate in size regularly, and genome size reduction is most significant in bacteria. The most evolutionarily significant cases of genome reduction may be observed in the eukaryotic organelles known to be derived from bacteria: mitochondria and plastids. These organelles are descended from primordial endosymbionts, which were capable of surviving within the host cell and which the host cell likewise needed for survival. Many present-day mitochondria have less than 20 genes in their entire genome, whereas a modern free-living bacterium generally has at least 1,000 genes. Many genes have apparently been transferred to the host nucleus, while others have simply been lost and their function replaced by host processes. Other bacteria have become endosymbionts or obligate intracellular pathogens and experienced extensive genome reduction as a result. This process seems to be dominated by genetic drift resulting from small population size, low recombination rates, and high mutation rates, as opposed to selection for smaller genomes. Some free-living marine bacterioplanktons also shows signs of genome reduction, which are hypothesized to be driven by natural selection. =In obligate endosymbiotic species= Obligate endosymbiotic species are characterized by a complete inability to survive external to their host environment. These species have become a considerable threat to human health, as they are often capable of evading human immune systems and manipulating the host environment to acquire nutrients. A common explanation for these manipulative abilities is their consistently compact and efficient genomic structure. These small genomes are the result of massive losses of extraneous DNA, an occurrence that is exclusively associated with the loss of a free-living stage. As much as 90% of the genetic material can be lost when a species makes the evolutionary transition from a free-living to an obligate intracellular lifestyle. During this process the future parasite subjected to an environment rich of metabolite where somehow needs to hide within the host cell, those factors reduce the retention and increase the genetic drift leading to an acceleration of the loss of non-essential genes. Common examples of species with reduced genomes include Buchnera aphidicola, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Mycobacterium leprae. One obligate endosymbiont of leafhoppers, Nasuia deltocephalinicola, has the smallest genome currently known among cellular organisms at 112 kb.And the Genomes Keep Shrinking‚Ä¶ Despite the pathogenicity of most endosymbionts, some obligate intracellular species have positive fitness effects on their hosts. The reductive evolution model has been proposed as an effort to define the genomic commonalities seen in all obligate endosymbionts. This model illustrates four general features of reduced genomes and obligate intracellular species: #\\"genome streamlining\\" resulting from relaxed selection on genes that are superfluous in the intracellular environment; #a bias towards deletions (rather than insertions), which heavily affects genes that have been disrupted by accumulation of mutations (pseudogenes); #very little or no capability for acquiring new DNA; and #considerable reduction of effective population size in endosymbiotic populations, particularly in species that rely on vertical transmission of genetic material. Based on this model, it is clear that endosymbionts face different adaptive challenges than free-living species and, as emerged from the analysis between different parasites, their genes inventories are extremely different, leading us to the conclusion that the genome miniaturization follows a different pattern for the different symbionts. Conversion from picograms (pg) to base pairs (bp) :\\\\text{number of base pairs} = \\\\text{mass in pg}\\\\times9.78\\\\times10^8 or simply: :1\\\\text{pg} = 978 \\\\text{ Mbp} Drake's rule In 1991, John W. Drake proposed a general rule: that the mutation rate within a genome and its size are inversely correlated. This rule has been found to be approximately correct for simple genomes such as those in DNA viruses and unicellular organisms. Its basis is unknown. It has been proposed that the small size of RNA viruses is locked into a three-part relation between replication fidelity, genome size, and genetic complexity. The majority of RNA viruses lack an RNA proofreading facility, which limits their replication fidelity and hence their genome size. This has also been described as the \\"Eigen paradox\\". An exception to the rule of small genome sizes in RNA viruses is found in the Nidoviruses. These viruses appear to have acquired a 3‚Ä≤-to-5‚Ä≤ exoribonuclease (ExoN) which has allowed for an increase in genome size.  Genome miniaturization and optimal size  In 1972 Michael David Bennett hypothesized that there was a correlation with the DNA content and the nuclear volume while Commoner and van‚Äôt Hof and Sparrow before him postulated that even cell size and cell-cycle length were controlled by the amount of DNA. More recent theories have brought us to discuss about the possibility of the presence of a mechanism that constrains physically the development of the genome to an optimal size. Those explanations have been disputed by Cavalier-Smith‚Äôs article where the author pointed that the way to understand the relation between genome size and cell volume was related to the skeletal theory. The nucleus of this theory is related to the cell volume, determined by an adaptation balance between advantages and disadvantages of bigger cell size, the optimization of the ratio nucleus:cytoplasm (karyoplasmatic ratio) and the concept that larger genomes provides are more prone to the accumulation of duplicative transposons as consequences of higher content of non-coding skeletal DNA. Cavalier-Smith also proposed that, as consequent reaction of a cell reduction, the nucleus will be more prone to a selection in favor for the deletion compared to the duplication. From the economic way of thinking, since phosphorus and energy are scarce, a reduction in the DNA should be always the focus of the evolution, unless a benefit is acquired. The random deletion will be then mainly deleterious and not selected due to the reduction of the gained fitness but occasionally the elimination will be advantageous as well. This trade-off between economy and accumulation of non-coding DNA is the key to the maintenance of the karyoplasmatic ratio.  Mechanisms of genome miniaturization  The base question behind the process of genome miniaturization is whether it occurs through large steps or due to a constant erosion of the gene content. In order to assess the evolution of this process is necessary to compare an ancestral genome with the one where the shrinkage is supposed to be occurred. Thanks to the similarity among the gene content of Buchnera aphidicola and the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli, 89% identity for the 16S rDNA and 62% for orthologous genes was possible to shed light on the mechanism of genome miniaturization. The genome of the endosymbiont B. aphidicola is characterized by a genome size that is seven times smaller than E. coli (643 kb compared to 4.6 Mb) and can be view as a subset of the enteric bacteria gene inventory. From the confrontation of the two genomes emerged that some genes persist as partially degraded. indicating that the function was lost during the process and that consequent events of erosion shortened the length as documented in Rickettsia. This hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of the pseudogenes of Buchnera where the number of deletions was more than ten times higher compared to the insertion. In Rickettsia prowazekii, as with other small genome bacteria, this mutualistic endosymbiont has experienced a vast reduction of functional activity with a major exception compared to other parasites still retain the bio-synthetic ability of production of amino acid needed by its host. The common effects of the genome shrinking between this endosymbiont and the other parasites are the reduction of the ability to produce phospholipids, repair and recombination and an overall conversion of the composition of the gene to a richer A-T content due to mutation and substitutions. Evidence of the deletion of the function of repair and recombination is the loss of the gene recA, gene involved in the recombinase pathway. This event happened during the removal of a larger region containing ten genes for a total of almost 10 kb. Same faith occurred uvrA, uvrB and uvrC, genes encoding for excision enzymes involved in the repair damaged DNA due to UV exposure. One of the most plausible mechanisms for the explanation of the genome shrinking is the chromosomal rearrangement because insertion/deletion of larger portion of sequence are more easily to be seen in during homologous recombination compared to the illegitimate, therefore the spread of the transposable elements will positively affect the rate of deletion. The loss of those genes in the early stages of miniaturization not only this function but must played a role in the evolution of the consequent deletions. Evidences of the fact that larger event of removal occurred before smaller deletion emerged from the comparison of the genome of Bucknera and a reconstructed ancestor, where the gene that have been lost are in fact not randomly dispersed in the ancestor gene but aggregated and the negative relation between number of lost genes and length of the spacers. The event of small local indels plays a marginal role on the genome reduction especially in the early stages where a larger number of genes became superfluous. Single events instead occurred due to the lack of selection pressure for the retention of genes especially if part of a pathway that lost its function during a previous deletion. An example for this is the deletion of recF, gene required for the function of recA, and its flanking genes. One of the consequences of the elimination of such amount of sequences affected even the regulation of the remaining genes. The loss of large section of genomes could in fact lead to a loss in promotor sequences. This could in fact pushed the selection for the evolution of polycistronic regions with a positive effect for both size reduction and transcription efficiency.  Evidence of genome miniaturization  One example of the miniaturization of the genome occurred in the microsporidia, an anaerobic intracellular parasite of arthropods evolved from aerobic fungi. During this process the mitosomes was formed consequent to the reduction of the mitochondria to a relic voided of genomes and metabolic activity except to the production of iron sulfur centers and the capacity to enter into the host cells. Except for the ribosomes, miniaturized as well, many other organelles have been almost lost during the process of the formation of the smallest genome found in the eukaryotes. From their possible ancestor, a zygomycotine fungi, the microsporidia shrunk its genome eliminating almost 1000 genes and reduced even the size of protein and protein-coding genes. This extreme process was possible thanks to the advantageous selection for a smaller cell size imposed by the parasitism. Another example of miniaturization is represented by the presence of nucleomorphs, enslaved nuclei, inside of the cell of two different algae, cryptophytes and chlorarachneans. Nucleomorphs are characterized by one of the smallest genomes known (551 and 380 kb) and as noticed for microsporidia, some genomes are noticeable reduced in length compared to other eukaryotes due to a virtual lack of non-coding DNA. The most interesting factor is represented by the coexistence of those small nuclei inside of a cell that contains another nucleus that never experienced such genome reduction. Moreover, even if the host cells have different volumes from species to species and a consequent variability in genome size, the nucleomorph remain invariant denoting a double effect of selection within the same cell.

Robertson was best known as an advocate of the Christ myth theory.  Biography  Robertson was born in Brodick on the Isle of Arran; his father moved the family to Stirling while he was still young, and he attended school there until the age of 13. He worked first as a clerk and then as a journalist, eventually becoming assistant editor of the Edinburgh Evening News. He wrote in February 1906 to a friend that he \\"gave up the 'divine'\\" when he was a teenager.Wells, G.A. Ed. (1987) J.M. Robertson (1856‚Äì1933) Liberal, Rationalist, and Scholar: An Assessment by Several Hands Edited by G.A. Wells. London; Pemberton, p. 13. His first contact with the freethought movement was a lecture by Charles Bradlaugh in Edinburgh in 1878. Robertson became active in the Edinburgh Secular Society, soon after. It was through the Edinburgh Secular Society that he met William Archer and became writer for the Edinburgh Evening News. He eventually moved to London to become assistant editor of Bradlaugh's paper National Reformer, subsequently taking over as editor on Bradlaugh's death in 1891. The National Reformer finally closed in 1893. Robertson was also an appointed lecturer for the freethinking South Place Ethical Society from 1899 until the 1920s. An advocate of the \\"New Liberalism,\\" Robertson's political radicalism developed in the 1880s and 1890s, and he first stood for Parliament in 1895, failing to win Bradlaugh's old seat in Northampton as an independent radical liberal. Robertson was a staunch free trader and his Trade and Tariffs (1908) \\"became a bible for free- traders pursuing the case for cheap food and the expansion of trade\\".Michael Freeden, 'Robertson, John Mackinnon (1856‚Äì1933)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 5 April 2009. In 1915 he was appointed to the Privy Council. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, as a Liberal candidate he contested Wallsend, a constituency based largely on his Tyneside seat, but finished third. He contested the 1923 United Kingdom general election as Liberal candidate for Hendon without success. Robertson died in London in 1933. Homer Smith has described Robertson as an \\"outstanding exponent of rationalism and one of the foremost scholars produced in England in the last six decades.\\"Smith, Homer W. (1952). Man and His Gods. Little, Brown and Company. p. 477 Electoral record Robertson Robertson  Political views  Economically, Robertson has been described as an underconsumptionist, and he gave an early form, perhaps the earliest formal statement, of the paradox of thrift in his 1892 book The Fallacy of Saving. He was in favour of the payment of MPs, the Abolition of the House of Lords and the establishment of Adult Suffrage, including giving votes to women.Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1907 Christ myth theory Robertson was an advocate of the Christ myth theory, and in several books he argued that Jesus was not a historical person, but was an invention by a first-century Jewish messianic cult of Joshua, whom he identifies as a solar deity. In Robertson's view, religious groups invent new gods to fit the needs of the society of the time. Robertson argued that a solar deity symbolized by the lamb and the ram had long been worshiped by an Israelite cult of Joshua and that this cult had then invented a new messianic figure, Jesus of Nazareth. Robertson argued that a possible source for the Christian myth may have been the Talmudic story of the executed Jesus Pandera which dates to 100 BC. the possibility that the stories of a would be messiah who preached \\"a political doctrine subversive of the Roman rule, and . . . thereby met his death\\" and \\"Galilean faith-healer with a local reputation may have been slain as a human sacrifice at some time of social tumult\\" being added to the original mythology.Robertson, Archibald (1946) Jesus: Myth Or History pg 44 Robertson considered the letters of Paul the earliest surviving Christian writings, but viewed them as primarily concerned with theology and morality, rather than historical details: Robertson viewed references to the twelve apostles and the institution of the Eucharist as stories that must have developed later among gentile believers who were converted by Jewish evangelists like Paul. Oxford theologian and orientalist Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare wrote a book titled, The Historical Christ; or, An investigation of the views of Mr. J. M. Robertson, Dr. A. Drews, and Prof. W. B. Smith (1913), directed against the Christ myth theory defended by the three authors.

The Republic of Colombia has an area of 439,735 square miles (1,138,908 square kilometers) and its population is estimated at 46 million. Although the Government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, a 2001 poll commissioned by the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, indicated that the religious demography is as follows: *56.2% Roman Catholic Christians. *20% Non-evangelical Protestant Christians *6.2% Evangelical Protestant Christians *11.3% No religious beliefs *3.6% Other faiths: **Seventh-day Adventist Church: about 180,000 members **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: about 130,000 members **Jehovah's Witnesses: about 320,000 members. **Judaism: between 10,000 and 40,000 members. **Islam: figures unknown, probably 180,128. *60% reported not practising their faith actively.  Other religious statistics  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Orthodox Catholic Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and primary songwriter of the rock band Collective Soul. He is also active with his side project, Ed Roland and the Sweet Tea Project. Life and career After finishing high school, Roland studied songwriting and guitar at Berklee College of Music in Boston for one year. He was the lead engineer and producer at Real 2 Reel Studios in Stockbridge, Georgia for eight years. In 1985, he was in a band called The Eddie Band and another during the late 1980s and early 1990s called Marching Two-Step, which also included future producer and music executive Matt Serletic, future executive Michelle Rhea Caplinger and longtime Collective Soul drummer Shane Evans. Roland released an indie album called Ed-E Roland in 1991. The album was meant to showcase his abilities to compose, record, and produce his own original music. Roland changed the name of his band to Collective Soul with hopes of finding success in the music business. Not finding success, however, Roland became frustrated and almost gave up on the music industry. He had been active in the local Georgia music scene since the early 1980s. Despite the initial rejections, Collective Soul independently released Hints, Allegations & Things Left Unsaid in 1993 on a label called Rising Storm. It was a compilation of some of Roland's songwriting demos created when he worked at Real 2 Reel Studios. This collection eventually caught the attention of a college radio station in Orlando, Florida. Several other college radio stations began to play \\"Shine\\" and it became an underground hit. The popularity of the song and band was convincing enough that Atlantic Records signed Collective Soul in 1993 to a long term major label contract. \\"Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid\\" was re-released worldwide in early 1994. The band experienced a sudden rise from obscurity to fame. Ed's brother Dean is also a member of the band. Their father was a Southern Baptist minister which influenced their spiritual background; however, Ed has cited that Collective Soul is not a Christian rock band.Garrett, Jonathan A RETURN TO HAVING FUN: Collective Soul Remembers Why It Makes Music PopMatters (January 25, 2005).

In Europe (and other PAL locations) Monster Rancher 2 is the first release in the series and is thus named Monster Rancher. A port for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android has been released in Japan on September 17, 2020. Gameplay This game involves raising, fighting, and breeding monsters. The main character is never seen on screen and never talks to anyone directly. Instead, all of the dialog and action is done by the trainer's assistant Colt and her toucan Joy. The player chooses their actions and choices through menu options. Tournaments, from which money, items, and fame can be earned, are held throughout the year. However, only by winning an IMa Official Cup, four of which are held each year, can breeders and monsters earn higher ranks. As a monster's rank increases, it gains access to higher level tournaments. Monsters begin life knowing a small number of moves that can be used in battle, with more learned through training. To perform a move, a monster must expend some ‚Äúguts,‚Äù which regenerate constantly during battle. Each move can only be performed while within a particular range of an opponent, and from close range monsters can knock opponents back. Besides the monster types you can unlock from the beginning, there are many more which you can raise. There are three different ways in which to unlock new monster types for raising: plot events, expedition, and errantry. The most common way these new monsters are given to you is by the gain of an item, which when used to combine monsters, will produce this new type. After that happens, CDs will now be allowed to produce monsters of that type. Story The story of Monster Rancher 2 is largely non-linear with story events happening only after certain requirements are met (winning a battle, reaching a certain rank, etc.). The story begins with the main character going to register to become a trainer, it is there when Colt appears as the trainer's new official assistant. The \\"end\\" of the game is when a monster is able to beat the Big Four (the four highest ranked battles in the game) when this happens a video about the history of the monsters is shown. A monster who has beaten all four of the S class tournaments can then go on to compete in a special match for champion monsters like itself. It is important to note that Monster Rancher 2 happens in close time proximity to Monster Rancher 1, but on a different continent (MR2 being set in the IMA area, and MR1 set in the FIMBA area), because of this there is a special battle between the player and the assistant from the first game, Holly. This event takes place every four years, much like the Summer Olympics, and the player's monster has to be of certain rank to gain entry to. The event is called the IMA vs. FIMBA meet and always takes place in the last week of August. The player must win the preceding entry tournament first, which always takes place in the last week of July, respectively. Defeating the Major 4 tournaments and the Legend Cup does not unlock all of the monsters in the game. There are different steps to take to unlock each main breed monster. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews, albeit slightly less than the original game, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40.

The advance of these low-born provincials was facilitated by a major shift in imperial policy from the time of Gallienus (260‚Äì268) on, when higher military appointments ceased to be exclusively filled by senators. Instead, professional soldiers of humble origin who had risen through the ranks to the post of primus pilus (which also entailed admission to the equestrian order) were placed as heads of the legions and filled the army's command structure. The historical period of the Illyrian emperors proper begins with Claudius Gothicus in 268 and continues in 284 with the rise of Diocletian and the institution of the Tetrarchy.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, p. 264 This period was very important in the history of the Empire, since it represents the recovery from the Crisis of the Third Century, a long period of usurpations and military difficulties. All of the Illyrian emperors were trained and able soldiers, and they recovered most of the provinces and positions lost by their predecessors, including Gaul and the eastern provinces. Men of Illyrian or Thraco-Dacian origin however continued to be prominent in the Empire throughout the 4th century and beyond.

The Manifesto focused largely on divorcing art from such conventions as use of lines, color, volume, and mass. In the text, Gabo and Pevsner reject the successive stylistic innovations of modern art as mere illusionism (beginning with Impressionism, and including Cubism and Futurism), advocating instead an art grounded in the material reality of space and time: \\"The realization of our perceptions of the world in the forms of space and time is the only aim of our pictorial and plastic art.\\"\\"The Realistic Manifesto.\\" In Art in Theory, 1900-2000, edited by Charles Harrison and Paul Wood, 299.

It was created in 1989 by Garry Leach and Dave Elliott. In 2004 it was restarted, publishing new and old material. Publication history The first series (from the late 1980s) comprised six issues, plus the A1 Bikini Confidential. Page-count varied around the 64-128 range. Most stories were one-off showcases, sometimes featuring characters that had publishing history elsewhere (e.g. Concrete, Mr. Monster, Mr. X, the American, Flaming Carrot). \\"Bricktop\\" was the one ongoing serialized story, though The Bojeffries Saga by Alan Moore and Steve Parkhouse appeared as self-contained stories in almost every issue. Issue 6 was numbered \\"6A\\" and a proposed \\"6B\\" never saw print, although most of the stories did see print in other publications, such as Heavy Metal magazine. In 1992 a second series of A1 appeared under Marvel Comics's Epic Comics imprint, edited by Dave Elliott. These were four 48-page color books featuring work from Dave McKean, Kent Williams, Scott Hampton, George Pratt, P. Craig Russell, Glenn Fabry, Pedro Henry, and many others, including the late Martin Emond. In 2004 Atomeka started publishing A1 again starting with A1 Big Issue Zero. It featured a Bojeffries Saga story that had originally appeared in two parts in Warrior with an introduction that was produced for the U.S. market to introduce the tone of the material. The new material for that issue was a strip by Steve Pugh called Shark-Man. Shark-Man eventually had a three issue run in full colour in 2008 published by Image Comics.

It is the third and final novel of the Blue Lagoon trilogy which began with The Blue Lagoon (1908) and continued with The Garden of God (1923). Stacpoole wrote this third book as a kind of expos√© of the despoiling of South Sea Island cultures and people by Europeans. His introduction says: :Never in the history of the world has ruin fallen on a people as it has fallen upon the natives of these far islands; nowhere else will you find the remains of a once noble race left in its original setting of pure air, yet stinking of gin and petrol and exhibited at times to the world between the finger and thumb of Romance or Realism. Could it speak, this remnant, would it not say: \\"White man, you have taken from us all good things but Death; you have given us all bad things but Pride; make one return -- Silence. Do not write about us; or, writing, remember only what we were\\"? Plot summary The novel picks up a day or so after the events at the conclusion of The Garden of God. Dick Lestrange, son of Dicky and Emmeline Lestrange, is about fourteen or fifteen. He has come to love Katafa, a Spanish girl who is the adopted daughter of the Kanaka people of the island of Karolin, about forty miles from the island (Palm Tree) where his parents lived. Now she has brought him to her island, and due to a series of complicated political circumstances, the people have declared him their new king. Dick is not unwilling to lead the people, but needs advice and guidance. He also sees immediately that the island has a defense problem. In The Garden of God, all the Karolin men of warrior age and status have died as the result of an ill-advised attack on Palm Tree‚Äîand all their war canoes were burned. Fishing canoes still exist, but new war canoes must be built at once. The Melanesian slaves who took over Palm Tree at the end of The Garden of God were all men; if they decide to make Palm Tree (which the Kanaka call Marua) their permanent home, they will attack Karolin, the nearest island, to steal women. He is sent for three elderly men, expert canoe-builders, from the southern side of the immense island; but the ladies who took his message return without them, saying they do not acknowledge Taori (Dick) as their leader. Dick goes in person to explain the situation and meets Aioma, the oldest canoe-builder, and his granddaughter Le Moan, age fourteen, who falls in love with Dick on sight. She has no idea that Dick is already married, let alone that his bride is her own Aunt Katafa (Katafa being an adopted daughter of the late priestess Le Juan and therefore sister to Le Jenabon, Le Juan's biological daughter, who is Le Moan's mother). Left alone on the southern shore when all the other people from the south side go north to help with the canoe building, Le Moan sees the Kermadec, a schooner full of white men, sail into the lagoon. Thinking they might attack the people, and especially Dick, Le Moan tells them that she is alone on the island, that everyone else died in a storm. Captain Peterson, a rough and ferocious-looking but kindhearted man, takes her aboard and gives her over to Sru, his Paomotuan assistant, to stay with the Kanaka crew until he can find her a place to live on another island. Talking with Le Moan, Sru learns two things; the girl has a gift of absolute direction and can find her way to any place she has ever been without need of a compass; and she wears a very large double pearl ornament, which tells Sru that Karolin's lagoons are full of pearls. Sru encourages her to confide in him, including the part about her being in love with Dick and trying to protect him. She also tells him that the lagoon is indeed thick with pearl oysters. Sru tells her Captain Peterson would never have harmed Dick or the people, but that he must not be told about the pearls, because he is something of a profiteer and might take everything for himself. He spends the next few weeks teaching her how to steer the ship. With first mate Rantan and a beachcomber named Carlin who is hitching a ride on the ship to go to the northern islands, Sru plans and carries out a mutiny, killing both Peterson and a white sandalwood trader‚Äîand framing the natives of the island where the sandalwood trader lived for the murder. Meanwhile, Aioma is enthusiastically directing the people in the building of new war canoes and conversing endlessly with Dick about boats, about the model ships built long ago by Kearney and treasured by Dick as his one remaining link with his old life. Aioma has also become Dick's chief of staff, so to speak, advising him about etiquette and his duties as king (for instance, he warns Dick that he must not lower himself to work with the people, because to be seen as their equal is unfitting). The Kermadec returns to Karolin, guided by Le Moan, who remains on board as Rantan and Carlin go ashore, shoot a number of the people including two babies, and break up the half-finished canoes. Returning to the Kermadec they tell the Kanaka crew that the people of Karolin attacked them, but Le Moan saw what really happened and tells the crew later, advising them that the people of Karolin are good and will accept them if they go ashore in peace. Le Moan manages to kill Carlin, and tries to kill Rantan; as he defends himself, she is rescued by crewman Kanoa, who is secretly in love with her. They tie up Rantan and deliver him into the hands of the Karolin people, who indeed welcome the Kanaka from the Kermadec in peace and friendship. Dick gives Rantan to the mothers of the babies who died, to do with as they see fit. Only now does Le Moan discover that Dick and Katafa are married. A few days later, the tide goes out at half flood and returns with a vengeance, like a tsunami. Three great waves sweep the island, destroying everything, while the people take to the trees. In the next hours huge flocks of birds are seen in the skies, coming from the direction of Palm Tree. When Aioma, Dick, and Le Moan decide to take the Kermadec out on the ocean so that the men can learn to steer it properly, they make for Palm Tree, only to discover that it has completely sunk beneath the ocean. The island of the Blue Lagoon is no more. Aioma believes this is a sign, not from the gods, but from Uta Matu, the late king of Karolin, whose warriors Dick is responsible for having killed (though they mostly killed each other). Le Moan, hearing this, decides to try to keep Dick for herself by steering away from Karolin and pretending she has lost her gift of direction (implying it is the curse of Uta Matu). Dick, devastated by the loss of his former home, is so desperate to get back to Karolin and Katafa that he takes ill. Le Moan cannot stand his suffering, gives up, and declares that her direction-sense has come back and steers the Kermadec for home. On the way, they encounter an abandoned ship. Aioma, unwisely, takes out his frustration with the papalagi (foreigners) and their ships by boarding this one‚Äîfull of dead bodies‚Äîand setting fire to it. He proceeds to do the same to the Kermadec when they get back to Karolin. What he does not know is that his contact with the abandoned ship has infected him with the measles. By evening of the next day everybody on Karolin has caught it, and having no resistance, nearly everyone dies. Katafa is frantic with grief, because Dick has caught it too, and is lying delirious, speaking only in English. Le Moan blames herself; if she had never asked the Kermadec for a lift, none of this would have happened. She believes the curse of Uta Matu, and of her own grandmother Le Juan, have brought shame, disgrace, sickness and death to her people. She calls out to Katafa, \\"Taori will not die: I go to save him; the nets are spread for him, but I will break them -- I, who have brought this evil.\\" The instant she speaks these words, Dick's fever cools down and he begins to improve. As Katafa goes to care for him, Le Moan gets in her fishing boat. Sailing it clear out to sea, she takes the sail down, lies down in the bottom, and gives herself to the gods. Stacpoole ends the story by saying that to this day, Karolin remains unexplored and uncharted, because try as they might, no one can ever quite get there.

Atomeka ceased publishing in 1997, was briefly revived from 2002 to 2005 and revived again in 2013. History Atomeka was established as a company offering creators complete freedom over their material, as well as the opportunity to own all the rights to their creations. Their first title, A1, was an anthology featuring the likes of Ted McKeever, Alan Moore, Glenn Fabry, and Simon Bisley. Seeing who was involved in the project it was natural that A1 contained some stories that were continuations of Warrior strips such as The Bojeffries Saga and Warpsmith, written by Alan Moore with art by Steve Parkhouse and Garry Leach respectively. During its run A1 won several awards, including the 1990 Harvey Award for best anthology. During the 1990s, Atomeka continued publishing A1, as well as related specials such as A1: Bikini Confidential. They company also published some of Simon Bisley's creator-owned work during this period, in titles such as Monster Massacre and Heavy Metal. In 1992, Elliott solo-edited a four-issue sequel to A1 in colour for Marvel Comics's Epic Comics imprint. As Tundra UK's publisher, in 1992 Dave Elliott began using the Atomeka imprint to establish its own identity within the larger company; he was also responsible for titles with all the British comic creators. Elliott brought two titles he started at John Brown Publishing, Lazarus Churchyard and White Trash, with him to complete with Tundra UK/Atomeka. With Tundra UK's demise in 1993, Elliott started Blackball Comics.\\"Newswatch:Dave Elliott Forms Blackball Comics\\". The Comics Journal (165): 14. January 1994. In 1997, Atomeka ceased publishing, as Elliott and Leach pursued other projects. = 2002 relaunch = In 2002 Atomeka was resurrected to publish Simon Bisley's Maximum Force. In 2004 Elliott and Leach resurrected the company, in cooperation with Ross Richie, publishing A1 Big Issue Zero, Bricktop, Mister Monster: Worlds War Three, and Stalkers, featuring a mix of reprint material. Richie generated his own new projects under the Atomeka banner, such as Hero Squared and G.I. Spy as well as new work from the likes of Mike Mignola with Jenny Finn. The team-up didn't last long, as Richie left to form his own company, Boom! Studios, taking Squared, Spy, and Finn with him. In late 2004 the A1 Sketchbook was released in part by the artist responsible for re-creating Marvelman with Alan Moore, Garry Leach and Atomeka Press. It contained four Marvelman-related pin-ups (although the pin-ups were not directly said to be Marvelman for possible legal reasons). A variant of the sketchbook was also produced, and it featured a Marvelman front cover and Kid Marvelman back cover by Leach. In 2005 the company published a three-part reissue of Ted McKeever's Eddy Current, and also one (of three planned) \\"Bojeffries Terror Tomes\\", reprinting The Bojeffries Saga by Alan Moore and Steve Parkhouse, and featuring additional work by Neil Gaiman and Michael Zulli, Ramsey Campbell and David Lloyd, Michael T.

History The Government General Hospital was established on 16 November 1664 to treat soldiers of the British East India Company. Mary Scharlieb graduated from Madras Medical College in 1878. In 1996, when the metropolis of Madras was renamed as Chennai, the college was renamed the Chennai Medical College. It was later re-renamed back to the Madras Medical College since the college was known worldwide by the older name. The foundation stone for the new building of the college was laid by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, on 28 February 2010.\\"Karunanidhi to lay foundation stone for MMC building\\", The Hindu, 12 February 2010. In January 2011, the hospital was renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.\\"General Hospital to be named after Rajiv Gandhi\\", The Hindu, 13 January 2011. Red Fort building A red-brick heritage structure known as the \\"Red Fort\\" stands to the east of the MMC buildings. Built in 1897, it has been classified as a Grade I heritage building by the Justice E. Padmanabhan Committee on heritage structures. It housed the anatomy department for several decades, which was partially moved to the new campus of the MMC at the erstwhile Central Prison campus in 2013. In December 2017, the PWD started the restoration of the heritage structure at a cost of 19.7 million. Once restored, the structure will be converted to a museum, with the ground floor showcasing the history of MMC and the first- floor showcasing specimens for comparative anatomy. New campus A new campus with a six-storeyed building for Madras Medical College was built on land covering on the erstwhile central prison premises in 2010 and was completed in 2012. The campus has nearly 1,250 students and 400 faculty and staff members. The campus was built at a cost of 566.3 million and started functioning in 2013. The old MMC buildings presently house the college of pharmacy, school of nursing and also accommodate students of the recently added courses of audiology, speech learning and pathology, radiotherapy and radio diagnosis. Affiliation Since 1857, the college has been affiliated to the University of Madras and all degrees of Health Sciences were awarded by the same until 1988 when the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University Act, 1987 received the assent of the president of India. This affiliating university started functioning from July 1988 and is governed by the said Act. The college was declared as an independent university called the Madras Medical College and Research Institute (MMC & RI). Later the status as an independent university was withdrawn shortly afterwards and the college was affiliated back to the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

History  On a day in the spring of 1873 Charles H. Hardin, Mexico attorney and future governor of Missouri, presented to the City Board of Education his check for $3,500, taking the first step in establishing ‚Äúan institution of learning for the education of females‚Äù to be known as Hardin College. With this action he purchased a two-story frame structure that was built in 1857 as a private school and later used for public school classes, along with its surrounding five acres of land located near South Jefferson on the outskirts of town. For the next half-century Hardin College flourished as an outstanding school for young women. Cover of the 1919 Hardin College News Letter Classes began in the fall of 1873. Two academic courses were offered: the Preparatory, consisting of basic primary studies, and the Collegiate, covering advanced classes. Seventeen girls enrolled in the former, seventy-three in the latter. They expected ‚Äúwide-awake and energetic teaching,‚Äù a high standard of scholarship and, besides class recitations, daily drills in penmanship, vocal music, drawing, and the correct use of the English language. Over the years methods and courses changed, with increasing emphasis upon the collegiate course. By 1901 Hardin was recognized as the first junior college in the state, her graduates being granted advanced standing at many institutions. Attracting students from Illinois, Kansas, Texas, California and the Indian Territory as well as Missouri, it maintained an enrollment of around two hundred and a reputation as a ‚Äúhighly superior small College.‚Äù Fees for the first year were set at $20 for the Collegiate Course, $15 for the Preparatory, and $80 for Room and Board. Additional costs included Music, $20; German, $10; Drawing, $10 and ‚ÄúWashing, per dozen, $.75.‚Äù A principal and six teachers were engaged who organized a regimen aimed at dispelling fears that ‚Äúhard mental labor‚Äù for girls would famish the resources of the body.‚Äù Rising at 5:30, students retired at 9:30 after a day characterized by thorough studies, suitable food and regular habits. Seven minutes of each class hour were devoted to exercise ‚Äì usually a brisk walk. Clothing was to be free of laces and corsets; calico dresses, aprons and sunbonnets ere required. Leaving campus and ‚Äúcompany ‚Äì keeping‚Äù ‚Äìtalking with young men ‚Äì were strictly forbidden. This routine was eased after a few years, with students welcoming a more reasonable and relaxed social environment. From the beginning brick buildings were planned for the campus. By 1875 Hardin Hall provided a comfortable ‚ÄúCollege Home‚Äù rivaled by none. A Chapel was soon built, followed by a Gymnasium, Science Building, Swimming Pool, Richardson Hall, and in 1925 Presser Hall, bringing evaluation of its physical properties to over $600,000. By 1931, however, poor business practices, unwise investments, and financial entanglements coincided with a nationwide depression that drastically lowered its enrollment, forcing trustees to close the College. Once called the ‚ÄúQueen of Western Female Schools,‚Äù Hardin was not without honor at home. Mexico's shops, schools, churches, homes and cultural pursuits had benefited greatly from its presence; residents deeply regretted its closing. They had long grown accustomed to the familiar wounds of piano students at practice, hockey games in progress, a bell ringing for dinner . . . and on warm spring evenings, drifting across a shady lawn, the songs ‚Äì and soft clear voices ‚Äì of the girls of Hardin Leta Hodge Audrain Historical Society Governed bay a Board of Trustees, Hardin benefited substantially from its founder, who initially donated nearly $40,000 and before his death had doubled that amount. It also benefited from the generosity of the people of Audrain County, who enthusiastically promoted the institution, subscribing $7,000 for its first new building and soon adding $8,000 to its endowment. John W. Million was president in 1900 and the previous presidents were A. W. Terrill, Priscilla Baird (Mrs. H. T. Baird), and A. K. Yancy. Oscar B. Smith was president from 1930 until Hardin closed in 1931. Along with seven other women's colleges in Missouri - Stephens, Christian, Lindenwood, Cottey, Howard Payne, William Woods, and Central Female College - Hardin College and Conservatory of Music was one of the original members of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for two-year colleges. Hardin was designated as the Alpha Chapter in 1918, though the chapter later moved to Stephens when it developed bachelor's degree programs. One of Hardin's buildings, Presser Hall, has been restored and is now known as Presser Arts Center. It sits on a 9-acre lot which also houses Richardson Hall and Hardin Gym.

He was born of rich and noble New Christian parents in Leiria, reading philosophy, poetry and writing of shepherds and shepherdesses by the rivers Liz and Lena. He studied at the University of Coimbra and took the degree of licentiate about 1600. He worked for the Duke of Vila Real, probably being his sons' teacher. He visited Lisbon from time to time, and tradition has it that he died by drowning on his way there. Though his first book, a little volume of verse (Romanceiro) published in 1596, and his last, a rhymed welcome to King Philip III, published in 1623, are written in Spanish he composed his eclogues and prose pastorals entirely in Portuguese, and thereby did a rare service to his country at a time when, owing to the Philippine Dynasty, Castilian was the language preferred by \\"polite society\\" and by men of letters. The characteristics of his prose style are harmony, purity and elegance, and he was one of Portugal's leading writers. A disciple of the Italian school, his verses were free from imitations of classical models. Their popularity may be seen by the fact that the Primavera went through seven editions in the 17th century and nine in all, a large number for so limited a market as that of Portugal. An edition of his collected works was published in one volume in Lisbon in 1723, and another in four volumes, but less complete, appeared there in 1774.

Situated in the neighborhood of Egmore, it is one of the four intercity railway terminals in the city and the other three railway stations are Chennai Central Railway Station, Tambaram railway station and Chennai Beach railway station. The station was built in 1906‚Äì1908 as the terminus of the South Indian Railway Company. The building built in Gothic style is one of the prominent landmarks of Chennai. The main entrance to the station is situated on Gandhi-Irwin Road and the rear entrance on Poonamallee High Road. The station was apparently constructed from 8679 on land purchased from Pulney Andy. The building is built in the Gothic style of architecture with imposing domes and corridors. It is one of the prominent landmarks of the city of Chennai. The recently opened northern entrance to this railway station is on the arterial Poonamallee High Road in Chennai city. History History says that the station was actually a fort, called the Egmore Redoubt, similar to Leith Castle, which is a part of Santhome. It is said that the station came up in a place that once used to store ammunition for the British. The station building was constructed on a land, for which was acquired from S. Pulney Andy, an English physician, who, in his letter to the 'Collector of Madras,' initially refused to sell his property owing to the difficulty with which he had purchased and developed the property. However, the South Indian Railway (SIR) Company, which was then operating train services to the south, persuaded him to sell the land, for which Andy claimed as compensation. After acquiring the land, the SIR invited Henry Irwin, CIE (chief engineer), who did much of latter day Indo-Saracenic in Madras, and E. C. Bird, company architect, to design a building to suit the traffic need. After several alterations in the plan, the construction work began in September 1905 and was completed in 1908. It was constructed by contractor T. Samynada Pillai of thirunageswaram near kumbakonnam at a cost of . The station was officially opened on 11 June 1908. There was initially a demand that the station be named after Robert Clive, which was, however, strongly opposed by the public as they wanted to name it Egmore. When the station was opened there was no electricity connection and a generator was used. The station became the major meter-gauge terminal for Chennai after the formation of Southern Railway in 1951 and served as the gateway to the southern Tamil Nadu, chiefly due to its acting as a connecting point for passengers from the south to the Chennai Central for boarding north-, west- and east-bound trains. Irwin and Bird worked on the design of the building, which was sympathetically added to in the 1930s and 1980s. In the 1990s it was converted into a major broad gauge terminal, a role in which it became operational in 1998. Earlier cars used to come inside the platform itself, which was found only in this station. In its report, the SIR commented on the construction of a new building for Egmore: SIR also claimed during the inauguration of the new building that it had given Madras a building to be proud of, \\"whose covered platform area is greater than that of Charing Cross Station in London.\\" The signal cabin at the station was opened in 1935, when the suburban line between Madras Beach and Tambaram was electrified. The signalling of the station is controlled by a Siemens all- electric power frame of 1935. A new suburban station building was opened in November 2004 when the Tambaram-Beach broad gauge section became fully operational. With increasing passenger traffic, the entrance on the Gandhi- Irwin Road eventually became insufficient. In 2004, construction of a second entry to the station on the Poonamallee High Road side began at a cost of . In June 2006, the second entrance was opened. Layout Chennai Egmore station lies between two flyovers separated by a distance of about , measuring on of land The station is about long and has 11 platforms. Platforms 1, 2 and 3 are on the eastern side. They are relatively short in length. They are used for short trains. Platform 4 is the main platform leading to the portico. Platforms 4, 5, 6 and 7 lie under the dome. These are used for long-distance trains. Platforms 10 and 11 are newly constructed ones that are handling broad-gauge electric multiple units (EMUs or suburban electric trains). Some platforms have escalators. Chennai Egmore station is not a junction. This can be understood also from its name. It has one line towards Chennai Beach railway station (via Park Town and Fort), while the other is towards Tambaram railway station (via Mambalam). Traffic As of 2013, the station handles about 35 main line trains and 118 suburban trains, and about 150,000 people daily. Its average daily earning is . The total revenue generated by the station during 2012-2013 was , making it the second highest revenue-generating station of the Southern Railway, behind Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station. Maintenance The illuminated station at night The station has been divided into two zones for mechanised cleaning contracts‚Äîplatforms 1 to 6 fall under zone I and platforms 7 to 11 fall under zone II. In December 2012, Southern Railway awarded contract to a new agency with a 43-member team taking charge of upkeep of zone II. Contracts for cleaning Chennai Egmore station has been awarded for a period of 3 years from 2010 for a value of . =Train care centre= The station has a train care centre named Egmore Railway Yard(GSN Yard - Gopal Samy Nagar), where the trains arriving at the station are prepared for departure. However, the centre is soiled and grimy due to lack of maintenance. Security The interior as viewed from a foot overbridge inside the station In April 2012, the Government Railway Police (GRP) and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) together launched a helpline known as Kaakum karangal (literally meaning 'Protecting hands') in the terminus. This involved dividing the terminus into three sectors and deploying 18 police personnel for security. The main station has CCTV cameras installed. The suburban platforms are covered by the Integrated Security Surveillance System (ISSS) project implemented in 2012. The project, implemented jointly by the Southern Railways and HCL Infosystems, includes installation of CCTV cameras that would record visuals around the clock and store the data for 30 days, with the footage transmitted and stored using an Internet Protocol system. Incidents On 22nd of March 2020, all trains were cancelled to from the station as Indian Railways announced the cancellation of all passenger services across the country up to 14th of April 2020 amid 2020 coronavirus lockdown in India. This was extended till the 3rd of May 2020 amid the extension of the lockdown. Future Second entrance to the station The station serves not only to the south but also to the north (Hyderabad) and east (Howrah). Additionally, the Chennai - Mumbai Dadar Central Express (west) originates from the Egmore station. As the growth potential at Chennai Egmore station is limited due to space constraint, the railway is planning to originate or terminate some of the additional trains to be introduced in future at Tambaram Railway Station. However, the station will remain a hub of train services and there is no proposal to shift all the services to Tambaram. In February 2013, as part of a national initiative to eliminate ballast tracks at major stations, washable aprons‚Äîballastless tracks or tracks on a concrete bed‚Äîwere laid along the entire length of track of platform 2 at the terminus. The station will also be connected to the Chennai Metro Rail Line 2, serving as an underground station. Legacy Though several changes were made to the station, the letters \\"SIR\\" emblazoned on its bas relief crest still remains, though the middle letter 'I' was painted out a few years ago to read \\"SR\\" (meaning Southern Railway).

He was the son of Juan Duque de Estrada, also a soldier of rank. He was orphaned very young, and educated by a cousin. While still young (a minor?) he was betrothed to his cousin's daughter. One night he found an intruder in the house, a gentleman with whom he was acquainted, and in a fit of jealousy killed both him and the young lady. The prevailing code of honor was considered a sufficient justification for Estrada's violence, but the law looked upon the act as a vulgar assassination, and he had to flee. After leading a vagabond life in the south of Spain, he was arrested at Ecija, was brought to Toledo, and tortured with extreme ferocity in order to extort a general confession as to his life during the past months. He had the strength not to yield to pain, and was finally able to escape from prison, partly by the help of a nun in a religious house, which faced the prison and partly by the intervention of friends. He made his way to Naples, where he entered the service of the Duke of Osuna, at that time viceroy. Duque de Estrada saw a good deal of fighting both with the Turks and the Venetians; he was employed by the viceroy in the conspiracy against Venice as one of the disguised Spanish soldiers, sent into the town to destroy the arsenal but who were warned in time that the conspiracy had been betrayed, and therefore escaped. After the fall of his patron, Duque de Estrada resumed his vagabond life, served under Bethlen Gabor in Transylvania, and in the Thirty Years' War. In 1633, he entered the order of San Juan de Dios, and died at some time after 1637 (1647?) in Sardinia, where he is known to have taken part in the defence of the island against an attack by the French.

They were written at different times, and parts have been lost. His style is inaccurate and inexact, and it would be unsafe to trust his memoirs in every detail, but they are amazingly vivid, and contain a wonderful picture of the moral and intellectual state of a large part of Spanish society at the time.

Origin  Horst Castle at Blumenthal, seat of the Blumenthal family from the 13th century until 1810 Quackenburg, seat of a major branch of the Blumenthal family from the early 18th century onwards Like the von Grabow family, whose descendants have included Pushkin, the Blumenthals were originally a branch of the Ammendorf (or Amendorf ) family, who inherited the estates of Blumenthal and Grabow from the only daughter and heiress of Nikolaus von Blumenthal, first referred to in a document of 1240. His family probably originally came from Bloemendaal in Holland and re-located first to Blumenthal near Verden in the diocese of Bremen and thence to Blumenthal in the Archdiocese of Magdeburg, where they were vassals of the Wendish Counts of Plotho, naming each settlement after the previous one. The Plotho family expanded its estates in the Prignitz in the 13th century, bringing Nikolaus von Blumenthal with them. There he named the villages of Blumenthal and Grabow after his properties in the Archdiocese of Magdeburg. The family of his son-in-law, Ruthger von Amendorf, had also come from the country around Bremen. They inherited Nikolaus von Blumenthal's estates and took his name. The castle of Horst, near Blumenthal in the Prignitz, was the family seat for over 600 years, until 1810. The family also claimed a legendary descent from the Roman Emperor Florianus, as well as from the Arthurian knights Garel and Daniel von Blumenthal, whose stories are told in 13th-century poems by Der Pleier and Der Stricker, respectively.  Martial and political history  Horst Chapel, erected after the destruction of the original chapel during the Thirty Years' War The family had a strong military tradition. Twenty of its members died in battle, including one leading a cavalry charge at Blenheim; eleven fought at the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz alone, and of eighteen who served in the Franco-Prussian War eleven fought at the Battle of Gravelotte. Nineteen served in the First World War. Three of its members won the Pour le M√©rite (Blue Max), two received the Order of the Black Eagle, one became a field-marshal and six became generals, besides numerous family members who were regimental colonels. The family also produced three Prussian ministers of war, one leading statesman under King J√©rome of Westphalia (a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur), Danzig's longest-serving governor and a prominent 19th-century Bavarian politician opposed to rising anti-semitism. One member of the family became a head of state (Georg, Prince- Bishop of Ratzeburg, see below).  Prominent members  * Ruthger von Ammendorf (whose nephew became Ruthger von Blumenthal-Amendorf and later Ruthger von Blumenthal), Bishop of Brandenburg 1241‚Äì51 * Otto (II) Magistrate in 1420, a bulwark of Frederick Count of Zollern against the Wendish nobility of the Brandenburg Mark. * Otto (III) son of the above, Captain of the Prignitz 1415‚Äì22; Castellan of Lenzen 1420‚Äì22 * Hans (II), son of Otto (III), Vogt of Arneburg 1440‚Äì50 * Georg (I) (1490‚Äì1550), the last Catholic sovereign ruler in northern Germany, and the only Bishop in Brandenburg during the Protestant Reformation to die a Catholic. * Joachim Friedrich (I) (1609‚Äì1657), diplomat and politician of Brandenburg-Prussia * Heinrich (V) (died 1693), the most recent common ancestor of all living members of the family, fought at the Battle of Fleurus in Derfflinger's Foot (Stayn's Brigade) and was addressed by the Elector Frederick III (the future King in Prussia) as \\"Obristwachtmeister usw. Baron von Blumenthal\\" (roughly, \\"Major, etc., Baron von Blumenthal) * Christoph Caspar, Brandenburg's Ambassador to France, was the son of Joachim Friedrich. He negotiated the Peace of Oliva. He narrowly lost to Count Schwarzenberg the election to the Grand Mastership of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg). His son * Ludwig (I) (1666‚Äì1704) became a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701, was a chamberlain to Frederick I King of Prussia and was Colonel of the Prussian Life Dragoons, at whose head he was killed in a charge up the slope to Oberglau at the Battle of Blenheim; the regiment lost 300 men. He married Sophie Wilhelmina von Sch√∂ning, daughter of the Field Marshal and War Minister Hans Adam von Sch√∂ning. * Ludwig (II) (died 1760) was President of Frederick the Great's principal ministry, the War and Domains Directory. He was succeeded by his nephew. * Ludwig (II)'s sons Friedrich (died 1745) and Hans (1722‚Äì1788) both commanded Frederick the Great's famous Gardes du Corps, which Friedrich had founded. Hans won the Pour le M√©rite at Hohenfriedberg. He had to leave the army after being wounded leading his regiment in a successful cavalry charge at the Battle of Lobositz. In 1786 he was made a Count, together with his cousin Joachim (VIII) and supervised the education of Frederick William III's brother, Prince Henry. * Their brother Henrich (VII), a major in Prinz Heinrich's Regiment, was killed in action at Ostritz in 1756. His gallant defence was reported in the local press and his friend the poet von Kleist wrote his epitaph. * Georg (IV) (born at Quackenburg, Pomerania, in 1722, died 1784) won the Pour le M√©rite at the Battle of Prague. In March 1760 his defensive action against a surprise attack at Neustadt caught the attention of the British press. He was charged with raising forces to oppose the invasion of Pomerania in the 1760s by the Russians, who put a price on his head. He became a major general. His nephew * Werner (I) (1725‚Äì1824) and his son Werner (III) (1766‚Äì1832) both commanded the dragoon regiment known as the Porzellaner * Ludwig (V) (1774-1813), brother of Werner (III), fought at Jena and Eylau and was mortally wounded leading the 2nd Squadron of the Brandenburg Dragoons in Th√ºmen's Brigade at Dennewitz. * Joachim (VIII) Christian (1720‚Äì1800) Prussian Minister of War and Finance, was made a count together with his cousin Hans, by an unusual double-patent. * Ludwig (I)'s daughter Countess Charlotte (1701‚Äì1761 (married to General Alexander von D√∂nhoff), Count Heinrich (VII)'s widow Marie Th√©r√®se, n√©e d'Harscamp(1712‚Äì82) and Friedrich (V)'s widow Leopoldine, the biographer of Zieten, were all chief ladies-in-waiting to Princess Henry, sister-in-law of Frederick the Great. A sculpture of Marie Th√©r√®se by Jean-Pierre-Antoine Tassaert was destroyed by allied bombing. Count Heinrich (VIII) von Blumenthal, 1765‚Äì1830, Mayor of Magdeburg, politician and courtier under King J√©rome of Westphalia * Count Heinrich (VIII) (1765‚Äì1830), the last Blumenthal to occupy the family seat at Horst bei Blumenthal, was Mayor of Magdeburg (where his statue is to be seen) and Head Chamberlain to J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, as well as governor of Jer√¥me's palace at Wilhelmsh√∂he. * Count Albert (1797‚Äì1860) commanded the Prussian First Foot Guards from 1851 to 1856 and retired as a lieutenant-general * Robert was Regierungspresident (Governor) of Danzig from 1841 to 1863 and of Sigmaringen from 1864 to 1873. He was a leading opponent of Roman Catholicism in Prussia. * Leonhard (I) (1810‚Äì1900), field marshal and leading general of the German wars of unification * Albrecht (IV) (1842‚Äì1918), son of Leonhard, who published his father's memoirs, became a lieutenant general. * Louis (Ludwig (VII)) (1811‚Äì1903), brother of Leonhard, led the Prussian 52nd Infantry as Colonel into its decisive charge on the Austrian Hoch- und Deutschmeister Regiment at the Battle of Nachod in 1866. He became a major-general. * Maximilian (I) (1823‚Äì1914), was a major in the 1st East Prussian Grenadiers No. 1 during the Austro-Prussian War, in which he won the Order of the Red Eagle (Fourth Class). In 1870 he commanded a battalion of the 73rd Fusiliers and won the Iron Cross (Second Class) at Gravelotte, having led his battalion through the murderous crossfire of the Mance Ravine and stood firm while being bombarded by the artillery of both sides. After the war he commanded the 1st Silesian Grenadier Regiment No. 10. He retired as a major general. * Count Werner von Blumenthal-Suckow (1815‚Äì1883), was a Member of Parliament of the North German Confederation and also of the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus * Count Werner (V) von Blumenthal-Suckow (1848‚Äì1928), a veteran of the Austro- and Franco-Prussian wars, and a friend of Prince Frederick von Hohenzollern of Prussia, became Chamberlain to the King of Saxony. He was a leading moderate in the Conservative Party, and at the Tivoli Congress of 1892, at which Klasing persuaded the party to adopt anti-semitism as part of its programme, he spoke out courageously. He was shouted down, and those who supported him did not dare do so publicly. His daughter Maria, a nun, was murdered in her 70s by the SS. * Gustav (died 1913, buried at Lindi, Tanzania) commanded one of three columns in the campaign which ended the Maji-Maji wars in German East Africa. * Hans (XI) (1855‚Äì1945), youngest son of Ludwig (VII), lost his two elder brothers in the Franco-Prussian War. Most of his adult life was uneventful. He was colonel of the 13th Hussars in 1900; Commander of the 24th cavalry Brigade (13th Hussars and 9th Dragoons) stationed in Metz in 1906, and promoted to major general, but after quarrelling with his commanding officer, General Maximilian von Prittwitz, he left the army in 1910 as a lieutenant general. However, on the outbreak of the First World War he rejoined the army and first commanded the 60th Landwehr Brigade, then the 49th in Bois de Lord, south of the Champagne, until 1917, when health forced him to retire again. He was made a Count of the Grand Duchy of Baden, and married Lillian Steinway-Oakes (1860‚Äì1904), daughter of the celebrated co-founder of Steinway & Sons, Henry Steinway, and sister-in-law of Baden's minister of the interior, Baron Heinrich von Bodman. His end was tragic. His son Curt joined the SA and rose to be Reiterstandartenf√ºhrer (equivalent to a major general) in command of the 27th SA Reiterstandarte at Kyritz. On the night of May 1, 1945, Curt shot his wife, children and himself in front of his father and sister Clarissa. Shortly after that, the Russians arrived and attempted to rape the 65-year-old Clarissa. Hans, himself over ninety, drove (or shamed) them off. But the experience was a shock and he died of a heart attack a few days later on 7 May. * Clarissa (1881‚Äì1971) mentioned above, made a career for herself during the 1930s as an impressionist painter in Florence and Rome. She was a Roman Catholic convert. A portion of those years are mentioned in the Memoir, \\"Artemis Smith's ODD GIRL Revisited\\" by Annselm Artemis Smith Morpurgo, daughter of Scandinavian Expressionist Painter and Sculptor Vilna Jorgen Morpurgo. Vilna resided and studied with Clarissa in Rome at Clarissa's studio on via Marghutta. As late as 1962, a gallery on via Marghutta is known to have still exhibited Clarissa's work. Both Clarissa and Vilna participated in a noted 1938 Group Show of Foreign Women Artists, which also included Elaine De Kooning, at another neighboring gallery on via Flamminia. Clarissa notably also painted a portrait of Vilna in 1933, taken to the US in 1940 by a branch of the Italian-Jewish Morpurgo Baronial Family and only recently (since 2009) placed on charity auction by The Savant Garde Institute. Additional history related to that obscure impressionist masterpiece may be found at the Vilna Jorgen Morpurgo webpage.http://vilnajorgen.tripod.com/VilnaBio.html Clarissa's technique is unmistakable although she may often have left her work unsigned. There are probably many other of her paintings that will eventually surface. She was also an accomplished Vatican restorer and probably, according to colleague Vilna Jorgen Morpurgo, also secretly a fine arts forger for the Vatican. Both Vilna and Clarissa were included in the elite artistic social circle surrounding Mussolini and Hitler in the 1930s, but it is also very likely, from Vilna's account, that Clarissa is one of the unsung heroines of the German aristocracy who secretly opposed and worked against Mussolini's alliance with Hitler and helped Vilna and her Italian-Jewish Family escape to the US in 1940. * Albrecht (1889‚Äì1945) was a respected philologist, a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, and as a poet was a leading member of the circle of Stefan George, to whom he introduced the Stauffenberg brothers. The dissident Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer conducted an illegal seminary in 1938 from Albrecht's estate at Gro√ü Schl√∂nwitz. In 1940, he joined the NSDAP. In 1945, faced with the advancing American troops and the defeat of Nazi Germany, he and his wife committed suicide in Marburg. * Wolf-Werner von Blumenthal, brother of Albrecht, was chairman of the family firm of Bachmann-von Blumenthal,Bachmann-von Blumenthal which manufactured fighter aircraft during the Second World War. His diary of the last days of the war survives. * Count Hans-J√ºrgen (1907‚Äì1944), officer who took part in Oster's 1938 conspiracy and was executed after the July 20 Plot against Adolf Hitler in 1944. * Wulf von Blumenthal served on the Eastern Front and pursued a military career in the post-war Bundeswehr, rising to the rank of Colonel commanding the 32nd Panzer Grenadier Battalion. * Werner Richard and Wolfgang Charles, Albrecht's sons, were both educated at Oxford. They ceased using their first Christian name and adopted their stepfather's surname, becoming, respectively, Richard and Charles Arnold-Baker, joined the British army and both served as officers in MI6. Richard (called Captain Barnes in the transcripts) was in the team of officers who interrogated Rudolf Hess, and Charles commanded Winston Churchill's bodyguard for part of the war, and in Norway arrested the Deputy Commandant of Auschwitz, Karl Fritzsch. Charles was one of the earliest officers of MI6 to voice suspicions about the traitor Kim Philby. He was the Senior Barrister of the Inner Temple (his ashes are interred in the triforium of the Temple Church) and author of The Companion to British History. * James Arnold-Baker (1944-2018), son of Werner Richard, read Geology at Oxford. He was CEO of BBC Enterprises from 1986 to 1994 and then became Secretary to the Delegates (Chief Executive) of Oxford University Press. * Henry only son of Wolfgang Charles, read Theology at Oxford and is Deputy Dean of the EIB Institute. He is the editor and publisher of his father's magnum opus, The Companion to British History, and himself the author of a book of short stories. * Ulrich formerly head of the United Nations Legal Department * Julia (born 1970), Professor of Political Science at the Humboldt University, Berlin; from 2018, President of the Viadrina. * Raphael Actor, Comedian and playwright http://www.raphaelvonb.com/about/ All living members of the family are descended from Eustachius von Blumenthal and Margarethe Gans zu Puttlitz (married circa 1575). She was a descendant, via the families of Gleichen zu Tonna and Querfurt from Henry I the Child, Landgrave of Hesse, and thus also of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, St Ludwig of Thuringia (\\"Ludwig the Holy\\"), St. Hedwig of Silesia and Charlemagne, besides St. Olga of Pleskau, St. Vladimir of Kiev, St. Ludmilla of Bohemia, St. Olaf of Norway and St. Matilda von Ringelsheim.

Elmhurst High School was a part of the Fort Wayne Community Schools school district, serving those living in the Waynedale area of Fort Wayne. It received accreditation from the Indiana Department of Education and the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Closing Elmhurst High School On March 22, 2010, a vote was taken by the FWCS School Board to accept a recommendation of the FWCS administration regarding ways to reduce the 2010 district budget by $15 million. The administration's report included the step of closing Elmhurst High School. The budget moves were required because current economic conditions reduced federal and state funds available to the school district. The closing of Elmhurst has been a highly debated topic over the past several years, and the Board, by a unanimous vote of 7-0, agreed to accept the administration's recommendation. With that action, the 2009/10 school year was the final year of operations for the school. Returning students were reallocated to other high schools in the FWCS system.  Mission  The mission of Elmhurst High School was to guarantee that all students were prepared to meet or exceed Indiana Standards by narrowing the achievement gap, by increasing the successful completion of advanced courses, and by improving student achievement.  History  Dating back to 1929, Elmhurst High School had nine principals, including three female principals. In 1979, Elmhurst High School underwent drastic renovations in order to better serve its students. The renovations were very costly and took a long time to complete but when they were finally finished, Elmhurst was equipped with an auxiliary gym and 600 seat auditorium. The auditorium was designed to double as a movie theater, with the use of a 20'x20' retractable movie screen to be installed after the construction of the auditorium. The school has also had a rich tradition of musicians. Annually, the school hosted an ISSMA Jazz Fest. Back in the era of jazz, there were many big names who came to perform at Elmhurst. Among them were: Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Maynard Ferguson, and many others. The school also had many college bands perform there as well. Along the band room wall, you could see various posters dating back to when the tickets were on sale. Sports and clubs Elmhurst's athletic department consisted of more than 20 IHSAAIndiana High School Athletic Association, www.ihsaa.org sports including the following for both boys and girls: cross-country, soccer, tennis, basketball, marching band, track and field, swim and dive, bowling, and golf. Football, wrestling, and baseball were also offered for boys, while softball, volleyball, gymnastics, and cheerleading were offered for girls. All sanctioned sports competed in the Summit Athletic Conference. In its final year, the Elmhurst Boys' Basketball team won the 3A Regional title. In 2010 the Elmhurst robotics team won both the state and world championships competing against students from Countries including Canada, Korea, and China. On March 7, 2009, the Elmhurst Girls' Basketball team brought home the first state championship for any team sport in the school's history, defeating Owen Valley 62-59 to win the Class 3A title. On August 21, 2009, the football team won their first game since the '04 campaign under head coach Kyle Beauchamp in their final year before shutting their doors- defeating Ft.

In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip, Life's Little Comedies, which evolved into the rural-centred humorous Birdseye in 1923. He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947, but as the Star kept publication rights to Birdseye Center, Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations. Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise's sudden death from a heart attack in 1948, and it went on to become the longest-running strip in English-Canadian comics history. Life and career James Llewellyn Frise was born 16 October 1891 near Fingerboard in Scugog Island, Ontario. He was the only son of John Frise (d. 1922), who was a farmer, and Hannah Barker (d. 1933), who had immigrated with her family from England to Port Perry when she was two. He grew up in Seagrave and Myrtle and went to school in Port Perry. There he struggled with spelling‚Äîeven with his own middle name‚Äîand developed an obsession with drawing. Throughout his teens, friends and teachers encouraged Frise to move to Toronto to pursue a drawing career. In 1910 he moved there, though without aiming to develop his art‚Äîrather he sought work and found it as an engraver and printer at the Rolph, Clark, Stone lithography firm; he spent six months drawing maps for the Canadian Pacific Railway company indicating lots for sale in Saskatchewan. Frise's first published cartoon, Star Weekly, 12 November 1910 While seeking another job he read in the Toronto Star an exchange between a farmer and an editor in which the editor extolled the virtues of farm life only to have the farmer rebut him and challenge him to try out farming. Frise drew a cartoon of the editor struggling to milk a cow and a farmer as an editor; he submitted it to the Star, where it appeared in the Star Weekly supplement on that 12 November. He visited the Stars offices the following Monday and the Editor-in-Chief hired him immediately. He began by lettering titles and touching up photos until the Star Weeklys editor J. Herbert Cranston enlisted him for his drawing skills. Frise illustrated news stories and the children's feature The Old Mother Nature Club, and did political cartoons. His cartoons also appeared in publications such as the Owen Sound Sun. Frise took a job at an engraving firm in Montreal in 1916 and in the midst of World War I enlisted in the military that 17 May. He had had two years previous experience with the 48th Highlanders of Canada and served at first served in the 69th Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery. He was deployed overseas that September and by November was serving in the 12th Battery at the front, where he employed his farm experience driving horses to move artillery and ammunition. At the Battle of Vimy Ridge his left hand was severely injured when an enemy shell exploded at an ammunition dump where he was delivering loads of shells. The Star reported its anxiety over the possible loss of \\"one of Canada‚Äôs most promising cartoonists\\", but his drawing hand‚Äîhis right‚Äîwas uninjured. He was discharged after recuperating in Chelmsford, England, and arrived back in Toronto on 1 December 1917 and returned to work, first at the Star and shortly after at the Star Weekly again. Frise illustration from Battery Action! (1919) by Hugh R. Kay, George Magee, and F. A. MacLennan Canadian Field Artillery's 43rd Battery approached Frise in 1919 to illustrate a book on the history of their unit. The volume appeared later in the year under the title Battery Action!, written by Hugh R. Kay, George Magee, and F. A. MacLennan and illustrated with Frise's light-hearted, humorous cartoons rendered in accurate detail. As the Star Weeklys circulation grew, so did its comics section. Cranston encouraged Frise to create a Canada-themed comic strip in the vein of W.E. Hill's Among Us Mortals, a Chicago strip which also ran in the Star. Frise protested he could not keep up with a weekly schedule but nonetheless began At the Rink, which d√©buted 25 January 1919; it became Life's Little Comedies on 15 March. The strip proved popular and evolved by 1923; it had taken on the influence of John T. McCutcheon's depictions of a fictional rural town in the American Midwest called Bird Center. Frise turned his focus to humorous and nostalgic depictions of rural life and on 12 December 1925 renamed his strip Birdseye Center, whose setting he described as \\"any Canadian village\\"; its lead characters included bowler-hatted Pigskin Peters, Old Archie and his pet moose Foghorn, and lazy Eli Doolittle and his wife Ruby. The strip grew in popularity and in 1926 was voted favourite comic strip in a readers' poll‚Äîas a write-in, since the strip did not appear in the list of options. Birdseye Center 02.jpgalt=A comic strip Birdseye Center 05.jpgalt=A comic strip Birdseye Center 06.jpgalt=A comic strip From about 1920 Frise shared an office with the journalist and Vimy ridge veteran Greg Clark (1892‚Äì77). They became friends, and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark's tales in the Star of the pair's misadventures in Toronto‚ÄîFrise tall and gangly, and Clark short and stout. A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: \\"We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade me to get a steam shovel to do my spring digging and ruined my garden. Perhaps this book is our most foolish adventure.\\" Frise chatted with the frequent visitors to the office. He worked at his own pace and often tore up work-in-progress in dissatisfaction and submitted his strips at the last moment. Frise's tardiness caused such delays in production and distribution that editorial director Harry C. Hindmarsh once demanded Joseph E. Atkinson have something done about it. Atkinson replied, \\"Harry, The Star Weekly does not go to press without Mr. Frise.\\" Licensing included the Birdseye Center Cabin Park on Lake Scugog. Frise was unconcerned with the resale value of his original artwork and pursued little licensing of his work, amongst which included product endorsements, products such as jigsaw puzzles, and a Birdseye Center Cabin Park on Lake Scugog, opened in 1940. His work provided him well enough that he bought a home in the well-to-do Baby Point neighbourhood. Frise and Clark had grown concerned with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, as well as the opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, \\"Aren't you going to give us a chance to bid?\\" Frise told him, \\"Mr Hindmarsh, you have nothing to bid with.\\" The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947. The Star maintained publication rights to Birdseye Center, so Frise re-created the feature as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations. It d√©but 22 February 1947, and the Standard ran it in colour, as Frise had long wanted. Standards circulation grew after the addition of Frise and Clark's collaborations. Frise provided the illustrations to Jack Hambleton's cookbook Skillet Skills for Camp and Cottage published in 1947. After feeling unwell the night before, Frise died of a heart attack in his home in Toronto on 13 June 1948, at age 57. Clark telephoned Cranston on hearing the news, saying, \\"A great gentleman has passed on.\\" Frise was buried at Prospect Cemetery in Toronto.

He enjoyed the outdoors and pursued fishing and hunting. He often returned to the Lake Scugog area and sometimes spoke about his career there. He was a Methodist Christian. After returning from his service in World War I, Frise began courting Ruth Elizabeth Gate, who had been born in the US and grew up in Toronto. She worked at an advertising agency, and co-published with her father a magazine in braille and a braille bible. She married Frise on 21 February 1918 and the couple had four daughters, Jean, Ruth, Edythe, and Betty; and a son, John. Frise often featured his spaniel Rusty in his strips. Legacy The Montreal cartoonist Doug Wright (1917‚Äì83) took the reins of Juniper Junction, which went on to become English Canada's longest-running comic strip. In 1965 the Canadian publisher McClelland & Stewart printed a treasury of Birdseye Center with commentary by Greg Clark and an introduction by Gordon Sinclair. Clark continued publishing his tales for a time with illustrations by Duncan Macpherson (1924‚Äì93), but soon moved on to different topics. Scugog Shores Museum in Port Perry holds some samples of Frise's original artwork, and the Province of Ontario erected an Ontario Historical Plaque in front of the museum to commemorate Frise's role in Ontario's heritage. In 2009, Frise was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame.

The company is based in Kyoto and has annual profits of close to ¬•100 billion on over ¬•2 trillion worth of loans (2005). The company had to restructure its debt after failing to make a loan payment. History Aiful was established in April 1967 by Yoshitaka Fukuda as a sole-proprietorship. In 1978, this small company was reformed in Kyoto as Marutaka, Inc. and opened its first four branches to expand its consumer-finance business. The company continued to grow over the next five years and it acquired three small companies in the same business segment and renamed itself Aiful in 1983. These mergers gave the company over ¬•90 million in capital and a growing market share in the consumer loan sector. Soon afterward, the company began to offer home-equity and small business loans. During the 1980s and up to the present day, the company has continued to expand by finding new investment opportunities, particularly real estate, engaging in mergers to increase its market share. Today the company offers a wide range of consumer financial services, ranging from issuing credit cards to providing home equity loans. Additionally, the company provides small business loans and until recently operated a chain of karaoke parlors and Taiwanese-style restaurants. The company has 912 branches (many of them automated teller machines) throughout Japan and currently employs over 2000 people. Criticism The company has many techniques to promote repayment that some have viewed as unscrupulous, but have resulted in a low default rate for the bank. Additionally, the company has been charged by some individuals with exploiting the financial problems of some consumers by offering high-rate loans that must be secured by collateral, often the individual's real estate. This may lead to loss of a consumer's home and has led to allegations that the company is a sarakin or a loan shark. Several advocacy groups have been formed for those who feel victimized by such practices. In 2006 regulators in Japan ruled against the lending practices of the consumer finance sector and revised the maximum legal lending rate to 18.75% (down from a previous legal limit of 29%). Furthermore, this ruling enabled consumers to claim back the interest they have been overcharged from companies like Aiful for a period of up to 10 years back, which forces them to make high provisions for these reimbursements on their balancesheet. On April 14, 2006, the FSA issued a business suspension order that forced Aiful to shut down domestic operations for three business days and in some areas up to 25 days. Advertising In contrast with the more staid image of the more traditional banks, Aiful and other consumer finance companies attempt to have a livelier image. For example, the signs and logos of Aiful and its subsidiaries are often very colorful and eye-catching, seeking to draw passersby into loan outlets. Recent advertisement campaigns have featured Chihuahua TV ads and special loans marketed towards women. Additionally, Aiful and other consumer finance companies often distribute packages of tissues at mass transit stations. External links *Aiful Corp. (in Japanese) *Aiful Corp.

Deering Oaks is a public park in Portland, Maine, which has a baseball diamond, tennis courts, a playground, and a pond. It is located west of downtown Portland and is bordered by Deering Avenue on the west, Forest Avenue on the east, Park Avenue to the south and Interstate 295 to the north. State Street bisects the park. Access is from State Street, Deering Avenue, or Park Avenue. The Portland Farmers Market is located on the Park Avenue side of the park. The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History December, 1879, map of the park During King William's War, Benjamin Church helped defend the British settlers on this site in September 1689 against Canadiens, and tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy. The city had for some time been interested the Deering Oaks property, part of a larger estate owned by the Deering family since the early 19th century. In 1875, the Deerings offered the city of land in exchange for a tax abatement, and the city agreed to the deal in 1879. The park was developed by William Goodwin, the city's civil engineer, as part of an overall master plan for city parks developed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Goodwin's vision largely survives today, except only for the loss of a small portion of the park's north side, for the construction of Interstate 295. Deering Oaks Pond at one time filled and drained with the ocean tides; it was naturally connected to Back Cove until altered to suit roadways in the late 19th century. Deering Oaks also hosts the city's monument to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, a casting of The Hiker by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson. During the winter, one can ice skate on the frozen pond, and until the late 1990s, paddle boats could be rented during the summer season to explore the confines of the pond and enjoy the scenery.

The plan called for the closing of State Street where it bisects the park and the restoration of the original entrance at State St. and Park Avenue. As of 2004, the city had spent $3 million over 10 years on the park, including the building of a children's wading pool, the conversion of the Bowling Green Road to a pedestrian walkway and improvements to the sports facilities, including the tennis courts.Deering Oaks 'castle' restoration slated Bangor Daily News, December 17, 2004 =Bridge over Deering Oaks Ravine= An arched footbridge, measuring 40 feet in length, was built in 1911 spanning the Deering Oaks ravine. It cost the city $3,355. Portland also built 8-foot tall lamps on both sides of the bridge made of glass. It replaced a wooden bridge. In 2007, an engineering firm commissioned by the city estimated that cleaning, coating and repairing the bridge would cost $216,000.

A Portland resident wrote that the Associated Press had reported at the time that 150 crew members cordoned off a portion of the park from the public for four days, and about 140 local people were plucked from an auditioning crowd of 6,000 to play extras in the scene‚Äîdoing things in the background to make it look like a typical urban Christmas in a park: skating, walking, snowball fights, etc. In 2010, Portland received a federal grant worth $1.2 million to line the bottom of Deering Oaks Pond, with a local match of $540,000. The project was designed to promote water quality, which was harmed by algae blooms in the summer due to organic material settling on the bottom of the pond as well as prevent structural damage.\\"Deering Oaks Pond prepped for $1.2 million upgrade\\" Portland Daily Sun, December 24, 2010 Construction has begun on lining the bottom of the pond with cement. By covering the wetland soils this pond will no longer be spring fed; it will not sustain plant life and the ducks who live here will need to rely heavily on food from humans to survive, as their natural food supply will be cut off. It is not known whether cattails and other breeding habitat components will be restored as part of this project.

The school is part of the Portland Public Schools district. It is one of the three public high schools located in Portland, the others being Portland High School and Casco Bay High School. History Deering High School was established in 1874 after Deering, Maine, seceded from Westbrook, Maine, in 1871. It is named after the town of Deering, which was later annexed by the City of Portland in 1898. The first Deering High School building eventually became Longfellow Elementary. The second building was completed in 1889. It burned down in 1921, but was saved and converted into Lincoln Middle School in 1923. The first session opened in Morgen's hall, a one-room wooden structure, at Morrill's Corner, in the fall of 1874 with 31 students attending. Before the end of the year, the high school moved to the Heseltine Grammar School on Ocean Avenue where it remanded for four years; crowded conditions existed at Heselton. Five students graduated in the first class. There were two sessions daily and, as late as 1895, school was held six days a week. The courses were similar to those of our present Algebra and Latin. However, a student had no choice in subjects, but was compelled to take all those offered in order to be graduate. In 1878, Deering moved to the old wooden Longfellow School which was located opposite from Central Square Baptist Church. Seventy students were enrolled; however, the school was so large that the ground floor was used by the student body. Mr. F. E. C. Robbins was principal. In 1887, two new courses were re-organized and renamed the Commercial Department. The first edition of the school newspaper, The Breccia was published in 1887. In 1889, Deering became part of the City of Portland. When the Enabling Act was before legislature, Fred Matthews, a graduate of Deering who was then practicing law in the city, included in the act a provision for the \\"continuing\\" maintenance always of a high school in Deering of equal grade and standing. This led to Portland having two high schools. By 1897, with Mr. E. H. Crosby as principal, the school had grown so plans were made for a new building which was to have fourteen recitation rooms, a library and a large assembly hall. Loud and long were the protestations that such a building was a wicked waste of money since four classrooms would do nicely - and why a library? In 1889, however, work was started on the construction of the main building of what is now known as Lincoln Middle School. Just before the building was to be occupied, Mr. Crosby, Principal, was killed by a train at \\"Woodfords Crossing\\" during a rain storm. His term was completed by Mr. Swan and Mr. Hill. In 1898, on January 30, the new Deering High School was opened with Principal William H. Marvin in charge. The Assembly Hall, which was located on the third floor, was dedicated to Mr. Crosby and remained in his name until the hall was renovated into a library. From 1902-1909, John M. Nicholas served as principal; from 1909-1913, Herbert I. Allen was the principal; and from 1913-1919, Louis B. Farnham, was chief administrator of Deering. Yet only fourteen years after 1898, the school has grown so that an addition, the Annex of Lincoln Junior High was built. In this building, the school's disaster occurred, the fire of May 1921. The library and classrooms in the main building were entirely destroyed. For the remainder of the year, classes were held in the Annex and in two local churches. Under the administration of William E. Wing, principal of Deering from 1919 until 1942, the present Deering was built and enlarged. In 1922, the main building was constructed and housed 826 students, and in 1932 a small wing was added to complete the structure. The athletic field was laid out and many extra curricular activities were started. The school newspaper was named The Purple Line in 1929 and changed to the present name Ramblings in 1940. Carlton Wiggin was head of Deering through the years of World War II. In the fall of 1960 Deering became a three year high school for the first time. Freshmen were scheduled at the four-hour schedule in junior high schools. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors occupied the Stevens Avenue School in which many improvements had been made during the summer. The school day was extended from 1:05 P.M. to 2:10 P.M., and included seven periods - each forty-five minutes long. In the fall of 1979 Deering became once again a four-year school. Mr. Wiggin retired in 1967 and was succeeded by Donald G. Hale. During the 1976 school year, The Deering High School Study Committee was formed to assess the physical plan and program offerings. During the 1978 school year, a DHS Building Committee with architectural firm Wadsworth, Boston, Dimick, Mercer & Weatherill began designing the new addition. Plans were presented to the State Board of Education on July 9, 1980, and then to referendum on September 23, 1980, which passed. Construction of the new addition began in the summer of 1981 when David Wallace became the new principal of Deering High School. Mr. Hale continued on the stuff as the Building Project Coordinator. With the 1982-83 school year, students and staff utilized all newly constructed and renovated areas of Deering High School. Included in first group of the high schools recognized nationally, Deering was named a National School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education in 1983. In 1985, Paul A. Pendleton became the Principal of Deering High School. Under his leadership the provisions of Maine's Educational Reform Act were implemented, and ten years NEASC re-accreditation was awarded. The Portland School Committee confirmed Jan C. Patton as principal in July 1992. Patton served 3 years. The challenge of her tenure was the successful planning for and adoption of block scheduling. Curriculum Deering was one of 34 high schools nationally which had joined the International Studies School Network, which is part of the Asia Society. The school later chose to not renew it's ISSN membership due to fees. In October 2013, Deering High School announced it would offer an Arabic language course as part of their new international curriculum. It was believed to be the first Arabic language course in Maine public schools. Sports Memorial Stadium is located on Ludlow Street near Deering High School, it is an artificial turf surface and is the home field for DHS outdoor sports teams.

The same sources say that Drago»ô came from Maramure≈ü while chasing an aurochs or bison across the Carpathian Mountains. His descƒÉlecat, or \\"dismounting\\", on the banks of the Moldova River has traditionally been regarded as the symbol of the foundation of the Principality of Moldavia in Romanian historiography. Most details of his life are uncertain. Historians have identified him either with Drago»ô of Bedeu or with Drago»ô of Giule»ôti, who were Vlach, or Romanian, landowners in the Kingdom of Hungary. Most Moldavian chronicles write that Drago»ô came to Moldavia in 1359, but modern historians tend to propose an earlier date (1345, 1347, and 1352). Drago»ô became the head of a march of the Kingdom of Hungary, which emerged after a Hungarian army inflicted a crushing defeat on a large army of the Golden Horde in 1345. Early sources say that he founded Baia and Siret, and invited Saxon settlers who introduced viticulture in Moldavia. According to the traditional dating, he died in 1361, but earlier years (1353, 1354 and 1357) have also been suggested by historians. Drago»ô did not establish a royal dynasty, because his grandson, Balc, was expelled from Moldavia by Bogdan of Cuhea, another Vlach landowner from Maramure≈ü.  Origins  The early 16th-century Moldo-Russian Chronicle, which contains the most detailed description of the foundation of Moldavia, described Drago»ô as one of the \\"Romans\\" who had received estates in Maramure»ô from \\"King Vladislav of Hungary\\". According to the chronicle, the king invited the \\"Romans\\" to fight against the Tatars and settled them in Maramure»ô after their victory over the invaders. Modern historians' attempts to determine Drago»ô's family connections and to describe his early life have not produced a broad consensus. According to a scholarly theory, he was identical with Drago»ô of Bedeu, mentioned in a royal charter which was issued in late 1336. In that charter, Charles I of Hungary instructed the Eger Chapter to determine the boundaries of the domain of Bedeu (now Bedevlya in Ukraine) that he had donated to the brothers Drag and Drago»ô. Drag and Drago»ô were mentioned as the king's \\"servants\\", showing that they were directly subjected to the sovereign, like all noblemen in the Kingdom of Hungary. Historian Radu Carciumaru says that the identification of Drago»ô of Bedeu with Drago»ô, the first ruler of Moldavia has not been convincingly proven. A second scholarly hypothesis suggests that another Vlach lord, Drago»ô of Giule»ôti, was the founder of Moldavia. He was the son of one Giula, son of Drago»ô, to whom Charles I of Hungary granted two estates in Maramure»ôGiule»ôti and the nearby Nire»ôat an unspecified date, according to a royal charter, dated to 15 September 1349. Giula and his six sons (Drago»ô, Stephen, Tartar, Dragomir, Costea and MirƒÉslƒÉu) remained loyal to Charles I's son and successor, Louis I of Hungary, even when two other Vlach lords, Bogdan of Cuhea and Stephen, son of Iuga, tried to persuade them to turn against the sovereign. In revenge, Bogdan of Cuhea and Stephen expelled them from their estates. In his diploma, King Louis ordered John, the Vlach voivode of Maramure»ô, to reinstate Drago»ô of Giule»ôti and his family in the possession of their estates. Historians Victor Spinei and Istv√°n V√°s√°rhelyi say that Drago»ô of Giule»ôti and Drago»ô, voivode of Moldavia were not identical. Based on the similarity of certain place names in Maramure»ô and Moldavia, taking into account local folklore, historian »òtefan S. Gorovei proposes that Drago»ô was a member of the Codrea family who held the domain of C√¢mpulung in Maramure»ô. He says that parallel toponymsfor instance, Bedeu in Maramure»ô and BƒÉdeu»õi in Moldaviashow that Vlach groups from the region of C√¢mpulung settled in the basin of the Siret River. According to Carciumaru, no documentary evidence substantiates Gorovei's theory. The Ragusan historian, Jacob Luccari, who completed his chronicle in 1601, wrote that Drago»ô had been \\"the baron of Khust, a town in Transylvania\\" before moving to Moldavia. Khust was a fortified town in Maramure»ô in the . The Dr√°gffys, who were descended from Drago»ô, held Khust for a short period at the end of the century, but no document proves that Drago»ô had ever held the same town.  \\"Dismounting\\"  The hunt of Voivode Drago»ô' for the bison (by Constantin Lecca) The Moldavian chronicles preserved several variants of the legend of Drago»ô's hunting for an aurochs or bison, ending with his \\"dismounting\\" by the Moldova River, which gave rise to the development of Moldavia. The Anonymous Chronicle of Moldavia contains a short summary: \\"In the year 6867 Drago»ô Voivode came from the Hungarian country, from Maramure»ô, hunting an The Moldo-Polish Chronicle preserved a more detailed story: \\"By the will of God, the first voivode, Drago»ô, came from the Hungarian country from the town and river of [Maramure»ô], hunting an aurochs which he killed on the river Moldova. There he feasted with his noblemen, and liking the country he remained there, bringing [Vlachs] from Hungary as \\". According to the most comprehensive Moldo-Russian Chronicle, after the hunting Drago»ô returned to Maramure»ô to persuade the local Vlachs to accompany him back to Moldavia; they crossed the Carpathians after \\"Vladislav, the Hungarian king\\" permitted them to leave and they dismounted at the very place where Drago»ô had killed the beast. On the other hand, the 17th-century Grigore Ureche did not mention Drago»ô when narrating the legend of the \\"dismounting\\". According to Ureche's version, Transylvanian shepherds chased the aurochs and killed it at Boureni whose name is connected to the Romanian word for aurochs (bour). Ureche also stated that the head of an aurochs was put on the coat-of-arms of Moldavia on this occasion. Scholar Mircea Eliade dedicated a separate chapter to \\"Voivode Drago»ô and the ritual hunt\\" in his De Zalmoxis √† Gengis-Khan (\\"From Zalmoxis to Genghis Khan\\"), published in Paris in 1970. He concluded that the two principal motifs of the legendthe hunting and the sacrifice of the aurochswere probably based on an \\"authochtonous legend\\", describing a \\"heroic act\\" connected, for instance, to the foundation of a local chiefdom or to an act of colonization, even if the existence of a similar Dacian legend could not be proven. Eliade says that the legend of Drago»ô's hunting was only stylistically influenced by the similar Hungarian legend of Hunor and Magor. According to most chronicles, Drago»ô arrived in Moldavia in 1359. The Moldo-Polish Chronicle is the sole exception, which states that Drago»ô's \\"dismounting\\" occurred in 1352. Historians still debate the year of the foundation of Moldavia. Many historians (including »òtefan S. Gorovei, Dennis Deletant, Neagu Djuvara, and Constantine Rezachevici) propose an early date, 1347 or even 1345. They say that a successful Hungarian campaign under the command of Andrew Lackfi, Count of the Sz√©kelys, against the Tatars across the Carpathians in 1345 gave rise to the development of a defensive march, ruled by Drago»ô. According to Deletant, the establishment of that border province was connected to the foundation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Milkovia, which was sanctioned, upon the request of Louis I of Hungary, by Pope Clement VI on 27 March 1347. Other historians (for instance, Constantin C. Giurescu and Petre P. Panaitescu) accept the year proposed by the Moldo-Polish Chronicle (1352). Vlad Georgescu says that Drago»ô had participated in the Hungarian campaigns against the Tatars before Louis I made him head of the border province around 1352. Finally, there are many historians (including Victor Spinei, Istv√°n V√°s√°ry, Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean) who say, in accordance with the majority of the Moldavian chronicles, that 1359 was the year of the foundation of Moldavia. V√°s√°ry writes that Drago»ô came to Moldavia, taking advantage of the anarchy which followed the death of Berdi Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, in 1359.  Reign  Coat of arms of Moldavia The Moldo-Russian Chronicle says that Drago»ô and his people settled in the borderlands \\"where the Tatars were wandering\\". The exact borders of Moldavia during Drago»ô's reign cannot be determined. Spinei and Andreescu write that it developed in the region that is now known as Bukovina. According to the local inhabitants' tradition, Drago»ô set up his residence in Siret. The Moldo-Russian Chronicle attributed the foundation of both Siret and Baia to him. The 17th-century Miron Costin wrote that viniculture had been introduced in Moldavia by Saxon craftsmen who came upon Drago»ô's invitation. According to an interpolation by Misail the Monk in Grigore Ureche's chronicle, Drago»ô's rule in Moldavia \\"was like a captaincy\\". When Misail the Monk made his remark in the , captaincy was a military unit, made up by villagers who were obliged to render specific military services. Earlier sources did not mention that Drago»ô had participated in any military actions. Nevertheless, the fact that he was the head of a frontier zone of the Kingdom of Hungary shows that he and his retainers had an important role in the military actions east of the Carpathians. Drago»ô \\"reigned for two years\\", according to the Anonymous Chronicle of Moldavia and the Moldo-Polish Chronicle. Some historians (including Andrei Brezianu and Marcel Popa) write that Drago»ô died around 1353. According to historian Dennis Deletant, Drago»ô reigned for about seven years (until around 1354). Radu Carciumaru thinks that Drago»ô died fighting against the Tatars in 1357. According to Victor Spinei, who accepts the narrative of the majority of the Moldavian chronicles, Drago»ô died in about 1361. Drago»ô was buried in a church in VolovƒÉ»õ.  Legacy  Drago»ô and the aurochs (monument in C√¢mpulung Moldovenesc) Although most Moldavian chronicles attribute the establishment of Moldavia to Drago»ô, that tradition \\"is not in keeping with contemporary sources\\", according to Victor Spinei. For instance, one Voivode Peter, supported by the local Vlachs and Hungarians, expelled his brother, Stephen, and defeated a Polish army at ≈ûipeni≈£ (now Shypyntsi in Ukraine) in 1359, according to Jan D≈Çugosz and Filippo Buonaccorsi, which shows the existence of a Vlach polity in the lands which were integrated into Moldavia by the end of the century. Drago»ô accepted the suzerainty of Louis I of Hungary. However, numerous local Vlach groups were opposed to the rule of the king. For instance, Louis I granted Drago»ô of Giule»ôti (whom some historian identify with the first voivode of Moldavia) six villages along the river Mara in Maramure»ô on 20 March 1360, because Giule»ôti had \\"turned, with wakeful care and tireless endeavour, back to the path of unswerving many rebellious Romanians\\" in Moldavia. Drago»ô was succeeded by his son, Sas, according to the Moldavian chronicles. However, Drago»ô did not establish a dynasty, because Bogdan of Cuhea came to Moldavia and expelled Drago»ô's grandson, Balc. In compensation, Balc and his brother, Drag, received the former estates of Bogdan of Cuhea in Maramure»ô from King Louis I. Drag's descendants (members of the Dr√°gffy family) held vast estates in the northeastern parts regions of the Kingdom of Hungary in the late . The list of the voivodes, recorded in the Bistri»õa Monastery in 1407, also shows that a \\"change of dynasty\\" occurred shortly after Drago»ô's death, because it begins with Bogdan, without mentioning Drago»ô and Sas.

[https://news.microsoft.com/2004/08/24/new-microsoft-streets-trips-2005-with- gps-locator-puts-end-to-are-we-there-yet/ New Microsoft Streets & Trips 2005 With GPS Locator Puts End to ‚ÄúAre We There Yet?‚Äù The GPS version of Streets & Trips 2006 introduced voice-prompted directions, a hands-free option with turn-by-turn directional information/ Microsoft Streets & Trips 2006 With GPS Locator: The Backseat Driver Consumers Will Be Glad to Have in the Car All versions starting with 2006 and later install the new text-to-speech voice, \\"Microsoft Anna\\" on Windows XP, which is part of Windows Vista, for the voice- prompt direction feature. Version 2006 of both Streets & Trips as well as AutoRoute is the last version for Windows 98 / Me and version 2007 is the last version for Windows 2000. Streets & Trips 2008 added online services integration like MSN Direct and Live Search Maps for current traffic updates, and an automatic re-routing feature if the driver missed a turn or took a wrong turn. Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008 With Connected Services Drives Down Travel Costs and Eases Stressful Commutes Streets & Trips 2008 (and older) included 336 pushpin symbols and they were easy to spot due to the use of bright colors. Streets & Trips 2009 replaced these symbols with a new set of 46 pushpins and removed many pushpins, besides reducing their contrast. In response to this, the Streets and Trips user community created a default map template which has the 2008 pin set in order to re-add them to the program. The former pushpins were restored in the 2010 version but still with the newer visual styling. Streets & Trips 2009 also added pronunciation of street names, as part of the voice directions prompts. The map of Mexico now includes street-level data of even small towns, but the address-find feature still has not been enabled for there. This release saw the first user interface update in many years with new colorful and optionally, large toolbar icons. Streets & Trips 2010 added hide/show pushpinsets, hide/show information balloons, import/export GPX files, export to GPS navigation device, export to mobile phone, and 348 new pushpin symbols were added, the majority restored former pins as mentioned above. Streets & Trips 2011 is mainly a database update adding 88,000 miles of new mapping to the program and the removal of support for the ending MSN Direct service and coupon data, while allowing direct map correction feedback to maps provider Navteq and the addition of cardinal direction guidance and alternate road names to direction data. This version came out in February rather than the traditional August/September release date. No reasons were given. There was no release called Streets & Trips 2012. The last version, Streets & Trips 2013 was released on July 1, 2012 with a new online custom ratings and reviews feature and Metro UI-style icons. No color after installing S&T; 2013 Despite previous reports that the 2013 version did not accept data from older versions, the 2013 version converts the old files for usage and the user can save them in that format. A separate version of the product was always sold with a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver to allow users to use the product as a satellite navigation system. Since version 2008, Microsoft started requiring Product Activation for the retail versions of Streets & Trips,Product activation FAQ and troubleshooting: MS KB927007 although Volume License (VL) versions available through MSDN did not require activation. On July 7, 2014, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of Streets & Trips. Although Microsoft continues to provide mapping solutions as apps for its Windows operating system, Microsoft will provide online support for current users until July 14, 2015. Streets & Trips Homepage All versions of Windows 10 include a free GPS-ready mapping app similar to Streets & Trips. This can be used offline, though the map data must be initially downloaded before use on a state by state, province by province basis. In the U.S. and Canada, actual (not calculated) residential and commercial street addresses are included. Voice navigation is provided to GPS-enabled devices. The drawing tools from Streets & Trips have been removed, however. Compatibility Streets & Trips 2007 and later are compatible with Windows Vista and later modern operating systems (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10).

Jack Elementary was Portland's largest school until the time of its closure. The school made headlines when 100% of the teachers, administrators and other employees of the school reported symptoms related to mold poisoning from Stachybotrys chartarum. The mold can cause symptoms that are flu-like down up to pulmonary hemorrhage. The school was closed in 2001 and then later torn down as a result of the mold contamination. Students from the school were reassigned to three other schools within the city. A new school on, named East End Community School was opened in 2006. In its prime, the school was an impressive building. There were huge hallways with massive solid wood doors opening into large-size classrooms with high ceilings. The playground behind the school was built in the late 1980s by a cooperative effort involving contractors, school faculty and students, as well as members of the community who brought their own tools and donated their time. The new playground was said to be the largest and most modern playground in the city school system when it was finished. This school was originally built and known as Jack Junior High School for grade 7 and 8 students from the Munjoy Hill neighborhood, fed from Emerson School on Emerson St. and North School on Congress St (both now converted to housing).

According to the 2010 census, there were 34,160 Aghuls in Russia (7,000 in 1959).Russian Census 2010: Population by ethnicity The Aghul language belongs to the Lezgian language family, a group of the Northeast Caucasian family. Ethnically, the Aghuls are close to the Lezgins. There are four groups of the Aghul people, who live in four different gorges: Aguldere, Kurakhdere, Khushandere, and Khpyukdere. Like their neighbors the Kaitaks, the Aghuls were converted to Islam at a fairly early date, subsequent to the Arab conquest of the eighth century. Their oral traditions claim Jewish descent.Peoples, Nations and Cultures. Edited by John Mackenzie. Weidenfeld and Nicolson 2005.  Culture  Each Aghul village had a village council, on which each of the three or four tukhums were represented. The council was headed by an elder. The village mullah and qadi also played an important role in local affairs. In some cases the wealthier tukhums exerted a disproportionate strong influence on village government. As elsewhere in Daghestan, the Aghuls were divided into tukhums (clans), comprising twenty to forty households. Each tukhum had its own cemetery, pastures, and hay fields, and the members were bound by obligations of mutual support and defense. The Aghuls tended to practice endogamy within the tukhum‚Äîmarriages with outsiders were very rare. In the past the Aghuls lived in extended family households, though not especially large ones (fifteen to twenty members, on average). A senior male, father or eldest brother, functioned as chief, with fairly broad authority over the affairs of the household and its members. Should the extended family split up, sisters‚Äîeven those who had already married and left the household‚Äîreceived a portion of the land as well as the movable property. They were each apportioned one-half of the land share given to each of their brothers, a practice that was unusually generous by Daghestanian standards.

M√ºllerian mimicry is a natural phenomenon in which two or more well-defended species, often foul-tasting and that share common predators, have come to mimic each other's honest warning signals, to their mutual benefit. This works because predators can learn to avoid all of them with fewer experiences with members of any one of the relevant species. It is named after the German naturalist Fritz M√ºller, who first proposed the concept in 1878, supporting his theory with the first mathematical model of frequency- dependent selection, one of the first such models anywhere in biology. M√ºllerian mimicry was first identified in tropical butterflies that shared colourful wing patterns, but it is found in many groups of insects such as bumblebees, and other animals including poison frogs and coral snakes. The mimicry need not be visual; for example, many snakes share auditory warning signals. Similarly, the defences involved are not limited to toxicity; anything that tends to deter predators, such as foul taste, sharp spines, or defensive behaviour can make a species unprofitable enough to predators to allow M√ºllerian mimicry to develop. Once a pair of M√ºllerian mimics has formed, other mimics may join them by advergent evolution (one species changing to conform to the appearance of the pair, rather than mutual convergence), forming mimicry rings. Large rings are found for example in velvet ants. Since the frequency of mimics is positively correlated with survivability, rarer mimics are likely to adapt to resemble commoner models, favouring both advergence and larger M√ºllerian mimicry rings. Where mimics are not strongly protected by venom or other defences, honest M√ºllerian mimicry grades into bluffing Batesian mimicry. History =Origins= Fritz M√ºller The viceroy butterfly (top) appears very similar to the noxious- tasting monarch butterfly (bottom). Although it was for a long time purported to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy has recently been discovered to be actually just as unpalatable as the monarch, making this a case of M√ºllerian mimicry. M√ºllerian mimicry was proposed by the German zoologist and naturalist Johann Friedrich Theodor M√ºller (1821‚Äì1897), always known as Fritz. An early proponent of evolution, M√ºller offered the first explanation for resemblance between certain butterflies that had puzzled the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates in 1862. Bates, like M√ºller, spent a significant part of his life in Brazil, as described in his book The Naturalist on the River Amazons. Bates conjectured that these abundant and distasteful butterflies might have been caused to resemble each other by their physical environment. M√ºller had also seen these butterflies first hand, and like Bates had collected specimens, and he proposed a variety of other explanations. One was sexual selection, namely that individuals would choose to mate with partners with frequently-seen coloration, such as those resembling other species. However, if as is usual, females are the choosers, then mimicry would be seen in males, but in sexually dimorphic species, females are more often mimetic. Another was, as M√ºller wrote in 1878, that \\"defended species may evolve a similar appearance so as to share the costs of predator education.\\" =M√ºller's mathematical model= M√ºller's 1879 account was one of the earliest uses of a mathematical model in evolutionary ecology, and the first exact model of frequency-dependent selection. Mallet calls M√ºller's mathematical assumption behind the model \\"beguilingly simple\\". M√ºller presumed that the predators had to attack n unprofitable prey in a summer to experience and learn their warning coloration. Calling a1 and a2 the total numbers of two unprofitable prey species, then, M√ºller argued, if the species are completely unalike they each lose n individuals. However, if they resemble each other, then species 1 loses individuals, and species 2 loses individuals. Species 1 therefore gains and species 2 similarly gains in absolute numbers of individuals not killed. The proportional gain compared to the total population of species 1 is and similarly for species 2 , giving the per head fitness gain of the mimicry when the predators have been fully educated. Hence, M√ºller concluded, the proportion g1:g2 was , which equals , and the rarer species gains far more than the commoner one. The model is an approximation, and assumes the species are equally unprofitable. If one is more distasteful than the other, then the relative gains differ further, the less distasteful species benefiting more (as a square of the relative distatefulness) from the protection afforded by mimicry. This can be thought of as parasitic or quasi- Batesian, the mimic benefiting at the expense of the model. Later models are more complex and take factors such as rarity into account. The assumption of a fixed number n to be attacked is questionable. M√ºller also effectively assumed a step function, when a gradual change (a functional response) is more plausible. =Non-deceitful mimicry= Biologists have not always viewed the M√ºllerian mechanism as mimicry, both because the term was strongly associated with Batesian mimicry, and because no deceit was involved‚Äîunlike the situation in Batesian mimicry, the aposematic signals given by M√ºllerian mimics are (unconsciously) honest. Earlier terms, no longer in use, for M√ºllerian mimicry included \\"homotypy\\", \\"nondeceitful homotypy\\" and \\"arithmetic homotypy\\". Evolution =Aposematism, camouflage, and mimicry= M√ºllerian mimicry relies on aposematism, or warning signals. Dangerous organisms with these honest signals are avoided by predators, which quickly learn after a bad experience not to pursue the same unprofitable prey again. Learning is not actually necessary for animals which instinctively avoid certain prey; however, learning from experience is more common. The underlying concept with predators that learn is that the warning signal makes the harmful organism easier to remember than if it remained as well camouflaged as possible. Aposematism and camouflage are in this way opposing concepts, but this does not mean they are mutually exclusive. Many animals remain inconspicuous until threatened, then suddenly employ warning signals, such as startling eyespots, bright colours on their undersides or loud vocalizations. In this way, they enjoy the best of both strategies. These strategies may also be employed differentially throughout development. For instance, large white butterflies are aposematic as larvae, but are M√ºllerian mimics once they emerge from development as adult butterflies. =Selective advantage= Many different prey of the same predator could all employ their own warning signals, but this would make no sense for any party. If they could all agree on a common warning signal, the predator would have fewer detrimental experiences, and the prey would lose fewer individuals educating it. No such conference needs to take place, as a prey species that just so happens to look a little like an unprofitable species will be safer than its conspecifics, enabling natural selection to drive the prey species toward a single warning language. This can lead to the evolution of both Batesian and M√ºllerian mimicry, depending on whether the mimic is itself unprofitable to its predators, or just a free- rider. Multiple species can join the protective cooperative, expanding the mimicry ring. M√ºller thus provided an explanation for Bates' paradox; the mimicry was not, in his view, a case of exploitation by one species, but rather a mutualistic arrangement, though his mathematical model indicated a pronounced asymmetry. =Relationship to Batesian mimicry= Comparison of Batesian and M√ºllerian mimicry, illustrated with a hoverfly, a wasp and a bee The M√ºllerian strategy is usually contrasted with Batesian mimicry, in which one harmless species adopts the appearance of an unprofitable species to gain the advantage of predators' avoidance; Batesian mimicry is thus in a sense parasitic on the model's defences, whereas M√ºllerian is to mutual benefit. However, because comimics may have differing degrees of protection, the distinction between M√ºllerian and Batesian mimicry is not absolute, and there can be said to be a spectrum between the two forms. Viceroy butterflies and monarchs (types of admiral butterfly) are both poisonous M√ºllerian mimics, though they were long thought to be Batesian. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of admiral butterflies shows that the viceroy is the basal lineage of two western sister species in North America. The variation in wing patterns appears to have preceded the evolution of toxicity, while other species remain non-toxic, refuting the hypothesis that the toxicity of these butterflies is a conserved characteristic from a common ancestor. =Non-visual mimicry= M√ºllerian mimicry need not involve visual mimicry; it may employ any of the senses. For example, many snakes share the same auditory warning signals, forming an auditory M√ºllerian mimicry ring. More than one signal may be shared: snakes can make use of both auditory signals and warning coloration. =Negative frequency-dependent selection= There is a negative correlation between the frequency of mimics and the \\"survivability\\" of both species involved. This implies that it is reproductively beneficial for both species if the models outnumber the mimics; this increases the negative interactions between predator and prey. =Genetics= Some insight into the evolution of mimetic color mimicry in Lepidoptera in particular can be seen through the study of the Optix gene. The Optix gene is responsible for the Heliconius butterflies' signature red wing patterns that help it signal to predators that it is toxic. By sharing this coloration with other poisonous red winged butterflies the predator may have pursued previously the Heliconius butterfly increases its chance of survival through association. By mapping the genome of many related species of Heliconius butterflies \\"show[s] that the cis-regulatory evolution of a single transcription factor can repeatedly drive the convergent evolution of complex color patterns in distantly related species‚Ä¶\\". This suggests that the evolution of a non-coding piece of DNA that regulates the transcription of nearby genes can be the reason behind similar phenotypic coloration between distant species, making it hard to determine if the trait is homologous or simply the result of convergent evolution. =Two step evolution= One proposed mechanism for M√ºllerian mimicry is the \\"two step hypothesis\\". This states that a large mutational leap initially establishes an approximate resemblance of the mimic to the model, both species already being aposematic. In a second step, smaller changes establish a closer resemblance. This is only likely to work, however, when a trait is governed by a single gene, and many coloration patterns are certainly controlled by multiple genes. =Advergence versus mutualism= Formation of M√ºllerian mimicry rings by a process of advergence of one species or pair of mimics to another, presumably larger or more abundant. Evolution is shown on two axes denoting phenotypes for convenience; in practice there would be any number of dimensions (e.g. coloration features). The model predicts a single mimicry ring in an area, but this is not the case in Heliconius butterflies. The mimic poison frog Ranitomeya (Dendrobates) imitator is polymorphic, with a striped morph that imitates the black and yellow striped morph of Ranitomeya variabilis, a spotted morph that imitates the largely blue-green highland spotted morph also of R. variabilis, and a banded morph that imitates the red and black banded Ranitomeya summersi. A common morph of Ranitomeya (Dendrobates) imitator is aposematically striped black and yellow, but in other areas, other morphs imitate differently coloured species. R. imitator has thus apparently evolved in separate populations to resemble different targets, i.e. it has changed to resemble (adverged on) those target species, rather than both R. imitator and the other species mutually converging in the way that M√ºller supposed for tropical butterflies. Such advergence may be common. The mechanism was proposed by the entomologist F. A. Dixey in 1909 and has remained controversial; the evolutionary biologist James Mallet, reviewing the situation in 2001, suggested that in M√ºllerian mimicry, advergence may be more common than convergence. In advergent evolution, the mimicking species responds to predation by coming to resemble the model more and more closely. Any initial benefit is thus to the mimic, and there is no implied mutualism, as there would be with M√ºller's original convergence theory. However, once model and mimic have become closely similar, some degree of mutual protection becomes likely. This theory would predict that all mimicking species in an area should converge on a single pattern of coloration. This does not appear to happen in nature, however, as Heliconius butterflies form multiple M√ºllerian mimicry rings in a single geographical area. The finding implies that additional evolutionary forces are probably at work. =Mimicry complexes= File:Bombus terrestris (Buff-tailed bumblebee) - queen - Flickr - S. Rae.jpgBombus terrestris File:Bombus lucorum - Centaurea scabiosa - Keila.JPGBombus lucorum File:Bombus hortorum queen - Echium vulgare - Keila.jpgBombus hortorum File:Tree bumblebee (RLs) (34742598795).jpgBombus hypnorum M√ºllerian mimicry often occurs in clusters of multiple species called rings. M√ºllerian mimicry is not limited to butterflies, where rings are common; mimicry rings occur among Hymenoptera, such as bumblebees, and other insects, and among vertebrates including fish and coral snakes. Bumblebees Bombus are all aposematically coloured in combinations, often stripes, of black, white, yellow, and red; and all their females have stings, so they are certainly unprofitable to predators. There is evidence that several species of bumblebees in each of several areas of the world, namely the American West and East coasts, Western Europe, and Kashmir, have converged or adverged on mutually mimetic coloration patterns. Each of these areas has one to four mimicry rings, with patterns different from those in other areas. Many species of North American velvet ants in the genus Dasymutilla are involved in mimicry complexes. The relationships among mimics can become complex. For example, the poison fangblenny Meiacanthus spp. have hollow canines and poison glands, and are avoided by predatory fish. The blenny Plagiotremus townsendi resembles Meiacanthus and is eaten by a variety of predators, so it is a Batesian mimic in their case: but it is avoided by the lionfish, Pterois volitans, making it also a M√ºllerian mimic. Sets of associated rings are called complexes. Large complexes are known among the North American velvet ants in the genus Dasymutilla. Out of 351 species examined in one study, 336 had morphological similarities, apparently forming 8 distinct mimetic rings; 65 species in another study appeared to form six rings separable by both morphology and geography. Taxonomic range Pitohui kirhocephalus, from Duperrey, 1825‚Äì1839, appears to be a M√ºllerian mimic of Pitohui dichrous in some of its plumage types. M√ºllerian mimicry was discovered and has mainly been researched in insects. However, there is no reason why the mechanism's evolutionary advantages should not be exploited in other groups. There is some evidence that birds in the New Guinea genus Pitohui are M√ºllerian mimics. Pitohui dichrous and Pitohui kirhocephalus \\"share a nearly identical colour pattern\\" where their geographic ranges overlap, but differ elsewhere; they are conspicuous; and they are chemically defended by a powerful neurotoxic alkaloid, batrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin. This combination of facts implies that the populations in these zones of overlap have converged to share honest warning signals. Several mammals including the Saharan striped polecat, Ictonyx libycus, are aggressive, aposematically coloured predators. They share black-and-white patterns, suggesting M√ºllerian mimicry. Many species of flowers resemble each other but actual mimicry has not been demonstrated. It has been proposed that spiny plants such as Cactaceae and Agave in the Americas, Aloe, Euphorbia, white-thorned Acacia in Africa and spiny Asteraceae of the Mediterranean may form M√ºllerian mimicry rings, as they are strongly defended, are generally agreed to be aposematic, have similar conspicuous patterns and coloration, and are found in overlapping territories. Aposematic mammals in the families Mustelidae, Viverridae, and Herpestidae have independently evolved conspicuous black-and-white coloration, suggesting that M√ºllerian mimicry may be involved. In marketing The evolutionary zoologist Thomas N. Sherratt suggests that different types of mimicry occur in brand and product marketing. He notes that distinctive forms like the Coca-Cola bottle's shape are defended by businesses, whereas rival companies have often imitated such famous motifs to benefit from the investment and reputation of their well-known competitors, constituting Batesian mimicry. Sherratt observes that the packaging of British supermarket own brands of potato crisps are consistently colour-coded red for the ready-salted variety, blue for salt and vinegar, and green for cheese and onion, across the major chains Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda, and Waitrose. He argues that this sharing of pattern is very unlikely to have arisen by chance, in which case the resemblance is intentionally to inform customers reliably (honest signalling) of what each package contains, to mutual benefit in the manner of M√ºllerian mimicry.

The city is situated on an eminence c. 3. km from the Gulf of Taranto. The town is known for its marble and alabaster quarries. The town is the seat of a Catholic archbishop and has a notable cathedral and castle. Two Popes have been born in the town, along with Saint Nilus the Younger. History The Oratory of St. Mark. Roscianum was the original name of the town under the Roman Empire. In the 2nd century AD, emperor Hadrian built or rebuilt a port here, which could accommodate up to 300 ships. It was mentioned in the Antonine itineraries, as one of the important fortresses of Calabria. The Goths of Alaric I and, in the following century, Totila, were unable to take it. Antipope John XVI (ca. 945 ‚Äì 1001) a native of Rossano. The Rossanesi showed great attachment to the Byzantine Empire, whose local strategos had his seat here. The Rossano Gospels, a 6th Century illuminated manuscript of great historical and artistic value, is a tangible relic of that period. The Saracens failed to conquer Rossano, while in 982 Otto II captured it temporarily from the Byzantines. Its Greek character was preserved long after its conquest by the Normans, as noted by its long retention of the Greek Rite over the Latin Rite. The city in fact maintained notable privileges under the subsequent Hohenstaufen and Angevine dominations, but subsequently decayed after the feudalization in 1417. Passing to the Sforza, and thus to Sigismund I the Old, it was united in 1558 to the crown of Naples by Philip II of Spain in virtue of a doubtful will by Bona Sforza, queen of Poland in favor of Giovanni Lorenzo Pappacoda. Under Isabella of Naples and Bona, the town had been a centre of literary culture; but under the Spaniards it declined. In 1612, the crown sold the lordship to the Aldobrandini, and in 1637, it passed to the Borghese who retained it until 1806. The city was part of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799, but its conditions did not improve after the Unification of Italy, and much of the population emigrated. Rossano was the birthplace of Pope John VII and Antipope John XVI. Rossano was also the birthplace of Saint Bartholomew the Younger and Saint Nilus the Younger, who founded the Abbey of Grottaferrata, and whose \\"Life\\" is a valuable source of information about southern Italy in the Tenth Century. Main sights *The Cathedral (11th century, with massive interventions in the 18th‚Äì19th centuries) is the main historical building of Rossano. It has a nave with two aisles, and three apses. The bell tower and the baptismal font are from the 14th century, while the remaining decorations are from the 17th and 18th centuries. The church is famous for the ancient image of the Madonna acheropita (\\"Madonna not made by hands\\"), now located in the Diocesan Museum, probably dating between 580 and the first half of the eighth century. In 1879, the famous Codex Rossanensis was discovered in the sacristy. It is a Greek parchment manuscript of Matthew and Mark, written in silver on purple-stained parchment, and is one of the oldest pictorial Gospels known. Scholars date the codex from the end of the fifth to the eighth or ninth century; it is probably of Alexandrian origin.

His father was Hyrum Smith, the older brother of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. Having served for 56 years, he was the longest serving Presiding Patriarch in the history of the LDS Church. Smith traveled west to Winter Quarters and then Salt Lake City with the Mormon pioneers. He traveled with Heber C. Kimball's party and his step-mother Mary Fielding Smith. Smith joined the \\"Battalion of Life Guards\\" to protect the Latter-day Saints from Native Americans. During his life, Smith maintained strong relationships with his family members in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), particularly his cousin Joseph Smith III. Though John Smith was never released as Presiding Patriarch, some general authorities were outspoken in their disapproval of Smith's unwillingness to marry more than one plural wife and his habit of tobacco use. Smith was married to Hellen Maria Fisher with whom he had nine children. Smith married Nancy Melissa Lemmon as his plural wife after the encouragement of Brigham Young. Smith had one child with Lemmon. Early life and background John Smith was born on September 22, 1832, in Kirtland, Ohio, to Hyrum Smith and his first wife, Jerusha Barden Smith, during the early days of the Latter Day Saint movement. He was among the first generation of children raised in the church. His mother died when he was five years old. The office of Presiding Patriarch was first held by Joseph Smith Sr., the father of the religion's founder. Before his death in 1840, Joseph Smith Sr. declared his eldest living son, Hyrum, would receive the office of patriarch by virtue of lineal succession. Hyrum at this time was one of the most influential members of the church and was widely seen as the most likely successor to its leadership should he outlive his brother. However, in 1844, both Hyrum and Joseph Smith were assassinated by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. This event left the church leaderless. By consensus, it was expected that the title of Presiding Patriarch would pass to Hyrum Smith's eldest son, John. However, because John Smith was only 11 years of age at the time of his father's death, the position was instead claimed by a younger brother of Joseph Smith Jr., William, and later by the younger brother of Joseph Sr., John Smith, who was known to the church as \\"Uncle John\\". Smith was sometimes called \\"Young John\\" to differentiate him from his great-uncle. John Smith was baptized into the LDS Church in 1843 and ordained an elder in the Nauvoo Temple on January 24, 1846, at the age of thirteen. He traveled with the family of Heber C. Kimball to Winter Quarters, Nebraska when he was fifteen. In February 1847, he backtracked 150 miles to help his step-mother Mary Fielding Smith and her party. In Winter Quarters he built a log cabin for Fielding, built fences, tiled soil, and worked in the fields. In 1848, John Smith, along with Kimball, reached the Salt Lake Valley to join Brigham Young. Smith, at sixteen, personally drove five wagons down the mountains into the valley. He joined the \\"Battalion of Life Guards\\" in 1850 with the purpose of protecting the Latter-day Saints from Native Americans. After the death of Mary Fielding in 1852, Smith was required to support the family of eight. Church service On February 18, 1855, at twenty-two years old, the younger John Smith succeeded his great-uncle, \\"Uncle John\\" Smith as fifth Presiding Patriarch of the LDS Church, following the latter's death. In this capacity, Smith acted as voice in the setting apart of his younger half-brother, Joseph F. Smith as president of the church. Although Smith was glossophobic and refused nearly every public speaking assignment that Brigham Young gave him, his patriarchal blessings were eloquent. In 1862, Smith was asked to postpone his duties as a Patriarch to serve a mission in Denmark in order to \\"gain experience\\". However, according to scholar Irene M. Bates, in reality, he may have been sent on a mission because of concerns that the general authorities of the LDS Church had with Smith staying in close contact with his cousin Joseph Smith III and other relatives who participated in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). Smith was, at one time, called a \\"Josephite\\" for maintaining close relationships with his family in the RLDS Church. The general authorities of the LDS Church frequently disapproved of Smith's actions such as refusing to live with his plural wife Melissa, or refusing to marry another woman. Additionally, he was publicly rebuked at the pulpit twice in the 1894 General Conference because of his tobacco usage. Although it was intended that the oldest son of the Presiding Patriarch to succeed his father, Hyrum Fisher Smith did not succeed his father, Smith was succeeded by his grandson and Hyrum Fisher Smith's son, Hyrum G. Smith. This slight to Hyrum Fisher Smith caused some distress in the family. Although there is no official reason for this, according to Bates, it was likely because Hyrum F. Smith was separated from his wife when his father died, had a difficulty following the Word of Wisdom, and had recently had a difficult time keeping a steady job and supporting his family. John Smith was buried in Salt Lake City. He became the longest-serving Presiding Patriarch in LDS Church history, remaining in that position for 56 years, until his death from pneumonia on November 6, 1911 in Salt Lake City.State of Utah Death Certificate During his time as Patriarch, Smith gave over 20,000 blessings, willing to travel hundreds of miles on horseback in any weather condition to give blessings. Personal life John Smith's grave marker Smith was involved in plural marriage and had two wives. Smith's first wife was Hellen Maria Fisher. She was born on September 20, 1835 in Pennsylvania. Smith and Fisher married on December 25, 1853. She died on September 3, 1907. Hellen was outspoken about her lack of enthusiasm for plural marriage which was a highly encouraged practice by the LDS Church at the time. Brigham Young encouraged Smith to marry another woman, which Smith obeyed five months later. Smith married twenty-three year old Nancy Melissa Lemmon on February 18, 1857. Lemmon was born in Illinois on September 6, 1833 and died on March 29, 1915. After the death of Hellen, Joseph Smith III wrote to Smith stating that he was not surprised that Smith had not remarried, because he and Hellen had been married for a long time. Smith responded, admitting that he had been lonely since the death of Hellen, but that it would be difficult to find a substitute for Hellen since they had been married for nearly 54 years. In his letter to his cousin, Smith made no mention of Melissa to whom he was still married. Smith had nine children with Hellen Fisher. Smith had one child with Melissa Lemmon.

In 2015, its role changed with the opening of Vienna's new main station and Westbahnhof now is mainly a commuter station and the terminus of private rail operator WESTbahn's intercity service from Salzburg. Locally, Wien Westbahnhof is served by S-Bahn line S50 and U-Bahn lines U3 and U6. Six tram lines converge on Europaplatz in front of the station, although none go into the city centre. There are also buses to the airport.  Location  Westbahnhof is in Vienna's 15th District (Rudolfsheim-F√ºnfhaus) on the G√ºrtel (inner-city ring road). Mariahilfer Strasse to the immediate south-east provides a direct route into the centre of the city.  Significance  Westbahnhof is one of the busiest stations of Vienna and used to be of one of several termini for international trains in the city. With the 2015 opening of Wien Hauptbahnhof, all long-distance services of state-owned Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) were transferred to that station, although private operator WESTbahn maintains its intercity service from Salzburg. At the same time, the frequency of fast regional service along the West railway was increased. The station is also the departure point for regional rail lines into the west of Vienna that are included in the Eastern Regional Traffic Authority and belong in part to the Viennese S-Bahn. As some facilities of the station are no longer needed after its demotion, a reduction in the station's size is to be expected and concepts for the utilisation of the surplus space are already being considered.  History  = 1858 to 1949 = Built for the western railway (originally called the k.k. privilegierte Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Bahn), the station was designed by the architect Moritz L√∂hr and opened in 1858. The facility was made up of four sections built in a historical style. The main hall was 104 metres long and originally 27.2 metres wide. It was covered by a beamed iron awning and provided space for four tracks. Intervening peninsular platforms were not yet available. The exit from the hall was flanked by two towers. On the east, a two-story administration building separated the trackage from the G√ºrtel. The side wings included provision for arrivals and departures. The southerly departure side consisted of an ornamented portal with steps and three large arches supported by columns, that were crowned with statues. Access passages to the left and right of these led to the two two-storey office buildings. Through this portal, one entered the ticket hall and the departure platform. On slightly elevated terrain, the departure side offered the most impressive view of the station from the southeast. This motif was repeated in the northerly arrival side; however because of the grade, the building's foundation was lower and the portal not built up as high, as arcades offered passengers who were waiting for carriages or carts protection from the elements. In order to deal with the increased number of passengers, the two towers that flanked the departure gate were moved further apart in a modification that lasted from 1910 to 1912. The roof construction was also changed and space for a fifth track was attained. In addition, further covered platforms and departure tracks were provided in the foreground of the tracks in the terminal proper. In April 1945 the station was hit by bombs and burnt down in the course of battles at the end of World War II; the roof of the gallery collapsed. After the end of the war, the buildings were by necessity adapted for the needs of rail travel, but a complete reconstruction was decided upon, so the station was torn down in 1949. A statue of namesake of the original railway Empress Elisabeth from the original facade of the station still recalls the old station in the lower hall of the new Westbahnhof. = Since 1949 = Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz welcomes the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at Westbahnhof, July 2015. The rebuilt Westbahnhof was designed by Architects Hartiger & W√∂hnhart and opened in 1952. Because only narrow administration wings were built on the sides, space was available for eleven tracks in all, accessed from covered peninsular platforms. The centerpiece of the rebuilt Westbahnhof is the large hall giving on to the G√ºrtel (Europaplatz), which is divided into a lower and an upper level that is reached by two flights of stairs and escalators. The hall is lighted by high windows that are built into the east and west facades above the platform overhangs. The ticket windows are installed beneath the upper hall. Later on, a pavilion was built in the lower hall that offered a service centre for bookings, hotel reservations and the like. In the 1980s a parking garage was erected on the north side of the station. The Westbahnhof, with its half- timbered roof construction, enjoys protected-monument status. The U3 underground station In the course of building the U3 subway line, a large new steel and glass construction was built in 1993, which accommodates some of the station's restaurants and a cafe on several levels. The underground passage to the subway stations can be reached from the lower level. Various businesses catering to travellers are on both levels of the hall (supermarket, tobacco and newsstands, Internet cafe, post office, copy centre, snack shops, flower shops, barber shop, etc.). The police station was officially closed on April 26, 2006 because further use was not considered reasonable following a vermin infestation. = 2008 - 2011 = In mid-September 2008 a series of works commenced at Wien West, including the renovation of the listed ticket hall, the removal of the expensive, redundant flag poles outside of the station (which were placed too closely next to one another to ever carry flags), and the construction of new buildings to the left and right of the main hall, all of which are part of the new BahnhofCity project. To the left, above the park on the corner of Mariahilfer Stra√üe and Neubaug√ºrtel, an office building with a large atrium, on the other side another modern office complex with integrated hotel was constructed. The new shopping centre includes space for roughly 90 shops and various restaurants.BahnhofCity Wien West official website (German) During the construction period the entire ticket hall and the Europaplatz in front of it were shut down. A provisional station building was created south of the main hall so that the station could remain in operation. Building and refurbishing works cost roughly 200 million Euros and were finished in 2011. The station and the buildings of BahnhofCity Wien West were officially reopened on 23 November 2011.Shoppen bis der Zug kommt, ORF website, 17 November 2011 (German) = 2015 to present = With the timetable change in December 2015, all √ñBB long-distance services were re-routed through the purpose-built Lainzer Tunnel to Wien Meidling and Wien Hauptbahnhof stations, bypassing Westbahnhof. This not only simplified rail operations for the federal railways, as trains had to be reversed in Westbahnhof for through services, but also made interconnection between international, national and regional rail services faster and more efficient due to the replacement of several termini distributed across the city with one through station. This change, a significant part of Austria's contribution to the Magistrale for Europe, was a significant downgrade of the role of Westbahnhof. Train services The station is served by the following services: *Intercity services Vienna - St. P√∂lten - Linz - Wels - Salzburg *Regional services to St. P√∂lten, Amstetten and St. Valentin *Vienna S-Bahn service to Neulengbach Notable people who worked at the Westbahnhof * Franz Rauscher Commemorative coin Wien Westbahnhof was recently selected as a main motif for a high value collectors' coin: the Empress Elisabeth Western Railway commemorative coin. The reverse shows a view of the passenger hall of the first Vienna West Railway Station. The style of this building was inspired by Romantic Historism. On the right of the coin, the statue of the Empress Elisabeth can be seen. This statue still stands today in the station. In popular culture The station serves as location of the climax to the Richard Linklater film Before Sunrise.

The new converters were installed in the late 2000s for $10 million, and will offer significant savings over using diesel generators, or having the vessels use their own power systems while in port.A question of Frequency - e.nz magazine, IPENZ, November/December 09, Page 24 = RNZN College = The RNZN College is also situated at Devonport Naval Base.

At that time, it was the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, and a strategic asset for the Royal Navy. It was named for Calliope Point, out of which it had been hewn by hand over three years. Coincidentally, one of the two first ships to enter it (as a show of her capacity) was .

Biography He was born on April 16, 1883 on a farm near Bloomington, Illinois. Having an inventive father, William Lee Keeran, C.R. Keeran grew up with a creative spirit. After achieving a master's degree in engineering, he soon began patenting his ideas (circa 1906) which continued throughout his lifetime: Keeran's 2-piece vacuum seal for Mason jars, which became the standard for home-canning, was immediately popular. However, he sold off his company, White Crown Fruit Jar, in order to finance his favorite invention: the Eversharp mechanical pencil. Around 1914, Keeran invented the basic mechanism for the Eversharp, thought up the \\"Eversharp\\" trademark (inspired by the Winchester Rifle logo), and set up a company to make and sell Eversharp pencils. He relocated to Evanston, Illinois, and entered into a business alliance with the Wahl Adding Machine Company in Chicago. Wahl officers obtained a majority share in the Eversharp Pencil Company and, in 1917, forced Keeran out of the company. In 1919, Keeran registered the \\"Autopoint\\" trademark. In 1921, Keeran joined three businessmen in the Realite Pencil Company. Keeran brought the Autopoint name with him. Within a few years the company was renamed, the Autopoint Company. Keeran felt that his invention and suggestions during his association with Wahl were the basis of their prosperity. For years, he fought a battle to get just compensation from the Wahl Company. He got no satisfaction. He died on June 9, 1948 in Chicago, Illinois.

It is the 13th in the series in the original Puffin series () and 23rd in the modern Wizard series (). Rules Freeway Fighter was the first Fighting Fantasy title after House of Hell to feature an additional game mechanic: both the player's character and their vehicle have attributes for combat, as there is a combination of both individual and vehicle-based combat.

The title also features only 380 references as opposed to the typical 400. Story In Freeway Fighter, to save his town of New Hope, the hero must cross the wilderness to bring back needed supplies from the oil refinery at San Anglo. Game designer Lawrence Schick describes the scenario as being the same type as Mad Max or Car Wars. The story takes places in a post-apocalyptic United States, after much of the world's population has fallen victim to a deadly plague. The survivors huddle together in isolated settlements, while the roads are dominated by lawless nomads in heavily armed vehicles. The player takes the role of a citizen of the town New Hope who must drive their armed Dodge Interceptor motorcar across the wastes in order to procure a tanker filled with a fresh supply of petrol for their community.

In 1997, after her stormy tenure at the DOT, Schiavo wrote Flying Blind, Flying Safe, which summed up her numerous concerns about the FAA's systemic flaws. In 1987 and 1988, Schiavo, then known as Mary Sterling, handled Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests as a special assistant to then US Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. From 1989 to 1990, she also served at the United States Department of Labor as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Management Standards. She also criticized the work of the 9/11 Commission. Schiavo is interested in air safety, has represented many air-crash survivors, and appeared on investigative programs such as Frontline.\\"Flying Cheap\\" FRONTLINE, Interview with Mary E. Schiavo. PBS, February 9, 2010 She graduated from Harvard University and New York University.https://www.thestate.com/news/state/article28329487.html USDOT career In 1990 President of the United States George H.W. Bush appointed Schiavo as the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Schiavo began campaigns to curb the sale of unapproved aircraft parts. The investigations under Schiavo, by 1996, lead to over 150 criminal convictions and over $47 million USD in restitutions and fines. The resulting prison sentences from the convictions ranged up to five years per person.Bajak, Frank. \\"BLACK MARKET OF THE SKIES SUBSTANDARD AIRPLANE PARTS POSE RISK\\" Associated Press at the Columbus Dispatch. Sunday December 8, 1996. Insight 5B. Flying Blind In 1997, after leaving her post at the DOT and long before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Schiavo wrote Flying Blind, Flying Safe, a scathing expose of the fraud, corruption, waste, mismanagement, and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and the FAA, as a crusader for flight safety. Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA's reluctance to address its many shortcomings, while expressing her concern that there was a fundamental conflict of interest between the FAA job of oversight and the FAA job of promoting aviation. In Flying Blind, Schiavo describes how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers to decide whether the cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense (e.g., if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out). Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's Administrators. She writes, \\"I can't remember when I started calling these men the 'Kidney Stone Administrators', but I do know that it became apparent to me early on that they were tolerated only because everyone at the FAA knew it was merely time before they would pass.\\"Marbach, Carl Book Review, \\"Flying Blind\\" AVweb.com June 23, 1997 One reviewer was critical of the book, because he felt that \\"[h]er fundamental mistake is to argue that the FAA should pursue safety literally at all cost.\\"Poole, Robert W., Jr. Book Review, \\"Flying Blind\\" BNET (CBS Interactive Business Network) Reason. August‚ÄìSeptember 1997 Schiavo criticized the FAA for assigning monetary values to human lives; however laws requiring cost-benefit analyses (like the Regulatory Flexibility Act) require the FAA to assign monetary values to all potential losses and to analyze the cost to the public, if a proposed rule is implemented, and the cost if the rule is not implemented. The book has also been faulted many times for factual errors both scientific and legal. ValuJet Flight 592 crash After the Secretary of Transportation insisted that ValuJet was safe, Schiavo produced contrary evidence from government files. In the book's analysis of the ValuJet Flight 592 Crash, Schiavo reviews evidence the FAA had to have known ValuJet was quite unsafe. The FAA wanted ValuJet to survive, according to Schiavo, and as a result the FAA did not do its job of overseeing and enforcing rules. The FAA later shut the airline down. In 1997, unable to shake off the stigma of the crash, ValuJet merged with the smaller AirTran and started operations under that name. It has subsequently merged with Southwest Airlines. The Ohio State University In 1997, she was selected to receive the Outstanding Alumnus Award. During the 1997-98 academic year, Ms. Schiavo was a visiting professor, teaching a required graduate administrative law class, in the University's Master of Public Policy program, now the John Glenn School of Public Affairs. She was well respected by students, and received positive evaluations. At the end of the course, she provided students with a letter, offering guidance in their government careers. An especially meaningful passage reminded students that when people sought help, they generally phoned 911; however, as public servants, they were 911, meaning they had no one to phone. She reminded students of the goals and values of government, and warned that they may need to stand alone. After completing the professor in residence appointment in Public Policy, she accepted the McConnell Aviation Chair, teaching from 1998 to 2002. Columbus bomb scare In 1999, Schiavo was responsible for a bomb scare that partially shut down the Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio for four hours. No criminal charges were filed against her for the incident. 9/11 criticism Schiavo also contends FAA officials refused to believe the US faced a threat of domestic terrorism prior to 9/11, alleging flight schools \\"fairly well salivated at the thought of getting lots of foreign students, and the FAA encouraged it.\\" She has represented many of the families who have sued the U.S. airlines involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Schiavo criticized the way 9/11 commission disclosed information given to it during the several hearings. The New York Observer reported: Ms. Schiavo sat in on the commission's hearing on aviation security on 9/11 and was disgusted by what it left out. \\"In any other situation, it would be unthinkable to withhold investigative material from an independent commission,\\" she told this writer. \\"There are usually grave consequences. But the commission is clearly not talking to everybody or not telling us everything.\\" References External links * ‚Äì 'Mary Schiavos Books, Articles and Other Resources for Aviation Safety and Security' * * AvWeb.com ‚Äì 'Flying Blind, Flying Safe by Mary Schiavo' (book review), Carl Marbach (June 23, 1997) * Oprah.com ‚Äì ' An Expert Weighs in' (from the show \\"When Will You Fly Again?\\"), The Oprah Winfrey Show (November 16, 2001) * Smoke Hoods? * Suspicious Bag Shuts Down Airport (April 13, 1999) * PlaneSafe.org ‚Äì 'Mary Schiavo Speech' * StarTribune.com ‚Äì 'FAA security took no action against Moussaoui', Greg Gordon, Star Tribune (Jan 13, 2002) * Demise of the Airline Pilot ‚Äì Personal POV column regarding political \\"aviation muckracking\\" and the \\"fake bomb incident\\". \\"Culture Wars\\" April 2011. * Reason Foundation * http://www.cnn.com/profiles/mary-schiavo-profile * https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=641080&privcapId;=314750 * http://glenn.osu.edu/alumni/newsletter/past- editions/2013/alumninews8-13.html * The Ohio State University School of Public Affairs, course records Schiavio, Mary Category:American whistleblowers Category:Lawyers who have represented the United States government Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:New York Law School alumni Category:United States Department of Justice lawyers Category:United States Department of Transportation officials Category:White House Fellows Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mary Schiavo"},{"id":"2355568","text":"Everything Will Be Alright Tomorrow is a remix album released in August 2004 by the British electronica band Faithless.

He was the founding publisher of Iron Man from 1936 to 1986. Early life Rader was born on October 17, 1909 in Peru, Nebraska. He grew up near Hemingford in Box Butte County, Nebraska. He started lifting weights as a teenager and later shifted his emphasis to heavy, high repetition squats, building his bodyweight up to 210 pounds within about a year (he eventually reached 220 pounds). Career Rader was victorious in a number of local and regional weightlifting contests, and also became proficient at a number of other lifts (such as the one-hand clean) and feats of strength. Rader was the Midwestern Heavyweight Champion for seven years, with official lifts of 220 pounds in the one-hand clean and jerk, 280 pounds in the two-hand clean and jerk, and a squat of 450 pounds (without support gear). Rader founded Iron Man, a bodybuilding magazine, in 1936. It was initially called Your Physique. At its peak, the magazine had a circulation of 40,000. Rader published Iron Man through the September 1986 issue, which included a number of letters from prominent people in the field to celebrate the magazine's fiftieth anniversary. In 1986, Rader sold the magazine to John Balik, who repositioned it as a hard-core bodybuilding magazine. Rader also published Lifting News for many years. He authored approximately 1,300 magazine articles; most were in Iron Man, but some were also published in Strength Athlete. Rader was the chairman of the National Body Building Association. He was inducted into the Body Building Hall of Fame and the Power Lifting Hall of Fame. In the 1950s, alongside Bob Hoffman and Joe Weider, Rader was a \\"pioneer\\" in the commercialization of protein as a bodybuilding supplement. Personal life and death Rader married the former Mabel Kirchner in 1936; they had two sons, Jack and Gene. Rader died on November 24, 1991 in Alliance, Nebraska, at age 82.

Life She was born in Kassel, the daughter of a poor musician, Johann Schmeling. From him she learnt to play the violin, and while still a child, her playing at the fair at Frankfurt was so remarkable that money was collected to provide for her. She was helped by influential friends, and studied under Johann Adam Hiller in Leipzig for five years, alongside Corona Schr√∂ter, proving to be endowed with a wonderful soprano voice. She began to sing in public in 1771, and was soon recognized as the greatest singer that Germany had produced. She was permanently engaged for the Prussian court in Berlin, but her marriage to a debauched cellist named Mara created difficulties, and in 1780 she was released. After singing in Vienna, Munich and elsewhere, she appeared in Paris in 1782, where her rivalry with the singer Lu√≠sa Todi split the public into Todists and Maratists. In 1784 she went to London and continued to appear there with great success, with visits at intervals to Italy and to Paris till 1802, when for some years she retired to Russia, where she lost her fortune at the time of the French invasion. She visited England again in 1819, but then abandoned the stage. She went to Livonia, where she became a music teacher in Reval, and died there in 1833 in extreme poverty; she was buried at Kopli cemetery.

Located in the Semien Shewa Zone of the Amhara Region, about 120 kilometers north east of Addis Ababa on Ethiopian highway 2, the town has an elevation of 2,840 meters, which makes it the highest town of this size in Africa. It was an early capital of Ethiopia and afterwards, with Ankober and Angolalla, was one of the capitals of the kingdom of Shewa. Today, it is the administrative center of the Semien Shewa Zone of the Amhara Region.  History  = Origins = Debre Berhan was founded by Emperor Zara Yaqob, in response to a miraculous light that was seen in the sky at the time. Believing this was a sign from God showing his approval for the death by stoning of a group of heretics 38 days before, the emperor ordered a church built on the site, and later constructed an extensive palace nearby, and a second church, dedicated to Saint Cyriacus. Zara Yaqob spent 12 of the last 14 years of his life in Debre Berhan. Historian Richard Pankhurst offers the date of 1456 for the date of the founding of this church, providing a plausible argument that the light in the sky was Halley's Comet, which could have been in Shewa that year, although the traditional dates (10th day of the month of Maggabit, i.e. 6 or 7 March) do not coincide with the days that the comet was most visible (13 through 17 June). While his son Baeda Maryam did spend the first part of his reign in Debre Berhan, eventually Baeda Maryam returned to the established itinerant practice of living in a permanent encampment that was constantly on the move through the realm. The departure of the court led to a decline in the population and importance of this town. Pankhurst explains that the needs of the imperial court and army‚Äîwho numbered in the thousands‚Äîfor firewood and food was so burdensome that, \\"it could not remain in any one locality for more than four months, nor return to the same place in less than 10 years due to the resultant shortage of food\\",Pankhurst, Ethiopian Towns, p. 41 which prevented the growth of any capital city in this period. = 16th-18th Century = While little more than a large village, Debre Berhan is mentioned a few times in the 16th century, the first time as a mustering center by Emperor Lebna Dengel against the invading armies of Ahmad Gragn.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), p. 59. After he had defeated Lebna Dengel at the Battle of Amba Sel, Ahmad mustered his troops twice in Debre Berhan before leading them on campaigns deeper into Ethiopian territory. At the second mustering in 1535, he proclaimed before his followers, \\"Thanks be to God, Abyssinia is conquered. Only Tigray, Begemder and Gojjam are left... Shall we march against them, or shall we stay on in this region for a year until we have settled it down?\\" then led them into the Ethiopian highlands.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Futuh al-Habasa, pp. 337f. = 19th Century = The village regained importance in the reign of Asfa Wossen (1775‚Äì1808), Meridazmach of Shewa, who built a palace there, and divided his time amongst this town, Ankober and Angolalla.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Towns, pp. 188f The succeeding Meridazmaches prized Debre Berhan as a hunting lodge for its surrounding plains, and used it as a riding place.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Towns, p. 280 His son Sahle Selassie rebuilt Debre Berhan after it had been ravaged by Abichu Oromo at the beginning of his reign, and built a church dedicated to the Selassie (\\"Trinity\\") in this capital. When then Negus Menelik submitted to Emperor Yohannes IV in the treaty of Wadara of 1878, it was also stipulated that the capital of Shewa would be moved from Liche to Debre Berhan. The Debre Berhan market in the 1880s was considered important for mules and horses. The Selassie church was rebuilt by Emperor Menilek in 1906 and contains many mural paintings.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 16 December 2007) David Buxton believes that it was inevitable that Debre Berhan would regain importance, \\"Although a somewhat cold and inhospitable place,\\" he writes about the town, \\"it has an obvious advantage as commanding what must always have been an important focus of routes. Even in modern times it was inevitable that the Asmara road should be brought through this easy passage, avoiding the impassable gorges on the other.\\"D. R. Buxton, \\"The Shoan Plateau and Its People: An Essay in Local Geography\\", Geographical Journal, 114, (1949), p. 162 = 20th Century = Debre Berhan received electricity in 1955 when a 90 kW hydro-electric power station was put into service; by 1965, the installed electrical capacity in the town was 125 kVA and annual production 103,000 kWh. On 26 April 1957, Emperor Haile Selassie opened the Community Teacher Training School in the town.\\"Opens Debre Berhan Teacher Training Center\\", Selected Speeches of His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, New York : One Drop Books, 2000, pp.76-79 By 1958 it was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. On 2 July 1994 it was broadcast that nine people were killed and eleven captured in an exchange of fire with security forces in Asagirt woreda. The people were alleged to have broken into the Debre Berhan prison before that, setting a number of prisoners free. According to the police, Andale Melaklu, the Debre Berhan representative of the All-Amhara People's Organization was one of the \\"bandits\\" killed in the fire exchange.  Demographics  Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 65,231, of whom 31,668 are men and 33,563 women. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 94.12% reporting that as their religion, while 3.32% of the population said they were Muslim and 2.15% were Protestants.Census 2007 Tables: Amhara Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4. The 1994 national census reported a total population for Debre Berhan of 38,717 in 8,906 households, of whom 17,918 were men and 20,799 were women. The five largest ethnic groups reported in the town were the Amhara (90.12%), the Oromo (3.94%), the Tigrayan (1.81%), the Gurage (1.6%), and the Argobba (1.2%); all other ethnic groups made up 1.33% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 93.81%, Oromiffa was spoken by 3.04%, and 1.5% spoke Tigrinya; the remaining 1.65% spoke all other primary languages reported. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 94.59% reporting that as their religion, while 4.05% were Muslim, and 1.02% Protestant.1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Amhara Region, Vol. 1, part 1 , Tables 2.1, 2.7, 2.10, 2.13, 2.17, Annex II.2 (accessed 9 April 2009)  Climate  Debre Berhan is one of the coolest cities found in the subtropical zone of Ethiopia. The city has a typical subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen Cwb). The average annual temperature of the city during day and night hour is 20.7 ¬∞C and 8.2 ¬∞C respectively with precipitation 964mm.  Local economy  Debre Birhan is located along Ethiopian Highway 2, which connects Addis Abeba with the north of the country. The gravel road between Debre Berhan and Ankober, 42 kilometers in length, was overhauled in May 2009.\\"42-km Debrebirhan-Ankober road being maintained\\", Ethiopian News Agency, 29 May 2009 (accessed 30 May 2009) The Debre Berhan Wool Factory, the first wool factory in Ethiopia, started production was 1 January 1965 with 120 spindles and 6 looms, having the capacity to process one metric ton of wool daily. In its first six months, the factory produced 7,065 blankets in a single-shift operation with a labor force of about 200, of whom 45% were women. The Derg government announced 3 February 1975 that the Debre Berhan Wool Factory was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully nationalised. Debre Berhan is also a famed center of rug making.  Landmarks  Despite its historical importance, none of the buildings Emperor Zara Yaqob built exist today, and no obvious 19th century construction is visible.

He represented New York in the U.S. House for one term. Biography Chase was born in Cooperstown, New York in 1789. He was educated locally, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1815. In 1818, he studied at the Litchfield Law School. In addition to practicing law in Richfield, Chase was active in other business ventures; he was part-owner of a hotel and tavern, and was one of the original incorporators of the Otsego County Bank. He held various positions in local and county government, including postmaster of Richfield and the judicial position of Master in Chancery. From 1821 to 1829 he was District Attorney of Otsego County. In 1826, Chase was elected to the 20th Congress as a supporter of John Quincy Adams. He served one term, 1827 to 1829, after which he returned to his Otsego County law practice. Death and burial Chase died in Richfield on August 3, 1838, and was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Richfield. Chase's grave marker indicates that he died in 1839; this is clearly in error, since contemporary newspaper accounts and the probate process for his estate give his year of death as 1838. Family In 1828, Chase married in Washington, DC Mary Frances Whetcroft, the daughter of William Whetcroft and Anne Winchester Whetcroft of Annapolis, Maryland. After Chase's death, Mary Whetcroft married Philetus Allen of Springville. Chase's children included Frank Chase (September 18, 1838‚ÄîJanuary 14, 1902), who was born the month following Chase's death. Frank Chase was a graduate of Albany Law School, and resided in Concord and Springville. In addition to practicing law, he was involved in local politics and government, including service as Springville's town supervisor and a justice of the peace.

Shultz and Roy Godson, Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 132-133. but they can be among the most effective means of influencing foreign opinion and actions as they hold considerable credibility among the target audience.Robert K.

Most commonly they serve the interests of a foreign power in one of three ways: either as a controlled agent directly recruited and controlled by a foreign power; as a \\"trusted contact\\" that consciously collaborates to advance foreign interests but is not directly recruited or controlled by a foreign power; or as a \\"useful idiot\\" that is completely unaware of how their actions further the interests of a foreign power.Richard H.

When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence.Paul A.

Characteristics Leon Trotsky, who popularized the term \\"fellow traveller\\" in 1924.

The primary characteristic that distinguishes agents of influence from spies is the lack of absolute control exercised by the foreign power on an agent of influence. According to Angelo Codevilla, the work of an agent of influence \\"can be far more valuable, subtle, and dangerous than that of a mere spy\\".Angelo M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends\\", in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 220. As witnessed in the Cold War through \\"fellow travelers\\", the best agents of influence were those whose interests paralleled that of the aggressor's and needed little if any coordination.Angelo M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends,\\" in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 221. A foreign power can rarely exercise complete control over an agent of influence, as these agents possess their own preferences and motivations; the most proven way to cultivate the desired results is for a foreign power to choose and develop an agent of influence whose interests already align with their own. Overlooking an agent of influence's different motivations can have negative consequences, as witnessed in World War I, when German political warfare strategists sent Vladimir Lenin back to St. Petersburg in an effort to foster domestic instability and get Russia out of the war in 1917. Since Lenin had different motivations and interests than the German government at the time, he acted in a manner not suited to German interests, and grew so powerful that his party was instrumental to bringing down Imperial Germany. Excessive efforts to control or exploit agents of influence can also have negative consequences. Such agents are best seen as strategic or tactical allies, and efforts to exercise too much control over them may result in the loss of an influence asset. Excessive exploitation of these agents can lead to their exposure by forcing them to take questionably one-sided positions, as witnessed in the exposure of Norwegian Arne Treholt.Angello M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare,\\" in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 86. Because these agents exercise influence, their positions and opinions are not wholly secret, but the level to which they coordinate activities with a hostile power is likely to be kept secret.Angello M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare,\\" in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 85. Agents of influence are most effective because they bring with them a sense of credibility among the target audience, and they use this credibility to convey a story or manipulate a situation in favor of the foreign power with which they share common preferences and motivations. This credibility makes agents of influence so effective that, according to Angelo Codevilla, using these agents is an act of war \\"in the same sense that armies crashing across border or airplanes dropping bombs are acts of war because their results can be as intrusive or conclusive as the results of armies or bombs.\\"Angelo M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends,\\" in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 211. Known agents of influence Accused agent of influence and convicted spy Arne Treholt Individuals operating as an agent of influence may serve in the fields of journalism, government, art, labor, academia, or a number of other professional fields. Cultural opinion makers, nationalists, and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of influence. The following are some notable individuals that have been accused of being foreign agents of influence. The list is not exhaustive but is meant to show the wide range in which such agents can operate. As previously noted, proving someone is an agent of influence is among the most difficult endeavors, even for the most skilled counterintelligence officers. * Alger Hiss: an agent of influence and spy.Angelo M.

Organizational functioning In addition to individual agents of influence, front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this capacity. When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence. It is important to note, however, that not all front organizations focus exclusively on influence operations, as some have more specific objectives (intelligence collection, etc.). The Cold War is a recent example of increased use of not only front organizations, but of front organizations being used as agents of influence to alter the target nation's belief system and policies on the international stage.Tony Shaw, \\"The Politics of Cold War Culture,\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 3, no. 3 (Fall 2001): pg. #, http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/tshaw.htm. The use of organizations as agents of influence during the Cold War is a recent example that serves to illustrate how frequently front organizations were used in an attempt to alter the perceptions and actions of a foreign nation and its public. A Communist front organization is an organization identified to be a front organization under the effective control of a Communist party, the Communist International or other Communist organizations.Sheila Suess Kennedy, Free Expression in America: A Documentary History (Greenwood Press, 1999) pp. 111-122. Lenin originated the idea in his manifesto of 1902, \\"What Is to Be Done?\\". Since the party was illegal in Russia, he proposed to reach the masses through \\"a large number of other organizations intended for wide membership and, which, therefore, can be as loose and as public as possible.\\"Quoted in Theodore Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia (2003) p 172 Generally called \\"mass organizations\\" by the Communists themselves,Donald Hindley, The Communist Party of Indonesia 1951-1963 (1966) p. 56 these groups were prevalent from the 1920s through the 1950s, with their use accelerating during the Popular Front period of the 1930s. Starting in 1939, Attorney General Biddle began compiling a list of Fascist and Communist front organizations. It was called \\"Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations\\" (AGLOSO), but was not at first made public.Robert Justin Goldstein, \\"Prelude to McCarthyism,\\" Prologue, Fall 2006, Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 22-33 Political pressures from Congress forced President Harry S.

The Finnish troops were greatly outnumbered but managed to contain the Soviet troops due to the extreme terrain and weather. Order of battle =Finland= The Finnish troops consisted of the 10th Separate Company (10.Er.K) in Parkkina and the 5th Separate Battery (5.Er.Ptri, four 76 mm field cannons, from year 1887) in Liinahamari. The separate companies and batteries didn't belong to any specific division of the Finnish Army and could be placed in ad hoc formations. The troops were part of the Lapland Group (Lapin Ryhm√§) of the Finnish Army which had its headquarters at Rovaniemi. The troops were later reinforced with the 11th Separate Company and a 3rd Company which wasn't part of the original mobilization plans. Also the small Reconnaissance Group 11 (Tiedusteluosasto 11) was added to the troops. All the troops were called Detachment Pennanen (Osasto Pennanen, totalling under 900 men) after their commander captain Antti Pennanen. =Soviet Union= The Soviet Union had the 14th Army in the Kola Peninsula. The army consisted of three divisions, the 104th, 52nd and the 14th, operational power totalling ca. 52,500 men. Only the 104th and 52nd Divisions took part in the field operations in Petsamo, 14th occupying Liinahamari harbour. The Soviets had an overwhelming superiority in troops in the area, but most Soviet troops were preparing to fight against a possible British-French landing near Murmansk and were not involved in the fight against Finland. The battle Elements of the 104th Division crossed the border on 30 November 1939 and occupied the Finnish part of the Rybachi Peninsula. The 242nd Infantry Regiment of the 104th Division reached Parkkina on 1 December. The Finnish troops withdrew to Luostari. The 52nd Division was moved to Petsamo by boat. The 52nd took over the attack from the 104th and pushed back Detachment Pennanen all the way to H√∂yhenj√§rvi until the attack was halted on 18 December. During the following two months the Soviet forces stood still. During this time the Finnish troops made several reconnaissance and guerilla raids behind enemy lines. After the two-month pause the Soviet advance continued and this time attacks on 25 February forced the Finnish troops to Nautsi near Lake Inari. Here the troops stayed until the end of the war. The Peace In the Moscow Peace Treaty, Finland was forced to cede parts of her territory to the Soviet Union. Among these areas was the Finnish part of the Rybachy Peninsula (Kalastajasaarento/Fiskarhalv√∂n) in the extreme north of Petsamo. The Soviet Union would take the whole Petsamo area after the Continuation War.

Serving the armies of the Papal States during the war for Italian unification in 1860, he was recruited into the Union Army during the American Civil War, serving as a cavalry officer, particularly under Brig. Gen. John Buford during the Gettysburg Campaign and the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. After the war, Keogh remained in the regular United States Army as commander of I Troop of the 7th US Cavalry Regiment under George Armstrong Custer during the Indian Wars, until he was killed along with Custer and all of his men at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.  Career  Myles Keogh was born in Orchard House, Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, on 25 March 1840. The farming carried out at Keogh's home place in Leighlinbridge was arable, barley being the main crop. This meant that the Keogh family were largely unaffected by the hunger and poverty that accompanied the Great Famine and ravaged the country between 1845 and 1850 ‚Äì Keogh's childhood days. However, two, or possibly three, of Keogh's siblings did die young, apparently from typhoid ‚Äì a disease associated with the famine and an illness that Myles also suffered as a boy. He attended the National School in Leighlinbridge where he was enrolled under the spelling 'Miles Kehoe'.http://www.littlebighorn.info/Articles.htm\\" ‚Äì \\"A Visit to Orchard\\", Kimber, Doyle 2008 ‚Äì \\"At Classics\\" was recorded as the reason for leaving in 1852. He was long thought to have attended St. Patrick's College in Carlow but that college has not found any proof of his attendance. It is possible that he attended St. Mary's Knockbeg College where, from 1847, young lay pupils from St. Patrick's were sent to be educated. By 1860, a twenty- year-old Myles Keogh had volunteered, along with over one thousand of his countrymen, to rally to the defence of Pope Pius IX following a call to arms by the Catholic clergy in Ireland. By August 1860, Keogh was appointed second lieutenant of his unit in the Battalion of St. Patrick, Papal Army under the command of General Christophe L√©on Louis Juchault de Lamorici√®re. He was posted at Ancona, a central port city of Italy. The Papal forces were defeated in September in the Battle of Castelfidardo, and Ancona was surrounded. The soldiers, although having admirable defence, were forced to surrender and Keogh was imprisoned at Genoa. After his quick release by exchange, Keogh went to Rome and was invited to wear the spirited green uniforms of the Company of St. Patrick as a member of the Vatican Guard. During his service, the Holy See awarded him the Medaglia for gallantry ‚Äì the Pro Petri Sede Medal ‚Äì and also the Cross of a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great ‚Äì Ordine di San Gregorio.Myles Keogh: The Life and Legend of an \\"Irish Dragoon\\" in the Seventh Cavalry, John P. Langellier, Kurt Hamilton Cox, Brian C. Pohanka, 1998, . Now that the fighting was over and duties of the Vatican Guard were more mundane, Keogh saw little purpose in remaining at Rome. With civil war raging in America, Secretary of State William H. Seward began seeking experienced European officers to serve the Union, and called upon a number of prominent clerics to assist in his endeavour. John Hughes, Archbishop of New York, travelled to Italy to recruit veterans of the Papal War, and met with Keogh and his comrades. Thus in March 1862 Keogh resigned his commission in the Company of Saint Patrick, and with his senior officer ‚Äì 30-year-old Daniel J. Keily of Waterford ‚Äì returned briefly to Ireland, then boarded the steamer \\"Kangaroo\\" bound from Liverpool to New York, where the vessel arrived 2 April. Another Papal comrade, Joseph O'Keeffe ‚Äì 19-year-old nephew of the Bishop of Cork ‚Äì met with Keogh and Keily in Washington. General Buford (seated) and staff, Keogh (left) Through Secretary Seward's intervention, the three were given Captains' rank and on 15 April assigned to the staff of Irish-born Brigadier General James Shields, whose forces were about to confront the Confederate army of Stonewall Jackson. They notably stormed after Jackson's army in the Shenandoah Valley and nearly captured the furious leader at the Battle of Port Republic. Jackson may have slipped into the hills, but Keogh's courageousness during his first engagement did not go unnoticed. George B. McClellan, the commander of the Potomac Army, was impressed with Keogh, describing the young Captain as \\"a most gentlemanlike man, of soldierly appearance,\\" whose \\"record had been remarkable for the short time he had been in the army.\\"The Honor of Arms: A Biography of Myles W. Keogh, Charles L. Convis, 1990, . On McClellan's request, Keogh was temporarily transferred to his personal staff. He was to be with 'Little Mac' for only a few months but served the General during the Battle of Antietam. After McClellan's removal from command in November 1862, the admirable traits identified in his first six months in the Union army came to the fore when he and his Papal comrade, Joseph O'Keeffe, were reassigned to General John Buford's staff.Son of the Morning Star, Evan S. Connell, 1984, Although held in reserve with the rest of the Union cavalry for the winter of 1862 and during the Battle of Fredericksburg, Myles Keogh and O'Keeffe served Buford with obedience and gallantry during the Stoneman Raid in April 1863 and the enormous battle on 9 June at Brandy Station, which was practically all cavalry. Buford's 1st Division of cavalry fought with distinction in June 1863 as they skirmished with their much vaunted Confederate foe, led by J.E.B. Stuart in Loudoun County, Virginia ‚Äì most notably at Upperville. 1865 ‚Äì Major Myles Keogh, Union Army, standing, Robert Morrow seated Myles Keogh On 30 June, Buford, with Keogh by his side, rode into the small town of Gettysburg. Very soon, Buford realised that he was facing a superior force of rebels to his front and set about creating a defence against the Confederate advance. He was acutely aware of the importance of holding the tactically important high ground about Gettysburg and so he did, beginning one of the most iconic battles in American military history. His intelligent defensive troop alignments, coupled with the bravery and tenacity of his dismounted men, allowed the 1st Corps, under General John F. Reynolds, time to come up in support and thus maintain a Union foothold at strategically important positions. Despite Lee's barrage attack of 140 cannons and a final infantry attack on the third day of the battle, the Union army won a highly significant victory. The importance of Buford's leadership and tactical foresight on 1 July cannot be overstated in its contribution to this victory. Significantly, Myles Keogh received his first brevet for \\"gallant and meritorious services\\" during the battle and was promoted to the rank of major. The battle was over and so were almost 8,000 men's lives with it. However this was a turning point in the war, and a turning point in Buford's health. Five further months of almost constant skirmishing with J.E.B. Stuart's Rebel cavalry at such battles as Funkstown and Willamsport worsened Buford's condition. As Keogh later wrote in Buford's service record (etat de service), Buford \\"was taken ill from fatique and extreme hardship\\". By the winter Buford would succumb to typhoid. Keogh would stay by his side and care for him, while they rested in Washington at the home of an old friend General George Stoneman. Buford was buried at West Point Cemetery, as Keogh attended his funeral at Washington and rode with his body on the train. Major Keogh was now appointed as aide de camp to General George Stoneman. In July 1864, Stoneman raided to the south and southeast, destroying railroads and industrial works. Their risky raids behind Confederate lines were also designed to free federal prisoners held at Macon, Georgia, and liberate the nearly 30,000 captives at Andersonville prison. Although Stoneman's Union cavalry did destroy the railroads, the onslaught on Macon failed from the beginning and on 31 July 1864, Keogh and Stoneman's command were surrounded during the Battle of Sunshine Church, Georgia. They were captured after both their horses were shot out from under them. Keogh was held for 2¬Ω months as a prisoner of war before being released through Union general William Tecumseh Sherman's efforts. Keogh would later receive a second brevet with promotion to lieutenant colonel for his gallantry with Stoneman at the Battle of Dallas. The praise garnered from the commanders Myles Keogh served with during the war years was indeed high: At the war's end, brevet Lt. Colonel Keogh chose to remain on active duty and accepted a Regular Army commission as a second lieutenant in the 4th Cavalry on 4 May 1866. On 28 July 1866 he was promoted to Captain, and reassigned to the 7th Cavalry at Ft. Riley in Northeast Kansas where he took command of Company I. The 7th Cavalry Regiment was first commanded by Colonel Andrew Smith (from 1866 to 1869) and subsequently by Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis (from 1869 to 1886). George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's Lieutenant Colonel and its deputy commander.  Postbellum career  Officers of the 7th Cavalry ‚Äì Myles W. Keogh, seated front Keogh was generally well liked by fellow officers although the isolation of military duty on the western frontier often weighed heavily upon him. When depressed he occasionally drank to excess, though he seems not to have fallen prey to the chronic alcoholism that destroyed the careers of many fellow officers of the frontier Regular Army. There was more than a tinge of melancholy in Keogh's nature, which seemed somehow at odds with his handsome, dashing persona. While he was not given to self-analysis, Keogh once noted: Keogh was also fond of the ladies, though he never married: He did, however, carry a photograph of Capt. Thomas McDougall's sister, Josephine Buel, with him to Little Bighorn. Although absent from the Washita battle (1868) and the Yellowstone Expedition (1873), Custer's encounters of substance with hostile Indians, Keogh did have sole responsibility for defending the Smoky Hill route against Indian raids from late 1866 to the summer of 1867. When Sheridan took over from Hancock in 1868, there is evidence that it was to Keogh he turned for first-hand information on conditions on the front line. And while with Sully's expedition later that year, Keogh was fighting Indians almost every day‚Äîindeed, it was in one such fight that his new mount, Comanche, received his first wound and, as the story goes, his name. Captain Keogh's frustration with an enemy who did not fight in a conventional manner is evident from a comment he wrote in a personal letter to his family in Ireland: In the summer of 1874, Keogh was on leave to visit his homeland on a seven-month leave of absence, while Custer was leading a controversial expedition through the Black Hills. During this second visit home he deeded his inherited Clifden estate in Kilkenny to his sister Margaret. He enjoyed his stay in his homeland, feeling the necessity to support his sisters after the death of both parents. Telegram informing of the death of Myles Keogh In October, Keogh returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln for his old duty with Custer, and it would be his last days. As a precaution, he purchased a $10,000 life insurance policy and wrote a letter of warning to his close friends in the Throop-Martin family, Auburn, New York, outlining his burial wishes: He gave out copies of his will to comrades, and left behind personal papers with instructions that they be burned if he was killed. Keogh died during Custer's Last Stand ‚Äì the Battle of the Little Bighorn on 25 June 1876. The senior captain among the five companies wiped out with Custer that day, and commanding one of two squadrons within the Custer detachment, Keogh died in a \\"last stand\\" of his own, surrounded by the men of Company I. When the sun- blackened and dismembered dead were buried three days later, Keogh's body was found at the center of a group of troopers that included his two sergeants, company trumpeter and guidon bearer. The slain officer was stripped but not mutilated, perhaps because of the \\"medicine\\" the Indians saw in the Agnus Dei (\\"Lamb of God\\") he wore on a chain about his neck or because \\"many of Sitting Bull's warriors\\" were Catholic.Charles A. Coulombe, The Pope's Legion (New York: palgrave macmillan, 2008), 205 Keogh's left knee had been shattered by a bullet that corresponded to a wound through the chest and flank of his horse, indicating that horse and rider may have fallen together prior to the last rally. Keogh's horse Comanche American Horse the Elder Keogh Battlefield Marker 1879 The badly injured animal was found on the fatal battlefield, and nursed back to health as the 7th Cavalry's regimental mascot, which he remained until his death in 1890.http://www.thewildgeese.com/pages/plains.html ‚Äì Brian C. Pohanka. This horse, Comanche, is considered the only U.S. military survivor of the battle, though several other badly wounded horses were found and destroyed at the scene. Keogh's bloody gauntlet and the guidon of his Company I were recovered by the army three months after Little Bighorn at the Battle of Slim Buttes. Originally buried on the battlefield, Keogh's remains were disinterred and taken to Auburn, as he had requested in his will. He was buried at Fort Hill Cemetery (bio and photos) on 26 October 1877, an occasion marked by citywide official mourning and an impressive military procession to the cemetery. Tongue River Cantonment, in southeastern Montana, was renamed after him to be Fort Keogh. The fort was first commanded by Nelson A. Miles. The 55,000-acre fort is today an agricultural experiment station. Miles City, Montana is located two miles from the old fort. = Funeral = We extract from the Auburn papers the following accounts of the burial of the late Col. Myles W. Keogh, at Fort Hill Cemetery, Auburn, NY. 26 October: Promptly at 2pm the funeral procession moved from the St James Hotel, where the pallbearers had assembled, and marched in the following order: The Pall-Bearers; Auburn City Band; Military, Lt. Judge, commanding; Post Crocker, G.A.R.; Post Seward G.A.R.; Hearse, draped with the National colors; Carriages bearing the family of E. T. Throop Martin and Army officers. A detail from Post Seward fired minute guns during the march and the ceremonies at the grave. The flag at the State Armoury was flown at half-mast, as were numerous other flags about the city. Volunteers from the several Auburn organisations of the 49th NY Militia were formed into a company, charged with the duties of escort and firing party, according to military etiquette. At the receiving vault the casket was draped with the American flag, upon which were placed some beautiful floral designs. The bearers then placed the casket in the hearse and the line moved to the grave on the lot of E.T. Throop Martin Esq. The pall-bearers were Gen. W. H. Seward, Col. C.C. Dwight, Col. J. E. Storke, Col. E.D. Woodruff, Surgeon Theo. Dimon, Major L.E. Carpenter, Major W.G. Wise and Capt. W.M. Kirby. The following officers of the regular army were present: Gen. L.C. Hunt, Col. R.N. Scott, Surgeon R.N. O'Reilly, Gen. A. J. Alexander, Lieut. J.W. Martin. The grave was laid with evergreens and flowers, and at its head, the base of a handsome monument to be erected in memory of this dead soldier, was strewn with other floral tributes. The remains were lowered into the grave, when the solemn burial service was read by Rev. Dr. Brainard. A dirge was then executed by the band, after which three volleys of musketry were fired by the military, and the procession marched from the cemetery in the same order as on its entry, the immediate friends remaining until the grave was closed. The obsequies were most solemn and imposing, and in every way befitting the rank and record of the fallen brave in whose honour they were held.New York Army & Navy Journal The prominent Throop-Martin family, with whom Keogh had become friendly after his comrade General A.J. Alexander married Evelina Martin, was responsible for his burial in their Fort Hill plot and the design of his monument. At the base of decorative, white obelisk there is an inscription taken from the poem, The Song of the Camp by Bayard Taylor: \\"Sleep soldier still in honored rest, Your truth and valor wearing; The bravest are the tenderest, The loving are the daring.\\" The marble cross atop his grave was added later at the request of his sister in Ireland.

It is found in many gums such as gum arabic (c. 18%), xanthan, and Kombucha tea and is important for the metabolism of microorganisms, plants and animals.  Properties  The Œ≤-D-methyl glycoside of glucuronic acid in the low energy 4C1 conformation of D-glucose Glucuronic acid is a sugar acid derived from glucose, with its sixth carbon atom oxidized to a carboxylic acid. In living beings, this primary oxidation occurs with UDP-Œ±-D-glucose (UDPG), not with the free sugar. Glucuronic acid, like its precursor glucose, can exist as a linear (carboxo-)aldohexose (<1%), or as a cyclic hemiacetal (furanose or pyranose). Aldohexoses such as D-glucose are capable of forming two furanose forms (Œ± and Œ≤) and two pyranose forms (Œ± and Œ≤). By the Fischer convention, glucuronic acid has two stereoisomers (enantiomers), D\\\\- and L-glucuronic acid, depending on its configuration at C-5. Most physiological sugars are of the D-configuration. Due to ring closure, cyclic sugars have another asymmetric carbon atom (C-1), resulting in two more stereoisomers, named anomers. Depending on the configuration at C-1, there are two anomers of glucuronic acid, Œ±- and Œ≤-form. In Œ≤-D-glucuronic acid the C-1 hydroxy group is on the same side of the pyranose ring as the carboxyl group. In the free sugar acid, the Œ≤-form is prevalent (~64%), whereas in the organism, the Œ±-form UDP-Œ±-D- glucuronic acid (UDPGA) predominates. Carbohydrate stereoisomers, which differ in configuration at only one (other) asymmetric C-atom, are named epimers. For example, D-mannuronic (C-2), D-alluronic (C-3), D-galacturonic (C-4), and L-iduronic acid (C-5) are epimers of glucuronic acid. The nonplanar pyranose rings can assume either chair (in 2 variants) or boat conformation. The preferred conformation depends on spatial interference or other interactions of the substituents. The pyranose form of D-glucose and its derivative D-glucuronic acid prefer the chair 4C1. Additional oxidation at C-1 to the carboxyl level yields the dicarboxylic glucaric acid. Glucuronolactone is the self-ester (lactone) of glucuronic acid. Direct oxidation of an aldose affects the aldehyde group first. A laboratory synthesis of a uronic acid from an aldose requires protecting the aldehyde and hydroxy groups from oxidation, for example by conversion to cyclic acetals (e. g., acetonides). Sodium glucuronate can be produced by the direct oxidation of starch with concentrated nitric acid. In this preparation the low availability of water keeps the starch polymers from hydrolyzing and only oxidizes the free hydroxyls, in much the same way that nitrogen dioxide would oxidize the starch. Once this reaction is complete, and the starch/nitric acid mix turns clear (after giving off nitrogen dioxide gas), the solution can be diluted, and hydrolyzed with another mineral acid. Then the oxidation is slowly quenched with sodium hydroxide (or sodium bicarbonate), forming sodium glucuronate, which can be crystallized out of solution.With transition metals, it forms complexes such as Iron(III)glucuronate,Iron(II)glucuronate,and Copper(II)glucuronate. Functions = Proteoglycans = Glucuronic acid is a common building block of proteoglycans and glycoglycerolipids: * Heparin is an inhibitor of blood coagulation, and occurs in mast cells, lung and liver. * Chondroitin sulfate is found in large quantities in cartilage, aorta, connective tissue, bone, and skin. * Dermatan sulfate is a proteoglycan in skin, heart, and blood vessels. * Keratan sulfate is found in the cornea, cartilage, and bone. * Hyaluronic acid occurs in large quantities in connective tissues, skin, cartilage, and synovial fluid. * Glycoglycerolipids of glucuronic or galacturonic acids form the cell walls of bacteria. = Glucuronidation = Glucuronidation of 4-aminobiphenyl by formation of a Œ≤-glycosidic bond. UDP-Œ±-D-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is often involved in the phase II metabolism (conjugation) of lipophilic xeno- and endobiotics. These linkages involve glycosidic bonds with thiol, amine and hydroxy groups, or esterification with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. This linkage process is known as glucuronidation (or glucuronide conjugation). Glucuronidation occurs mainly in the liver, although the enzymes responsible for its catalysis, UDP- glucuronyltransferases (UDP-GT), have been found in all major body organs, e.g., intestine, kidneys, brain, adrenal gland, spleen, and thymus. Analogous reactions occur with other UDP-uronic acids (e. g., D-galacturonic acid). Glycosides resulting from glucuronidation are named Œ≤-D-glucuronides, its salts and esters are named glucuronates. The human body uses glucuronidation to make alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, mercaptans, primary and secondary aliphatic amines, and carbamates more water-soluble, and, in this way, allows for their subsequent elimination from the body through urine or faeces (via bile from the liver) at a significantly increased rate. The carboxyl group is ionized at physiological pH, making the conjugated compound water-soluble. Compounds with molecular masses > 60,000 are too large for renal excretion and will be excreted with bile into the intestine. Neonates are deficient in this conjugating system, making them particularly vulnerable to drugs such as chloramphenicol, which is inactivated by the addition of glucuronic acid, resulting in gray baby syndrome. Bilirubin is excreted in the bile as bilirubin diglucuronide (80%), bilirubin glucuronide (20%), and unconjugated bilirubin (< 1%). In the Crigler‚ÄìNajjar syndrome and the Gilbert syndrome, UDPGT activity is reduced or nearly absent due to mutations, resulting in jaundice. It is possible to exhaust the bodies supply of glucuronic acid by combining multiple drugs/substances whose metabolism and excretion are primarily or entirely dependent on glucuronidation. Although most such substances have secondary metabolic routes which become prominent following GCA depletion, the rate of metabolism is reduced enough to produce a marked accumulation of all GCA substrates in the system; this often increases drug concentrations in the blood by medically relevant amounts. In the most severe cases permanent and debilitating organ damage (particularly the liver, kidneys, heart, and brain), and even death, have been known to occur. Ethanol, morphine, paracetamol (acetaminophen), cyclooxygenase inhibitors (NSAIDs), endogenous steroids, and certain benzodiazepines are all capable of contributing to GCA depletion, with ethanol and acetaminophen being the most commonly implicated substances involved in cases of accidental overdoses which have been positively attributed to glucuronic acid depletion. Excessive quantities of GCA can also be hazardous to health, tobacco smoke, most barbiturates, and some carbamates are known to actually stimulate GCA production. Increased GCA activity results in a decrease of the concentration and metabolic half-life of glucuronic acid substrates, causing the plasma levels of glucuronidated drugs to fall below their therapeutic threshold. Excessive glucuronidation of the substrates may result in an inadequate response to traditional doses of affected medications and, unless the drug has a very wide therapeutic index, will generally result in the acute failure of the pharmacotherapy and necessitate the transition of one or more implicated drugs to an equivalent regimen of non-glucuronidated alternatives. A select number of antidepressants and a wide range of anti-psychotic agents are glucuronidation ligands but due to their delayed mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic properties the decrease of their plasma concentrations may not be immediately apparent and tends to present as a sudden and intense relapse of symptoms instead of a gradual regression to the behaviors and thought patterns exhibited by the patient prior to the initiation of their pharmacological treatment. Glucuronides may be hydrolyzed by Œ≤-glucuronidase present in intestinal microflora to the respective aglycone, which may be reabsorbed from the intestine and translocated back to the liver with the blood. The resulting cycle is called enterohepatic circulation. Compounds that undergo enterohepatic circulation are only slowly excreted and usually have a longer half-life in the body. Certain glucuronides are electrophilic and may function in toxication processes. Covalent binding of the aglycone portions of several carboxylic acid (ester) glucuronides is known to occur to nucleophilic sites on serum albumin via transacylation reactions, for example. Phenols, quantitatively important P450-derived metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbons, are substrates for both UDP-GT and sulfotransferases. Glucuronides predominate with phenol or a phenol precursor (benzene) in mammals because sulfate formation is a high-affinity, low-capacity system (due to sulfate depletion), whereas glucuronidation is a low-affinity, high-capacity (although still exhaustible) system. =Role in disease= Glucuronic acid, as well as the glucuronidated metabolite of ethanol, ethyl glucuronide (ETG), act on toll- like receptor 4 to aggravate both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions as well as increasing the perceived severity of pain in patients with chronic pain conditions, via up-regulation of the production and release of endogenous inflammatory signaling molecules within the body. Long-term agonism of the TLR4 receptor (such as that which occurs from GCA, ETG, and opiates) results in chronically painful conditions being perceived as considerably more severe than they did previously while pre-existing tolerable yet occasionally painful activities can become more painful than before and will begin to be aggravated by briefer and less physically demanding activities. It can also cause equally painful responses to decreasingly noxious (irritating) stimuli, eventually resulting in considerable agony from stimuli which wouldn't cause any amount of pain to most individuals.  Use  Determination of urinary steroids and of steroid conjugates in blood. Ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate are excreted in urine as metabolites of ethanol and are used to monitor alcohol use or dependence. Glucuronic acid and gluconic acid are fermentation products in Kombucha tea. Glucuronic acid is a precursor of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, formerly called as L-hexuronic acid). Ascorbate can be biosynthesized by higher plants, algae, yeast and most animals. An adult goat produces ~13 g of vitamin C per day. This ability is lacking in some mammals (including humans and guinea pigs) and also in insects, invertebrates and most fishes. These species require external ascorbate supply, because they lack the biosynthetic enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase. The glucuronide 4-methylumbelliferyl-Œ≤-D- glucuronide (MUG) is used to test for the presence of Escherichia coli. E. coli produces the enzyme Œ≤-glucuronidase, which hydrolyzes the MUG molecule to a fluorescent product that is detectable under ultraviolet light.

Edmund Wilson  Wilson was an American literary critic and author. As a younger man Wilson sympathized with Communism, but came to be disillusioned the more closely he looked at the Soviet experiment. \\"By 1940 when he finally published his epic history of socialism, To the Finland Station, seven years in the making, he had completely repudiated Russian socialism.\\"  Stumbling into tax resistance  His tax resistance was strangely half-hearted and muddled, but he devoted a book to it. The way he tells the story, \\"Between the year 1946 and the year 1955, I did not file any income tax returns.\\" Not for any ideological or ethical reason, but because \\"I thought that this obligation could always be attended to later. I had no idea at that time of how heavy our taxation had become or of the severity of the penalties exacted for not filing tax returns.\\" Wilson finally sought out \\"an old friend of mine, an extremely able lawyer,\\" who told him that he was in danger of heavy fines and jail time and was in his opinion \\"in such a mess that he thought the best thing I could do was to become a citizen of some other country.\\" He instructed the lawyer instead to make out the returns for the years he had failed to file, along with a $9,000 down payment on whatever it was that he owed.  Income tax  Subsequent chapters tell of Wilson's struggles with what was already a labyrinthine and Kafkaesque Internal Revenue Service bureaucracy, which Wilson compares with those in the Soviet Union. The $9,000 he offers is laughably inadequate to pay what he owes, his fines, or even his eventual legal fees. His troubles lead him to investigate the history of the income tax in the United States, and to write extensively on how the assumptions the IRS makes about how and when people earn income map poorly to the actual way a literary man like Wilson makes a living. He dives into the tax code and discovers that \\"[t]he question of what ought to be taxed and how much and which deductions ought to be allowed has reached a point of fine-spun complexity that ‚Äî working in terms of a different set of values ‚Äî recalls the far-fetched distinctions of medieval theology.\\" And here what starts out looking like a literary man's attempt to squeeze some wry observations out of an unfortunate and na√Øve encounter with the government at its bureaucratic best starts to turn. Wilson takes a long, hard look at the federal government's budget and notices that huge hunks of it go to pay for wars past present and future and (this is 1963, remember) the program to put a man on the moon. After a brief detour to contrast the lunar project with a project he thinks underfunded and more valuable ‚Äî to publish collected editions of some of America's finest authors ‚Äî he dives a little deeper into the military budget.  Cold War  He's shocked and alarmed at the sums spent to fuel the arms race with the Soviet Union, and upset also at how enthusiastically his government pursues chemical, biological and nuclear weapons technology ‚Äî what now gets lumped under the \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" banner. He determines, finally, that: > When the stakes in games become so serious ‚Äî when everybody's life is at > stake ‚Äî they ought not to be played at all, and the taxpayers should not > support them. But the taxpayers do support them, and that is why we cannot > halt these activities. And later: > I have said that it was difficult to understand, in what we call our free > world, how it can come about that a scientist who has been working on CBR > [Chemical, Biological and Radiological weapons] but is dubious about the > morality of what he is doing should not find it in his power to resign. But > how free are we citizens of this free world to resign from the gigantic and > demented undertakings to which our government has got us committed? He makes also an interesting observation about how because of the importance of these problems, and because of the difficult and compelling moral demands they make on us, they have paradoxically disappeared from conversation ‚Äî a strategy similar to not talking about a family member's drinking problem in the hopes that this will make it as though it never existed in the first place: > [T]he United States, for all its so much advertised comforts, is today an > uncomfortable place. It is idle for our \\"leaders\\" and \\"liberals\\" to talk > about the necessity for Americans to recover their old idealism, to > consecrate themselves again to their mission of liberation. Our national > mission, if our budget proves anything, has taken on colossal dimensions, > but in its interference in foreign countries and its support of oppressive > regimes, it has hardly been a liberating mission, and the kind of idealism > involved is becoming insane and intolerant in the manner of the John Birch > Society. Even those who do not give much conscious thought to what has been > taking place are discouraged and blocked in their work or alienated from > their normal ambitions by the paralyzing chill of a national effort directed > toward a blind dead end which is all the more horrifying and haunting for > being totally inconsecutive with their daily lives and inapprehensible to > their imaginations. The accomplished, the intelligent, the well-informed go > on in their useful professions that require high integrity and intellect, > but they suffer more and more from the crowding of an often unavowed > constraint which may prevent them from allowing themselves to become too > intelligent and well-informed or may drive them to indulge their skills in > gratuitous and futile exercises. One notices in the conversation of this > professional class certain inhibitions on free expression, a tacit > understanding that certain matters had better not be brought into > discussion, which sometimes makes one feel in such talk a kind of > fundamental frivolity. Wilson then goes on to tell the stories of a few people who were unable to successfully silence the yelps of their own cognitive dissonance. He starts with the case of Major Claude Eatherly, who commanded the bomber group that dropped the atom bombs on Japan, capping 13 months of duty in World War II. Shortly afterwards, he became horrified by what he had done, and hopeless at the possibility of repenting for or earning forgiveness for willfully extinguishing so many lives and causing so much pain. He tried speaking out with pacifist groups, sending parts of his paycheck to Hiroshima, writing letters of apology, and at a couple of points attempted suicide. At one point \\"he set out to try to discredit the popular myth of the war hero [by] committing petty crimes from which he derived no benefit: he forged a check for a small amount and contributed the money to a fund for the children of Hiroshima. He held up banks and broke into post offices without ever taking anything.\\" Eatherly was confined to the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Waco, Texas, from which he wrote: > Whilst in no sense, I hope, either a religious or a political fanatic, I > have for some time felt convinced that the crisis in which we are all > involved is one calling for a thorough re-examination of our whole scheme of > values and of loyalties. In the past it has sometimes been possible for men > to \\"coast along\\" without posing to themselves too many searching questions > about the way they are accustomed to think and to act ‚Äî but it is reasonably > clear that our age is not one of these. On the contrary, I believe that we > are rapidly approaching a situation in which we shall be compelled to re- > examine our willingness to surrender responsibility for our thoughts and our > actions to some social institution such as the political party, trade union, > church or State. None of these institutions are adequately equipped to offer > infallible advice on moral issues and their claim to offer such advice needs > therefore to be challenged.  Go on strike?  \\"Now, how is one to struggle against this situation?\\" asks Wilson. \\"Go on strike and refuse to pay taxes?\\" And much of the remainder of the book is devoted to people who decided to do just that, like Dr. A.J. Muste, Eroseanna Robinson, Walter Gormly, and Rev. Maurice McCrackin, all of whom confronted the IRS directly and bore the brunt of its most vigorous enforcement efforts. Wilson ends by asking: \\"And what is the author of this protest to do?\\" > I am not going to let myself be sent to Leavenworth, as Dr. McCrackin was. I > have thought of establishing myself in a foreign country as my lawyer friend > suggested and as I thought him rather absurd for suggesting. I do feel that > I must not violate the agreement I have signed with the government to > surrender for three years longer all the income that I take in above a > certain taxable amount. My original delinquency was due not to principle but > to negligence; but I now grudge every penny of the imposition, and I intend > to outmaneuver this agreement, as well as the basic taxes themselves by > making as little money as possible and so keeping below taxable levels. I > have always thought myself patriotic and have been in the habit in the past > of favorably contrasting the United States with Europe and the Soviet Union; > but our country has become today a huge blundering power unit controlled > more and more by bureaucracies whose rule is making it more and more > difficult to carry on the tradition of American individualism; and since I > can accept neither this power unit's aims nor the methods it employs to > finance them, I have finally come to feel that this country, whether or not > I continue to live in it, is no longer any place for me. According to Wilson biographer Lewis M. Dabney, Wilson transferred the copyright for the book \\"to A.J. Muste's magazine Liberation.\\"  Aftermath  Wilson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the same year that The Cold War and the Income Tax was published. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. writes that President Kennedy: > ‚Ä¶himself added Edmund Wilson's name to the list in 1963. (Knowing Wilson's > dislike of honors on principle, I called him to see whether he would accept > the Medal. He said that he would be greatly pleased to do so, but that the > President should know he was writing a pamphlet attacking the income tax and > the defense budget. It was not, he said, directed so much against the > Kennedy administration, parts of which he much admired, as against > governments in general; still the President ought to know about it, and he > would understand if we decided not to go ahead with the presentation. When I > reported this to Kennedy, he smiled and said that he didn't think it would > make any difference.) Lewis M. Dabney, in Edmund Wilson: A Life in Literature, adds to this account: > [Wilson] stipulated that the president had to be made aware of his pamphlet > and sent the text to Schlesinger, who passed on a summary. When a man named > Bacon from the IRS brought in a memorandum opposing the award ‚Äî parts of it > paralleling the ever expanding FBI file on Wilson ‚Äî Schlesinger and Theodore > Sorensen each remembered that Kennedy decisively stated, \\"This is not an > award for good conduct but for literary merit. Phyllis Schlafly attacked this awarding of the Medal of Freedom to Wilson in her 1964 book A Choice, Not an Echo. In his book Intellectuals, historian Paul Johnson shows little sympathy for Wilson's tax troubles: > They had given him a frightening insight into the harshness of the modern > state at its most belligerent ‚Äî the tax-gathering role ‚Äî but this should > have come as no surprise to an imaginative man who had made it his business > to study the state in theory and in practice. The person who is in the > weakest position to attack the state is he who has largely ignored its > potential for evil while strongly backing its expansion on humanitarian > grounds and is only stirred to protest when he falls foul of it through his > own negligence. That exactly describes Wilson's position. In his book he > tried to evade his own inconsistencies by arguing that most of his income > tax went on defence spending induced by Cold War paranoia. But then he had > not paid his state income taxes either, and they did not go on defence. Nor > did he meet the point that, by the time he settled, a rapidly rising > proportion of federal income tax was going on welfare. Was it morally > justifiable to evade that too? In short, the book shows Wilson at his worst > and makes one grateful that, in general, he ceased being a political > intellectual by the time he was forty. Dabney writes that Wilson's tax troubles continued for the rest of his life, and beyond: > The fight with the IRS‚Ä¶ dragged on into the [Kennedy] administration, the > agency never quite ready to compromise.‚Ä¶ Elena [Wilson] began appealing to > Schlesinger at the White House. Commissioner Mortimer Caplin was asked to > produce a settlement, and the government eventually agreed to $25,000, > though continuing to insist on a $30,000 collateral agreement against future > earnings. Wilson would die in debt‚Ä¶ for the money with which he paid this > off, and Elena had to justify all the medical expenses of his last decade to > auditors. She would be submitting detailed accounts in the year of her > death, seven years after her husband's.

Biography Snieƒçkus was born in 1903, in the village of B≈´bleliai, near ≈†akiai. During the First World War, his family fled to Russia where he observed the Russian revolution of 1917. In 1919, his family returned to Lithuania; by 1920 he was already a member of the Bolshevik Party. In the same year, he was arrested for anti-government activities. He was released from prison on bail, but fled to Moscow, and became an agent of the Comintern. In Moscow, he earned the trust of Zigmas Angarietis and Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas, and became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania. In 1926, the Comintern sent Snieƒçkus to Lithuania to replace the recently executed Karolis Po≈æƒóla as head of the banned and underground Communist Party of Lithuania.Audronƒó Urbonaitƒó. Antano Snieƒçkaus mitas (Myth of Antanas Snieƒçkus), Ekstra, 6 January 2002, No.1 (213) From 1926 to 1930, he engaged in subversive activities in Lithuania, and was again arrested and imprisoned for them in Kaunas Prison in 1930. Vytautas Tininis. Snieƒçkus 33 metai vald≈æioje (Snieƒçkus 33 Years in Power). Vilnius, 2000 In 1933, Snieƒçkus was released in exchange for Lithuanian political prisoners held in the USSR. In 1936, he returned to Lithuania. In 1939, he was arrested again, and sentenced to eight years in prison. After the 1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania and subsequent military occupation, Snieƒçkus was released from prison on 18 June 1940, and became the head of the Department of National Security. Foreign Affairs Commissar Vladimir Dekanozov, arrived in Lithuania a few days earlier on 15 June, to organize the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. As party secretary, Snieƒçkus issued Vladimir Dekanozov‚Äôs orders in the party‚Äôs name. Snieƒçkus helped create an atmosphere of terror prior to the elections of the newly established, by the Soviet authorities, People's Seimas, on 14 July. Only the Communist Party of Lithuania and its collaborators could nominate candidates. People were threatened in various ways to participate in the elections, but the results were falsified anyway. On 21 July, the People's Seimas, declared that the Lithuanian \\"people\\" wanted to join the Soviet Union, and on 3 August, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR annexed Lithuania into the Soviet Union. The illegal process of annexation was formally over and the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was created. From 15 August, until his death, Snieƒçkus was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania. Snieƒçkus was the initiator of the first mass deportations of Lithuanians on 14‚Äì19 June 1941. He even had his own brother, with his family, deported to Siberia, where his brother died. On 26 November 1942, the Lithuanian Partisan Movement (Lietuvos partizaninio judƒójimo ≈°tabas) was created in Moscow, under the command of Snieƒçkus, who had retreated with the Red Army to Moscow, in 1941. The existence of the Command of Lithuanian Partisan Movement had to show the Lithuanian nature of Soviet partisans actions in Lithuania, but in reality groups of saboteurs sent from Moscow did not report to the Command of Lithuanian Partisan Movement and instead reported directly to the Central Command of the Partisan Movement. It is estimated that in Lithuania 5‚Äî10 thousand people engaged in Soviet underground activities during the war.Audronƒó Janaviƒçienƒó Soviet Saboteurs in Lithuania (1941-1944), 2004 I. Altman Holocaust and Jewish Resistance in the Occupied Soviet Territories In 1944, due to the advance of the Red Army, his mother fled Lithuania to the West, and disowned her son. Two brothers and three sisters of Antanas Snieƒçkus also fled to the West. Snieƒçkus returned from Russia in 1944 with the Communist officials who had retreated during the German invasion of 22 June 1941. Snieƒçkus again organized mass deportations of Lithuanians following the war. In 1948, Snieƒçkus started the collectivisation of agriculture. Most peasants were collectivised by 1952 through terror, killings and deportations. Agricultural production fell dramatically to the level of Soviet agriculture in the other Soviet Republics.

Revolution Day celebrations in 1970. During the later decades of Snieƒçkus's rule national orientation was noticeable in his activities. First confrontation with Moscow happened in 1949-1950, when he had to defend his old communist friends from persecution, with whom he was together working in underground. Lithuania was the only republic of USSR where not only mass persecution of old communists did not happen and not even one communist of pre-Soviet times was accused and arrested. At around this time his policies started to gain a national character. This policy had the form of sabotaging some orders of Moscow, demanding some privileges for Lithuania, and others. His wife Mira Bordonaitƒó was also a convinced communist and spent many years in prison. Snieƒçkus had two children, Vladas and Marytƒó. After his death Snieƒçkus, a village for employees of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant on the shores of Lake Dr≈´k≈°iai, was founded in 1975. In 1992 the town was renamed Visaginas and in 1995 received city rights. Some attempts have been made in Lithuania to rehabilitate Snieƒçkus, who was more or less successfully mythologized throughout several decades.

Career Prior to joining Nokia, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo held a variety of positions with the former Union Bank of Finland. Kallasvuo's involvement with Nokia began in 1980 when he was appointed as Corporate Counsel. In 1987 he was appointed Assistant Vice President, Legal Department, and in 1988 he was named Assistant Vice President, Finance. In 1990 he was promoted to Senior Vice President, Finance.

During this period, Nokia's management failed to respond to the rapidly changing environment of the smartphone and wider mobile market, with the lack of platform and UI development contributing to the decline. The slow pace of development and weak support of the company's own Maemo OS, subsequently known as Meego and featured on the N900 and N9 handsets, left the company with no platform to compete with Apple's iPhone or Google's Android platforms, with key partner Intel abandoning the Meego project in 2011 shortly after Kallasvuo's departure from Nokia. Kallasvuo's successor, Elop, turned to the Windows Phone platform with little commercial success and Nokia fell from the world's largest mobile manufacturer to a minor brand with less than 3% of the smartphone market when its mobile phone division was bought out by Microsoft in mid 2014. Kallasvuo meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 26 June 2008 In addition to his duties for Nokia he served as Director of EMC Corporation from August 2004 to 23 January 2009. On 26 January 2012 the TeliaSonera committee proposed that Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo be elected as a new member of the TeliaSonera's board of directors. In January 2013, it was announced that Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was the new Chairman of the board for Zenterio AB, a Swedish TV software company. Zenterio AB declared bankruptcy in July 2019 and in February 2020, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was sued in court for the amount of 44 million Swedish crowns for his actions as Chairman of Zenterio. Education Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo holds a master's degree in law (LL.M.) from the University of Helsinki. Personal life Kallasvuo was born in Lavia, Finland.

The lawsuit named Langone who had approved the pay package. Langone denied that the pay packages were illegal considering that the NYSE had direct knowledge of the boards decision. On July 1, 2008, the New York State Court of Appeals dismissed all claims against Grasso because the NYSE had changed its status from a nonprofit to a for-profit organization, which meant that the Attorney General had lost standing to sue Grasso.

Several members of the neo-fascist terrorist organization (NAR, Armed Revolutionary Nuclei) were sentenced for the bombing,Tassinari, 2008, p. 626. although the group denied involvement.  Events  Bystanders assisting the rescue operation Rescuers carrying a victim At 10:25 CEST, a time bomb hidden in an unattended suitcase detonated in an air-conditioned waiting room at the Bologna station, which was full of people seeking relief from the August heat. The explosion collapsed the roof of the waiting room, destroyed most of the main building, and hit the Ancona‚ÄìChiasso train which was waiting at the first platform. The station was full of tourists that Saturday, and the city was unprepared for a major disaster. Many passers-by and travelers provided first aid to victims and helped rescue people who were buried under the rubble. Due to the large number of casualties and an insufficient number of emergency vehicles available to transport the injured to hospitals, firefighters used buses, private cars, and taxis. Some doctors and hospital staff returned early from vacation to care for the victims, and hospital departments which were closed for the summer holidays were reopened to accommodate the casualties. After the attack, large demonstrations were held in Piazza Maggiore (Bologna's central square). Harsh criticism was directed at government representatives who attended the 6 August funerals of the victims in the Basilica San Petronio. The only applause was reserved for President Sandro Pertini, who arrived by helicopter in Bologna at 5:30 pm the day of the massacre and tearfully said: \\"I have no words; we are facing the most criminal enterprise that has ever taken place in Italy.\\"La storia d'Italia, Vol. 23, Dagli anni di piombo agli anni 80, Torino, 2005, pag. 587 The #37 bus (used to transport victims) and the clock (stopped at 10:25) were symbols of the massacre. The attack was the worst atrocity in Italy since World War II.Davies, Peter, Jackson, Paul (2008). The far right in Europe: an encyclopedia. Greenwood World Press, p. 238.  Investigation  The government, led by Christian Democratic Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga, first assumed that the incident was due to an accidental explosion of an old boiler in the station's basement. Evidence, however, soon pointed to terrorism. L'Unit√†, the Italian Communist Party (PCI) newspaper, attributed responsibility for the attack to neo-fascists on 3 August. Later, in a special session of the Senate, Cossiga also supported the theory that neo-fascists were behind the attack: \\"Unlike leftist terrorism, which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives, right-wing terrorism prefers acts such as massacres because acts of extreme violence promote panic and impulsive reactions.\\" The bomb was later found to be composed of of explosives: of TNT and Composition B and of T4 (nitroglycerin for civil use).Carlo Lucarelli, Blu notte La strage di Bologna . = False leads = Shortly after the bombing, the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata press agency received a call from an individual claiming to represent NAR and claiming responsibility. The call later proved fake, originating instead from the Florence office of SISMI (the Italian Military Secret Service). Federigo Manucci Benincasa, the director of SISMI's Florence branch, was later charged with obstruction of justice. A Lebanese connection was manufactured in September 1980 involving Al Fatah, Phalangists, Italian radicals and Swiss journalists tied to the Italian intelligence community, who supplied investigators with fake notes, memos, and reports. This was followed by a KGB connection concocted by intelligence head General Giuseppe Santovito, a member of P2, and Francesco Pazienza. Generals Pietro Musumeci, another member of P2, and Belmonte of SISMI had a police sergeant put a suitcase full of similar explosives on a train in Bologna. The suitcase also contained personal items belonging to two right-wing extremists, a Frenchman, and a German. Musumeci also produced a phony dossier, entitled \\"Terror on trains\\". He was charged with falsifying evidence to incriminate Roberto Fiore and Gabriele Adinolfi, two leaders of the far-right Terza Posizione who had fled to London.Ren√© Monzat, Enqu√™tes sur la droite extr√™me, Le Monde-√©ditions, 1992, p. 89. Both Terza Posizione leaders said that Musumeci was trying to divert attention from P2 head Licio Gelli. Musumeci and Belmonte were convicted of obstructing the investigation.  Prosecution  The attack has been attributed to the NAR (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), a neo- fascist terrorist organization. A long, controversial court case began after the bombing. Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti were sentenced to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Luigi Ciavardini, a NAR member with close ties to Terza Posizione, in April 2007. Ciavardini received a 30-year prison sentence for his role in the attack. He had been arrested after the armed robbery of the Banca Unicredito di Roma on 15 September 2005.\\"Strage di Bologna, 30 anni a Ciavardini‚ÄîCassazione conferma la condanna all'ex Nar\\", la Repubblica, 11 April 2007 .\\"Arrestato l'estremista nero Ciavardini per una rapina a mano armata\\", la Repubblica, 10 October 2006 . Ciavardini was also charged with the assassinations of Francesco Evangelista on 28 May 1980 and Judge Mario Amato on 23 June 1980. On 26 August 1980, the prosecutor of Bologna issued twenty-eight arrest warrants for far-right militants of the NAR and Terza Posizione. Among those arrested were Massimo Morsello (future founder of the neo-fascist organization and political party Forza Nuova), Francesca Mambro, Aldo Semerari, Maurizio Neri, and Paolo Signorelli. They were interrogated in Ferrara, Rome, Padua, and Parma. All were released from prison in 1981. The first trial began in Bologna on 9 March 1987. Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco, Roberto Rinani and Paolo Signorelli were charged with murder. Gilberto Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Egidio Giuliani, Marcello Iannilli, Mambro, Giovanni Melioli, Picciafuoco, Roberto Raho, Rinani and Signorelli were charged with forming an armed gang. Marco Ballan, Giuseppe Belmonte, Fabio De Felice, Stefano Delle Chiaie, Fachini, Licio Gelli, Maurizio Giorgi, Pietro Musumeci, Francesco Pazienza, Signorelli and Adriano Tilgher were charged with subversive association. Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were charged with defamation.Sergio Zavoli, La notte della Repubblica, Nuova Eri, 1992 . On 11 July 1988, Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Picciafuoco were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; Rinani and Signorelli were acquitted. Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Giuliani, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli were convicted of forming an armed gang; Iannilli, Melioli and Raho were acquitted. Ballan, Belmonte, Felice, Delle Chiaie, Fachini, Gelli, Giorgi, Musumeci, Pazienza, Signorelli and Tilgher were acquitted of subversive association. Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were convicted of defamation. The appeal process began on 25 October 1989. On appeal, Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli were acquitted of murder on 18 July 1990. Cavallini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Giuliani were convicted of forming an armed gang. Belmonte and Musumeci were convicted of defamation, and the other defendants were acquitted. On 12 February 1992, the Supreme Court of Cassation acquitted Rinani and Signorelli of murder; Signorelli was also acquitted of forming an armed gang and subversive association. The court also acquitted other defendants, canceled the judgment and ordered a new trial because the sentences were \\"illogical, incoherent, not assessing proofs and evidence in good terms, not taking into account the facts preceding and following the event, unmotivated or poorly motivated, in some parts the judges supporting unlikely arguments that not even the defense had argued\\". The new trial began on 11 October 1993. Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro and Sergio Picciafuoco were charged with murder; Gilberto Cavallini, Massimiliano Fachini, Egidio Giuliani, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco and Roberto Rinani were charged with forming an armed gang, and Giuseppe Belmonte, Licio Gelli, Pietro Musumeci, and Francesco Pazienza were charged with defamation. On 16 May 1994, Fioravanti, Mambro and Picciafuoco were sentenced to life imprisonment; Fachini was acquitted. Cavallini, Fioravanti, Giuliani, Mambro and Picciafuoco were convicted of forming an armed gang; Fachini and Rinani were acquitted. Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were convicted of defamation. On 23 November 1995: The Supreme Court upheld Fioravanti, Mambro, Gelli, Pazienza, Musumeci and Belmonte's convictions, ordering a new trial for Picciafuoco (who was acquitted by the Appeals Court in Florence on 18 June 1996, a verdict upheld by the Supreme Court on 15 April 1997). In April 1998, Mambro was given home confinement and allowed to leave prison during the day.Anne Hanley, \\"Bologna bomber slips back into society\\", The Independent, 16 April 1998 on-line . In June 2000, Massimo Carminati (NAR member), Ivano Bongiovanni (far-right sympathizer) and Federigo Manucci Benincasa (SISMI officer) were convicted of obstruction. Carminati and Manucci Benincasa were acquitted for lack of evidence in December 2001, and Bongiovanni's conviction was upheld. On 30 January 2003, the Court of Cassation finally acquitted Carminati and Manucci Benincasa.  Alternate theories  Funerals of the victims As a result of protracted legal procedures and false leads, a number of theories were proposed during the years after the attack. Involvement by Italian Secret Service officials was suggested. Between 1999 and 2006, during sessions of the parliamentary commission established to probe terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify those responsible for the massacre and a commission investigating the Mitrokhin dossier and Italian intelligence activity, new information emerged on international terrorist networks and Italian intelligence in the former Soviet bloc and Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen and Iraq. Secret agreements with the Palestinian leadership tied to arms trafficking between the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Italy and a warning to the Italian anti- terrorist secret service three weeks before the massacre were discovered. Thomas Kram, member of a German terrorist group linked to Carlos the Jackal and the Palestinians, was in Bologna on the day of the massacre. On 17 November 2005, the Bologna prosecutor opened a case (Dossier 7823/2005 RG) against unknown persons.Dossier. According to media reports in 2004 and 2007,\\"Il giallo della strage di Bologna. Ecco le prove della pista araba\\", il Giornale, 22 October 2007 . Francesco Cossiga suggested Palestinian involvement in a letter to Enzo Fragal√† of the Mitrokhin Commission.\\"Strage Bologna: Cossiga, forse atto del terrorismo arabo\\". . In 2005, Carlos the Jackal said that \\"the Mitrokhin Commission attempts to falsify history\\" and \\"they were the CIA and the Mossad to hit in Bologna\\" with the intent to punish Italy for its relationship with the PLO.\\"A Bologna a colpire furono Cia e Mossad. Carlos: utilizzati giovani neofascisti, per√≤ per me Mambro e Fioravanti sono innocenti\\", Corriere della Sera, 23 November 2005 . After the 2006 arrest of former Argentine Triple A member Rodolfo Almir√≥n, Spanish lawyer Jos√© Angel P√©rez Nievas declared that it was \\"probable that Almir√≥n participated‚Äîalong with Stefano Delle Chiaie and Augusto Cauchi‚Äîin the 1980 bombing in Bologna's train station\\". In 1998, the Supreme Court of Argentina refused to extradite Cauchi to Italy.\\"Denuncian que Almir√≥n tambi√©n particip√≥ en la ultraderecha espa√±ola\\". , Telam Argentine news agency, 6 January 2007 . In May 2007, Massimo Sparti's son said: \\"My father has always lied about the Bologna investigation\\". \\"Strage di Bologna. Parla il figlio di Sparti, testimone chiave dell'accusa: 'Mio padre ha sempre mentito', Il Sole 24 Ore, 24 May 2007 . During a 2008 BBC interview, former Italian president Francesco Cossiga reaffirmed his belief that the massacre was attributable to Palestinian resistance groups operating in Italy (rather than fascist black terrorism) and in the innocence of Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti.\\"La strage di Bologna, fu un incidente della resistenza palestinese\\", Corriere della Sera, 8 July 2008 .\\"Our World: The convenient war against the Jews\\". , The Jerusalem Post, 6 October 2008. The PFLP has always denied responsibility.\\"Former Italian Prime Minister fabricates lies against the Palestinian people\\". , Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. On 19 August 2011, the Bologna prosecutor began an investigation of two German terrorists: Thomas Kram and Christa Margot Fr√∂hlich, both linked to Carlos the Jackal's group and in Bologna on the day of the attack.\\"Svolta sulla strage del Due Agosto Indagati due terroristi tedeschi\\", la Repubblica, 19 August 2011 .  Legacy  Relatives of the victims formed the Associazione dei familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980 on 1 June 1981 to raise and maintain awareness of the bombing. The group, which began with 44 members, grew to 300. On 6 April 1983, the association and victims' associations of victims of the Piazza Fontana, Piazza della Loggia and Italicus Express bombings formed the Union of Relatives of Victims to Massacres (Unione dei Familiari delle Vittime per Stragi) in Milan.The Association was responsible, together with other associations of victims of massacres the publication of the book entitled Il terrorismo e le sue maschere published by Pendragon in Bologna Plaque at the Bologna Central Station The clock at Bologna Centrale railway station was permanently fixed at 10:25 to commemorate the massacre. Bologna and the Associazione tra i familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980 sponsor an annual international composition competition which ends with a concert in Piazza Maggiore on 2 August, a national memorial day for all terrorist massacres. Although the damaged part of the station has been mostly reconstructed, the original floor tile pierced by the detonation has been left in place and a deep crack (covered by a glass panel) has been left in the reconstructed main wall. The station clock was stopped at 10:25, the time of the explosion, in 1996. In February and July 2020 (Part I of 2), the Italian weekly L'Espresso published a reportage that demonstrated the couple Licio Gelli-Umberto Ortolani financed the terrorists of the slaughter and subsequently took care of the necessary red herrings thanks to the support of Federico Umberto D'Amato.  In popular culture  The bombing is the backdrop of a chapter of Laurent Binet's '. The 2017 French novel, which satirizes late-20th-century Parisian intellectual and political life, involves two detectives investigating what they assume to be the murder of the philosopher Roland Barthes. The detectives, who travel to Bologna to interview Umberto Eco, narrowly escape injury in the attack.

It was used by Confederate cavalrymen during the U.S. Civil War. Seven of these revolvers were held by the New Zealand Colonial Defence Force in 1863 and were issued to the famous Forest Rangers at the start of the campaign to push Maori rebels out of the Auckland province. It is easily recognized by its side-mounted hammer. History James Kerr had been the foreman for the Deane, Adams and Deane gun factory. Robert Adams, one of the partners and inventor of the Adams revolver, was Kerr's cousin. Kerr developed an improvement to the Adams revolver, British Patent No. 1722 of July 28, 1855, and when Adams left the Deane brothers to found the London Armoury Company on February 9, 1856, Kerr went with him. The London Armoury Company manufactured military rifles and revolvers. Kerr designed rifles for the company based on the 1853 pattern Enfield rifled musket. When the company directors decided to focus on rifle production in 1859 Adams left, taking his revolver patents with him. Kerr designed a new revolver in .36 caliber and .44 caliber (54 bore in British measurement). Production began in April 1859. The British government did not initially purchase the weapon and civilian sales were modest. All the New Zealand revolvers were 54 bore(gauge)or .44 calibre.Forest Rangers.R Stowers.Hamilton 1996. However, the U.S. Civil War began in 1860 and the governments of both the United States and the Confederacy began purchasing arms in Britain. In November 1861, 1,600 revolvers were purchased for the Union army, at $18.00 apiece. However Confederate arms buyers Maj. Caleb Huse and Cpt. James D. Bulloch contracted for all the rifles and revolvers the Armoury could produce (and the Confederate government could pay for). As a result, the London Armoury Company became a major arms supplier to the Confederacy, selling the most of the 11,000 Kerr revolvers produced to Huse. The Kerr revolvers sold to the Confederacy were said by William Edwards in his book Civil War Guns to be those between serial numbers 3,000 and 10,000, but earlier serial numbers are thought by collectors to have also been shipped to the South, and there are no good records to show the exact number sold to the Confederate buyers. As with all Confederate imports from England (and Europe), these weapons had to pass through the Union blockade and the number that actually reached the Confederate army is unknown. Modern writers often state that the Confederates acclaimed the London Armoury Company's guns (which would include the first-class model 1853 rifle-muskets on the Enfield pattern) as the best weapons delivered to the Confederacy. The London Armoury Company supplied more revolvers to the Confederacy than the total produced by all the efforts of Southern manufacturers to make revolvers. As the Civil War progressed, the London Armoury Company was almost completely dependent on sales to the Confederacy and survived for only a year after the end of the war, dissolving in the Spring of 1866. Operation The Kerr Revolver featured a side-mounted hammer on a back-action lockplate. Unlike other revolvers of the day, the lock mechanism of the Kerr revolver was identical to that of back-action rifle and single shot pistol percussion locks of the time. The simple action was designed to be easily repairable in the field without requiring model-specific spare parts. The Kerr had a top strap over the cylinder, which is held in place by a pin that runs into the back of the frame below the hammer. The pistol is 12.25 inches overall with a barrel length of about 5 inches. Nearly all were made in .44, or \\"54 bore\\", caliber; a few in the smaller .36 caliber. The Kerr is often described as a double-action revolver. That is true as to only the earliest Kerrs produced, but all the later production were of the simpler single-action mechanism. With this simpler single-action type, the hammer must be manually pulled back until it locks in the full cock position. This cocking action causes the cylinder to revolve, thus bringing a fresh chamber into line with the barrel. Once the hammer has been cocked and locked back, the user must pull the trigger to cause the hammer to fall, striking the percussion cap over the chamber and firing the weapon. If the hammer is left down, and the trigger is pulled back, the cylinder will revolve, but the hammer will not be cocked back, as would be the case with true double-action revolver. The term \\"single action\\" means that the pulling of the trigger has only one effect‚Äîit releases the cocked hammer. In a \\"double-action\\" revolver, the pulling of the trigger has two effects‚Äîit caused the hammer to cock back, and then as the trigger pull is continued, it releases the hammer. The double-action mechanism in the early Kerrs was more complicated to manufacture and to keep in good adjustment and repair, and was early on dropped in favor of the simpler single-action mechanism. The London Armoury Company manufactured Kerrs have engraved on the side of the frame \\"KERRS PATENT.xxxx\\" with the xxxx representing a number. This is the serial number of the gun, and not the patent number. This serial number is also on the side of the cylinder. Mistaking this serial number for a patent number is an error often repeated from Edwards,Civil War Guns, by many writers. This same serial numbering convention used on the Kerr was used on the Adams Revolver (made by the London Armoury Company, among others), and also is seen on Samuel Colt's percussion revolvers of all models, where the serial number of each revolver (stamped on various places on the Colt revolver) was stamped on the cylinder following the words \\"COLTS PATENT No. \\" On the Kerr Revolvers, as with the Adams and Colts, these numbers are sequential and are serial numbers and not the patent number.

He was the brother-in-law of George Armstrong Custer and was killed along with Custer in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. His brother-in-law Myles Moylan survived the battle as part of the forces with Major Marcus Reno and Captain Frederick Benteen. Early life Calhoun was born in Cincinnati, Ohio into a prestigious and wealthy Scottish-American merchant family that included his brother Frederick. When the American Civil War broke out, he was travelling in Europe and two years later, both joined the Union army. Both brothers were to forgo the merchant life for the frontier to the dismay of their parents.Jefferson County Library History Rescue, \\"The Story of the Calhoun Family and General Armstrong Custer\\" Career Upon returning to the United States, he enlisted in the Union Army in 1864. By the end of the war, he was a Sergeant. In July 1867, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry. He met Margaret Custer while she was visiting the Custers in 1870, and they fell in love. His soon to be brother-in-law George Armstrong Custer had him appointed to first lieutenant in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, assigned to Company C. Personal life Calhoun was known as \\"The Adonis of the Seventh\\" due to his handsome features. He was part of the so-called \\"Custer Clan,\\" which was a clique of close-knit relatives and friends of the former Civil War general. Calhoun was also the brother-in-law of fellow Clan member Myles Moylan. He often wrote letters to his brother and to Margaret, or Maggie as she was called, writing with disdain of his limited understanding of complex native culture, adherents to which naturally resisted military conquest. He often referred to them as \\"heathens\\" and desired that one day a post-agricultural population explosion would make hunting-gathering lifestyles unsustainable in the face of Western society. Death At the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory during the Black Hills War, he was acting as temporary commander of L Company, whose commander was on detached service as aide to General Philip H. Sheridan, and killed along with most of the company. Evidence at the hill where he died, later known as Calhoun Hill, showed that he and his men fought fiercely before they were killed. He and his second in command, Lt. John Crittenden, were found within feet of each other and their men initially had been deployed in a defensive perimeter on the hill. His remains were initially buried on the battlefield, but were reinterred in Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1877.Fort Leavenworth A marble slab on the Little Bighorn battlefield marks the place where his body was discovered and initially buried.

Adam Kraft (or Krafft) (c. 1460?January 1509) was a German stone sculptor and master builder of the late Gothic period, based in Nuremberg and with a documented career there from 1490. It is not known where Kraft was born and raised; his hand has been claimed to be evident as an assistant in works in Ulm Minster (completed 1471) and the pulpit at Strasbourg Cathedral, completed in 1485.Kahnsnitz, Rainer, in Schultz, Ellen (ed). (1986) Gothic and Renaissance Art in Nuremberg. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 70. Kraft is believed to have married twice, but is not known to have produced any children. All his known works are in stone, but he may also have carved unidentified pieces in wood. His masterpiece is considered to be the tall tabernacle at St. Lorenz, Nuremberg. The tabernacle, that has the shape of a gothic tower reaching into the church's vault, is made up of tracery interspersed with figural scenes from Christ's Passion and was commissioned in 1493 by Hans Imhoff, a patrician from Nuremberg. The contract for the commission was preserved and stipulates details about the execution and finish of the work.Nash, Susie (2008) Northern Renaissance Art. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 149. The stone tower, which is supported by three figures, was lightly damaged during World War II and restored afterwards. One of the supporting figures is a self-portrait by Kraft (at right). Another important work is a huge relief of 1490-92 depicting the Crucifixion, Entombment of Christ, and Resurrection of Christ, on the exterior of St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremberg. Kraft is believed to have completed all of his sculpting work in Nuremberg and its environs in Bavaria, between the years 1490 and 1509, working with only a small complement of two or three assistants. His other significant works were the monumental reliefs in the various churches in Nuremberg. He produced the great Schreyer monument in 1492 for St. Sebaldus Church and Christ bearing the Cross above the altar of the same church. He also made various works for public and private buildings, such as the relief over the door of the Wagehaus, a Saint George and the Dragon, several Madonna (art)s, and other purely decorative pieces. The great tabernacle, covered in statuettes, in Ulm Minster, and the very spirited Stations of the Cross, on the road to the Nuremberg cemetery, are also his. He is buried in nearby Schwabach. Many of his pieces are exhibited at the Nuremberg museum, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum. Notes References *Schleif, Corine. ‚ÄúDoes Religion Matter?

As a result, Saddar contains the large concentration of colonial-era architecture in Karachi. History Empress Market in 1890 Saddar was established by the British in 1839 as a commercial district for Karachi's European population, to the east of the bazaars of old Karachi in Mithadar, Kharadar, and Jodia Bazaar which served the native population. Following the annexation of Sindh in 1843, Saddar became the location of administrative and military functions. Following the Mutiny of 1857, rebels were executed at by being blown from the mouths of cannons at Saddar's military parade grounds. Karachi's most elite Catholic institutions were quickly established in Karachi: St Patrick‚Äôs High School and St Joseph‚Äôs Convent High School, wereset up in 1861 and 1862 respectively. The Edulji Dinshaw Dispensary was established in 1882. The \\"McKenzie Pavilion Grounds\\", now known as Jehangir Park, was established in 1883. Empress Market was established at the site of the execution grounds in 1889, and was originally meant to serve British administrators, soldiers, and their families. The area around the market saw the establishment of posh bars, cafes, and restaurants, such as the Saddar Tea Rooms, Elphinstone Restaurant, the old Todi shop and Caf√© Parisian. A dress- code was enforced in the posh Saddar area, leading it to be eventually known as the \\"European Quarter\\" of Karachi. Following independence in 1947, Saddar remained a centre of multi-class interaction. Bars, clubs, and business catering to different social classes co-existed in the area. Several institutions of higher learning were within walking distance, including D. J. Sindh Government Science College, and Sindh Muslim Law College, and Regal Bazar became home to a weekly book market that still takes place. Saddar was also within easy walking distance from government institutions to the east of Saddar, and Civil Lines to the south. The most important churches in Karachi are located in Saddar, as well as Karachi's biggest Parsi fire temple. Following the abolishment of alcohol by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the early 1970s in an attempt to appease conservative forces, Saddar's nightlife scene was decimated. In 1977, dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq instituted an Islamization agenda that was opposed by the city's wealthy and westernized elite. These classes withdrew from much of public life in Saddar, and instead established exclusive social clubs in Karachi's wealthy residential districts. As a result, Saddar's commercial markets began to serve only lower and lower-middle classes. The area remained a large commuter hub, and so hawker stalls began encroaching on sidewalks in order to cater to the growing number of commuters. A large multiplex cinema was established in the early 2000s, leading to a small wave of gentrification in the area. In 2019, in an effort to \\"clean up\\" the Empress Market, all stalls outside of the market which had been established in the plaza around the market were demolished in a controversial move.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Florida / Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Cleveland Indians. Ram√≠rez is a three-time MLB All-Star, and received the 2006 National League Rookie of the Year Award. While he played the majority of his career at shortstop, he also played first base, third base and left field. Ram√≠rez established himself as an elite threat at the plate over his prime years, with a high career batting average (.289) and a high isolated power (.197). However, he was rated a poor defensive shortstop, which is why when he returned to the Red Sox the team played him in left field for the first time in his career, with even poorer results. For the 2016 season, he was switched to the first base position, a move that yielded good results both offensively and defensively. His hitting declined in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as he had the lowest batting averages and the lowest OPS of his MLB career. Early life Ram√≠rez was born in Saman√°, Dominican Republic, to Toribio and Isabela Ram√≠rez. His father was an auto mechanic. At an early age, Ram√≠rez was an avid baseball fan. He was also known as a basketball player. He attended Adventista High School in Saman√°, and attracted the attention of MLB scouts. Boston Red Sox scout Levy Ochoa signed him to the Red Sox in 2000. Professional career =Boston Red Sox= Ram√≠rez signed with the Boston Red Sox as an international free agent in July 2000, at age 16. He played in the Dominican Summer League for the DSL Red Sox in 2001. In 2002, with the GCL Red Sox he hit .340 and was selected as a Gulf Coast League and Rookie League All-Star. He also batted .371 in 22 games with the Class A Short Season Lowell Spinners that year. Ram√≠rez spent 2003 with the Class A Augusta GreenJackets, batting .275 in 111 games. In 2004, he split time across the GCL Red Sox (batting .400 in 6 games), the Class A-Advanced Sarasota Red Sox (.310 in 62 games), and the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs (.310 in 32 games). Ram√≠rez was rated by Baseball America as the number ten prospect in baseball prior to the 2005 season, and with the Sea Dogs that year he was selected as an Eastern League All-Star while hitting .271 in 122 games. Ram√≠rez made his MLB debut on September 20, 2005, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, entering the game as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the seventh inning and then striking out in his first at bat in the top of the eighth inning against Tim Corcoran. Ram√≠rez appeared in only one other game that season, striking out again in one at bat. =Florida/Miami Marlins= 2006 season After the 2005 season, the Red Sox traded Ram√≠rez and An√≠bal S√°nchez, Jes√∫s Delgado, and Harvey Garc√≠a for Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell and Guillermo Mota. During spring training, Ram√≠rez was impressive enough to earn the starting shortstop job over Robert Andino. On April 3, he recorded his first Major League hit in his first at bat of the season, a single to center field off of Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt. On April 18, he led off the game with his first Major League home run off of Eric Milton of the Cincinnati Reds. He hit his second home run in the seventh inning of that game against reliever Mike Burns. Ram√≠rez led all MLB rookies with 185 hits, 119 runs, 11 triples and 51 stolen bases. He hit seven leadoff home runs, the most in team history for a season and career. Ram√≠rez's 46 doubles in the 2006 season is the all-time NL record for a shortstop age 22 or younger.FOX sports report He was the first NL rookie to post 110-plus runs and 50-plus stolen bases. He became the fifth big-league player since 1900 to hit 45-plus doubles and have 50-plus stolen bases, joining Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker. and Lou Brock. He finished the season as the NL Rookie of the Year Award named by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 2007 season During his sophomore season, Ram√≠rez picked up where he left off. The ever-improving young star, who referred to Ryan Howard when asked about the sophomore jinx in baseball, was hitting .331 with 14 home runs and 35 RBIs to go along with 27 steals at the All-Star break. Despite his numbers, he did not make the All-Star roster. Marlins manager Fredi Gonz√°lez experimented with Ram√≠rez a bit in the number three slot in the lineup, batting him ahead of Mike Jacobs when injuries hit the Marlins position players. Gonzalez believed Ram√≠rez could be a middle-of-the-lineup player despite his speed, because he hit for power. In a game versus the Cincinnati Reds on July 22, 2007 Ram√≠rez overextended his shoulder when he tried to hit a pitch on the lower outside corner off right-hander Bronson Arroyo. He was helped off the field and was determined to have suffered a partial dislocation of his left shoulder. In 154 games Ram√≠rez batted .332 with 29 home runs, 81 RBIs, 125 runs and 51 steals. He fell one home run shy of becoming only the third player in baseball history to hit 30 or more home runs and steal 50 or more bases in the same season. Ram√≠rez led the National League in VORP. After the end of the season, Ram√≠rez underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair his injured left shoulder. 2008 season Entering the 2008 season, Ram√≠rez was now looked at as the face of the franchise after the Marlins traded All-Stars Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis to the Detroit Tigers. Ram√≠rez contributed well in the Marlins fast start, earning a spot as the starting shortstop for the National League All- Star team for the first time in his career. He was 2-for-3 with two singles and a run in the 2008 All-Star Game. In addition, Ram√≠rez agreed to a six- year, $70 million extension, by far making it the richest contract in Marlins history. Ram√≠rez was named NL Player of the Month in June. He had been batting .298 with six doubles, a triple and ten home runs. He led the NL in three categories: home runs, runs scored and total bases. Ram√≠rez hit his 30th home run of the season on September 13 and joined Preston Wilson in 2000 as the only Marlins to become members of the 30‚Äì30 club. He ended the season with 33 home runs and 35 stolen bases. He recorded only 67 RBIs, the fewest ever in a 30‚Äì30 season. 2009 season Florida Marlins in 2009 Ram√≠rez played in the World Baseball Classic for his native Dominican Republic prior to the 2009 season. During the April 6, 2009 regular season opener against the Washington Nationals, Ram√≠rez hit his first career grand-slam off of Washington reliever Steven Shell. On July 5, 2009, Ram√≠rez was the NL starting shortstop for the 2009 All-Star Game. On September 6, against the Nationals, Ram√≠rez hit his 100th home run of his MLB career, becoming the fourth quickest shortstop in terms of games played to reach that milestone (Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra, and Ernie Banks). With a batting average of .342, Ram√≠rez won his first batting title. He recorded 106 RBIs (sixth in NL), stole 27 bases (fifth in NL), and scored 101 times (eighth in NL). He won the Silver Slugger Award at shortstop, and came in second to Albert Pujols for NL MVP. 2010 season On May 17 in a home game versus the Arizona Diamondbacks, Ram√≠rez fouled a ball off his ankle in his first at-bat. He looked as if he was in some pain but remained in the game. He then grounded into a double play to end the inning as he slowly ran to first base. The next inning, with runners on first and second, a bloop shot was sent into shallow left field. Ram√≠rez ran to catch it. He did not, and when it hit the ground, Ram√≠rez inadvertently kicked it into the left-field corner. Ram√≠rez then jogged all the way to the corner as Diamondbacks rounded the bases. Two of the three runners would end up scoring with the other ending up on third. Then-manager of the Marlins Fredi Gonz√°lez removed Ram√≠rez from the game, and a war of words led to Ram√≠rez being benched for the next game. In his first game back against the St. Louis Cardinals, Ram√≠rez went 3‚Äìfor-5 with a RBI. About a month later, Gonzalez was fired. Ram√≠rez was voted in as a starter for the 2010 All Star game for the third year in a row. He was also chosen to participate in the State Farm Home Run Derby for the first time in his career. In the Derby, he came in second place to Boston's David Ortiz. Ram√≠rez hit his 25th career leadoff home run and his first career walk-off hit on August 7 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He came up to bat in the bottom of the 10th inning with a man on first base hit a walk-off double to right-center field to end the Marlins' five-game losing streak. On September 15 in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Ram√≠rez aggravated an injury in his elbow he sustained earlier in the season while swinging. He attempted to come back and play a week later, but after one game, he was still in pain and shut down for the rest of the season. He finished 2010 with a .300 batting average, 21 home runs, 76 RBIs, 32 steals and 92 runs scored. 2011 season During the 2011 season, Ram√≠rez performed below levels seen in recent seasons. By June 20, Ram√≠rez was hitting just .200 with only 4 home runs and 17 RBIs. However, he raised his stats up to .243 with 8 home runs and 37 RBIs by July 9. For the first time in his career, Ram√≠rez hit cleanup. He injured himself after trying to make a diving catch in a game against the New York Mets on August 2, aggravating a shoulder injury that plagued him in 2010. He missed the rest of 2011, playing only 92 games, and needed surgery in the off-season. He finished the season batting .243, 10 HR, and 45 RBIs. The Marlins, who were 55-55 at the time of the injury, finished 72-90\\\\. 2012 season During the 2011‚Äì2012 off- season the Marlins, during their rebuilding stage, acquired reigning the National League batting champ shortstop Jos√© Reyes. Prior to that signing, Ram√≠rez was the shortstop. After the signing, reports circulated claiming that Ram√≠rez was unhappy with being forced to change positions to third base. After a slow start, Ram√≠rez finished strong in May with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs. On July 13, 2012, Ram√≠rez dropped in the batting order from second to fifth to start the second half of the baseball season. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On July 25, 2012, Ram√≠rez was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers together with Randy Choate for Nathan Eovaldi and minor league pitching prospect Scott McGough. At the time of his trade, Ram√≠rez was batting .246 with 14 home runs and 48 RBIs and had recorded 14 stolen bases. 2012 season In his debut with the Dodgers, Ram√≠rez hit a triple in his first at-bat. He went 2-for-4 with a RBI, and a run in a losing effort against the St. Louis Cardinals. He hit his first home run for the Dodgers on July 27, winning the game in extra innings in Game 1 of a series with the San Francisco Giants. In 64 games, he hit .271 with 10 homers and 44 RBIs. He had three walk-off hits in 2012, the most in MLB. 2013 season Ram√≠rez with the Los Angeles Dodgers in April 2013. He played with the Dominican team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In the championship game against Puerto Rico he injured his hand while diving for a ball. An MRI the next day revealed a torn thumb ligament which would require surgery. The Dodgers announced that he would miss the first two months of the season while recovering, however, he rejoined the Dodgers on April 29, earlier than expected. In just his third start after returning, Ram√≠rez suffered a hamstring injury while running the bases on May 3 and returned to the disabled list. He eventually rejoined the Dodgers on June 4. His return from the disabled list reignited the Dodgers offense and they started to get hot, which included a 46-10 record from mid-June to mid- August and they went from last place to winning the National League West. Ram√≠rez, in just 86 games, hit .345 with 20 home runs and 57 RBI and reached the playoffs for the first time in his career. In the 2013 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, Ram√≠rez went 8 for 16 with six extra-base hits, tying a franchise postseason record. In Game 1 of the 2013 National League Championship Series, Ram√≠rez was hit by a fastball on a 1-2 count in the first inning, fracturing two ribs and taking him out of the series, which the Dodgers lost in six games. 2014 season Ram√≠rez with the Dodgers In the last year of his contract, Ram√≠rez dealt with several injuries throughout the season. He finished the regular season hitting .283, with 13 home runs and 71 RBIs in 128 games. On August 2, Ram√≠rez hit his first career walk-off home run off of the Cubs' Blake Parker in the 12th inning. He became a free agent after the season, even though the Dodgers did extend a qualifying offer to him. Based on his history of committing errors, Ramirez was widely considered a defensive liability. Ram√≠rez cost starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw a perfect game on June 18 by committing a throwing error in the top of the seventh inning. Afterwards, Manager Don Mattingly replaced him with SS Carlos Triunfel for defensive purposes. =Return to the Boston Red Sox= On November 25, 2014, Ram√≠rez signed a four-year, $88 million deal with a fifth year vesting option worth $22 million, to return to the Boston Red Sox. They announced plans to play him in left field, even though he had only previously played shortstop and third base in his career. 2015 season Ram√≠rez talking with umpire Will Little. On Opening Day 2015 on April 6, in his first game with Boston in almost 10 years, Ram√≠rez played left field for the first time in his career and hit two home runs (one being a broken-bat grand slam) for a total of 5 RBI as the Red Sox routed the Philadelphia Phillies 8‚Äì0. On April 29, Ram√≠rez hit his 10th home run of the season, joining teammate David Ortiz as the only players in Red Sox history to hit 10 home runs in the month of April.The Star Ledger. May 1, 2015. pg. 33 However, a few days later on May 4, Ram√≠rez left the game against the Tampa Bay Rays in the top of the first inning after crashing into the left field wall at Fenway Park. The team announced shortly after that he had suffered a left shoulder sprain. Ram√≠rez ended the 2015 season with a .249 batting average and 19 home runs in 401 at-bats, as his defensive rating in left field was rated as the worst in the American League. As a result, on September 1 the Red Sox announced Ram√≠rez would not play left field for the remainder of the season. The Red Sox also announced then that Ram√≠rez would again change positions in 2016, as its starting first baseman, a new position that he never played before. 2016 season Ram√≠rez reported early to 2016 spring training with the Red Sox and dismissed his impending positional switch to first base as nothing hard. Once the season began, the transition was well received by the press and clubhouse, with praise going to his improved defense and greater comfort in the infield.Ramirez-to-first base experiment shaping up as success. CSN. Retrieved on August 13, 2016. On July 20, 2016, Ram√≠rez belted three two- run home runs in Boston's 11‚Äì7 interleague play victory against the San Francisco Giants at Fenway Park.Boston 11, San Francisco 7.

Then on August 12, he hit a pair of three-run home runs as the Red Sox beat the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks, 9‚Äì4, in an interleague game. It was his 20th career multihomer game, while his six runs batted in matched a career-high.Ramirez homers twice, Red Sox beat Diamondbacks 9-4. ESPN. Retrieved on August 13, 2016. On September 15, 2016, in perhaps the most memorable at bat of his season, Ram√≠rez hit a walk off three-run home run to stun the Yankees and complete a thrilling come from behind victory. The win would help catapult the Red Sox to an eleven-game win streak and eventually the 2016 AL East crown. On October 2, 2016, Ram√≠rez hit his 30th home run of the season. Ram√≠rez, Mookie Betts and David Ortiz became the first trio in Red Sox history with 30 home runs and more than 100 RBIs in the same season. Ram√≠rez would finish the season with a .286 batting average and 111 RBI, a new career high. 2017 season With the retirement of David Ortiz and the offseason addition of first baseman Mitch Moreland, Ram√≠rez took on the role as the designated hitter for the Red Sox. He had his lowest major league batting average ever as part of a .242/.320/.429 slash line, with 23 home runs, 62 RBIs, and one stolen base (the lowest total of his career) while coming in fourth in the league with eight intentional walks, and playing only 18 games in the field (all at first base). In the postseason, Ram√≠rez batted 8-for-14 (.571) in the 2017 ALDS as the Red Sox lost to the eventual World Series champions, the Houston Astros. 2018 season In 2018, Ram√≠rez batted .330 for the month of April, but struggled in May, batting .163. On May 25, Ram√≠rez was designated for assignment by the Red Sox as the team activated Dustin Pedroia from the disabled list. He was released on May 30. In 2018, he had a career-low 177 at bats, in which he batted .254/.313/.395 with a career-low .708 OPS. Overall, in Ram√≠rez's second stint with the Red Sox (2015‚Äì18), he batted .260 with 78 home runs and 255 RBIs in 429 games. His salary in 2018 was $22 million. =Cleveland Indians= On February 26, 2019, Ram√≠rez signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, which included an invitation to the team's 2019 major league spring training camp. The Indians purchased Ram√≠rez's contract on March 28. In 16 games with Cleveland, Ram√≠rez batted 9-for-49 (.184) with two home runs and eight RBIs, and had the slowest average home run trot of all major league players for the season, at 29.2 seconds. The Indians designated Ram√≠rez for assignment on April 20. After clearing waivers, Ram√≠rez elected free agency on April 22. Personal life Ram√≠rez and his wife, Sanoe (Elisabeth), have three children. Ram√≠rez enjoys reggae music and DJing, as well as listening to merengue and bachata music. He maintains a close friendship with former teammate and fellow Dominican David Ortiz. In June 2018, shortly after his release by the Red Sox, Ram√≠rez was briefly reported to have a possible connection with a federal and state investigation into a drug ring based out of Lawrence, Massachusetts. Within days, it was clarified that Ram√≠rez was not linked to the investigation and that a person arrested in the case had used his name ‚Äúto get the cops off his back, which didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù In April 2019, Ram√≠rez became a naturalized United States citizen.

The order has only one class with the dignity of Knight (Member for women and Member of the Cloth for clergymen), and is the foremost order of Sweden. The three above-mentioned Orders together with the Order of Vasa form the Orders of His Majesty the Kingkungahuset.se (Swedish Kungl. Maj:ts Orden).Orders (in Swedish). Note: This is inconsistent with the English version of the page, which does not include the Order of Vasa in the Orders of HM the King. A Swedish Knight of the Order of the Seraphim is not referred to as a Knight of the Seraphim, but rather as a Knight and Commander of the Orders of His Majesty the King (). This form is used because the Swedish word orden is an old plural form which indicates that a knight has to be a Commander Grand Cross or Commander of at least one of the other Swedish Orders. Foreign Knights are for the greater part Knights of the Order of the Seraphim. A Knight of the Order may be styled \\"Herr\\" + surname, which used to be the formal style for Swedish secular Knights (untitled high-ranking noblemen) appointed by the Swedish King, a practice that ceased in the 17th Century. When originally instituted the knights of the Order were required to supervise the major hospitals and mental asylums in Sweden, and in particular, the Seraphim Hospital, which was a major hospital in Stockholm until it was closed in 1980. This requirement would die out as boards of physicians and other professionals made such supervision by the Knights of the Seraphim anachronistic during the course of the 19th century. As part of the reorganization of Swedish orders in 1975, appointments of Swedish citizens to the various orders ceased and conferrals were restricted to foreigners (the last non-royal Swedish holder was Sten Rudholm). Likewise, the Order of the Seraphim was restricted to foreign heads of state and equivalents. In 1995, the law was revised and conferrals upon members of the royal family was allowed. History The medieval custom of new crowned monarchs dubbing knights at their coronationsFor an English parallel see Order of the Bath in Sir Ivan De la Bere (1964). THE QUEEN'S ORDERS OF CHIVALRY (rev. ed.). London: Spring Books. as a way of specially honoring particular noblemen was apparently accompanied in Sweden with the gift of a chain apparently specially designed for the occasion. These chains did not indicate the initiation into an order of chivalry as this is usually understood, since the bestowal of a chain of a particular design only occurred at a particular coronation and was not repeated at any other coronations or royal event. The description of some of these chains from the some of pre-Vasa coronations states that they consisted of alternating link of seraphim heads and patriarchal crosses, thus perhaps creating the later impression that there had been an earlier order of the Seraphim of which the 1748 order was seen as a revival. It seems reasonable to assume, at very least, that the accounts of these earlier knightly collars influenced the choice of design for the collar of the 1748 order. This medieval custom survived into the period of the Vasa dynasty as well, for Eric XIV is known to have bestowed the Order of the Saviour at his coronation in 1561. Similarly, John III had bestowed the Order of the Lamb of God (Agnus Dei) in 1569. It is noteworthy that a contemporary representation of this order shows a collar of alternating red-enameled seraphim heads and gold patriarchal crosses from which hangs as pendant an oval badge enameled blue and bearing the Greek letters of the Christogram IHS (the initials of the name of Jesus in Greek) with a cross above and the three nails of the Passion below between the three crowns of the Swedish royal arms‚Äîthe same as the central medallion of the latter Order of the Seraphim.Favine, Andrew (1623). The Theatre of Honour and Knighthood. Translated from the French. Charles IX bestowed the Royal Order of Jehova or Jehova Order at his coronation in 1606‚Äîperhaps as Calvinist alternative or reaction to the Catholic devotion to the Name of Jesus implied in his brother's coronation order. Charles X Gustav's Order of the Name of Jesus took the form of a similar circular medallion bearing the letters IHS in diamonds surrounded by a border of diamonds in the center of a cross formed of four enameled Vasa sheaves and hanging from a pink ribbon worn around the neck, of which one example survives in the collections of the Royal Armory.Conforti, Michael and Guy Walton (eds.). Sweden: A Royal Treasury 1550‚Äì1700. Washington, DC: National Gallery of Art, 1988 Exhibition catalogue. Queen Christina founded an Order of the Amaranth, although apparently not at her coronation, but it also did not survive her reign. Because of these previous orders the first set of statutes described the Order as \\"revived\\". The French Order of the Holy Spirit may have inspired the idea of placing the earlier medallion of the Name of Jesus in the center of a white enameled Maltese cross with gold Seraphim heads between the arms of this cross guarding this medallion with their wings, just as the French order bore the white dove of the Holy Spirit surrounded by green flames on similar white Maltese cross. Also like the French royal orders of chivalry the breast stars of the Swedish orders similarly took the form of silver crosses. Associated with the Order was the Seraphim Medal awarded to people who made significant contributions to Swedish charities, especially to the hospitals and mental asylums patronized by the Order. This medal consisted a gold coin-like representation of the bust of the Order's founder, King Frederick I, beneath a royal crown hanging by eight small chains from a suspension bar ornamented with a design of acanthus leaves. Royal family Until 1975 the sons of the Swedish monarch received a miniature version of the order's insignia at their baptism. As part of a reform on orders and decorations, a law was passed in 1974 restricting the conferral of orders to foreign citizens. This law was revised in 1995 to allow members of the Swedish Royal Family to receive the order.Ordenskung√∂relse (1974:768) That year, on her 18th birthday, Crown Princess Victoria became a member of the order. Prince Carl Philip and Princess Madeline likewise became a knight/member of the order on their 18th birthday. The tradition of conferring the order upon the baptism of a member of the royal family returned when Princess Estelle, the first-born of Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, received a miniature Grand Cross of the Order's insignia from her grandfather, King Carl Gustaf at her baptism on 22 May 2012. Princess Leonore, daughter of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill, was also conferred the order at her baptism on 8 June 2014. Insignia and habits Collar and badge of the Order of the Seraphim. Sash and star as worn by Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden and her husband Prince Daniel, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland Knights and Members of the Order wear the badge on a collar (chain) or on a sash from the right shoulder, and the star on the left chest: *The collar of the Order is in gold, with eleven patriarchal crosses enamelled in turquoise blue and eleven gold seraphim, each represented as a child's head surrounded by six wings, each with a slightly different facial expression.I. e., the front seraph faces the beholder, those immediately on either side are turned slightly towards him; the next three seraphim on either side repeat this patter, while the two remaining seraphim on the back are turned towards each other. *The badge of the Order is a white-enamelled gold Maltese Cross, with a gold patriarchal cross on each arm of the cross, and gold seraphim between the arms of the cross and framing with their wings the central medallion. The obverse central medallion is in blue enamel, with a white-enamelled \\"IHS\\" Christogram between three gold crowns, beneath which are represented the three nails with which Jesus Christ was crucified. The reverse central medallion is also in blue enamel, with the white-enamelled letters \\"FRS\\" (Fredericus, Rex Sueciae, Frederick King of Sweden), the founder of the Order. The badge hangs from a gold and enamelled royal crown. The infant-sized badge is slightly smaller than the regular one. *The star of the Order is the same as the obverse of the badge without the royal crown, except that the star is entirely of silverThe current, 2006 model of the Seraphim star has gilded seraphim heads. and only the central medallion is enamelled as on the badge but larger. *The ribbon (sash) of the Order is pale blue, referred to in Sweden as seraphim blue. The infant-sized sash is significantly smaller than the regular one. =Habits of the Order= Formerly Knights of the Order also had two distinctive habits, worn on special and formal occasions such as coronations, chapters, etc. They were called the Great Habit and the Lesser Habit. *The Great Habit was in black and white. The habit included white satin breeches and doublet, with black buttons and trimmed in black lace, over which was worn a black satin mantle, lined with white satin and also trimmed in black lace and a white collar. Both the doublet and the mantle bore the star of the Order embroidered over the left breast and the habit included a pair of white boots with black toes and heels and trimmed in black lace and gilded spurs and a black top hat with a white satin hat band and a plume of white ostrich and black egret feathers. *The Lesser Habit was in amaranth purple and pale gold. This habit had amaranth velvet breeches and doublet with padded shoulders and pale gold buttons, piping and cuffs and a pale gold satin tasseled sash around the waist, over which was worn an amaranth purple satin mantle lined with pale gold satin and with a pale gold collar. The star of the Order was also embroidered over the left breast on both the mantle and the waistcoat. The habit had black boots and gilded spurs and was worn with the same black top hat with a plume of white ostrich and black egret feathers as the Great Habit, but a pale gold satin hat band. *The collar of the Order was worn over the doublets of both habits.

The actual reception into the Order, however, was fixed at 28 April, the birthday of King Frederick I, the founder of the Order. In the interval between the nomination and the reception, the newly elected member could only wear the star, but not the cross with the ribbon. The reception of new knights into the Order took place at Stockholm in the Riddarholmen Church or in the royal chapel in the Stockholm Palace, in the presence of all the Knights and functionaries of the Order, as also of the Commanders of all the other orders. The ceremonies were as follows: The king was seated under a canopy to the right of the altar and the Knights assembled occupied benches to the right and the left, while the newly elected Knight was placed before the altar between two senior Knights, who acted, as it were, as sponsors. After the hymn, \\"Come, Holy Spirit\\", was chanted, the chief preacher of the Court briefly addressed those assembled on the duties of the subjects towards God, the King and the country. The Chancellor, who stood to the left of the sovereign, then explained in a few words the object of the order, the honour attached to it, and the reasons which had induced His Majesty to elect the new Knight. The two sponsors, thereupon, conduct the postulant before the King, where he kneels down, and replies affirmatively, with a simple \\"Yes,\\" to all the following questions: Did he promise before God and the King: #To honour, defend and preserve the laws and statutes of the Order? #To be ready to shed his blood for the Evangelical Lutheran religion and for the welfare of the country? #To assist, by his courage, to sustain the ancient glory of the Swedish Name? #To contribute, to the best of his power, to a life of peace and union amongst the Knights of the Order? #To watch over the honours and privileges now granted to him? #To do good to the poor and to protect widows and orphans? On these questions being answered, the King handed the diploma to the Secretary from whom the Chancellor received the document and read it aloud to the assembly, after which the new Knight swore to defend with his life and property the Christian faith, to remain true to the King and the State, to protect the poor, widows and orphans, and to promote their welfare to the best of his power. The King then took from the Treasurer the chain of the Order, hung it round the neck of the new knight and, dubbed him with the coronation sword, saying: \\"We, N., King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Wends, receive thee as are brave and honourable Swedish and Gothic Knight of our Order of the Seraphim. Be worthy of it,\\" and embracing him amid the sound of drums and trumpets, he concluded with the words: \\"May the Lord protect thee!\\" The new Knight, then thanked His Majesty, kissed his hand, and embraced all his new colleagues, whereupon each of them repeated the words: \\"May the Lord protect thee!\\" With this the ceremony concluded. The practice of dubbing ceased in 1902. Coats of arms Serafimerringningen 11 February 2015 for Richard von Weizs√§cker. Each new knight or member has their coat of arms, surrounded with the collar or sash of the order, painted on a copper plate. A selection of these plates is exhibited in Seraphim room at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is hung in the former royal burial church Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm, and when the funeral takes place the church bells are rung constantly from 12:00 to 13:00, a practice known as the Serafimerringningen.

Since 2003, he's been the President of Rochester Poets; in October, 2004 he was one of the founding members of the Rochester Area Haiku Group; in 2005 he became Director of the Rochester Poetry Workshop, which he formed from the Rochester area Meetup poetry group when Meetup announced it would impose a monthly fee for its previously free flagship service. From 2011 to 2018 he taught creative writing at OASIS, the group of educational centers founded in 1983 and supported for many years by The May Company, which became part of Macy's. Since 2003, Judge has been the host of the monthly Rochester Poets reading series, which was initially held at Rochester's Writers & Books literary center but, in 2005, moved to St. John Fisher College, where it was held in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center until 2015. In the fall of 2016, the series moved to The Clover Center for Arts & Spirituality, relocated to the Legacy at Clover Blossom complex in March 2017, and then to Legacy at Cranberry Landing in 2018. From 2004 to 2011, he was the Rochester area organizer for Poets Against the War & Occupation; from March 2007 to September 2009, he hosted a monthly reading series at Rochester's anti-war Peace Storefront, a program of the Peace Action & Education task force of Metro Justice of Rochester.

In December 2008, he started the monthly series, Rochester Poets @ Lovin' Cup, a cafe which opened in the summer of 2008 at Park Point near RIT in Henrietta, NY. The series was discontinued in 2009 when time constraints, audience mix, lack of publicity and promotion, and changing focus by the venue made an ongoing literary event unfeasible. From August 2007 to August 2009, Judge hosted the bi-weekly Free Speech Zone series at Rochester's Mez Cafe. The Mez closed in August 2009. In October, the venue was renovated and re-opened under new management as the Tango Cafe. The Free Speech Zone resumed in November, 2009 and ran until December, 2011.

As with all horseshoe bats, the species gets its name from its distinctive horseshoe-shaped noseleaf. Physical description The lesser horseshoe bat is one of the world's smallest bats, weighing only 5 to 9 grams, with a wingspan of 192‚Äì254 mm and a body length of 35‚Äì45 mm. It has strong feet that it uses to grasp rocks and branches, and can see well in spite of its small eyes. Like most bats, lesser horseshoe bats live in colonies and hunt their prey by echolocation, emitting ultrasound from specialized round pads in their mouth. The base of its fur, which is soft and fluffy, is light grey in colour, with dorsal side fur smoky brown and the ventral side grey, with the exception of juvenile bats which are entirely dark grey. Ears and wing membranes are a light greyish brown. When hunting they are quick and agile, often flying within five metres of the ground while avoiding contact with bushes and shrubs. The lesser horseshoe bat eats small insects, most of which are gleaned from stones and branches. Their favorite types of prey include flies, mosquitoes, butterflies, moths, and spiders. The average lifespan of Rhinolophus hipposideros is 3 years, although some individuals have been known to live far longer. Mating Lesser horseshoe bats mate in the autumn. Females give birth to one pup, normally between mid-June and the beginning of July. Pups weigh around 1.8 grams at birth, opening their eyes after around 10 days and becoming independent at six to seven weeks of age. The bats hibernate during the winter months in dark caves, mines, old buildings, and sometimes in cellars. Females become sexually mature within their first year, with a study in Czechoslovakia showing that about 15% of females give birth at one year of age. Animals have been seen to chase each other as a preliminary to mating, which is done with the male hanging himself behind and over the female. Nurseries are often shared with other species, such as the greater mouse-eared bat, but there is no direct mixing with other species. The move to nurseries occurs from April onwards, with between 10 and 100 females present and between 2 and 20 males. Approximately two-thirds of females in a nursery roost give birth between mid- June and mid-July. Habitat Lesser horseshoe bat in cave during winter. The lesser horseshoe bat lives in warmer regions in foothills and highland, in particular wooded areas or areas of limestone, where it roosts in caves. In summer its range has been recorded up to 1160 m above sea level, and up to 2000 m in the winter, with the highest known nursery roost at 950 m. The species is sedentary, with the average movement between summer and winter roosts between 5 and 10 kilometers, although the longest recorded distance is 153 kilometers. Distribution The species can be found in western Ireland and south-west Britain, with some larger populations in parts of Germany and the Bavarian foothills of the Alps. Rhinolophus hipposideros is widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, occurring in North Africa and on most larger islands to Asia Minor and around the Black Sea. In Asia, it can be found in Kashmir, the Near East, Iran, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as part of East Africa. Rhinolophus hipposideros - Science for Nature Foundation =United Kingdom= Conservation of the Lesser horseshoe bat in the Wye Valley and the Forest of Dean; a short video by NRW. The UK distribution of the lesser horseshoe bat can be found on the National Biodiversity Network website here, but they are mostly found in Wales and the Southwest of England. A torpid lesser horseshoe bat, Gloucestershire, UK A large breeding colony of lesser horseshoe bats populates the smallest SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) in the UK, a 7m¬≤ barn in Gloucestershire, England.Stuart Bell and Donald McGillivray, Environmental Law, 7th ed 2008, p. 690 The species is threatened by a number of factors, including the disturbance or destruction of roosts, changes in agricultural practices (such as the increased use of insecticides, which reduce prey availability) and the loss of suitable foraging habitats. However, the Bat Conservation Trust's Hibernation Survey shows numbers in the UK are increasing significantly - by an average of 4.5% yearly between 1999 and 2012, a 77.2% total increase during that period. =Ireland= The lesser horseshoe bat has been recorded in the counties Galway, South Mayo, Clare, Limerick, Cork and Kerry.McAney, K., O'Mahony, C., Kellecher, C., Taylor, A. and Biggane, S. 2013. The Lesser Horseshoe Bat in Ireland: surveys by The Vincent Wildlife Trust. occasional publication in: Ir. Nat. J. 1 - 38. = Israel = The lesser horseshoe bat is rare in Israel. =Balearic Islands= In the Balearic Islands, Rhinolophus hipposideros lives on all three of the main islands: Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza, as well as the smaller islands Cabrera and Formentera. Roosts containing up to 50 individuals have been found in caves such as the Cova de Ca Na Rea (Ibiza), though most groups tend to be smaller. In the Balearics, the lesser horseshoe bat travels only short distances, usually around 2 km, and is also the most common bat species on Ibiza. Echolocation The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 93‚Äì111 kHz, have most energy at 110 kHz and have an average duration of 31.7 ms.Parsons, S. and Jones, G. (2000) 'Acoustic identification of twelve species of echolocating bat by discriminant function analysis and artificial neural networks.' J Exp Biol., 203: 2641-2656.Obrist, M.K., Boesch, R. and Fl√ºckiger, P.F. (2004) 'Variability in echolocation call design of 26 Swiss bat species: Consequences, limits and options for automated field identification with a synergic pattern recognition approach.' Mammalia., 68 (4): 307-32. Due to the frequency of their echolocation calls there are overlaps with those of the Mediterranean horseshoe bat and Mehely's horseshoe bat. Conservation This species is protected in the European Union under the Habitats Directive. This species is also listed in the Berne Convention and is specifically targeted by the UNEP-EUROBATS convention. Several national legislation are also protecting this species and its habitats in many countries and regions. In order to highlight the importance of protecting this species at the European scale, this species was selected as bat species of the Year 2018-2019 by the pan-European NGO BatLife Europe.

The community was built in the 1940s by Aramco (now Saudi Aramco). The Abqaiq community had a population of approximately 1,500 in 2012, though the inclusion of the population outside the Saudi Aramco community brings this number closer to 30,000. Abqaiq has been organizing a Safari Festival since 2017. The 10-days festival aims at presenting the Arab and desert heritage by presenting different shows. Terrorism and security Abqaiq was the site of a terrorist attack attempt by al-Qaeda on 24 February 2006, targeting the oil processing facility. The 250-hectare complex can process 7 million barrels of oil a day. According to Ali Al-Naimi, \\"One of the cars exploded at the outer perimeter gate after guards fired on it. The second car made it through the first gate but also exploded under fire in a parking area. Both of the terrorists were killed.\\" News of the attack pushed oil prices up by 2 dollars. The damage, however, was immediately contained by Saudi Aramco. According to Khalid R. al-Rodhan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \\"even if some of the facilities were destroyed, Saudi Aramco has claimed that it has backup and redundant facilities to produce at near capacity\\". In a report about the incident, he concludes that \\"the attack against Abqaiq should not be seen as a turning point in either Saudi stability or the global energy market. Rather, it is evidence that al-Qaeda and other extremists groups will stop at nothing to disturb the global economy and international peace. It also signals that al-Qaeda is changing tactics to attack an area that will garner most attention and inflict most damage on the Saudi leadership, the U.S., and the international community.\\" However, a moderate to severe attack on Abqaiq would slow production from an average of a day to . The chief purpose of Abqaiq is to remove hydrogen sulfide from crude oil and reduce the vapor pressure, making the crude safe to be shipped in tankers. Abqaiq is the world's largest facility for this stabilization. On 14 September 2019 Abqaiq was attacked. The Houthis claimed responsibility, stating that they were retaliating for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. The United States government claimed that instead the attack may have originated in Iraq or Iran, stating that the impacts were consistent with an attack from that direction. No casualties were reported, and the damage cut Saudi Arabia's oil output by half, or 5% of the global oil supply. Transportation = Airport = There is a small single strip airport in Abqaiq (Abqaiq Airport), operated by Saudi Aramco and not open for commercial air traffic. However, people utilize the nearby King Fahd International Airport in Dammam which is currently 90 km away from Abqaiq (new road project currently in progress to shorten the distance to 70 km). It also provides full international air service. Alternatively, Al-Ahsa International Airport is just 80 km from Abqaiq however it offers limited international service.

Langone (born 1947) is an American counseling psychologist who specializes in research about cultic groups and psychological manipulation.

Langone is author and co-author of two books and several articles. He first joined the International Cultic Studies Association (at that time known as the \\"American Family Foundation\\") in 1981.  Career  Langone received his Ph.D in Counseling Psychology from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1979, where he was a Regents Fellow for three years, and he began his work in cults in 1978. Langone defines a cult as \\"a group or movement exhibiting a great or excessive devotion or dedication to some person, idea, or thing, and employing unethically manipulative techniques of persuasion and control designed to advance the goals of the group‚Äôs leader, to the actual or possible detriment of members, their families, or the community\\".Cults Questions and Answers Langone, Michael, 1988 Langone joined the American Family Foundation in 1981, the organization later changed its name to the International Cultic Studies Association. In 1984 he became the editor of the American Family Foundation's house publication, Cultic Studies Journal. The journal ceased publication in 2001 and was replaced with Cultic Studies Review as an Internet/online journal with triennial print editions.  Theories  In his book Recovering from Cults, Langone writes that cults \\"need not be religious in nature but may be psycho-therapeutic, political, or commercial\\". In his writings, Langone argues that new religions conflict with traditional American beliefs and have to be considered objectionable for that reason, stating that he makes no apologies \\"for evaluating cults in terms of fundamental American values, which I have imbibed, examined and accepted.\\" The former American Family Foundation, headed by Langone, is described as offering the most public support for the mind-control theory through its Cultic Studies Journal. The theory is seen by researchers as a propaganda device used by the anti-cult movement to rationalize the persecution of minority religious groups.

Paul Sillitoe wrote that: Local biological knowledge, collected and sampled over these early centuries significantly informed the early development of modern biology: * during the 17th century Georg Eberhard Rumphius benefited from local biological knowledge in producing his catalogue, \\"Herbarium Amboinense\\", covering more than 1,200 species of the plants in Indonesia; * during the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus relied upon Rumphius's work, and also corresponded with other people all around the world when developing the biological classification scheme that now underlies the arrangement of much of the accumulated knowledge of the biological sciences. * during the 19th century, Charles Darwin, the 'father' of evolutionary theory, on his Voyage of the Beagle took interest in the local biological knowledge of peoples he encountered. =Phase I (1900s‚Äì1940s)= Ethnobiology itself, as a distinctive practice, only emerged during the 20th century as part of the records then being made about other peoples, and other cultures. As a practice, it was nearly always ancillary to other pursuits when documenting others' languages, folklore, and natural resource use. Roy Ellen commented that: This 'first phase' in the development of ethnobiology as a practice has been described as still having an essentially utilitarian purpose, often focusing on identifying those 'native' plants, animals and technologies of some potential use and value within increasingly dominant western economic systemsExamples of studies from this 'first' phase in the development of ethnobiology include Stevenson (1915), Castetter (1944) and Harrington (1947) =Phase II (1950s‚Äì1970s)= Arising out of practices in Phase I (above) came a 'second phase' in the development of 'ethnobiology', with researchers now striving to better document and better understand how other peoples' themselves \\"conceptualize and categorize\\" the natural world around them. In Sillitoe's words: Some Mangyan (who count the Hanun√≥o among their members) men, on Mindoro island, Philippines, where Harold Conklin did his ethnobiological work This 'second' phase is marked: * in Northern America (mid 1950s) with Harold Conklin's completing his doctorate entitled \\"The relation of Hanun√≥o culture to the plant world\\"Conklin, H.C.

Porteres' and others work in economic biology.Porteres, R. (1977) =Present (1980s‚Äì2000s)= By the turn of the 21st century ethnobiological practices, research, and findings have had a significant impact and influence across a number of fields of biological inquiry including ecology,for instances of ethnobiology's influence on ecology, see Bal√©e (1998); Plotkin (1995); Schultes & von Reis (1995) conservation biology,for instances of ethnobiology's influence on conservation biology see Cunningham (2001); Johannes (1989); Laird (2002); Tuxill & Nabhan (2001) development studies,for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on development studies, see Warren, Slikkerveer & Brokensha (1995) and political ecology.for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on political ecology see Zerner (2000) The Society of Ethnobiology advises on its web page: > Ethnobiology is a rapidly growing field of research, gaining professional, > student, and public interest .. internationally Ethnobiology has come out from its place as an ancillary practice in the shadows of other core pursuits, to arise as a whole field of inquiry and research in its own right: taught within many tertiary institutions and educational programs around the world; with its own methods manuals,Ethnbiology methods manuals include Alexiades (1996) and Martin (1995) its own readers,one Ethnobiology reader is Minnis (2000) and its own textbooksone Ethnobiology textbook is Cotton (1996) Subjects of inquiry =Usage= All societies make use of the biological world in which they are situated, but there are wide differences in use, informed by perceived need, available technology, and the culture's sense of morality and sustainability. Ethnobiologists investigate what lifeforms are used for what purposes, the particular techniques of use, the reasons for these choices, and symbolic and spiritual implications of them. =Taxonomy= Different societies divide the living world up in different ways. Ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in particular cultures for living things, from the most specific terms (analogous to species names in Linnean biology) to more general terms (such as 'tree' and even more generally 'plant'). They also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of the classification system (if there is one; there is ongoing debate as to whether there must always be an implied hierarchy.Ellen, Roy (1993) pages 216 forward =Cosmological, moral and spiritual significance= Societies invest themselves and their world with meaning partly through their answers to questions like \\"how did the world happen?\\", \\"how and why did people come to be?\\", \\"what are proper practices, and why?\\", and \\"what realities exist beyond or behind our physical experience?\\" Understanding these elements of a societies' perspective is important to cultural research in general, and ethnobiologists investigate how a societies' view of the natural world informs and is informed by them. =Traditional ecological knowledge= In order to live effectively in a given place, a people needs to understand the particulars of their environment, and many traditional societies have complex and subtle understandings of the places in which they live. Ethnobiologists seek to share in these understandings, subject to ethical concerns regarding intellectual property and cultural appropriation. =Cross-cultural ethnobiology= In cross cultural ethnobiology research, two or more communities participate simultaneously. This enables the researcher to compare how a bio-resource is used by different communities.Franco, F.M. and Narasimhan, D. (2012). Ethnobotany of the Kondh, Poraja, Gadaba and Bonda of the Koraput region of Odisha, India. D.K. Printworld, New Delhi Subdisciplines =Ethnobotany= :Ethnobotany investigates the relationship between human societies and plants: how humans use plants ‚Äì as food, technology, medicine, and in ritual contexts; how they view and understand them; and their symbolic and spiritual role in a culture. =Ethnozoology= :The subfield ethnozoology focuses on the relationship between animals and humans throughout human history. It studies human practices such as hunting, fishing and animal husbandry in space and time, and human perspectives about animals such as their place in the moral and spiritual realms. =Ethnoecology= :Ethnoecology refers to an increasingly dominant 'ethnobiological' research paradigm focused, primarily, on documenting, describing, and understanding how other peoples perceive, manage, and use whole ecosystems. Other disciplines Studies and writings within ethnobiology draw upon research from fields including archaeology, geography, linguistics, systematics, population biology, ecology, cultural anthropology, ethnography, pharmacology, nutrition, conservation, and sustainable development. Ethics Through much of the history of ethnobiology, its practitioners were primarily from dominant cultures, and the benefit of their work often accrued to the dominant culture, with little control or benefit invested in the indigenous peoples whose practice and knowledge they recorded. Just as many of those indigenous societies work to assert legitimate control over physical resources such as traditional lands or artistic and ritual objects, many work to assert legitimate control over their intellectual property. In an age when the potential exists for large profits from the discovery of, for example, new food crops or medicinal plants, modern ethnobiologists must consider intellectual property rights, the need for informed consent, the potential for harm to informants, and their \\"debt to the societies in which they work\\".Code of Ethics of the American Anthropological Association, section A Furthermore, these questions must be considered not only in light of western industrialized nations' common understanding of ethics and law, but also in light of the ethical and legal standards of the societies from which the ethnobiologist draws information.Dodson (2007)  See also  * Anthropology * Biocultural diversity * Cultural landscapes * Darrell A.

These depictions arise from the √°lfar of Norse mythology influencing elves in fantasy as being semi-divine and of human stature, whose key traits are being friendly with nature and animals (Oftentimes being able to communicate with some facet of nature). However, this differs from Norse and the traditional elves found in Middle Ages folklore and Victorian era literature. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game) tend to be immortal or long-lived in comparison to humans, more beautiful and wiser, with sharper senses and perceptions, and abilities or crafts that seem alien or magical. Often elves do not possess facial or body hair, are not portrayed fat or old and are consequently perceived to be androgynous. As a race, Elves are typically depicted as more ancient than humans or other races, mentioned to have flourished in a sort of Golden Age forgotten by other races. That age was often long before other races appeared or were created. Consequently, Elves are often a living relic of a setting's respective fictional mythology and source of its lore. Characteristics and common features Modern fantasy literature has revived the elves as a race of semi-divine beings of human stature who are friendly with nature and animals. Although the √°lfar of Norse mythology has influenced the concept of elves in fantasy, the elves are different from Norse and the traditional elves found in Middle Ages folklore and Victorian era literature. A hallmark of fantasy elves is also their long and pointed ears (a convention began with a note of Tolkien's that the ears of elves were \\"leaf-shaped\\").Tresca, M. J. (2011) The Evolution of Fantasy Role- Playing Games. McFarland & Company, Inc.: Jefferson, p. 34 The length and shape of these ears vary depending on the artist or medium in question. Post- Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game) tend to be immortal or longeval in comparison to humans, more beautiful and wiser, with sharper senses and perceptions, and abilities or crafts that seem alien or magical. Often elves do not possess facial or body hair, are not portrayed fat or old and are consequently perceived to be androgynous. As a race, Elves are more ancient than humans or other races, mentioned to have flourished in a sort of Golden Age which has been forgotten by other races. That age was often long before other races appeared or were created. Consequently, Elves are often a living relic of a setting's respective fictional mythology and source of its lore. Half-elves and divergent races of elves, such as high elves and dark elves, were also popularized at this time; in particular, the evil drow of Dungeons & Dragons have inspired the dark elves of many other works of fantasy. Elves in modern fantasy literature Early pioneers of the genre such as Lord Dunsany in The King of Elfland's Daughter and Poul Anderson in The Broken Sword featured Norse-style elves. However, the elves found in the works of the 20th-century philologist and fantasy writer J. R. R. Tolkien have formed the view of elves in modern fantasy like no other singular source. The first appearance of modern fantasy elves occurred in The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The next modern work featuring elves was The Hobbit, a 1937 novel by J. R. R. Tolkien. Elves played a major role in many of Tolkien's later works, notably The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's elves were followed by grim Norse- style elves of human size in Poul Anderson's 1954 fantasy novel The Broken Sword. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954‚Äì1955) became extremely popular and was extensively imitated. In the 1960s and afterwards, elves similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple, non-human characters, in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Tolkien's Elves were enemies of goblins and had a long-standing quarrel with the dwarves; these motifs would re-appear in derivative works. =Tolkien's elves= Though Tolkien originally conceived his Elves as more fairy-like than they afterwards became, he also based them on the god-like and human-sized Lj√≥s√°lfar of Norse mythology. His elves were conceived as a race of beings similar in appearance to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature. They are great smiths and fierce warriors on the side of good. Tolkien's Elves of Middle-earth are biologically immortal in the sense that they are not vulnerable to disease or the effects of old age (closer to the concept of indefinite lifespan than true immortality). Although they can be killed in battle like humans and may alternately wither away from grief, their spirits only pass to the blessed land in the west called Valinor, whereas humans' souls leave the world entirely. Tolkien is also responsible for reviving the older and less-used terms elven and elvish rather than Edmund Spenser's invented elfin and elfish (when editors corrected the term to the latter, Tolkien himself was quick to write a correction into the next printing). He probably preferred the word elf over fairy because elf is of Anglo-Saxon origin while fairy entered English from French. He certainly felt the need to differentiate elves, as only one kind of the creatures of fa√´rie, from other inhabitants of that land, and lamented the confusion in English between fairy (fa√´rie) and fairy (fay or elf). Tolkien also wished to distinguish his elves from the diminutive airy-winged fairies popularized by Drayton's Nymphidia.Tolkien, J. R. R. (1964). \\"On Fairy-Stories\\". Tree and Leaf. George Allen and Unwin Ltd. Reprinted in Tolkien, J. R. R. (1966). The Tolkien Reader. Ballantine Books: New York The archer Legolas Greenleaf, here portrayed by Orlando Bloom in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, is arguably Tolkien's best known elf. Like nearly all others in Middle-Earth, rarely do the elves display any kind of \\"active\\" magic found in later fantasy works, but are nonetheless deemed \\"magic\\" by the lesser races, due to their vast number of superhuman abilities (keen senses such as sharper hearing and sight, even to the point of night vision, resting the mind and travel simultaneously, foresight, some kind of telepathy, power to control nature to some extent, such as summoning floods, and the power to conjure visions of the past). Items made by the elves also seem to have enhanced properties, such as the Silmarils, the Palantiri, the \\"Lamps of Noldor\\" and eventually the Rings of Power. Other artifacts appearing in The Lord of the Rings are the appealing lembas bread capable of keeping a \\"traveller on his feet for a day of long labour\\", the reinvigorating beverage miruvor, the unusual hithlain rope, which is strong, tough, light, long, soft to the hand, packs close and, even seems to unknot itself to one's command. The elven-cloaks the Fellowship receive from the elves were thought to be \\"magic cloaks\\" by Pippin, and although the elves neither confirmed nor denied this; those cloaks function similarly to the cloak of invisibility often used in works of fiction. Lord Thranduil of the Mirkwood Elves used \\"magic doors\\" to guard his palace, making it almost impossible for anyone to enter or exit against his will. Certain gifts Galadriel gave to the Fellowship of the Ring, such as Frodo's phial and Sam's box of earth from the gardens of Galadriel, also seem to possess magical properties. This elven \\"magic\\" is different from the power of Sauron, as Galadriel stated to Frodo and Sam. Dead elves are normally re-embodied after an indefinite period of time ‚Äì according to Tolkien's Letters and other posthumously published writings. In the posthumously published The Silmarillion, elves are mentioned as the \\"firstborn\\", the first children of Il√∫vatar, the god of Tolkien's legendarium. The elves are sorted into two main kindreds: the Eldar and the Avari. The Eldar were divided into three groups: the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri. In Tolkien's writings, the Noldor, the Sindar and the Silvan Elves, the last two being subdivisions of the Teleri, are the most prominent. The elves were summoned by the Valar to live with them in Valinor, long before the appearance of men and flourished in stature, craft and lore. In \\"Laws and Customs among the Eldar\\", published in The History of Middle-earth, Tolkien elaborates on elvish sexuality, reproduction, and sexual norms. The Eldar view the sexual act as extremely special and intimate, for it leads to the conception and birth of children. Extramarital and premarital sex would be considered contradictions in terms, and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Despite their longevity, the Eldar have generally few children with relatively sizable intervals between each child (their numbers are stated to be in steady decline by the Third Age). Their libido eventually wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the \\"union of love\\", and they consider the period of bearing and raising children as the happiest stage of their lives. =Other examples of elves= * In the Dark fantasy Manga and anime series Berserk, Elves are described as astral beings which hail from the kingdom of Elfhelm, the domain of Sovereign Hanafubuku. The elves Puck and Ivalera are the two most prominent elfin characters, both of which travel with Guts in his traveling party. * Philip Mazza's The Harrow takes a different approach to elves, in a post- apocalyptic fantasy world. Elves are of the En' Edan in the old tongue, or of the races of man and similar origins, those of the good and righteous. In Mazza's first book The Harrow: From Under a Tree, the first appearance of elves is described as follows: \\"Dressed in pure white and with long black hair was a fair-skinned elf, the Elf-King to be exact, and his name was Dalgaes. Faithfully by the Elf-King‚Äôs side was the archer Tinnfierl, a slim elf with auburn hair, wearing a mixture of tan leather and green cloth, and with bow and arrow strapped to his back.\\" For Mazza, there are many of the En' Edan, to include the elves or En' Edhel, the race of dwarfs or the En' Naug, and those of man who reside in the northern wastelands of the Crag or the Mur' Edan. * Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy focuses heavily on a long- lived, golden-skinned, magical race known as the Sithi, which are described as elves in all but name. Despite the medieval European setting, the Sithi are Asian-influenced in their names and clothing. They also are quite different physically from humans, to the point of having recognizably different bone structure. * Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle also features elves of a highly Tolkienesque persuasion. * Wendy and Richard Pini's long-running comic book series Elfquest attempts to avoid the usual Tolkienesque elven clich√©s by placing their elves in a setting inspired by Native American, rather than European, mythology. It later turns out that the elves are actually the descendants of a shape-shifting alien race rather than mythological beings. * Guy Gavriel Kay's Fionavar Tapestry series includes both lios alfar (light elves) and swart alfar (dark elves), using variations on the original Norse or Icelandic terms. They play parts corresponding, respectively, to Tolkien's elves and to his goblins (different from orcs). * Gael Baudino's Strands of Starlight series centers around elves who appear human, aside from slightly pointed ears. Formed by the living universe at the Earth's inception for healing and aid to all living creatures, they can be killed and die from grief, but do not die of old age. Their spiritual powers allow them to change the physical world at will, see in the dark, talk to plants and animals, heal anything short of death, and see the future and past. Natil, the eldest of them, is four and a half billion years old. * Elves appear in The Spiderwick Chronicles as one of the species of faery. They are depicted as a hierarchized society that rules all the other faery species. They hate humankind because of the destruction they bring onto nature and do their utmost to keep knowledge of faeries hidden from them. They are loyal to their word and their society is shaped as a reference to the faery courts of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. * In Luc Besson's animated trilogy Arthur and the Minimoys and the book series on which they're based on, there is a race of elves with African descent called the Minimoys (in the American version they are referred to as \\"Invisibles\\"), who are extremely tiny, 2 mm tall, and it is very difficult for them to be seen with the naked eye. They have the usual pointy ears and big eyes and they can be thousands of years old. It is revealed that a thousand Minimoy years is equivalent to ten human years. Their world is somewhat of a mix of modern and medieval era. It is also possible for humans to turn into Minimoys through a special ritual. *In the Nickelodeon show Mysticons, elves are depicted as possessing longevity, superhuman hearing and enhanced eyesight, and perpetual youth. Some have pale brownish skin and pointed ears. The most known elf is the 110-year-old Piper Willowbrook (whose elvish name is Pyperia Ashryn Elvaniski), who has chosen to be the acrobatic Mysticon Striker in the second generation of legendary Mysticons. An old woman, who is half elf and half spider, is Hortensia Q. Sparklebottom who runs a clocked orphanage for special children who had lost their family as infants. In \\"The Princess and the Pirate\\" introduced ancient \\"moon elves\\" who defend the world Gemina from monsters far outside the astral plane. * In The Stolen Magic book, an elven illusionist named Amilmeth absorbs Zarya Moonwolf her weaponry and abilities as the second Mysticon Ranger *In the Netflix series The Dragon Prince there are six different types of elf, each type corresponding to one of the six primal sources of magic. They are depicted as human sized and with the typical pointed ears, but also with horns on their heads, four fingers per hand, and various skin and hair colors depending on type. Elves in games Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game) tend to be beautiful, fair, and close in size to humans (usually taller, sometimes shorter). A hallmark of fantasy elves is also their long and pointed ears. In gaming, and to some extent fantasy literature, elves as a rule have a greater depth of knowledge (especially regarding magic) than their human counterparts, due to a racial inclination as well as their extreme age. Typically, they are also capable warriors, following Legolas, arguably Tolkien's most well-known elf. As in the Norse lore, elven-human unions and offspring were possible in Tolkien's saga (a notable example being Elrond, the lord of Rivendell), and in many RPGs, half-elven is a possible race for player characters. Fantasy elves frequently divide up into subraces, such as the High Elves, Wood Elves and Dark Elves found in the Warhammer fantasy game setting. Especially dark elves (popularized by TSR as \\"drow\\") are a common theme in many other fantasy games and to some extent literature. Apart from malice, drow or dark elves are often depicted as being dark-skinned and living underground. = Dungeons & Dragons = In the modern treatment of elves in Dungeons & Dragons, they are divided up into subraces that include Aquatic Elves, Gray Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves, and Drow. The Forgotten Realms campaign setting's elves (or Tel'Quessir as they call themselves) differ still, replacing the High Elves and Gray Elves with Moon or Silver Elves and Sun or Gold Elves, and adding Wild or Green Elves, Star or Mithral Elves and Avariel (Winged Elves) to the Aquatic (Sea) Elves, Wood (Copper) Elves, Drow (Dark Elves), and Lythari (elves that transform into wolves). = GURPS = The Generic Universal RolePlaying System (GURPS) Fourth Edition deals with a wide variety of types of Elves. Discworld Roleplaying Game (which uses the GURPS system) describes the Elves of the Discworld series in addition to the Typical Elf, Royal Elf, and Elf-Kin. GURPS Basic Set: Characters, GURPS Banestorm, GURPS Fantasy, and Dungeon Fantasy Adventurers, part of the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game (which uses GURPS rules), each have a different template for the \\"standard\\" Elf. Other variations in those books and in GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level include the Dark Elf, Half-Elf (two versions), High Elf, Mountain Elf, Sea Elf (two versions), Shadow Elf, Winged Elf, and Wood Elf. Third Edition supplements with different variations, including the Deep Elf, include GURPS Fantasy (for Third Edition) and GURPS Fantasy Folk. = Warhammer franchise = In the Warhammer franchise, the first civilized people of the world were the High Elves (Asur) from the Atlantis-like (though unsunken) island realm of Ulthuan. Early on, the High Elves colonized large parts of the Warhammer world, but following the rise of the Druchii (called \\"Dark Elves\\" by others than themselves), a fascistoid movement of corsairs and slavers, the High Elves were plunged into civil war and their power greatly faded. Their civil war was followed decades later by a costly war with the Dwarfs, which saw the Elves expelled from many of their colonies, reducing their civilisation to only Ulthuan. Many of the elves who were expelled from their former colonies took up residence in the deep forests of the Old World, and with time became known as Wood Elves (Asrai). The three kindreds of elves in Warhammer are not separate species but rather separate national groups which epitomise the moral and emotional extremes of the powerful elven psyche ‚Äì The High Elves are elves at their most noble, morally upright and fair, the Dark elves are elves at their most cruel, vicious and debased. The Wood Elves combine aspects of both in their behaviour, seeming fickle, capricious and dangerously inconstant to outsiders. Unlike Tolkien's elves, those of the Warhammer world are not known to interbreed with humans ‚Äì a consistent feature of their design in recent years being a concern to differentiate them as much as possible from humans, who they might otherwise begin to resemble too closely. Further, while they may bear physical similarity to the works of Tolkien, GW writers have stated on a number of occasions that their elves where based on the works of Poul Anderson. Warhammer is also unique in the aspect that Warhammer 40,000, the science fantasy version of the game, features space faring elves under the name of Eldar (a term borrowed from Tolkien) ‚Äì an ancient race that once served the Old Ones and in the aftermath of a great catastrophe have split into four distinct groups, the Craftworld Eldar, the rustic Eldar Exodites (dinosaur riding eldar in self-imposed exile) the mysterious and acrobatic Harlequins and the fallen kindred, the Dark Eldar. = Warcraft franchise = Azeroth, a high fantasy world of the Warcraft franchise created by Blizzard Entertainment, originally featured elves similar to the Warhammer High or Wood Elves. The series introduced the naturalistic violet-skinned Night Elves in Warcraft III, a real-time strategy game, who were portrayed more favorably than traditional dark-skinned elves. These elves, who are among the oldest known races in Azeroth, descended from a tribe of the now extinct Dark Trolls ‚Äì other races of elves descend from the Night Elves. Despite starting off as magic practitioners, they eventually abandon the use of arcane magic and focus on the powers afforded to them over nature. The High Elves, the outcast of the Night Elves, face the destruction of their kingdom, Quel'Thalas, and its capital, Silvermoon, at the hands of the Scourge. The survivors are thereafter known as Blood Elves and, due to the destruction of the magically-powerful Sunwell, become aware of their magical addiction. This faction was at one point part of the alliance alongside the humans, but abandoned the alliance following the events of Warcraft III. During the events of World of Warcraft: Legion, two new factions of elves, the Nightborne (a subspecies of Night Elf with an affinity for arcane magic) and the Void Elves (Blood Elves who have embraced the power of the Void), were introduced. Night Elves, Blood Elves, Nightborne, and Void Elves are playable races in the World of Warcraft MMORPG. In Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard's crossover MOBA game, players can control several elf characters from the Warcraft universe. Tyrande, Malfurion, Kael'thas, as well as Sylvanas and Illidan, are examples of playable elf heroes in the game. Numerous cards with the card art depicting Night Elves and Blood Elves are present in digital collectible card game Hearthstone. = The Elder Scrolls universe = The universe of The Elder Scrolls computer games also features distinct races of elves (or Mer as they refer to themselves) including High Elves (Altmer), Dark Elves (Dunmer, formerly the Chimer or Velothi) and their offshoot the Cantemiric Velothi, Wood Elves (Bosmer), Wild Elves (Ayleid), Snow Elves (Falmer), Sea Elves (Maormer), and the ancestors of all elves, the Aldmer. Within The Elder Scrolls universe, both the \\"Dwarves\\" (Dwemer, who are not actually of short stature) and the Orcs (Orsimer) are elven-derived races.The Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion One of the human races in The Elder Scrolls universe, the Bretons, also has some elven ancestry, though interbreeding, and this is said for account for their facility for the magical arts. Khajiits are also Mer the Khajiit are derived from the old Aldmeri pantheon (same as all mer races). They are the product of the Daedric prince Azurah. Azurah, had been given a gift by their mother Fadomai to take one of Nirni's children (the various human and mer races of Tamriel), and reshape them to her own liking, so long as she made them the fastest, cleverest, and most beautiful of all creatures. Azurah chose a group of forest dwellers among Nirni's children, and from them, she formed the Khajiit. = Heroes of Might and Magic series = In the Heroes of Might and Magic series, Elves are divided into two sub-species: Wood Elves, and Snow Elves. Wood Elves are from the wooded kingdom of AvLee which lies in eastern Antagarich. They are descendants and cousins of the Vori elves. Snow Elves a.k.a. Vori Elves or \\"true elves\\", are from the icy isle of Vori, which lies north of the continent of Antagarich in Heroes of Might and Magic 3 and its expansions. = RuneScape = RuneScape features elves as a race in the game's fictional world of Gielinor. They dwell to the west in the land of Tirannwn. Elves once inhabited much of the Kingdom of Kandarin under Queen Glarial and King Baxtorian, but following the death of Glarial and the disappearance of Baxtorian, retreated west over the mountains, and their continued presence in the world has passed out of the common knowledge of most other races. Some elves mistrust humans, dwarves, gnomes and trolls, and humans may not enter their capital city of Prifddinas. The elves follow the goddess Seren, who led them to Gielinor through the 'World Gate' during the First Age. One elf dwells within the Champions' Guild as the elven champion, while a number of elves serve in the Army Recruitment and Mobilisation Society as formidable wielders of magic. The 'dark elves' of the Iorwerth clan have taken over the elven capital of Prifddinas and turned against the elves to serve a \\"Dark Lord\\". Members of the Iorwerth clan are also present in and under the supposedly plague-stricken human city of West Ardougne, disguised as plague doctors. There are also some remaining elves of the other clans, who are now forced to hide as they fight to take back power, and now reside within the hidden lodge of Lletya, as well as within other small camps and areas across Tirannwn. = Other appearances = * In the role-playing game The Burning Wheel, Elves have a unique attribute, Grief. Grief is the result of living an endless life, while watching tragedy, death and destruction unfold. Elves who advance their Grief attribute past a certain point, wither away, or pass on to the West. Elves in Burning Wheel are otherwise much like their Tolkien counterparts. * Dark Age of Camelot features elves as a playable race in the realm of Hibernia. These elves are supposedly based on the Celtic Sidhe, however bear a striking resemblance to the more human inspired elves of typical D&D; fantasy lore. * Nevendaar, the world in the game Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and its expansions features a nation of elves called the Elven Alliance, consisting of the Noble Elves and the Wild Elves, both created by their god Gallean. * The science fiction role-playing game Fading Suns features the fictional extraterrestrial races of the Ur-Obun and the Ur-Ukar, which are essentially science fiction renditions of elves and dark elves (somewhat akin to the Eldar and the Dark Eldar in the setting of Warhammer 40000 mentioned above). * The Final Fantasy series features elves and elf-like races in some of its titles, including the Elvaan of Final Fantasy XI and the Elezen of Final Fantasy XIV, the latter of which are also referred to as elves explicitly within certain regions. * Elves of Glorantha (setting for the role- playing games RuneQuest and HeroQuest) share little with Tolkien's elves but their connection with forests and their preference of archery ‚Äì they are mobile, humanoid plants. * In The Legend of Zelda series, there are many humanoid races that possess features similar to elves, such as pointed ears. This includes the Hylians, the race that the series's protagonist, Link, belongs to. The Kokiri race has aspects of both the Romance traditions of fairies, which were often conflated with elves, and more modern interpretations of fairies as small, insect-like magical creatures. * In the role-playing game Perfect World International elves are portrayed as winged elves. The Winged Elves have small wings on their head (only for appearances) and wings on their back for which they can use to fly to certain places. The Winged Elves are in tune with nature and use magic or bow and arrows. The Winged Elves reside in the City of the Plume, a unique city filled with trees where most of the houses are built in trees. * The Tales series of video games features elves in some of its titles, including Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Phantasia. Tales of Vesperia also features a race of elf-like beings known as Krityans. Countering the Tolkien tradition Conversely, elves of the Tolkien mould have become standardized staple characters of modern fantasy to such an extent that breaking the norms for how an elf is supposed to be and behave has become an end in itself. * Wendy and Richard Pini's Elfquest comics (and novels) have elves descended from a shapechanging spacefaring race, adapted to the world where they were stranded first by magic, then in part by a shapechanger crossbreeding with wolves, and breeding that bloodline with some of the original elves. The resulting wolfrider elves are diminutive in stature and have a neolithic culture (trading few metal items with other races). * An early example of this would possibly be the Krynnish elves of the Dragonlance series. Although superficially similar to standard fantasy elves, these elves were much more morally ambiguous and less consistently sympathetic, and were prone to blaming humans for any calamities which occurred in the world, as well as engaging in periodic bouts of genocidal conflict. * The parodic Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett feature extradimensional creatures called elves that go back to the old myths of cradle-robbing fairies. The Discworld elves have no imagination or real emotions, and therefore such things as children, artists and musicians fascinate them. They also have copper based blood and are extremely vulnerable to iron (as it disrupts their finely tuned magnetism-based senses), and therefore use stone-headed elf-shot for their arrows. Though actually only vaguely humanoid in appearance, they bewitch humans with their \\"glamour\\", making themselves seem incomparably fair and godlike, and worthy of worship. Eventually, they subdue us through sheer charisma, and only strength of mind and avoiding superstition (which they feed on) can keep them at bay. Elves in Pratchett's world represent the dangers of submitting oneself uncritically to the supernatural or to the superficially attractive (which would probably include a substantial amount of modern obsessions). The books Lords and Ladies and The Wee Free Men are about an encounter with \\"the fair folk\\". Pratchett describes them like this: * The best-selling Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling features house-elves who are slaves that resemble brownies or goblins more than modern high fantasy elves. Rather like the elves (\\"Wichtelm√§nner\\" in the German tale) in The Shoemaker and the Elves, Rowling's house-elves are released from servitude when they are given clothes. They also refer to themselves in the third person. * Radiata Stories features beings called Light Elves which have an appearance more like a fairy or pixie than of a traditional elf. * Elves in the best-selling Artemis Fowl series are portrayed quite differently from those in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Being only about a meter in height, Elves have pointed ears, skin that is brown rather than Tolkien's fair or the black attributed to Dark Elves in other influential works, reddish hair, and are one of the several species that make up the technologically advanced Fairy society. The Fairies are long-lived but not ageless, and are all subterranean and nocturnal, with sunlight having deleterious effects on their magic. Their magic is usually shown as being used for invisibility, healing and hypnotism, though a subset known as warlocks can use more substantial magic; until the fifth book all warlocks are said to be Elfin. Nearly all Elfin characters who appear in the series are in the Fairy military police, and therefore usually in possession of laser guns. It is stated that the species loves flying, both in crafts and with mechanical wings. The main Elfin characters in the Artemis Fowl series are Captain Holly Short and Commander Julius Root. * In Robert A. Heinlein's science fiction novel The Puppet Masters, a race of methane-breathing elf-like beings inhabit Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. There elves are described as being a bit smaller than humans and having \\"a little rosebud mouth, which seems always smiling\\". They fall victim to terrifying slug-like parasites, capable of attaching themselves to any living being and completely controlling him, her or it. The parasites, riding on elves' shoulders, then try to do the same on Earth but are repulsed after much fighting, and at the end of the book humans head for Titan to settle accounts with the parasites and try to save the elves. * In Mercedes Lackey's SERRAted edge universe elves are tied to humans. Neither race can live without the other, unlike Tolkien's aloof and separate elves. Also, the elves in her universe work on and race cars professionally, not something usually seen in high fantasy. * In Elizabeth Moon's trilogy The Deed of Paksenarrion features, as well as elves of the Tolkien type, another kind called the iynisin or the unsingers. Where the elves believe the singer made the world so they sing to make things, the iynisin try to unsing creation, corrupt and destroy. * In the comic book series Poison Elves, writer/artist Drew Hayes depicted elves as rogues, thieves, and killers rather than the peace-loving forest dwellers depicted by Tolkien. His central character, Lusiphur is a trench coat wearing, urban creature more apt to sulk in a tavern than frolic and sing in the woods. An assassin, Lusiphur is prone to fits of violence ‚Äì often slaughtering hordes for the slightest insult or minor inconvenience. His weapons alternate between knives and swords and a magic pistol with an unlimited supply of ammunition (rather than the longbow associated with characters such as Tolkien's Legolas). * In the Warcraft series, the High Elves, a Tolkien-modeled society, experience a fall from grace when their homeland is overrun by the undead Scourge. Their seeming perfection is revealed to be full of holes, as a latent addiction to magical forces begins to corrupt the few surviving members of their race. Eventually, they become the Blood Elves, taking on a vengeful mindset and gradually becoming dependent on demonic magic to sate their addiction. Most telling about the change in their character is that they have apparently enslaved a being of pure Light in order to gain powers normally reserved for the good- hearted Paladins. Likewise, the night elves ‚Äì who are on the opposing faction to the blood elves ‚Äì appear to be inspired by the traditionally evil drow of Dungeons & Dragons, but given a more noble twist. Although not explicitly good, they are very dedicated to eradicating the Burning Legion, one of the main antagonistic forces in the Warcraft universe. * In the Magic: The Gathering universe, the elves trade in their divinity and immortality for a greater affinity with nature. they are often shown shunning all manner of artifice and metal, instead favoring weapons made of wood and trained animals. Their knowledge of magic shifts from the classic arcane spellcasting and focuses on nature aligned spells such as blending in, animating wood, controlling animals, and entering predatory rages. A notable exception is the Lorwyn elves, whose obsessions with beauty occlude everything else. * In the Korean video game Mabinogi, the elves are portrayed as a tribal, desert- dwelling race that is cursed to wither away into a monster, and as a consequence die young. They generally fit the Tolkien archetype in other ways, however, being focused towards speed over durability and skilled in archery. * In the Dragon Age universe, elves are split into the nominal factions of the Dalish ‚Äì forest-dwelling nomads more akin to Tolkien's own elves ‚Äì and \\"city\\" or \\"alienage\\" elves. City elves are second-class \\"low men\\" with stunted lifespans compared to the marginally longer-lived Dalish. Likewise, city elves are forced into filthy slums in human cities rather than exotic or elegant elven cities. * In the Shadowrun universe, the video games and novels feature human children who begin to be born as elves, dwarves, and other exotic creatures. Shadowrun combines the genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime. Portrayal in film * Crow the elf is a role in the 1980 swords and sorcery film Hawk the Slayer, possessing archery skills of superhuman speed. * In the 1986 fantasy film Legend, a young man is aided in his quest to save a unicorn by a band of wood elves, most notably their leader, Honeythorn Gump. In the film, elves appear to age backwards, as observable by the elder Gump being younger in appearance than his fellows and by one of the elves remarking, \\"I'm not as old as I used to be!\\" while picking himself up after a tumble. * Most adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's books ‚Äì The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies in particular ‚Äì as well as the Harry Potter series, feature elves as supporting characters. *Dark elves are featured as major antagonists in fantasy superhero movies Hellboy II: The Golden Army and Thor: The Dark World, as well as in low fantasy TV series Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. *High Elves of Azeroth briefly appear in the Warcraft film adaptation. *In The Shannara Chronicles TV series, elves are among the major protagonists. * Elves and their connection to Swedish folklore are dealt with in the Swedish horror film Marianne.

Ren√© Descartes is a prominent French philosopher who wrote Meditations on First Philosophy. The goal of the Meditations is to build a foundation in which we can learn about the sciences and trust the accuracy of existence. Since writing this work Descartes has received many objections and criticisms. Descartes argues ‚Äì for example, in the third of his Meditations on First Philosophy ‚Äì that whatever one clearly and distinctly perceives is true: \\"I now seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true.\\" (AT VII 35)\\"AT\\" refers to Oeuvres de Descartes, ed. by Charles Adam and Paul Tannery. He goes on in the same Meditation to argue for the existence of a benevolent God, in order to defeat his skeptical argument in the first Meditation that God might be a deceiver. He then says that without his knowledge of God's existence, none of his knowledge could be certain. The cartesian circle is an objection to Descartes argument. Descartes has many objectors including Antoine Arnauld who poses an objection to Descartes' Truth Rule.  Cartesian Circle Argument  The Cartesian circle is a criticism of the above that takes this form: # Descartes' proof of the reliability of clear and distinct perceptions takes as a premise God's existence as a non-deceiver. # Descartes' proofs of God's existence presuppose the reliability of clear and distinct perceptions. Thus, Descartes' argument is circular. Descartes is accused of circularity regarding the Truth Rule because it appears that the Truth Rule is contingent on God‚Äôs existence.The Truth Rule states whatever I perceive to clearly and distinctly believe to belong to something truly does belong to it. The Truth Rule is contingent on God‚Äôs existence. However, we can only know of God‚Äôs existence by being able to clearly and distinctly perceive of this. A circular argument is one in which a premise in an argument includes with the argument‚Äôs conclusion. The cartesian circle is an error in reasoning, that has made Descartes' argument circular. Descartes is guilty of circular reasoning due to the fact that a premise of his argument is included in the conclusion of his argument because the rule of truth is contingent upon God‚Äôs existence. The rule of truth is contingent on God‚Äôs existence. However, we can only know of God‚Äôs existence by being able to clearly and distinctly perceive of this. Another worry that arises from Arnauld‚Äôs rejection is the worry of how we can ever come to know of the foundational principles that are needed in order to have knowledge. We can only know something through the foundations of knowledge so a question of interest that arises is how does one know the foundations of knowledge. Descartes' contemporaries Many commentators, both at the time that Descartes wrote and since, have argued that this involves a circular argument, as he relies upon the principle of clarity and distinctness to argue for the existence of God, and then claims that God is the guarantor of his clear and distinct ideas. The first person to raise this criticism was Marin Mersenne, in the \\"Second Set of Objections\\" to the Meditations: > \\"you are not yet certain of the existence of God, and you say that you are > not certain of anything. It follows from this that you do not yet clearly > and distinctly know that you are a thinking thing, since, on your own > admission, that knowledge depends on the clear knowledge of an existing God; > and this you have not proved in the passage where you draw the conclusion > that you clearly know what you are.\\" (AT VII 124‚Äì125) Descartes' own response to this criticism, in his \\"Author's Replies to the Fourth Set of Objections\\", is first to give what has become known as the Memory response; he points out that in the fifth Meditation (at AT VII 69‚Äì70) he did not say that he needed God to guarantee the truth of his clear and distinct ideas, only to guarantee his memory: > \\"when I said that we can know nothing for certain until we are aware that > God exists, I expressly declared that I was speaking only of knowledge of > those conclusions which can be recalled when we are no longer attending to > the arguments by means of which we deduced them.\\" (AT VII 140) Ren√© Descartes Secondly, he explicitly denies that the cogito is an inference: \\"When someone says 'I am thinking, therefore I am, or I exist' he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a syllogism, but recognizes it as something self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind.\\" (AT VII 140) Finally, he points out that the certainty of clear and distinct ideas does not depend upon God's guarantee (AT VII 145‚Äì146). The cogito in particular is self-verifying, indubitable, immune to the strongest doubt. Antoine Arnauld is another one of Descartes objectors. He objected to Descartes' argument regarding what is referred to as The Truth Rule. Arnauld accuses Descartes of circular reasoning. He says Descartes reasons in a circle because according to Descartes since we know that God exists what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. However, according to Descartes we are certain that God exists because we can clearly and distinctly perceive this. Arnauld states that before we can come to the conclusion of God‚Äôs existence we must be sure that whatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. In this objection, Arnauld is stating that God‚Äôs existence cannot be used to prove that what one clearly and distinctly perceives is true. Another worry that arises from Arnauld‚Äôs rejection is the worry of how we can ever come to know of the foundational principles that are needed in order to have knowledge. We can only know something through the foundations of knowledge so a question of interest that arises is how does one know the foundations of knowledge. Modern commentators Bernard Williams presents the memory defense as follows: \\"When one is actually intuiting a given proposition, no doubt can be entertained. So any doubt there can be must be entertained when one is not intuiting the proposition.\\" (p. 206) He goes on to argue: \\"The trouble with Descartes's system is not that it is circular; nor that there is an illegitimate relation between the proofs of God and the clear and distinct perceptions [...] The trouble is that the proofs of God are invalid and do not convince even when they are supposedly being intuited\\". (p. 210) As Andrea Christofidou explains: > \\"The distinction appropriate here is that between cognitio and scientia; > both are true and cannot be contradicted, but the latter is objectively true > and certain (with the guarantee of God), while the former is subjectively > true and certain, that is, time-bound, and objectively possible (and does > not need the guarantee of God).\\" (pp 219‚Äì220) Another defense of Descartes against the charge of circularity is developed by Harry Frankfurt in his book Demons, Dreamers, and Madmen: the Defense of Reason in Descartes' Meditations (Bobbs‚ÄìMerrill, 1970; reprinted by Princeton University Press, 2007). Frankfurt suggests that Descartes' arguments for the existence of God, and for the reliability of reason, are not intended to prove that their conclusions are absolutely true, but to show that reason can be compelled to accept them, even in the face of radical skeptical arguments. In fact, according to Frankfurt, the validation of reason is accomplished by the rejection of the main sceptical hypothesis, which is the first real (albeit negative) conclusion of the argument, whilst the proposition about God's existence is a merely preparatory step. It must be conceded that once reached the real conclusion of the argument, the Cartesian method would forbid the sceptic to reply that perhaps the cartesian proof was suggested to the meditator by the evil genius itself, in the first place (thereby accusing Descartes of vicious circularity). This accusation fails, since it requires the evil genius' existence to be still deemed (at least) a possibility ‚Äì an idea which precisely, after the expanded \\"God's proof\\" the meditator has acquired a specific reason to reject. However, according to Frankfurt the proof presupposes the validity of the principle of non-contradiction, since otherwise an argument leading to the (provisional) conclusion that a benevolent God exists, wouldn't force Descartes to reject the possible existence of the demon. Thus the proof might, after all, beg the question against a kind of skepticism radical enough to put in doubt the rule of non- contradiction. Moreover, according to Frankfurt's Descartes, the meditator feels forced to accept his conclusion merely because of the evidence of the supporting argument, while Frankfurt himself started by explaining that the radical doubt is meant to be a criticism of evidence as a criterion of truth (even subjective truth, if you want). As Frankfurt pointed out, it seems hard to deny that the general proposition \\"evident statements can be false or misleading\\" can be thought without hindrance, and that Descartes seems to have countenanced this kind of doubt, when close to the end of the First Meditation he wrote that > \\"...as I sometimes think that others are in error respecting matters of > which they believe themselves to possess a perfect knowledge, how do I know > that I am not also deceived each time I add together two and three, or > number the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more simple, if > more simple indeed can be imagined?\\" The outcome seems to be that a doubt aimed at evident ideas is supposed by Frankfurt to be overcome by means of a further evident idea, thereby begging the question.

It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold. It is extremely similar to the much rarer grey long-eared bat which was only validated as a distinct species in the 1960s. An adult brown long-eared bat has a body length of 4.5-4.8 cm, a tail of 4.1-4.6 cm, and a forearm length of 4-4.2 cm. The ears are 3.3-3.9 cm in length, and readily distinguish the long-eared bats from most other bat species. They are relatively slow flyers compared to other bat species. Habitat It is found throughout Europe, with the exception of Greece, southern Italy and southern Spain. It is found to the east up to the Urals and Caucasus. \\"Plecotus auritus\\", Science for Nature Foundation The UK distribution can be found on the National Biodiversity Network website and can be seen here. Brown long eared bats regularly utilise buildings roosting in undisturbed roof spaces either singly, in crevices and timber, or in clusters around chimneys and ridge ends. This species also roosts in treeholes, bat boxes and caves which are important as winter hibernation sites. The roosts in trees may be close to the ground. Emergence from roost sites usually only occurs in the dark, around an hour after sunset.Russ, J. 1999. The Bats of Britain and Ireland. Echolocation calls, sound analysis, and species identification. Powys: Alana Books. It hunts above woodland, often by day, and mostly for moths, gleaning insects from leaves and bark. Prey is probably detected by sight and sound using the large eyes and ears, not by echolocation. A study by Ekl√∂f and Jones (2003)Ekl√∂f, J. & Jones, G. 2003. Use of vision in prey detection by brown long-eared bats, Plecotus auritus. Animal Behaviour, 66, 949-953. demonstrated the ability of the brown long-eared bat to visually detect prey. Under experimental conditions, brown long-eared bats showed a preference for situations where sonar and visual cues were available. However, visual cues were more important than sonar cues and the bats were unable to detect prey items using only sonar cues. Brown long-eared bats have relatively large eyes and ears and it is likely that visual information and passive listening allow this species to detect prey in cluttered environments. Echolocation Echolocation is used to find prey. The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 27‚Äì56 kHz, have most energy at 35 kHz and have an average duration of 2.5 ms. However, unlike most bats, the long-eared can hunt by hearing alone. Their hearing is sensitive enough to hear a moth in flight. This hunting strategy evolved because prey items, namely certain moth species evolved the ability to hear the echolocation and take evading action. TParsons, S. and Jones, G.

The definition of what constitutes transmediation would depend on how medium is defined or interpreted. In Understanding media, Marshall McLuhan offered a quite broad definition of a medium as \\"an extension of ourselves\\": > \\"In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all > things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be > reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. > This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any > medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale > that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by > any new technology.\\" From McLuhan's definition, it is possible to infer the definition of transmediation could involve at least two different dimensions: a sensory and semiotic translation. When referring to medium as a sensory mode, transmediation would require to move between sensory modes (e.g., visual to aural, aural to tactile). When referring to transmediation as semiotic translation, transmediation can refer to the process of \\"responding to cultural texts in a range of sign systems -- art, movement, sculpture, dance, music, and so on -- as well as in words.\\" Semali and Fueyo Transmediation may utilize more than one media form. All the components of a transmediated work are interlinked with each other to form the whole network. Therefore, transmediated works are closely linked to semiotics and technology in the context of digital media. Transmediation can include response to traditional printed texts, as well as multimedia materials including video, animation, a website, a podcast, a game, etc. Transmediation is closely linked to semiotics, which is the impact study of signs. Academic researchers and educators interested in transmediation are often also interested in media literacy, visual literacy, information literacy, and critical literacy. Leonard Shlain highlights the importance of engaging students in the process of transmediation when writing, \\"Digital information comes in multiple forms, and students must learn to tell stories not just with words and numbers but also through images, graphics, color, sound, music, and dance. There is a grammar and literacy to each of these forms of communication. Bombarded with a wide variety of images regularly, students need sharp visual-interpretation skills to interact with the media analytically. Each form of communication has its own rules and grammar and should be taught in ways that lead students to be more purposeful, specific, and concise in communicating.\\"  See also  * Transmedia storytelling * Intertextuality  References  Category:Media studies Category:Intertextuality fr:Transm√©dialit√© ","title":"Transmediation"},{"id":"2355976","text":"Rossini portrayed in 1828, the year he began composing William Tell The William Tell Overture is the overture to the opera William Tell (original French title Guillaume Tell), whose music was composed by Gioachino Rossini. William Tell premiered in 1829 and was the last of Rossini's 39 operas, after which he went into semi-retirement (he continued to compose cantatas, sacred music and secular vocal music). The overture is in four parts, each following without pause. There has been repeated use (and sometimes parody) of parts of this overture in both classical music and popular media. It was the theme music for The Lone Ranger in radio, television and film,Studwell, William Emmett (1997). The Americana Song Reader. Routledge, pp. 90‚Äì91. and has become widely associated with horseback riding since then. Two different parts were also used as theme music for the British television series The Adventures of William Tell, the fourth part (popularly identified in the US with The Lone Ranger) in the UK, and the third part, rearranged as a stirring march, in the US. Franz Liszt prepared a piano transcription of the overture in 1838 (S.552) which became a staple of his concert repertoire.Hamilton, Kenneth (2005). The Cambridge Companion to Liszt. Cambridge University Press, p. 82. There are also transcriptions by other composers, including versions by Louis Gottschalk for two and four pianos and a duet for piano and violin.Starr, S. Frederick (2000). Louis Moreau Gottschalk. University of Illinois Press, pp. 84 and 180. Instrumentation The overture is scored for: a piccolo, a flute, two oboes (first or second oboe doubles a cor anglais), two clarinets in A, two bassoons, four French horns in G and E, two trumpets in E, three trombones, timpani, triangle, bass drum and cymbals, and strings. Structure The overture, which lasts for approximately 12 minutes, paints a musical picture of life in the Swiss Alps, the setting of the opera.Kinscella, Hazel Gertrude (1941/2005). Music and Romance. Kessinger Publishing, pp. 389‚Äì390. . It was described by Hector Berlioz, who usually loathed Rossini's works, as \\"a symphony in four parts.\\"Rous, Samuel Holland (1921). The Victrola Book of the Opera 6th Edition. Victor Talking Machine Company, p. 426. But unlike an actual symphony with its distinct movements, the overture's parts transition from one to the next without a break. Prelude: Dawn The prelude is a slow passage in E major, scored for five solo cellos accompanied by double basses. It begins in E minor with a solo cello which is in turn 'answered' by the remaining cellos and the double basses. An impending storm is hinted at by two very quiet timpani rolls resembling distant thunder. The section ends with a very high sustained note played by the first cello.Rudel, Anthony J. (1995). \\"William Tell Overture\\" in Classical Music Top 40. Simon and Schuster, pp. 271‚Äì276. . Its duration is about three minutes. Storm This dynamic section in E minor is played by the full orchestra. It begins with the violins and violas. Their phrases are punctuated by short wind instrument interventions of three notes each, first by the piccolo, flute and oboes, then by the clarinets and bassoons. The storm breaks out in full with the entrance of the French horns, trumpets, trombones, and bass drum. The volume and number of instruments gradually decreases as the storm subsides. The section ends with the flute playing alone. It also lasts for about three minutes. '''''''''' This pastorale section in G major signifying the calm after the storm begins with a Ranz des vaches or \\"Call to the Cows\\", featuring the cor anglais (English horn). The English horn then plays in alternating phrases with the flute, culminating in a duet with the triangle accompanying them in the background. The melody appears several times in the opera, including the final act, and takes on the character of a leitmotif.Sadie, Stanley and Macy, Laura eds. (2006). The Grove Book of Operas, p. 271. Oxford University Press. Its duration is a little more than two minutes. This segment is often used in animated cartoons to signify daybreak, most notably in Walt Disney's The Old Mill.Stories Behind the Greatest Classical Compositions Finale: March of the Swiss Soldiers The finale, often called the \\"March of the Swiss Soldiers\\" in English, is in E major like the prelude, but it is an ultra-dynamic galop heralded by trumpets and played by the full orchestra. It alludes to the final act, which recounts the Swiss soldiers' victorious battle to liberate their homeland from Austrian repression. The segment lasts for about three minutes. Although there are no horses or cavalry charges in the opera, this segment is often used in popular media to denote galloping horses, a race, or a hero riding to the rescue. Its most famous use in that respect is as the theme music for The Lone Ranger; that usage has become so famous that the term \\"intellectual\\" has been defined as \\"a man who can listen to the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger.\\"The quote has been attributed to Jack Guin writing in The Denver Post in 1962.

Amongst the films which feature the overture prominently is Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, where an electronic rearrangement by Wendy Carlos of the finale is played during a fast motion orgy scene. The less frequently heard introductory portion of the overture is used as somber mood music later in the film.Rasmussen, Randy (2005). Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed, p. 157.

Biography Born of poor parents at Longnor, a Shropshire village 8 miles from Shrewsbury, Samuel Lee received a charity school education and at age twelve became a carpenter's apprentice in Shrewsbury. He was fond of reading and acquired knowledge of a number of languages. An early marriage caused him to reduce the time devoted to his studies, but the accidental loss of his tools caused him to become a school teacher, giving private lessons in Persian and Hindustani. His remarkable linguistic abilities eventually brought him to the notice of the Church Missionary Society, which paid for his education at Cambridge University. He entered Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1813. He graduated B.A. in 1818, and proceeded M.A. in 1819, B.D. in 1827, and D.D. in 1833. Building on the work of the Church Missionary Society missionary Thomas KendallFrom 1814, missionaries tried to define the sounds of the language. Thomas Kendall published a book in 1815 entitled A korao no New Zealand, which in modern orthography and usage would be He K≈çrero n≈ç Aotearoa. Professor Samuel Lee, working with chief Hongi Hika[40] and Hongi's junior relative Waikato at Cambridge University, established a definitive orthography based on Northern usage in 1820. Professor Lee's orthography continues in use and New Zealand chiefs Hongi Hika and Tƒ´tore he helped create the first dictionary of te Reo, the MƒÅori language. In 1819, he became professor of Arabic at Cambridge. At 15 November 1819 foundational meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the Society committee elected William Farish as president with Sedgwick and Lee as secretaries. In 1823 he became chaplain of Cambridge gaol, in 1825 rector of Bilton-with-Harrogate, Yorkshire, and in 1831 Regius Professor of Hebrew, a position he held until 1848. In 1831 he also became vicar of Banwell, Somerset and remained vicar there until he resigned in June 1838 to become rector of Barley, Hertfordshire, where he died on 16 December 1852, aged sixty-nine. In 1823 he published a version of the Peshitta which was often reprinted and was the most accessible text for a long time. He claimed to draw upon earlier manuscripts, but Lee did not specify his sources, nor how he had used them, and his text offers very few corrections to that of the Peshitta editions of the Paris and London Polyglots.

Its route mainly followed that of several former Louisville & Nashville Railroad (L&N;) passenger trains, including the Humming Bird (Cincinnati--Louisville--New Orleans). Originating in Chicago, the train served Lafayette and Bloomington, Indiana; Louisville and Bowling Green, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Decatur, Birmingham, Montgomery and Dothan, Alabama; and Thomasville, Valdosta and Waycross, Georgia. The Floridian was notorious for lackluster on-time performance, owing to poor track conditions and the poor condition of the equipment it inherited from railroads previously operating on the route. The train used the lines of L&N; (in Indiana, over the former Monon Railroad, which merged into the L&N; shortly before the formation of Amtrak), and Seaboard Coast Line. All are now part of CSX Transportation; some parts of the former route have since been abandoned by CSX. Amtrak discontinued the Floridian in October 1979, leaving Louisville and Nashville without passenger train service, two of the largest such cities in the nation to have this distinction. (Louisville briefly regained Amtrak service with the Kentucky Cardinal, which operated 1999‚Äì2003.)  History  = Pre-Amtrak = The Floridian as conceived by Amtrak was a successor of the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) South Wind, which operated over PRR track from Chicago to Louisville via Logansport and Indianapolis, Indiana; then L&N; from Louisville to Montgomery, Alabama; the Atlantic Coast Line (ACL) from Montgomery via Waycross to Jacksonville; and then either the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) to Miami or the Atlantic Coast Line to St. Petersburg. = Amtrak = Amtrak retained the South Wind as a through daily Chicago-Miami train. However, the train was rerouted away from Logansport to the James Whitcomb Riley route via Indianapolis, changing its northern terminus to Chicago's Central Station (owned by Illinois Central Railroad [IC]), which it shared with Amtrak's Panama Limited (the renamed City of New Orleans and not the original all- Pullman flagship) until that facility was vacated later in favor of consolidating all Amtrak services at Chicago's Union Station. The Floridian began using Union Station on January 23, 1972. The southbound St. Petersburg section of the Floridian at Clearwater in 1979 Amtrak also began serving the west coast of Florida by splitting the now-daily South Wind into St. Petersburg and Miami sections. The train split at Auburndale, with one section continuing to Miami and another going to St. Petersburg via Tampa. On November 14, the South Wind was reconfigured as the Floridian. The St. Petersburg and Miami sections were retained. but the split now occurred in Jacksonville, with the St. Petersburg section serving Orlando and Tampa and the Miami section serving Winter Haven. These two legs crossed each other near Lakeland, Florida. The reconfigured train also added a stop in Nashville, which had long been served by the South Wind but had initially been left out of Amtrak for much of the spring and summer. On paper, the new Floridian should have been a success. It ran through several major Midwestern and Southern cities (Chicago, Louisville, Nashville, Birmingham) en route to Florida, and its predecessor had existed for over three decades. However, it was fraught with problems. It had to contend with deteriorating Penn Central (PC)/ex-New York Central (NYC) track in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, which resulted in occasional use of MoPac (former Chicago & Eastern Illinois) and L&N; (former Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville: Monon) routes north of Louisville. In January 1977, the Floridian was cancelled for two weeks due to severe winter weather in Chicago. Two other long-distance Penn Central trains retained by Amtrak, the National Limited (successor to another PRR mainstay, the Spirit of St. Louis) and the James Whitcomb Riley, were plagued by similar problems. During Amtrak's tenure, it continued to utilize E-units from many railroads before replacing them with the SDP40Fs which began arriving in the mid 1970s. Unfortunately, these engines had a tendency to derail, especially on rickety PC trackage. The train suffered terrible delays and frequent derailments, including one at 10 mph. The consists remained steam-heated. The Floridian was briefly combined with the Louisville--Sanford run of Auto-Train. The success with the original Lorton--Sanford Auto-Train did not replicate itself on the Louisville-Sanford run, in part due to the severe delays on the Floridian, and this train was discontinued before Auto-Train itself finally succumbed to financial difficulties in the early 1980s. As part of this move Amtrak stopped serving Union Station in Louisville on November 1, 1976, instead using Auto- Train's station near Louisville International Airport. This continued until the Floridian's discontinuance. In 1979, the United States Department of Transportation compiled a report that recommended the reduction of services on several routes that did not meet a metric for cost coverage. Per this report, the Carter administration required all Amtrak routes to meet a minimum cost/farebox ratio or face discontinuance. Unfortunately, the aforementioned track issues and delays resulted in a steep decline in ridership for the Floridian. It made its last run on October 9, 1979 and was shuttered along with the National Limited, North Coast Hiawatha, Lone Star, and Champion, thus rolling back some of the key parts of the Amtrak system and also alleviating some of the losses it had incurred since its May 1, 1971 founding. This DOT report also recommended the discontinuance of the Chicago--Oakland (San Francisco) San Francisco Zephyr‚Äîwhich, as the California Zephyr, has become one of Amtrak's most popular trains. = Proposed revival = There has been no concrete effort to re-establish direct Chicago-Miami service, either on the route of the South Wind/Floridian or on that of its partners the City of Miami and Dixie Flagler. During the early 2000s, Amtrak extended the Kentucky Cardinal to a re-opened Louisville Union Station, then discontinued the train again. While there have been no proposals to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents. However, in 2007 Tennessee state officials said resumption of service was unlikely. Besides a lack of federal funding, they claimed that Nashville, despite its large size, was not large enough to support intercity rail. \\"It would be wonderful to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service,\\" said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state.  Motive power  In the diesel era, the South Wind was originally powered by PRR engines. Later, when a second train set was added, the train was typically headed by the E-units of the PRR on one set, and ACL on the other set. Though the train used the L&N; for a significant portion of its run, a run-through agreement between the PRR and ACL provided that L&N; units were only used in emergencies. Soon after the Central of Georgia (CofG) took delivery of E8s 811 and 812, they were sent to Chicago and repainted in IC colors, returning to the CofG only on diesel run-throughs of IC power. They were used on the IC system. As a result, the IC supplied power to the City of Miami from Chicago to Miami and in the mid-1960s on the Seminole between Chicago and Columbus, Georgia. These engines were returned to the CofG after Amtrak came into being, but were retired from service. The Dixie Flagler was originally steam powered with each railroad supplying their own power. Some had specifically designated streamlined engines.

It is one of the most common mammals in Europe, with a range extending from the Atlantic coast to Lake Baikal. These voles are found in moist grassy habitats, such as woodland, marsh or on river banks. Although they make shallow burrows, they usually build nests above ground. They are an important food source for owls and some other predators and their population size tends to peak and trough cyclically. Field voles breed prolifically, mainly in summer, but often all year round, even under snow. Females produce up to seven litters a year, each averaging from four to six young which are weaned after about fourteen days. The field vole is both widespread and common and is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN. Description The field vole is a small, dark brown rodent with a short tail, distinguishable from the closely related common vole (Microtus arvalis) by its darker, longer and shaggier hair and by its more densely haired ears. The head and body length varies between and the tail between . The weight is . The voice is a faint, low squeak and it also emits a range of chattering sounds. Distribution and habitat The field vole has a palearctic distribution. Its range extends throughout Western Europe and eastwards to Lake Baikal in Siberia and north west China and northward to Norway, Sweden and Finland. It is absent from Iceland and Ireland and thins out southwards towards the Mediterranean Sea. It is found in a range of habitats including meadows, field borders, plantations, woodland verges, clearings, upland heaths, dunes, marshes, bogs and river banks and tends to prefer wet areas. It is found at altitudes of up to about . Behaviour Young field vole The field vole is more active by day than the common vole. It excavates shallow burrows close to the surface of the ground, under leaf litter and under snow in winter. It also makes surface runs through tall vegetation, routes along which it can scurry back to safety if danger threatens. Off these are dedicated defecation sites and it often leaves little piles of chopped up grass stalks nearby. The field vole is a herbivore and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss and other vegetation and gnaws bark during the winter (it does not hibernate). It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. Among the plants it favours are the grasses Agrostis spp. and Festuca rubra, the yarrow (Achillea millefolium), clover (Trifolium spp.), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and buttercups (Ranunculus spp.). The voles choose species with high digestibility where possible and avoid some common plants amongst which they live such as the tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and rosebay willowherb (Chamerion angustifolium). The animals have low energy reserves and these are only able to sustain them for five to fourteen hours. Because of the low availability of food in the winter, drier habitats are unable to sustain populations of much over two hundred animals per hectare. The number of voles expands rapidly with the arrival of spring and the better availability of food supplies. Field voles are an important part of the diet of barn owls and they are also preyed on by kestrels, other owls, weasels, stoats, foxes and snakes. Though very numerous, they have little impact on man except in plague years when they may cause significant damage to crops. Breeding Field voles are induced ovulators.Milligan, S. R. \\"Mating, ovulation and corpus luteum function in the vole, Microtus agrestis.\\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 42.1 (1975): 35-44. The field vole breeds throughout the year but the breeding season peaks in spring and summer. The nest is made on or just under the surface of the ground, often in a clump of grass or sedge. The gestation period is about three weeks and up to a dozen young are borne. These grow rapidly, suckle for twelve days and leave the nest at twenty one days, reaching sexual maturity soon afterwards. Like the common vole, the field vole is subject to population explosions when conditions are right. Females become pregnant again soon after parturition. The pregnancy rate is nearly 100% in late spring but falls during midsummer only to rise again later. Mortality in the nest is about 20% but may rise to 50% in the middle of summer when the digestibility of the food supplies fall. Life expectancy is about two years but is lower for spring-born individuals than for ones born later in the year. Male field voles maintain a territory but females just have a home range which may overlap with that of a neighbour. After leaving the nest, young female voles remain in or near their mother's home range but young males are forced to disperse by the aggressiveness of the adult males. Female field voles sometimes spontaneously move in the time gap between weaning one litter and producing the next, a phenomenon typical of this species. One of the causes of the large population swings that occur in the field vole is the scramble competition which comes into play when the most desirable food plants are less available in mid summer. At this time litter sizes may fall, growth rates slow down, there may be increased mortality of young in the nest, adults may lose weight and some may die. Similar competition can occur in winter when the availability of greenstuff fails and starvation ensues. Status The field vole is common over most of its very wide range, although thinning out towards the peripheries and may be locally scarce where conditions are less suitable. The population seems stable over the long term though there are marked fluctuations from year to year. The IUCN in its Red List of Threatened Species has therefore listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

The firm is headquartered in Azusa, California, with offices and manufacturing facilities in Tucson, Arizona; Steele, Alabama; Mexico; France; and China. Rain Bird sells its products and services in over 130 countries. History Rain Bird had its origins in early 1933 when Glendora, California, citrus grower Orton Englehart developed the first prototype of the horizontal action impact sprinkler. The new design offered slow rotation and more efficient watering than other sprinklers of that era, features that were long sought after by local irrigators. Orton's friend and neighbor Clement LaFetra began helping him build and market the sprinklers, and they urged him to patent the invention. was awarded on April 16, 1935. Englehart preferred farming, so in 1935, he sold the business to Clement and Mary Elizabeth LaFetra, whose descendants still operate the company today. The name Rain Bird was taken from the Native American legend of a bird that brought rain, in reference to the bird-like appearance of the impact sprinkler in action. Since its beginnings, the firm has offered irrigation products for farms, golf courses, sports arenas, commercial developments, and residential landscapes. Rain Bird has obtained over 450 patents since its founding. Recognition The Rain Bird horizontal action impact-drive sprinkler head was recognized as a historic landmark of agricultural engineering in 1990 by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

A rodent, it lives in woodland areas and is around in length. The bank vole is found in much of Europe and in northwestern Asia. It is native to Great Britain but not to Ireland, where it has been accidentally introduced, and has now colonised much of the south and southwest. The bank vole lives in woodland, hedgerows and other dense vegetation such as bracken and bramble. Its underground chamber is lined with moss, feathers and vegetable fibre and contains a store of food. It can live for eighteen months to two years in the wild and over 42 months in captivity and is mostly herbivorous, eating buds, bark, seeds, nuts, leaves and fruits and occasionally insects and other small invertebrates. It readily climbs into scrub and low branches of trees although it is not as versatile as a mouse. It breeds in shallow burrows, the female rearing about four litters of pups during the summer. Description The bank vole is a small rodent resembling a mouse when young but developing a stouter body, a slightly rounder head with smaller ears and eyes and a shorter, hairy tail. The dorsal surface is reddish-brown, with a greyish undercoat and the flanks are grey with a reddish-brown sheen. The underparts are whitish-grey sometimes tinged with dull yellow. The ears are larger than those of most voles. The adult head and body length varies between and the tail ranges from . The weight is between . Young animals are darker in colour with greyer underparts. The bank vole is capable of making growling sounds and can utter low-pitched squeaks. In a case of distress and isolation it has been witnessed to emit a sound resembling that of a human sob. In areas such as Great Britain, where the only other small vole is the short-tailed vole (Microtus agrestis), the bank vole is distinguished by its more prominent ears, chestnut-brown fur and longer tail which is usually 50% body length. The northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus) from northern Scandinavia and Russia, has a shorter tail and is paler with less grey in its pelage. The grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus) from northern Eurasia, is larger with a distinctive reddish back. Distribution The bank vole has a Palearctic distribution. It is native to Europe, Asia Minor and parts of Western Siberia. It does not occur in Iceland or northern Scandinavia (except for Finland) and is absent from most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of Italy and the Balkans. It was introduced into southwestern Ireland in the 1950s, and there are fears that it may be displacing the native wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). A subspecies found on the island of Skomer in West Wales, the Skomer vole (Myodes glareolus skomerensis), is much larger than the mainland bank vole, and there may be 20,000 individuals on the island in late summer. Habitat The bank vole is found in forests, especially in deciduous and mixed woodland with scrub, low plants and leaf litter. It is also present in hedgerows, field verges, among bracken and brambles, river banks, swamps and parks. In mountainous regions and the northern part of its range it occurs in coniferous woodland at altitudes of up to . It is not found on bare soil and ample ground cover seems a necessity. In the Mediterranean region, at the southern extent of its range, it is a habitat specialist and is found in moist woodland but not in grassland and bushy places. At the fringes of forested areas it is possible for there to be a metapopulation consisting of a number of spatially separated populations of bank vole that come and go according to the season and local events. Some areas may be devoid of voles during the winter and be repopulated during the summer only to become empty of voles again in October. The further from permanently inhabited forest the location is, the fewer females there are and the more widely the number of individuals fluctuates. Behaviour Twigs of elder (Sambucus nigra) damaged by the bank vole The bank vole is active by day and also at night. It does not hibernate in winter. It excavates long, shallow branching burrows with multiple exits, sometimes tunnelling along beneath the leaf litter. It gathers and stores food underground and makes a nest with moss, dry grasses and leaves close to the surface or even above ground. It is in general quite bold but is also very alert to the cries of other animals such as tits (bird) warning of aerial predators. The bank vole is primarily a herbivore. Its diet varies with the season but usually consists of leaves, grasses, roots, buds, bark, fruits, nuts, grain and seeds. When feeding on grass stalks it may clip the stalks and lay the cut pieces in piles. Some food is carried back to the burrow where it is kept in dedicated storage chambers. It sometimes eats animal food in the form of insects, spiders and worms and may take eggs from the nests of birds nesting on the ground. The bank vole climbs well and in the winter it feeds on the bark of trees including beeches, maples and larch up to several metres above the ground. It also eats tree seedlings and reduces the natural regeneration of woodland and when present in large numbers, is considered a forest pest. However, its harmfulness is relatively low in a healthy ecosystem because significant damage only occurs when numbers build up, and because it has a large number of natural enemies its population is normally kept under control. Females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males. Breeding Young bank voles in their nest beneath a wood pile Females maintain territories which may overlap somewhat, and males occupy larger territories covering those of several females. The home range of females is usually between . The breeding season lasts from late April to September. Females appear to prefer dominant males and may actively avoid other vagrant males. The gestation period averages 21 days, being longer if the female is still lactating from a previous litter. A litter can be up to ten pups but the average number is four to eight. Females sometimes kill pups in burrows in adjoining territories and males sometimes kill pups before mating with their mother, perhaps as a tactic to ensure his offspring are advantaged. The pups are naked and helpless and their eyes open at about nine days. They are weaned at 20 to 25 days and the females become sexually mature by six weeks with the males reaching maturity by eight weeks. There may be up to four litters per year and as the youngsters start to breed, numbers quickly build up over the summer months. The bank vole lives for up to two years in the wild. In captivity this can increase to over 42 months, with the older voles tending to spend most time resting, less physically agile, though still capable of having a spin on the wheel. Ecology Bank vole carrying nest material The bank vole is plentiful during much of the year and plays an important part in the diet of various predators including the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the stoat (Mustela erminea), the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), the European mink (Mustela lutreola), the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and the tawny owl (Strix aluco). The voles try to prevent being caught by avoiding open areas of ground, by using tunnels and well-worn paths through the undergrowth. The bank vole acts as a reservoir of infection for the Puumala virus, which can infect humans, causing a haemorrhagic fever known as nephropathia epidemica and, in extreme cases, even death.Yeron Kalner (August 7, 2014) \\"Deadly Research,\\" Retrieved Yedioth Ahronoth, p. 27, announced the death of Dr. Keren Ambar, a post-graduate studying the behavior of the bank vole in Finland. She had been affected by the Puumala virus which caused a complete breakdown of her immune system. Although this hantavirus has co- evolved with its host, its presence among populations seems to decrease their over-winter survival rates. Status The bank vole has a very wide range across Europe and western Asia. The population density depends on the time of year and location and varies between six and one hundred individuals per hectare. The population size varies from year to year but in the long term appears to be stable. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bank vole as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in its Red List of Threatened Species. When it lives on road verges, the bank vole can suffer from lead toxicity and near farmland it may be affected by pesticides, molluscicides and rodenticides.

Indian wars Heavily influenced by his military uncles, he followed in their footsteps and left Monroe in May 1876, with his sister Emma, for Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakota Territory. There, he was hired on May 10 to serve as a beef herder for the 7th Cavalry Regiment, which was under the command of George Armstrong Custer. Reed is buried with other family members at the Woodland Cemetery in Monroe, Michigan. His headstone is on the far right with the flower. Reed joined the 7th Cavalry Regiment shortly after the start of the Great Sioux War of 1876‚Äì77 in the Montana Territory, part of the larger American Indian Wars. While Reed was never officially enlisted as a soldier, he volunteered his services as such for the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. Under normal circumstances, this would have been prohibited, but since he was part of the \\"Custer Clan\\" with his three uncles, he was granted permission by them to partake in the battle. The regiment's orderly, John Burkman, argued for Reed to stay back with the herding train where he belonged. Burkman himself was ordered to stay behind, and Reed taunted him by saying, \\"You're mad because you can't go along\\", before riding off on his horse for combat. Death The Battle of the Little Bighorn proved a disastrous defeat for the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Reed was killed, as were all three of his uncles who fought in that battle‚Äî George, Boston, and Thomas‚Äî and Reed's uncle-in-law James Calhoun. Reed was killed atop Last Stand Hill; his head was scalped and body was mutilated by the victorious Indian forces, as were the majority of those killed in the battle. A marble marker was erected at the exact site where his body was recovered several days later. He was originally buried on the battlefield, but a year later, his body was exhumed and interred at the Woodland Cemetery in his hometown of Monroe, Michigan, while the marble marker remains in its location in the present-day Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. His removed scalp was previously on display at the Museum of World Treasures in Wichita, Kansas.

Microsoft has three technologies for clustering: Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS, a HA clustering service), Component Load Balancing (CLB) (part of Application Center 2000), and Network Load Balancing Services (NLB). With the release of Windows Server 2008 the MSCS service was renamed to Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), and the Component Load Balancing (CLB) feature became deprecated. Prior to Windows Server 2008, clustering required (per Microsoft KBs) that all nodes in the clusters to be as identical as possible from hardware, drivers, firmware, all the way to software. After Windows Server 2008 however, Microsoft modified the requirements to state that only the operating system needs to be of the same level (such as patch level). Background Cluster Server was codenamed \\"Wolfpack\\" during its development. Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition was the first version of Windows to include the MSCS software. The software has since been updated with each new server release. The cluster software evaluates the resources of servers in the cluster and chooses which are used based on criteria set in the administration module. In June 2006, Microsoft released Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003, the first high-performance computing (HPC) cluster technology offering from Microsoft.  History  During Microsoft's first attempt at development of a cluster server Microsoft originally priced at $10,000, ran into problems causing the software to fail because of buggy software causing fail-over forcing the workload from two servers to a single server. This results in poor allocation of resources, poor performance of the servers, and very poor reviews from analysts. The announcement of a new update to the Microsoft Cluster Server software came in 1998 promising new features in 1999 and the newest addition in the line of Windows NT software in the form of Windows NT 5.0 Enterprise Edition. Also promising support for 4 nodes post release of NT 5.0. Microsoft's first attempt at pushing the cluster server software was at the 2005 Super-Computing conference in Seattle the new software being developed, Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003 (Windows CCS 2003), is still in beta. On May 8, 2006 Microsoft reports the release of the full featured Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003 (for industrial use) and the Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003 R2 (for small businesses) software to the public for purchase in summer 2006.

The term is derived from the fact that, from the beginning of modern filmmaking toward the end of the 20th century, and in many places still up to the present, the single images have been recorded on a strip of photographic film that quickly increased in length, historically; each image on such a strip looks rather like a framed picture when examined individually. The term may also be used more generally as a noun or verb to refer to the edges of the image as seen in a camera viewfinder or projected on a screen. Thus, the camera operator can be said to keep a car in frame by panning with it as it speeds past. Overview When the moving picture is displayed, each frame is flashed on a screen for a short time (nowadays, usually 1/24, 1/25 or 1/30 of a second) and then immediately replaced by the next one. Persistence of vision blends the frames together, producing the illusion of a moving image. The frame is also sometimes used as a unit of time, so that a momentary event might be said to last six frames, the actual duration of which depends on the frame rate of the system, which varies according to the video or film standard in use. In North America and Japan, 30 frames per second (fps) is the broadcast standard, with 24 frames/s now common in production for high-definition video shot to look like film. In much of the rest of the world, 25 frames/s is standard. In systems historically based on NTSC standards, for reasons originally related to the Chromilog NTSC TV systems, the exact frame rate is actually (3579545 / 227.5) / 525 = 29.97002616 fps. This leads to many synchronization problems which are unknown outside the NTSC world, and also brings about hacks such as drop-frame timecode. In film projection, 24 fps is the normal, except in some special venue systems, such as IMAX, Showscan and Iwerks 70, where 30, 48 or even 60 frame/s have been used. Silent films and 8 mm amateur movies used 16 or 18 frame/s.  Physical film frames  In a strip of movie film, individual frames are separated by frame lines. Normally, 24 frames are needed for one second of film. In ordinary filming, the frames are photographed automatically, one after the other, in a movie camera. In special effects or animation filming, the frames are often shot one at a time. The size of a film frame varies, depending on the still film format or the motion picture film format. In the smallest 8 mm amateur format for motion pictures film, it is only about 4.8 by 3.5 mm, while an IMAX frame is as large as 69.6 by 48.5 mm. The larger the frame size is in relation to the size of the projection screen, the sharper the image will appear. The size of the film frame of motion picture film also depends on the location of the holes, the size of the holes, the shape of the holes. and the location and type of sound stripe. The most common film format, 35 mm, has a frame size of 36 by 24 mm when used in a still 35 mm camera where the film moves horizontally, but the frame size varies when used for motion picture where the film moves vertically (with the exception of VistaVision and Technirama where the film moves horizontally). Using a 4-perf pulldown, there are exactly 16 frames in one foot of 35 mm film, leading to film frames sometimes being counted in terms of \\"feet and frames\\". The maximum frame size is 18 by 24 mm, (silent/full aperture), but this is significantly reduced by the application of sound track(s). A system called KeyKode is often used to identify specific physical film frames in a production.  Video frames  Historically, video frames were represented as analog waveforms in which varying voltages represented the intensity of light in an analog raster scan across the screen. Analog blanking intervals separated video frames in the same way that frame lines did in film. For historical reasons, most systems used an interlaced scan system in which the frame typically consisted of two video fields sampled over two slightly different periods of time. This meant that a single video frame was usually not a good still picture of the scene, unless the scene being shot was completely still. With the dominance of digital technology, modern video systems now represent the video frame as a rectangular raster of pixels, either in an RGB color space or a color space such as YCbCr, and the analog waveform is typically found nowhere other than in legacy I/O devices. Standards for the digital video frame raster include Rec. 601 for standard- definition television and Rec. 709 for high-definition television. Video frames are typically identified using SMPTE time code. =Line and resolution= The frame is composed of picture elements just like a chess board. Each horizontal set of picture elements is known as a line. The picture elements in a line are transmitted as sine signals where a pair of dots, one dark and one light can be represented by a single sine. The product of the number of lines and the number of maximum sine signals per line is known as the total resolution of the frame. The higher the resolution the more faithful the displayed image is to the original image. But higher resolution introduces technical problems and extra cost. So a compromise should be reached in system designs both for satisfactory image quality and affordable price. =Viewing distance= The key parameter to determine the lowest resolution still satisfactory to viewers is the viewing distance, i.e. the distance between the eyes and the monitor. The total resolution is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. If d is the distance, r is the required minimum resolution and k is the proportionality constant which depends on the size of the monitor; : r = k^2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{d^2} Since the number of lines is approximately proportional to the resolution per line, the above relation can also be written as : n = k \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{d} where n is the number of lines. That means that the required resolution is proportional to the height of the monitor and inversely proportional to the viewing distance. =Moving picture= In moving picture (TV) the number of frames scanned per second is known as the frame rate. The higher the frame rate, the better the sense of motion. But again, increasing the frame rate introduces technical difficulties. So the frame rate is fixed at 25 (System B/G) or 29.97 (System M). To increase the sense of motion it is customary to scan the very same frame in two consecutive phases. In each phase only half of the lines are scanned; only the lines with odd numbers in the first phase and only the lines with even numbers in the second phase. Each scan is known as a field. So the field rate is two times the frame rate. =Example (System B)= In system B the number of lines is 625 and the frame rate is 25. The maximum video bandwidth is 5 MHz.Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30 The maximum number of sine signals the system is theorically capable of transmitting is given as follows: The system is able to transmit 5 000 000 sine signals in a second. Since the frame rate is 25, the maximum number of sine signals per frame is 200 000. Dividing this number by the number of lines gives the maximum number of sine signals in a line which is 320. (Actually about 19% of each line is devoted to auxiliary services. So the number of maximum useful sine signals is about 260.) Still frame A still frame is a single static image taken from a film or video, which are kinetic (moving) images. Still frames are also called freeze frame, video prompt, preview or misleadingly thumbnail, keyframe, poster frame,Microsoft: Add a poster frame to your video, retrieved 29 June 2014Indezine: Poster Frames for Videos in PowerPoint 2010 for Windows, retrieved 29 June 2014 or screen shot/grab/capture/dump.

This latter one is used often in films as well. This hearkens back to some early cartoons, where characters were aware that they were in a cartoon, specifically that they could look at the credits and be aware of something that isn't part of the story as presented. These jokes include: * Split frames ‚Äì Where the fourth wall is broken by two frames, the lower half of the previous frame and the upper part of the next frame, showing at once, usually showing frame lines, with jokes involving them including a character crossing the frame itself. * Film break ‚Äì A famous form of the joke, where the film either snaps or is deliberately broken, with often the fourth wall coming into play during this period when, rightfully, there should be nothing on screen. * Gate hair ‚Äì A famous form of joke where the animator intentionally places fake \\"gate hairs\\" within the frame, which one of the animated characters plucks and removes from the frame. * Editorial marks ‚Äì Where those marks which an editor would normally employ on a \\"work print\\" to indicate the intended presence of a fade or a dissolve or a \\"wipe\\" to the SFX department are animated, and the film follows suit, or doesn't, depending upon the intended effect. * Cue marks ‚Äì Where those marks, usually circular for non-Technicolor titles and \\"serrated\\" for Technicolor titles to indicate a reel changeover are animated for a humorous effect. This could also be employed for the famous \\"false ending\\" effect, employed even today in popular songs. For Inglourious Basterds, the cue marks for the reel changes of the Nation's Pride pseudo- documentary employed exceptionally large scribed circles with a large \\"X\\" scribed within it‚Äîmarks which would never be utilized in actual editorial practice (motor and changeover cue marks are supposed to be clearly visible to the projectionist, but not obvious to the audience). * Exiting the frame ‚Äì This joke, an extension of the split frames joke, has characters depart from the sides of the frame, sometimes finding themselves falling out of the cartoon entirely.

Kriza, odgovori, levica: Prilozi za jedan kritiƒçki diskurs, Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung Southeastern Europe: Belgrade, p. 239 (in Serbian) Widely known for her critique of identity politics and her philosophical work on the concept of justice, Fraser is also a staunch critic of contemporary liberal feminism and its abandonment of social justice issues. Fraser holds honorary doctoral degrees from four universities in three countries, and won the 2010 Alfred Schutz Prize in Social Philosophy from the American Philosophical Association. She is President of the American Philosophical Association Eastern Division. Career Fraser earned her bachelor's degree in philosophy at Bryn Mawr in 1969 and received her PhD in philosophy from the CUNY Graduate Center in 1980. She taught in the philosophy department at Northwestern University for many years before moving to the New School, and has been a visiting professor at universities in Germany, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. In addition to her many publications and lectures, Fraser is a former co-editor of Constellations, an international journal of critical and democratic theory, where she remains an active member of the Editorial Council. She has been invited to deliver the Tanner Lectures at Stanford University and the Spinoza Lectures at the University of Amsterdam. Research Fraser has written on a wide variety of issues, but she is primarily known for her work on the philosophical conceptions of justice and injustice. Fraser argues that justice can be understood in two separate but interrelated ways: distributive justice (in terms of a more equitable distribution of resources), and the justice of recognition (the equal recognition of different identities/groups within a society). There are two corresponding forms of injustice: maldistribution and misrecognition. Fraser argues that many social justice movements in the 1960s and 1970s argued for recognition on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, and that the focus on correcting misrecognition eclipsed the importance of challenging the persistent problems of maldistribution. In other words, Fraser asserts that too much of a focus on identity politics diverts attention from the deleterious effects of neoliberal capitalism and the growing wealth inequality that characterizes many societies. In more recent work, Fraser goes even further in linking the narrow focus of identity politics with the widening gap between the rich and poor, particularly with regard to liberal feminism, which Fraser calls the \\"handmaiden\\" of capitalism. Reflecting on Sheryl Sandberg's 2013 book Lean In, Fraser explained: > For me, feminism is not simply a matter of getting a smattering of > individual women into positions of power and privilege within existing > social hierarchies. It is rather about overcoming those hierarchies. This > requires challenging the structural sources of gender domination in > capitalist society ‚Äî above all, the institutionalized separation of two > supposedly distinct kinds of activity: on the one hand, so-called > \\"productive\\" labor, historically associated with men and remunerated by > wages; on the other hand, \\"caring\\" activities, often historically unpaid and > still performed mainly by women. In my view, this gendered, hierarchical > division between \\"production\\" and \\"reproduction\\" is a defining structure of > capitalist society and a deep source of the gender asymmetries hard-wired in > it. There can be no \\"emancipation of women\\" so long as this structure > remains intact. Books =Fortunes of Feminism= Fortunes of Feminism: From State-Managed Capitalism to Neoliberal Crisis is a collection of essays written from 1985 to 2010Fraser, Nancy (2013). Fortunes of feminism: from state-managed capitalism to neoliberal crisis. Brooklyn, New York: Verso Books. that aims at dissecting the \\"drama in three acts\\" that according to the author is the thread of second-wave feminism. Act one represents the moment when the feminist movement joined radical movements to transform society through uncovering gender injustice and capitalism's androcentrism, while act two, Fraser highlights with regret, is a switch from redistribution to recognition and difference and a shift to identity politics that risk to support neoliberalism through efforts to build a free-market society. Foreseeing act three as a revival of the movement, Fraser argues for a reinvigorated feminist radicalism able to address the global economic crisis.\\"Fortunes of Feminism.\\" Verso. Verso Books, n.d. Web. March 23, 2015. Feminism must be a force working in concert with other egalitarian movements in the struggle to bring the economy under democratic control, while building on the visionary potential of the earlier waves of women's liberation. The work is considered an important contribution as it provides a clear frame to rethink issues related to labor, emancipation, identity, rights claims at the core of political demands of justice in the contemporary context of neoliberalism. Although a necessary incorporation of political economy into contemporary feminist discourse, Fraser's use of theoretical schemas has been criticized as dense and baffling at times‚Äîit is unclear, for example, why there are three types of needs discourses, four registers of dependency, or seven principles of gender justice. M. E. Mitchell, writer for Marx & Philosophy, writes \\"This [complexity] is, perhaps, owing to her propensity to avail herself of whatever terms best encapsulate processes of institutionalized oppression. Thinking thus, from the ground up, gives her work a complexity that at times compromises the systematic quality and coherence of her theoretical categories.\\" =Unruly Practices= Unruly Practices: Power, Discourse, and Gender in Contemporary Social Theory is a collection of essays written between 1980 and 1989.Fraser, Nancy. Unruly Practices: Power, Discourse, and Gender in Contemporary Social Theory. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 1989. Print. The book examines the theories of power and source in Foucault, the politics of French deconstruction and Richard Rorty, the politics of gender in Habermas, and the politics of need interpretation in two concluding essays which delineate her own position within contemporary socialist-feminist critical theory. Contemporaries such as Douglas Kellner have praised Fraser's writings as \\"seasoned with social hope\\" and effectively synthesizing feminist commitment to political agency and social progress with several forms of modern and postmodern social skepticism. However, others have criticized her goal of providing \\"the sort of big diagnostic picture necessary to orient [the current] political practice\\" of socialist feminism for being both too ambitious and ultimately too narrow. Patricia S. Mann, for example, summarizes the pitfalls of the text as follows: > I wish Fraser had made more of an effort to call upon the resources of > analytic philosophy. It is true that analytic philosophers look all the way > back to Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham for their paradigms of analytic > philosophy. Unfazed because untouched by these notions of social > constitution of individuals, or by the irrationalities of individual > thought, philosophy offers an outmoded yet still seaworthy vessel for any > seeking to ride out the storms of postmodern disillusionment with notions of > agency and process. Had Fraser utilized the works of analytic political > thinkers when she finally came to formulate her socialist-feminist theory of > the welfare state she could have exploited the admittedly \\"thin\\" theories of > political agency and political rights within political philosophy today.

Only one specimen has been formally described. This specimen (the holotype) consists of a virtually complete articulated skull and skeleton, it shared its corporal characteristics with most other Mesozoic mammals; it was a long-tailed, nocturnal tetrapod (with prehensile fingers and toes) which hunted insects, its food, during the night. Possible specimen displayed in Hong Kong Science Museum Restoration It is suspected to be a nocturnal creature because it had very large eyes which were roughly 5 cm across. This would have allowed it to have better night vision for catching insects. It is notable for its relatively derived forelimb morphology, having shoulder blades and other pectoral girdle elements comparable to those of modern therians like opossums. It also had grasping hands. By contrast, however, the hindlimbs retained primitive characters, suggesting a sprawling stance. Recent studies show that it was specialised to an arboreal lifestyle, possessing prehensile hands.Meng Chen, Gregory Philip Wilson, A multivariate approach to infer locomotor modes in Mesozoic mammals, Article in Paleobiology 41(02) ¬∑ February 2015 References Category:Triconodonts Category:Cretaceous mammals Category:Mesozoic mammals of Asia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1999 Category:Yixian fauna Category:Taxa named by Qiang Ji (paleontologist) Category:Taxa named by Zhe-Xi Luo Category:Taxa named by Shu- An Ji ","title":"Jeholodens"},{"id":"2356161","text":"Tom√°≈° Dvo≈ô√°k (), born 11 May 1972 in Gottwaldov (now Zl√≠n), Czechoslovakia, is an athlete from the Czech Republic.

He was the adjutant for George Armstrong Custer and was killed during the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Overview Cooke was born in Mount Pleasant, Brant County, Ontario, to Alexander and Angeline Cooke. He attended the Brantford Collegiate School and the Central School in Hamilton, Ontario. At the age of 14, he moved to Buffalo, New York to continue his studies. After graduating from school, he enlisted in 1863 with the 24th New York Cavalry at Niagara Falls, New York, during the Civil War. After serving as a recruiting officer, he served on the front lines in the IX Corps, commanded by Ambrose Burnside. He was wounded during the Siege of Petersburg. After being released from the hospital, he served on commissary duty. He rose to first lieutenant on December 14, 1864, but did not return to front-line duty until March 1865. He was awarded brevet promotions to captain, major, and lieutenant colonel for his meritorious service during the war, the last of his actions occurred at the Battle of Sayler's Creek during the Appomattox Campaign. After the war, he immediately joined the 1st New York Provisional Cavalry and applied for a Regular Army commission. He was made a second lieutenant in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment in July 1866, and was promoted to first lieutenant a year later at Fort Harker in Kansas. In 1868, he participated in the Washita Campaign. In 1871, he became the regimental adjutant under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Cooke became close friends with Thomas Custer and was a member of the so-called \\"Custer Clan\\" or \\"Custer Gang\\", a close-knit group of Custer's friends and relatives. He was an excellent shot and one of the fastest runners of the regiment. Some of his troopers took a dislike to him and called him \\"The Queen's Own\\". He was known for his dundrearies, or long side whiskers, that he always wore. Little Big Horn Cooke was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. His body was found close to his commander. He was the author of the famous \\"last message\\" to Frederick Benteen, carried by Sergeant John Martin, that read: Cooke was initially interred on the battlefield. A memorial slab marks the approximate spot where he fell. In June 1877, he was reburied in the Little Bighorn National Cemetery. In August of that year, his family had the remains disinterred again and reburied in the family's plot in the Hamilton Cemetery in Hamilton, Ontario. The Grand Army of the Republic in Hamilton is named in Cooke's memory and honor. Notes References *Cooke Bio * Arnold, Steve, and French, Tim, Custer's Forgotten Friend: the Life of W.W.

Her legend states that the Roman Emperor Maximinus Daia courted her, yet she rejected his suit in fidelity to Christianity and virginity, and consequently he had her decapitated in c. 320. Historicity Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that Emperor Maximinus had an insane passion for a noble maiden who was famous for her wealth, education, and virginity.Eusebius of Caesarea, Ecclesiastical History, 8, 14. When the maiden refused his advances, he exiled her and seized all of her wealth. Eusebius did not name the maiden, yet Tyrannius Rufinus denominated her \\"Dorothea\\" and wrote that she fled to Arabia. Caesar Baronius identified the maiden in Eusebius' narrative as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, however the hagiographical Bollandists rejected this theory. In the 16th century, Dorothea was confused with Dorothea of Caesarea, a more famous saint of the same name, whose feast day is 6 February. Consequently, sometimes 6 February was celebrated also as the feast of the Alexandrian saint. She is not recorded in the Roman Martyrology of the Catholic Church.

Ramachandran Central Railway Station), formerly known as Madras Central (station code: MAS), is the main railway terminus in the City of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is the busiest railway station in South India and one of the most important hubs in the country. It is connected to Moore Market Complex railway station, Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central metro station, Chennai Park railway station, Park Town railway station and is 2 km from Chennai Egmore railway station. The terminus connects the city to northern India, including Kolkata, Mumbai and New Delhi as well as to Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and parts of Kerala. The century-old building of the railway station, designed by architect George Harding, is one of the most prominent landmarks of Chennai. The station is also a main hub for the Chennai Suburban Railway system. It lies adjacent to the current headquarters of the Southern Railway and the Ripon Building. During the British Raj, the station served as the gateway to South India, and the station is still used as a landmark for the city and the state. The station was renamed twice; first to reflect the name change of the city from Madras to Chennai in 1996 it was renamed from Madras Central to Chennai Central, and then to honor the founder of AIADMK and the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran it was renamed as Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station on 5 April 2019. About 550,000 passengers use the terminus every day, making it the busiest railway station in South India. Along with Chennai Egmore and Coimbatore Junction, the Central terminus is among the most profitable stations of Southern Railways. As per a report published in 2007 by the Indian Railways, Chennai Central and Secunderabad were awarded 183 points out of a maximum of 300 for cleanliness, the highest in the country.  History  Marking the initial days of the railways in the Indian Subcontinent, the Madras Railway Company began to network South India in 1856. The first station was built at Royapuram, which remained the main station at that time. Expansion of the Madras Railways network, particularly the completion of the Madras‚ÄìVyasarpadi line, called for a second station in Madras, resulting in Madras Central coming into being. Madras Central was built in 1873 at Parktown as a second terminus to decongest the Royapuram harbour station, which was being utilised for port movements. The station was built on the open grounds that had once been called John Pereira's Gardens, belonging to Joao Pereira de Faria (John Pereira), a Portuguese merchant in the port town of Negapatam (present day Nagapattinam) who settled in Madras in 1660. The garden had a house used by Pereira for rest and recreation. Having fallen into disuse, the garden had become a gaming den, with cock-fighting being the favourite sport at that time, until when the Trinity Chapel was built nearby in 1831 and the Railways moved into the area in the 1870s. In 1907, Madras Central was made the Madras Railway Company's main station. The station gained prominence after the beach line was extended further south in the same year, and Royapuram was no longer a terminus for Madras. All trains were then terminated at Madras Central instead. The Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company was formed in 1908 and took over the Central station from the Madras Railway Company. The station's position was further strengthened after the construction of the headquarters of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway (erstwhile Madras Railway and now known as the Southern Railway) adjacent to it in 1922. Madras Central was part of South Indian Railway Company during the British rule. The company was established in 1890 and was initially headquartered in Trichinopoly. Egmore Railway Station was made its northern terminus in 1908. It was then shifted to Madurai and later to Madras Central. With the opening of the Egmore Railway Station, plans were first made of linking Madras Central and Egmore, which was later dropped. The company operated a suburban electric train service for Madras city from May 1931 onwards in the Madras Beach-Tambaram section. In 1959, additional changes were made to the station. Electrification of the lines at the station began in 1979, when the section up to Gummidipoondi was electrified on 13 April 1979. The lines up to Tiruvallur were electrified on 29 November 1979 while the tracks along Platforms 1 to 7 were electrified on 29 December 1979. = Expansion = In the 1980s, the Southern Railway required land for expansion of the terminus and was looking for the erstwhile Moore Market building located next to the terminus. In 1985, when the market building caught fire and was destroyed, the structure was transferred to the Railways by the government, and the Railways built a 13-storied complex to house the suburban terminus and railway reservation counter. The land in front of the building was made into a car park. Following the renaming of the city of Madras in 1996, the station became known as Chennai Central. Due to increasing passenger movement, the main building was extended in 1998 with the addition of a new building on the western side with a similar architecture to the original. After this duplication of the main building, the station had 12 platforms. Capacity at the station was further augmented when the multi- storeyed Moore Market Complex was made a dedicated terminus with three separate platforms for the Chennai Suburban Railway system. In the 1990s, when the IRCTC was formed, modular stalls came up and food plazas were set up. In 2005, the buildings were painted a light brown colour, but concurring with the views of a campaign by the citizens of Chennai and also to retain the old nostalgic charm, they were repainted in their original brick-red color. The station is the first in India to be placed on the cyber map.  Location  The terminus lies on the southern arm of the diamond junction of Chennai's railway network, where all the lines of the Chennai Suburban Railway meet. The terminus is located about 19 km from Chennai International Airport. The main entrance is located at Park Town at the intersection of the arterial Poonamallee High Road, Pallavan Salai, and Wall Tax Road between the People's Park and the Southern Railways headquarters. The station premises is located on either side of the Buckingham Canal, formerly known as Cochrane's Canal, which separates the main station and the suburban terminus. Wall Tax Road runs alongside the station on the eastern side. There are two other entrances on the eastern and western sides of the complex. The eastern entrance on Wall Tax Road leads to platform no. 1, and the western entrance lies at the entrance of the suburban terminus. The station is connected with the Park railway station and the Government General Hospital, both located across the road, by means of subways. During the building of the Chennai Metro the connection from Chennai Park to Chennai Central is by means of a steel footbridge.  Layout  = Architecture = Built in the Gothic Revival style, the original station was designed by George Harding and consisted of four platforms and a capacity to accommodate 12-coach trains. It took another five years for the work to be completed, when the station was modified further by Robert Fellowes Chisholm with the addition of the central clock tower, Travancore 'caps' on the main towers, and other changes.Madras ‚Äì The Architectural Heritage, , p53 The redesign was eventually completed in 1900. The main building, a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles has been declared as a heritage building. The clock tower with the flagstaff, the tallest of the towers of the main building, has four faces and reaches a height of 136 ft. It is set to chime every quarter of an hour and every hour. The station has a platform area of 51,182 square metres (excluding the suburban station building) and the total building area of the main station is 14,062 square metres. = Platforms = Platform No.10 at the terminus Chennai Central is a terminal station with bay platforms. The average length of railway tracks in the station is 600 metres. The entire complex has 17 platforms to handle long-distance trains with 5 platforms exclusively for suburban trains. The total length of the station is about 950 m. The main building has 12 platforms and handles long distance trains. The complex for suburban trains is popularly known as the Moore Market complex. There is a platform 2A between platforms 2 and 3; it is used to handle short-length trains like the Chennai Rajdhani Express, Vijayawada Jan Shatabdi Express, Bengaluru Shatabdi Express, Mysuru Shatabdi Express and the Gudur Passenger. The 13-storied annex building, the Moore Market Complex Building, has 5 platforms and handles north- and westbound suburban trains. Chennai Central used to have trains with special liveries until the early 1990s. The Brindavan Express used to have green livery with a yellow stripe running above and below the windows; Nilgiri Express (popularly known as the Blue Mountain Express) had blue livery. All trains now have the standard blue livery (denoting air-braked bogies). Notable exceptions include the Rajadhani, Shatabdi and the Jan Shatabdi expresses. The Sapthagiri Express, Tirupati Express has a vivid green/cream livery combination with a matching WAM4 6PE loco from Arakkonam (AJJ) electric loco shed. Chennai Central, unlike many other major railway stations in India, is a terminus. The next station to Chennai Central, the Basin Bridge Junction, is the railway junction where three different lines meet. As of 2015, all platforms except 2A platforms, in the station were able to accommodate trains with 24 coaches. Platform 2A is the shortest of all platforms in the station and can accommodate trains with 18 coaches. Chennai Central is the only station that has a platform numbered 2A. Though it was built actually for delivering water and goods to the station staff, the Shatabdi Express now starts from here. = Bridge = The bridge across the Buckingham Canal Bridge No.7 across the Buckingham Canal connects the terminus with the railway yards and stations to the north. The bridge, measuring 33.02 m in length and carrying six tracks, acts as the gateway to the terminus. The bridge was originally resting on cast iron screw pile. Following the 2001 accident of Mangalore Chennai Mail killing 57 passengers, Southern Railway started replacing all bridges resting on screw piles, and the bridge was replaced with a new RCC box bridge resting on well foundation in September 2010, with ancillary works getting completed by March 2011.  Traffic  On an average, 19 trains are operated daily from the station of which 12 have 24 coaches. About 200 trains arrive and depart at the station daily, including about 46 pairs of mail/express trains, in addition to 257 suburban trains handled by the five platforms at the station's suburban terminus. About 400,000 passengers use the terminus every day, in addition to 20,000 visitors accompanying them to see-off or receive them, generating a revenue of as of 2012‚Äì2013, making it the top revenue-generating station of the Southern Railway. There is likely to be around passengers in the station at a given point. As of 2015‚Äì16, the main station alone (excluding the suburban station) has an average passenger footfall of 95,560 per day. Passenger earnings in the same period amounted to 8947.4 million. The station managed 491 trains a day. It has been projected that the number of passengers using the main station per day in the next 40 years will be 650,000. The terminus also faces traffic problems. Often, express trains and EMU services that arrive at the Basin Bridge Junction in time have to be detained for non- availability of platforms at Chennai Central. Blocking of lines is a daily challenge owing to the traffic.  Services  Chennai Central railway station is a major transit point for shipment of inland and sea fish in South India through trains. The terminus handles fish procured from Kasimedu which is sent to Kerala and sea fish from the West Coast which is brought to Chennai and ferried to West Bengal. As of 2012, on an average, the terminus handles transportation of 200 boxes of fish, each comprising to of consumable fish. The station also handles 5,000 postal bags daily.  Facilities  Inside the main station The station has bookshops, restaurants, accommodation facilities, Internet browsing centres, and a shopping mall. The main waiting hall can hold up to 1,000 people. In spite of being the most important terminus of the region, the station lacks several facilities such as drinking water facility, a medical unit and coach position display boards. The main concourses too have long exhausted their capacity to handle the increasing passenger crowd. There are passenger operated enquiry terminals and seven touch-screen PNR status machines in the station. The station has three split-flap timing boards, electronic display boards and Plasma TVs that mention train timings and platform number. A passenger information center in the station has been upgraded with \\"Spot your Train\\" live train display facility, information kiosks and passenger digital assistance booths. The terminus, however, has only 10 toilets, which is inadequate to its 350,000 passengers. As of 2008, there were 607 licensed railway porters in Chennai Central. Four-seater battery operated vehicles are available to cater to the needs of the elderly and the physically impaired. On 26 September 2014, Chennai Central became the first in the country to get free Wi-Fi connectivity. The facility is being provided by RailTel, a public sector telecom infrastructure provider. ;Emergency medical care In November 2012, a public interest writ petition was filed in the Madras High Court citing the lack of a full-fledged emergency medical care centre at the terminus. Further to this, the Southern Railway invited expression of interest from several hospitals in the city to establish a medical care centre. On 15 April 2013, a new emergency medical care centre was opened. The centre has three beds, two doctors on duty and another on standby, four nurses, a paramedic team, and a round-the-clock ambulance. The centre is equipped with oxygen cylinders, an ECG, a defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. The terminus is the first railway station in the country to have facilities of an ambulance. ;Parking The station has parking facilities for more than 1,000 two-wheelers. About 1,000 cars are parked in the standard car park every day. Since March 2008, a premium car park facility for 80 cars in addition to its regular car park is functioning at the station. The cement-concrete-paved premium parking is located between the Moore Market reservation complex and the station's main building. However, the station still faces parking problems. About 3,000 taxis arrives at the station every day.  Maintenance  According to the Railway sources, as of July 2012, Chennai Central was 180 short of the sanctioned 405 maintenance employees, including mechanical, electrical and general maintenance, required for cleaning the interiors and exteriors of trains and undertaking routine mechanical and electrical maintenance of trains. Contracts for cleaning the station has been awarded for a period of three years from 2010 for a value of 43.1 million. In 2007, the number of dustbins in the station was 28.50 per 10,000 passengers. On average, about 51 train units depart and arrive at the station from different parts of the country everyday. Of the 102 trains, a 12 are sent during the day and another 7 at night to the Basin Bridge Train Care Centre for primary maintenance, which involves complete exterior and interior cleaning and total mechanical and electrical overhaul. The rest of the trains go through secondary maintenance or 'other-end attention' at the depot or 'turn back train attention' at Chennai Central itself. Secondary maintenance includes filling water, while the third is the 'other-end attention', in which the train, especially the toilets, is cleaned. The fourth category of trains, such as Sapthagiri Express and Pallavan Express, are turn-back trains, which arrive and leave in a short time from Chennai Central after toilet-cleaning and water-filling is done right at the terminus platform. The station has been divided into two zones for mechanised cleaning contracts. As of 2008, Chennai Central had about 30 sanitary workers employed on a contractual basis in Zone I (platforms 1 to 6). Zone II (platforms 7 to 12) was cleaned by close to 40 railway employees. = Yards and sheds =  Train care centre  Train Care Centre station pilot WDS4B involved in shunting passenger trains A broad-gauge coach maintenance depot, called the Basin Bridge Train Care Centre, is located at the northern side of the terminus, where trains of 18 to 24 coaches are checked, cleaned and readied for its next trip after they return from round trips. It is the largest train care centre under the Southern Railway where 30 pairs of trains are inspected every day. The yard has 14 pit lines, each 3-ft deep, to inspect undercarriage of trains, but only two lines can accommodate 24-coach trains. The rest are designed to park 18-coach trains. Five to six people are allotted to each train. As of 2012, the centre has 3,500 employees, a shortage of about 400. Water accumulated in pit lines are let out into the Buckingham Canal by means of drainage channels. However, as the yard is located in a basin area, water does not drain quickly enough. In addition, the centre faces pests and other hygiene issues too.  Electric trip shed  The terminus has an electric locomotive trip shed, the Basin Bridge electric loco trip shed, located north of the train care centre. It is one of the five loco trip sheds of the Southern Railway. To lessen load on the shed, an additional electric trip shed has been created at Tondiarpet, which also serves as a crew change point for freights.  Goods shed  The terminus has a goods shed attached to it at Salt Cotaurs.  Renovation  Chennai Central gets renovation after 2010, is undertaken by the building division of the Southern Railway with the technical assistance provided by the Chennai Circle of Archaeological Survey of India. The work is carried out to ensure the original character of the building is maintained. The Station building has maroon colour since its inception in 1873. In February 2019, as part of the Railway Ministry's plan to install flag masts at 75 major stations in the country, a 100-foot flag mast was installed at the front of the main building of the station at a cost of 1.5 million. Weighing around 2 tonnes, the mast is made of galvanised iron pipes. The mast is one of the tallest in the city. The polyester-and-cotton flag is 60-ft wide and weighs around 9.5 kg, and can be hoisted both manually and electronically.  Connectivity  Moore Market Complex, the suburban terminal of Chennai Central Passenger and Suburban trains at Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station Chennai Central is a hub for suburban trains. Suburban lines originating from Chennai Central include West North Line, North Line, and West Line. Chennai Park suburban station is in proximity to the station, thus facilitating connectivity to Tambaram/Chengalpet/Tirumalpur routes through South Line and South West Line. Chennai Central can be directly reached from all suburban stations and MRTS stations in and around Chennai (except Washermanpet and Royapuram) either through its own MMC Complex for suburban trains or through the nearby Park suburban station or the Park Town MRTS station. Currently, there is only one direct suburban train that plies from Chennai Beach Junction to Chennai Central via Washermanpet and Royapuram, and hence there is no frequent direct connectivity for these two stations to Chennai Central. The Chennai Park Town MRTS station is close to Chennai Central station. An underground metro station of the ongoing Chennai Metro Rail project is under construction at the Chennai Central station. It is one of the two metro stations where Corridor I (Blue Line) (Airport‚ÄìTiruvottiyur) of the project will intersect with Corridor II (Green Line) (Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Metro‚ÄìSt. Thomas Mount via Egmore, Puratchi Thalaivi Dr. J. Jayalalithaa CMBT Metro). The metro station, being constructed at a depth of , will be the largest of all metro stations in the city with an area of over . The station will act as a transit point for passengers from the Central, Park Town, and Park railway stations. It is estimated that more than 100,000 commuters will utilise the station daily. Chennai Central is connected to the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G.R Bus Terminus and other parts of the city by buses operated by the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, by means of separate bus lanes near the main entrance, close to the concourse. There are prepaid auto and taxi stands at the station premises. However, only 30 autorickshaws are presently attached to the prepaid counter parking, as Chennai Metro Rail has acquired its parking area for station construction. The terminus is connected to the Park railway station and the Government General Hospital by two subways on either side. The two subways, which are one of the first in the city, are used by thousands of commuters day round. Nevertheless, jaywalking prevails as a substantial number of commuters prefer crossing the road, at times resulting in accidents. The terminus is connected with the Egmore station, the other most important terminus of the city, by a circuitous and congested route covering a distance of 11.2 km via Chennai Beach. There was initially a proposal to connect the two termini by means of an elevated section with double-line broad-gauge electrified track with two elevated platforms at M.G.R Chennai Central, at the cost of 930 million, which would cut the distance to 2.5 km. The project, approved on 8 April 2003 and initially aimed to be completed by 2005, was later scrapped owing to the expected rate of return on the project being only 1 to 2 percent, poor soil conditions on the Poonamallee High Road, and other issues.  Environmental impact  The portion of the Buckingham canal running near the terminus and beneath Pallavan Salai is covered for 250 m, which makes the task of maintaining the canal difficult. After being desilted in 1998, the covered stretch of the canal near the terminus was cleaned in September 2012. Garbage is dumped into the canal via the openings near the Chennai Central premises. An estimated 6,000 cubic meters of silt was removed from the 2-m-deep canal.  Incidents  On 14 August 2006, a major fire broke out in Chennai Central, completely destroying a bookshop. On 29 April 2009, a suburban EMU train from Chennai Central Suburban terminal was hijacked by an unidentified man, who rammed it into a stationary goods train at the Vyasarpadi Jeeva railway station, northwest of Chennai Central. Four passengers were killed and 11 were injured. The train, which was scheduled to depart at 5:15 am, started at 4:50 am instead. The train was moving with a speed of 92 km per hour with 35 passengers on board at the time of collision. On 6 August 2012, a man hailing from Nepal perched atop the clock tower of the station's main building, creating a commotion. He was later safely persuaded back down the tower by the City Police and Southern Railway officials. On 1 May 2014, the station witnessed two low-intensity blasts in two coaches S4 and S5 of the stationary Bangalore-Guwahati express, killing one female passenger and injuring at least fourteen. In April 2020, all trains were cancelled till the 30th of September due to COVID-19.  Security  In a first of its kind for the railways, a bomb disposal squad of the railway protection force, equipped with state-of- the-art gadgets imported at a cost of over 2.5 million, was inaugurated at Chennai Central on May 2002. The squad functions round the clock and its personnel were trained at the National Security Guard Training Centre at Maneswar and the Tamil Nadu Commando School. In 2009, following the train accident at the Vyasarpadi Jeeva station, surveillance cameras were installed at the suburban terminus platforms. A security boundary wall 200 m long was erected along platform 14 to check unauthorised persons entering the station. Two security booths were planned, one each at the main terminus and the suburban terminus. A government railway police (GRP) station is located on the first floor at the western end, headed by a DSP and two inspectors. In 2009, 39 CCTV cameras were installed in the premises along with a control room. In 2012, about 120 CCTV cameras are to be installed in Chennai Central. In April 2012, the GRP and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) together launched a helpline known as Kaakum karangal (literally meaning 'Protecting hands'). This involved dividing the terminus into six sectors and deploying 24 police personnel for security. On 15 November 2012, Integrated Security System (ISS) was launched at the station, which comprises sub-systems such as CCTV surveillance system with 54 IP-based cameras, under-vehicle scanning system (UVSS) for entries and exits, and personal and X-ray baggage screening system. In addition, explosive detection and disposal squad have been deployed. The sub-system will be integrated by networking and monitored at the centralised control rooms. Existing CCTV network of suburban platforms has also been integrated to this system.  Future  In 2004, a second terminal was planned near the Moore Market Complex, with six platforms to be constructed in the first phase of the project and four platforms each in the second and third phases. For additional infrastructure, the goods yard at Salt Cotaurs will be closed to provide more pit line and stabling line facilities for the new terminal. In 2007, the Railway Board declared a plan to develop the terminus into a world-class one at a cost of , along with two other stations (Thiruvananthapuram Central and Mangaluru Central), and a high-level committee was formed in 2009 to expedite the project at a total cost of . The plan included creating multi-level platforms where express and suburban trains could arrive and depart from the same complex. However, the project is yet to begin. In June 2012, the first skywalk in Chennai connecting Chennai Central, Park Railway Station and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital was planned at a cost of . It will be long, linking the station with nine points, including Evening Bazaar, Government Medical College and Ripon Buildings on Poonamallee High Road. In February 2013, as part of a national initiative to eliminate ballast tracks at major stations, washable aprons‚Äîballastless tracks or tracks on a concrete bed‚Äîwere installed along the entire length of tracks of platforms 3, 4 and 5 at the terminus. Washable aprons that are already present for a few metres in some of the platforms at the terminus will be extended, viz. on platform 3, on platform 4, and on platform 5, while new ones will be built on platforms with ballast tracks. Chennai Central is among the 23 stations in the country that will be privatised as part of redevelopment under the BFOT (Build, Finance, Operate, Transfer) scheme. More passengers amenities will be provided on a 1.545-acre plot of land adjacent to the Moore Market Suburban complex allotted for commercial exploitation. Additional space for operational purposes, including the station master's room, passenger information centre, movement control room, Railway Protection Force control room containing closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, Government Railway Police station, and Travelling Ticket Examiner chart room, covering a total of 2,873.76 square metres will be built. The developer will maintain the station premises for 15 years, while the lease period of the additional land and aerial space to be developed will be 45 years. In 2017, the state government proposed to build a commercial square called the Central Square in the around the station. On 6 March 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at an NDA political rally in the presence of Railways Minister Piyush Goyal that the station will be renamed after the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran. On 5 April 2019, the station was officially renamed as Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station. The renaming ran into controversy when Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo wrote to the Election Commission of India claiming that the timing of the renaming violated the model code of conduct for the 2019 Indian general election. The new name is currently the India's longest and world's second longest name for a railway station after Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch in Wales, United Kingdom.  In popular culture  Chennai Central railway station is one of the most prominent landmarks in the city that is often featured in movies and other pop culture in the region. The station has been used in numerous Indian novels and film and television productions over the years. Many films and television programs have been filmed at the station, including: * Cochin Express (1967) (Malayalam) * No.20 Madras Mail (1990) (Malayalam) * Kadhal Kottai (1996) (Tamil) * Mudhalvan (1999) (Tamil) * Kushi (2000) (Tamil) * Roja Kootam (2002) (Tamil) * Madrasapattinam (2010) (Tamil) * Siruthai (2011) (Tamil) * Thodari (2016) (Tamil) * Bigil (2019) (Tamil) The station has been poetized by Vijay Nambisan in his 1988 award-winning poem 'Madras Central' published in 1989. The poem is regarded as a modern classic. In 2009, the Department of Posts featured Chennai Central in a postal stamp.

(8 March 2011). Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. In R. A. Pagon, T. D. Bird, C. R. Dolan, & K. Stephens (Eds.), GeneReviews. Seattle, WA: University of Washington. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1196/ which results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower extremities. The symptoms are caused by a genetic mutation that results in an expansion of abnormal \\"CAG\\" trinucleotide repeats in the ATXN3 gene that results in an abnormal form of the protein ataxin which causes degeneration of cells in the hindbrain. Some symptoms, such as clumsiness and rigidity, make MJD commonly mistaken for drunkenness or Parkinson's disease. Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease is a type of spinocerebellar ataxia and is the most common cause of autosomal-dominant ataxia. MJD causes ophthalmoplegia and mixed sensory and cerebellar ataxia. Symptoms Symptoms of MJD are memory deficits, spasticity, difficulty with speech and swallowing, weakness in arms and legs, clumsiness, frequent urination and involuntary eye movements. Symptoms can begin in early adolescence and they get worse over time. Eventually, MJD leads to paralysis; however, intellectual functions usually remain the same. Genetics Flores and S√£o Miguel are centers of the Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease in the Azores. Machado Joseph's disease has multiple origins as SCA3 comes from haplotype of four different origins and was not from one origin in the Azores. Japan, Brazil and France all have been founder effects in areas with SCA3. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) on the Azores are believed to have come from Portugal's northeast where Sephardic Jews lived. Belgium, French-Guiana and Algeria have their own MJD mutation origins. Portuguese have two mutations, while Brazil and France have one mutation, and Germans make up the majority of MJD patients in the United States. Azorean MJD sufferers have their locus on the 14q24.3-32 chromosome, the same as some Japanese with MJD. It was an Azorean, William Machado, whose offspring in New England were the first to be diagnosed with MJD. The Azorean Joseph family, living in California, were also diagnosed with MJD. The same origin for MJD is found in the Azores and in America's north-west coast. Not only Portuguese have it since African Americans, Indians, Italians and Japanese also developed MJD. In China, the mutation causing SCA type 3 has been estimated to have occurred 8,000 to 17,000 years ago. In Japan, the oldest causative mutation appears to have occurred about 5774 +/- 1116 years ago. Among aboriginal Australians, the founder mutation appears to have occurred about 7000 years ago. As this mutation is shared with other families based in Asia it seems likely that it was imported into Australia. MJD affected Azoreans and Japanese had haplotypes in common while Azoreans also had haplotypes of two different origins. Pathophysiology The disease is caused by a mutation in the ATXN3 gene, which is located on chromosome 14q (14q32.1). In exon 10 the gene contains lengthy irregular repetitions of the code \\"CAG\\", producing a mutated protein called ataxin-3. (Normally, the number of copies is between 13 and 41.) MJD is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that if either parent gives the defective gene to a child, the child will show symptoms of the disease. Therefore, if one parent suffers from this disease and the other parent does not, there will be a 50% chance of their child inheriting the disease. The pons (a structure located on the brain stem) is one of the areas affected by MJD. The striatum (a brain area connected to balance and movement) is also affected by this disease, which could explain both of the main motor problems cause by MJD: the tightening and twisting of the limb and the abrupt, irregular movements. In affected cells, this protein builds up and assembles intranuclear inclusion bodies. These insoluble aggregates are hypothesized to interfere with the normal activity of the nucleus and induce the cell to degenerate and die. Diagnosis MJD can be diagnosed by recognizing the symptoms of the disease and by taking a family history. Physicians ask patients questions about the kind of symptoms relatives with the disease had, the progression and harshness of symptoms, and the ages of onset in family members. Presymptomatic diagnosis of MJD can be made with a genetic test. The direct detection of the genetic mutation responsible for MJD has been available since 1995. Genetic testing looks at the number of CAG repeats within the coding region of the MJD/ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14. The test will show positive for MJD if this region contains 61-87 repeats, as opposed to the 12-44 repeats found in healthy individuals. A limitation to this test is that if the number of CAG repeats in an individual being tested falls between the healthy and pathogenic ranges (45-60 repeats), then the test cannot predict whether an individual will have MJD symptoms. =Classification= There are five sub-types of MJD that are characterized by the age of onset and range of symptoms. The sub-types illustrate a wide variety of symptoms that patients can experience. However, assigning individuals to a specific sub-type of the disease is of limited clinical significance. * Type I affects approximately 13% of individuals with MJD and has onset of symptoms between the ages of 10 and 30 years old. It usually progresses quickly, with patients experiencing severe rigidity and dystonia. * Type II is the most common sub-type, affecting approximately 57% of individuals with MJD and symptoms typically begin between 20 and 50 years of age. It has an intermediate rate of progression and causes symptoms that include ataxia and spasticity, along with other upper motor neuron signs such as exaggerated deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). * Type III occurs in approximately 30% of MJD patients and has a relatively slow progression, with symptoms typically arising between the ages of 40 and 70. Symptoms include muscle twitching and cramps, unpleasant sensations such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and hands, and limb muscle atrophy. Nearly all patients experience a decline in their vision experienced as blurred vision, double vision, inability to control eye movements, and/or loss of capability to distinguish color. Some patients also experience Parkinsonian symptoms. * Type IV is distinguished by Parkinsonian symptoms that respond particularly well to levodopa treatment. * Type V appears to resemble Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia; however, more research is needed to conclude the relationship between Type V MJD and hereditary spastic paraplegia. Treatment There is no cure for Machado-Joseph Disease. However, treatments are available for some symptoms. For example, spasticity can be reduced with antispasmodic drugs, such as baclofen. The Parkinsonian symptoms can be treated with levodopa therapy. Prism glasses can reduce diplopic symptoms. Physiotherapy/Physical Therapy and/or occupational therapy can help patients by prescribing mobility aids to increase the patients' independence, providing gait training, and prescribing exercises to maintain the mobility of various joints and general health to decrease the likelihood of falls or injuries as a result of falls. Walkers and wheelchairs can greatly help the patient with everyday tasks. Some patients will experience difficulties with speech and swallowing, therefore a Speech-Language Pathologist can assist the patients to improve their communicating abilities and their issues with swallowing. Prognosis Patients with severe forms of MJD have a life expectancy of approximately 35 years. Those with mild forms have a normal life expectancy. The cause of death of those who die early is often aspiration pneumonia. History The disease was first identified in 1972. Unlike many other medical conditions, Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease is not named after researchers. It is named after two men (\\"William Machado\\" and \\"Antone Joseph\\") who were the patriarchs of the families in which the condition was initially described. The highest prevalence of the condition is on Australia's Groote Eylandt where 5% of the population are currently symptomatic or at risk, followed by the Azorean island of Flores where around 1 in 140 individuals in the population are diagnosed with MJD. Notable cases Brazilian comedian, actor and TV personality Guilherme Karam was diagnosed with Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease, having inherited it from his mother, like his brother and sister. He died on 7 July 2016. In a video on Facebook just days after Karam's death, Brazilian personality, journalist and television presenter, Arnaldo Duran publicly acknowledged his affliction with Machado-Joseph. Brazilian press gave huge attention to both cases. Ethical consideration Ethicists have used Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease as a paradigmatic illness to discuss the rights of a community of patients to control \\"ownership\\" of their disease, particularly when it comes to research on genetic testing. Also, as there currently is no clinical intervention to prevent the onset of the disease symptoms, there is discourse over whether individuals should get tested or not. The benefits of having MJD testing include a reduction in anxiety and uncertainty, and the ability to plan for the future. Some disadvantages include the anticipation of negative results and the individual's difficulties in adapting to this outcome. For an ethnographic case study exploring some of the social and ethical consequences of living with Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease, see Jo√£o Biehl's Vita: Life in a Zone of Social Abandonment (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006).

The college was run by Kanyakumari Diocese of the Church of South India. It is one of the three colleges of the southern districts, along with Scott Christian College and South Travancore Hindu College, to be accredited by NAAC as a 5 Star institution. History In the year 1868, Rev. James Emlyn from New Castle, U.K. an LMS missionary bought the lands where the college is located now. Rev. Robert Sinclair, who succeeded Rev. Emlyn in the year 1910, built a bungalow and started a boarding school on the campus measuring 32 acres. After independence, the long-felt need for a college at Marthandam resulted in the starting of the Christian College in June 1964 by the Kanyakumari Diocese of the Church of South India. The Executive Committee of the Diocese, which met on 04-01-1964, entrusted the responsibility of raising funds for the buildings needed to an ad-hoc committee consisting of Messrs. N. Dennis, Ex. MP(Convener) G.A. Ambrose, J. Nesamony, P.S. Wilson and Rev. M.Amose. The Diocese set apart sufficient extent of wetlands as an endowment to satisfy the University requirement. The public in and around Marthandam, the parents, students and members of the teaching and non-teaching staff took a keen interest in the growth of the college and contributed substantial amounts at different times for its development. With the permission of the Madras University, the Pre-University class was started in 1964 with just 171 students. The college was inaugurated on 6 August 1964 by the then Bishop Rt. Rev. I.R.H. Gnanadason. In June 1984, the College was renamed as Nesamony Memorial Christian College in recognition of the service rendered by the late Thiru. A. Nesamony M.A, B.L to the Kanyakumari Diocese of the Church of South India. The College is accredited with \\"A\\" Grade by the NAAC. Patron The Patron of the institution is Marshal A. Nesamony. He was born in 1895 at Nesarpuram in Vilavancode taluk, Kanyakumari District. He graduated at Trivandrum Maharaja College, Thiruvananthapuram, and studied law at Law College, Thiruvananthapuram. He was among the people who had a role in merging South Travancore (Kanyakumari) to Tamil Nadu. Administration The institution is owned and managed by the Kanyakumari Diocese of the Church of South India. The Executive committee of the Diocese appoints the Principal of the college. The College Governing Board, constituted by the Diocese, makes all other appointments subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The Major Financial and administrative policies of the College are formulated by the Governing Board. The general administration of the College vests in the Principal. He is assisted by the Vice-Principal in the day-to-day administration of the College. Emblem The emblem of the college bears a Cross, a Church, a Palmyrah tree, a Star, a Book and a Lotus flower. The Cross indicates that the college is a Christian institution. The Church signifies sanctification, as one gets sanctification through prayers. The Palmyrah tree is a feature of the district where the college is located. At the top is a star which stands for guidance. The open Book and the Lotus, India‚Äôs National flower, symbolize Knowledge and Wisdom respectively. The motto of the institution is \\"Faith, Endeavour and Power\\".

He is credited with the invention of the modern 3-point safety belt, now a standard safety feature in all cars. Bohlin worked on the seat belt for about a year, using skills in developing ejection seats for SAAB; he concentrated on keeping the driver safe in a car accident. After testing the 3-point safety belt, he introduced his invention to the Volvo company in 1959 and received his first patent (number 3,043,625). Ten years later, he led the Central Research and Development Department for Volvo in 1969. In 1974, he was awarded The Ralph Isbrandt Automotive Safety Engineering Award, and in 1989 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Safety and Health. He received a gold medal from Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in 1995 and in 1999, was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. He retired from Volvo as Senior Engineer in 1985 and was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Personal background During his adult life, he was married to Maj-Britt Bohlin. He was stepfather to Maj-Britts two sons and then had 2 children together and 13 grandchildren. Nils Bohlin died on September 21, 2002 at the age of 82, of a heart attack and was buried at Torpa Church in Ramfall, Sweden. Effects on history The three-point seat belt changed the world by preventing injuries during a car crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that the seat belt saves about 15,000 lives per year in the US. In addition to designing an effective three-point belt, Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden, and presented a paper at the 11th Stapp Car Crash Convention. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. This study resulted in the U.S. Department of Transportation requiring three-point seat belts in American cars. In 1968, the new seat belt design was made free for the public to use. In most industrial countries, occupants are required by law to use seat belts. References   * * Book Ref: Dredge, Richard.

It lies to the west of New Georgia, but is considered one of the New Georgia Group. To its west are the Treasury Islands. Environment The island of Vella Lavella is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. To the north is the island of Choiseul, to the northwest is the island of Shortland, and to the southeast is the island of New Georgia. Vella Lavella is a volcanic island, surrounded in some places by a coral reef. The island contains volcanic cones and one thermal spring. The highest elevation is Mount Tambisala at . The volcano Nonda (the youngest volcano of the island), has an elevation of 750 meters and is considered active, although it has never erupted in modern times. The smaller rivers running from the mountains to the coast allow irrigated horticulture to the inhabitants who live almost exclusively on the coast. Vella Lavella is mainly vegetated with lowland rainforest. The climate is wet and tropical, and the island is prone to earthquakes and cyclones. =North-west Vella Lavella Important Bird Area= An area of 14,641 ha in the north-west of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of white-winged fantails, Kolombangara monarchs and endemic Vella Lavella white-eyes. The main threat facing the site is logging. History Painted potshards found during excavations date back to an age of 2,000 to 3,000 years. The Bilua language spoken on the island belongs to the Papuan languages, while the other languages of the Solomon Islands belong to the Austronesian languages. Therefore, archaeologists suspect the immigration of a people who did not come from the Melanesian settlement area. On March 15, 1893 Vella Lavella was declared part of the British Solomon Islands protectorate. The island was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the early stages of the Pacific War. The Land Battle of Vella Lavella was fought between Allied and Japanese forces from 15 August ‚Äì 6 October 1943. After a landing at Barakoma on 15 August, US troops advanced along the coasts, pushing the Japanese north. In September, New Zealand troops took over from the Americans and they continued to advance across the island, hemming the small Japanese garrison consisting of 250 Japanese personnel, who were a mix of soldiers evacuated from New Georgia and sailors who had been stranded on the island,Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II, p. 68 along the north coast. On 6 October, the Japanese began an evacuation operation to withdraw the remaining troops, during which the Naval Battle of Vella Lavella was fought. Following the capture of the island, the Allies developed it into an important airbase which was used in the reduction of main Japanese base at Rabaul. Subsequently, Barakoma Airfield on Vella Lavella was the home base for VMF-214 (the \\"Black Sheep,\\" led by Gregory Boyington).The TV series Baa, Baa, Black Sheep renamed the island \\"Vella La Cava.\\" Since 1978, the island has been part of the independent state of the Solomon Islands. Notable local people * Milna Tozaka was elected to the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands to represent the North Vella Lavella Constituency on 5 April 2006. He is the current Foreign Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Rick Douglas Hou; he has previously served as the Minister for Public Service.

The company used to run a club night of the same name at their nightclub AIR, in Birmingham. Godskitchen has an in-house music label. This label annually releases compilation albums, in addition to supporting new artists whom they believe bring something new to the genre. The brand retired in 2016 with \\"Last Dance\\" events in Sydney in April, Melbourne in May and Birmingham in June 2016, although recent Facebook activity has suggested an event in February 2018 in Birmingham. Roots Godskitchen's roots date back to the golden era of the UK rave scene of the early 1990s. First events They held their first event in the UK at the Junction Nightclub in Cambridge, launching a series of sell out nights across the UK. Thereafter, Chris Griffin and Tyrone Matthews decided they would launch Godskitchen on a regular basis. In May 1996, Godskitchen began to hold weekly events in Northampton. Godskitchen sold out regularly, soon filling the 1,500 capacity Planet Nightclub in Coventry every Friday night. Scaling up in Milton Keynes and Birmingham In 1997 Chris and Tyrone staged an event for 4,000 people at the Sanctuary Music Arena in Milton Keynes. Billed as Britain's first \\"stadium house music event\\" the party sold out in advance at a venue that fellow superclubbers Cream had failed to fill only 12 months previously. Looking for a \\"somewhere to call home\\", Godskitchen moved to the 2,000 capacity Sanctuary Nightclub (formerly the Digbeth Institute) in Digbeth, Birmingham. Godskitchen filled the Sanctuary on a regular basis. 1999 saw Godskitchen take their clubbing to the Amnesia Nightclub in Ibiza, pulling in up to 5,500 revellers on a Tuesday night. Godskitchen continued to flourish on Ibiza for another three seasons, moving to Eden in San Antonio for one summer in 2002. Back in Birmingham, Godskitchen continued to go from strength to strength. Neil Moffitt was now on board and Godskitchen began work on a nightclub of their own, the superclub \\"CODE\\". The club opened its doors in the autumn of 2000 and, it is claimed, reached capacity and had to turn away over 20,000 people on its first night. With Friday's Godskitchen fast becoming synonymous with the trance sound, Godskitchen launched two further clubbing nights at CODE. Saturday night saw Babooshka filling the 2000 capacity venue for a second time each weekend, entertaining the masses with its glamorous style of U.S. house music and UK garage, while Sundays played host to the mixed night Polysexual, which continues to be one of the UK's most successful names in hard dance. 2003 and 2004 featured 'The Strongbow Rooms' that housed performances from the likes of Medicine 8. In June 2003, CODE was closed for a significant renovation and reopened in late September 2003 as AIR. Expanding into the north of England, the first Godskitchen night was launched at Club Mission in Leeds on February 8, 2008, and has become a monthly occurrence at the club. Godskitchen at AIR GlobalGathering In the summer of 2001, Godskitchen staged their first outdoor festival, Godskitchen GlobalGathering, which saw 25,000 partygoers descend upon Long Marston Airfield on the Gloucestershire/Warwickshire border near Stratford-upon-Avon on a balmy July evening. The venue was a British summertime veteran, which had previously played host to the Phoenix Festival and the Bulldog Bash. GlobalGathering was a major success, and Godskitchen finished 2001 by returning to one of their original homes, The Sanctuary Music Arena in Milton Keynes. 2002 saw the capacity of GlobalGathering increase to 35,000 and in 2003 Godskitchen completely transformed their home venue CODE, renaming it AIR. AIR now featured three rooms. As well as staging yet another GlobalGathering, 2003 saw Godskitchen embark on an arena tour, selling out parties at the Telewest Arena in Newcastle upon Tyne and The National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, then the UK's largest venue. 2004 saw financial controversy with the company holding the \\"CODE\\" venue going into receivership subsequent to the ¬£1 million refurbishment of the venue (GK Entertainment Ltd. Reg company no.03937005) GK entertainment was a subsidiary company of Godskitchen and GK entertainment LTD was subsequently put into receivership. The receivers were appointed and spoke to the company's current and recently departed directors Neil Moffitt, James Algate and Chris Griffin. GK entertainment was then closed down but Godskitchen and Godskitchen LTD was unaffected and continued to trade Global Gathering International tours After another successful year and GlobalGathering in 2004, Godskitchen took the party overseas to Ireland and the US, staging events across the continent. New Year's Eve 2004/2005 saw Godskitchen hold their last Friday night in Birmingham, moving to Saturdays in 2005 in order to compete in what many had come to see as a flagging market. The final jewel in the Godskitchen crown was to take place in July 2005: GlobalGathering was expanded to cover an entire weekend (complete with camping) and the Friday night saw a fresh music policy with more emphasis placed on live acts. The capacity was again increased to 45,000 and the following day saw Godskitchen take GlobalGathering to Ireland for a 15,000 capacity event in Cork. Global Gathering 2006 was held in the downtown area of Miami, Florida on 18 March that year. The success of that event spawned a second US festival held on Labor Day weekend (first weekend of September in the US) at Las Vegas, Nevada. Godskitchen events are held at Club Bonbon in Shanghai as well as in Manila, Philippines in 2007 and 2008. Australia held its first GlobalGathering in 2008 (a day rave for one day only) after many successful annual Godskitchen events. In 2010, for the first time the event was held in Papaya Club on Zrce Beach in Croatia. It lasted three days, 11-13 August. Artists who performed include Axwell, Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso, Gareth Emery, and Arno Cost. Godskitchen The name While trying to come up with a name for their new house night, promoters Chris Griffin and Tyrone Matthews observed that the best house parties always seem to gravitate around the kitchen. They soon concluded that the very best parties would be held in God's kitchen, hence the name. This name was also used by the 1980s synthpop group Blancmange who produced a song called \\"God's Kitchen\\", although the two may not have been connected.

Commonly known as big-eyed bugs, the species in Geocoris are beneficial predators, but are often confused with the true chinch bug, which is a pest. There are more than 140 described species in Geocoris.  Description  Big- eyed bugs are true bugs in the order Hemiptera. The two most common species are Geocoris pallens and Geocoris punctipes. Both are predators and occur in many habitats, including fields, gardens, and turf grass. Big-eyed bugs are considered an important predator in many agricultural systems and feed on mites, insect eggs, and small insects such as pink bollworm, cabbage loopers, and whiteflies. Adult big-eyed bugs are small (about ) black, gray, or tan with proportionately large eyes. Eggs are deposited singly or in clusters on leaves near potential prey. They develop with incomplete metamorphosis (there is no pupa) and take approximately 30 days to develop from egg to adult depending on temperature. Both nymphs and adults are predatory, but can survive on nectar and honeydew when prey are scarce. Big-eyed bugs, like other true bugs, have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by stabbing their prey and sucking or lapping the juices. Although their effectiveness as predators is not well understood, studies have shown that nymphs can eat as many as 1600 spider mites before reaching adulthood, while adults have been reported consuming as many as 80 mites per day.

Fauvism Vauxcelles was born in Paris. He coined the phrase 'les fauves' (translated as 'wild beasts') in a 1905 review of the Salon d'Automne exhibit to describe in a mocking, critical manner a circle of painters associated with Matisse. As their paintings were exposed in the same room as a Donatello sculpture of which he approved, he stated his criticism and disapproval of their works by describing the sculpture as \\"a Donatello amongst the wild beasts.\\" Henri Matisse's Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra) appeared at the 1907 Ind√©pendants, entitled Tableau no. III. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of Nu bleu: > I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass > of an opaque blue under the palm trees... This is an artistic effect tending > toward the abstract that escapes me completely. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 > March 1907)Russell T.

Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. > Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907). Cubism In 1906 Jean Metzinger formed a close friendship with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New YorkDaniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 ‚Äì 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, DortmundArt of the 20th Century In 1908, Vauxcelles again, in his review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kahnweiler's gallery called Braque a daring man who despises form, \\"reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes\\".Louis Vauxcelles, Exposition Braques, Gil Blas, 14 November 1908Alex Danchev, Georges Braques: A Life, Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005 Vauxcelles recounts how Matisse told him at the time, \\"Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 Salon d'Automne] a painting made of little cubes\\". The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse's words and spoke of Braque's little cubes. The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.Futurism in Paris - The Avant-garde Explosion, Pompidou Center, Paris 2008 On 25 March 1909, Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants as \\"bizarreries cubiques\\" (cubic oddities).Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon des Ind√©pendants, Gil Blas, 25 March 1909, Gallica (BnF) Vauxcelles, this time in his review of the 26th Salon des Ind√©pendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Henri Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Fernand L√©ger, as \\"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\\"Louis Vauxcelles, A travers les salons: promenades aux Ind√©pendants, Gil Blas, 18 March 1910Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J.

Vauxcelles acknowledged the importance of C√©zanne to the Cubists in his article titled From C√©zanne to Cubism (published in Eclair, 1920). For Vauxcelles the influence had a two-fold character, both 'architectural' and 'intellectual'. He stressed the statement made by √âmile Bernard that C√©zanne's optics were \\"not in the eye, but in his brain\\".Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28, Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987, p. 192 In 1911 he coined the less well-known term Tubism in describing the style of Fernand L√©ger.N√©ret, 1993, p. 42 Legacy In 1906 Louis Vauxcelles was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and in 1925 he was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour.Minist√®re de la Culture et de la Communication, Base L√©onore, Archives Nationales, Culture.gouv.fr Towards the end of his life, in 1932, Vauxcelles published a monographic essay about Marek Szwarc, dedicated to the Jewish character of Szwarc's oeuvre. > \\"His art, which plunges its roots into the past of the ghettos and in which > the moving accent like the ancient songs in the synagogue of Wilna, is a > return to popular imagery.

He was noted as an expert marksman, frontiersman and hunter. He had also been a scout with Buffalo Bill. Biography Charles Alexander Reynolds was born in Warren County, Illinois. He was the son of a physician and moved with his family to Kansas in his teens. He attended Abingdon College, but left in 1860 to join the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he became known as \\"Lonesome\\" Charley Reynolds due to his drifting from state to state and job to job, and how he kept his life's details private. In 1865, he was a trader; in 1866, a buffalo hunter; and so on. In 1867, he had a quarrel with an Army officer at Fort McPherson, and when it was done, the officer only had one arm left. Reynolds left that area and became a hunter and guide. He met George Armstrong Custer in 1869. He was soon a scout for Custer's U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment. During Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition, he carried unaccompanied the dispatches to Fort Laramie that made the discovery of gold public. The night before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he had premonitions and gave away his personal items to the soldiers. As they were riding toward the Indian village prior to the battle, Reynolds, who never drank, asked interpreter Fred Gerard for some whiskey. He also indicated that he had never felt so discouraged or depressed in his life. He was later killed in the battle. Some accounts suggest that he may have been defending a doctor who was treating a wounded soldier. His body was buried on the battlefield and his grave crudely marked. Later, as with all of Custer's slain soldiers and civilians, a white marble slab was erected to mark the spot where he fell. His remains, and those of his comrades, were collected and reinterred on Custer Hill. An obelisk commemorates the dead.

It was the major arms supplier to the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War. The same company name was used during World War I to import arms from America such as the Colt New Service Revolver in 455 Eley.http://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/380687 History The company was founded on February 9, 1856, with its factory established on the former site of the South-Eastern Railway Company in the Bermondsey section of London. The principal shareholder was Robert Adams, inventor of the Adams revolver. Another important stockholder was Adams' cousin, James Kerr, who later invented the Kerrs Patent Revolver. Adams had had a falling-out with his former partners, the Deane brothers, and intended that the Armoury manufacture his popular revolver. However the company obtained a British government contract for infantry rifles and in 1859 the company's board of directors decided to expand rifle production, for which there was greater demand. Revolver production was decreased and Adams, disagreeing with the decision, sold his stock and left the company. Kerr then became the Armoury's dominant figure. Kerr, a former foreman at Deane Brothers, made improvements to the Enfield 1853 pattern rifled musket which the Armoury was manufacturing under contract. When Adams left the company he had taken his revolver patents with him, and Kerr therefore designed a new revolver in .36 and .44 (54 bore) caliber. Production of the new revolver began in April 1859, but the company was not able to obtain a contract for it from the British government and civilian sales were modest. =American Civil War= However the following year the American Civil War began and the governments of both the United States and the Confederacy began purchasing arms in Britain. In November 1861 buyers for the Union army purchased 16 Kerr revolvers for $18.00 apiece. Two years later Confederate arms buyers Major Caleb Huse and Captain James Bulloch contracted for all the rifles and revolvers the Armoury could produce. The British company Willoughbe, Willoughbe & Ponsonby played a prominent role in the blockade running of these shipments to the south. The Confederacy was now the London Armoury Company's principal client and it manufactured and shipped more than 70,000 rifles and about 7,000 revolvers (out of a total production run of about 10,000) to the South. However these weapons had to pass through the Union blockade and the number that actually reached the Confederate army is unknown. Confederates acclaimed the Armoury's guns as the best weapons made in Britain.Katcherl, 2003 p.54 The London Armoury Company was almost completely dependent on sales to the Confederacy and survived for only a year after the end of the war, dissolving in the Spring of 1866- however, most of the gunsmiths and staff of the London Armoury Company went on to form London Small Arms Co. Ltd in that same year.

These are software products available with its source code under an open-source license to study, change, and improve its design. Examples of some popular open-source software products are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, Android, LibreOffice and the VLC media player. Open- source software development has been a large part of the creation of the World Wide Web as we know it, with Tim Berners-Lee contributing his HTML code development as the original platform upon which the internet is now built.  History  In 1997, Eric S. Raymond wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar.Raymond, E.S. (1999). The Cathedral & the Bazaar. O'Reilly Retrieved from http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/. See also: The Cathedral and the Bazaar. In this book, Raymond makes the distinction between two kinds of software development. The first is the conventional closed-source development. This kind of development method is, according to Raymond, like the building of a cathedral; central planning, tight organization and one process from start to finish. The second is the progressive open-source development, which is more like \\"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.\\" The latter analogy points to the discussion involved in an open-source development process. Differences between the two styles of development, according to Bar and Fogel, are in general the handling (and creation) of bug reports and feature requests, and the constraints under which the programmers are working.Bar, M. & Fogel, K. (2003). Open Source Development with CVS, 3rd Edition. Paraglyph Press. () In closed-source software development, the programmers are often spending a lot of time dealing with and creating bug reports, as well as handling feature requests. This time is spent on creating and prioritizing further development plans. This leads to part of the development team spending a lot of time on these issues, and not on the actual development. Also, in closed-source projects, the development teams must often work under management-related constraints (such as deadlines, budgets, etc.) that interfere with technical issues of the software. In open-source software development, these issues are solved by integrating the users of the software in the development process, or even letting these users build the system themselves.  Model  Process-Data Model for open-source software development Open-source software development can be divided into several phases. The phases specified here are derived from Sharma et al.Sharma, S., Sugumaran, V. & Rajagopalan, B. (2002). A framework for creating hybrid-open source software communities. Information Systems Journal 12 (1), 7 ‚Äì 25. A diagram displaying the process-data structure of open-source software development is shown on the right. In this picture, the phases of open-source software development are displayed, along with the corresponding data elements. This diagram is made using the meta-modeling and meta-process modeling techniques. = Starting an open-source project = There are several ways in which work on an open-source project can start: # An individual who senses the need for a project announces the intent to develop a project in public. # A developer working on a limited but working codebase, releases it to the public as the first version of an open-source program. # The source code of a mature project is released to the public. # A well- established open-source project can be forked by an interested outside party. Eric Raymond observed in his essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar that announcing the intent for a project is usually inferior to releasing a working project to the public. It's a common mistake to start a project when contributing to an existing similar project would be more effective (NIH syndrome). To start a successful project it is very important to investigate what's already there. The process starts with a choice between the adopting of an existing project, or the starting of a new project. If a new project is started, the process goes to the Initiation phase. If an existing project is adopted, the process goes directly to the Execution phase.  Types of open- source projects  Several types of open-source projects exist. First, there is the garden variety of software programs and libraries, which consist of standalone pieces of code. Some might even be dependent on other open-source projects. These projects serve a specified purpose and fill a definite need. Examples of this type of project include the Linux kernel, the Firefox web browser and the LibreOffice office suite of tools. Distributions are another type of open-source project. Distributions are collections of software that are published from the same source with a common purpose. The most prominent example of a \\"distribution\\" is an operating system. There are many Linux distributions (such as Debian, Fedora Core, Mandriva, Slackware, Ubuntu etc.) which ship the Linux kernel along with many user-land components. There are other distributions, like ActivePerl, the Perl programming language for various operating systems, and Cygwin distributions of open-source programs for Microsoft Windows. Other open-source projects, like the BSD derivatives, maintain the source code of an entire operating system, the kernel and all of its core components, in one revision control system; developing the entire system together as a single team. These operating system development projects closely integrate their tools, more so than in the other distribution-based systems. Finally, there is the book or standalone document project. These items usually do not ship as part of an open-source software package. The Linux Documentation Project hosts many such projects that document various aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system. There are many other examples of this type of open-source project.  Methods  It is hard to run an open- source project following a more traditional software development method like the waterfall model, because in these traditional methods it is not allowed to go back to a previous phase. In open-source software development, requirements are rarely gathered before the start of the project; instead they are based on early releases of the software product, as Robbins describes.Robbins, J. E. (2003). Adopting Open Source Software Engineering (OSSE) Practices by Adopting OSSE Tools. Making Sense of the Bazaar: Perspectives on Open Source and Free Software, Fall 2003. Besides requirements, often volunteer staff is attracted to help develop the software product based on the early releases of the software. This networking effect is essential according to Abrahamsson et al.: ‚Äúif the introduced prototype gathers enough attention, it will gradually start to attract more and more developers‚Äù. However, Abrahamsson et al. also point out that the community is very harsh, much like the business world of closed- source software: ‚Äúif you find the customers you survive, but without customers you die‚Äù.Abrahamsson, P, Salo, O. & Warsta, J. (2002). Agile software development methods: Review and Analysis. VTT Publications. FuggettaFuggetta, A. (2003). Open source software ‚Äì an evaluation, Journal of Systems and Software, 66, 77 ‚Äì 90. argues that ‚Äúrapid prototyping, incremental and evolutionary development, spiral lifecycle, rapid application development, and, recently, extreme programming and the agile software process can be equally applied to proprietary and open source software‚Äù. He also pinpoints Extreme Programming as an extremely useful method for open source software development. More generally, all Agile programming methods are applicable to open-source software development, because of their iterative and incremental character. Other Agile method are equally useful for both open and closed source software development:Internet-Speed Development, for example is suitable for open-source software development because of the distributed development principle it adopts. Internet-Speed Development uses geographically distributed teams to ‚Äòwork around the clock‚Äô. This method, mostly adopted by large closed-source firms, (because they're the only ones which afford development centers in different time zones), works equally well in open source projects because a software developed by a large group of volunteers shall naturally tend to have developers spread across all time zones.  Tools  = Communication channels = Developers and users of an open-source project are not all necessarily working on the project in proximity. They require some electronic means of communications. E-mail is one of the most common forms of communication among open-source developers and users. Often, electronic mailing lists are used to make sure e-mail messages are delivered to all interested parties at once. This ensures that at least one of the members can reply to it. In order to communicate in real time, many projects use an instant messaging method such as IRC. Web forums have recently become a common way for users to get help with problems they encounter when using an open-source product. Wikis have become common as a communication medium for developers and users. = Version control systems = In OSS development the participants, who are mostly volunteers, are distributed amongst different geographic regions so there is need for tools to aid participants to collaborate in the development of source code. During early 2000s, Concurrent Versions System (CVS) was a prominent example of a source code collaboration tool being used in OSS projects. CVS helps manage the files and codes of a project when several people are working on the project at the same time. CVS allows several people to work on the same file at the same time. This is done by moving the file into the users‚Äô directories and then merging the files when the users are done. CVS also enables one to easily retrieve a previous version of a file. During mid 2000s, The Subversion revision control system (SVN) was created to replace CVS. It is quickly gaining ground as an OSS project version control system. Many open-source projects are now using distributed revision control systems, which scale better than centralized repositories such as SVN and CVS. Popular examples are git, used by the Linux kernel, and Mercurial, used by the Python programming language. = Bug trackers and task lists = Most large-scale projects require a bug tracking system to keep track of the status of various issues in the development of the project. Some bug trackers include: * Bugzilla ‚Äì a web- based bug tracker from Mozilla. * Mantis Bug Tracker ‚Äì a web-based PHP/MySQL bug tracker. * Trac ‚Äì integrating a bug tracker with a wiki, and an interface to the Subversion version control system. * Redmine ‚Äì written in Ruby, integrates issue tracking, wiki, forum, news, roadmap, gantt project planning and interfaces with LDAP user directory. * Request tracker ‚Äì written in Perl. Given as a default to CPAN modules ‚Äì see rt.cpan.org. * SourceForge and its forks provide a bug tracker as part of its services. As a result, many projects hosted at SourceForge.net and similar services default to using it. * JIRA ‚Äì Web-based project management and issue tracking tool from Atlassian. = Testing and debugging tools = Since OSS projects undergo frequent integration, tools that help automate testing during system integration are used. An example of such tool is Tinderbox. Tinderbox enables participants in an OSS project to detect errors during system integration. Tinderbox runs a continuous build process and informs users about the parts of source code that have issues and on which platform(s) these issues arise. A debugger is a computer program that is used to debug (and sometimes test or optimize) other programs. GNU Debugger (GDB) is an example of a debugger used in open-source software development. This debugger offers remote debugging, what makes it especially applicable to open-source software development. A memory leak tool or memory debugger is a programming tool for finding memory leaks and buffer overflows. A memory leak is a particular kind of unnecessary memory consumption by a computer program, where the program fails to release memory that is no longer needed. Examples of memory leak detection tools used by Mozilla are the XPCOM Memory Leak tools. Validation tools are used to check if pieces of code conform to the specified syntax. An example of a validation tool is Splint. = Package management = A package management system is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages from a computer. The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) for .rpm and Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) for .deb file format, are package management systems used by a number of Linux distributions.

It was also the last film of noted actor Alexander Scourby. Plot Several railroad workers discover a white cream-like alien substance bubbling out of the ground. These workers find it to be sweet and addictive. Later, the substance, marketed as \\"The Stuff,\\" is being sold to the general public in containers like ice cream. It is marketed as having no calories and as being sweet, creamy, and filling. The Stuff quickly becomes a nationwide craze and drastically hurts the sales of ice cream. Former FBI agent turned industrial saboteur David \\"Mo\\" Rutherford is hired by the leaders of the suffering ice cream industry, as well as junk food mogul Charles W. \\"Chocolate Chip Charlie\\" Hobbs, to find out exactly what The Stuff is and destroy it. Under their commissions, Rutherford conducts an investigation into The Stuff. His efforts reveal, to his initial horror, that the craze for the dessert is far deadlier than anyone had believed: The Stuff is actually a living, parasitic, and possibly sentient organism that gradually takes over the brain; it then mutates those who eat it into bizarre zombie-like creatures, before consuming them from the inside and leaving them empty shells of their former selves. A young boy named Jason also discovers The Stuff is alive and sees how it affects his family and how they are adamantly against his beliefs on The Stuff. He gets arrested for vandalizing a supermarket display of The Stuff, attracting the attention of Rutherford, who comes to his aid. Rutherford also manages to charm Nicole, an advertising executive who becomes his partner and lover when she sees the effect of The Stuff. The trio infiltrates the distribution operation, which is actually an organized corporate effort to spread The Stuff on the basis of eliminating world hunger, and destroy the lake of The Stuff with explosives. Meanwhile, United States Army Col. Malcolm Grommett Spears, a retired soldier, leads a militia in battling the zombies and transmitting a civil defense message for Americans to break their addiction to The Stuff by destroying it with fire. The Stuff addiction is ended, and Rutherford, Nicole, Jason, and Col. Spears are hailed as national heroes. Mo then visits the head of The Stuff Company, a man named Mr. Fletcher. He tells Mo that the destruction of the mine has not hurt his business, since The Stuff seeps out from many places in the ground, but Mo vows to find those places and get rid of them all. Another man, Mr. Vickers, brings in Mr. Evans, the ice cream mogul with whom he is now working‚Äîand who had originally hired Mo to find out about what The Stuff was. They tell him they have come up with a new product that they call \\"The Taste,\\" which is a mix of 88% ice cream and 12% The Stuff, supposedly enough to make people crave more without it taking over their minds or killing them. However, Mo then brings in Jason, who is carrying a box, and then holds the two moguls at gunpoint. The box is full of pint containers of The Stuff, and Mo forces both to eat them all as punishment for all the lives lost to it, and for their greed. As they do, Rutherford asks, \\"Are you eating it or is it eating you?\\" When they finish, Mo and Jason leave them to the approaching police. The film ends with smugglers selling The Stuff on the black market, having one of the smugglers tasting The Stuff, and revealing that samples of The Stuff still exist. In a post-credits scene, a woman in a bathroom (Brooke Adams) says \\"Enough is never enough\\" while holding The Stuff.

He said, \\"My main inspiration was the consumerism and corporate greed found in our country and the damaging products that were being sold. I was constantly reading in the newspapers about various goods and materials being recalled because they were harming people. For example, you had foods being pulled off the market because they were hazardous to people‚Äôs health.\\"Doyle p 324 Cohen was particularly influenced by \\"the sheer volume of junk food we consume every day. We continue to eat these foods despite the fact some of them are killing us. That‚Äôs when I started thinking that The Stuff could be an imaginary product‚Äî in this case an ice cream dessert‚Äî that is being consumed by millions and is doing irreparable damage to humanity. Everybody is gobbling down this yummy food, so how can it possibly be wrong for us?\\"Doyle p 326 Cohen wanted to cast Arsenio Hall as \\"Chocolate Chip Charlie\\" W. Hobbs, since he thought he was not only a good actor but also a rising star. The executives at New World Pictures, however, wanted someone more recognizable and thus cast Garrett Morris instead.About.com ‚Äì 13 Horror Films Starring Comedians Release Cohen says the film was significantly trimmed in post production: > We did lose a few funny scenes that I wanted to keep.

The film was not a hit, and Cohen feels that it was hurt by the fact it was sold as a horror film, when it was basically a satirical comedy. It received positive reviews from critics; on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 67% rating, based on 12 reviews. He claimed \\"the day The Stuff opened in New York a hurricane hit and the newspapers were not delivered. Of course, we had received all these great reviews, but it didn‚Äôt matter because nobody ever got to read a single word of them.\\"Doyle p 344 Home media The film was released on VHS by New World Home Video. It was eventually released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2000. On September 11, 2011, Image Entertainment released The Stuff under its \\"Midnight Madness Series\\" banner on DVD. It is a direct port of the Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release. A Special Edition Blu-ray was released in the United Kingdom on March 10, 2013 by Arrow Films. Copyright dispute The company Effects Associated were hired by Cohen to supply some of the special effects shots. When the shots were delivered, Cohen was not satisfied with shots of exploding factory buildingsThe disputed footage as posted on YouTube and paid only half (c. $8,000) of the agreed price for those shots. Effects Associated brought an action against Cohen in court to claim full compensation, but also because the parties had no written copyright agreement regarding the use of the shots. The trial court decided in favor of Cohen, ruling that there was an \\"implied agreement\\" for the non-exclusive use of the shots in the film. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit confirmed the ruling, and confirmed that Effects Associated still retained the copyright for use outside of The Stuff. Reception Colin Greenland reviewed The Stuff for White Dwarf #77, and stated that \\"A brilliant performance by Cohen stalwart Michael Moriarty as an industrial spy after the truth holds the straggling plot together.\\" See also *The Thing (1982 film) *The Fly (1986 film) *The Blob (1988 film) *Society (film) *Body Snatchers (1993 film) *The Thing (2011 film) References * External links Review of film at AV Club Category:1985 films Category:1985 horror films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:1980s monster movies Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American satirical films Category:American black comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Larry Cohen Category:Fictional amorphous creatures Category:American monster movies Category:Fictional food and drink Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York City Category:American independent films Category:New World Pictures films Category:American parody films Category:1985 comedy films ","title":"The Stuff"},{"id":"2356366","text":"Faction Talk is a subscription-based channel on the satellite radio service Sirius XM Radio. The channel first aired on XM on August 6, 2004 as xL High Voltage in preparation for the launch of the American radio show Opie and Anthony several months later, and required subscribers to purchase the channel as a premium, until 2005. In 2006, the channel was renamed xL the ViRUS and became affiliated with additional radio shows and podcasts, including Ron and Fez. The channel became The Opie and Anthony Channel in 2011, until the firing of host Anthony Cumia led to the channel being renamed SiriusXM Talk from July 2014. Three months later, it was rebranded again as xL Opie Radio and became one of XM's nine \\"XL\\" channels for frequent explicit language. In 2017, following the break up of Opie with Jim Norton, it was renamed to \\"xL Faction Talk\\". History =2004‚Äì2006: High Voltage= Former XM 202 Logo as xL High Voltage On August 5, 2004, radio personalities Gregg \\"Opie\\" Hughes and Anthony Cumia signed a contract to host their Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service from October 4 of that year, from New York City. The two had been out of work since their firing in August 2002 from WNEW-FM in New York City, after station owner Infinity Broadcasting paid them to stay off the air. On the following day, a dedicated channel for the hosts was launched as High Voltage on XM channel 202, a premium channel that cost subscribers an additional $1.99 per month. The name High Voltage was decided by one of XM's lawyers without consulting either host, despite them telling Hughes and Cumia they could think of a name. From the channel's launch to the show's debut broadcast, the channel aired nothing but two 40-second announcements promoting the show's return to the air. At 12:01 a.m. EST on October 1, 2004, the loop was interrupted to air O&A;: Ungagged, a program that marked the duo's first radio appearance since 2002, aired on the XM Comedy, Boneyard, and SquiZZ channels. Opie and Anthony launched on October 4, 2004 and aired weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to around 10:00 a.m. EST, with replays broadcast throughout the day. In late December 2004 through January 3, 2005, WAQX-FM in Syracuse, New York aired a censored version of the previous day's show, while The Howard Stern Show was on its Christmas vacation, the first time the pair was heard on terrestrial radio since their firing at WNEW. Hughes called it \\"a testing ground for putting us back on terrestrial radio\\", which would not happen again until 2006. On March 14, 2005, the show moved their start and end time back an hour, airing from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. each weekday. On April 2, 2005, XM scrapped the additional charge its subscribers were required to pay to obtain High Voltage, and made the channel part of its standard subscription with access to its XM Radio Online service. For nearly eleven months, Opie and Anthony was the only show on High Voltage. At the end of their live show, the replay of the show from that morning would begin immediately after. In March 2005, the show held \\"auditions\\" for other radio personalities to showcase their programs for the possible addition to the High Voltage line-up. These included The Hill-Man Morning Show from WAAF in Boston, and Loren and Wally, from WROR-FM in Boston. On August 1, 2005, XM announced the addition of personalities Ron Bennington and Fez Whatley to host their Ron and Fez show of WJFK in Washington, D.C. on the service. The pair had previously worked with Hughes and Cumia at WNEW and the four remained good friends. Ron and Fez premiered on September 12, 2005 from noon to 3:00 p.m., airing each weekday after Opie and Anthony. Starting in November 2005, the channel had been a part of the DirecTV Total Choice Plus package on channel 879. XM had rated the channel \\"TV-MA-L\\" for DirecTV listings. However, shortly after Opie and Anthony returned to FM radio, DirecTV decided to remove the channel from their service, claiming they wanted to go \\"all music.\\" Thanks to a series of listener complaints, DirecTV eventually restored High Voltage to its lineup. In honor of Jim Norton's birthday, on July 19, 2006, the channel was renamed xL Jimmy Day, and on the new line of XM2gos that included color displays, Jim Norton's face was put on the display. =2006‚Äì2011: the ViRUS= High Voltage was rebranded as the ViRUS on November 20, 2006 and remained on channel 202. The name is derived from the Opie and Anthony slogan 'Spread the Virus', a reference to viral marketing. The launch featured a new channel logo as well as exposure on packaging of XM Radio products. In addition, some extra spots on the weekend were dedicated to new weekly shows, such as the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour, and the Saturday Night Virus. The latter is a weekly rotating slot featuring comedians and friends of the show. Weekend programs were not restricted to Saturday nights though, as The Cosmic Circus aired during a Ron and Fez weekend afternoon replay. Sometimes, the Saturday Night Virus includes a second show, running it to 3:00 in the morning. On October 13, 2011, it was announced that the channel was renamed \\"The Opie & Anthony Channel\\". Opie and Anthony suspension In May 2007, an Opie and Anthony audio byte appeared on the website Breitbart.tv, which had a clip of their show featuring a homeless man talking about how he would sexually abuse Condoleezza Rice, and the Queen of the United Kingdom. This clip soon made its way to the Drudge Report, and gained a lot of attention through news media outlets, as this was following the firings of CBS Radio peers Don Imus, and JV & Elvis. Opie and Anthony were not allowed to discuss the situation on the air, and continued their show. On May 15, 2007, Opie and Anthony were suspended for 30 days for comments made on the previous days broadcast. The show could no longer be heard on XM, but it was still heard on the terrestrial outlets. The ViRUS turned into Ron and Fez every hour, every day, and the weekend programs were also suspended. The fans of the show were angered by this decision, and were calling XM to complain or cancel their subscriptions. Weeks later, XM began hyping up Opie and Anthony's return, and even abandoned the embargo on the show to run worst-of CBS show blocks four days before the live show returned. The show returned on time as promised, on June 15, 2007. On September 23, 2007, the ViRUS added Unmasked to the weekend lineup. The show is hosted by Ron Bennington of Ron and Fez, as he interviews a comedian in front of an audience of their fans. The show runs every other Sunday at 2 p.m. ET, which will be an encore of the show's real premiere on XM Comedy Saturdays. Following the Sirius / XM merger, the ViRUS was added to Sirius on September 30, 2008, as part of its \\"Best of XM\\" package and broadcasts on channel 206. On November 12, 2008, the ViRUS was removed from the DirecTV lineup. =2011‚Äì2014: The Opie & Anthony Channel= On October 13, 2011, it was announced that the channel was no longer the ViRUS, and was renamed to the Opie & Anthony channel. =2014: SiriusXM Talk= In July 2014, Cumia was fired by SiriusXM.

The latter airs from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m., with The Opie Radio Show airing from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. On Opie's first show, Cumia called in to the show, marking the first time the two had talked to each other in two years. =2017‚Äìpresent: Faction Talk= On January 23, 2017, the channel was renamed Faction Talk. The decision was made following the addition of The Jason Ellis Show from the Faction channel to the weekday line-up from 11:00 a.m. In May 2017, the channel was no longer a premium and comedian Nick Di Paolo began his radio show from 6:00‚Äì8:00 p.m. weekdays, followed by The Covino & Rich Show live from Los Angeles until midnight. In the following month, Hughes was fired for allegedly filming an employee using the bathroom. Following the departure of The Opie Radio Show, the channel lineup was revamped. Jim Norton & Sam Roberts remained at 8:00-11:00am, The Covino & Rich Show moved to 11:00am‚Äì2:00pm, The Jason Ellis Show moved to 2:00-6:00pm, and The Craig Ferguson Show moved to the channel from 6:00-8:00pm, with The Nick Di Paolo Show airing from 8:00-10:00pm. In April 2018, Nick Di Paolo was fired from Sirius XM due to a Tweet that management deemed offensive. The Bennington show joined the channel in July 2018, taking the 2:00-5:00pm slot. Later in 2018, the lineup was again revamped, adding an hour to Jim Norton & Sam Roberts, airing from 7:00-11:00am ET, The Covino & Rich Show from 11:00am‚Äì2:00pm, Bennington from 2:00-5:00pm, and The Jason Ellis Show from 5:00-8:00pm.

He is present in the earliest ballads along with Little John and Much the Miller's Son. The confusion of surnames has led some authors to distinguish them as belonging to different characters. The Elizabethan playwright Anthony Munday featured Scarlet and Scathlocke as half-brothers in his play The Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntington. Howard Pyle included both a Will Scathelock and a Will Scarlet in his Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. Will Stutely may also exist as a separate character because of a mistaken surname. Ballads The first appearance of Will Scarlet was in one of the oldest surviving Robin Hood ballads, A Gest of Robyn Hode. He helps capture Richard at the Lee and when Robin lends that knight money to pay off his debts, Scarlet stands laughing at Little John for the cost of clothing the knight (Richard at the Lee) being nothing. (Child Ballad 117A p,74) But after the knight has received four hundred pounds, 3 yards of every coloured cloth, a horse and saddle Will Scarlet insists the knight should have a pair of boots.(Child Ballad 117A p,77) Another very early ballad featuring Will Scarlet is one variant of Robin Hood's Death, in which Will's only role is to urge a bodyguard, which Robin scorns. A later ballad, Robin Hood and the Newly Revived, ascribes an origin story to him. Robin finds a finely dressed young man shooting deer in Sherwood, and offers to let him join the band; they quarrel and fight. Robin asks who he is; he says he is Young Gamwell, who killed his father's steward and fled his father's estate to seek out his uncle, Robin Hood. Robin makes him welcome and renames him Scarlet. This story, more or less, is the common origin story for Will Scarlet, although variations occur. Francis Child indexed those tales: A Gest of Robyn Hode as Child Ballad 117, Robin Hood's Death as Child ballad 120, and Robin Hood Newly Revived as Child ballad 128. He also listed several other ballads featuring Will Scarlet, sometimes in a very minor role. In Robin Hood's Delight (Child Ballad 136), the common story in which Robin meets a stranger, cannot outfight him, and must outwit him is altered: Robin has Little John and Will with him, and they meet three foresters, resulting in the usual fight and outwitting. In Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar (Child Ballad 123), Will Scarlet tells Robin of the friar, resulting in their encounter. In Robin Hood and Guy of Gisbourne (Child Ballad 118), Little John is captured coming to Will's rescue after two of their band had been killed and Will was fleeing. In an unusual Robin Hood ballad Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon (Child ballad 129), Robin, Little John, and Will Scarlet come to the king's rescue, fighting the prince of the title and two giants, and ending with Will marrying the princess; this ballad, unlike the other Child ballads, is seldom used in later adaptations. Later versions Traditionally, when the outlaws are depicted as being middle-aged, Scarlet is often depicted as young or youthful, sometimes in his late teens. In the traditional tales, he is hot-headed and tempestuous, but has a love of fine elegant clothes and is often seen wearing red silk. He is the most skilled swordsman of the merry men whilst Robin Hood is the most skilled archer and Little John the most skilled staff wielder. In some tales, Scarlet uses two swords at the same time (this was parodied in the movie Robin Hood: Men in Tights). According to local tradition, Will Scarlet was killed after a battle with the Sheriff's men and is buried in the churchyard of the Church of St. Mary of the Purification, Blidworth in Nottinghamshire. The apex of the old church spire stands in the graveyard and is popularly referred to as a monument to Will Scarlet, whose grave is otherwise unmarked. Other depictions *In both the 1938 film, starring Errol Flynn, and 1991 TV movie, Will Scarlet is portrayed as Robin's friend and companion (almost a squire) from the beginning, and is a witty, humorous character. In the 1938 film, his given name is \\"Will o' Gamwell\\". This character, played by English actor Patric Knowles, is also merged with Alan-a-Dale, as Will plays the lute in one scene. In the 2006 BBC TV series, the same role is given to the character named Much. *In the classic 1950s series of The Adventures of Robin Hood, the character was played by Ronald Howard and later by Paul Eddington. When they first met he and Robin Hood get into a fight with each other before Scarlet escapes from the Sheriff's men. He was initially depicted as a bearded yet youthful gentleman. Fun-loving, adventurous and a roguish womanising boaster. He was however also a loyal and experienced swordsman. This version of Will's real name was Will O'Winchester. In the first two episodes, a cynical Will Scathelock is the original leader of the Sherwood outlaws. On his death bed, Scathelock tells the outlaws to follow Robin Hood. *In the UK TV series Robin of Sherwood (1984‚Äì1986), Ray Winstone portrays a very different version of Will Scarlet. Rather than the stereotypical merry sidekick, this interpretation gave us a much bleaker, more passionate character. An ex- soldier who fought in France, he is shown as the most violent of the outlaws, having turned to murder after powerlessly witnessing the brutalisation and trampling to death of his wife at the hands of Normans. With a burning hatred of the Sheriff of Nottingham's men ‚Äì and a lack of respect for all authority ‚Äì he tells Robin he has changed his name from Scathelocke to Scarlet having killed three men in revenge. *In the anime series Robin Hood no Daib≈çken, Will Scarlet (voiced by Yuko Mita) is Robin's cousin who fights along his side when trouble arises and has two sisters; a sister named Winifred Scarlet (voiced by: Maria Kawamura) and a younger sister named Jenny Scarlet (Barbara in the Japanese version) (Voiced by: Sayuri Iketmoto) who travel with them and help out. *In the animated series Young Robin Hood, Will Scarlet (voiced by Sonja Ball) is a young and talented thief who idolises Robin. He is also a technical talent and creates a variety of traps and machines to aid the Merry Men. *The ninety-fourth episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Qpid, the character of Worf (portrayed by Michael Dorn) plays the role of Scarlet after the crew of the Enterprise are transformed into characters of Robin Hood by Q. *In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Christian Slater plays Will Scarlet, whom the film depicts as the illegitimate half-brother of Robin Hood (many older traditions make him a kinsman of Robin's, usually a cousin or nephew) Robin's father did not acknowledge Scarlet and instead doted on Robin, leading Scarlet to become resentful of Robin. He initially appears as a treacherous character, but later finds redemption when he helps the Merry Men rescue Maid Marian and several others from the Sheriff of Nottingham. *In the Mel Brooks movie Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Will is shown as Little John's best friend. His full name is Will Scarlet O'Hara; he's from Georgia. Played by Matthew Porretta. *In the 2002 video game Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, Will Scarlet is shown as Robin's troublesome nephew that rebels against the sheriff constantly and as a result of this is put in prison. He is later rescued by Robin Hood and added to the band of merry men. He is shown to be extremely violent, with the ability to strangle enemies from behind or finish them off when they are down and it is implied that he wears red so no one can see the blood stains. *In the BBC 2006 series Robin Hood, Will Scarlet, portrayed by Harry Lloyd, is an eighteen-year-old carpenter whom Robin saves from hanging. He is a brooding, quiet character who is often one of the most sensible and moral of Robin's band of men. The youngest of Robin's men, Will fights skilfully with two axes. In this series, Will appears to be best friends with Alan-a-Dale (Joe Armstrong) although this is put in doubt when Alan is unmasked as a traitor and admits to love Djaq (played by Anjali Jay). *In Princess of Thieves, Will Scarlet (portrayed by Crispin Letts) is said to be Robin Hood's loyal friend and companion, as well as his brother (Robin's daughter Gwyn refers to Will as \\"Uncle\\"). *In the 2010 film Robin Hood, directed by Ridley Scott, Will Scarlet is portrayed by actor Scott Grimes and is a Welsh Archer serving alongside Robin and Allan A'Dayle. *In a 2010 children's book \\"The Time Hunters\\", Will Scarlet appeared as a main character and was living with a time traveller in modern-day Addlebury in northwest England. He was portrayed as a noble man and skilful archer, but sensitive about the popularity of the fictitious Robin Hood. *In a 2012 novel by A. C. Gaughen, Scarlet is a young former daughter of a noble, dressing in drag. She is a knife thrower, and has a pronounced scar beneath one eye. *In 2013, Once Upon a Time spin-off Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, mostly based on Alice in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, revealed in its third episode, Forget Me Not, that one of its main characters was not only the Knave of Hearts from the popular children's tale, Alice in Wonderland, but also Will Scarlet. In the series finale it was revealed that Will became the White King from Through the Looking-Glass. He is portrayed by English actor Michael Socha. In 2014, Michael Socha returned to the role as a main cast member in Once Upon a Time in Wonderlands parent series, Once Upon a Time. His appearance in the show's fourth season takes place after Wonderland, with him ending up in Storybrooke, Maine due to Snow White's curse. Here, he begrudgingly reunites with Robin Hood, until Robin is forced to leave Storybrooke with Maid Marian to save her from the Snow Queen's curse. He later engages in a short-lived dating relationship with Belle. *Jamie Dornan portrayed a much more villainous version of Will \\"Scarlet\\" Tillman in the 2018 film Robin Hood. Will initially is the leader of the commoners of Nottingham and Marian's lover. During the final battle, Will is scarred by an explosion after seeing Marian and Robin kiss. Bitter over the betrayal, Will becomes the new Sheriff of Nottingham.

Smith was born in the state of New York, where he attended Hamilton College. In June 1862, during the American Civil War, he enlisted in Company K, 7th U.S. Infantry Regiment. He became a lieutenant in the 117th New York Volunteer Infantry until October 1863 when he was assigned to Maj. Gen. Alfred Terry as an aide-de-camp. He was severely wounded at Fort Fisher in January 1865. He was later breveted to major for his actions in the war. After the war, in 1867, Smith joined the 7th U.S. Cavalry under George Armstrong Custer. He soon became friends with Custer, and was part of the so-called \\"Custer Clan\\" or \\"Custer Gang\\" of close-knit friends and relatives of the general. Custer called him \\"Fresh\\" Smith, the opposite of \\"Salty\\" Smith. He married Nettie B. Bowen on October 10, 1867, at her home in Newport, New York. Smith served in the 1868 Washita Campaign, seeing his first action against the Native Americans. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on December 5, 1868. He participated in most the 7th Cavalry's campaigns, including the 1873 Yellowstone campaign and as assistant quartermaster in the 1874 Black Hills expedition. Although the 1st lieutenant of Company A, Smith was named as assigned to command Company E. This was under the command of first lieutenant Charles DeRudio as its nominal commander, Captain Charles S. Ilsley, was permanent aide-de-camp to General John Pope at Fort Leavenworth. These changes were to result in Smith being killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn and DeRudio surviving. Smith's body was not found among his men, but instead was discovered with Custer in the small knot of dead troops on \\"Last Stand Hill.\\" Smith was given a hasty burial on the battlefield. He was re- interred in 1877 in the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His widow died in 1903.

(KAS; Konrad Adenauer Foundation) is a German political party foundation associated with but independent of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The foundation's headquarters are located in Sankt Augustin near Bonn and Berlin. Globally, the KAS has 78 offices and runs programs in over 100 countries. Its current chairman is the former President of the German parliament Deutscher Bundestag, Norbert Lammert. It is a member of the Centre for European Studies, the official foundation and think tank of the European People's Party (EPP). Establishment and mission Image from the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung The establishment of a ‚Äúsystematic civic-education program inspired by Christian democratic values‚Äù began being considered in 1952 by a group of CDU politicians including Bundestag president Hermann Ehlers, Robert Tillmanns, and Heinrich Krone. On 20 December 1955 The Society for Christian Democratic Education, which would be renamed after Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1964, was opened in Bonn.http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.3716/ Official Website: History The aim of the foundation's civic education programs is, according to their official website, the ‚Äúpromotion of freedom and liberty, peace, and justice‚Äù through ‚Äúfurthering European unification, improving transatlantic relations, and deepening development cooperation‚Äù. Their function as a think-tank and consulting agency is intended to provide citizens with a basis for political action through the research and analyses of current political trends. The KAS offers more than 2,500 conferences and events each year worldwide, and actively supports the political involvement and education of intellectually gifted youth through a prestigious scholarship program as well as an ongoing comprehensive seminar program. Institution Along with the headquarters in Sankt Augustin and Berlin, the KAS operates two educational centers, sixteen training centers, an Academy, and an international conference center. The KAS consists of six departments: * The aforementioned Academy located in Berlin, which hosts symposia, conferences, meetings, and exhibitions in order to analyze relevant societal and political issues in a public setting. * The Archive for Christian Democratic Policy (ACDP) documents and researches Christian Democracy‚Äôs historical development. * The department for European and International Cooperation engages itself with international politics through the functions of the foundation's more than 200 projects in around 120 countries. * The Politics and Consulting department is the think tank of the KAS. * The department for Civic Education combats the status quo, looking to invoke citizen participation in an era where freedom and peace are taken for granted. * The Scholarships and Cultural Activities department provides financial and moral support to roughly 2,000 students. Former President of the Bundestag Norbert Lammert is the current President of the KAS. He is joined on the Board of Directors by 24 other individuals. The KAS currently has 55 members, many of whom are current and former CDU politicians. The Board of Trustees has 24 members who assist and supervise the work of the KAS. Finances Similar to other German political foundations, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation is largely financed by federal and land government funds. 96.8% of the foundation's ‚Ç¨120 million budget in 2009 was therefore provided by public funding, while 2.7% was derived from admission charges and miscellaneous revenues, and 0.5% came from private funds and donations. Prizes The Konrad Adenauer Foundation awards a prize for young scholars, named after the CDU politician Bruno Heck, a prize for local journalists and a literature prize. Cooperation with other foundations and organizations In Bavaria, the Hanns Seidel Foundation operates in lieu of the Konrad-Adenauer Foundation; in Schleswig-Holstein, the Hermann-Ehlers-Foundation assumes the Adenauer Foundation's role. These two CDU-friendly foundations are not the Adenauer Foundation's only collaborators; for instance, the Adenauer Foundation co-published a study with the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Market Economy Foundation, and the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation titled \\"Educational Policy in a Federal System and International Influences\\", in which it injected itself into the dialogue on educational policy and examined various influences. Furthermore, the Adenauer Foundation authored a \\"Common Declaration\\" in partnership with the Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation, the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, the Hans-Seidel-Foundation, and the Heinrich- Boell-Foundation which explored various mission statements and financing models of political foundations in Germany. The KAS is a member of \\"European Movement Germany\\". As a member of the market-oriented Stockholm Network, the KAS cooperates with other foundations and think tanks in issues pertaining to European politics. Former Scholars Former scholars of the foundation have been Thomas de Maizi√®re, Peter Altmaier, Christian Wulff, Uwe Barschel, Tom Enders, Stefan Hell, Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz, Detlef Seif, and Ruprecht Polenz.

Luke was played by Tom Wopat. Luke and his younger cousin Bo Duke live in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, in Georgia. Luke and Bo own a 1969 Dodge Charger, nicknamed The General Lee, which is painted orange, with the Confederate Flag on top, and 01 painted on the sides. Luke and Bo evade the corrupt politicians of Hazzard County, such as Boss Hogg, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, and the sheriff's deputies. The Duke family, including cousin Daisy Duke and Uncle Jesse Duke, was well known for their role in the moonshine business among other interests. Bo and Luke had both been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine. As a result, neither was permitted to use firearms, instead preferring to use bow and arrows. The terms of Bo and Luke's probation included staying within the boundaries of Hazzard County (unless given special permission by their Probation Officer, who happened to be Boss Hogg). Prior to the start of the show, Luke served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Luke's famous \\"hood slide\\" (as seen in the opening credits, originating from the second episode, \\"Daisy's Song\\") is the trick most commonly associated with the character. In a subsequent TV interview, Tom Wopat admitted that the move was actually a mistake; it originated when he was trying to vault over the car to get to the passenger side and his foot accidentally caught the edge of the hood, causing his leg to slide across it. The move eventually caught on and became the character's hallmark. Additionally, in this initial slide, Wopat caught his hand on the hood radio aerial, leading to the aerial being removed from all later examples of the car to avoid risk of injury. In the pilot episode of the series, Bo commented that Luke was probably the father of at least two of the children who live at the Hazzard County Orphanage. Luke later left Hazzard County, along with his cousin Bo, to join the NASCAR circuit. His cousin Vance replaced him during that time. According to the 1997 film The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!, Luke eventually would leave Hazzard for good, and put his military training to good use by becoming a fire jumper for the U.S. Forest Service. During training in Montana, he met and fell in love with a woman named Anita Blackwell, who was a talented singer. He convinced her to leave to pursue her dreams, and she became a successful country music star. Luke met her again in The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood, although by then she was married to another man. Luke Duke was later played by Johnny Knoxville in the subsequent cinematic version and Randy Wayne in the prequel television film, The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning.

In the series, Rukia is a Soul Reaper, (Ê≠ªÁ•û, Shinigami, literally 'Death God'), in charge of slaying evil spirits known as Hollows. At the beginning, after a brief meeting with the protagonist of the series, Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see supernatural beings such as Soul Reapers, she is forced to give him her powers in order to fulfill her duties as a Soul Reaper. Rukia has appeared in several other pieces of Bleach media, including the four featured films in the series, the two original video animations and several video games. Rukia was the first character of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use for all the other Soul Reapers. Reaction to her character is generally positive. Her differences from typical sh≈çnen heroines is praised, as is her interaction with other characters. Additionally, she usually ranks second in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump's Bleach popularity polls, and is consistently the most popular female character in those polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Rukia's likeness, including a plush doll and several figurines. Creation and conception Bleach was first conceived from Tite Kubo's desire to draw a shinigami in a kimono, which formed the basis for the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki was one of the first characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist, with Rukia being the first female lead. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl. As for her name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki \\"looks like a shinigami\\", he wanted her name to sound like something a shinigami would have as a name. When deciding upon her family name he considered using because it sounded like a name a shinigami would have, and then decided to use . He adds that he once heard something that sounded like \\"Kuchiki Rukia\\" on Japanese television, and liked it enough to use it as a name. Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means \\"light\\" and Kubo sees her as \\"a ray of light for Ichigo.\\" Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakut≈ç, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series. When Kubo was asked to make a cover with a female character during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable for such role. Additionally, after the second anime season/manga arc, Orihime replaced Rukia as the true female lead for the rest of the series. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to see the image. In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such as when she is going to be executed in the manga.  Appearances  =In Bleach= Rukia meets Ichigo in the midst of a hollow attack. After suffering her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kid≈ç spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kid≈ç for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety. During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as an infant and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana initially tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia. As Rukia grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family. One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her. When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him. During the course of a mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him. Rukia using the \\"first dance, white moon\\" ability of Sode no Shirayuki's shikai. During Rukia's bid for freedom, she is stopped by S≈çsuke Aizen and his accomplices. Aizen, having singlehandedly orchestrated Rukia's execution, reveals to her that within her soul is stored the H≈çgyoku (\\"breakdown sphere\\"), a powerful artifact created and placed there by Kisuke Urahara that gives hollows Soul Reaper powers and vice versa. Wanting the H≈çgyoku for himself, Aizen hoped that her death would give him access to it, but settles for a nonfatal alternative. The H≈çgyoku is removed from her body, Aizen and his men flee Soul Society, and Rukia is acquitted of all charges. With the H≈çgyoku, Aizen is able to create an army of arrancar, which he uses to attack Ichigo and his friends once they return to the human world. Rukia and a group of other Soul Reapers are sent to assist in fighting the arrancar, though after Aizen captures Orihime Inoue they are recalled to Soul Society. Rukia's zanpakut≈ç, , is also revealed as a completely white blade, earning it the recognition as the most beautiful zanpakut≈ç in Soul Society. Sode no Shirayuki utilizes ice to attack, each of its abilities being labeled as \\"dances\\" by Rukia. During the anime's 13th season, Sode no Shirayuki manifests in a yukionna-like form, voiced by Mie Sonozaki. After learning that Aizen kidnapped Orihime, Rukia and friends head for Hueco Mundo to rescue her. While there, Rukia encounters the Espada, Aaroniero Arruruerie, who is revealed to have possession of Kaien's body. Saddened that she had not saved her mentor from the control of a hollow as she had previously thought, Rukia manages to kill Aaroniero. Rukia is badly injured during the battle, and it is not until Soul Society sends reinforcements to Hueco Mundo that she is revived and her wounds are healed. She later assists Ichigo in his rescue to save Orihime from the Espada Ulquiorra Cifer by engaging the remaining Arrancars until requiring support. Following Aizen's defeat and the loss of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers, Rukia and Ichigo bid one another farewell as Ichigo loses the ability to sense Rukia's presence. Seventeen months later, Rukia, now lieutenant of Squad 13, returns to aid in restoring Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers before engaging the Fullbringer Riruka Dokugamine. When the Soul Society is abruptly invaded by the Wandenreich, an organization made up of Quincy who has survived their genocide one thousand years before, Rukia senses Byakuya being left near dead by √Ñs Nodt and is knocked out before she can come to her brother's aid. Rukia is taken to the Royal Dimension so she could be healed, and is then taught by Ichibei Hyosube to achieve her bankai, . Returning to the Soul Society when the Wandenreich resume their attack, Rukia utilizes her newly acquired bankai to finally kill √Ñs Nodt. In the subsequent battles against Yhwach's Schutzstaffel Rukia and a large number of high rank Soul Reapers are quickly defeated by the powerful Gerard Valkyrie. In the series epilogue, ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Rukia is revealed to have become the new Squad 13 captain and married Renji with the two having a daughter named Ichika. =In other media= Rukia has made several appearances outside of the Bleach anime and manga. She appears in all of the featured films in the series: she fights the Dark Ones with other Soul Reaper comrades in Bleach: Memories of Nobody and aids in the search for T≈çshir≈ç Hitsugaya in Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion. Rukia is also given the main focus role in the third movie, Bleach: Fade to Black where she is kidnapped and mind-wiped by two mysterious rogues, and later transformed into 'Dark Rukia'. In the fourth movie, Bleach: Hell Verse, Rukia helps Ichigo in rescuing his sister Yuzu from the depths of Hell. She is also present in both of the original video animations produced in the series, helping Ichigo in Memories in the Rain and combating the rogue Soul Reaper Baishin in The Sealed Sword Frenzy. In Rock Musical Bleach, a musical based on the Bleach series, she is played by Miki Sat≈ç. In the Bleach video games, Rukia is a playable character in every game, including the Heat the Soul and Blade Battlers series. In some games, her human form and Soul Reaper state are available as separate characters, while Dark Rukia is playable in Heat the Soul 6 and Heat the Soul 7. Rukia is featured in the live-action adaptation of the manga, Bleach. The character was portrayed by Hana Sugisaki and the film took place during the Soul Reaper Agent arc, when Rukia had to transfer her powers to Ichigo. The film opened in Japan on July 20, 2018. Reception Rukia has ranked highly in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump popularity polls for the series, placing in the top five most popular characters in all four polls. She was ranked as the second most popular character after Ichigo in the first two polls, and fell to third place in the third poll, being replaced by T≈çshir≈ç Hitsugaya. In early 2008, she was voted the second most popular character in Bleach, receiving 383 votes less than the front runner, T≈çshir≈ç Hitsugaya. Her zanpakut≈ç, Sode no Shirayuki, ranked 2nd in the zanpakut≈ç popularity poll of the series. In 2009, Rukia ranked 4th in a survey of the Japanese music distributor Recochoku titled \\"The Character I Want to Be My Bride\\". In a 2007 character poll from the Japanese magazine Newtype magazine character polls, Rukia has been featured as one of the most popular female characters from any anime. She has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular female anime characters. NTT customers voted her as their eighth favorite black haired female anime character. Fumiko Orikasa, Rukia's Japanese voice actor. Merchandise based on Rukia's appearance has been released, including a key chain, a plush doll, and a figurine. Fumiko Orikasa, Rukia's Japanese voice actor, liked how Rukia was developed while fighting against the arrancar, noting her to be a hero during her introductions. However, she was saddened by how after Rukia defeats the first arrancar,(Di Roy Rinker) she is instantly stabbed by the arrancar Grimmjow. Michelle Ruff, Rukia's English voice actress, found Rukia to be a \\"survivor\\", due to how lonely she initially was and how she has been developed through the anime series as she had to start trusting people. She also liked how cool Rukia is when she is fighting but noted it challenging how to voice Rukia due to her various attitudes. Ruff was the winner in the category \\"Best Voice Actress (English)\\" from the 2009 SPJA Industry Awards for her work as Rukia. Rukia also won in the category \\"Best Female Character\\" based on her appearances on Bleach: Memories of Nobody. Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Rukia's character. Although Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment noted Rukia's introduction in Bleach was typical in several others series, he praised how she interacted with her schoolmates and Ichigo. Anime News Network's (ANN) Melissa Harper praised the differences between Rukia and stereotypical sh≈çnen heroines, asserting that Rukia's loss of her powers and subsequent dependence on Ichigo were \\"a great source of both drama and comedy in the show.\\" However, the removal of the humor from Rukia's scenes as a schoolgirl due to the English translation was lamented, although Ruff was extolled for doing an \\"excellent job.\\" Carlos Alexandre from popcultureshock.com regarded her as \\"less of a foil to Ichigo and more like the other side of the same coin\\". Her actions and words were also commented by Alexendre to make Rukia deserve the respect she commands. IGN called the scene where Rukia is forced to leave Ichigo Kurosaki and return to Soul Society as \\"touchingly beautiful\\" and celebrated Rukia's character development during her time in the human world. Her subsequent appearances in Soul Society were criticized by ANN's Theron Martin due to her lack of activity making them \\"irritating given how strong a character she was in the series' early going\\". In his review of the live action film, Rob Hunter from the Film School Rejects criticised the narrative of the story, especially when the female lead character, Rukia played by Hana Sugisaki, had to be reduced into a supporting- type character for the male lead character, Ichigo played by Sota Fukushi. He further praised Sugisaki's performances and lamented the fact that the actress was given weak materials for the film.

The identifier consists of two parts, a prefix ‚Äòosgb‚Äô and a unique identifier that is 13-16 digits long. In GML 2, a TOID is encoded as a gml:fid (Feature Identifier); in GML 3 as a gml:id. Around 440 million man-made and natural features have been thus identified: buildings, roads, fields, phone boxes, pillar boxes, landmarks and many other types. The identification system is designed to be used in GIS, digital cartography and in any customized computer application, including non-cartographic ones, where information about fixed, real-world features needs to be managed. Using consistent identifiers (IDs) makes it much easier to share data between various kinds of applications and systems. A TOID remains constant throughout the lifetime of the real-world feature it identifies, and is guaranteed not to be reassigned to anything else when the feature no longer exists. Example: the TOID for the Tower of London is osgb1000006032892. TOIDs in OS MasterMap OS MasterMap, Ordnance Survey's master database, depends on TOIDs. Every feature is identified by a TOID in MasterMap. Other attributes of the feature are defined by relating them, via GML, to the TOID. Users of OS MasterMap relate their own data to TOIDs of items of interest to them. Unlike with a custom designed GIS, one organization can share data with another organization easily since TOIDs are maintained centrally by Ordnance Survey, and are free to reuse. TOID revision history If the data for a feature is edited, for example to reflect a real-life change or to correct an error, then the changes are referenced by TOID. Unless the feature has undergone drastic change, the feature keeps its original TOID, enabling one to track changes to a feature over time if one has access to the historic data. Granularity of TOIDs Every object in OS MasterMap has its own TOID, including features representing buildings, roads, addresses, and cartographic text. Complex entities such as Southampton Central railway station, are defined in terms of multiple TOIDs: one for the main building, several others for the platforms, and another for the pedestrian bridge over the tracks. The OS MasterMap Sites Layer has a single TOID for these 'sites'. Similarly, users can create their own \\"supertoid\\" that unites features into one entity. This also acknowledges that defining the boundaries of vaguely defined folk objects is subjective: should the station car-park be defined as part of the station, for example? The TOID scheme leaves such decisions to its users, that is, those building information systems for end- users. Intellectual Property In keeping with recent Open Data initiatives, Ordnance Survey has stated its policy on royalty free use of the TOID with the aim of allowing easier integration of data using its spatial database: a core part of its vision of a Digital National Framework. \\"TOID\\" is a registered trademark of Ordnance Survey.

It is part of the hepatic portal system. Structure The splenic vein is formed from small venules that leave the spleen. It travels above the pancreas, alongside the splenic artery. It collects branches from the stomach and pancreas, and most notably from the large intestine (also drained by the superior mesenteric vein) via the inferior mesenteric vein, which drains in the splenic vein shortly before the origin of the hepatic portal vein. The splenic vein ends in the portal vein, formed when the splenic vein joins the superior mesenteric vein. Clinical significance The splenic vein can be affected by thrombosis, presenting some of the characteristics of portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension, but localized to part of the territory drained by the splenic vein. These include varices in the stomach wall due to hypertension in the short gastric veins and abdominal pain. This results in gastric varices, in which the treatment of choice would be splenectomy.

It was launched in November 2001. It is a database that records every fixed feature of Great Britain larger than a few metres in one continuous digital map. Every feature is given a unique TOID (TOpographical IDentifier), a simple identifier that includes no semantic information. Typically each TOID is associated with a polygon that represents the area on the ground that the feature covers, in National Grid coordinates. OS MasterMap is offered in themed \\"layers\\", for example a road layer and a building layer, each linked to a number of TOIDs. Pricing of licenses to OS MasterMap data depends on: the total area requested, the layers licensed, the number of TOIDs in the layers, the period in years of the data usage. OS MasterMap can be used to generate maps for a vast array of purposes. Although the scale on a digital map is much more flexible than a paper map, one can print out maps from OS MasterMap data with detail equivalent to a traditional 1:1250 paper map. Ordnance Survey claims that OS MasterMap data is never more than six months out of date, thanks to continuous review. The scale and detail of this mapping project is so far unique. Around 440 million TOIDs have so far been assigned, and the database stands at 600 gigabytes in size. Ordnance Survey is encouraging users of its old Land-Line data to migrate to OS MasterMap.

Recently, Ordnance Survey has been trialing delivery of OS MasterMap data using WFS and WMS, in accordance with the Open Geospatial Consortium. This trial may even end up with automatic updates using WFS-T. Ordnance Survey MasterMap is distributed through a number of 3rd party data companies such as the Joanna James Map Portal. Custodianship of the data Although branded like a commercial product, OS MasterMap is in fact the UK‚Äôs most complete, accurate and up-to-date geographic record. By moving to purely digital media for mapping, Ordnance Survey brings upon itself the responsibility of being the sole mandatory custodian of Great Britain's official maps. Previously, by virtue of being a publication on paper, a copy of every edition of every paper map published by Ordnance Survey would have been deposited, by law, with each of the six legal deposit libraries in the UK. Although there is no such law in place for digital maps, the Ordnance Survey makes annual 'snapshots' of the data and voluntarily deposits with the legal deposit libraries: The data, like any other, is susceptible to all the problems of computer data storage and digital preservation, for example: data corruption; the question of how often to take snapshots of the data (i.e. should every edit be recorded?); access to old versions of the data; practicable access to old versions of the data (after format changes, will new software be able to read old data?).

Currie Barracks Currie Barracks, 1948 The Canadian Army opened what was called the Currie Barracks on the southwestern edge of Calgary in 1933, occupying a property on the level plateau above the south slope of the Bow River valley. The facility was named after the recently deceased General Sir Arthur William Currie, commander of the Canadian Expeditionary Force on the Western Front during World War I. Over the next decade, the facility would house a combination of personnel from the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps and Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, along with personnel from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). During the Second World War a triangular air strip was constructed on the property, south of the Barracks. Two British Commonwealth Air Training Plan stations operated out of the facility: No. 3 Service Flying Training School, with seven hangars on the north end of the strip, and No. 10 Repair Depot, with eleven hangars on the south end of the strip. The air strip was officially closed in 1964, and was removed several years later. During World War II, the Currie Barracks became an army training centre for units mobilized in southern Alberta; it was designated A-16. These mobilized units were tasked to provide reinforcements for The Calgary Highlanders and The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Following the war in 1946, the Currie Barracks became home to Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) and 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry as part of Canada's transition to having an expanded regular force army during the early years of the Cold War. The Currie Barracks underwent rapid expansion during the Korean War as the facility transformed into a major military centre, owing to its convenient access to the Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental mainline to Vancouver three kilometres to the north. Headquarters Calgary Garrison was formed on October 26, 1950 in response to the need to coordinate the administration of army units stationed at and cycling through the Currie Barracks; thus the facility also began to use the names Calgary Garrison and Calgary Barracks. Harvey Barracks Harvey Barracks, 1964 In 1910 the Canadian military established Camp Sarcee on a piece of land expropriated from the Tsuu T'ina First Nation at the southwest corner of Calgary. Throughout the First World War the camp served as the training place for the 10th and 50th Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Following the Second World War the camp was re-established as Sarcee Barracks, being constructed during 1957 and opening in 1958. The new base contained a parade square, firing range, ropes course, school, housing, running track, and garages. In 1968 Sarcee Barracks was united with Currie Barracks to form CFB Calgary, and in 1981 the base was renamed \\"Harvey Barracks\\" after Frederick Harvey. The base closed in June 1997. CFB Calgary's units, past and present The pending unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force to form the Canadian Forces on February 1, 1968, precipitated a number of major changes to Canada's military. As a result, the Currie Barracks were redesignated Canadian Forces Base Calgary (CFB Calgary) on March 14, 1966. As a former Canadian Army facility, the newly designated CFB Calgary fell under Force Mobile Command, the new command for Canada's land forces. Camp Wainwright at Denwood, Alberta, became a satellite auxiliary training camp under the jurisdiction of CFB Calgary on January 1, 1967, however the facility became a separately controlled base (CFB Wainwright) on August 1 of that year. CFB Calgary was reorganized by Mobile Command on February 20, 1969, when 1 Combat Group was combined with the base itself; both the base and 1 Combat Group reported to a single commander. The base was tasked with providing administrative and support services to units posted to it in support of 1 Combat Group operations. Initial lodger units at CFB Calgary included: * Headquarters, 1 Combat Group * 1st Fort Garry Horse * 1 Signal Squadron * 1st Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry * Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band * Headquarters, 7 Tactical Air Unit (TAU) * 1 Service Battalion (The base was officially closed by the 1 Svc Bn Operations Officer Captain Stewart Campbell CD (Ret'd)) The force structure evolved as the 1st Fort Garry Horse was disbanded in 1970 as the regiment reverted to reserve status. The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and the 1 Military Police Platoon along with Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) were garrisoned at CFB Calgary beginning in the 1960s. In September 1991, the 1 Canadian Brigade Group and CFB Calgary became independent of each other under separate commands and reported to Land Force Western Area. Despite the closure of CFB Calgary in 1998, three Reserve Force units of the Canadian Army remain at the site. These units consist of the Headquarters, 41 Canadian Brigade Group, 41 Service Battalion, and 41 Combat Engineer Regiment. Two corps of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, the 2554 PPCLI RCACC and the 1292 LdsH RCACC, continue to train at the old base. Closure It was announced in the 1996 federal budget that CFB Calgary would be closed in 1998 as part of a policy to close various Canadian Forces bases to consolidate units into fewer facilities. In 1998, CFB Calgary was officially decommissioned, with most of its personnel relocated to CFB Edmonton in Edmonton, Alberta. The base closure offered a rare opportunity for Calgary to experience a comprehensive redevelopment and land use planning strategy for a large continuous property.CFB West Master Plan from the City of Calgary Family residential areas within the base, known as the Currie PMQs (or private married quarters) and located east of Crowchild Trail, were redeveloped under the aegis of the Canada Lands Company as the new community of Garrison Woods.Garrison Woods site in English The redevelopment included the razing of some older or less marketable houses (including semi-detached houses), the upgrading and relocation of other houses, and the construction of single-family houses, townhouses, and condominium complexes. Some commercial buildings (including a Canada Safeway) have also been built in the northwest corner of the former PMQ lands. The redevelopment of Garrison Woods won numerous awards from the residential development community, including the Honour Award for Planning Excellence from the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Grand SAM Award from the Canadian Home Builders' Association.Garrison Woods Awards An article in Maclean's Magazine reported that a large number of houses were first purchased by single women.\\"Canadian Forces Base\\" , Maclean's Magazine, August 11, 2003. Redevelopment of the areas west of Crowchild Trail, including military facilities, a parade ground, and single-person residential housing, began at the same time. Planning for the disposition of the land and its facilities took longer to plan out, and in the meantime warehouses and hangars were converted into offices, theatrical rehearsal spaces, and several buildings were used as studios by movie and television production companies for shows such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show, Legends of the Fall and other projects. In 2004, the base lands hosted the touring company of Cirque du Soleil. It is currently home to Wild Rose Brewery and CrossFit Currie Barracks. Clear Water Academy, a private Catholic school, was established on the former CFB Calgary property and occupied three historic buildings along Dieppe Avenue. The Calgary Farmer's Market was also located west of Crowchild Trail, in an airplane hangar located on former RCAF lands, but has since moved.Calgary Farmer's Market website The Military Museums (formerly known as the Museum of the Regiments) is located east of Crowchild Trail in Garrison Woods. Current plans call for most of the base to be zoned for residential use as part of the Lincoln Park neighbourhood.

By extension, the whole event may be called a roda (as in \\"We will have a roda next Saturday\\"). Likewise, sometimes a roda may not take the shape of a circle; it may be, for example, a half-circle if the event is a public performance, in order for the public to be able to see the performers easily. In English language this dance arrangement is called \\"jamming\\". The people who form the roda will take turns (usually with no predefined order) in going inside the circle. Some of the people in the roda may be mere spectators, in the sense that they will not go inside the circle, but they are usually expected to contribute to the roda by at least clapping and singing. This can be compared to other art forms, such as tap dancing, where participants will form a circle and take turns in performing inside the circle. Part of the etiquette of the roda means that the people in it should try to keep the roda circular and fill in any \\"gaps\\" that may appear if someone leaves the roda; in other words, the people should be evenly distributed in the circumference of the roda, especially if there are not many people in it.

Childress County, Texas, June 1938. The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains mostly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains. The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and to just south of the Texas Panhandle.:File:Level III ecoregions, United States.png The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around to over . Name The term \\"Great Plains\\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States, brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states. Today the term \\"High Plains\\" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains. Geography and climate The High Plains has a \\"cold semi-arid\\" climate‚ÄîK√∂ppen BSk‚Äîreceiving between of precipitation annually. Due to low moisture and high elevation, the High Plains commonly experiences wide ranges and extremes in temperature. The temperature range from day to night is usually 30 ¬∞F (~16.5 ¬∞C), and 24-hour temperature shifts of 100 ¬∞F (~55.5 ¬∞C) are possible, as evidenced by a weather event that occurred in Browning, Montana from 23 January 1916 to 24 January 1916, when the temperature fell from . This is the world record for the greatest temperature change in 24 hours. The region is known for the steady, and sometimes intense, winds that prevail from the west. The winds add a considerable wind chill factor in the winter. The development of wind farms in the High Plains is one of the newest areas of economic development. The High Plains are anomalously high in elevation. An explanation has recently been proposed to explain this high elevation. As the Farallon plate was subducted into the mantle beneath the region, water trapped in hydrous minerals in the descending slab was forced up into the lower crust above. Within the crust this water caused the hydration of dense garnet and other phases into lower density amphibole and mica minerals. The resulting increase in crustal volume raised the elevation about one mile.Why Are the High Plains So High? THECHERRYCREEKNEWS.COM, Mar 15, 2005 (2015?) Flora Typical plant communities of the region are shortgrass prairie, prickly pear cacti and scrub. Sagebrush steppe is also present, particularly in high and dry areas closer to the Rocky Mountains. Economy Agriculture in the forms of cattle ranching and the growing of wheat, corn, and sunflowers is the primary economic activity in the region. The aridity of the region necessitates either dryland farming methods or irrigation; much water for irrigation is drawn from the underlying Ogallala Aquifer, which makes it possible to grow water-intensive crops such as corn, which the region's aridity would otherwise not support. Some areas of the High Plains have significant petroleum and natural gas deposits. The combination of oil, natural gas, and wind energy along with plentiful underground water, has allowed some areas (such as West Texas) to sustain a range of economic activity, including occasional industry. For example, the ASARCO refinery in Amarillo, Texas has been in operation since 1924 due to the plentiful and inexpensive natural gas and water that are needed in metal ore refining. Demographics The High Plains has one of the lowest population densities of any region in the continental United States; Wyoming, for example, has the second lowest population density in the country after Alaska. In contrast to the stagnant population growth in the northern and western High Plains, cities in west Texas have shown sustained growth; Amarillo and Lubbock both have populations near or above 200,000 and continue to grow. Smaller towns, on the other hand, often struggle to sustain their population.

He was killed in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Biography Yates was born in Albany, New York. He met Custer in Monroe, Michigan, and they became close personal friends. During the American Civil War, Yates was a second lieutenant in the 4th Michigan Infantry. Custer helped him secure a position on General Alfred Pleasonton's staff for Yates. Yates earned several brevet promotions in rank for his actions during the war. He fought at the First Battle of Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg. After the Civil War, in 1866, Yates was appointed a captain in the 7th Cavalry. He served under Lt. Colonel Custer, commanding F Company. He was a member of the so-called \\"Custer Clan\\" or \\"Custer Gang\\" of close-knit friends and relatives of the General. Yates was killed during the Battle of the Little Bighorn and fell near Custer. According to some accounts, he is said to have taken command of the battalion after the initial fighting at Medicine Tail Coulee, where Custer may have been wounded. Other accounts suggest that he commanded a wing of Custer's battalion, composed of Companies E and F. He was initially buried on the battlefield, but was reinterred in Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.Fort Leavenworth He left a widow and three children. His wife would spend many years as a teacher at the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. She would later be crushed to death in a New York City Subway accident in 1914. Yates' brother-in-law, Richard Roberts, had accompanied the Custer column as a civilian herder and part-time correspondent for the New York Sun, but had to drop out 70 miles from the Little Bighorn when his pony gave out, thereby perhaps sparing his life. Honors Fort Yates in the Dakota Territory was named in his memory and honor, as well as Battery Yates at Fort Baker in Marin County, California, overlooking San Francisco Bay.

The District of West Augusta was a short-lived (1774‚Äì76) historical region of Colonial Virginia that encompassed much of what is now northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania.  History  Before the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania agreed to extend the Mason-Dixon line westward from the western boundary line of the Province of Maryland, both claimed a large area of what is now southwestern Pennsylvania. The area was sparsely populated in the years following the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì63), and neither colony made any serious attempts at forming a local government until the early 1770s. Virginia administered the region as a part of Augusta County, Virginia. Pennsylvania later established Westmoreland County with its seat at Hannastown, overlapping Virginia's claims. Virginia's governor, Lord Dunmore, traveled to Pittsburgh, which Virginia claimed as part of its territory, to appoint government officials under the Virginia charter. In 1774, the Virginia assembly separated the western portion of Augusta County's territory and formed the District of West Augusta. The preamble to a later act defined the boundaries of West Augusta as follows: :Whereas, it is expedient to ascertain the boundary between the county of Augusta and the district of West Augusta-Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, that the boundary between the said district and county shall be as follows: :Beginning on the Alleghany Mountains, between the heads of the Potomac, Cheat and Green Briar Rivers (Haystack Knob, or north end of Pocahontas County); :thence along the ridge of mountains which divides the waters of Cheat River from those of Green Briar, and that branch of the Monongahela River called Tyger's Valley River, to the Monongahela River; :thence up the said river, and the west fork thereof, to Bingerman's Creek, on the northwest side of the said west fork; :thence up the said creek to the head thereof, :thence in a direct course to the head of Middle Island Creek, a branch of the Ohio, :and thence to the Ohio, including all the waters of said creek in the aforesaid District of West Augusta, all that territory lying to the northward of the aforesaid boundary, and to the westward of the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland, shall be deemed, and is hereby declared to be, within the District of West Augusta. The following several years were contentious. Local officials from Virginia arrested their counterparts from Pennsylvania and vice versa. Each state made movements to stem the flow of settlers from the other state. The government of West Augusta was administered from Fort Dunmore in what is now Pittsburgh. The seat of government was later moved to Augusta Town in what is now Washington County, Pennsylvania. In August 1776, Augusta Town became the site of the first court west of the Monongahela River. In 1776, the District of West Augusta was divided into three counties: Ohio County, Monongalia County, and Yohogania County. Ohio County encompassed most of the western region of the district bordering the Ohio River, including parts of what are now Washington and Greene Counties in Pennsylvania. Monongalia County encompassed much of what is now north-central West Virginia, and parts of what are now Washington, Greene and Fayette Counties in Pennsylvania. Yohogania County consisted of much of what is now southwestern Pennsylvania, including all of what is now Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, parts of the present counties of Washington, Fayette, Allegheny, and Beaver, and the counties of Hancock County, West Virginia and the northern part of Brooke County, West Virginia. In 1780, the boundary dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania was finally settled when both sides agreed to extend the Mason-Dixon line westward from Maryland to 80¬∞ 31‚Ä≤ west, the current western border of Pennsylvania. Most of Yohogania County became part of Pennsylvania; that section of its lands was divided between Westmoreland County and the newly formed Washington County in Pennsylvania; Beaver and Allegheny were later created from those counties. The relatively small part of Yohogania that remained in Virginia was subsumed into Ohio County. That area is now divided between Brooke County and Hancock County, Virginia (now West Virginia), which were later formed from Ohio County, at the northernmost tip of West Virginia's Northern Panhandle.

Biography =Discovering trisomy 21= In 1958, while working in Raymond Turpin‚Äôs laboratory with Marthe Gautier, J√©r√¥me Lejeune reported that he had discovered that Down syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. According to Lejeune's laboratory notebooks, he made the observation demonstrating the link on 22 May 1958. The discovery was published by the French Academy of Sciences with Lejeune as first author, Gautier as second author, and Turpin as senior author. In 2009, co-author Gautier claimed that the discovery was based on fibroblast tissue samples that she had prepared and noticed the discrepancy in chromosome count on.\\"The history of cytogenetics\\" S. Gilgenkrantz, E.M. Rivera, March 2003 p. 5 This discovery was the first time that a defect in intellectual development was shown to be linked to chromosomal abnormalities. Origins of the discovery In the early 1950s, Lejeune joined the department headed by Turpin, who suggested that Lejeune focus his research on the causes of Down syndrome. As early as 1953, the two men showed a connection between an individual‚Äôs characteristics and his or her dermatoglyphs‚Äìthe fingerprints and lines on the hand. The structure of these lines, which remain the same throughout the individual's life, is determined during the earliest stages of embryo development. As Lejeune and Turpin studied the hands of children with Down syndrome, they deduced that their dermatoglyphic anomalies appeared during embryo formation. After making many more observations, Lejeune concluded that the anomalies resulted from a chromosomal accident. Using a new tissue culture technique brought back from the United States by his colleague Marthe Gautier, Lejeune began working with her to count the number of chromosomes in children with Down syndrome. The laboratory notebook begun by Lejeune on 10 July 1957 indicates that on 22 May 1958 he succeeded in showing, for the first time, the presence of 47 chromosomes in a child with Down syndrome. This was two years after Tjio and Levan had proven that the human species has 46 chromosomes. On 13 June 1958, Lejeune identified an additional case, and a photo of the karyotype met with skeptical interest at the International Congress of Genetics in Montreal. The international community did not grasp the full impact of his discovery until 26 January 1959, when the French Academy of Sciences published the team‚Äôs first paper presenting three case studies of children with Down syndrome. On 16 March 1959, another presentation to the Academy of Sciences confirmed the team's initial publication, this time covering nine cases. In April 1959, the English team of Brown and Jacobs corroborated these results, citing the initial January 1959 publication by Lejeune, Gautier, and Turpin. ‚ÄúMongolism‚Äù had become trisomy 21. The discovery opened up a new field of investigation for modern genetics and laid the foundation for a new discipline: cytogenetics. Gautier disputes his claim as the first discoverer of trisomy 21. She has stated in interviews and in a 2009 article in the journal M√©decine/Sciences that she worked without assistance from Lejeune to develop the necessary cytological and histological resources and techniques, and used these to prepare microscope slides showing the trisomy. By her account, Lejeune took her slides away under the pretence of having them photographed for her, but instead presented them as his own work at a conference and in a subsequent publication. From the available published evidence it is clear that both Lejeune and Gautier contributed significantly to the discovery, but it remains unclear who was first. In a personal letter from 5 November 1958 to Gautier, Lejeune wrote appreciatively about 'your preparations' that were instrumental to the discovery, and Gautier appeared as co-author on two seminal papers: one on the discovery of trisomy 21 and a second one about the cell culture techniques that Gautier had learned during a scholarship (1955‚Äì1956) at Harvard, Boston which made the discovery possible. =Later research and recognition= Continuing his work in genetics, Lejeune described several other diseases related to chromosomal abnormalities. In 1963 he identified Cri du Chat syndrome, caused by a missing segment in the short arm of chromosome 5, and in 1966 he described 18q-Syndrome, which results from loss of the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 18. Lejeune also discovered the Dr phenotype (a malformation syndrome in which a ring-shaped chromosome replaces chromosome 13), and he identified trisomies on chromosome 9 in 1970 and chromosome 8 in 1971. In a 1963 presentation before the French Academy of Sciences, Lejeune showed that monosomy‚Äîthe absence of a specific segment of the genome‚Äîcould also result in a clinically recognizable disease. Several years later, a group of American scientists came to Paris to conduct an independent investigation of Lejeune‚Äôs discovery, and in 1962 the President of the United States personally presented him with the Kennedy Prize. In 1964, the first chair of human genetics was created at the Paris School of Medicine, and Lejeune was named to fill it. The appointment was highly unusual: only a groundbreaking discovery allowed a candidate to be named a professor of medicine without successfully completing a competitive residency examination. In 1969, Lejeune's work earned him the William Allan Award, granted by the American Society of Human Genetics, the world‚Äôs highest honor in genetics. he was the only Frenchman to have won it. =Pro-life work= Although Lejeune‚Äôs discoveries paved the way for new therapeutic research into how changes in gene copy number could cause disease, they also led to the development of prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities and thence to abortions of affected pregnancies. This was very distressing to Lejeune, a devout Catholic, and led him to begin his fight for the pro-life cause. Lejeune opposed the authorization in 1967 for women to use contraception as well as the Peyret laws in 1970 to render legal the interruption of pregnancy in case of fetal abnormalities. He also opposed the Veil Law (\\"Loi Veil\\" 1975) authorizing voluntary interruption of pregnancy. After receiving the Allan prize, Lejeune gave a talk to his colleagues which concluded by explicitly questioning the morality of abortion, an unpopular viewpoint in the profession. In a letter to his wife, Lejeune wrote \\"today, I lost my Nobel prize in Medicine.\\" In 1975, after one of his public appearances in Paris on the beginning of life, Lejeune met Wanda Poltawska, director of the Catholic Institute for the Family in Krakow. Later that year, Poltawska contacted Lejeune twice, asking him to speak at conferences on the beginning of life that she was organizing with one of her close friends, Monsignor Karol Wojtyla, then Cardinal-Archbishop of Krakow. On 16 October 1978 Wojtyla was elected Pope John Paul II. Afterward, Lejeune regularly traveled to Rome to meet with the Pope, to attend meetings of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and to participate in other church events, such as the 1987 Synod of Bishops. The Pope wanted to name Lejeune as the president of a new pontifical academy that was dear to his heart: the Pontifical Academy for Life. Lejeune painstakingly drafted its bylaws and the oath of the Servants of Life that each member of the Academy must take. Lejeune was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 1993. He served as president of the Academy for only a few weeks before his death in April 1994. A few years later, during his visit to Paris for World Youth Day 1997, John Paul II visited Lejeune‚Äôs grave in Ch√¢lo-Saint- Mars. Lejeune has been named \\"Servant of God\\" by the Catholic Church, and his cause for sainthood is being postulated by the Abbey of Saint Wandrille in France. Honors, awards and credentials J√©r√¥me Lejeune received many distinctions during his lifetime. He was a member of: * the French Institute‚Äôs Academy of Moral and Political Sciences * the French Academy of Medicine * the Pontifical Academy of Sciences * the Lyncean Academy in Rome * the American Academy of Arts and Sciences * the Royal Swedish Academy * the National Academy of Medicine in Argentina * the University of Santiago, Chile Lejeune held honorary doctorates from: * University of D√ºsseldorf, Germany * University of Navarra, Spain * University of Buenos Aires, Argentina * Pontifical Catholic University of Chile His international positions included: * World Health Organization (WHO) Consulting expert on human genetics (1962) * International Commission on Radiological Protection Committee member (1963) * United Nations ** French expert to the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation Bibliography * Life is a Blessing by Clara Lejeune * The Concentration Can by J√©r√¥me Lejeune * The Tiniest Humans by Robert L.

He had initially been the voivode, or head, of the Vlachs in Maramure»ô in the Kingdom of Hungary. However, when the first certain record was made of him in 1343, he was mentioned as a former voivode who had become disloyal to Louis I of Hungary. He invaded the domains of a Vlach landowner who remained loyal to the king in 1349. Four years later, he was again mentioned as voivode in a charter, which was the last record of his presence in Maramure»ô. Bogdan and his retainers left Maramure»ô for Moldavia between 1359 and 1365. Moldavia had been under the rule of Sas of Moldavia, a vassal of Louis I of Hungary, but the local Vlachs were opposed to the Hungarian suzerainty. Bogdan expelled Sas's son, Balc, by force and seized the throne. In retaliation, Louis I confiscated Bogdan's estates in Maramure»ô in 1365. Bogdan reigned as the first voivode of Moldavia. He did not accept the overlordship of Louis I of Hungary, transforming Moldavia into the second independent Romanian principality.  Origins  Bogdan's early life is subject to scholarly debates. According to a theory, Bogdan was descended from a Vlach family, native to Maramure»ô. His ancestral estates formed a \\"valley knezate\\" with its center in Cuhea. According to a concurrent theory, Bogdan was identical with one Voivode Bogdan, son of Mikola. A royal charter, dated to 6 October 1335, narrated that Charles I of Hungary had sent Ladislaus J√°nki, Archbishop of Kalocsa, to Clisura DunƒÉrii three times in 1334 and 1335 to make preparations for the movement of Bogdan, son of Mikola, from \\"his country\\" to the Kingdom of Hungary. Historian P√°l Engel says that Voivode Bogdan led a large group of Vlachs from Serbia to Hungary on this occasion. The royal charter neither referred to Bogdan's ethnicity, nor mentioned large groups of Vlachs. Historian Victor Spinei emphasizes that the \\"similitude of the names is insufficient to identify\\" Bogdan, son of Mikola, with Bogdan, the future voivode of Moldavia. At Cuhea, the ruins of a church and a manor house were unearthed. The church was dedicated to King St Stephen. Besides its dedication, the presence of a sacristy to the north of the altar shows that it was a Roman Catholic church, suggesting that either Bogdan's family converted to Catholicism or an originally Catholic church building was transformed to serve an Orthodox family. The oldest parts of the manor house were built in the late , but it was enlarged in the middle of the next century. Bogdan's domain in Maramure»ô was described in a royal charter, issued on 2 February 1365. It listed Ieud, Bachkow, two Vi»ôeus (now Vi»ôeu de Jos and Vi»ôeu de Sus), Moisei, Bor»ôa and Keethzeleste among Bogdan's villages. The list shows that Bogdan's domain was situated along the upper courses of the rivers Iza and Vi»ôeu.  Conflicts in Maramure≈ü  When Charles I's son, Louis I of Hungary, ascended the throne in July 1342, Bogdan had already been the voivode of Maramure≈ü. At that time, the Vlach knezes, or chiefs, of Maramure≈ü elected their voivodes from among their number. Louis I's charter, dated to 21 October 1343, referred to Bogdan as \\"former voivode of Maramure≈ü, disloyal to us\\", showing that Bogdan had come into conflict with the king or the king's representatives and lost his office. The document referred to a debate between Bogdan and J√°nos K√∂lcsei, the royal castellan of Visk (now Vyshkovo in Ukraine), but the causes and exact circumstances of the debate are unknown. According to historians Radu Carciumaru and Victor Spinei, Louis I's attempts to limit the voivodes' privileges caused the conflict. Spinei writes that the king exploited the conflicts between the leading Vlach families to depose Bogdan with the assistance of local knezes, thus hindering him from rising up in open rebellion. On the other hand, Ioan-Aurel Pop says that Bogdan staged a rebellion against the sovereign which lasted for years. After his deposition, Bogdan did not leave Maramure≈ü. King Louis mentioned Bogdan as \\"an inveterate disloyal subject of ours\\" in a royal charter, issued on 15 September 1349, suggesting that Bogdan's relations with the king had worsened between 1343 and 1349. According to the document, Bogdan attempted to persuade a Vlach knez, Giula of Giule≈üti, and his six sons to join him. For the Giule≈ütis refused him, Bogdan and his nephew, Stephen, invaded their domains in Maramure≈ü and expelled them from there. King Louis ordered John, voivode of Maramure≈ü (who was Stephen's brother and Bogdan's nephew) to restore the Giule≈ütis in their estates at an assembly of the knezes in the presence of Andrew Lackfi, isp√°n, or head, of Maramure»ô County. The presence of Bogdan in Maramure≈ü was last documented on 14 May 1353. On this day, the Eger Chapter determined the boundaries of the domain of Bogdan's two nephews, Stephen and John, in Cuhea. The document mentioned both Stephen and John as the king's \\"loyal servants\\" and referred to their uncle as \\"Voivode Bogdan\\", without mentioning his disloyalty. Bogdan must have been present, because the boundaries of his nephews' estates were fixed in the presence of the neighboring landowners, including Bogdan, according to the document.  Voivode of Moldavia  The biographer of Louis I of Hungary, John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë recorded that \\"Bogdan, the voivode of the Romanians of Maramure≈ü, gathering the Romanians from this district, secretly passed into Moldavia, which was subject to the Hungarian Crown, but had been abandoned by its inhabitants because of the vicinity of the Tatars.\\" Moldavia had been a defensive march of the Kingdom of Hungary. According to the earliest Moldavian chronicles, it came into being when a Vlach lord, Drago»ô, and his people left Maramure≈ü and settled on the banks of the Moldova River in the late 1340s or the 1350s. Both Drago»ô and his successor, Sas, accepted Louis I's suzerainty. No contemporaneous sources mentioned the reasons of Bogdan's movement to Moldavia. According to Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean, Bogdan left Maramure≈ü because he \\"failed to get rid of the Hungarian hegemony\\". Victor Spinei writes that Drago»ô's example encouraged Bogdan to cross the Carpathian Mountains, especially because he knew that the Vlachs in Moldavia were opposed to Louis I's authority. A diploma of King Louis, issued on 20 March 1360, mentioned that the Vlachs rose up in open rebellion in Moldavia, but Drago»ô of Giule»ôtione of the six sons of Bogdan's former opponent, Giula of Giule»ôtidefeated them, restoring the king's rule in Moldavia. According to a royal charter, dated to 2 February 1365, Bogdan and his (unnamed) sons had \\"stealthily\\" fled from Hungary because they wanted to seize Moldavia. Balc, the son of Sas of Moldavia, tried to resist them, but Bogdan and his sons forced him to withdraw to Hungary. In retaliation, Louis I of Hungary confiscated Bogdan's domain in Maramure≈ü and donated it to Balc and his brothers. Bogdan seized the province after Balc left for Hungary. Bogdan's action took place before 2 February 1365, but the exact date is debated. The earliest year, proposed by historians, is 1359; historians suggesting this date say that Bogdan took advantage of the local Vlachs' rebellion, documented by the 1360 royal diploma. Dennis Deletant writes that Bogdan invaded Moldavia around 1363. Radu Carciumaru proposes the same year; he says that Bogdan took advantage both of a conflict between Louis I of Hungary and Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and of the decisive victory of the Lithuanians over the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters. Bogdan's action took place in 1364, according to Victor Spinei, and only in 1365, according to Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean. Grave of Bogdan at Bogdana Monastery, RƒÉdƒÉu≈£i John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë mentioned that Louis I's army often invaded Moldavia, but the \\"number of Vlachs inhabiting that land increased, transforming it into a country\\". John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë even wrote that Louis I fought most frequently against Moldavia and Serbia during his reign. However, the king's itinerary, reconstructed based on his charters, suggests that he could only take part in military actions against Moldavia in 1366, 1368 and 1370. John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë stated that the king's suzerainty had been restored in Moldavia. According to Spinei, Louis I could only force Bogdan's son, La≈£cu, to yield to him after Louis became King of Poland in 1370. The boundaries of Moldavia during Bogdan's reign cannot exactly be determined. According to historian Lauren≈£iu RƒÉdvan, his realm included the northwestern regions between the Carpathian Mountains and the Dniester River, maybe as far as the Cheremosh River. Bogdan's seat was at Siret where a royal residence had been built during Drago»ô's reign, according to the Moldavian chronicles. He died in 1365 or 1367. He was buried in the Saint Nicholas Monastery at RƒÉdƒÉu≈£i. Bogdan was succeeded by his son, La≈£cu.  Legacy  The foundation of the independent Principality of Moldaviathe second independent Romanian state after the Principality of Wallachiais attributed to Bogdan by modern historians. The list of the voivodes of Moldavia, recorded in the Bistri»õa Monastery in 1407, begins with Bogdan, without referring to his predecessors, Drago»ô and Sas, who were mentioned in all Moldavian chronicles. In Turkic documents, Moldavia was mentioned as \\"Kara-Boƒüdan\\", or \\"Black Bogdan\\", from the late 14th century onward, which also shows his fame.

The submarines were built by students of the √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure (School of Higher Technology) in Montreal, Quebec, for the International Submarine Races. , Omer teams hold the human-powered submarine world speed records for two-seater and non-propeller categories. Those records are : Omer 5 team - 2007 Omer 6 team - 2007 *8.035 knots for Omer 5 (two-seater) *4.96 knots for Omer 11 (one-seater / non-propeller) Omer 11 is the latest generation of Omer submarine. History Since 1992, a group of students from the √â.T.S. in electrical, mechanical, software and automated automation engineering have taken part in the completion of Omer, a human-powered submarine. The first generation of Omer was a two-seater submarine that made its mark around the world. Despite the students' efforts and with numerous prizes and awards in conception and innovation, Omer was not the world's fastest submarine. Otherwise, at the first presence of the Omer team, a variable pitch system was operational and gave good performances and helped the next Omer submarines to increase their speed. In September 1995, the team decided that Omer would become the world's champion. With new members' ideas and older members' expertise, Omer 2 was born. In four months, a new hull was made and a new onboard computer was added to control the variable pitch from the propeller, and to give some information to the pilot as well. Omer went to California for a competition in May 1996, where it won a world record in the two-seater category. With that victory in hand, the team decided to aim for first place in the one-seater category. Construction on Omer 3 began. The team found success in Washington in June 1997, winning world record in all categories. In the summer of 2001, Omer 4 was set to beat the previous world record of 7.192 knots. Since then, a new electrical control system has been tested and integrated for the 2002 competition in California. Since their creation, Omer, Omer 2 and Omer 3 had a lot of visibility in the media, and gained offers of help from individuals and corporations. In the summer of 2003, Omer 5, the new two-seater submarine took first place again using the experience acquired from Omer 4. The new submarine is now much more stable than Omer 4. In 2005, it beat the world speed record for a two-seater submarine setting the mark at 7.061 knots. In the summer of 2007, the submarine Omer 5 set the new world record reaching a speed of 8.035 knots. Omer 6 a submarine using non-propeller reach 4.642 knots, with its driver Nicolas Tardif, setting also a world record for non-propeller submarine. 2007 results Carderock, Maryland, June 28, 2007 ‚Äì Speed results by division in the 9th International Submarine Races held June 25‚Äì29 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center's Carderock Division David Taylor Model Basin in Bethesda, Maryland: Two Person Propeller: #8.035 knots, OMER 5, √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure, University of Quebec #4.795 knots, F-A-U Boat, Florida Atlantic University #4.775 knots, Drekar, Western Washington University #4.043 knots, Sub Taxi, Independent One Person Propeller: #7.420 knots, Wasub V, Delft University of Technology #6.473 knots, Archimede 4, √âcole Polytechnique de Montreal #5.022 knots, Maroon Harpoon, Texas A&M; #4.958 knots, Mercury, University of Michigan #4.835 knots, Sublime, Hernando County Schools, Spring Hill, Florida #3.771 knots, Phantom 5, Virginia Tech #3.488 knots, Sea Wolf, Hernando County Schools #2.343 knots, Dive Dawg, University of Washington #2.262 knots, Swamp Thing, University of Florida #1.694 knots, U-3.2, Sussex Technical High School, New Jersey #1.285 knots, RSR Fourier, University of Maryland #0.505 knots, Sea Car, Don Burton, Independent One-Person, Non- Propeller: #4.642 knots, OMER 6, √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure, University of Quebec #2.092 knots, Sea Bomb, University of Bath, UK #2.035 knots, Sebastion, University of California San Diego #0.854 knots, Bogus Batoid, Bruce Plazyk, Independent #0.499 knots, Battlin' Pete, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy External links *Omer submarine *√âcole de technologie Sup√©rieure website *International Submarine Race website Category:Midget submarines Category:√âcole de technologie sup√©rieure Category:Human-powered vehicles Category:Underwater sports Category:Submarines of Canada Category:Human- powered submarines ","title":"Omer (submarine)"},{"id":"2356643","text":"Joyce Benignia Van Patten (born March 9, 1934) is an American actress.

He was the favorite scout of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and has been called \\"perhaps the most famous Native American scout to serve the U.S. Army.\\" Bloody Knife was born to a Hunkpapa Sioux father and an Arikara mother around 1840. He was abused and discriminated against by the other Sioux in his village because of his background, in particular by Gall, a future chief. When Bloody Knife was a teenager, he left his village with his mother to live with the Arikara tribe. His brothers were killed during a Sioux raid led by Gall in 1862. Bloody Knife found employment as a courier and hunter for the American Fur Company and later served under Alfred Sully before scouting for George Custer on several military expeditions. He died from a bullet wound to the head on June 25, 1876, during the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Early life While his exact date and place of birth are unknown, Bloody Knife was probably born between 1837 and 1840 in Dakota Territory. His father was a Hunkpapa Sioux and his mother a member of the Arikara tribe, also known as the Ree. Along with brothers and perhaps one sister, he lived with his father's tribe during his early childhood, but was not well-treated by them because of their enmity with his mother's people. Bloody Knife grew to hate the Sioux and especially a Sioux named Gall. Gall was the adopted brother of Sitting Bull, but while Sitting Bull had also mistreated Bloody Knife it was his peer with whom Bloody Knife developed an enduring feud. When Bloody Knife's mother left his father in 1856 to return to her own tribe, Bloody Knife joined her. About fifteen, he found himself on the Upper Missouri River at an American Fur Company trading post called Fort Clark. Conflicts between the Arikaras and Sioux were routine there, with Sioux war parties attacking Arikaras who wandered too far from the fort. In spite of the threat they represented, Bloody Knife took on and succeeded in the dangerous job of delivering mail to other forts in Missouri and to Fort Totten in North Dakota. He did not, however, pass through these years unscathed. During a visit to his father, Bloody Knife was‚Äîcontrary to the customary protection of guests‚Äîattacked and ambushed by Gall and several other Hunkpapas who beat him severely, stripped him, spat on him, mocked him and hit him with coup sticks and musket ramrods. In the fall of 1862, two of his brothers were killed, mutilated, and scalped by a Sioux war party led by Gall. Their bodies were left to be eaten by wolves. First years as a scout After working for the American Fur Company, Bloody Knife accompanied Brigadier General Alfred Sully in 1865 as a scout on his Sioux expedition. Bloody Knife proved useful to the group of Galvanized Yankees, prisoner soldiers from the Confederate States Army who served the Union in the America West instead of serving time in a prisoner-of-war camp at Fort Berthold. He also worked as a messenger, helping the troops to communicate with other military units in the area, which was still mainly controlled by the Sioux. In late 1865, Bloody Knife met with Captain Adams Bassett of Company C, Fourth U.S. Volunteer Infantry, whom he told that Gall had recently arrived near Fort Berthold, that Gall was not peaceful and had killed white men along the Missouri River. Bassett sent a lieutenant with a platoon and Bloody Knife to capture Gall or kill him if he would not surrender. Bloody Knife led the soldiers to the Hunkpapa village, south of the fort where Gall was staying. The men attempted to arrest Gall upon arrival, but when Gall tried to escape he was bayoneted and forced to the ground, and was twice stabbed with bayonets. The story goes that Bloody Knife took aim to administer a killing shot to Gall's head, but the officer in command knocked the shot wide, claiming Gall was already dead. Bloody Knife argued furiously with the officer to no avail. He departed, leaving Gall alive to become a Sioux war chief. However, since similar stories have been told about Gall attempting to kill Sitting Bull and being prevented, the story may be apocryphal. Pictured above, to the far left, kneeling is Bloody Knife next to George Custer, seated in the center In 1866, President Andrew Johnson authorized the formation of a force of Indian scouts when he signed the Indian Scout Enlistment Act. Bloody Knife enlisted as a corporal at Fort Stevenson in May 1868, but his early service was not without issue. Bloody Knife had a problem with alcohol that may have led to him deserting his post in September 1868. By 1872, the year of his involvement in the Yellowstone Expedition, he became a lance corporal. Friendship and early work with Custer In 1873, at Fort Rice, he met George Armstrong Custer. The two became friends, and Custer admired Bloody Knife's talents as a scout. Although Bloody Knife is said to have been insolent, Custer was amused by his candor. He was himself a volatile man, and during an expedition in 1874 would shoot at Bloody Knife during a fit of rage. Custer occasionally gave Bloody Knife gifts, including a silver medal inscribed with Bloody Knife's name that Custer ordered from Washington. Bloody Knife quickly became Custer's favorite scout. On the next Yellowstone Expedition, Bloody Knife joined Custer and fought against the Sioux. Bloody Knife helped to discover an abandoned Sioux village which he estimated to have held 1,000 warriors. The group followed the trail, which led them to a battle at Yellowstone. Black Hills Expedition Pictured from left to right are Bloody Knife, George Armstrong Custer, Private John Noonan, and Captain William Ludlow. In 1874, Bloody Knife took part in the Black Hills Expedition, which included over a thousand men, geologists, infantry, cavalry, two miners, several reporters, and sixty-five Arikara scouts. Shortly before the beginning of the expedition, the Sioux attacked the Arikara village at Fort Berthold, killing five Arikaras and one Mandan. One of Bloody Knife's sons was killed in the attack and another scout, called Bear's Ears or Bear's Eye, lost a brother in the same attack. Bloody Knife blamed the death of his son on Gall. Many of the Arikara on the expedition wanted to avenge the attack and when they found signs of a band of Sioux in the Black Hills, they began to sing war songs and adorned their horses and themselves with war paint. Custer was not interested in solving tribal feuds and ordered the scouts not to attack any Sioux unless fired upon first. Bloody Knife and twenty-five other Arikaras were sent out for more scouting and found a small camp of five lodges. The scouts waited for Custer to arrive with his interpreter, Louis Agard, before taking any action. Although some reports suggested the presence of thousands of warriors in the hills preparing to attack, and most of the expedition thought that a fight would occur soon, Bloody Knife discovered a group of only twenty-seven Oglala Sioux, who had been cutting lodgepoles and hunting in the Black Hills and intended return to the Red Cloud Agency, one hundred miles south of their location. The group had no knowledge of the soldiers in the area and all but one Oglala ran away when Agard and some of the scouts approached them. On August 7, 1874, Bloody Knife encountered a grizzly bear roughly seventy-five yards from where Custer was searching for a campsite. Custer, having had a lifelong dream of killing a grizzly bear, shot the bear twice with his Remington rifle, hitting it in the thigh, and Bloody Knife and William Ludlow helped with the kill. The bear was an old male with broken teeth, covered in scars, and weighed . Though Custer took credit for the kill, some believe that the fatal bullet was fired by Bloody Knife, and 2002 biography The Custer Companion states that the coup de gr√¢ce was a cut to the jugular vein by Bloody Knife. During the Black Hills Expedition, several wagons became stuck at a bank. Custer asked whose fault the delay was and a scout named Charley Reynolds blamed Bloody Knife for the incident. Custer drew his revolver and fired shots in the two scouts' direction. Bloody Knife and Reynolds hid behind some trees. Bloody Knife then told Custer, \\"It is not a good thing you have done to me; if I had been possessed of madness too, you would not see another day.\\" Custer replied, \\"My brother, it was the madness of the moment that made me do this, but it is now gone. Let us shake hands and be friends again.\\" Bloody Knife agreed and shook Custer's hand. While most Indian scouts earned $13 a month, the same amount of pay as the troops received, Custer arranged a job for Bloody Knife with the quartermaster as a guide, where he earned $75 ($ at today's prices) per month. On November 30, 1874, Private Bloody Knife was discharged from service, and for his efforts in the Black Hills Expedition, he received an additional $150 for what was called his \\"invaluable assistance\\". Death at The Battle of Little Bighorn In 1876, during the Little Bighorn campaign, Bloody Knife repeatedly tried to warn Custer there were too many Indians to fight. In spite of the overwhelming odds, he refused to stay out of the battle. By some accounts, before the battle began, Bloody Knife signaled to the sun with his hands, \\"I shall not see you go down behind the hills tonight.\\" Bloody Knife was assigned to Major Marcus Reno, who had a command of 140 soldiers, at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. During the battle, Custer directed Bloody Knife and the other Arikara and Crow scouts to drive off the herds of Indian ponies in the Sioux camp. As Reno's soldiers and scouts approached the camp, the Indians, mostly Lakota-Sioux and Cheyenne, spotted them and quickly mobilized their warriors to attack Reno. The soldiers quickly dismounted and formed a skirmish line to shoot at the enemy, but they kept coming and Reno's unit began taking heavy casualties. Reportedly, Bloody Knife was standing next to Reno, who had motioned for Bloody Knife to approach him so he could ask Bloody Knife what the Indians would do when his command began to move away from their village. Bloody Knife was shot in the head and killed while mounted on his horse before making a reply. Reno, his face smeared with the gore from Bloody Knife's wound, panicked and ordered a withdrawal. Reno and his men retreated into woodland near the river with the braves in aggressive pursuit, and his poor response cost many of his troops their lives. Bloody Knife was one of three Arikara scouts assigned to Reno to die during the battle; the others were Little Brave (also known as Bear's Trail or Little Soldier) and Bobtail Bull. The US Army suffered a huge defeat. Bloody Knife was decapitated by the Sioux. According to Bloody Knife's sister, her daughters had found his body on the battlefield, and unaware that it was the body of their uncle, cut off his head and took it to the Hunkpapa village where it was displayed on a pole. When she saw the head and recognized it as that of her brother, Bloody Knife's sister was horrified. According to David Humphreys Miller, an interviewer who talked with many of the participants and witnesses from the battle, she cried out: \\"Gall has killed him at last!\\" However, other accounts do not mention Gall nor the sisters' reactions at their discovery of the head's identity. In the aftermath of the battle, Colonel John Gibbon's troops found and identified by its gray color pattern the scalp of Bloody Knife in an empty Sioux lodge. These remains were buried on the battlefield on June 27, 1876. Later he was buried in the scout cemetery near White Shield, North Dakota.Browning, James A. Violence Was No Stranger (1993). Barbed Wire Press. . Legacy Bloody Knife had wed an Arikara woman named Young Owl Woman, or She Owl, in 1866. He fathered at least three children, a daughter and two sons. The daughter died of an illness on December 28, 1870, and was buried at Fort Buford. One son was killed in a raid by Lakota on the Arikara village before the Black Hills Expedition of 1874. The other lived until 1904, when he was killed supposedly by his own wife. Young Owl Woman served as Bloody Knife's legal heir. On April 14, 1879, she appeared at Fort Berthold to claim outstanding pay for his services to the army. In 1881, she received his final $91.66 in wages from the US Government. Bloody Knife's deeds were remembered in song composed by the Arikara scouts after his death at the Battle of Little Big Horn. His story spread wide, and he became one of the more famous scouts associated with the army. In the 1991 television mini-series Son of the Morning Star, Bloody Knife was portrayed by Sheldon Peters Wolfchild.

Z.\\" Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton; March 16, 1946) is an American spiritual teacher and author known for her purported channelling of a spiritual entity named Ramtha. Knight has appeared on US TV shows, such as Larry King, MSNBC and The Merv Griffin Show, as well as in media such as Psychology Today. Her teachings have attracted figures from the entertainment and political world such as Linda Evans and Shirley MacLaine. Knight claims to bridge ancient wisdom and the power of consciousness together with the latest discoveries in science. Some of the ideas are similar to those of Shirley MacLaine, which have in turn been criticized for being \\"kindergarten metaphysics\\" by mathematician and skeptic Martin Gardner. Shirley Maclaine claimed in her book that she was the brother of Ramtha in their Atlantean past lives. Ramtha's teachings have been criticized by scientists and skeptics. The Southern Poverty Law Center has criticized Knight for \\"homophobic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic racist rants\\".Southern Poverty Law Center - Ramtha Riled - May 23, 2014 Knight lives in a French chateau-style home in Yelm, Washington, and next door, teaches courses and runs Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. Knight has been married three times and is the mother of two children from her first marriage (Brandy and Christopher), which ended in divorce. Career Knight grew up in poverty. After graduating from high school, she dropped out of business school. She later worked in the cable television industry, and due to her work moved to Tacoma, Washington, where, according to her autobiography, a psychic told her the \\"Enlightened One\\" would appear to her in the future. She says that Ramtha first appeared to her in her kitchen in 1977. Knight appeared on The Merv Griffin Show in 1985 and wrote the autobiographical A State of Mind in 1987. Time called her \\"probably the most celebrated of all current channelers\\". She is currently the president of JZK, Inc and Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, located near the town of Yelm, Washington. Knight owns several U.S. trademark registrations featuring the \\"Ramtha\\" name. She appeared in the 2004 documentary What the Bleep Do We Know!?, produced by members of the Ramtha School.Harriette Yahr, Let's get metaphysical . In Salon, 2004-09-09, page found 2010-07-03.Chris Lydgate, \\"What the #$*! is Ramtha\\" Willamette Week, December 22, 2004. Page found 2010-10-15. After an absence from public view of several years, she returned to public speaking on radio and in magazines and workshops. She was a guest on Coast To Coast AM with George Noory on August 14, 2011. Ramtha \\"Ramtha\\" (the name is claimed to be derived from Ram and to mean \\"the God\\" in Ramtha's language) is the name of a reputed entity whom Knight says she channels. According to Knight, Ramtha was a Lemurian warrior who fought the Atlanteans over 35,000 years ago.JZK Publishing; Revised & enlarged edition (February 14, 2005), Language: English, , Knight claims Ramtha speaks of leading an army over 2.5 million strong (more than twice the estimated world population at about 30,000 BC) for 63 years, and conquering three fourths of the known world (which was allegedly going through cataclysmic geological changes). According to Knight, Ramtha led the army for 10 years until he was betrayed and almost killed. Knight maintains Ramtha spent the next seven years in isolation recovering and observing nature, the seasons, his army making homes and families, and many other things. She says he later mastered many skills, including foresight and out-of-body experiences, until he led his army to the Indus River while in his late fifties (after having led his army for 63 years). According to Knight, Ramtha taught his soldiers everything he knew for 120 days, he bid them farewell, rose into the air and in a bright flash of light he ascended before them. Knight says he made a promise to his army he would come back to teach them everything he had learned. JZ Knight says in 1977 Ramtha appeared before her and told her he had come to help her over the ditch. JZ Knight claims to have become his first student of what she calls the great work. =Teachings= Ramtha is the central figure (the \\"master teacher\\") of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, started by Knight in 1987 near the town Yelm, Washington. Classes (or \\"dialogues\\") had been held around the world for the previous 10 years. There are currently over 6,000 students of Knight's teachings. A central theme of Knight's teachings involves the internalization of divinity (\\"God is in Us\\", \\"You are God, Behold God\\"). Knight describes Ramtha as having brought his knowledge to many ancient civilizations in the world such as the Ancient Egyptians. Her website also suggests traces of the lineage of the original teachings and philosophies she claims Ramtha taught 35,000 years ago have appeared throughout history in the schools of philosophers such as Socrates, religions such as Hinduism and Judaism, and the works of great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The four cornerstones of Knight's philosophy are: # The statement 'You are god' # The directive to make known the unknown # The concept that consciousness and energy create the nature of reality # The challenge to conquer yourself Knight's teachings appear to be a mixture of Jungian philosophy, Western occult traditions and contemporary positive- thinking attitudes (such as New Age beliefs) and have yet to stand against elementary skepticism or scrutiny. Predictions made by Knight in the name of the disembodied entity have either failed to come true (e.g. predicting a holocaust would take place in 1985, or the USA would be involved in a major war in 1985) or the predicted scenarios are too wide to evaluate and/or have too large an error margin to be considered, which is usually the case with channelers. When Knight says she is channeling Ramtha she speaks mostly in English in what sounds like an accent from the Indian Raj, sometimes in a simplistic way. The claimed entity \\"Ramtha\\" has expressed confusion about modern items (or even the ability to read English), although he seems to have clear understanding of complex issues of modern physics, such as the quantum field or neurology, which appear frequently in his speeches.An example: During the alleged channeling of Ramtha, JZ Knight behaves a bit differently and speaks in a deeper and stern voice. In her teachings \\"Ramtha\\" has made several controversial statements such as Christianity is a \\"backward\\" religion, that Jesus' parables can be explained by means of photon waves and probability, that \\"murder isn't really wrong or evil\\" (if one believes in reincarnation), or (during the court case JZ Knight v Jeff Knight) Jeff Knight stated Ramtha had declared HIV is Nature's way of 'getting rid of' homosexuality. The Southern Poverty Law Center observed \\"Ramtha\\" has made anti-semitic comments such as \\"\\"Fuck God's chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now\\". Controversy and criticism Most books regarding Ramtha and RSE come from JZK Publishing, one of the several companies started by Knight. Other books somewhat sympathetic to Ramtha, such as Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom by Gordon Melton, have ties to RSE in other ways. The author of Finding Enlightenment testified for Knight in Knight vs. Knight (1992‚Äì1995) against her former husband, Jeffery Knight (see below). Skeptics point to Ramtha's story as proof that he does not exist. Ramtha claims to come from the continent of Lemuria and to have conquered Atlantis. The existence of the two locations is considered of legendary nature, and neither has been found. Furthermore, the claim that Ramtha led an army of 2.5 million contradicts estimates of the world population at 33,000 BC, and her claims of clairvoyant, telepathic, telekinetic and other ESP abilities, for which there is no scientific support, have been heavily criticized by skeptics and scientific communities.For telepathy, see for example, Randi, James. Flim- Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions. Prometheus Books (June 1982) or Charpak, Georges and Henri Broch. Translated by Bart K. Holland. Debunked!: ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience. The Johns Hopkins University Press (March 25, 2004), \\"It would be foolish to accept [psychokinesis] (...) without solid scientific data\\": . A similar position is made by Richard Feynmann: Randi, James. An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural Ramtha's claim that every person can learn to create their own realityRamtha.com About Us is itself a philosophical paradox. Julian Baggini, in his book The pig that wants to be eaten, argues that if everyone was capable of creating their own realities with their minds, it would be problematic as one person could then create a reality in which no one was allowed to create their own realities. Magician and skeptic James Randi said that Ramtha's believers have \\"no way of evaluating [her teachings]\\", while Carl Sagan in his book The Demon-Haunted World says that \\"the simplest hypothesis is that Ms. Knight makes 'Ramtha' speak all by herself, and that she has no contact with disembodied entities from the Pleistocene Ice Age.\\" He goes on to write a list of questions that Ramtha's answers to would help us determine whether he is actually a disembodied entity from the paleolithic times (such as \\"What were the indigenous languages, and social structure?\\", \\"What was their writing like?\\" or \\"How do we know that he lived 35,000 years ago?\\"), and ends by saying that \\"[i]nstead, all we are offered are banal homilies.\\" Knight's former husband, Jeff Knight, in an interview in 1992 with Joe Szimhart, said that Ramtha's teachings are a \\"farce\\" and that they are \\"just a money making business for [JZ Knight]\\". He also said that students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment are \\"involved in a very dangerous, very evil corrupt thing\\". Attacks and criticism against Ramtha's teachings and Ramtha's School of Enlightenment have also been made by former students of the school. David McCarthy, a Yelm resident and former student of the school between 1989 and 1996, has accused the school of being a cult. He further claims that he was intimidated during his studies there, and he felt like mind control was being exerted by Knight and the school. He said \\"At one point I was running around scared I was going to get eaten by the lizard people.\\" McCarthy became disappointed, not only with his own experience of Ramtha's teachings but also as he had cut ties from his family to become a student as they lived in a different country. This led McCarthy to form a group called \\"Life After Ramtha's School of Enlightenment\\", which questions the authenticity of Ramtha and encourages people to come out and express their experiences after their realization that the RSE is a cult. The school has also been characterized as a cult by skeptic Michael Shermer in his book Why People Believe Weird Things. Glenn Cunningham, a former bodyguard of Knight's, in an interview with David McCarthy details the inner workings of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment and criticizes various activities (such as trademarking ideas and phrases that had been coined by other authors many years before - for example, the idea of \\"Blue Body\\", or mixing quantum physics with new age ideas, which can be found in Vera Stanley Alder's From the Mundane to the Magnificent, first published in 1979) of Knight's and aspects of Ramtha which he simply saw as Knight acting. Among the things he mentions is the fact that Ramtha mispronounces the same words that Knight mispronounces, and that Ramtha quotes the same books that Knight has read. Glenn Cunningham admits in the video interview, that he was prone to lying to students when he saw fit or thought that it may help them. Furthermore, Ramtha's teachings as they are portrayed in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know!?, not only in the general gist of the film (which was directed and funded by students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment) but also in instances where Ramtha is interviewed on screen, have been heavily criticized by the scientific community,\\"The minds boggle\\". The Guardian UnlimitedWhat the Bleep are they On About?! Australian Broadcasting Corporation and skeptics,Review by Eric Scerri of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry such as James Randi.2004 Pigasus awards James Randi Educational Foundation =Court cases= Knight has been involved in several court disputes, some personal and others business- related. She brought a suit against a woman from Berlin named Julie Ravell for disturbing Knight's psychic state and leaving her \\"hanging in spiritual limbo\\" during the five years Ravell claimed she was also channeling Ramtha. The case was brought to the supreme court in Vienna and lasted over five years, at the end of which Austria's supreme court awarded copyright to Knight as the sole channeler of Ramtha, and Ravell was made to pay $800 in psychic damages to Knight. Another case involving copyright and trademark ownership was JZK, Inc vs. Glandon, in which Joseph Glandon was accused of distributing copyrighted teachings of Ramtha.Jzk, Inc. v. Joseph Glandon In Knight vs. Knight (1992‚Äì1995), Jeff Knight alleges that he lost years of his life by postponing modern medical treatment for his HIV infection, due to advice from his wife that Ramtha could heal him. The court decided against him; he died before he could appeal the court's decision. Knight, through JZK Inc., accused WhiteWind Weaver, a Thurston County, Washington citizen, of stealing her ideas and using her and Ramtha's teachings in her workshops. A trial began on March 10, 2008, in Thurston County Superior Court and at the end of it Knight was awarded about $10,000 after the court's decision against WhiteWind Weaver. Knight also refused to attend court as a witness in a case involving a 15-year-old who claimed rape against two students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. The 15-year-old girl had written a letter to Knight which mentioned that Wayne Allen Geis, her dancing and acting teacher, had engaged in sexual intercourse with her from 1995 to 1997. The illicit activities had also involved Ruth Beverly Martin. They had apparently told the girl that sexual intercourse would help her to relax and improve her acting ability. Knight invited the girl to a retreat at the school in November 1999. In the retreat, Ramtha questioned the girl, her father, Geis and Martin. This inquiry took place on stage in front of an audience of over 800 people for about an hour. Geis and Martin confessed to having molested the girl, and the school contacted authorities. Charged with 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor, Geis and Martin pleaded not guilty and the case went to trial.Wilson, Kimberly A.C., ( October 4, 2010) \\"'Ramtha' may take stand in rape case\\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Retrieved October 15, 2010. Prosecutors were reluctant to have Knight appear in court due to the \\"circus atmosphere\\" that would have been created. Knight herself claimed that she had been in a trance and did not remember anything of what was said in the retreat inquiry.Associated Press, (October 10, 2010) \\"'Ramtha's channeler' can't testify\\".

In 2014, the company operated in 14 countries and had 49 offices with 19,000 employees serving 280 million consumers.  History  In 1995, Stanford graduates Kevin Taweel and Jim Ellis used a search fund to acquire the Houston-based roadside assistance company, Road Rescue. The roadside assistance service was sold through local wireless carriers. Four years later, they purchased Nashville-based Merrimac Group, which was offering specialty insurance to cover cellphones. The company began expanding its operations globally in 2003, with an expansion into Asia followed by expansions into Europe (2008) and Australia (2013). The company expanded into Latin America in 2014 with a partnership with America Movil. The company‚Äôs products, services, and clients have expanded since founding, due in part to acquisitions. On January 1, 2006, Lock/line merged with Asurion making Lock/line's former parent company, DST Systems Inc., 35 percent shareholder of the combine company. With the acquisition of Lumitrend on May 31, 2006, the company expanded its product portfolio to include CellBackup software. Cloud device management firm Soluto was acquired in 2013. Also in 2006, the company acquired Warranty Corporation of America (WaCA) then merged in 2008 with National Electronics Warranty (NEW Customer Service Company). As the company attempted to expand with new ventures, customer service was always an issue. So in February 2017, Asurion launched its Simplr subsidiary to provide customer-service via on demand staffing and machine learning. Through Soluto, Asurion acquired in 2017 Drippler, another tech support app company, and merged it with Soluto. In August 2019, Asurion acquired uBreakiFix national cellular phone repair chain. In 2018, Asurion borrowed $3.75 billion via two leveraged loans, the proceeds of which were to be funneled to the PE firms that acquired the company in 2007. The two loans brought the company's total term loans to $11.3 billion. Recognition The company received a CES Innovation Award in 2015 for its support and protection apps that combine live support and instant notifications.

It stars Judge Reinhold, Eddie Albert, Lori-Nan Engler, Jane Seymour, Richard Masur, Michael O'Donoghue, Ron Frazier, Merritt Butrick and was directed and written by Ken Finkleman. It is also the first film to be composed by James Newton Howard. Plot Jack Issel (Judge Reinhold) is a natural-born slacker who has just graduated from business school and joined I.N.C., a large American corporation based in Chicago. On his trip up the corporate ladder, he sees the dirty underside of the corporate world and how it corrupts people. His two mentors, the stuffy and buttoned up chief financial officer Scott Dantley (Michael O'Donoghue) and the chief operating officer Bob Nixon (Ron Frazier), in fact, show him first-hand how to cheat and blackmail one's way to the top. Jack is further aided by his personnel officer Max Landsberger (Richard Masur) who tells Jack that money and power come before people in the corporate world. Jack's supervisor and the public relations vice president, Jane Caldwell (Jane Seymour), also tells Jack exactly the same thing as Jack learns that Jane is a shady vixen who's hell-bent on sleeping her way to the top by seducing every man she meets to get ahead in what she sees as a man's world. Unsure of his abilities, and often incompetent, Jack can't figure out why he keeps getting promoted. Could it have something to do with his father (George Coe) being an influential (but corrupt) Senator? Among the numerous subplots, Jack meets and falls in love with a young woman named Rachel (Lori-Nan Engler), who turns out to be the radical, left-wing daughter of the ruthless chairman of the board and CEO, Pete Helmes (Eddie Albert), who is revealed to be promoting Jack so he can gain Jack's father, Senator Issel's support to close down a textile plant in a small upstate town called Allenville, and move it into the Latin American country of San Marcos for company self-interest. Jack spends the rest of the movie trying to stop I.N.C. from closing down the plant, and trying to win Rachel's heart to prove that he can be a good businessman. This film has a surprisingly strong supporting cast in the many interrelated and unrelated subplots who include such established stars as Danny DeVito, an inside trader named Frank Stedman, and Rick Moranis, as a screaming burnout executive Howard Gross, both of whom die 20 minutes into the film, the former committing suicide by jumping out of a window into a fountain, and the latter dying of a heart attack. Other subplots include an executive named Mike Hoover (Wallace Shawn), another burnout who learns he is dying from an unknown terminal illness and everyone, including his coke-sniffing best friend Al Kennedy (Bruce Wagner), is trying to maneuver into his job as head of the Latin American division. John Hudson (Merritt Butrick) is also a recent recruit at I.N.C. and one of Jack Issel's classmates who resorts to trickery to get ahead in the business. Boxing promoter Don King makes a cameo appearance as a I.N.C. executive. Midway through the movie, most of the subplots end without a resolution and the rest of the movie focuses entirely on the Jack-Rachel situation. Within a week of his employment, the further promoted Jack, with Max in tow, travel upstate to the town of Allenville to give a press conference on the closing of the textile plant where Rachel has organized a huge protest of thousands of workers and townspeople protesting the closing of the plant. The mob of townspeople attack and destroy Jack and Max's limousine, much to the chagrin of the company limo driver Sal (Don Novello). At the same time, to impress Rachel, rather than tell a fabricated public relations story about the closing of the plant, Jack tells the truth to the reporters about I.N.C. reasons which are entirely of self-interest, while both the enraged Helmes and Jack's father watch the event on their TV sets. This does win over Rachel's affections and that night, she and Jack spend the night together. The following morning, while Helmes decides to fire Jack, he sees that Jack's actions have drawn nationwide media attention whom hail Jack Issel as an honest businessman. Helmes changes his mind about firing Jack and invites him to his house that weekend where Jack runs into Rachel again and finally learns that she is Helmes' daughter. Helmes tries to win over Jack's loyalty to I.N.C. by inviting him to a dinner reception at the council offices of a fictitious Latin American country of San Marcos where a dinner reception is taking place where Jack is expected to give a $2 million bribe to a political rival of the San Marcos dictator General Sanchez (John Kapelos) as another I.N.C. ploy to win the support of the dictatorship government for further business purposes. At the reception, Jack sneaks Rachel into the building where they finally learn the truth about Helmes plans for Jack, as well as his plans for I.N.C.'s business with the country of San Marcos. Stealing the suitcase with the $2 million cash-bribe money, Jack and Rachel flee from the building security forces in a climatic chase and escape from the building and expose I.N.C.'s plans to the press. As a result, the textile plant in Allenville is saved, Pete Helmes is forced to resign from I.N.C. in disgrace, and Jack and Rachel both inherit the majority of I.N.C. stockholder shares. The final scene has Jack, now the new chairman of the board at I.N.C., traveling in Pete Helmes helicopter, to the offices with Sal as his pilot.

Reception =Critical response= Reinhold later said the film had \\"a good script, but things didn't work out at the old box office.\\"http://newsok.com/article/2155542 Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote in her review: \\"Head Office, which opened yesterday at the UA Twin and other theaters, has a droll tone that sets it well above comedy's lowest common denominator. But it also has a bloodlessness that keeps it from being funny very often. Ken Finkleman, the film's writer and director, has assembled an interesting cast and struck a note that might have been timely; though corporate satire has been out of vogue for a while, it's ready for a revival. But while Head Office has its moments, it winds up much too understated to have a cutting edge.\\" =Release= Head Office was released in theatres on December 29, 1985.

Seven March Violets singles reached the UK Indie Chart; the Natural History collection also was an indie hit (hitting No. 3 in 1984). History The March Violets formed in 1981, meeting at Leeds University. The original band members were Tom Ashton (guitar), Laurence \\"Loz\\" Elliot (bass), Simon \\"Detroit\\" Denbigh (vocals) and Rosie Garland (vocals). Percussion was provided by a drum machine, nicknamed \\"Dr. Rhythm\\", a feature they had in common with many of the bands in the Leeds scene at the time. Fellow student Andrew Eldritch, lead singer of the Sisters of Mercy, released the band's debut 7\\", the four-track \\"Religious as Hell\\" EP, on his Merciful Release label on 28 August 1982. A second single on Merciful Release, \\"Grooving in Green\\", followed on 27 November 1982. The band then established their own Rebirth record label, releasing the \\"Crow Baby\\" single on 30 April 1983. Cleo Murray joined as second female vocalist for the next single, \\"Snake Dance\\", issued in December 1983. The song was a club hit, and is considered a classic of the gothic rock genre. Garland left after \\"Snake Dance\\", and Murray took over as sole female singer for \\"Walk Into the Sun\\", issued 4 August 1984. That October, the band released their first compilation album, Natural History, which collected the first four singles plus two tracks from a 1983 BBC Peel Session. The March Violets shifted towards a more pop-oriented sound, and Denbigh left the band in early February 1985,The March Of Time. In: Sounds magazine, 16 February 1985, page 2. prior to the band's first American tour in March 1985. Denbigh did appear on the next single, \\"Deep\\", released 11 May 1985 but recorded prior to his departure. A second compilation album, Electric Shades, was issued in the US by Relativity Records that year; it collected the contents of the \\"Snake Dance\\", \\"Walk Into the Sun\\" and \\"Deep\\" singles, including a piano-laden remix of \\"Snake Dance\\". The band then signed to major label London Records, adding drummer Andy Tolson to the lineup. The \\"Turn to the Sky\\" single was released 24 February 1986 on London, although still bearing the Rebirth imprint. The song (and their cover of \\"Miss Amanda Jones\\" by the Rolling Stones) was featured on the soundtrack to the 1987 film Some Kind of Wonderful, which included a live performance by the band. They broke up later that year. In 1993, the band's first CD compilation, The Botanic Verses, was released by Jungle Records in the UK and Cleopatra Records in the US; it covered their entire 1982-1984 catalogue. Other projects Before the band's split, Ashton had guested as live guitarist for the Sisters of Mercy and the Danse Society. In 1991, he joined Clan of Xymox for their Phoenix US tour, and relocated there. He later composed indie film soundtracks. Murray briefly fronted the band Lovecraft in the early 1990s, releasing two 1993 singles, \\"Hungry\\" and \\"Medicine\\". Denbigh formed the Batfish Boys and D-Rok. Garland became a poet and cabaret performer, performing under the name Rosie Lugosi. Later, she was the victim of a stalker, with the 2007 court case featured as a lead article in the Manchester Evening News. Following several poetry collections, Garland's debut novel, The Palace of Curiosities, was published by HarperCollins in 2013, earning several awards and a longlisting for the Desmond Elliott Prize. Reformation and subsequent activity On 8 October 2007, The March Violets played a one-off reunion gig in Leeds with original members Denbigh, Garland and Ashton, plus Mat Thorpe (Isolation Division) standing in on bass. Although the show was a success, plans for further shows were put on hold during Garland's successful fight against throat cancer in 2009. Once Garland was fully recovered, the March Violets restarted their live reformation with a secret warm-up show at Whitby in October 2010. On 13 November 2010, the March Violets played their first London show in 25 years, at O2 Academy Islington with new bassist Joanna Moy (previously of Screaming Banshee Aircrew). In November 2010, the band embarked on a project to make their first proper album using Pledge Music (as opposed to the previous compilation albums of their singles and EPs). Over 600 fans pledged support and they raised 196% of the money required. In addition to raising money for the recording of the album, the band provided funds to charities (Friends of the Earth, Cloth Cat and Macmillan Cancer Support). During the recording of the album, they released several promotional items, including a digital-only promo release of \\"Tokyo Flow\\" and a remix of \\"Dandelion King\\", as well as a \\"gigeo\\" (a combination of a gig in Leeds where they shot the promo video with members of the audience) of \\"Dandelion King\\". In 2012, they did a small live tour that showcased some of the new tracks. The album Made Glorious was released in April 2013 as a digital download to all fans who had pledged support. The album primarily consisted of original tracks, with some material being remixes of tracks from the Trinity and Love Will Kill You EPs. Physical hard copies, T-shirts, an A4 booklet (featuring lyrics, artwork and photos) and posters were distributed to those who had pledged support in June 2013. Pledgers received a special 2CD pack featuring 12 additional remixes including two tracks not included on the original album (\\"Liam Hits Seven\\" and \\"Black Heart\\"). To support the new album, the band performed gigs in October and November 2013, and a short tour in April 2014, including a headlining slot at the Convergence 20 festival in Chicago, the first US appearance of the reformed lineup. This was followed by a return tour of the West Coast in June 2014. In August 2015, the band confirmed that Moy had officially left the band. The following month, they announced an American tour with William Faith on bass, scheduled for October. In early October, the band announced that after completing the Mortality tour, they would record a new album of the same name. It was funded via PledgeMusic and achieved 167% funding ‚Äì 10% of the funding going to Macmillan Cancer Support. The initial version of the Mortality album was released for download on Christmas Day to those who had supported its development. This version consisted of 10 tracks; all except the title track were \\"re-forged\\" versions of older songs. Mars Williams of the Psychedelic Furs provided additional saxophone on several tracks. The full version of the album, released in 2016, included additional remixes and extended versions. After releasing the first remix to pledgers in early 2016, Denbigh suffered a stroke and was hospitalised for a long period.

Retrieved on October 8, 2014. (less commonly, aspergilium or aspergil) is a liturgical implement used to sprinkle holy water. It comes in two common forms: a brush that is dipped in the water and shaken, and a silver ball on a stick. Some have sponges or internal reservoirs that dispense holy water when shaken, while others must periodically be dipped in an aspersorium (holy water bucket, known to art historians as a situla). Uses An aspergillum is used in Roman Catholic and Anglican ceremonies, including the Rite of Baptism and during the Easter Season. In addition, a priest will use the aspergillum to bless the candles during candlemas services and the palms during Palm Sunday Mass. At a requiem, if a coffin is present, the priest will sprinkle holy water on the coffin. The aspergillum can be used in other manners where sprinkling of holy water is appropriate, as in a house blessing, in which the priest might bless the entry to the home. The name derives from the Latin verb aspergere 'to sprinkle'. The form of the aspergillum differs in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Greek Orthodox Church the aspergillum (randistirion) is in the form of a standing vessel with a tapering lid. The top of the lid has holes in it from which the agiasmos (holy water) is sprinkled. In the Russian Orthodox Church the aspergillum is in the form of a whisk made of cloth or hair. Sometimes, sprigs of basil are used to sprinkle holy water. In some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, no aspergillum is used, but the priest will pour holy water into the palm of his right hand and throw it on the faithful. An aspergillum is also used in other religions, including Balinese Shaivism (Hinduism). Origin The origin is found in the Book of Leviticus Chapter 14 in the Old Testament‚Äì Proto-aspergillum as described in Leviticus > 3\\\\. ‚ÄòAnd the priest goes out of the camp and the priest looks, and beholds > that the sore of the leprosy of the leper is healed.‚Äô 4. ‚ÄòAnd the priest > commands, and takes, for the one healed, two unblemished live birds, cedar > wood, Coccus scarlet, and hyssop.‚Äô 5. ‚ÄòAnd the priest commands, and > slaughters the one bird in a pottery vessel upon living water.‚Äô 6. ‚ÄòHe takes > the live bird and the cedar wood and the Coccus scarlet and the hyssop and > dips them and the live bird in the blood of the bird slaughtered upon the > living water.‚Äô 7. ‚ÄòAnd sprinkle seven times upon him purified of leprosy, > and he is purified, and sends the live bird upon the face of the field.' Adam Clarke's commentary: Of the cedar wood, hyssop, clean bird, and scarlet wool or fillet, were made an aspergillum, or instrument to sprinkle with. The cedarwood served for the handle, the hyssop and living bird were attached to it, by means of the scarlet wool or crimson fillet. The bird was so bound to this handle, as that its tail should be downwards, in order to be dipped in the blood of the bird that had been killed. The whole of this made an instrument for the sprinkling of this blood, and when this business was done, the living bird was let loose, and permitted to go whithersoever it would. (Adam Clarke, 1831, vol. I p. 52) Clarke again, of Verse 5. Over running water ‚Äì Literally \\"living\\", that is, spring water. The meaning appears to be this; some water (about a quarter of a log, an egg shell and half full, according to the rabbis) was taken from a spring, and put in a clean earthen vessel, and they killed the bird over this water, that the blood might drop into it... (A. C. I p. 529) Further, these ceremonies conducted by the priest did not cure skin disease. According to Luke, the diseased person came to the priest after he had been healed (Luke 5:14). The task of the priest was to make the person who had been excluded from the camp, from his people, and from God, ceremonially clean. Through these ceremonial cleansings, which took place in two stages, a week apart, the diseased individual was restored to fellowship with God and with His people.Reformation Study Bible The procedure was a first stage of cleansing which took place outside the camp. The man washed himself and his clothes, and shaved. Two birds were taken. The blood of one was used to purify the man. The death of that bird portrayed the end of the man's old life outside the camp, and the flight to freedom of the other pictured his liberation from the effects of the disease. Then the man might enter the camp again.\\" Other uses Aspergilla are also used in modern paganism, particularly to cleanse a ritual area in Wicca, as part of a spell, or during a Wheel of the Year festival in contemporary Witchcraft. Lunarized water, saltwater, or rainwater are most typically used. Aspergillus, a genus of mold, was named in 1729 by the Italian priest and biologist Pietro Antonio Micheli. When viewed under a microscope, the mold cells were said to resemble an aspergillum.

Biography Kuniyoshi was born on September 1, 1889 in Okayama, Japan. He immigrated to the United States in 1906, choosing not to attend military school in Japan.Tatham (2006), p.99 Kuniyoshi originally intended to study English and return to Japan to work as a translator. He spent some time in Seattle, before enrolling at the Los Angeles School of Art and Design.Tatham (2006), p.100 Kuniyoshi spent three years in Los Angeles, discovering his love for the arts. He then moved to New York City to pursue an art career. Kuniyoshi studied briefly at the National Academy and at the Independent School in New York City, and then studied under Kenneth Hayes Miller at the Art Students League of New York. He married his first wife Katherine Schmidt, who in 1919 lost her American citizenship due to her relationship with Kuniyoshi who was ineligible for American citizenship. He later taught at the Art Students League of New York in New York City and in Woodstock, New York. Nan Lurie was among his students, as was Irene Krugman. Around 1930, the artist built a home and studio on Ohayo Mountain Road in Woodstock. He was an active member of the artistic community there for the rest of his life.Bloodgood, Josephine, At Woodstock, Kuniyoshi (Woodstock, NY: Woodstock Artists Association, 2003), pp.10-29. One of his pupils from the League, Anne Helioff, would go on to work with him at Woodstock. Although viewed as an immigrant, Kuniyoshi was very patriotic and identified himself as an American. He never received his citizenship due to harsh immigration laws. During World War II, he proclaimed his loyalty and patriotism as a propaganda artist for the United States. This included a number of anti-Japanese propaganda posters. In 1935, Kuniyoshi was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship.http://www.gf.org/fellows/8250-yasuo-kuniyoshi He was also an Honorary member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and first president of Artists Equity Association, now known as New York Artists Equity Association.Sokol, David M. \\"The Founding of Artists Equity Association after World War II.\\" Archives of American Art Journal 39, no. 1/2 (1999): 17-29. In 1948, Kuniyoshi became the first living artist chosen to have a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1952, Kuniyoshi also exhibited at the Venice Biennial. In the early 1950s, Kuniyoshi became sick with cancer, and ended his career as an artist with a series of black-and- white drawings using sumi-e ink. He died on 14 May 1953. Art =Printmaking= Kenneth Hayes Miller introduced Kuniyoshi to intaglio printmaking; he made approximately 45 such prints between 1916 and 1918. In 1922, Kuniyolshi learned about zinc plate lithography and adopted the technique.Tatham (2006), p.100-102 =Painting= Strong Woman and Child (1925), Smithsonian American Art Museum Kuniyoshi was also known for his still-life paintings of common objects, and figurative subjects like female circus performers and nudes. Throughout Kuniyoshi's career he had frequent changes in his technique and subject matter. In the 1920s, Kuniyoshi painted images that were more angular, somewhat Cubist in style and with a tilted plane that allowed him to paint the most detail for each object in his paintings. Kuniyoshi's application of Cubism's angularity can be seen in his painting titled Little Joe with Cow (1923). In these early paintings, Kuniyoshi was painting from a combination of his memory and imagination, which is a Japanese mode of thinking about painting. Instead of painting from life, as in Western painting, traditional Japanese painters typically paint their ideal image of a particular subject. Kuniyoshi combined this with Western painting in the way he applies the bold colors in oil on canvas;Wolf, Tom. Yasuo Kuniyoshi's Women. Whitney Museum of American Art, 1948. VI-VII. in Japan, traditional painters use ink on either silk or rice paper. These early paintings are the precursors to his mature style that we see in the 1930s. In 1925, Kuniyoshi painted his Circus Girl Resting, after a visit to Paris. He painted a provocative woman of larger proportions, similar to Strong Woman and Child. This painting was purchased and included in the Advancing American Art Exhibition by the US Department of State alongside other well known modern artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Edward Hopper. Due to that era's aversion to modern art, it was closed down. Kuniyoshi's Circus Girl Resting received harsh criticism from President Harry Truman because of its exotic proportions, not because of its provocative nature. Dream (1922), Bridgestone Museum of Art, Tokyo In the 1930s Kuniyoshi switched from painting from memory to painting from life. This change occurred after his two trips to Europe in 1925 and 1928, where he was exposed to French modern art. In 1928, Goodrich notes, Kuniyoshi spent most of his time in Paris with his friend Jules Pascin, and it was on this later trip that Kuniyoshi realized that his art had grown stale.Goodrich, Lloyd. Yasuo Kuniyoshi: Retrospective Exhibition March 27 to May 9, 1948. Pomegranate Artbooks, 1993. 25‚Äì26. By switching to painting from life and incorporating perspective into his paintings, he was able to breathe life back into his images; the change in his style can be seen in Daily News (1935). In this painting it appears that the woman, who is seated in a chair, occupies space within the room depicted as opposed to appearing flat as in Little Joe with Cow. The sharp angles in the cow painting are gone in his painting of the woman, but the soft line work and bold use of colors are apparent in both images. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Kuniyoshi's \\"Artificial Flowers and Other Things\\" appeared in the Whitney Museum's \\"Second Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting,\\" which ran from November 27, 1934, to January 10, 1935, and included the work of one other Japanese-American artist, Hideo Noda. Even in his images of women where they are full-bodied and seem to have a presence in the painting, such as the woman in Daily News, Kuniyoshi did not entirely throw out painting from memory. Goodrich points out that Kuniyoshi did not work with models for the entire painting process. Rather, the artist drew from the model in the early stages of a painting but eventually stopped using her after about a week or so, and then would continue on from his memory, making adjustments as he saw fit.Goodrich. Yasuo Kuniyoshi: Retrospective Exhibition March 27 to May 9, 1948. 32‚Äì34. This desire to paint the ideal perfection of a subject was favored in Japanese art, whereas in Western traditions the painting is typically informed by the real object throughout the entire painting process.

The investigation then centers around a certain Von Greis, an aristocrat collecting blackmail material on important personalities for Hermann G√∂ring, which Goering uses for political means. During the investigation G√ºnther meets Inge Lorenz, who becomes his assistant and, eventually, romantic interest. With Inge, G√ºnther follows various clues to try to find Kurt Mutschmann, the criminal who allegedly cracked the safe of the Pfarr house. This leads them to a dilapidated pension where they find Von Greis's decaying body. Eventually they learn that Mutschmann did the robbery for \\"Red\\" Dieter, head of the German Strength crime syndicate. G√ºnther then meets Paul's assistant, Marlene Sahm, at the Reich Sports Field during races that are part of the 1936 Olympic games. From Sahm, G√ºnther learns that Paul had discovered Six was corrupt and was about to indict him. To do that, he tried to convince Von Greis to release what he had on Six, but Von Greis refused, so Paul got the Gestapo to obtain the documents for him. Von Greis later was killed by Dieter's men. Following his meeting with Sahm, G√ºnter takes a taxi to Haupth√§ndler's beach house. There he sees Haupth√§ndler, Jeschonnek, and a woman, and confronts them. In the scuffle he kills Jeschonnek and knocks out Haupth√§ndler and the woman, but is then knocked out himself by an assailant from Dieter's crew. In the meantime, Inge disappears. Once recovered from the beach house event, G√ºnter goes to Six's place to get answers to some pending questions. Six tries to pay to get him off the case, but G√ºnther confronts him with the facts at his disposal. During the exchange G√ºnther realizes that the woman he saw at Haupth√§ndler's beach house was Six's daughter, not Paul's girlfriend. It turns out Grete Pfarr, Six's daughter, had killed her husband and his mistress and, with the help of Haupth√§ndler, stole the necklace to generate some cash for an escape, then burned down the house. But by then the safe had already been deprived of the papers by Mutschmann, and their theft of the necklace just made Red Dieter look bad to his employer, Hermann Six. Six comes to the terrible realization that Red Dieter holds his daughter and Haupth√§ndler, and he and G√ºnter retrieve a motor boat to go to the headquarters of the German Strength ring. At the German Strength headquarters, Six and G√ºnther explain the case to Red Dieter, who helps them retrieve Haupth√§ndler and Grete, who were being tortured based on the false belief that they must know the location of the von Greis papers since they have the necklace which was in the safe with the papers. In retrieving the two prisoners, Red Dieter has to shoot one of his own surly men and things heat up. G√ºnther tries to escape from the island with Grete in a boat but they are intercepted by a Gestapo raid. In the action, Grete catches a stray bullet and dies. G√ºnther awakens to find out he has been taken in by the Gestapo and he is left to rot in a cell for a week. Eventually, a top Gestapo officer, Reinhard Heydrich, forces him to agree to go to the Dachau concentration camp to try to covertly befriend Mutschmann, who is a prisoner there, and obtain from him the location of the Von Greis papers. G√ºnther is sent to Dachau and has various unfortunate camp experiences there, which land him at the hospital. In the hospital he discovers Mutschmann, who is dying of hepatitis. In the end Mutschmann yields the location of the papers before dying. It is implied that G√ºnther gives the papers to the Gestapo, who let him go. He never finds Inge. Major themes The major themes of the novel include corruption among the civil servants of the Third Reich, the everyday violence and anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime and the inability or unwillingness of ordinary Germans to act in the face of the coming war. = Historical elements = Although most of the characters are fictitious, the novel's plot also involves historical figures, including Goering, Himmler, Heydrich, Arthur Nebe, and Walther Funk. A scene in Chapter 15 takes place at the Reich Sports Field during an Olympic track and field event in which Jesse Owens participates. Many place names of 1936 Berlin are referred to. However, an anachronism is present in Chapter 7, where Kerr refers to a street on the edge the Dahlem section of Berlin as \\"Clayallee\\". This street, originally Kronprinzenallee, was renamed in 1949 in honor of the American General Lucius D. Clay, Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone and organizer of the Berlin Airlift in relief of the Soviet blockade of West Berlin. In chapter 11, the reference to Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring is inaccurate since this corporate entity was created only in July 1937.

Owned by Harvard Broadcasting, CKRM broadcasts a full service country music format. Alongside music programming, CKRM is notably the flagship station of the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League, and the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League.  History  CKRM was established in 1926 in Moose Jaw under the call letters CJRM.Historical information on CJRM-AM (1926-1940) at Canadian Communications Foundation Its original owner was the Winnipeg, Manitoba grain merchant James Richardson and Sons. In 1928, the Richardsons opened CJRW in Winnipeg and networked their two stations. CJRM opened a studio in Regina in 1933, and by 1935 all station operations were based in Regina. The stations were purchased by the Sifton family, owners of the Regina Leader-Post and CKCK Radio in 1940, and CJRM became CKRM. In 1944, CKRM affiliated with the CBC's Dominion Network until 1962 when the network was disbanded and CKRM became independent. In late 1971, CKRM dropped its easy listening format and became a country music station. In 2001, the station would relocate from 980 AM to 620 AM, shortly after the original CKCK radio closed down.Decision CRTC 2001-739 CJME, formerly at 1300 AM, moved to CKRM's former frequency. The move gave CKRM access to the second-most powerful transmitting facility in Saskatchewan, and one of the largest coverage areas in North America. Due to its location on the lower end of the AM dial, transmitter power, and Saskatchewan's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), CKRM's daytime signal covers most of Saskatchewan's densely populated area, as well as parts of North Dakota and Montana. CKRM changed hands a number of times before its acquisition by Regina's Hill family, then- owners of CKCK-TV in 1981, under the Harvard Broadcasting banner. By this time the station's country format had become quite popular. CKRM also acquired the radio rights to the Western Hockey League's Regina Pats, and the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.

The bay constitutes a wide southeastern inlet of Baffin Bay.  Geography  To the south the coastline is complicated with multiple waterways of skerries and small islands in the Aasiaat archipelago. Qasigiannguit and Ilimanaq are the main settlements in the southeastern inlet, just south of the outflow of Ilulissat Icefjord. From the north the bay is bounded by Qeqertarsuaq, the largest island on the western coast.

File:Disko- bay.jpgGrowlers and bergy bits float in the bay all year round File:The Disko Bay Qeqertarsuaq greenland.jpgIlulissat/Jakobshavn  History  Disko Bay has been an important location for centuries. Its coastline was first encountered by Europeans when Erik the Red started a settlement in 985 AD on the more habitable western coast of Greenland. The two settlements, called the Eastern and Western settlements, were sustenance economies that survived on animal husbandry and farming. Soon after the Western settlement was established, the Norsemen travelled up the coast during the summer thaw and discovered Disko Bay. Their interest in this bay was due to its rich resources: walruses for ivory, seals for their pelts, and whales for a variety of materials. These products became the main source of income for the Greenlandic settlers who traded with Iceland, the British Isles, and mainland Europe. Without these resources the settlements would probably not have lasted as long as they did. It is uncertain when the Inuit first started venturing into Disko Bay, but the Saqqaq were present there between 2400‚Äì900 BC. Norse accounts describe the area as uninhabited when they first explored it. Norse accounts document an eventual trade arrangement with the Inuit who came from the north and west. For a time, both parties made peaceful use of the bay. Later accounts report fighting and massacres on both sides. However, the primary reason for the abandonment of the Greenlandic settlements was the advent of the Little Ice Age that started in the 15th century. There was such an extreme shift in temperature that Disko Bay became inaccessible even in the warmer summer months, thereby destroying the livelihood of the Greenlandic Norse. Even the Eastern settlement, which was below the Arctic Circle, became too cold for habitation. From that time until Danish colonization in the 18th century, the Inuit controlled the Disko Bay area although English and Dutch whalers sometimes visited the area after it was charted during John Davis's third Greenland expedition in 1587. Wildlife It is home to a wide range of species due to the nutrient-rich waters. This includes benthic and pelagic fish, such as capelin (Mallotus villosus) and cod (Gadus morhua). This attracts migratory seals such as harp (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) and ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus). The bay is home during spring time to bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales, as well as Pilot (Globicephala melas), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros). On the shores, various birds can be found such as gulls, terns, eider ducks, guillemots, kittiwakes, cormorants and fulmars. Animals such as Arctic foxes, hares and ptarmigan can be found around the bay.

The name of the plan comes from the name of the currency which was chosen to give the idea of a stable and credible purchasing power. in English) was a set of measures taken to stabilize the Brazilian economy in 1994, during the presidency of Itamar Franco. Its architects were led by the Minister of Finance and succeeding president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The Plano Real was based on an analysis of the root causes of hyperinflation in the New Republic of Brazil, that concluded that there was both an issue of fiscal policy and severe, widespread inertial inflation. The Plano Real intended to stabilize the domestic currency in nominal terms after a string of failed plans to control inflation. Background According to economic academics, one of the causes of inflation in Brazil was the inertial inflation phenomenon. Prices were adjusted on a daily basis according to changes in price indices and to the exchange rate of the local currency to the U.S. dollar. Plano Real then created a non-monetary currency, the Unidade Real de Valor (\\"URV\\"), whose value was set to approximately 1 US dollar. All prices were quoted in these two currencies, cruzeiro real and URV, but payments had to be made exclusively in cruzeiros reais. Prices quoted in URV did not change over time, while their equivalent in cruzeiros reals increased nominally every day. Solution The Plano Real intended to stabilize the domestic currency in nominal terms after a string of failed plans to control inflation. It created the Unidade Real de Valor (Unit of Real Value), which served as a key step to the implementation of the new (and still current) currency, the real. At first, most academics tended not to believe that the Plan could succeed. Stephen Kanitz was the first public intellectual to predict the future success of the Real Plan. A new currency called the real (plural reais) was introduced on 1 July 1994, as part of a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, substituting the short-lived cruzeiro real in the process. Then, a series of contracting fiscal and monetary policies was enacted, restricting the government expenses and raising interest rates. By doing so, the country was able to keep inflation under control for several years. In addition, high interest rates attracted enough foreign capital to finance the current account deficit and increased the country's international reserves. The government put a strong focus on the management of the balance of payments, at first by setting the real at a very high value relative to the U.S. dollar, and later (in late 1998) by a sharp increase on domestic interest rates to maintain a positive influx of foreign capitals to local currency bond markets, financing Brazilian expenditures. Result The real initially appreciated (gained value) against the U.S. dollar as a result of large capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995. It then began a gradual depreciation process, culminating in the 1999 January currency crisis, when the real suffered a maxi-devaluation, and fluctuated wildly. Following this period (1994‚Äì1999) of a quasi-fixed exchange rate, an inflation-targeting policy was instituted by new central bank president Arminio Fraga, which effectively meant that the fixed-exchange period was over. However, the currency was never truly \\"free\\", being more accurately described as a managed or \\"dirty\\" float, with frequent central bank interventions to manipulate its dollar price. The currency's appreciation was crucial to keep inflation under control. Mainly, it assured the supply of cheap imported products to meet the domestic demand and forced domestic producers to sell at lower prices in order to maintain their market shares. This was especially important in the period immediately following the adoption of the new currency, when the sudden drop in inflation caused a surge in demand. The increased imports, therefore, were essential to avoid demand-side inflationary pressures that would undermine the stabilization plan.

It is used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) including during pregnancy and following certain types of surgery. It is also used in those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart attacks. It is given by injection just under the skin or into a vein. It is also used during hemodialysis. Common side effects include bleeding, fever, and swelling of the legs. Bleeding may be serious especially in those who are undergoing a spinal tap. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby. Enoxaparin is in the low molecular weight heparin family of medications. Enoxaparin was first made in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Enoxaparin is sold under several brand names and is available as a generic medication. Enoxaparin is made from heparin. In 2017, it was the 299th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses * Treatment of unstable angina (UA) and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), administered concurrently with aspirin * DVT prophylaxis in knee replacement surgery * DVT prophylaxis in hip replacement surgery * DVT prophylaxis in abdominal surgery * Treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism * Treatment of DVT inpatient, with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) =Monitoring= Enoxaparin has predictable absorption, bioavailability, and distribution therefore monitoring is not typically done. However, there are instances where monitoring may be beneficial for special populations, for example individuals with kidney insufficiency or those that are obese. In this case, anti-Xa units can be measured and dosing adjusted accordingly. =Reversal agent= Protamine sulfate is less effective at reversing enoxaparin compared to heparin, with a maximum neutralization of approximately 60% of the anti-factor Xa effect. =Pregnancy= *Enoxaparin is a FDA pregnancy category B drug which means enoxaparin is not expected to cause harm to an unborn baby when used during pregnancy. This statement is based on reproductive studies involving pregnant rats and rabbits. No birth defects or toxic effects to an unborn fetus due to enoxaparin were observed during these animals studies. However a human's response to enoxaparin might be different than that of a small animal, therefore enoxaparin should be used during pregnancy only if there is a definite need. * Enoxaparin does not cross the placenta therefore it is unlikely an unborn baby would be exposed to it. * Some fetal deaths have been reported by women who used enoxaparin during pregnancy, but it is unclear if enoxaparin caused these deaths. * Pregnant woman on enoxaparin should be monitored on a regular basis for bleeding and/or \\"excessive anticoagulation\\" especially when the delivery date is approaching. The risk of hemorrhage is higher during delivery if the person is still using enoxaparin and this could endanger the life of the baby and/or the mother. * The multiple-dose vials of the brand name enoxaparin (Lovenox) contain 15 mg benzyl alcohol per 1 mL as a preservative. Premature infants who have been given large amounts of benzyl alcohol (99‚Äì405 mg/kg/day) have experienced \\"gasping syndrome\\". * Although enoxaparin is used to prevent blood clots it is necessary to remember that pregnancy alone can raise a woman's risk of clotting. Side effects Uncommon (<1%) * In people with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction: ** Atrial fibrillation, heart failure, lung edema, pneumonia: ‚â• 0.5%v Common (>1%) * Thrombocytopenia, i.e. can be associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (0.5-5.0% of persons treated for at least five days) * Elevations in serum aminotransferases: 5.9%-6.1% * In people undergoing abdominal or colorectal surgery: ** Bleeding, anemia, ecchymosis: ‚â• 2% * In persons undergoing hip or knee replacement: ** Fever, nausea, anemia, edema, peripheral edema: ‚â• 2% * In persons with severely restricted mobility during acute illness: ** Dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, confusion, diarrhea, nausea: ‚â• 2% * In people being treated for deep vein thrombosis: ** Injection site hemorrhage, injection site pain, hematuria: ‚â• 2% Frequency under investigation * Local reactions: local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, erythema * Bleeding * Hyperkalemia * Transaminitis * Hemorrhage = Boxed warning = The FDA issued a revision to the boxed warning for enoxaparin in October 2013. The revision recommends exercising caution regarding when spinal catheters are placed and removed in persons taking enoxaparin for spinal puncture or neuroaxial anesthesia. It may be necessary to delay anticoagulant dosing in these persons in order to decrease the risk for spinal or epidural hematomas, which can manifest as permanent or long-term paralysis. Persons at risk for hematomas may present with indwelling epidural catheters, concurrent use of medications that worsen bleeding states such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or a past medical history of epidural or spinal punctures, spinal injury, or spinal deformations. The FDA recommends that at-risk persons be monitored for bleeding and neurological changes.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Enoxaparin binds to and potentiates antithrombin (a circulating anticoagulant) to form a complex that irreversibly inactivates clotting factor Xa. It has less activity against factor IIa (thrombin) compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its low molecular weight.Trevor, Anthony J., Bertram G. Katzung, and Susan B. Masters. Basic & clinical pharmacology. McGraw-Hill Medical, 2012. = Pharmacokinetics = Absorption: Bioavailability (subcutaneous injection) ~ 100% Distribution: Volume of distribution (anti-Factor Xa activity) = 4.3 liters Metabolism: Enoxaparin is metabolized in the liver into low molecular weight species by either or both desulfation and depolymerization. Elimination: A single dose of a subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin has an elimination half-life of 4.5 hours. Approximately 10‚Äì40% of the active and inactive fragments from a single dose are excreted by the kidneys. Dose adjustments based on kidney function are necessary in persons with reduced kidney function. =Drug class= Enoxaparin belongs to the class of drugs known as low molecular weight heparins. Other drugs in this class include dalteparin, fondaparinux and tinzaparin. Biosimilars In September 2016, Inhixa and Thorinane were approved for use in the European Union.> Thorinane was withdrawn from the market in October 2019. In March 2017, Enoxaparin BECAT, Laboratorios ROVI (Spain) obtained marketing authorization in twenty six countries in Europe. The product is now available in Europe.

At the Queens-Nassau border, it becomes the Northern State Parkway, which runs across the northern part of Long Island through Nassau County and into Suffolk County, where it ends in Hauppauge. The westernmost stretch (from the Triborough Bridge to exit 4) also carries a short stretch of Interstate 278 (I-278). The parkway runs through Queens and passes the Cross Island Parkway, Long Island Expressway, LaGuardia Airport and Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. The parkway is designated New York State Route 907M (NY 907M), an unsigned reference route. Despite its name, the Grand Central Parkway was not named after Grand Central Terminal. The Grand Central Parkway has a few unique distinctions. It is only one of two parkways in New York State to carry an elliptical black-on-white design for its trailblazer, the other being the Henry Hudson Parkway, also in New York City. Other parkways in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island use the state-standard design, while the Belt- system parkways use a modified version of the Long Island regional parkway shield with the Montauk Point Lighthouse logo. In addition, it is one of the few parkways in the state to allow truck traffic to any extent. The section shared with I-278 allows for all trucks under high.  Route description  I-278 in Astoria, as seen facing the BMT Astoria Line The Grand Central Parkway begins at exit 44 off eastbound I-278 (the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway) in the Astoria section of Queens. This is formerly Exit 3 of the Grand Central Parkway, but exit numbers were changed in the early 2000s to coincide with I-278's numbering scheme. Therefore, Exits 1 (RFK, then Triborough Bridge) and Exit 2 (Randalls Island) were also eliminated and became Exits 46 & 46A respectively. However, Exit 46A is only signed in the I-278 westbound direction (I-278 eastbound only exits to Manhattan and Randalls Island as a combined Exit 46). It is also noteworthy that geographically, I-278 runs North-South over the RFK Bridge, but has a cardinal direction of Eastbound toward the Bronx, and Westbound toward Queens, as I-278 continues in a cardinally \\"westerly\\" direction as it heads toward Brooklyn, Staten Island, and New Jersey. Incidentally, the short overlap portion of the Grand Central Parkway in Astoria is signed I-278 East/ GCP West in the Manhattan-bound direction (and vice versa in the Queens-bound direction). The leg of the RFK Bridge that connects Randalls Island with Manhattan Island is NYS Reference Route 900G. The parkway proceeds east past St. Michaels Cemetery, entering exit 5, which serves 82nd Street and Astoria Boulevard in East Elmhurst, also connecting to the Marine Air Terminal and Terminal A of LaGuardia Airport. After crossing over 82nd Street and Ditmars Boulevard, the parkway enters the airport area, passing south of runway 4-22. During the reconstruction of the LaGuardia terminals, construction has been heavy in the vicinity of exits 6 and 7. As currently configured, eastbound exit 6 is an interchange with 94th Street while exit 7 forks northward on a ramp to the airport's terminals B, C and D. On the westbound side, exit 7 provides access to terminals C and D while exit 6 serves terminal B (in addition to 94th Street). After exit 7, the Grand Central bends southeast and away from LaGuardia Airport, paralleling the Long Island Sound into the eastbound only exit 8, which serves 111th Street. Entering the Corona section of Queens, the Grand Central enters exit 9, which serves NY 25A (Northern Boulevard) just west of Citi Field. The Grand Central then proceeds south, crossing under the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch and soon into Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Through the park, the parkway passes west of Arthur Ashe Stadium, the Queens Zoo and the Unisphere before entering exit 10, a cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). Soon crossing into Forest Hills, the parkway continues through Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, passing Meadow Lake, entering exit 11, connecting to 69th Road and Jewel Avenue in [in Forest Hills]. After that interchange, the parkway bends southeast through Forest Hills, passing Willow Lake and exit 12, which connects to NY 25 (Queens Boulevard) via 78th Avenue. Passing under Union Turnpike The Grand Central continues its bend, now proceeding eastward over Jamaica Yard, entering the Kew Gardens Interchange (exits 13, 14 and 15), connecting I-678 (the Van Wyck Expressway), Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway in Kew Gardens. After the Kew Gardens Interchange, the Grand Central Parkway continues east into the Briarwood section of Queens, where exit 16 connects to Parsons Boulevard via a service road. After crossing through the developed neighborhood of Briarwood, the parkway enters Jamaica Hills, passing south of Queens Hospital near 164th Street. Proceeding westbound, an exit (exit 17) is present, connecting to 168th Street, while eastbound, exit 18 connects the Grand Central to Utopia Parkway. Depressed section through Jamaica At the interchange with Utopia Parkway, the Grand Central passes south of St. John's University, soon winding northeast into exit 19, which serves 188th Street in Jamaica Estates. After exit 19, the parkway winds eastward into Cunningham Park, where it enters exit 20, which serves Francis Lewis Boulevard and exit 21, which connects to the Clearview Expressway (I-295) and its southern terminus. The parkway leaves Cunningham Park, entering the Bellerose section of Queens, entering exit 22, which connects to Union Turnpike via Stronghurst Avenue. The route then enters Alley Pond Park, where it interchanges with the Cross Island Parkway and Winchester Boulevard. After the interchange, the Grand Central passes west of Creedmoor Hospital, winding northeast into exit 24, which serves Little Neck Parkway before winding northeast to the Nassau County line in Little Neck. At this crossing, the parkway changes names to the Northern State Parkway, which continues east towards Hauppauge. History The Grand Central Parkway was first proposed in 1922, as a scenic drive along the high ground of east- central Queens. By the time construction began in 1931, it had been reconceived as extending northwestward to the Triborough Bridge, then in the planning stages, and connecting on the east with the Northern State Parkway, also in the planning stages, thereby among other things providing an easier route from the bridge to Jones Beach.The parkway was widened in 1961 in preparation for the 1964 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Formerly, the frontage road of the Grand Central between BQE and the RFK Bridge served as a truck route, since large trucks are not permitted on the parkway. Exemptions are provided for smaller trucks that conform with strict regulations, but only on the section of the Grand Central that overlaps with I-278. In December 2017, the state concluded a $2.5 million project that lowered the roadbed of the section of the parkway that is concurrent with I-278. This section of I-278 now has a vertical clearance, which allows most trucks to stay on I-278.

It is the highest pond in the state. It is often cited as the highest source of the Hudson River, via Feldspar Brook, the Opalescent River and Calamity Brook. The Hudson River as named actually begins several miles southwest at the outlet of Henderson Lake in Newcomb, New York. In 1872 Verplanck Colvin described the lake as part of a survey of the Adirondack Mountains. He wrote: On September 14, 1901, then-US Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was at Lake Tear of the Clouds after returning from a hike to the Mount Marcy summit when he received a message informing him that President William McKinley, who had been shot two weeks earlier but was expected to survive, had taken a turn for the worse. Roosevelt hiked down the mountain back to the Upper Tahawus Club, Tahawus, New York, where he had been staying. He then took a midnight stage coach ride through the Adirondacks to the Adirondack Railway station at North Creek, New York, where he discovered that McKinley had died. Roosevelt took the train to Buffalo, New York, where he was officially sworn in as President. The route is now designated the Roosevelt- Marcy Trail. In August 2016, scientists from Riverkeeper, CUNY Queens College, and Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory gathered water samples at the lake to complete a first-of-its kind water quality test along the entire span of the Hudson River.

Although the village is not tracked by the Census Bureau, it has been assigned the ZIP code 15635. The village was founded in 1773 as the seat of the newly created Westmoreland County, and was known at the time as \\"Hanna's Town\\". It was located along Forbes Road, the main route into the Ohio Country from eastern Pennsylvania, and named for Robert Hanna, an early settler whose tavern also served as Westmoreland County's first courthouse. Hannastown was settled primarily by Irish and Scotch-Irish, though the surrounding area was mostly Pennsylvania Dutch. On July 13, 1782, in one of the final actions of the American Revolutionary War, the settlement was attacked and destroyed by a British military detachment from Fort Niagara and British-allied American Indians led by Guyasuta. The county government was moved to Newtown, which later became known as Greensburg. The village was rebuilt, but after Forbes Road was rerouted through Greensburg, the settlement grew little, and eventually most of it became farmland. In 1899 the Jamison Coal & Coke Company opened a shaft-entry coal mine at Hannastown. The site (known as No. 2) also had a coke works and nearly 80 company-built houses for employees. It was served by the Alexandria branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Production at the mine peaked in the 1910s, when the site employed as many as 635 people. It ceased operations in 1949. Historic Hanna's Town In recent decades, what was known as Hanna's Town in the 1700s has been excavated, extensively restored and rebuilt. Currently, the Historic Hanna's Town site includes the reconstructed Hanna Tavern/Courthouse, three vintage late 18th century log houses, a reconstruction of the Revolutionary-era fort and blockhouse, and a wagon shed housing an authentic late 18th century Conestoga wagon. The site is maintained and opened to the public by the Westmoreland County Historical Society and the Westmoreland County Parks and Recreation Department.

The term is primarily used in the United States. In the past, the equivalent term was general practitioner in the US; that is still the term in the United Kingdom (and in many other countries). All physicians first complete medical school (MD, MBBS, or DO). To become primary care physicians, medical school graduates then undertake postgraduate training in primary care programs, such as family medicine (also called family practice or general practice in some countries), pediatrics or internal medicine. Some HMOs consider gynecologists as PCPs for the care of women and have allowed certain subspecialists to assume PCP responsibilities for selected patient types, such as allergists caring for people with asthma and nephrologists acting as PCPs for patients on kidney dialysis. Emergency physicians are sometimes counted as primary care physicians. Emergency physicians see many primary care cases, but in contrast to family physicians, pediatricians and internists, they are trained and organized to focus on episodic care, acute intervention, stabilization, and discharge or transfer or referral to definitive care, with less of a focus on chronic conditions and limited provision for continuing care. Scope of practice A set of skills and scope of practice may define a primary care physician, generally including basic diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses and medical conditions. Diagnostic techniques include interviewing the patient to collect information on the present symptoms, prior medical history and other health details, followed by a physical examination. Many PCPs are trained in basic medical testing, such as interpreting results of blood or other patient samples, electrocardiograms, or x-rays. More complex and time-intensive diagnostic procedures are usually obtained by referral to specialists, with special training with a technology or increased experience and patient volume that make a risky procedure safer for the patient. After collecting data, the PCP arrives at a differential diagnosis and, with the participation of the patient, formulates a plan including (if appropriate) components of further testing, specialist referral, medication, therapy, diet or life-style changes, patient education, and follow up results of treatment. Primary care physicians also counsel and educate patients on safe health behaviors, self-care skills and treatment options, and provide screening tests and immunizations. A recent United States survey, found that 45 percent of primary care doctors were contractually obligated to not inform patients when they moved on to another practice. This is a problem in rural areas, which may forbid doctors from setting up new or competing practices in areas where physicians are scarce. =Role in health care system= A primary care physician is usually the first medical practitioner contacted by a patient because of factors such as ease of communication, accessible location, familiarity, and increasingly issues of cost and managed care requirements. In many countries residents are registered as patients of a (local) doctor and must contact that doctor for referral to any other. They act as \\"gatekeepers\\", who regulate access to more costly procedures or specialists. Ideally, the primary care physician acts on behalf of the patient to collaborate with referral specialists, coordinate the care given by varied organizations such as hospitals or rehabilitation clinics, act as a comprehensive repository for the patient's records, and provide long-term management of chronic conditions. Continuous care is particularly important for patients with medical conditions that encompass multiple organ systems and require prolonged treatment and monitoring, such as diabetes and hypertension. Quality of care Studies that compare the knowledge base and quality of care provided by generalists versus specialists usually find that the specialists are more knowledgeable and provide better care. However, the studies examine the quality of care in the domain of the specialists. In addition, they need to account for clustering of patients and physicians. Studies of the quality of preventive health care find the opposite results: primary care physicians perform best. An analysis of elderly patients found that patients seeing generalists, as compared to patients seeing specialists, were more likely to receive influenza vaccination. In health promotion counseling, studies of self-reported behavior found that generalists were more likely than internal medicine specialists to counsel patients and to screen for breast cancer. Exceptions may be diseases that are so common that primary care physicians develop their own expertise. A study of patients with acute low back pain found the primary care physicians provided equivalent quality of care but at lower costs than orthopedic specialists. Factors associated with quality of care by primary care physicians: * The more experience the primary care physician has with a specific disease. * Physician group affiliation with networks of multiple groups. =Dissemination of information= The dissemination of information to generalists compared to specialists is complicated. PubMed Central Two studies found specialists were more likely to adopt COX-2 drugs before the drugs were recalled by the FDA. One of the studies went on to state \\"using COX-2s as a model for physician adoption of new therapeutic agents, specialists were more likely to use these new medications for patients likely to benefit but were also significantly more likely to use them for patients without a clear indication\\". Similarly, a separate study found that specialists were less discriminating in their choice of journal reading. Challenges =Declining numbers= In the United States, the number of medical students entering family practice training dropped by 50% between 1997 and 2005.American Academy of Family Physicians, National Resident Matching Program data: Family Medicine Residency Positions and Number Filled by U.S. Medical School Graduates, 1994-2006 Retrieved 30 August 2006 In 1998, half of internal medicine residents chose primary care, but by 2006, over 80% became specialists. A survey Research by the University of Missouri-Columbia (UMC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicts that by 2025 the United States will be short 35,000 to 44,000 adult care primary care physicians. Causes parallel the evolutionary changes occurring in the US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, most of which are handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening.Medical Group Management Association Physician Compensation Survey, 1998 - 2005: Median Compensation for Selected Medical Specialties Retrieved 30 August 2006 Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks. Maldistribution Developing countries face an even more critical disparity in primary care practitioners. The Pan American Health Organization reported in 2005 that \\"the Americas region has made important progress in health, but significant challenges and disparities remain. Among the most important is the need to extend quality health care to all sectors of the population.... Experience over the last 27 years shows that health systems that adhere to the principles of primary health care produce greater efficiency and better health outcomes in terms of both individual and public health.\\"Pan American Health Organization (September 2005): Regional Declaration on the New Orientations of Primary Health Care Retrieved 30 August 2006 The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified worsening trends in access to PCPs and other primary care workers, both in the developed and the developing nations:World Health Organization: World Health Report-2006 Retrieved 30 August 2006 *\\"Worker numbers and quality are positively associated with immunization coverage, outreach of primary care, and infant, child and maternal survival.\\" *\\"The quality of doctors and the density of their distribution have been shown to correlate with positive outcomes in cardiovascular diseases.\\" *\\"In health systems, (primary care) workers function as gatekeepers and navigators for the effective, or wasteful, application of all other resources such as drugs, vaccines and supplies.\\" *\\"There are currently 57 countries with critical shortages equivalent to a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses and midwives.\\" *\\"In many countries, the skills of limited yet expensive professionals are not well matched to the local profile of health needs.\\" *\\"...all countries suffer from maldistribution characterized by urban concentration and rural deficits.\\" *\\"Richer countries face a future of low fertility and large populations of elderly people, which will cause a shift towards chronic and degenerative diseases with high care demands.\\" *\\"Growing gaps will exert even greater pressure on the outflow of health workers from poorer regions.\\" =Lagging quality of care measures= A survey of 6,000 primary care doctors in seven countries revealed disparities in several areas that affect quality of care. Differences did not follow trends of the cost of care; primary care physicians in the United States lagged behind their counterparts in other countries, despite the fact that the US spends two to three times as much per capita. Arrangements for after-hours care were almost twice as common in the Netherlands, Germany and New Zealand as in Canada and the United States, where patients must rely on emergency facilities. Other major disparities include automated systems to remind patients about follow-up care, give patients test results or warn of harmful drug interactions. There were differences as well among primary care doctors, regarding financial incentives to improve the quality of care.

It was formerly known as the Rio del Norte. Being the largest river system in the state of Sonora, the Yaqui river is used for irrigation, especially in the Valle del Yaqui. The Rio Yaqui originates in the Sierra Madre Occidental at the junction of the Rio Bavispe and the Rio Aros at Lat. 29.529887 Long. ‚àí109.228377. It is approximately 320 km (200 mi) in length, and flows south and southwest into the Gulf of California near the city of Obregon. Its course is interrupted by several reservoirs like Plutarco El√≠as Calles (El Novillo), L√°zaro C√°rdenas (Angostura), or √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (El Ovi√°chic, Lake Ouiachic), which provides the water resource for the intensively irrigated region of Ciudad Obreg√≥n. Human history The Esperanza Stone. Found by Major Frederick Russell Burnham in the Yaqui Valley in 1908. Burnham left; Holder, rightAs early as the 6th century AD, native inhabitants known as the Yoem or Yaqui were living in family groups along the Rio Yaqui. The Yaqui used simple irrigation techniques to cultivate corn, beans, and squash while also hunting local game and gathering wild foods from the area. Yaquis traded native foods, furs, shells, salt, and other goods with many indigenous groups of central North America. The Yaquis lived more or less independently until the late 19th century, when many of them were driven from their lands surrounding the Rio Yaqui by the Mexican Army and forced to flee to more remote areas. Many Yaquis left the Rio Yaqui area to fight in the Vakatetteve Mountains, while others relocated to Yaqui communities in Arizona. By the late 1880s, warfare with the Mexican Army had killed off many members of the Yaqui tribe, so that only 4,000 Yaquis remained in the Rio Yaqui area. In the early 20th century, after a series of conflicts with the Mexican Army, many of the remaining Yaqui were arrested and dispersed to plantations in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The survivors continued resisting until the late 1920s, when Mexican authorities overcame resistance by employing heavy artillery and aircraft to bomb and shell Yaqui villages. Also in the early 20th century, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, a celebrated American scout, went to Mexico in search of mineral resources. While there he met the naturalist Dr. Charles Frederick Holder and the two men soon became associated with the early Yaqui River irrigation project. Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year-round water to rich alluvial soil in the valley; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity. He purchased water rights and some of land in this region and contacted an old friend from Africa, John Hays Hammond, who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional of this land‚Äîan area the size of Rhode Island. He became a close business associate of Hammond and led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by Hammond, J.P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, the onset of the Mexican Revolution frustrated their plans. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government. In his case study of Burnham's American colonization scheme, Professor Bradford concluded: \\"a combination of Indian problems, the intricacies of the developing Mexican revolutionary process, and a less than clear-cut mandate from Washington, DC, served to bring the colony down.\\" Burnham, together with Holder, made archeological discoveries of what he believed to be remnants of Maya civilization in the region, including the Esperanza Stone. In his book, The Book of the Damned, Charles Fort would use this stone as proof that aliens from outer space had been on Earth. The supernatural nature of this stone would be perpetuated by many other authors in several subsequent books on anomalistics. Ecology The Rio Yaqui was once home to the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and represented one of the northernmost natural locations for the species. Decades of environmental degradation in the region led to the extirpation of the species from the region.http://iucncsg.org/ph1/modules/Publications/newsletter/csgnews221.pdf This was nearly the southern extent for the Mexican grizzly bear.

Story In the future date of 2500, humanity has reached its zenith in space travel and peace. However, after making contact with alien life for the first time, Earth is soon attacked and nearly conquered by a war-driven alien race called the Gurzons. The Earth's Defense Force discover the Gurzon's enemy resides on the distant alien planet Prism, who made contact with Earth as a warning against the oncoming Gurzon invasion. Further investigation leads to the discovery of a computer upgrade system located on Prism called the A/X-101, a weapon program that promises to liberate Earth from the Gurzon's grip. Earth Defense sends four of its best fighter pilots - Bob, Kelly, Chris and their Captain (the player) - to travel to Prism, retrieve the A/X-101 and use it against all of the Gurzon's planetary bases. Gameplay Players assume the role of one of the four deployed EDF Starfighters on their way to planet Prism. The player ship has only two weapons: Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads (smart bombs). While Laser Cannon fire is unlimited, the laser's power weakens with continuous use and must be recharged for full strength blasts. Fusion Warheads will wipe the screen clean of smaller enemies, though will only damage larger/stronger enemies and the ship can only stock five at a time. The player can replenish their bomb stock by way of accumulating higher scores. After the EDF Starfighters download the A/X-101, the ship's shield increases to 120% and their laser fire increases in strength. The ship also has an energy shield which serves as a health bar. Players had no lives and only three continues after their ship is destroyed in combat.

Currently, Gerber is a sub division of Fiskars Brands Inc, owned by the Fiskars company of Finland. Gerber was established in 1939 by Pete Gerber. Gerber was the first production knife company to collaborate with a custom knife maker when it collaborated with David Murphy. History In 1910, the Gerber family started an advertising firm in Portland, Oregon.Williams, Christina Dyrness. \\"Inside Oregon Business: Gerber sharpens edge on growth, marketing\\". The Oregonian, October 9, 2003, Business, p. D1. While working for the family business, Joseph Gerber mailed twenty four sets of kitchen knives to clients during the holidays. These handmade knives were very popular, with then catalog retailer Abercrombie & Fitch requesting more of these knives from Gerber to sell in their catalog in 1939. Gerber started Gerber Legendary Blades that same year. In 1966, the company relocated to new headquarters in Tigard, Oregon. Finnish company Fiskars purchased the private company in 1987. Chad Vincent was hired as chief executive officer in July 2001. By October 2003, the company employed three hundred people, and had revenues near $100 million and was the second leading seller of multitools in the United States, after Leatherman, another company based in the Portland area. On Gerber's website they claim to be the \\"largest supplier of knives and multi-tools to the United States armed forces.\\" Several of their commercially available knives fit this claim, such as the LMF II Infantry, which features a partial tang instead of a full one, ostensibly to avoid electric shocks because the knife was designed to free pilots from downed aircraft. Designs Designers who have since designed knives for Gerber include: Bob Loveless, Paul Poehlmann, Blackie Collins, William Harsey Jr., Fred Carter, Rick Hinderer, Brad Parrish, Ernest Emerson and Matt Larsen. Former Gerber employees who have started their own successful knife companies include Al Mar and Pete Kershaw. Gerber built a line of folding knives based on designs of Rex Applegate.

It is centrally situated on the city‚Äôs most important thoroughfare, Munkegaten. At 140 rooms constituting 4000 m¬≤ (43000 ft¬≤), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and it has been used by royalty and their guests since 1800.Stiftsg√•rden (Kunstindustrimuseum) History It was built 1774-1778 for Cecilie Christine Sch√∏ller (1720-1786), the wealthy widow of Stie T√∏nsberg Sch√∏ller (1700‚Äì1769), chamberlain and merchant in Trondheim. Through her mother she was descended from some of the most prominent noble families in Denmark. From her father, the army Commander in Chief of central Norway, she inherited a large property in the city centre. When she inherited her husband's large fortune, she commenced the construction of the largest private town house in Trondheim. In 1777 she was given the title of privy counselor. She is a representative of the cultural and commercial growth that Trondheim experienced in the late 18th century, and of the city's strong women in that period. She often traveled abroad and seldom used the palace herself before she died in Copenhagen in 1786. The palace was constructed on the grounds of the former residence of her father, General Johan Friderich Fr√∏lich (1681‚Äì1757). During her absence abroad, her son-in-law General Georg Frederik Von Krogh (1732-1818) resided in the building. After her death, it was inherited by his son, Mrs. Sch√∏ller's grandson, and the General remained in residence there until it was sold to the state in 1800 for 10,000 rigsdaler. It was then used by the Governor of the region, as law courts and as a royal residence when the royal family visited Trondheim. The building also had several other functions; it housed the Bank of Norway in the period 1816-1819\\\\. In 1906 the palace became exclusively the royal residence in Trondheim. Prominent guests resided there when in Trondheim. Thus, this location has been the place of residence in Trondheim for the Norwegian Royal Family since 1704. The first royal persons ever to visit the present building were Crown Prince Frederik and Princes Carl and Frederick of Hesse, who were the guests of General von Krogh in 1788.Stiftsg√•rden - the Royal Residence in Trondheim (Trondheim Local Authority) Main front entrance Historic events Stiftsg√•rden has been the setting for the main festivities during the following coronations: *King Carl III Johan, 1818 *King Carl IV and Queen Louise, 1860 *King Oscar II and Queen Sofie, 1873 *King Haakon VII and Queen Maud, 1906 as well as during the following benedictions: *King Olav V, 1958 *King Harald V and Queen Sonja, 1991 Stiftsg√•rden has also been the setting for many other royal visits ‚Äî among others, the visits of the Norwegian regent and first king of independent Norway, Crown Prince Christian Frederik in 1814, King Carl III Johan in 1835, Crown Prince Carl in 1856, and in recent times King Harald V and Queen Sonja's 60th birthdays in 1997 and Princess M√§rtha Louise's wedding in 2002.Stiftsg√•rden - The Royal Residence (Innovation Norway) Building The architect of the building is not identified with certainty, but is assumed to have been Mrs. Sch√∏ller's cousin, Admiral Christian Lerche (1712‚Äì93). Many of the artisans and artists responsible for the interior decorations are also unknown. The palace is built in the Baroque style, but has elements of Rococo and neoclassicism. It has around 140 rooms constituting 4000 m¬≤ (43000 ft¬≤) and is probably the largest wooden palace in Northern Europe. A large part of the garden was separated as a public park in 1906. It was originally laid out in the Baroque style and contained both an orangery and an arbor. The exterior is mostly in its original form. In 1841 some of the dormer windows were removed after a small fire, but those on the garden side are still in place. The orchestra annex by the ballroom was built for the planned coronation of King Oscar I in 1847. The original quarter pane windows were replaced in 1860. However, some of the original windows are still in place in the southern wing on the garden side. Unlike the exterior, the interior has changed significantly. The interior of the side wings has been extensively rearranged, and all the rooms in the building have been renovated several times. However, some original features are still present. The Rococo style stucco work was preserved on some of the ceilings and around the wall niches. The supraportes (panels above the doors) are decorated with painted landscapes. Several of the original wall decorations are preserved, some with Chinoiseries. In the dining room, one can see paintings of cityscapes made after contemporary English copper engravings. The ceiling and the supraportes in the ballroom were painted in 1847, probably using drawings by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer who worked with the interiors at the Royal Palace in Oslo. The painted floors and ceilings in the other rooms are mostly from 1847 as well. The interior of the Queen‚Äôs salon was designed for the coronation in 1906 by architect Ingvald Alstad. Courtyard and back park Furnishings Very few furnishings from the 18th century have been preserved, except two Rococo style stoves from 1768. All the furniture was acquired in the 19th century and later. Most of it was acquired for the planned coronation of King Oscar I and Queen Josephine in the 1840s and the coronation of King Haakon VII and Queen Maud in 1906. The many pieces of Biedermeier furniture were made in Trondheim in the 1840s. The Hepplewhite-style furniture in the Chinese Cabinet was acquired in Paris for the coronation in 1906. The King‚Äôs Study is furnished with a set of Chippendale-style furniture designed by architect Axel Guldahl and crafted by cabinet maker A. Kvenild for the same occasion. The furniture of the Queen‚Äôs salon was created in the style of Louis XVI by Edvard R√∏hmen in Trondheim.

Overview The goal of the camps is to help the guests lose weight, raise their self-confidence and self-image, and teach them healthy life skills and choices. These camps provide weight-loss results of two to five pounds per week on average. However, the more overweight a guest, the more they generally lose on these programs. The effectiveness of these summer camps varies widely and usually depends on the quality of the individual program and biochemistry of the attending campers. Newer programs not only focus on weight loss, but on changing behavior through a combination of training on self-regulatory behaviors and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), as well, to ensure that weight loss persists long after campers return home. Most experts believe these are key elements of an effective program. In addition to weight loss, successful programs can decrease body shape dissatisfaction and increase self-esteem in adolescents. In popular culture Multiple films and television shows have featured programs such as these, including: =Films= * Fat Camp: An MTV Docs Movie Presentation (2006), a documentary television film about five teens at a camp called Camp Pocono Trails (CPT), in the Poconos, Pennsylvania. * Heavyweights (1995), an American comedy film centered around a camp for kids that is taken over by a fitness guru. =Television= * \\"Fat Camp\\" (South Park), season 4, episode 15 of the animated television series South Park, original airdate December 6, 2000: in the episode, Cartman is sent to lose weight at a fat camp where he discovers a different way to earn money. *The Biggest Loser, a reality television format which started with the American TV series The Biggest Loser in 2004, which centers on overweight and obese participants competing against each other to lose the highest percentage of weight (or most weight) to become the \\"biggest loser\\". *Heavy is an American documentary series that aired on A&E.; The series is filmed at the Hilton Head Health Wellness Resort and chronicles the weight loss efforts of people suffering from severe obesity.

Their colonies are polydomous (consist of multiple nests) and polygynous (contain multiple reproducing queens). Like many social insects, T. sessile employs complex foraging strategies, allocates food depending on environmental conditions, and engages in competition with other insects. T. sessile can be found in a huge diversity of habitats, including within houses. They forage mainly for honeydew, which is produced by aphids and scale insects that are guarded and tended by the ants, as well as floral nectar and other sugary foods. They are common household pests and are attracted to sources of water and sweets. As with most other ants, T. sessile is eusocial. This is characterized by reproductive division of labor, cooperative care of the young, and overlapping generations. Etymology The binomial name Tapinoma sessile was assigned by Thomas Say in 1836. Sessile translates to \\"sitting\\" which probably refers to the gaster sitting directly on top of the petiole in the abdomen of the ant species. The common names \\"odorous house ant\\" and \\"coconut ant\\" come from the odor the ants produce when crushed, which is very similar to the pungent odor of a rotting coconut, blue cheese, or turpentine. Description T. sessile is a small ant that ranges in color from brown to black, and varies in length from to inches (1.5‚Äì3.2 mm). When crushed, these ants leave a smell which leads to their nickname \\"stink ant\\". The gaster portion of the abdomen sits directly on top of the petiole in the abdomen of this species, which helps distinguish them from other small, dark, invasive ants. A comparison of the side view of the T. sessile (below) and a diagram of the a typical ant body (below) shows how the T. sessile‚Äôs gaster sits atop its petiole. This leads to a very small petiole and to the gaster being pointed downward. The anal pore then opens ventrally (toward the abdomen) instead of distally. A side view of the body of a T. sessile. It shows that the gaster part of the abdomen is directly above the ant's petiole. A diagram showing the names of the different sections of a typical ant's body. Note that the petiole in this \\"typical ant\\" is in front of the gaster, rather than under it. The antennae of the T. sessile has 12 distinct segments Their antennae have 12 segments. The queens lay the eggs which incubate between 11‚Äì26 days. After hatching, the larval stage lasts between 13‚Äì29 days, and the pre-pupal and pupal stages last between 10‚Äì24 days. Little is known about the lifespan of the ant, though it has been shown that queens live at least 8 months (and probably much longer), workers at least a few months (and show every indication of living as long as queens), while males appear to live only approximately a week. Distribution T. sessile is native to North America and ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, but is less common in the desert southwest. Behavior Colonies vary in size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of individuals. Big colonies usually have multiple queens. The odorous house ant is tough: Injured workers have been observed to continue living and working with little hindrance, some queens with crushed abdomens still lay eggs, and there are documented instances of T. sessile queens surviving without food or water for over two months. They also appear highly tolerant to heat and cold. These ants are difficult to remove from a home after their colony has become well-established. When offered a choice of food sources, the ants preferred sugar and protein over lipids, and this preference persisted in all seasons. When specific sugar sources were studied the ants preferred sucrose over other sugars, such as fructose or glucose. =Food allocation= Foragers collect food that is around the nest area and bring it back to the colony to share with the other ants. T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has multiple nests. Because of this, T. sessile is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce the cost in effort of food transport. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the half-life of the stay at any one nest was about 12.9 days. Buczkowski and Bennett also studied the pattern of food movement within a nest. They labeled sucrose with Immunoglobin G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through trophallaxis (one animal regurgitating food for another). Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the sucrose. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a dominance hierarchy even between queens. They also found that the nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food. It was also found that the rate of trophallactic feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total individuals in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, and the size of the overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased. When searching for food, primary orientation is when ants are exploring a new terrain without the guidance of odor trails. Secondary orientation is when terrain has been explored, and there are pre- existing odor trails which ants use to orient themselves. When T. sessile ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on topography. The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed. They use these types of surfaces to orient along, and lay the first odor trails, which can then be followed in the future, to the food source, by other ants. =Seasonal behaviors= It was also found that this ant species practices seasonal polydomy (having multiple colony sites) to have access to multiple food sources. The colony will overwinter in a single nest, and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple nests. This allows them to better use food sources, that might be spread out. During the winter they will return again to the same nest location. Seasonal polydomy is rather rare, and only found in 10% of all polydomous species. Seasonal polydomy is not found in many ant species, but there are many ant species, including T. sessile, which move within a season: Migration to better forage sites is common. Seasonal activity patterns of the ants were also studied, and corresponding to the seasonal polydomy, it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between March and September and displayed almost no activity from October to December. Daily activity patterns were also studied. In March T. sessile foraged during the day, but in April that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and night. During most of the summer, T. sessile shows low levels of activity throughout the day and night. =Competition with other ants= Competition between species is often classified as exploitation or interference. Exploitation involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other species, while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or aggression. When it comes to these behaviors, a species is considered dominant if it initiates an attack and subordinate if it avoids other species. In comparison with eight other ant species, the T. sessile was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate scale. The ant does not show a large propensity for attack, preferring to use chemical secretions instead of biting. When the T. sessile, a subordinate species, was in the presence of dominant ant species such as C. ferrugineus, P. imparis, Lasius alienus, and F. subsericea, they reduced the amount of time spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as T. sessile, encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the T. sissile forages at the same time as dominant species, but avoids other foraging ants, they must have excellent exploitative abilities to survive. One of the invasive species that T. sessile has had to contend with is the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile. Studies of its interactions with L. humile has helped researchers better understand the aggression of T. sessile. T. sessile ants rarely fight alongside their nest-mates: They only were observed to have fought collectively in six of forty interactions. This often caused T. sessile to lose altercations with other ant species, such as the L. humile, even when more T. sessile individuals were present. Whereas other ant species like L. humile fight together, the T. sessile do not. The T. sessile is however more likely to win in one-on-one interactions because they have effective chemical defenses. =Other habits= This species is a scavenger / predator ant that will eat most household foods, especially those that contain sugar, as well as other insects. Indoors they will colonize near heat sources or in insulation. In hot and dry situations, nests have been found in house plants and even in the lids of toilets. Outdoors they tend to colonize under rocks and exposed soil. They appear, however, to form colonies virtually anywhere, in a variety of conditions. In experiments where T. sessile workers were confined in an area without a queen, egg-laying (by the workers) was observed, though the workers destroyed any prepupa that emerged from the eggs. Odorous house ants have been observed collecting honeydew to feed on from aphids, scale insects, and membracids. They appear to be more likely to invade homes after rain (which washes away the honeydew they collect). Odorous house ants appear to be highly tolerant of other ants, with compound nests consisting of multiple ant species that included T. sessile having been observed. Predators and parasites Some birds and toads will eat odorous house ants on occasion. Wheeler (1916) mentions Bothriomyrmex dimmocki as a possible parasite of odorous house ant colonies, suggesting that B. dimmocki queens invade and replace T. sessile queens. Isobrachium myrmecophilum (a small wasp) appears to parasitize odorous house ants. Pest control T. sessile are not hard to control; they are vulnerable to most ant-killers, which are especially effective when applied as soon as their presence is noticed. If dealt with early, their numbers can be brought under control in just a few days. However, the longer a colony is ignored, the larger the population becomes and the longer it will take to clear the infestation ‚Äì possibly a few weeks. These ants most commonly invade buildings in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), at which times one should be on the lookout for newly-arrived ants foraging indoors. To discourage immigration, standing water should be eliminated in the house, as T. sessile are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed away from buildings, so they do not make convenient routes for above-ground entry. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks, and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it provides sites for nest building near the home, and T. sessile naturally relocate their colonies to be near successful forage sites.

Nocardia is a genus of weakly staining Gram-positive, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. It forms partially acid-fast beaded branching filaments (acting as fungi, but being truly bacteria). It contains a total of 85 species. Some species are nonpathogenic, while others are responsible for nocardiosis. Nocardia species are found worldwide in soil rich in organic matter. In addition, they are oral microflora found in healthy gingiva, as well as periodontal pockets. Most Nocardia infections are acquired by inhalation of the bacteria or through traumatic introduction.  Culture and staining  Nocardia colonies have a variable appearance, but most species appear to have aerial hyphae when viewed with a dissecting microscope, particularly when they have been grown on nutritionally limiting media. Nocardia grow slowly on nonselective culture media, and are strict aerobes with the ability to grow in a wide temperature range. Some species are partially acid-fast (meaning a less concentrated solution of sulfuric or hydrochloric acid should be used during the staining procedure) due to the presence of intermediate-length mycolic acids in their cell wall. Majority of strains possess the cord factor (trehalose 6-6' dimycolate), an important virulence factor. They are catalase positive and can grow easily on the most commonly used media with colonies becoming evident in 3‚Äì5 days. However, prolonged incubation periods (2‚Äì3 weeks) are sometimes needed.  Virulence  The various species of Nocardia are pathogenic bacteria with low virulence; therefore clinically significant disease most frequently occurs as an opportunistic infection in those with a weak immune system, such as small children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised (most typically, HIV). Nocardial virulence factors are the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase (which inactivate reactive oxygen species that would otherwise prove toxic to the bacteria), as well as a \\"cord factor\\" (which interferes with phagocytosis by macrophages by preventing the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome).  Clinical disease and microbiological diagnosis  The most commonly encountered species are Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia farcinica, and Nocardia nova. Nocardia asteroides is most frequently found species causing noncutaneous invasive disease. Most cases occur as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. N. brasiliensis is the most common species causing cutaneous nocardiosis. N. caviae is another species of medical interest. The genus is acid-fast to some degree, it stains only weakly Gram positive. The most common form of human nocardial disease is a slowly progressive pneumonia, the common symptoms of which include cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and fever. It is not uncommon for this infection to spread to the pleura or chest wall. Pre- existing pulmonary disease, especially pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, increases the risk of contracting a Nocardia pneumonia. Every organ can be affected if a systemic spread takes place. Nocardia species are deeply involved in the process of encephalitis as one of its main pathogenic effects. In about 25‚Äì33% of people Nocardia infection takes the form of encephalitis and/or brain abscess formation. Nocardia may also cause a variety of cutaneous infections such as actinomycetoma (especially N. brasiliensis), lymphocutaneous disease, cellulitis, and subcutaneous abscesses. Nocardia isolation from biological specimens can be performed using an agar medium enriched with yeast extract and activated charcoal (BCYE), the same used for Legionella species. Selective media for mycobacteria or fungi can also be inoculated. The most suitable specimens are the sputum, or when clinically necessary, bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy. Further biochemical tests for species identification are not routinely performed. Serological or cutaneous tests are not available.  Treatment  Antibiotic therapy with a sulfonamide, most commonly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is the treatment of choice. Retrieved on January 3, 2009. Freely available with registration. People who take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for other reasons, such as prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, appear to have fewer Nocardia infections, although this protective effect has been considered unreliable, and some studies have disputed it altogether. Minocycline is usually substituted when a sulfa cannot be given; high-dose imipenem and amikacin have also been used in severe or refractory cases. Linezolid appears to be highly effective against Nocardia, but it is very expensive and may cause severe adverse effects. Antibiotic therapy is continued for six months (in immunocompetent people) to a year (in immunosuppression), and may need to be continued indefinitely. Proper wound care is also critical.  Genetics  Although Nocardia has interesting and important features such as production of antibiotics and aromatic compound-degrading or -converting enzymes, the genetic study of this organism has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools. However, practical Nocardia-E. coli shuttle vectors have been developed recently. The genera Nocardia and Rhodococcus have been found to be closely related, supported by two conserved signature indels consisting of a one- amino-acid deletion in the alpha subunit of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and a three-amino-acid insertion in a conserved region of an ATP- binding protein that are specifically shared by species from these two genera. In addition, 14 hypothetical conserved signature proteins have been identified which are unique to the genera Nocardia and Rhodococcus. Name The genus was named for Edmond Nocard, a 19th-century veterinarian and biologist.

His most notable project was the design of the Independence Column in downtown Mexico City. He was the father of Antonieta Rivas Mercado. Rivas Mercado was born in Tepic in the then Territory of Tepic, but his parents decided to send him to study in Europe at the age of 10. Eventually, he studied Fine Arts and Architecture at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France from where he returned to Mexico City in 1879 to practise as an architect and teach at the Schools of Engineering and Architecture (today part of the National Autonomous University of Mexico). Among Rivas Mercado's various projects figure the house that eventually became the Wax Museum of Mexico City (1883); the restoration of haciendas of historical importance such as the Hacienda of Tecajete in the State of Hidalgo (1884), and Chapingo in the State of Mexico (1900); the customs building in Tlatelolco, (1884); the restoration of several government buildings including the facade of the Town Hall in Mexico City (1887); and his own house (1898) in Mexico City, now preserved as a historical building. The Teatro Ju√°rez in Guanajuato, which Rivas Mercado built between 1892 and 1903, is considered to be one of the finest buildings of the period. The neoclassical exterior and neo-moorish interior are a clear reflection of his eclectic architectural style. In 1902 he was commissioned by President Porfirio D√≠az to design and build the Independence Column on occasion of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. The project, which he realised in collaboration with sculptor Enrique Alciati, was finished in 1910, the same year as the anniversary. Rivas Mercado was Director of the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City from 1903 to 1912. He instituted new methods of study and design and is said to have modified the curriculum of the \\"Architecture and Civil Engineering\\" major in order to make two different ones out of it. During his tenure he managed to raise enough money to fund Diego Rivera's scholarship to study painting in Europe. He moved back to Paris shortly after his tenure ended. However, he returned to Mexico in 1926 and died a few months later in Mexico City, aged 74. On 26 February 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Mercado's 166th birthday with a Google doodle.

Precise definitions of this and related terms for types have been established as part of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. In zoology In zoological nomenclature, a syntype is defined as \\"Each specimen of a type series (q.v.) from which neither a holotype nor a lectotype has been designated [Arts. 72.1.2, 73.2, 74]. The syntypes collectively constitute the name-bearing type.\\" (Glossary of the zoological Code ). Historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement (Art. 72.3), but modern attempts to publish species or subspecies descriptions based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types. A lectotype may be designated from among the syntypes, reducing the other specimens to the status of paralectotype. They are no longer name-bearing types, though if the lectotype is lost or destroyed, it is generally preferable to use a paralectotype as a replacement (neotype). Where specimens in a syntype series are found to belong to different taxa, this may cause nomenclatural instability, since the nominal species can be interpreted in different ways. In botany In botanical nomenclature, a syntype can be made in the description of a species or an infraspecific taxon. It is defined as \\"any specimen cited in the protologue when there is no holotype, or any one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as types.\\" (Art. 9.5).

Based on the Messerschmitt Kabinenroller monocoque, which otherwise was a platform for three-wheelers, the Tg500 was a four-wheeled car with a two-stroke straight-two engine. FMR had taken over production of the KR200 from Messerschmitt in 1956. While the KR200 still used the Messerschmitt name and logo, the Tg500 was badged as an FMR.Wagner, p. 169 \\"Tg\\" unofficially stood for Tiger. The \\"Tiger\\" name was claimed in Germany by Krupp, who used it on one of their trucks. There was also a Panhard Dyna Z Tiger at the same time. Features The Tg500 incorporated several features from the Kabinenroller platform on which it was based, including the narrow body with tandem seating, the transparent acrylic bubble canopy, the low stance, and the direct steering. =Tandem seating= Rear view of Tg500s The narrow body, and corresponding low frontal area, was achieved with tandem seating, which also allowed the body to taper like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. The tandem seating also centralized the mass of the car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the Tg500 good handling characteristics. A more minor advantage of tandem seating was that it made a mirrored export version to countries that drive on the left superfluous. The center of gravity of the car was at the rear seat, which meant that the presence or absence of a passenger did not change the handling characteristics of the car. =Bubble canopy= Except for the Sports Roadster model, entry to the Tg500 was through a canopy door hinged on the right side of the vehicle. The door included both the windows (windshield, window frames on all but the Roadster models, folding top on Roadster and Kabrio models, and acrylic bubble on other versions) and the frame in which it was set, extending from the right side of the monocoque tub to the left. On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover. The bubble top on the Tg500 was the same as the one used on the KR200. =Engine and transmission= The Tg500 ran on a air-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine positioned transversely over the rear wheels. The engine, designed by Fichtel & Sachs, was built by FMR. The Dynastart starter/generator unit was belt driven, and had a fan at each end of the unit, one to cool each cylinder of the engine. Unlike the KR175 or the KR200, the Tg500 had a reverse gear in its transmission, which was part of a transaxle unit. =Controls= The controls of the Tg500 were similar to those of the KR200 except for the Tg500's single starting mode for the engine and its H-pattern gearshift with reverse gear and no auxiliary lever. A tachometer was offered as an optional replacement for the clock. =Suspension and brakes= Apart from the use of 4.40 x 10 tires all around and an increase in front track from to , the front suspension and steering were the same as that on the KR200. The rear suspension was fully independent, with universal joints at both ends of each halfshaft, located by lower wishbones and coil springs with concentrically mounted shock absorbers. Unlike the three-wheeled Kabinenrollers, which had cable-operated mechanical brakes, the Tg500 had hydraulic brakes.Canadian Driver - Messerschmitt, 1953-1962 Performance The four-wheeled FMR Tg500 at the N√ºrburgring in 1976 In stock form, the Tg500 accelerated from rest to in 28 secondsMotorbase - Messerschmitt TG500 Tiger and went on to a top speed of .Motorbase - Messerschmitt FMR Tiger 500 Tiger: different site from previous At a similar price, the first series of the Austin-Healey Sprite accelerated from rest to in 21 seconds and went on to a top speed of .Motorbase - Austin-Healey Sprite Mk I Data * Heating/air conditioning: via exhaust heat exchanger / none * Wheel size: * Weight, empty / full load: * Track, front / rear: * Fuel consumption: * Top speed: * Time to : 27.8 seconds * Price: DM 3,650.00 (46% of an Austin-Healey Sprite) References =Citations= =Sources=   * External links * Category:Microcars Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Rear-engined vehicles Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1958 ","title":"FMR Tg500"},{"id":"2357040","text":"Ekwow Spio-Garbrah (born 1953) is a Ghanaian diplomat, banker, entrepreneur and marketing and corporate communications professional . He is a former Ghanaian Minister for Trade and Industry, Former Minister of Communications, Former Minister of Education and a former Acting Minister of Mines & Energy. He also previously served as Ghana's ambassador to the United States and Mexico. He is a former CEO of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) based in London. He is one of Africa's pre-eminent public servants, and an authority on mass communications who has held several high-profile positions. He is a former member of UNESCO‚Äôs Executive Board in Paris and Chairman of the Ghana National Commission on UNESCO. Spio-Garbrah was a member of the board of directors of South Africa Telekom, AngloGold Ashanti and Vodacom SA. He was a member of the International Advisory Board of the African Press Organization (APO). Spio-Garbrah‚Äôs career reflects more than 40 years of top leadership and senior management experience, International Communications and Knowledge Management within the spheres of International Organisations,Government, Banking and Finance, Non-Governmental Organisations, and private business and enterprise with a focus on Africa.  Early life  Born in Kumasi, Ghana to former Ghanaian ambassador Britton Spio-Garbrah and nurse/midwife and poet Elizabeth Spio-Garbrah. Ekwow was a top student at Ghana's premier Achimota School, and received a B.A. in English from the University of Ghana with the top of his class. He completed coursework for a Master's degree in communications from the same university topping his class and obtained a MA in International Affairs from Ohio University in Athens. Subsequently Ekwow received a graduate certificate for International Banking and Finance from New York University in the USA in 1984. In 2001 one of America's leading liberal arts schools of higher learning, Middlebury College honored Ekow with a LLD, honoris causa in Laws for his contributions to International Relations and Africa.  Early career  Ekow Spio-Garbrah's early business experience included working as a mortgage banker in New Jersey, as a sales executive with Southwestern Bell, and as chairman of the Middle East Africa Group within the international public relations firm of Hill and Knowlton in New York. In that capacity, from 1979 to 1985, he provided investment, export and tourism promotion counsel to the governments of Indonesia, Turkey, the Netherlands and Austria; financial relations advice to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Cr√©dit Agricole of France, UBAF-Arab American Bank, and energy sector intelligence to OPEC. From 1988 to 1991, Mr Spio- Garbrah was a Corporate Relations Officer at the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate, in Washington, DC. From 1991 to 1994 he was Head of Communication at the African Development Bank, directing the bank‚Äôs global corporate and marketing communications and acting as institutional spokesman.  Political appointments  = Ambassador to the United States = As Ambassador to the United States from 1994 to 1997, Spio- Garbrah was noted for his success in rebuilding Ghana‚Äôs image across the USA, including organising an unprecedented eight-city investment promotion programme for Ghana‚Äôs then President H.E. Flt Lt. Jerry John Rawlings in the USA. As a result, partly of the successful bilateral programmes he executed, Ghana became the first country to be visited by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his famous five-country Africa visit in 1998 and is now a recipient of the Millennium Challenge Account. President Clinton‚Äôs visit to Ghana was also followed by visits from President George Bush and Barack Obama, making it the only sub-Saharan African country to receive all three Presidents. = Minister of Communication = As a Minister of Communication of Ghana, from 1997 to 1998, Mr Spio-Garbrah initiated, developed and implemented policies and programmes that supported the increasing convergence of telecommunications, broadcasting, the internet, publishing, news media and postal services, all of which were under his supervision. Concurrently, as chairman of the National Communication Authority (NCA), he had responsibility for regulating all aspects of the telecom, Internet and broadcasting sectors. Ekwow Spio-Garbrah was also in charge of the Public Education Committee which successfully re- introduced the VAT to Ghana after a disastrous first attempt in the early 1990s had left several protesters dead. The VAT has since mobilized USD billions for Ghana's socio-economic and infrastructure development in Ghana. = Education minister = While Education minister from 1998 to 2002, Spio- Garbrah was credited with the creation of the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund), which has since mobilized over USD Billions for educational sector infrastructure, transportation, equipment and scholarships. The GETFund law has been widely praised as one of the most transformative pieces of legislation in Africa relating to the education sector. = Minister for Trade and Industry = From 2014 to January 2017 Ekwow Spio-Grabrah served as Minister for Trade and Industry for the Republic of Ghana. In this position, he led in all aspects of national policy making and initiation of legislation for various aspects of domestic and international trade as well as promoting industry and private sector/business dialogue, and collaboration for Ghana‚Äôs competitiveness. He supervised agencies such as the Ghana Free Zones Board, the Ghana Export Promotion Authority, the National Standards Authority, the National Board for Small Scale Industries and the Rural Enterprises Programme.  Other Appointments  = CEO Christian Action Faith Ministries = In 2011, Ekwow Spio-Garbrah was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Christian Action Faith Ministries International. This is a global charismatic movement with millions of members across the world. This appointment made Spio-Garbrah the first person to occupy the position of CEO of a Christian denomination in Ghana. The Church's founder, Nicholas Duncan-Williams is married to the famed US trade expert Rosa Whitaker of the Whitaker Group, once US Under Secretary to Africa. = President Dominion University College = Between 2012-2014, Spio-Garbrah was appointed the President of the Dominion University College, Accra, Ghana which is a private Christian Univeristy founded by Nicholas Duncan-Williams. He was responsible for all aspects of strategic planning for the academic programmes, financial and accounting policies, and human resources and administrative systems for the operations of the private Christian University.

New Providence, N.J.: Marquis Who's Who, 2007. is an organized labor leader in the United States. He was elected president of the AFL-CIO on September 16, 2009, at the federation's convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He served as the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO from 1995 to 2009, and prior to that was President of the United Mine Workers from 1982 to 1995. Trumka was named one of Esquire Magazine's Americans of the Year in 2011. Life and career Trumka was born in Nemacolin, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, to an Italian American mother, Eola Elizabeth (n√©e Bertugli), and a second-generation Polish American father, coal miner Frank Richard Trumka. He is a Roman Catholic. He went to work in the mines in 1968. He received a bachelor of science degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1971 and a J.D. degree from Villanova University School of Law in 1974.Jim McKay, \\"From Mines to Summit of Unionism,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 23, 1995. He married Barbara Vidovich in 1982. They have one son.\\"U.M.W. Chief Married; Threat Upsets Schedule.\\" Associated Press. November 28, 1982. =Early labor career= From 1974 to 1979, Trumka was a staff attorney with the United Mine Workers at their headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was elected to the board of directors of UMWA District 4 in 1981 and became President of the United Mine Workers in 1982. While President of the UMWA, Trumka led a successful nine- month strike against the Pittston Coal Company in 1989, which became a symbol of resistance against employer cutbacks and retrenchment for the entire labor movement.Frank Swoboda, \\"Coal Miner Strike Was Symbol for Labor Movement,\\" Washington Post, January 2, 1990. A major issue in the dispute was Pittston's refusal to pay into the industry-wide health and retirement fund created in 1950. Trumka encouraged nonviolent civil disobedience to confront the company and relied on a comprehensive campaign. The United Mine Workers conducted a nationwide strike against Peabody Coal in 1993. Trumka was asked to respond to the possibility that some coal companies might hire permanent replacement workers. He told the Associated Press in September 1993, \\"I'm saying if you strike a match and you put your finger in it, you're likely to get burned.\\"McClain, John D. \\"Violence Possible, UMW Chief Says.\\" Virginian-Pilot. September 3, 1993. He also said, \\"That doesn't mean I'm threatening to burn you. That just means if you strike the match, and you put your finger in it, common sense will tell you it'll burn your finger. Common sense will tell you that in these strikes, that when you inject scabs, a number of things happen. And a confrontation is one of the potentials that can happen. Do I want it to happen? Absolutely not. Do I think it can happen? Yes, I think it can happen.\\" The Associated Press reported that he was not threatening violence, and noted that UMWA staff had spent \\"thousands of man hours trying to prevent anything from happening [...] to our members or by our members.\\"McClain, John D. \\"Coal Miners' President Says Violence Possible.\\" Eugene Register-Guard. September 3, 1993. Ellipsis in original. Despite claims of non-violence by Trumka during the strike, a union coal miner, Jerry Dale Lowe, was eventually convicted in 1994 of killing Eddie York at a mine owned by the Arch Mineral Corporation. Besides his domestic labor activities, Trumka established an office that raised U.S. mineworker solidarity with the miners in South Africa while they were fighting apartheid.Hill, Sylvia. \\"Presentation: The Free South African Movement.\\" African National Congress. October 10-13, 2004. He further served as the U.S. Shell boycott chairman, which challenged the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell Group for its continued business dealings in South Africa. For these steps, Trumka received the 1990 Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award. =AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer= As Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, Trumka focused on creating investment programs for the pension and benefit funds of the labor movement, capital market strategies,Stephen F. Diamond. \\"Commentary: Trumka may give AFL-CIO the vitality it sorely needs.\\" McClatchy- Tribune News Service. October 2, 2009. and demanding corporate accountability to America's communities. He chaired the AFL-CIO Industrial Union Council, a consortium of manufacturing unions focusing on key issues in trade, health care and labor law reform. He co-chairs the China Currency Coalition, an alliance of industry, agriculture, services, and worker organizations whose stated mission is to support U.S. manufacturing.\\"China Currency Coalition Applauds Senator Obama's Support of S. 796, The Fair Currency Act of 2007.\\" Press release. China Currency Commission. May 2, 2008. Trumka's tenure as Secretary-Treasurer was not without controversy. In 1996, Teamsters president Ron Carey was locked in a tight reelection battle with James P. Hoffa, son of disappeared Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa and a long-time Teamsters union attorney. Hoffa was also out-raising Carey in funds by more than 4-to-1, but the Carey campaign was convinced it could win if the campaign could bypass the local leadership (which supported Hoffa) and get his message directly to Teamsters members. Martin Davis, a Carey campaign consultant who owned The November Group (a direct-marketing company), allegedly contacted Trumka in the summer of 1996 and concocted a scheme whereby the Teamsters would donate $150,000 to the AFL-CIO for spurious get-out-the-vote efforts and the AFL-CIO would pay the same amount to Citizen Action (a liberal grassroots lobbying and organizing group). Citizen Action would then pay $100,000 to The November Group, which would use the cash to finance Carey's direct marketing effort.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"An Overseer Bars Teamster Leader From Re- Election.\\" New York Times. November 18, 1997.Greenhouse, Steven and Van Natta, Don, Jr. \\"Proposed Deal With Democrats Draws Focus of Investigators in Teamsters Election.\\" New York Times. September 18, 1997. The alleged scheme was revealed on August 22, 1997, by a federal government official overseeing the Teamsters' election. The federal government overturned Carey's successful reelection, and ordered a new election. On November 17, 1997, a federal official disqualified Carey from seeking elective office in the union. Carey was indicted on federal perjury charges in January 2001, pleaded not guilty, and was found not guilty on all charges on October 12, 2001. Trumka invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the government's grand jury investigation and a congressional panel, and was never charged with any crimes.Rosenkrantz, Holly. \\"Trumka Has Detractors, Not Opponents, in AFL- CIO Bid.\\" Bloomberg Business News.

May 1, 1998.\\"Teamster Aide's Conviction May Lead to Fraud.\\" Detroit News. November 21, 1999. Although the AFL-CIO had a policy (enacted in the wake of several Teamsters' scandals in the late 1950s) appearing to require anyone who asserted their Fifth Amendment rights to be removed from office, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney wrote in a letter sent to AFL-CIO member unions in November 1997 that the AFL-CIO policy regarding assertion of Fifth Amendment rights had \\"never been applied by the federation\\".Sammon, Bill. \\"House Subcommittee Cancels AFL-CIO Officials' Testimony.\\" Washington Times. April 30, 1998. The letter went on to say that \\"The policy calls for removal only when the union determines that the Fifth Amendment is being invoked to conceal discovery of corruption. The AFL-CIO, as you know, has for some time been conducting its own internal inquiry and has no basis to conclude that there was any unlawful conduct by Secretary- Treasurer Trumka. [...] It is clear that the policy does not apply.\\" During testimony before a congressional subcommittee on April 30, 1998, Sweeney said that a December 1957 resolution adopted by the AFL-CIO amended the policy so that it would not be automatically invoked but rather applied only if the invocation of Fifth Amendment rights were used \\"as a shield to avoid discovery of corruption\\".Sweeney's testimony was paraphrased by the Associated Press to the same effect.

The band formed at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island in 1993. Career Before their major label deal, they had 1 full-length CD Bizarre Gardening Accident and 1 EP The Guinea Pig EP. Angry Salad had an enthusiastic New England following and filled local venues to capacity. They were known for their extensive crowd interaction. In 1998 they secured a deal with Blackbird / Atlantic and re-released Bizarre Gardening Accident as a self-titled album in 1999. The band continued to tour for 2 years in support of the album, and then was in the process of recording demos for their next Atlantic release when AOL and Time Warner merged, and their Blackbird label (along with a number of other affiliate labels) was closed for financial reasons. Angry Salad was left with no label to release their recordings, and in lieu of standard Major Label contracts they lost rights to their name, music, and albums. Some members regrouped as Star64 and released a CD called You May Be Beautiful that contained the songs that Angry Salad had already begun recording. Angry Salad were known in the industry as road warriors, and between the years of 1996-2000, they played an average of over 225 shows per year and spent as many as 300 days on the road each year. In addition to the performing members of the band, the Angry Salad organization included Jim Dand (Tour Manager), Adam Lewis (Manager), and Adam Kamm (Sound Engineer - AKA \\"Mr. Furious\\"). Angry Salad's recording of the Bob Dylan song \\"My Back Pages\\" was used as the theme song for the short-lived WB Network series D.C.

It frequently features shows from London's West End when they tour the UK, as well as regular visits by Welsh National Opera and an annual pantomime.  History  The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham for Oswald Stoll, and opened on 16 December 1912. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. An important feature of the theatre when it opened was a huge water tank at the front of the stage, which could be filled with 100,000 gallons (450,000 litres) of water. Along with the tank was a large protective glass screen which could be raised in order to protect the orchestra and those in the stalls. It also has a dome, which can be opened when necessary; however since air conditioning has been installed it is rarely opened. The theatre survived World War II, but less than three years after it ended, a fire destroyed the stage, though not the auditorium. The theatre reopened about 10 months later. American musician Eddie Cochran played his final show here, in 1960, and was killed in a road accident only hours later, in Chippenham, Wiltshire. The theatre plays host to many top shows, such as Miss Saigon, Cats, Les Mis√©rables, Blood Brothers and Of Mice and Men. This is due to the size of its stage, which is one of the largest outside London. In addition to large musicals it is also a venue for comedians such as Russell Howard, Frankie Boyle, Ricky Tomlinson and Lee Mack, as well as children's shows such as Winnie the Pooh Live. The Bristol Hippodrome has strong links with many shows that frequently appear there, such as the Welsh National Opera. In 2012, the theatre celebrated its centenary with a show called Thanks for the Memories, staged by amateur groups Bristol Light Opera Club and Bristol Musical Youth Productions.  Premieres  The theatre has staged a number of premieres including: * British premiere of Guys and Dolls starring Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide and Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit, reprising their original Broadway performances; the musical opened May 19, 1953 for an eight performance run before opening at the London Coliseum May 28, 1953 and running for 555 performances. * European premiere The Music Man in 1961 * European premiere of Sail Away in 1962 * British premiere of Jeeves in 1975 * World premiere of Windy City in 1982 * World premiere of The Nutcracker by the English National Ballet in 2002 * World premiere of Mary Poppins in 2004 Gallery File:Bristol Hippodrome Auditorium Interior.jpgAuditorium from Upper Circle File:Bristol Hippodrome Auditorium Dome.jpgAuditorium Dome, last opened July 2012 File:Bristol Hippodrome Box Detail.jpgDetail of Auditorium Left Boxes File:Bristol Hippodrome Stage.jpgStage from Auditorium centre File:Bristol Hippodrome Entrance Foyer.jpgEntrance from St Augustine's Parade File:Bristol Hippodrome Auditorium Seating.jpgAuditorium from Upper Circle Box  References   External links  * Theatre site * Bristol theatre archive at the University of Bristol Theatre Collection, University of Bristol * Arthur Lloyd Music Hall and Theatre History Website * Bristol Hippodrome Category:Theatres in Bristol Category:Culture in Bristol Category:Grade II listed buildings in Bristol Category:Theatres completed in 1912 Category:Music venues in Bristol Category:1912 establishments in England ","title":"Bristol Hippodrome"},{"id":"2357082","text":"Dilip Walse-Patil (born 30 October 1956) is an Indian politician, from Ambegaon, Maharashtra, and a six-time Member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.

For example, a political campaign might distribute anonymous flyers attacking the other candidate. It is generally considered unethical in open societies, particularly in matters of public policy. The speed and anonymity of communication made possible by modern technologies like the Internet has increased public awareness of whisper campaigns and their ability to succeed. This phenomenon has also led to the failure of whisper campaigns, as those seeking to prevent them are able to publicize their existence much more readily than in the past. Whisper campaigns are defended in some circles as an efficient mechanism for underdogs who lack other resources to attack the powerful. Marketing Other tactics include \\"buying\\" drinks, or giving away cigarettes to patrons, without making known that the benefactor is a representative of the company. More recently, companies are also paying bloggers to mention products or causes. As a form of astroturfing, companies can hire employees to post comments on blogs, forums, online encyclopedias (e.g. Wikipedia), etc. that steer online conversations in their desired direction. Politics Whisper campaigns in the United States began with the conflict between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as the two were vying for the 1800 presidential election. The Federalists (those on Adams' side) accused Jefferson of having robbed a widow and her children of a trust fund and of having fathered numerous mulatto children by his own slave women. Whisper campaigns are frequently used in electoral politics as a method of shaping the discussion without being seen to do so. U.S. President Grover Cleveland was the target of a whisper campaign in 1884, when Republicans claimed that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was still Governor of New York. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was frequently a topic of whisper campaigns resulting from his support for civil rights and other topics. During the 2000 Republican presidential primary, Senator John McCain‚Äîwhose adopted daughter is a dark-skinned child from Bangladesh‚Äîwas the target of a whisper campaign implying that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock. Voters in South Carolina were reportedly asked in a push poll, \\"Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew that he fathered an illegitimate black child?\\". In addition, on the week of the nomination vote, dozens of radio stations were called on the same day asking talk show hosts what they thought of McCain's fathering of a black child out of wedlock. In 2018, when the question of what the United States should do about the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi was an open question, a whispering campaign was mounted attacking the character of Khashoggi.

Their home pitch is on Randalls Island in Manhattan. The team finished fourth in the 2012 Bingham Cup, an international gay rugby tournament, coming off a 2010 win in Minneapolis. History Gotham Knights RFC is New York's entry to the growing worldwide ranks of multiethnic and non-discriminatory rugby union teams worldwide. Following in the tradition of International Gay Rugby Association and Board teams like Kings Cross Steelers in England in 1995 and the San Francisco Fog RFC and the Washington Renegades in 2000, recent part-time New York City business owner and resident, Mark Bingham, discussed with local rugby player Scott Glaessgen how to form a New York team. Their plans were cut short on September 11, 2001, when Mark was lost in a terrorist attack on United Airlines Flight 93 over rural Pennsylvania. The inspiration of Mark‚Äôs life, work, and dedication to the sport of rugby led Scott and other New York City rugby players to meet in late 2001 to establish Gotham Knights RFC. Practices started in December 2001 and continued in the cold, early months of 2002 under difficult pitch conditions, but within weeks the membership grew exponentially. By late February, the team had elected Toby Butterfield as its first president, a board of directors, incorporated as a New York State not-for-profit corporation, ordered equipment, decided team colors and applied for membership in the Met New York Rugby Union. Warm spring weather in New York City led the team into more intensive practices in March and April under coach Scott Glaessgen. The team added assistant coach Mio Nitta, formerly of Tufts Rugby, as well as a steady influx of new members. Club-wide social events coalesced Gotham into a group off the field. We started intensively recruiting in the metro New York area, searching for a fan base and sponsors to sustain our team. The Knights celebrated their first win over a union opponent in September 2004 over the Suffolk Bull Moose RFC. The club invited Australian Geoff Quinn to be its first head coach for fall 2002. In 2003, Steven Cain became head coach with assistance from Harold Bahr, who took over as head coach from fall 2003 until fall 2006, when players Keiran Lanham and Callum Sigg shared the head coaching responsibility. In 2007, Peter Rizzo became head coach until his departure for Brisbane, Australia in 2008. Spencer Blake stepped into the breach as a player-coach in fall 2008. Jeff Simpson was head coach during a period of team rebuilding in 2009. Philippose Kyriacou became head coach in late 2009. Lenny Pereira became Gotham's head coach for 2011. Gotham's longtime assistant coach Bob Hoban has been with the club since 2002, joined at times by Bob Murphy, Tony Buzzeo, Jeff Simpson, John Dent and others. Currently, Lawrence Blaber, Jr. (\\"Junior\\"), a former New York Rugby Club Assistant Coach, serves as Gotham's head coach. Gotham's first A-side Captain in 2002 was Scott Glaessgen, followed in 2003 by Stace Houk. Luke Martland became captain in Fall 2003, followed for several years by Joe Rice. Keiran Lanham became captain in 2006, followed in 2008 by John Bockwoldt, Eric Di Palma in 2009, Joe Hunt in 2010, and Miguel Hammond in 2011. Joe Hunt now holds the title of Team Captain going into the Spring 2013 Season. Toby Butterfield remained as president until 2004, and went on to join the board of Met New York Rugby, becoming its president in 2008. Gotham's president in 2004 and 2005 was Adam Josephs. Alex Fallis was president in 2006 and 2007. James Bain was president in 2008. John Vernon was president in 2009. Yacov Braunstein became president in January 2010. Longtime player Jon Morgan currently holds the Gotham President position for 2011 and 2012. Every November from 2002 through 2008, the Knights hosted the East Coast Rugby Invitational, at first featuring both traditional and predominantly gay rugby teams from across eastern North America, and later incorporating college teams. The Knights were the host team for the 2006 Bingham Cup held over Memorial Day weekend. 29 teams from 22 clubs in 6 countries participated in various divisions, including the Bingham Cup's first ever Women's division. The Knights advanced to the quarterfinal round of the 2004 Bingham Cup held in London and were runners up for the Bingham Plate that year. In 2006, the Knights advanced to the semifinal round of the Cup division, finishing 4th place in the top division, and the B side placed 4th in the Plate division. In the Fall 2007 Union season, the Knights finished 2nd in the Union‚Äîthe first time a predominantly gay team has reached the championship finals in the MetNY Rugby Union. They competed in the Territorial Playoffs in April, 2008, where there were defeated by the South Buffalo Thugs. In June, 2008, the Knights traveled to Dublin, Ireland to compete in the 2008 Bingham Cup. Gotham competed in the premiere Cup division, emerging as the top US side. In pool play, the Knights easily dispatched the Boston Ironsides (50 ‚Äì 0) and San Francisco Fog‚Äôs B-Side (39 ‚Äì 0), but lost a close match to the Kings Cross Steelers' A-side, which placed second overall (8-16). In the knockout rounds, Gotham defeated perennial rival Washington Renegades (10-0), but lost a hard-fought semifinal match to eventual world champion Sydney Convicts (10-35; notably, the Knights were the only team to score a try against the Convicts in the tournament). In the consolation final, the Knights beat the San Francisco Fog‚Äôs A-side (8-5) in dramatic fashion, with the winning try scored on the last play of the match. The win clinched the Knights third overall in the tournament and earned them bragging rights as the best gay rugby team in North America at that time. Gotham has as an annual fund raiser their Bachelor Auction. In 2009 the Knights issued their first calendar featuring their own players. The pictures were taken by renowned photographer Joe Oppedisano. In 2010 the Gotham Knights A-side won the Bingham Cup in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Gotham B-side placed 2nd in the Crest division winning 4 of their 6 scheduled matches, only losing by 2 points in the final against the Phoenix Storm. At the 2012 Bingham Cup held in Manchester, England, Gotham Knights A-side finished 4th place losing to San Francisco Fog in the semi-final.

After leaving the academic field of psychiatry in the 1940s, he developed some of his own thinking and a larger philosophy. He published Homosexuality: The Psychology of the Creative Process in 1971, and other books about his arguments with psychiatry and psychoanalysis. In the 1940s Rosenfels left Chicago and his family, moving to California. He moved to New York City in 1962, where he established a private practice. He devoted himself to developing the foundations of a \\"science of human nature.\\" In 1973 with Dean Hannotte, he founded the Ninth Street Center in New York City, which provided peer counseling and discussion groups. Early life and education Paul Rosenfels was born in 1909 into a Jewish family in Oak Park, Illinois. He had an older brother Richard, an identical twin brother Walter, and younger sister Edith Nash.Dean Hannotte, \\"A Conversation with Edith Nash\\", Paul Rosenfels Community website Their mother was politically liberal; for years she was on the Abraham Lincoln Center Board on the South Side of Chicago. Their father, a businessman who supported capitalism, died in 1935. In terms of family dynamics, Edith believed she was the favorite of their father; she said he found the boys difficult to deal with, and Richard was preferred by their mother. Richard earned a PhD in botany; Paul became a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, and Walter worked in ad copywriting, where he had more flexibility. As they grew up, the three brothers realized they were homosexual, but never discussed it openly with their parents. Only Paul among the brothers married and had a child. Edith married, became an educator and poet, and had two children. Rosenfels' first passion was history, and in high school he drafted a book on the causes of war. In college he met Harold D. Lasswell, who told him that new insights into the psychology of war and the politicians who cause them would in the future be provided by the new science of psychoanalysis. Convinced that this tool could help him make an important contribution to the welfare of humanity, Rosenfels spent the next decade doing undergraduate work at University of Chicago and earning an M.D. at Rush Medical College; he became board-certified as a psychiatrist. During this period Rosenfels married Joan Maris, a friend of his sister Edith.Edith Nash, \\"Some Reminiscences about Paul\\", Ninth Street Journal, Vol. 7, Winter 1987, accessed 17 March 2014 They had a son Danny together. Professional career Beginning to practice psychiatry, Rosenfels also studied with Franz Alexander, a former student of Sigmund Freud, at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago. He became licensed as a psychoanalyst. He served as a Lt. Colonel in the Medical Corps during World War II. After his return, he taught as an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Chicago, particularly in psychiatry and law. Chief of the Outpatient Clinic, Forest Hospital, Des Plaines, Illinois; Rosenfels rapidly developed a successful private practice and was especially effective in helping women. He lectured at the University of Chicago on psychiatry and the law. After achieving these successes, he became more interested in working to develop larger ideas about human nature, rather than be constrained by details of diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses. =Science of human nature= Rosenfels began to feel that he did not belong in the academic fraternity. He was interested in the larger views of philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and David Hume, who had that the most important task for moral philosophers was the founding of a science of human nature. Rosenfels believed that it was insufficient to focus on the physiology of the nervous system and rejected the idea that concepts such as love and power could not be studied by scientific methods. After serving in the military, Rosenfels accepted a job as Chief Psychiatrist, Reception-Guidance Center of the Department of Corrections, State of California. He had to leave as he did not have a medical license in California. He returned to the Chicago area for a time in his last institutional position, as Chief of the Outpatient Clinic, Forest Hospital, Des Plaines, Illinois. Rosenfels left Illinois, returning to California, where he supported himself for a while as a cook. At the same time, he abandoned his effort to fit into the mainstream by suppressing his homosexuality. He had married and had a family, but was no longer willing to accept psychiatrist' classification of homosexuality as an illness to be controlled and denied. He wanted to accept what he could only call \\"something feminine\\" about himself. He believed at the time that his professional colleagues would never accept him again if he openly espoused these ideas. Rosenfels was rethinking his ideas about human nature. He developed \\"polarity\\" as an organizing principle within and among individuals. In his mature works, he uses his unified and self-consistent vocabulary to explore human nature. In the early 1960s, he lived for a short time with his sister Edith and her family in Washington, DC, when he was in crisis. He had stayed with his brother Walter for a time before that. =The Ninth Street Center= In 1962 Rosenfels moved to New York City, where he established a private practice that attracted numerous gay men. In 1971 he published Homosexuality: The Psychology of the Creative Process, the first book that suggested it was a valid way to live. Gay Magazine described Rosenfels as \\"the Giant of the New Free Gay Culture.\\" Some of his clients in therapy became students of his thinking. In 1973 he, Dean Hannotte, and their students opened The Ninth Street Center on the Lower East Side, an all-volunteer organization devoted to helping unconventional people live creatively in the world. It initially attracted many young gay men. As the Center slowly matured, its members served a growing community of lesbians as well as gay men, and straight people. Their clients included people who believed that human potential, in the words of one of their pamphlets, was \\"too important to leave to professionals.\\" Rosenfels felt the tragic nature of the world. He continued to study people and always said he was \\"only one page ahead of the class.\\" He readily acknowledged the expanse of what we do not know, and said that science can teach us only what we are willing to learn.

It is under Maldives administrative divisions of Gnaviyani Atoll or Nyaviyani Atoll. The inhabitants speak a distinctive form of the Dhivehi language, known as \\"Fuvahmoloke baha\\". Fuvahmulah means \\"Island of the Areca nut palms\\", Fuvah (or \\"Fuva\\") in the local language. Other places in the world like Penang in Malaysia and Guwahati in Assam, India, are also named after this nut. The original name of the island could have been Mulah, but was called Fuvahmulah (the Mulah with the areca nut palms) to distinguish it from Boli Mulah ‚Äì another island in ancient Maldives.Divehiraajjege J≈çgrafƒ´ge Vanavaru. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee. G.S≈çsanƒ´. The admiralty charts and some geographers named the island Fua Mulaku. In old French maps the island appeared under the name Poue Molluque. History A tomb or ziya√¨raiy named Riba, located in a lonely spot on the SW tip of Fua Mulaku Island. The islanders say that it houses the body of a person who had the extreme blessing of finding land and a decent burial even after death. It was destroyed in 2011 Little is known about the history of Fuvahmulah. All that remains are some landmarks of the historical past. These include a much damaged Buddhist stupa known as Fua Mulaku Havitta. Its actual shape has been lost because of the damage done by careless digging to find artifacts or for research purposes. The ruin is about 40 feet in height and it looks like a small hill. A smaller mound, about 15 feet in height, is located near the Havitta. An ancient local poem says: \\"Havitta uhe haudahau, Redin taneke hedi ihau\\".(Thor Heyerdahl visited this island and wrote a book which is named 'Fua Mulaku' in its German edition.) There is also the Vasho-Veyo, an ancient circular bath with stone steps. This stone pool reveals great craftsmanship in the cutting of Porites coral stone (hirigal) by the locals. Among the monuments of the Islamic period, the most important is the Gen Miskit, a neat compound including a coral stone mosque, an ancient graveyard and a well. It is located on the northern end of the island. The Gen Miskit is said to be the oldest mosque in Fuvahmulah. It has been said that the island was depopulated and resettled thrice in the last thousand years owing to lethal epidemics. The last time the survivors of the epidemic went to the neighboring Addu, Huvadhu and Haddhunmathi Atolls and stayed there for a few years. During the secession of the Southern Atolls from the North (1959‚Äì1963), Fuvahmulah was a part of the Suvadive Islands. Nothing eventful happened during those years except that once a boat (Elizabeth Boyer) with soldiers from Mal√© sent by the central government tried to disembark unsuccessfully at Rasgefanno. The island people gathered at the beach and threw stones at the soldiers. The soldiers fired back, and one man of the island was shot in the head and died instantly. Two other islanders who were seriously wounded by gunshots were ferried by d≈çni the same day, to Gan, in Addu Atoll. The British, who were stationed in Gan sent them by air to Ceylon for treatment. =Recent history= On 4 February 2007 a fire burned down the Community Center building. The fire started around 3:00 am local time. The Regional Fire Services, Maldives Police Services, and locals contained the fire, within 2 hours after the fire started. An investigation was carried out by the Police, but a report was not published. Police said the most likely cause of the fire was an electrical short. On 23 February 2007, a fire started at the boat yard near the harbor. The fire completely burnt 6 fiberglass dhows. Four of these dhows were 100 feet and the remaining two were 40 feet long. This fire also started around 3:40 am local time. Fire was first spotted, instantly after the fire started by a local fisherman. The Fire Service was called immediately. But since fiberglass resin is highly flammable, and there was no sprinkler system, the fire spread to the 6 dhows and the fiberglass resin barrels in the yard. It took the fire personnel, Maldives National Defense Force and local 2 hours to contain the fire. A forensics team of the Maldive Police Service did the investigation. All the dhows were insured. In an interview with media, the atoll chief said the loss is estimated to be around MRF 20 Million, although insurance companies never publicly disclosed the figures. This fire is said to be the worst fire in the history of the island. Geography The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. The Fuvahmulah city is about by with a submerged reef (Rashikedefaro) extending for about in a southeasterly direction. The island is the third largest in the Maldives. In the past, Fuvahmulah was a small coral atoll whose southern end was open at a spot called Diyarehifaando and the inside of the island was a saltwater lagoon forming a natural harbor. There is a spot on the southern end known as Kudhuheraival (forest of a small islet), which indicates there was a small separate islet over there in ancient times. The channel connecting the lagoon with the ocean was closed by massive coral boulders in the past. Thus the inside of the island is lower than its edges. In time the inner lagoon lost its saltiness and all that remains today are two small lakes, wetlands and marshy taro fields. In this respect, Fuvahmulah is like the island of Nukutavake in the Central Pacific. The northern lake of the island is known as \\"Dhadimagi Kilhi\\" (lit. \\"Lake of Dhadimagu\\" or \\"Dhadimagu Lake\\" since the lake is located in Dhadimagu ward of the island) and the southern is \\"Bandaara Kilhi\\" (lit. \\"State Lake\\" since the lake has been under state custody throughout history). Lacking a lagoon and being subject to ocean swells, Fuvahmulah was often inaccessible to seafarers in the past. In the early 2000s a harbor was built at the southeast tip of the island, which minimized the problem to a certain extent. The construction of a domestic airport on the island in 2011 has gradually opened the island to the rest of the country. =Environment= Being the nearest atoll to the Equator and the first atoll in the Southern Hemisphere among the atolls of the Maldives, Fuvahmulah has many features which make the island unique. As H.C.P Bell says in his monograph, throughout history Maldivians themselves have fairly judged Fuvahmulah to be the most beautiful island in the Maldives. This judgement remains up to this day within the hearts of many Maldivians who express this both in words and deeds on different occasions ranging from TV and radio programmes to the polls taken by newspapers and websites online. Being a one-island atoll itself and the third largest island in the Maldives (if not for land reclamation), Fuvahmulah includes a diverse range of habitats ranging from tropical woodlands and wetlands to freshwater lakes, well- vegetated marshland areas, white sandy beaches of different variations and pebble texture plus gravel beaches and fertile lands of humus greater in area than any other island in the Maldives. The two freshwater lakes in the island plus the many number of swamps and marshland areas in the island give habitat to different plant and animal species not to be found anywhere else in the Maldives. Among such species, the common moorhen (locally known as Valikukulhu) is a bird natively confined to Fuvahmulah only in the Maldivian archipelago. Also, the dense forest of Syzygium cumini (Jambul), locally known as \\"Dhanvah Baal\\" (literally \\"Jambul grove\\") to the North of Dhadimagi Kilhi is the largest vegetation of Jambul to be found anywhere in the Maldives since this plant variety is nearly extinct elsewhere in the country. Fuvahmulah is also the largest producer of mangoes in the Maldives. Mango trees are found in abundance and every year hundreds of thousands of mangoes are produced from the island. Fuvahmulah also produces pineapples and oranges which cannot be found anywhere else in the country. The common moorhen is a bird natively confined to Fuvahmulah only in the Maldives. The wetland areas of Fuvahmulah are mostly made up of dense vegetation ranging from ferns to reeds to taro fields. There is an abundance of water spinach locally known as Mahilanbo \\"ﬁâﬁ¶ﬁÄﬁ®ﬁçﬁ¶ﬁÇﬁÑﬁÆ and plant varieties such as Syzygium cumini (jambul), pond-apple, mango, pineapple, screwpine, tropical almond, cheese fruit, ambarella, banana and many more. Fuvahmulah is also home to farmland where locals grow crops such as cucumber, tomato, carrot, cabbage, pepper, capsicum, eggplant and ladies' fingers. =Natural phenomena= There is a broad sandy beach at the northernmost point of Fuvahmulah in the district of Dhadimago. It is locally known as \\"Th≈´ndu\\" (In official Dhivehi \\"Thundi\\"). Its sands are formed by white small round pebbles, which are unusually smooth and shiny. This kind of pebbles are found in Fuvahmulah only in the Maldives and visitors to the island usually collect them as a memory of the island. It is common for an annual phenomenon called Bissaaveli to form at the Th≈´ndu. The Bissaaveli forms when part of the sand of the beach moves away from the shore towards the edge of the reef, thus creating a lagoon, enclosed by sand and the shore of the island. This natural event attracts hundreds ‚Äì possibly thousands ‚Äì of locals who love to go to watch it. When it is well-formed, the Bissaaveli is enclosed from all sides, creating a natural shallow swimming pool where locals like to swim. Another natural phenomenon called Kalho-Akiri (meaning \\"Black Pebbles\\") occurs on the south-east shore of the island. This area only has black pebbles, quite unusual to the normal white coral sand beaches of the Maldives. Every year, towards the end of the southwest monsoon season, flying fish (Hulhammaha) come to the northwestern shore of Fuvahmulah. Confused by the number of voracious tuna shoals in the water and by aggressive frigate birds hunting them from the air, the flying fish would end up flying close to the beach. They mostly end up in the area between Thoondu and Dhadimago fanno where this phenomenon is most common. Men, women and children like to go down to the reef to catch the flying fishes by hand in the midst of a joyful atmosphere. Large crowds will gather on the beaches for what the locals called \\"Hulhammaha Hifun\\". Municipal divisions Fuvahmulah was traditionally divided into nine wards. From North to South these wards were: (1) Dhadimagu, (2) Dhiguvaandu (both stretching from East to West shore), (3) Hoadhadu, (5) Dhashukubaa (both segmental) and separated by, (4) Maadhadu, (A diagonal strip of parallel width). The other four divisions, occupying the southern part of the island, consisted of two eastern and western strips, bisected into four wards, (6) Maalegan and (8) Dhoondigan lying to the East, (7) Miskiymagu and (9) Funaadu to the West. In time, some changes were made. In the 1950s, the number of wards were reduced to eight, with the village of Dhashukubaa being merged with Miskiymagu. Since then, no changes were made though the increase in population of some wards has put pressure on the neighboring areas, resulting in the extension of some wards with time, and some claims out of the traditional boundaries. An example of such a case is that of the Hoadhadu ward. The northerly extension of the settlements of Hoadhadu ward by time led to the land from eastern strip of Dhiguvaandu and Dhadimagu wards being claimed by the village. A similar case occurred in the Funaadu-Dhoondigan boundaries to the south of the island. However, no formal changes have been made in any of the cases and area claims of different views exist in modern times. The officially used maps and government sources as well do not portray any significant changes to the traditional boundaries. Taking into consideration the geography of Fuvahmulah along with its size and population, the 8 wards of the island are officially considered to be administrative divisions which act as the replacement for islands in other atolls. In the past, a chief ('Katheeb') was appointed in charge of the day-to-day affairs of each ward of the island as was done for the remote islands of the other atolls. With the introduction of local government policy in the Maldives, the Decentralization Act of 2010 passed by the People's majlis specifically states that in the case of Fuvahmulah an island council has to be elected for each ward of the island. So like the islands of other atolls across the country, the wards of the island act as separate constituencies. From February 2011 onwards the councils have started functioning. Each ward of Fuvahmulah has its own distinctive features. The largest division of the island is Dhadimagu while the most populous ward of the island is Dhoondigan. =Dhadimagu= This is the largest division of the island, located on the north-west of the island. A center of learning as well as an important location for the island's economy. Throughout history, scholars and famous personalities came into being from this district housing many of the historical sites and landmarks of the island. The number of 'Hafiz's from this district outnumber that of any other district in Fuvahmulah. ;Places of interest *Thoondu: A white sandy beach on the north of the island. It is a well-known feature of Dhadimago as well as that of the whole Fuvahmulah. Hundreds of people visit this beach everyday, and this figure is higher on special occasions like Maahifun. *Dhadimagi Kilhi: One among the two freshwater lakes in Fuvahmulah. Found in the center of the district. *Gemmiskiy: The oldest building in Fuvahmulah. In the pre- Islamic period it was a part of the Buddhist monastery and later was the first mosque to be built after the whole island converted to Islam. *The Havitta: An ancient ruin of possibly a Buddhist stupa (burial mound).

The wood is durable in water and resistant to termites. It was used for boat building and for construction purposes in the past. Not only the islanders benefitted from it as it was also exported to the neighbouring atolls. This plant variety is nearly extinct elsewhere in the Maldives. *Dhadimagu Fannu: An iconic feature of Dhadimagu, used for recreational purposes in occasions like Eid (Feast of Breaking the Fast). For Eid celebrations this place stands out in Fuvahmulah history. *Neregando: An anchorage of Fuvahmulah and a traditional harbour. It is a landmark of the boat building industry of the island. =Dhiguvaandu= Located just after Dhadimagu, this is one of the largest districts in Fuvahmulah. Apart from Dhadimagu, the district also share borders with Hoadhadu and Maadhadu. Many residents of Dhiguvaandu rely on white-collar jobs for their income. Retail business is a main source of income as well. The most prominent feature of this district is the \\"Chas bin\\" (an area of wetland) associated with the Dhadimagi-Kilhi.

During the late 20th century, the increase in population of the district led to pressure on land in the neighbouring areas. This led to a northern extension of the village, resulting in land from Dhadimagu and Diguvaandu wards being claimed to the village. Though this has resulted in a change of the believed-to-be areas in a disputed state, no formal changes have been made and area claims of different views exist. Hoadhadu is the first district in Fuvahmulah to have accepted Islam. The smaller size of the village with fewer people during the time of conversion may be the main reason for the village being the first district to be converted. What is clear from historical sources is that smaller districts of Fuvahmulah converted first and the larger districts last. Hoadhadu is a remarkable ward in Fuvahmulah. Historically, many residents of Hoadhadu depended on fishing as the primary source of income, although today retail business along with white collar jobs have diminished the dependency on fishing. One of the traditional harbours of Fuvahmulah, \\"Anbule Athiri\\" is located within Hoadhadu which explains the district's continued dependency on fishing. ;Places of interest *Anbule Athiri: One of the traditional harbours of Fuvahmulah. *Naaibu Aboobakuru School: A defunct primary school in Fuvahmulah.

The most updated population figure for the island is available on the Ministry of Atolls Development website. This gives a sex ratio of 0.88. Services =Communications= Dhiraagu is the only landline telephone communication service provider on the island, as well as in the entire country.

It connects Gaafu Alif Atoll, Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll and Fuvahmulah to the rest of the nation. Apart from Dhiraagu, Focus Infocom Private Limited provides internet services on the island. =Transport= The new harbour Formerly there were many bicycles on Fuvahmulah, an ideal mode of transportation on the flat, large island. Presently there are a large number of motorcycles. The construction of Fuvahmulah Harbour has led to a boost in the number of vehicles ‚Äì notably motor cycles ‚Äì on the island. This has increased road accidents, many of them fatal. The poorly constructed roads have indirectly contributed to road accidents. Finivaa Magu, the main road running from north to south of the island, along with the other roads are not paved. The only partly paved road is the Mohamed Jamaaludeen Naibu Thutthu Magu. This road is still under construction. When completed this road will be the longest road on the island, running from the harbor and connecting all 8 districts. An airstrip is functional on the southeastern side of the island since 11 November 2011. Currently, there two scheduled flights every day to Mal√© from Fuvahmulah and from Mal√© to Fuvahmulah Airport. =Healthcare= The first Health Centre officially started its services on 12 May 1973. Even though the center was fully owned by the government, it did not have its own building, so the center operated in a private house. A separate building for the Health Center was constructed and the services began in the new building on 24 March 1988. As the population of the island increased significantly, and due to the isolation of the island, government upgraded the Health Center to a Hospital on 11 June 2001. =Education= Fuvahmulah is served by 10 schools. Consisting of 6 pre- schools, 3 primary schools and a secondary school. Gn. Atoll Education Centre, the only higher secondary school serving the island, is the largest education center on the island. Inaugurated on 20 April 1982, it currently serves more than 6080 people. students. Fuvahmulaku School (FS) which was owned and operated by the citizens of D≈´ndigan, is one of the three primary schools on the island. Located in D≈´ndigan, it serves the south west part of the island. Government assumed full control over the school on 1 March 1992. Madharusathu- Sheik Mohammed Jamaaluddeen (MJM), opened on 3 November 1992. It serves the north-west part of the island. The school was built by the people of Dhadimago and Dhiguvaado. This is also a primary school. There is another primary school on the island, it is Hafiz Ahmed School (usually referred as HAS) which was opened on 22 April 2004. It currently serves more than 500 students. =Law enforcement and security UN= Historically the island was and still is, considered as a peaceful island with low crime rates. However the crime rate has gone up, especially with regards to drugs. A regional branch of the Maldives Police Service was established on the island on 7 October 1996. Initially, the Police and the Armed Forces of the Maldives were the same, known as the National Security Service. The main objective of the Fuvahmulaku Police Station is to maintain peace and stability across the atoll. They carry out investigations into crimes and public complaints fairly and deliver justice to the locals of the atoll. The station also helps other government authorities in fighting and preventing crime. The station is commanded by a Sub Inspector of the police. The appearance of the NSS (National Security Service) means that the armed forces of the Maldives established themselves on the island. However the police was separated from the armed forces (MNDF) in 2006. MNDF still operates on the island, but separate from the police. They are mostly active in the area of Fire and Rescue, along with military duties. The Defense Institute for Training and Education, a part of MNDF occasionally conducts training programs for new recruits on the island. Notable figures Magieduruge Ibrahim Didi, the most learned man in Fua Mulaku in 1984. Ibrahim Didi stood up to Thor Heyerdahl when the Norwegian explorer visited Fua Mulaku. In front of the translators he demanded to know why such an important visitor from Norway would be more willing to listen to silly things (hus vede) rather than to the sound oral traditions of the island. Then Ibrahim Didi asked some of the old men gathered in the Atoll office verandah for the occasion to stop telling unsound things just to please the foreigner. When the talkative old men fell silent Thor Heyerdahl misinterpreted the situation and humiliated Ibrahim Didi by requesting him to leave. The picture was taken at his home in Fua Mulaku. Picture negative damaged by the high humidity and fungus on the island. Being home to the most number of Hafizs in the Maldives throughout known history, Fuvahmulah has produced many great scholars. Many figures from Fuvahmulah have been leaders in politics, religion and in business since early times. One such figure was the Independence Hero of Maldives, former President Ibrahim Nasir. Nasir was born in Fuvahmulah and the early childhood days of Nasir were spent in Fuvahmulah until his family moved to Mal√©. Another notable figure from Fuvahmulah was the Maldivian cleric and poet Mohammad Jamaaluddeen, known as Naibu-Thutthu. He wrote several raivaru (Maldive couplets) books. These raivarus are taught and examined in schools, as part of Dhivehi language module. Not only was he good at literature, but was also considered to be the most knowledgeable in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) during his time and was appointed as chief justice. The former Vice President of the Maldives, Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmed is from Fuvahmulah and is the first Vice President of the country from outside the capital Male. Former Chief Justice and the current President of the Islamic Fiqh Academy, Ustaz Mohamed Rasheed Ibrahim is also from Fuvahmulah. He also served as the president of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. Dr.Mohamed Zahir Hussain, the current Chancellor of the Maldives National University, founder of the daily newspaper Haveeru and former Minister of Education as well as Minister of Youth and Sports is also a native Fuvahmulah citizen. Among other notables from the island include the current Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Mohamed Maleeh Jamal, former Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmed Jamsheed Mohamed, former Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Ibrahim Rafeeq, former Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority and Chairman of the Board of MMA, Dr. Fazeel Najeeb, former Chairman of the Maldives Civil Service Commission, Mohamed Fahmy Hassan and former Editor in Chief of Haveeru Daily and Haveeru Online, Dr. Ali Rafeeq. Abdul Majeed Mahir, who served key positions in Nasir administration and father of former Minister of Defence, Ameen Faisal and former Maldivian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Dr. Farahanaz Faisal, is also from Fuvahmulah. He was born in Fuvahmulah, to Funaadu Ganduvaru Aisha Didi of Fuvahmulah and Velaanaagey Mohamed Didi (paternal grandfather of President Nasir) of Male, Maldives who was in exile in Fuvahmulah. Moreover, the paternal grandmother of former President Mohamed Nasheed is also from Fuvahmulah. The Isdhoo dynasty which reigned the Maldives from 1692‚Äì1704 also has its roots in Fuvahmulah. The father of Sultan Ali VII, Shah Bandar Kilege, was from Fuvahmulah and he settled in Isdhoo of Haddhunmathi Atoll, thus resulting in the dynasty being named after Isdhoo. Sultan Ibrahim Muzhiruddin of Isdhoo dynasty was deposed and exiled to Fuvahmulah by his cousin Sultan Muhammad Imaduddin II of Dhiyamigili dynasty in 1704. His descendants still live in Fuvahmulah and the neighboring atolls of Addu and Huvadhu. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom is among the descendants of Sultan Muzhiruddin through his son Mulaku Muhammad Manikfan and a lady from Fuvahmulah according to researchers. In 1774, Sultan Muhammed Ghiya'as ud-din of Dhiyamigili Dynasty was deposed while he was on the Hajj pilgrimage and when he returned he was murdered by drowning and his son Abdullah (later Ibrahim Faamuladeyri Kilegefaanu) was banished to Fuvahmulah. Abdullah or his direct descendants never challenged the authority of the Huraagey sultans and continued to live in Fuvahmulah, where their line remains to this day. It is from Fuvahmulah that the branches of Dhiyamigili dynasty in Addu and Huvadhu Atolls too originated. Thus, the many educated figures and intellectuals from this lineage in Addu and Huvadhu Atolls, who later came up to be leaders in politics and different other fields too have their roots in Fuvahmulah. To name some, former Minister of Islamic Affairs Dr. Abdul Majeed Abdul Bari, former Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed, former Attorney General Dr. Mohamed Munavvar, former Minister of Economic Development as well as Minister of Civil Aviation Dr. Mahmood Razi, former Minister of Education Dr. Mustafa Lutfi, former Minister of Transport and Communication Dr. Ahmed Shamheed, former Minister of Justice and Speaker of Parliament Mr. Ahmed Zahir, former Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Dr. Ibrahim Didi, former Attorney General Uz. Husnu Al Suood, Former Minister of Environment as well as Minister of Health and Gender, Dr Mariyam Shakeela; the current Minister of State for Islamic Affairs Sheikh Mohamed Didi, the current MP for Gemanafushi constituency and President of the Football Association of Maldives Ilham Ahmed, current MP for Galolhu-South constituency Ahmed Mahloof and many other, or most of the intellectuals in the country have their roots in Fuvahmulah. Edhuru Hassan Naib Ranahamaadhi Thakurufan, the father of Chief Justice Mohamed Shamsuddin (Bodu Fandiyaaru Thakurufan) is also from Fuvahmulah. Thus, the Bodu Fandiyaaru Thakurufan family, which is considered by many authors to be the most knowledgeable family in the Maldives, along with the eight Qazis (Chief Justice) and the many number of Ministers and intellectuals to have served the country from this family also have their roots in Fuvahmulah. Sultan Mohamed IV (Devvadu Rasgefaanu) is the grandson of Bodu Fandiyaaru Thakurufan and thus he too has his roots in Fuvahmulah.

Its highest peak has never been officially climbed due to the impossibility of gaining a permit from the government of Nepal. Location Machapuchare is at the end of a long spur ridge, coming south out of the main backbone of the Annapurna massif, which forms the eastern boundary of the Annapurna Sanctuary. The peak is about north of the provincial headquarter of Pokhara. The sanctuary is a favorite trekking destination, and the site of the base camps for the South Face of Annapurna and for numerous smaller objectives. The Mardi Himal trek, for instance, climbs towards a minor peak. Notable features Due to its southern position in the range, and the particularly low terrain that lies south of the Annapurna Himalayas, Machapuchare commands tremendous vertical relief in a short horizontal distance. This, combined with its steep, pointed profile, make it a particularly striking peak, despite a lower elevation than some of its neighbors. Its double summit resembles the tail of a fish, hence the name meaning \\"fish's tail\\" in Nepalese. It is also nicknamed the \\"Matterhorn of Nepal\\". Climbing history It is believed that Machapuchare has never been climbed to its summit. The only confirmed attempt was in 1957 by a British team led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Roberts. Climbers Wilfrid Noyce and A. D. M. Cox climbed to within of the summit via the north ridge, to an approximate altitude of . Adhering to the word of honor given to the then King Mahendra, Noyce and his team descended without stepping on to the summit - thus publishing the only climbing record of the mountain a year later. No permits to climb the mountain have been issued ever after. The mountain is said to be \\"sacred\\", but in what form, or to whom, is somewhat unclear. There have been reports of a New Zealand climber, Bill Denz, making a successful yet illegal attempt to the summit in the early 1980s.

He has also played in MLB for the Atlanta Braves and Kansas City Royals. Davies grew up in Stockbridge, Georgia, and graduated from Stockbridge High School and signed right out of high school with the Braves. He made his MLB debut in 2005, and was traded to the Royals in 2007. Injuries prevented him from appearing in MLB after the 2011 season, until he pitched for the Yankees in 2015. Career Davies attended Stockbridge High School in Stockbridge, Georgia. He was highly recruited by many major college programs, most notably Georgia Tech. =Atlanta Braves= The Atlanta Braves selected Davies in the fourth round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, and Davies signed rather than attend college. Davies was a member of the Rome Braves during their inaugural season, when they won the 2003 South Atlantic League championship. He led the team in strikeouts with 148 during that season.http://www.thebaseballcube.com/statistics/2003/10684.shtml Davies was part of the group of rookie players nicknamed the \\"Baby Braves\\" that Atlanta called up from its minor league system during the 2005 season. Davies made his Major League Baseball debut on May 21, 2005, a rainy night at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, and dominated six innings against the Boston Red Sox. Braves pitchers John Thomson and Mike Hampton were both put on the disabled list with injuries, and Davies was called up. Davies immediately made an impact, as he did not allow a run in his first three starts in the Major Leagues. When Thomson and Hampton returned to the pitching rotation in August, Davies was sent back to the minor leagues. Davies began the 2006 season as a starter in Atlanta, after coming to spring training as a probable Class AAA starter. On May 15, 2006, Davies suffered an injury to his right groin while pitching against the Florida Marlins. He was later diagnosed with a torn groin muscle and underwent surgery several days later. As a result of the injury, Davies was put on the disabled list and missed 10 weeks of the season. He ended up making only 14 starts in 2006, with a very poor earned run average (ERA) of 8.38. Out of spring training in 2007, Davies was initially assigned to the Richmond Braves of the Class AAA International League. However, due to the injury of Lance Cormier at the end of spring training, he was promoted at the beginning of the year to fill Cormier's spot. Cormier's inability to return to form after rehabilitating and coming off the DL, coupled with the Braves losing Mike Hampton to season ending surgery, allowed Davies role on the pitching staff to cease being a fill-in role. However, in 17 starts, Davies had a terrible time establishing any pattern of reliability and consistency, posting a record of 4‚Äì8 with a 5.76 ERA. In a start on July 16 versus the Cincinnati Reds, Davies threw just 22 pitches and did not record an out before being taken out of the game. Consequently, Davies was optioned to Richmond on July 19 as rookie Jo-Jo Reyes assumed his spot in the rotation. =Kansas City Royals= On July 31, 2007, Davies was traded to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for pitcher Octavio Dotel. On August 4, Davies made his Royals debut going three innings and giving up five earned runs. He also gave up Alex Rodriguez's 500th homer in the first inning. But on August 9 he was able to bounce back with 6 and 2/3 scoreless innings against the Minnesota Twins, giving up only 3 hits and striking out 4. The Royals won the game by the score of 2‚Äì0. On August 1, 2011, Davies was placed on the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder impingement. He was released on August 10, 2011, and cleared release waivers on August 12. =Toronto Blue Jays= On August 20, Davies signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. =Minnesota Twins= On February 20, 2013, Davies signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. After missing April and half of May due to shoulder problems, Davies was assigned to High-A Fort Myers, where he made his first start on May 15. After one additional start, he missed another month due to injury, making a rehab start with the GCL Twins before returning to Fort Myers, where he made 3 more starts. On July 23, Davies was promoted to Double-A New Britain, where he made 7 starts to finish the season. In 12 starts in 2013, Davies went 4‚Äì3 with a 3.41 ERA and 4 quality starts, striking out 47 in 58 innings. =Cleveland Indians= Davies signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on February 12, 2014. =New York Yankees= Davies signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees on February 10, 2015. He was called up to the major leagues on April 12, 2015, and appeared in a game that night. He was designated for assignment by the Yankees the next day. =Tokyo Yakult Swallows= Davies signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2016 season. =Somerset Patriots= On May 7, 2018, Davies signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the 2018 season. =Lancaster Barnstormers= On March 15, 2019, Davies signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. Personal life During the offseason, Davies works for his father's construction company. He currently resides in McDonough, Georgia. Kyle's younger brother Jake played baseball at Georgia Tech from 2009 to 2012 and signed with the Boston Red Sox organization. He reached the Class‚ÄìA New York‚ÄìPenn League later that year, but was released in 2013. Davies was arrested in St. Petersburg, Florida after a baseball game on August 8, 2011, for disorderly intoxication.

The campus located in Shaker Heights serves junior kindergarten through eighth grade students, while the campus in Hunting Valley serves ninth through twelfth grade students. University School is a founding member of the International Boys' Schools Coalition (IBSC) and a member of the Center for the Study of Boys' and Girls' Lives and Cleveland Council of Independent Schools. History and headmasters In 1890 the founding headmaster of the school, Newton M. Anderson, established University School. The school's first building was erected on at the corner of Hough Avenue and East 71st Street in Cleveland. At the turn of the century, Headmaster George D. Pettee led the entire student body to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, in 1901. A few years later in 1908 Headmaster Harry S. Peters led University School during two World Wars, the Great Depression and, in 1926, to the campus in Shaker Heights. He was the longest- tenured headmaster in University School history; he left the school in 1947. That same year Headmaster Harold L. Cruikshank oversaw the building of the Hanna Wing on the Shaker Campus and guided the school through the end of World War II to the beginning of the 1960s. Under the leadership of Roland P. McKinley, the Upper School moved, in 1970, from Shaker Heights to nearly of meadows and woodland in Hunting Valley. In 1988, Richard A. Hawley, an author and educator, became the sixth headmaster of US. With the support of the US community, Conway Hall on the Shaker Campus and the William S. Kilroy '43 Field House in Hunting Valley were built during Hawley's tenure. Stephen S. Murray became the seventh headmaster for University School in 2005 after Hawley's departure. Murray led the School in the fundraising and construction of a nearly $100 million, 52,000 square-foot academic wing, which features classrooms and interactive technology. Extensive renovation of the original classroom building has allowed for facilities for the visual and performing arts. After it was announced in August 2014 that Headmaster Stephen Murray would leave US to become the 13th headmaster of The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, Benjamin I. Rein of the Collegiate School in Richmond, Virginia, assumed the position of headmaster in mid-2015. Rein left the school in late 2016, with Rick Bryan assuming the duties as the school's first alumnus headmaster.https://www.us.edu/page/news-detail?pk=898887 Headmaster Bryan stepped down in January 2018 due to allegations that he had mishandled a number of sexual misconduct cases at his previous school, the Nichols School.http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/01/university_school_headmaster_richard_bryan_overlooked_red_flags_of_inappropriate_teacher- student_relationships_at_old_school_report.html In the wake of Bryan's departure, dean of faculty and English teacher Patrick Gallagher was named interim headmaster by the school's board of trustees.https://www.us.edu/page/news-detail?pk=988283 On September 22, 2018, the school's board of trustees announced that Patrick Gallagher would officially assume the role of headmaster, following an eight-month search period.https://www.us.edu/page/news-detail?pk=1030172&fromId;=221579 House system University School has a House system, similar to that of British tradition. Every student is assigned to one of ten houses, which integrate students from all grades and provide a structure for the boys to connect between grades with each other for companionship and support.University School: \\"A House is a Home\\" Webpage The ten houses, honoring notable previous headmasters, faculty, or students, are listed below: *Anderson House *Cruikshank House *Goodwillie House *Hawley House (Formerly Brown House) *McCarraher House *McKinley House *Murray House (Formerly Pickands House) *Peters House *Pettee House *Sanders House Publications * The University School Journal is published twice a year for the alumni, parents and friends of the school. * The US News is published monthly by students. Founded in 1898, it is the oldest school newspaper in Ohio. In 2014, The US News became digital. * The Record, released annually, is a compilation of the artistic and literary achievement of University School boys including poetry, short stories, photography, and, more recently, drawing. * The Mabian is the Upper School's yearbook, published every year since 1919.

Athletics The school traditionally has a rivalry with Western Reserve Academy, with the football games being the highlight of each school's season throughout the 20th century, starting with the first meeting in 1895. US fields varsity teams in thirteen sports, five in the winter season and four in the fall and the spring seasons: football, soccer, cross country, and golf in the fall; ice hockey, wrestling, swimming, squash, and basketball in the winter; and lacrosse, tennis, track and field, and baseball in the spring. University School competes in the Premier Athletic Conference (PAC), an eight-team conference. The cross country, wrestling, basketball, track and field and baseball teams began competing in this conference in 2009. Football began its PAC schedule in the fall of 2011. The Kilroy Field House at the Hunting Valley Campus is a multi- purpose indoor practice facility featuring two basketball courts, three squash courts, a 200-meter cantilevered indoor track, and practice areas for track events. The complex also includes a fitness center equipped with the latest in weight training and aerobic equipment. Wrestling rooms, a gymnasium and 25-yard indoor swimming pool with a separate diving well complete the indoor facilities at the Hunting Valley Campus. Outdoors there are a football stadium and a new turf football field, an all-weather track, four soccer and other practice fields, two baseball diamonds, and seven tennis courts. The physical education facilities at the Shaker Campus include a football field; 400-meter track; three baseball fields; two soccer fields; eight tennis courts; double- size gymnasium; wrestling room; four-lane, 25-meter indoor swimming pool; and a rock climbing wall.

Originally formed in Minnesota as a high school band, they were re-formed in Milwaukee at Marquette University by the original bass player, Greg Jeresek. The Messengers had regional hits on USA Records, and mild national success on Motown's Rare Earth label. The Messengers started out in Winona, Minnesota in 1962 as a high school band consisting of: Greg Jeresek (aka Greg Jennings) bass, guitarists Greg Bambenek and Roy Berger, keyboardist Chip Andrews, and drummer Jim Murray. In Milwaukee, 1965, The band consisted of Peter Barnes-lead guitar, Greg Jeresek-bass guitar, Jesse Roe- organ, Jeff Taylor-lead vocals, and Augie Jurishica-drums. This group released a cover of \\"In the Midnight Hour\\", and, shortly after, signed with Motown Records. They then moved to Detroit. They had a few releases with Motown that broke into the 'hot 100' nationally and toured with the Supremes. When The Messengers signed with Motown they could not promote or release a followup to \\"Midnight Hour\\" on the USA label. At this time a Chicago DJ formed the \\"Michael and the Messengers\\" group to cash in on The Messengers' success. This group put out a cover of \\"(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\\", copying the style of The Messengers. They broke up shortly after. In 1968, several of the members of the 'Motown' Messengers left the group and, while still calling themselves \\"The Messengers\\", they became: Michael Morgan, Peter Barnes, Bob (Mother) Cavallo, and John Hoier. Morgan and Barnes would team up again in 1976 along with Ted Medbury to form the short lived pop group The Movies. Discogs https://www.discogs.com/artist/2118062-The-Movies-5.

Early life Montagu was born in the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and baptised there on 25 April 1634. He was the only son of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and his second wife Lady Anne Rich, daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. He had two younger sisters, Lady Frances Montagu (wife of Henry Saunderson) and Lady Anne Montagu ((wife of their cousing, Robert Rich, 5th Earl of Warwick). After his mother's death on 14 February 1641, his father remarried to Essex (n√©e Cheke) Bevill (widow of Sir Robert Bevill and a daughter of Sir Thomas Cheke). From his father's third marriage, he had a younger half-sister, Lady Essex Montagu (wife of Henry Ingram, 1st Viscount of Irvine). After his father's third wife died, he remarried to Eleanor Rich (a widow of Sir Henry Lee, 1st Baronet, Edward Radclyffe, 6th Earl of Sussex, and Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. She was the fourth daughter of Sir Richard Wortley). After her death in January 1666, he married for the fifth, and last, time to Lady Margaret Hay (widow of James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle, the third daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford). His paternal grandparents were Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester and the former Catherine Spencer (a granddaughter of Sir William Spencer of Yarnton). His maternal grandparents were Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick and the former Frances Hatton (daughter and heiress of Sir William Newport, who later took the surname Hatton to inherit the estates of his uncle, Sir Christopher Hatton). Career From 1649 to 1654, he was travelling abroad. He was captain of the militia horse for Huntingdonshire in April 1660. Also in April 1660, Montagu was returned as Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire in the Convention Parliament and in the following month was one of the members who waited on the king at the Hague. He was a J.P. for Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire, from July 1660 to 1681. Also in July, he was commissioner for oyer and terminer for the Midland circuit. From August 1660, he was commissioner for assessment and Deputy Lieutenant for Huntingdonshire until 1671. In 1661, Montagu was again elected MP for Huntingdonshire in the Cavalier Parliament. In 1663, he became commissioner for assessment for Huntingdon and Northamptonshire until 1671, and was sent on a mission to the French king. He was created M.A. by the University of Oxford, on 8 September 1665. In February 1666, he succeeded the Earl of Newport as gentleman of the bedchamber to the king. In 1666 and 1667, Montagu was a captain of the Duke of Monmouth's Horse in the eastern counties while the Dutch were on the coast. Montagu inherited the title of Earl of Manchester on the death of his father in 1671 and took on the posts of Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire and Custos Rotulorum. In 1672 he became master of the swans and also water-bailiff for Whittlesey Mere. He became high steward of Cambridge University in 1677.

Personal life On 27 June 1655, Montagu was married to Anne Yelverton at St. Giles's-in-the- Fields. Anne was the only daughter of Sir Christopher Yelverton, 1st Baronet of Easton Maudit in Northamptonshire and Anne Twisden (youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Twisden, 1st Baronet of Roydon Hall).

It usually occurs on one side of the face, but both sides are sometimes affected. If severe, it may result in difficulties in breathing due to obstruction of the trachea‚Äîsometimes even requiring a tracheotomy. With an incidence in the range of 1:3500 to 1:4500, it is the second most common birth defect of the face, after cleft lip and cleft palate. HFM shares many similarities with Treacher Collins syndrome. Presentation The clinical presentation of HFM is quite variable. The severity may depend on the extent of the area with an insufficient blood supply in utero, and the gestational age of the fetus at which this occurs. In some people, the only physical manifestation may be a small and underdeveloped external ear. In more severe cases, multiple parts of the face may be affected. Some people with HFM may have sensorineural hearing loss and decreased visual acuity or even blindness. It can be thought of as a particularly severe form of HFM, in which extracranial anomalies are present to some extent. Some of the internal organs (especially the heart, kidneys, and lungs) may be underdeveloped, or in some cases even absent altogether. The affected organs are typically on the same side as the affected facial features, but bilateral involvement occurs in approximately 10% of cases. Deformities of the vertebral column such as scoliosis may also be observed. While there is no universally accepted grading scale, the OMENS scale (standing for Orbital, Mandible, Ear, Nerves and Soft tissue) was developed to help describe the heterogeneous phenotype that makes up this sequence or syndrome. Intellectual disability is not typically seen in people with HFM. Hemifacial microsomia sometimes results in TMJ disorders Cause The condition develops in the fetus at approximately 4 weeks gestational age, when some form of vascular problem such as blood clotting leads to insufficient blood supply to the face. This can be caused by physical trauma, though there is some evidence of it being hereditary . This restricts the developmental ability of that area of the face. Currently there are no definitive reasons for the development of the condition. Diagnosis =Classification= Figueroa and Pruzanksky classified HFM patients into three different types: * Type I : Mild hypoplasia of the ramus, and the body of the mandible is slightly affected. * Type II : The condyle and ramus are small, the head of the condyle is flattened, the glenoid fossa is absent, the condyle is hinged on a flat, often convex, infratemporal surface, the coronoid may be absent. * Type III: The ramus is reduced to a thin lamina of bone or is completely absent. There is no evidence of a TMJ. Treatment Depending upon the treatment required, it is sometimes most appropriate to wait until later in life for a surgical remedy - the childhood growth of the face may highlight or increase the symptoms. When surgery is required, particularly when there is a severe disfiguration of the jaw, it is common to use a rib graft to help correct the shape. According to literature, HFM patients can be treated with various treatment options such as functional therapy with an appliance, distraction osteogenesis, or costochondral graft. The treatment is based on the type of severity for these patients. According to Pruzanksky's classification, if the patient has moderate to severe symptoms, then surgery is preferred. If patient has mild symptoms, then a functional appliance is generally used. According to Dr. Harry Pepe, a pediatrician from Hollywood, Fl, the goal of treatment in hemifacial microsomia is to elongate the deficient jaw bone to restore facial symmetry and correct the slanting bite (occlusion). Patients can also benefit from a Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA). Terminology The condition is also known by various other names: *Lateral facial dysplasia *First and second branchial arch syndrome *Oral- mandibular-auricular syndrome *Otomandibular dysostosis *Craniofacial microsomia  See also  * Condylar hypoplasia *Goldenhar syndrome * Parry‚ÄìRomberg syndrome References * \\"Hemifacial Microsomia\\" at the Tennessee Craniofacial Center.

Origin of the term The term \\"alley-oop\\" is derived from the French term allez hop!, the cry of a circus acrobat about to leap.alley-oop, adv., int., adj., and n, Oxford English Dictionary The term Alley Oop was first popularized in the US in 1932 as the name of a syndicated comic strip created by cartoonist V. T. Hamlin. In sports the term \\"alley-oop\\" first appeared in the 1950s by the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL to describe a high arcing pass from quarterback Y. A. Tittle to wide receiver R.C. Owens, who would outleap smaller cornerbacks for touchdown receptions (\\"The Catch\\", the Dwight Clark touchdown reception from Joe Montana by which the 49ers gained entry into their first Super Bowl, was also an \\"alley-oop\\" pass) and later became better known from its use in basketball. History In the 1950s, some players began grabbing balls in mid-air and then dunking. K. C. Jones and Bill Russell teamed up to perform the alley-oop several times while at the University of San Francisco in the mid-1950s. In addition, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain at the University of Kansas and 'Jumping' Johnny Green at Michigan State University would frequently grab errant shots by teammates and dunk them. This resulted in a tightening in the enforcement of offensive goaltending rules in NCAA and NBA basketball in the late 1950s. The Phillips 66ers of the National Industrial Basketball League had an alley-oop play in its playbook where Charlie Bowerman would pass the ball to Don Kojis. Kojis played two seasons for the 66ers between 1961 and 1963 making that the time period when the play was executed. Al Tucker and his brother Gerald at Oklahoma Baptist University are sometimes mistakenly credited with being the first to use the alley-oop in the mid-60s. In Bill Walton's record-setting 44-point, 21-for-22 shooting performance for UCLA in the 1973 NCAA championship game against Memphis State, six of his baskets came on alley-oop plays. Some others credit David Thompson as the first player to execute the classic alley-oop play while at North Carolina State University, with his teammates Monte Towe and Tim Stoddard performing the necessary lob passes. NCSU's Thompson popularized the play during the early 1970s, exploiting his 44-inch vertical leap to make the above-the-rim play a recurring staple in the Wolfpack's offensive attack. Because dunking was illegal in college basketball at that time, upon catching the pass, Thompson would simply drop the ball through the hoop ‚Äì never dunking one until the final play of the final home game of his career. After a decade of dunking prohibition ended in the NCAA in 1976, the alley-oop became associated in the late 1970s with Michigan State's Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and Greg Kelser. The duo connected for many highlight alley-oops and would showcase the play in their 1979 national championship run, including the most watched game in the history of the sport, the famed Magic vs. Bird championship game. Three years later, unheralded Idaho made the alley-oop an integral part of their undersized offense in 1982, ended the regular season eighth in both major polls and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. The following year, North Carolina State also won the national championship on what could be considered the most famous alley-oop of all time against heavily-favored Houston in the 1983 championship game at The Pit in Albuquerque, New Mexico. With time running out and the score tied, guard Dereck Whittenburg shot short of the rim, which effectively functioned as a pass to Lorenzo Charles, who caught the ball and stuffed it through the net to win the title in a During the 1990s, NBA stars turned the alley-oop into the game's ultimate quick-strike weapon. In recent years. teams have often run the alley-oop as a planned play. The 2008 National Champions Kansas Jayhawks had several designs for alley-oops, including some thrown from inbound sets, and could execute them interchangeably with almost all of the players being able to both lob and finish the play. Popular culture In the 2008 film Semi-Pro, protagonist Jackie Moon, played by Will Ferrell, invents the alley-oop after being knocked unconscious and speaking with his deceased mother in a depiction of Heaven. The crowd and announcers are left nearly speechless, unable to comprehend what happened. The referee is dumbfounded and feels the play should be a foul, and maybe even two fouls. Monix, played by Woody Harrelson, breaks down the mechanics of the play and convinces the referee that it's worth two points. This play allowed the fictional Flint Tropics to rally back and eventually defeat the San Antonio Spurs.

Spam musubi is a popular snack and lunch food composed of a slice of grilled Spam sandwiched either in between or on top of a block of rice, wrapped together with nori in the tradition of Japanese omusubi. Inexpensive and portable, Spam musubi are commonly found near cash registers in convenience stores or mom-and-pop shops all over Hawaii. Musubi can be easily made with the right materials, and typically only uses spam, rice, some salt, nori and shoyu(soy sauce). In Hawaii, musubi made from homemade spam is served on catering trays at formal events by celebrity chefs such as Alan Wong at his exclusive restaurants. History Spam became a popular food in Hawaii after World War II. Spam was a main course for the troops during the war, and the large military presence in Hawaii led to Spam's widespread local adoption. Spam musubi was actually created in the Japanese internment camps on the mainland of the United States during the war although it is often credited to Hawaii because of its prevalence. Preparation Typical preparation begins with grilling slices of Spam, sometimes with a light teriyaki flavor. It uses a sauce in which soy sauce and granulated sugar are typically the basic ingredients. Using a mold the same size as a slice of Spam, a layer of cooked rice is pressed down over a strip of nori, with a slice of Spam on top of that, and then, optionally, another layer of rice. The mold is removed and the nori is wrapped over the top and around the musubi. It is served sometimes with soy sauce or Japanese mayonnaise. Variants Spam musubi with egg. Similar to the Japanese onigiri, variations on the traditional Spam musubi exist. The following are just a few examples of the limitless variations: *Furikake mixed into the rice *Scrambled egg added between the Spam and rice *Takuan added between the Spam and rice *Teriyaki sauce can be added to the spam The spam may also be replaced with hot dog, fried shrimp, chicken teriyaki, chicken katsu, pork cutlet, Portuguese sausage (lingui√ßa), char siu (roast pork), or other proteins instead of Spam.

It won the Philip K. Dick Award in 2002, and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2003. The author was inspired to write The Mount after she took a class in the psychology of prey animals. After the class, Emshwiller wondered what it would be like if a smart prey animal rode a predator. The idea fascinated her enough to write a short story which became The Mount.Robert Freeman Wexler interviews Carol Emshwiller, \\"Emshwiller Interview\\" Laconic Writer, posted: Jan 19th 2010, accessed: Jun 6th, 2010  Plot summary  The first-person narrator, Charley, is a young man who, like all humans, is used as a riding mount (e.g. horses) for an alien race known as Hoots. Humans in Charley's world, a pastoral Earth, have existed in a master- slave relationship with the Hoots for centuries. The Hoots, who have no way to return to their home planet, maintain the natural systems that keep the world running. Escaped mounts like Charley's father, formerly the Guards' Mount known as Heron, lead assaults on the stables where humans are kept and seek to unify their own people against the Hoots. When Charley (mount name Smiley) meets his father for the first time (Heron and Merry Mary were mated and separated by the Hoots soon after Charley was born), he resists betraying either his Master, the Hoot heir apparent, or anything that might help the resisting humans because his life as a mount (breed Seattle) is the only one he's ever known. The Hoots The Hoots are a race that have evolved from prey. They are herbivores who have developed a set of very keen senses which allowed them to tame and use predators as mounts. The need for mounts is due to the fact that Hoots have very weak leg muscles, which prevents them from moving about efficiently. Most Hoots have never developed their leg muscles and use either mounts or small bicycle devices to move about. Hoots have very large and strong hands which were evolved for strangling predators. They also have large eyes and very large ears. The ears are used as a way of expressing emotions. For example, when a Hoot laughs, their ears flap up and down.  Reception  Peter Cannon praised the novel in his review for the magazine Publishers Weekly, saying that it was \\"Brilliantly conceived and painfully acute in its delineation of the complex relationships between masters and slaves, pets and owners, the served and the serving, this poetic, funny and above all humane novel deserves to be read and cherished as a fundamental fable for our material-minded times.\\" Kirkus Reviews said that \\"with patience and enormous affection for her four-legged characters, Emshwiller has fashioned an affecting, plausible story that manages to sidestep a heavy- handed symbolism. A deceptively simple, clear-eyed story that should find its sympathetic Gullivers.\\" Michael Hemmingson reviewing for Review of Contemporary Fiction said \\"it took me about thirty pages to figure out who was narrating the narrative--my one complaint--but the title should have given it away sooner. While a quirky novel, it is very easy to fall into the rhythm of Emshwiller's poetic and smooth sentences and run with the flow.\\"  Notes  Category:2002 American novels Category:American science fiction novels ","title":"The Mount (novel)"},{"id":"2357282","text":"The Holland Sentinel is a newspaper published seven days a week in Holland, Michigan, United States, founded in 1896.

It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Makeup for a Series. In this episode, Angel is captured and enslaved in a fighting club, and must fight his way to freedom, or rely on Cordelia Chase and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce to save him. Plot As Cordelia and Wesley bicker while using a new demon database, Darin MacNamara stumbles into the Angel Investigations office, saying his brother Jack was kidnapped the previous night by a group that was not \\"exactly people\\". Darin tells Angel he and his brother were not close, since Jack wasn't as successful as Darin. Jack had a gambling problem and, though Darin had paid off bookies for him in the past, had recently refused to help him again. He felt guilty afterwards and went to Jack's place in time to see the non-people taking him away. Angel goes to find Ernie, the bookie Darin wouldn't pay off, and interrupts his poker game to try to get information. He promises that Darin will pay off Jack's debts, but Ernie says it's no longer about money, but about making an example out of Jack. Angel offers him some money and learns that Jack may be somewhere under Beechwood Canyon. Cordelia and Wesley search the demon database with the information Darin gave them about the demon who took Jack. Wesley argues that by the time Cordelia finds the demon on the computer he could find it in his book, but Cordelia proves him wrong, producing a Howler demon. Angel heads into a sewer under Beechwood Canyon and is attacked by Howler demons. He asks one of them where Jack is and is told that he was sold.

In another room, two demons are fighting each other in a pit. One of the demons is knocked down and the crowd chants, ‚ÄúKilling blow!‚Äù A man nearby tosses a knife to the other demon, who slits the other's throat. The crowd cheers and the demon, Tom Cribb, is pronounced the winner. The next demon up, Val Trepkos, is announced as Angel spots Jack being led through the crowd. He follows them down a corridor, where they meet up with Darin. Darin warns Jack to be wary of Angel, since he managed to defeat the Howler demons. Angel realizes that he was set up and tries to fight off the guys, who are attempting to check him over, until cattle prods render him unconscious. Jack announces that Angel will be ‚Äúa crowd-pleaser.‚Äù Angel awakens later to find himself with his jacket and shirt off, in a cage, surrounded by other demons in cages. He has a silver bracelet on his wrist that reads ‚ÄúXXI‚Äù, which he learns keeps him imprisoned. He tries to converse with his fellow captives but they don't appear to speak English. Jack tells the ‚Äúslaves‚Äù that the only rule is that they stay inside the red area marked off around the cages. They can only get out of the red area when their bracelets are removed, and that only happens after their 21st kill. Angel refuses to kill anyone and Jack replies that in that case, he'll be the one killed. The next day, Wesley calls Kate and is disappointed to learn that she doesn't know where Angel is. Cordelia is also worried that they can't reach Darin. Angel's fellow slaves are served food as they all engage in a little macho prison-guy talk. One of the demons, Mellish, warns Angel not to disturb things or he'll get himself killed. One of the demons tries to escape, but when he crosses the red line, he disintegrates, leaving only his bracelet behind. Angel is chosen as his replacement for a fight. Wesley interrupts Ernie while he's beating someone up, but Ernie won't give him any information without being paid. Ernie draws a gun but Wesley shoots the gun out of his hand with a crossbow bolt, intimidating Ernie's goons into dropping their own guns and allowing Wesley to ask Ernie where Angel is. While the fights are starting up that night, the woman whose ticket Angel looked at the night before talks to Darin about Angel. She mentions that he has a soul and wonders if this will give him an advantage in the ring. One of the demons tries to give Angel pointers for his fight, but Angel says that he's not going to kill him. The other demon tells him that he doesn't have a choice. Angel and his opponent enter the ring, and Cribb, the demon who fought the previous night, notes that Angel isn't even fighting. Cordelia and Wesley arrive at the arena, dressed up in fancy clothes. They realize too late that they've forgotten their fake police badge, but Cordelia approaches a couple anyway, introducing herself as Detective Andrews and Wesley as Detective Yelsew (Wesley backwards). Wesley flashes his wallet instead of a badge and Cordelia tells him to take down the couple's license plate number. She checks the couple's tickets and tells them that they're for an unlicensed event. Wesley warns that a raid is going to happen there tonight, so the couple decides to leave, leaving Cordelia and Wesley their tickets. Inside, Baker beats on Angel, who still won't fight back. Cordelia and Wesley enter, spotting Darin, who's holding a bracelet. Wesley notes that these demon matches have been revived from the Roman Empire and that the bracelets kill people if they're wearing them when they cross the red line. Darin puts the bracelet down and gestures for a guard to drop a knife into the pit. Baker picks the knife up, cutting Angel's arm with it. Angel morphs into vamp face and the crowd chants, ‚ÄúKilling blow!‚Äù Angel defends himself from a few more hits, then stabs Baker in the chest with the knife. Once Baker is dead, the announcer says that Angel has made his first career kill. Angel heads back to join the other demons as Jack announces that it's time for a match between Trepkos and (expected loser) Mellish. Angel tells Trepkos that if he and Mellish don't fight, neither of them will die. Cribb tells Angel that he's not an expert just because he's made one kill; Angel replies that that wasn't his first kill. Angel tells Trepkos that they can fight their captors if they stop killing each other. Trepkos instead says that he'll kill Mellish quickly, a decision which pleases Jack. Once they're in the ring, Trepkos fulfills his promise. Outside the building, Cordelia tells Wesley that they need to call the police, but he thinks that Darin will destroy the evidence before anything can happen. Cordelia realizes that he would kill the demons and says that they need to get Angel out, which entails getting his bracelet off. Wesley thinks that, if he can get a bracelet, he'll be able to figure out how to forge a magical key to release other bracelets. Cordelia reveals that she swiped a bracelet when he wasn't looking. When Jack congratulates Angel on his victory, calling him \\"a demon like the others\\", Angel grabs Jack and pulls him close to the red line. He asks Jack how to remove the bracelet and asks the demons to check Jack's pockets for a key; they won't help him. Darin enters with his guards and Angel agrees to let Jack go when he and the other demons are released. Darin pulls out a gun and calmly shoots Jack, and the guards again knock out Angel with cattle prods. He wakes up in the office of Lilah Morgan, the woman he and Darin both talked to earlier. She introduces herself as a lawyer working for Wolfram & Hart, and explains that she persuaded Darin to sell his contract to ‚Äúthe partners‚Äù. She tells him that he's free to go, provided he pretend the fighting never happened; after all, Lilah points out, there are a lot of people for him to help in L.A. Angel refuses to compromise, and willingly returns to the arena, where the other demons call him crazy for returning. Darin snaps Angel's bracelet back on and tells him that he's fighting Trepkos next; if Trepkos wins, Angel will be his 21st kill. Wesley messes around with the bracelet, trying to find something that will conduct electricity. Cordelia provides Wesley with a horsehair bracelet (‚Äúfrom Keanu, my palomino, before the IRS took him away‚Äù) which does exactly what he needs it to do to the silver bracelet. Back at the arena, Lilah places a $10,000 bet on Trepkos. Angel and Trepkos enter the ring, where Angel tells Trepkos that even if he kills 21 demons, he will always be a slave. Trepkos says that he'll kill him quickly and Angel replies that he won't let him. The fight begins and, again, Angel defends himself. Cordelia distracts a guard so that Wesley can get to the slaves‚Äô quarters. He asks Cribb where Angel is and is told that he'll be dead soon. Wesley announces that he has a key to open all of the demon's bracelets and Cribb grabs it from him. A guard drops wooden staffs into the pit and Trepkos charges Angel with one of them. Wesley returns to Cordelia and tells her that someone took his key. The fighting continues and Angel gets part of Trepkos‚Äô staff, holding it to his throat. Cribb unlocks his bracelet, watching as Angel starts to walk away from the fight, then get overtaken by Trepkos. The crowd encourages Trepkos to kill Angel, but Trepkos decides not to. Darin sends guards after both of them, but Wesley pulls out a gun and tells Darin to stop the guards. Cribb and the other demons storm the arena and Wesley and Darin start fighting over the gun. The demons and guards face off and Cribb unlocks Angel's bracelet, calling him a loser. The spectators all leave the arena. Darin is about to shoot Wesley when Cordelia pushes him into the pit. Darin points the gun at Trepkos and blasts him for not killing Angel when it would have set him free. Cribb puts a bracelet on Darin's wrist. Darin is thrown out of the red circle and disintegrates. Cribb unlocks Trepkos‚Äô bracelet and Angel and Trepkos congratulate each other on a good fight. ‚ÄúI could have taken you,‚Äù Angel claims. Cordelia and Wesley help Angel out of the building and he thanks them for finding him before it was too late. Cordelia says that Wesley was the one who figured out how to make the key, and Wesley says that she was the one who figured out that horsehair would work. Angel says that they did good work, even though, as Cordelia points out, they released a bunch of demons. Production This episode marks the first appearance of Lilah Morgan, who is a recurring character for the next three seasons. Producer Tim Minear comments on the contradiction exhibited by Wolfram & Hart in this episode: they offer to free Angel provided he forget what he knows, yet later hire an assassin to kill him in \\"Five by Five\\". \\"At the point Faith was involved, they wanted him dead, but not now,\\" he says. \\"I think if you have a little patience, it will all make sense.\\" =Continuity= * When Cordelia is browsing the demon database, Wesley asks her if they have \\"the Vagaries of Oden Tal.\\" This is a reference to the main antagonists of the episode \\"She\\".

He served as the 27th Governor of Michigan from 1911 to 1913. The governor spent time at Possum Poke in Georgia, using it as a retreat and a place to write. He would later die there on April 11, 1949, aged 89. Early life in Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin Osborn was born in a log house in Huntington County, Indiana to George A. Osborn and Margaret (Fannon) Osborn, who named him Chase Salmon after abolitionist Salmon Chase, who would become the next U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Abraham Lincoln, and later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He was educated at Purdue University, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, yet left before graduating. From there he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and briefly worked for the Chicago Tribune. On May 7, 1881, while a reporter for the Evening Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he married Lillian G. Jones. They moved north, near the Michigan border, to Florence, Wisconsin, where he ran a local newspaper and prospected for iron. Life and politics in Michigan Osborn later moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan where he ran another newspaper, The Sault News, and also began his involvement in politics. In 1889, he was appointed Postmaster of Sault Ste. Marie and, in 1895, state Fish and Game Warden. In 1898, Governor Hazen S. Pingree appointed Osborn Commissioner of Railroads, a position in which he served from 1899 to 1903. After selling out his newspaper, he and Walter J. Hunsaker bought The Saginaw Courier Herald. In 1900, he was unsuccessful to win the Republican nomination for Governor of Michigan, losing to Aaron T. Bliss, who won the general election. In 1908, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Michigan to nominate William Howard Taft for U.S. President. That same year he became a member of the University of Michigan Board of Regents and served from 1908 to 1911. In 1910, Osborn was elected the 27th Governor of Michigan and served from 1911 to 1913. His tenure as governor was focused on reforms as the state deficit was eliminated; a workmen's compensation bill was sanctioned; and a presidential primary law was authorized. In 1912, Osborn campaigned for Theodore Roosevelt for president to unseat the current President Taft. After Roosevelt lost the Republican nomination and bolted from the party to start the Progressive Party, Osborn still campaigned for him in Illinois, Missouri, and Oklahoma, yet not in Michigan. Osborn did not run for a second term and is to date the only governor of Michigan from the Upper Peninsula. Governor Osborn at his desk in his office. After his term as governor, Osborn traveled the world and came back for another attempt to become governor again and unseat his successor, Democrat Woodbridge Nathan Ferris, but was unsuccessful. In 1918 he was a candidate in the primary for United States Senator from Michigan, being defeated by fellow Republican Truman H. Newberry. He supported Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations, and urged participation in world affairs during the 1920s and 1930s despite the consensus of isolationism during those years. Osborn met Stellanova Brunt in 1924, and she took a job as his researcher and secretary. In 1928, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Vice President, yet was defeated by Charles Curtis, who would win with Herbert Hoover as president. In 1930, he was again a candidate in the primary for the U.S. Senate, being defeated by fellow Republican James Couzens. In 1931, Chase and Lillian Osborn legally adopted 37-year-old Stellanova, and she changed her last name to Osborn. In 1934, he was elected chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. In 1936, he was a candidate for Presidential Elector to elect Alfred Landon, who would lose to Franklin Roosevelt. In 1939, he met with Roosevelt to lobby for construction of the Mackinac Bridge, a project that would be completed in 1957 after the deaths of both Osborn and Roosevelt. Retirement, death, and legacy After politics, Osborn returned to the newspaper business and became active in the pursuit of iron ore prospecting. He was a member of the Audubon Society, National Rifle Association, Sons of the American Revolution, Freemasons, Elks, Kiwanis, Knights of Pythias, Lions Club, Odd Fellows, Sigma Chi, and Sigma Delta Chi. He was also the author of several books. Osborn used a wheelchair, and Stellanova became his full-time nurse. After his wife Lillian died, Stellanova's adoption was annulled. On April 9, 1949, at Osborn's Georgia residence, he at 89 and Stellanova at 54 were married. He died two days later at Possum Poke, his residence in Poulan, Georgia. He is interred at Duck Island, his Michigan residence on Sugar Island, near Sault Ste. Marie in the St. Marys River. Osborn's book The Iron Hunter (1919; republished 2002) is autobiographical. The title refers to work he did prospecting for iron ore in Wisconsin and the Michigan Upper Peninsula and reflects his love of the outdoors. He wrote several other books and co- wrote some with his adopted daughter, Stellanova, who also wrote several books herself. There is an undated oil painting on canvas of Governor Osborn on display at the Bay Mills Community College Library and Heritage Center in Brimley, MI. The riverfront walk in downtown Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan features a historical monument and bust of Osborn. The Student Union at the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan also holds a bust of Osborn on the first floor. The female freshman dormitory at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie is named in honor of him.  See also * Possum Poke *Honoring Governor Osborn / Preserve *Governor Chase S.

History The 1st World Scout Jamboree was held in 1920, and was hosted by the United Kingdom. Since then, there have been twenty-three other World Scout Jamborees, hosted in various countries, generally every four years. The 25th World Jamboree is to be held in Korea in 2023. There are also national and continental jamborees held around the world with varying frequency. Many of these events will invite and attract Scouts from overseas. Other gatherings With the birth of the Jamboree concept, other large gatherings are also organized by national Scout organizations, geared towards a particular group of Scouts. Examples of these large gatherings include: *Moot - a camp or a gathering of Rovers *Venture - a gathering of young people in the Venture (Senior Scout) section *Indaba - a camp or a gathering of Adult Scout leaders *Agoonoree - a camp of Scouts with special needs *COMDECA - acronym for Community Development Camp, a large gathering of young people, implementing community development projects Etymology The origin of the word jamboree is not well understood. It is popularly believed within the Scout Movement that the word was coined by Baden-Powell, but there is no written documentation by either Powell or Scouting publications. =Dictionary etymologies= This is reflected in many dictionary entries. For example, according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, the etymology is \\"19th century, origin unknown\\". The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) identifies it as coming from American slang, identifying a use in the New York Herald in 1868 and in Irish writing later in the 19th century. =Use prior to Scouting= Baden-Powell was once asked why he chose \\"jamboree\\". He replied, \\"What else would you call it?\\" Other than a light-hearted retort, one way his response could have made sense is if the word had already had a specific meaning. However, within a half century its use outside the Scouting program was lost. Other writers used \\"jamboree\\" in the early 20th century, prior to its use in Scouting, to refer to \\"a lavish or boisterous celebration or party\\". Poet Robert W. Service used the term in a poem published in 1912. Lucy Maud Montgomery used the term three times in 1915 in Anne of the Island, a book set in the 1880s. For example: > There was quite a bewildering succession of drives, dances, picnics and > boating parties, all expressively lumped together by Phil under the head of > ‚Äújamborees‚Äù. Robert Graves suggested in 1954 that Baden-Powell might have known the word through his regiment's Irish links, rather than from U.S. slang. =Current best guess= The word \\"jamboree\\" today has several claimed possible origins, ranging from Hindi to Swahili to Native American languages, which further confuses the meaning used by Baden-Powell. A guess is that the word \\"jamboree\\" is derived from the Swahili for hello, Jambo!. Baden-Powell spent a considerable amount of time in the South African region in the 1880s then again in the late 1890s. =Current use in Scouting= The word \\"jamboree\\" is used primarily by the Scouting program following the first Boy Scout Jamboree in 1920. Baden-Powell deliberately chose the name \\"jamboree\\" where attendees were warmly welcomed attending this first Boy Scout rally or meeting with the word \\"Jambo!\\" The word jamboree in current English is used as a borrowed foreign word, with the ending -ree. The word jamboree is both a noun and a transitive verb, with a direct action of the root word jambo. For example, an attendee of a jambo is a jamboree. Many, at this first \\"Jamboree\\" or \\"Scout gathering\\" did not fully capture the spirit of this then-new concept or greeting. At the first \\"World Jamboree\\" at Olympia, London, in 1920, Baden- Powell said: > \\"People give different meanings for this word, but from this year on, > jamboree will take a specific meaning. It will be associated to the largest > gathering of youth that ever took place.\\" Olave Baden-Powell coined the term ' to refer to the lingua franca used between Scouts of different languages and cultural habits, that develops when diverse Scouts meet, that fosters friendship and understanding between Scouts of the world. Sometimes the word jamborette' is used to denote smaller, either local or international, gatherings. A similarly-used word \\"camporee\\" in the Scouting program is also reflective of the older British use. \\"Camporee\\" today reflects a local or regional gathering of Scouting units for a period of camping and common activities. Similar to a camporee, a jamboree occurs less often and draws units from the entire nation or world.

This was necessary because of the lack of educational training of many of the soldiers who decided to remain in the services after these two conflicts; many of these had joined the military at a young age and in many cases had not finished their education in the rush to help defend freedom in the world at that time.Canadian Army Badge With the above in mind, a program was designed and implemented where young men between the ages of 16 and 17 (no younger and no older) were recruited into a seven-year program of which the first two years were a combination of military training, trades training, and additional schooling. A half day of military and a half day of scholastic training were involved during most of this two-year time frame. A graduate after this two- year period usually had increased his educational level by two grades and was also trades trained to the Group 1 level in his chosen trade. Upon graduating after two years of intensive training, the apprentices were assigned to various military units and still had five years to serve with their option of taking their release after three years. Thus it was a minimum term of five years before one could officially take his release. Royal Canadian Air Force Ensign (1941-1968) Career as a soldier Many graduates made the military their lifelong career and obtained promotions well beyond the goals of the initial program and became officers, up to the rank of lieutenant-general in charge of Canadian Land Forces. Many artillery apprentice graduates changed their corps during their military careers and pursued very successful careers in other corps such as the Engineers, Dental Corps, Signal Corps, Intelligence Corps, Service Corps and the Royal Canadian Air Force among others. Leading into other careers Others left the military life after five to seven years and even later and pursued civilian careers with equal success in most cases. Civilian careers pursued, just to name a few, were careers in the chemical research field, hydraulics (where one individual holds several international patents on his designs), dental fields, prosthetics, insurance company executive, real estate, technicians at major airports, air traffic controllers and many others. One ( Richard Clarkson, E 29)became a supervisor with the US Department of Homeland Security in 2002, taking an oath administered by President George Bush in Philadelphia. Perhaps the longest serving apprentice in defense conditions. A Canadian military unit, returning from Iraq, presented him with a Ranger pin in a ceremony at Philadelphia Airport in 2004. Benefits The two-year portion of the apprentice training program molded the minds and formed the discipline of these young men to face life with a very positive approach and to achieve the goals that they set for themselves. It also formed a union that has lasted over 50 years that one can relate to when two apprentices meet again, even among other intakes formerly unknown. Graduates Most graduates of the program are emphatic in stating that they would do it all over again, and would recommend such a program for their children and grandchildren. Many members feel that they were well trained and given discipline and courage to face life even under the most trying of times. In 2003, 36 years after the last graduating class graduated and 49 years after the first Artillery Apprentices appeared in Shilo, Manitoba, the first ever all-intake reunion was held with great success. Another Artillery Apprentice all-intake reunion is planned in 2006. Apprentices from several other corps also hold reunions. The RCASC Soldier Apprentices conduct a tri yearly exercise aptly named \\"Operation Greenflash\\" in Camp Borden Ont in Late August. This year \\"Op Greenflash\\" will be held the weekend of Aug 25, 2012.

Malloy came to talk radio in 1987, moving from his position as a writer and producer at CNN. He is married to producer Kathy Bay, with whom he has a daughter born in July, 2004. He has an additional five children, all grown, and six grandchildren. The show features Malloy's extended monologues on the day's news and the people and events behind it, listener calls, and occasional guest interviews. He advocates for the Democratic Party to move to the left and to take more liberal and progressive stands. Malloy's radio style is very confrontational and sometimes controversial: he is an advocate for the open discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories, for the impeachment of George W. Bush and the ousting of what he calls \\"spineless democrats\\" from the U.S. Congress. Malloy refers to his audience as \\"Truthseekers\\". Malloy often collectively refers to George W. Bush, his father, and their associates as the \\"Bush Crime Family\\".bush crime family tree Malloy's show is currently self-syndicated. Until March 2009 it was syndicated by the Nova M Radio network. Previously, it was syndicated by Air America Radio, but Air America abruptly dropped the show on August 30, 2006. The Mike Malloy Show is currently carried by 13 broadcast stations as well as the Sirius XM Progress satellite radio channel nationwide. Its broadcast originates from Atlanta, Georgia. Malloy is the only radio talk show host in America to have received the A.I.R (Achievement in Radio) Award in both Chicago and New York City.The Mike Malloy Show - Speaking Truth to Power Talkers Magazine included Malloy among their list of \\"the 250 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\\" but did not name him as one of the Heavy Hundred.\\" Broadcast history After years on WSB in Atlanta and WLS in Chicago, the show launched into national syndication on Air America Radio August 2, 2004 and was broadcast live on weeknights from 10 p.m.-1 a.m. Eastern Time on some Air America affiliates. In January 2006, Malloy's show was removed from WLIB, Air America's New York City affiliate. He was replaced by the apolitical Satellite Sisters' show. On August 11, 2006, he announced his pending return to WLIB on September 1, 2006, barring no unforeseen difficulties. However, unforeseen difficulties did indeed arise. On August 30, 2006 the following notice appeared on his web site: At the time, Malloy was not doing his show, but substituting for Randi Rhodes on her show. In an interview on The Majority Report that aired on September 8, 2006, Mike explained that he was fired for \\"financial reasons.\\" He said he was looking for another place to do his show, and while he would like to come back to Air America, he would never do so while the current management was in place due to the unprofessional way he was fired.

Jargon  = Catchphrases = Malloy is frequently heard employing a number of catch phrases that have become trademarks of his style, among them are: * \\"Have I mentioned yet tonight how much I hate these people?\\" - In reference to right-wingers. * \\"Maaaaaarge!\\" - Mike's excited introduction of Marge, a senior single mother from Merrillville, Indiana, who was a popular regular caller since Malloy's days at WLS.

Malloy, since moving his program to internet-only, has abandoned some above-mentioned minced oaths in favor of using explicit language.  Notable episodes  On May 9, 2003, a weekly segment named Bush-Free Fridays was supposed to start on the show, where neither Malloy or any callers to the show would mention George W. Bush by name. The segment was not successful, as even Malloy himself at one point mentioned Bush by name and joked about leaving the studio during the show. On November 9, 2007, Malloy played a segment from The O'Reilly Factor where host Bill O'Reilly did a segment on Malloy, about a comment he had made earlier on the show about having \\"violence fantasies\\" about Scott McClellan and Dana Perino. Malloy ridiculed O'Reilly on-air as the segment was playing, and later mentioned the case where a visitor on O'Reilly's blog said that \\"his guns were loaded\\" if Hillary Clinton should become President. On June 2009 Interviewed by Brad Friedman, Former FBI translator and Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has stated : \\"I have information about things that our government has lied to us about. I know. For example, to say that since the fall of the Soviet Union we ceased all of our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and the Taliban - those things can be proven as lies, very easily, based on the information they classified in my case, because we did carry very intimate relationship with these people, and it involves Central Asia, all the way up to September 11.\\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7253 On May 4, 2011, Malloy made remarks regarding the killing of Usama Bin Laden, stating: > All the death in Iraq was not caused by bin Laden.

The comment drew critical national attention. Following the tornado outbreak of March 2‚Äì3, 2012, on March 4, 2012, Malloy again received much criticism over remarks he made mocking the religion of the tornado victims: \\"They keep being killed, you know, their God, if this is where they want to look at it, keeps smashing them into little grease spots on the pavement...the Bible Belt.

Described as a prolific and professional inventor, he held over 200 patents, mostly related to optics and electronics. His most significant inventions were a pioneering flight simulator, arguably the first ATM and improvement to the teleprompter. Early life Simjian was born in Aintab, Ottoman Empire to Armenian parents on January 28, 1905. His father, George, was an insurance broker working for an Austrian company. His mother, Josephine (n√©e Zaharian) died when he was only a few months old. His father later remarried and he had two half-sisters. Simjian lived in Aintab until the age of nine. In 1915, during the Armenian Genocide, the Simjian family fled to Aleppo, Syria, only to return to Aintab in 1920. His stepmother and half-sisters were killed in Marash. Simjian fled to Beirut, then to France and eventually to the United States by the end of 1920. He first settled in New Haven, Connecticut, living with an uncle. He found a job coloring photographs. He graduated from the Booth Preparatory School in New Haven. Yale and early inventions Simjian began working as a technician at the Yale School of Medicine in a work-study position at the photography lab. While initially having been inclined to pursue medical education, he eventually decided to pursue photography. In his position of a medical photographer, Simjian \\"took pictures of specimens, made lantern slides for doctors, and showed the slides for class lectures.\\" In 1928 Simjian founded and became the first director of the photography department at the Yale School of Medicine. He headed it until 1934. After resigning from Yale in 1934, he moved to New York City and took courses at Columbia University \\"that he felt would be useful in the promotion of his inventions, focusing on business education, writing, and international banking.\\" =Self-photographing and self-focusing camera= Simjian's \\"Self-focusing camera\\" (1931) Simjian's interest in portrait photography led to him inventing a self-photographing (PhotoReflex) camera. He was inspired to invent it from his unhappiness with the repetitive nature of yearbook portraits. In 1929 he applied for patent for the \\"Pose- reflecting system for photographic apparatus.\\" It was covered early on by the Popular Science magazine in 1929. It allowed the \\"subject to look into a mirror and see the framed pose the camera would take.\\" To manufacture the new product, Simjian collaborated with Sperry Gyroscope to set up PhotoReflex, a company named after the camera itself. In 1931 the camera was introduced at the Wanamaker's department store in New York City contained within a portrait cabinet. Within the booth, people could see the \\"reflexive production of images of the self in real time.\\" It was widely covered in the press at the time.Nation's Business - Volume 19 - Page 19. 1931 \\"... proper lighting effects. Self-photography is now possible by means of the so-called ‚Äúphoto- reflex‚Äù device perfected by Luther Simjian of Yale University. The image of the subject is seen in a mirror in the exact size it will be in the finished print.\\"Photo-era Magazine - Volume 67 - Page 52. 1931 \\"... invited guests by Luther J. Simjian, director of the photographic laboratory of the School of Medicine at Yale University. Although the studio and apparatus embody new ideas in photography, Mr. Simjian says that the most important advance ...\\"The Popular Science Monthly - Volume 119 - Page 46. 1931 \\"A studio in which you can pose your own portrait was demonstrated in New York City recently by its inventor, Luther G. Simjian, photographic director of the Yale medical School. Visitors enter a small room alone and try the effect of different ...\\" The self-photographing camera led to the invention of the autofocus (self- focusing) camera by Simjian. He applied for patent in June 1931 and was granted one for the \\"Self-focusing camera\\" in July 1932. It \\"changed the whole photography industry,\\" but he did not \\"receive much money for his autofocusing invention, but he did get publicity. He eventually sold the rights to the PhotoReflex camera and name but reserved the rights to use the technology for non-photographic applications.\\" =Color X-ray= In June 1934 he was granted a patent for a color X-ray machine. He had applied for it in March 1932. He had \\"conceived the idea at Yale while trying to improve the quality of lecture slides. He decided to apply the new technology of television to X-ray images. Scanning was done in three separate colors, each of which could be enhanced as necessary, and the three scans could then be recombined to form a colored image. The separate scans could also be sent through a wire to another location for analysis. This transformed the field of X-ray technology.\\" The was reported by Time Magazine and The Literary Digest in July 1934. Simjian thereafter traveled to Europe and established a laboratory in London and Miroflex, a company to produce the PhotoReflex camera. However, his plans were disrupted by World War II as the focus of production shifted from commercial to military. Reflectone and flight simulator In 1939 Simjian founded Reflectone Corporation (later renamed to Reflectone Electronics, Inc.) in Stamford, Connecticut, to develop and manufacture his inventions. He served as president and chairman of Reflectone until he sold the company to Universal Match Corporation in 1961. Under his leadership, the company achieved \\"significant commercial success.\\" One of the first inventions in Reflectone was a rotating chair with a movable mirror to be used for women when applying cosmetics. \\"The user could sit in front of a vanity mirror, rotate on this chair and continue to see the back of her head while keeping both hands free.\\" The chair was marketed as Reflectone Mirror Chair and was a \\"small commercial success.\\" Also during his time at Reflectone, Simjian invented a method to develop a photo \\"immediately while still preserving the negative.\\" Simjian's \\"Training apparatus\\" (1943) During World War II, Simjian invented a training apparatus for aviators. It was the \\"first flight simulator of its kind.\\" He filed for patent in February 1943 and was granted a patent for it in January 1946. It was a \\"mechanism used for training aviators in identifying aircraft or ships, in determining the speed of movement of aircraft, direction of movement, and other related factors that are important in combat flying.\\" \\"He designed the three-dimensional device using synchronized mirrors similar to those on his PhotoReflex camera and mirror chair, an airplane model, and controlled lighting. By remotely changing the speed and angles of the model plane while the pilot or gunner watched through a sight, the instructor could produce the effect of flight, thus training the student to identify an enemy aircraft and judge its motion.\\" During the war, Reflectone sold over 2,000 of these devices to the U.S. military. The company grew exponentially to manufacture the orders for this trainer with the number of employees rising from three to over 100 and to 250 by 1950. The War Department credited the device \\"with having contributed to the success of the air war.\\" Simjian considered it his \\"most significant invention of the era because of the many lives it saved.\\" He received a citation from Admiral Bill Halsey saying his device had saved thousands American servicemen's lives. Reflectone moved its operations to Tampa, Florida in 1980 and was sold to BAE Systems (British Aerospace) for $90 million in 1997, and renamed BAE Systems Flight Simulation and Training. As of 1997 the company still made \\"full-flight simulators for commercial and military aircraft.\\" In 2001 BAE Systems sold the subsidiary to CAE Inc. (Canadian Aviation Electronics) for $80 million. Later inventions After Reflectone, Simjian founded General Research Inc. and Command Automation Inc., the latter was a research and development lab in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His later inventions were increasingly diverse and eclectic. He noted: \\"One thing I discovered about myself in the early days of my life is that I can't stick with just one idea for too long.\\" =Teleprompter= Simjian's \\"Prompting device\\" (1955) Simjian held a patent on the teleprompter. However, he is not its sole inventor. The invention of the teleprompter is usually credited to Hubert Schlafly, an engineer working with CBS and Fred Barton, an actor, who developed a mechanical cueing device in the 1950s. Simjian and Jess Oppenheimer, the creator and producer of the classic sitcom I Love Lucy, improved it and replaced it with an optical teleprompter. Hayward wrote that the advantage of the optical teleprompter proposed by Simjian and Oppenheimer was \\"its ability to break down the division between the viewer and person on camera by allowing for direct eye contact on the part of the presenter with the camera aperture.\\" The prompting device was applied for patent in 1955 and it was granted in 1957. Hayward argues that: = Bankograph (ATM) = Simjian invented what has been described as a precursor of the automated teller machine (ATM). For this, Simjian is often considered the inventor of the ATM or the one who first came up with the idea. The entry on Simjian in the American National Biography noted that he is \\"sometimes referred to as the 'father of the ATM' because he introduced the idea behind these now-ubiquitous machines.\\" According to history.com, \\"Many experts believe that the first automated banking machine was the creation\\" of Simjian. According to Konheim, Simjian \\"came up with the idea of creating a 'hole-in- the wall machine' that would allow customers to make financial transactions.\\" Hayward notes that Simjian's role in the invention of the ATM is disputed, however, he is recognized as the \\"inventor of a photomechanical automated banking terminal,\\" popularly known as the Bankograph. Simjian's \\"Subscriber controlled apparatus\\" (1959) Simjian was granted over 20 patents for the Bankograph. His \\"Apparatus for collecting an article for deposit\\" (filed in 1958) was granted in late March 1960. It was covered by the New York Times, which described it as a \\"robot bank teller that gives the depositor a picture of the money he puts in. There can never be any question as to the number and bills to be credited to his account.\\" Simjian filed for a patent for \\"Subscriber controlled apparatus\\" in 1959. In 1960 Simjian filed for patent a device that incorporated an ATM photographing the deposited check. Described as \\"less than a full-function ATM,\\" the Bankograph was an automatic deposit machine that accepted cash and check deposits at all times. A camera inside the machine took snapshots of the deposits, copies of which were given to the customers as receipts. He introduced it to the wider public in 1961, when it was placed in a few City Bank of New York bank lobbies for six months. The company discontinued its use due to limited appeal. Simjian wrote in his autobiography: \\"It seems the only people who were using the machines were a small number of prostitutes and gamblers who didn't want to deal with tellers face to face. And the bank said there were not enough of them to make the deal lucrative.\\" Hayward argues that the Bankograph was ultimately a failure \\"because of its evasion of established norms of visuality associated with banking at the time.\\" Konheim described it as \\"perhaps the first ATM\\" and \\"an early and not-very-successful prototype of an ATM.\\" The New York Times wrote in 1998 that it was his most famous invention and \\"the basis for the now- ubiquitous A.T.M., from which he never made a penny.\\" =Other= Simjian's other inventions included an indoor computerized golf practice range (1960s), an exercise bicycle that massages the rider (1973), a remotely accessed automatic postage meter (1981) that was purchased by Pitney Bowes, a meat tenderizing method, golf balls, cooking devices, the use of ultrasound as an anticounterfeiting device, an athletic shoe, and a bandage. He also revisited and improved some of his earlier inventions. His eyesight declined significantly in his last years. However, he still made inventions with his last patent being granted several months before his death. Personal life and death Simjian spoke Arabic, French and English. He spoke English with a \\"thick accent.\\" His interests included golf, backgammon, Mark Twain's works, porcelains, Middle Eastern food. He married Gladys (n√©e Cannon) in April 1936. They had met at a party in Greenwich Village in 1935. They had two children: Maryjo Garre and Ronald Simjian. Simjian died aged 92 on October 23, 1997 at his beachfront apartment in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Legacy and recognition  The American National Biography describes him as a \\"pioneer in photographic and optical inventions.\\" Simjian avoided publicity and never became a public figure. He was \\"so private few people would recognize his name,\\" wrote Ardy Friedberg in the Sun-Sentinel in 1997. Simjian self-published Portions of an Autobiography in 1997 just before his death. During his seven-decade long career as a professional inventor, Simjian received over 200 American and foreign patents. After his death, he was compared to Thomas Edison.World Book Encyclopedia, World Book Inc. - 1998, p. 176 \\"Simjian, Luther G. (1905-October 23), inventor regarded as \\"the second Thomas Edison,\\" who held more than 200 patents that included the automated teller machine and the self-focusing camera...\\" Friedberg described his life as \\"a bona fide American success story\\". His long-time patent agent, Ervin Steinberg, noted that Simjian was \\"one of the most prolific inventors of [the 20th] century.\\" Hayward argued that his \\"career as an inventor highlights the extent to which the optical retains significance in the contemporary era.\\" =Awards= *The Award of Appreciation from the State of Florida, 1961 *In June 1963 the Science Digest magazine named Simjian Inventor of the Month.Science Digest (1963) Volume 54, Issue 6, page 56. \\"Luther G. Simjian has 132 U.S. patents to his credit. The Science Digest Inventor of the Month is also president of Reflectone Electronics, and is on the board of Universal Match Corp.\\" *In 1978 Simjian received the Eli Whitney Award by the Connecticut Patent Law Association (currently the Connecticut Intellectual Property Law Association, CIPLA) \\"in recognition of significant contribution to law or science.\\" *In 2019 Simjian was inducted into the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame. For that occasion, he was named by Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) on House floor on July 24, 2019.

Cimbri, Ambrone and Teuton defeats. Cimbri, Ambrone and Teuton victories. The Ambrones () were an ancient tribe mentioned by Roman authors. They are generally believed to have been a Germanic tribe from Jutland. In the late 2nd century BC, along with the fellow Cimbri and Teutons, the Ambrones migrated from their original homes and invaded the Roman Republic, winning a spectacular victory at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC. The Ambrones and the Teutons, led by Teutobod, were eventually defeated at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae in 102 BC. Origins The Ambrones are generally classified as a Germanic tribe. Celtic influences have been suggested, but this is controversial. The exact location of the homeland of the Ambrones is unknown. Their name has been connected to the islands of Fehmarn, old name Imbria, and Amrum. If so they may be the Ymbers of Widsith. However the inundation of the Wadden Sea region during this period suggests that they lived west of Jutland, not east of Jutland. The river Emmer, formerly Ambriuna, has also been mentioned as their place of origin. History The three neighbors began their career in Roman history as an alliance determined to emigrate to the lands of the south. A Roman source reports that \\"The Cimbri, Teutones and Tigurini, fugitives from the extreme parts of Gaul, since the Ocean had inundated their territories, began to seek new settlement throughout the world.\\" The Zuider Zee region was suffering from catastrophic salt-water flooding; this section of seacoast had been barely above sea level during the BCE period of human history, but was now in the process of sinking below it. The Ambrones were part of the fleeing multitude. Plutarch gives the numbers advancing on Italy as 300,000 armed fighting men, and much larger hordes of women and children. (Many of Plutarch's figures were enormous exaggerations). The Barbarians divided themselves into two bands, and it fell to the lot of the Cimbri to proceed through Noricum in the interior of the country against Catulus, and of a passage there, while the Teutones and Ambrones were to march through Liguria along the sea-coast against the consul Gaius Marius, who had set up camp on the Rh√¥ne. Plutarch tells us that Ambrones alone numbered more than 30,000 and were the most warlike division of the enemy, who had earlier defeated the Romans under Gnaeus Mallius Maximus and Quintus Servilius Caepio.Plutarch, Lives: Life of Marius. The Ambrones followed a custom observed amongst Celts in the shouting the name of their tribe going into battle. It was the Battle of Arausio in 105 in which the Romans were defeated under Servilius Caepio and Gnaeus Mallius.Livy, Periochae, book 67. The Teutones and Ambrones assaulted the camp of Marius and were repulsed. They decided to go on and streamed around the camp, giving the Roman soldiers messages for the wives they should encounter as domestics when enslaved. Marius followed swiftly and again encamped next to them at Aquae Sextiae at the foot of the Alps. The year was 102 BC.Plutarch, Lives: Life of Marius; Livy, Periochae, book 68. The battle began as a chance encounter but the Romans turned it into a victory. Roman camp followers attempting to draw water from a nearby river were attacked by the Ambrones, who were still using it. The Ligurians acting as Roman auxiliaries came to their rescue and were repulsed across the river. The opportunity was not lost on Marius. The Romans quickly formed ranks and caught the Ambrones trying to recross the river. The Ambrones lost the main part of their force.Lucius Annaeus Florus, The Epitome of Roman History, book I, part 38. Two days later Marius repulsed an attack on the camp and caught the enemy force between his own main force in the front and an ambush of 3,000 men under the command of Marcus Claudius Marcellus who Marius had sent under the cover of darkness the night before the battle in order to strike the enemy rear. This new threat caused a panic and in short time the army collapsed into rout.In The Name of Rome pg. 148-149- Adrian Goldsworthy Plutarch reported that Marius took 100,000 prisoners, though this is likely exaggerated. Plutarch, Lives: Life of Marius. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War. Although Caesar mentions that the remnants of the Cimbri and Teutones formed a new tribe in Belgic Gaul, the Atuatuci, he does not mention any remnants of the Ambrones.Caesar, Gallic War, book 2, chapter 29.

The group originated in Puerto Varas, Chile and by 2009 had relocated to V√§ster√•s, Sweden.  Biography  It was initially a solo project until Frater D. decided to make a band of it and so joins guitarist √Öskv√§der the band in September 1999. During their first ten years of existence, a couple of albums were recorded and a handful of gigs were performed in their homeland of Chile. Various line-up changes occurred as well. The band had a brief hiatus for various reasons, but in 2009 after resurfacing in Sweden and the city of V√§ster√•s, Hetroertzen's first proclaimed full-length album Exaltation of Wisdom, was recorded at the band's own studio. The line-up was then Frater D. on drums, bass and vocals and √Öskv√§der on guitars. Exaltation of Wisdom was at first released on LP by Lamech Records and was limited to 500 blood-numbered copies. In November 2011 the group performed Exaltation of Wisdom in its entirety in their most important performance thus far; a rather special event called Arosian Black Mass, where the band received highly positive critique from attendants. The band had the help from Kfzl on bass and Garghuf on drums. After their live debut at Arosian Black Mass, some line-up changes occurred, and Anubis gets involved in the band as guitarist. At the beginning of 2012 Frater D., √Öskv√§der and Anubis went on to record new material for what would be used for a split album together with Norwegian devotees D√∏dsengel. The split, under the title Capax Infiniti, gained much regard in terms of acceptance from the audience from all around the world, as well as in terms of sales. In October 2013 the band went out on their first ever tour, alongside black metal legends Troll and D√∏dheimsgard. The tour was a success for the band and they won over countless new fans from all around Europe. During 2014 Hetroertzen recorded material for a new full-length album which allowed them to stretch the boundaries of their already unique sound. Ain Soph Aur saw the light in December 2014 receiving a great response from the devotees and the media. Ain Soph Aur was released on all format by the collaboration of Lamech Records, Terratur Possessions and Amor Fati Productions. At the beginning of 2015, Ham joins the band as a permanent bass player. In the fall of 2015 Hetroertzen visited the US for the first time and performed two very exclusive shows in New York City and Baltimore along with Ominous Resurrection and their brethren LvxCaelis. Also in 2015, the band confirmed to do a one-week tour in October along with French devotees Malhkebre and Malepeste.

The town has a population of 2,898, while ≈Ωiti≈°te municipality has 16,786 inhabitants. Name In Serbian, the town is known as ≈Ωiti≈°te (Cyrillic: –ñ–∏—Ç–∏—à—Ç–µ), in Romanian as Jiti»ôte or Ziti»ôte, in German as Sankt Georgen an der Bega, and in Hungarian as B√©gaszentgy√∂rgy or Begaszentgy√∂rgy. The Serbian name of the town derived from the Serbian word \\"≈æito\\" (\\"wheat\\" in English). Its old names used in Serbian were Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë and Senƒëuraƒë. The Hungarian name of the town derived from the Hungarian family name Szentgy√∂rgyi. History ≈Ωiti≈°te was founded in the 14th century during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, under the name of Zenthgyurgh (Szentgy√∂rgyi). In 1660/1666, it was called Senƒëuraƒë, which was recorded as a settlement repopulated by ethnic Serbs during Ottoman rule. In the beginning of the 18th century, the settlement was completely abandoned and in 1723 it was recorded as an uninhabited heath. It was settled again in 1724 by Serb and Romanian settlers. In 1736/37, the settlement had 27 houses. Because of the Austro-Turkish war (1736‚Äì1739) and pestilence, the number of inhabitants decreased and in 1740 the population of the settlement numbered 18 houses. In 1753, Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë was settled by 1,000 Serb frontiersmen from Pomori≈°je, Potisje and Veliki Beƒçkerek, and in the same year it was recorded on map as a \\"Serb- inhabited settlement\\". In 1758, Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë had 45 houses, and in 1773 it had 182 houses. Its church was built in 1758, and it was also used as a school. In 1781, Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë became a property of Isak Ki≈° (Kis Izs√°k), who was a trader of Armenian origin. In 1800-1805, the settlement was moved to another location closer to the Begej river. Part of the Serb population moved from the settlement and settled in the Military Frontier, while German colonists settled in Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë instead of them. Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë was a municipality until 1877, when it was joined to the municipality of Veliki Beƒçkerek. In 1880, the population of the settlement numbered 3,041 people, of whom 1,983 were Catholics, 1,033 were Orthodox, 19 were Jews, and 6 were others. In accordance with the census made in 1910, the linguistic distribution of the 2,814 inhabitants included 1,454 who spoke German, 1,034 who spoke Serbian and 214 who spoke Hungarian. In 1931, the population of Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë included 1,318 inhabitants who spoke the German language, 1,055 who spoke the Serbian language, 188 who spoke the Hungarian language, 34 who spoke other Slavic languages, and 94 who spoke other languages. In 1940, population of Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë numbered 3,055 people, of whom 1,642 were Orthodox, 1,387 were Catholics, 16 were Jews, and 10 were others. As a consequence of World War II and Axis occupation, the German population left or was evicted from Begej Sveti ƒêuraƒë after the war, while 270 Serb families from Bosanska Krajina came to the settlement. In 1947, the name of the settlement was officially changed to ≈Ωiti≈°te. In 1960, ≈Ωiti≈°te became a seat of its municipality. On 2 July 2016, a man killed his wife in a mass shooting that occurred at a local cafe. Four others were also killed and an additional 22 were injured.

She is a specialist in short distances races in freestyle and butterfly. She is coached by former Swedish swimmer Johan Wallberg. She is the first female swimmer and the third overall (after Lars Fr√∂lander and Derya B√ºy√ºkuncu) to participate in six Olympic Games. Biography Alshammar was born in Solna in 1977, daughter of 7th placed Olympic breaststroke swimmer Britt-Marie Smedh and Krister Alshammar. She started swimming on the team of Sundbybergs IK. At the beginning of her career she was a backstroke swimmer and in 1991, the year Alshammar turned 14, she won her first national short course title on 50 m backstroke at the 1991 Swedish Short Course Swimming Championships. The year after, when she was 14 years old, she won her first national long course senior title, 100 m backstroke at the 1992 Swedish Swimming Championships representing J√§rf√§lla SS. Alshammar was a part of the Swedish team in 1993 European Championships in Sheffield, finishing fourth in the 100 m backstroke final, and in the inaugural World Short Course Championships in Palma de Mallorca.

To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included well-known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, Ricky Busquet. Alshammar won her first international medal, a bronze in the 50 m freestyle, at the 1997 European Championships. She developed this stroke into her speciality and won the silver at the 1999 European Championships. She broke through to the top ranks at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney where she won silver medals in the 50 m and 100 m freestyle, both times vanquished by Inge de Bruijn, and a bronze medal with the Swedish relay team. Since Sydney, she has been a favourite at major international events over short distances. At the World Championships in 2001 she won two silver medals, this time in the 50 m freestyle and 50 m butterfly. In the 2002 European Championships in Berlin she won the 50 m freestyle. In 2003, she let up to focus on the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. In her only start in the 50 m, she barely missed a medal, coming fourth in the 50 m freestyle.

She took her first gold medal in 1991. On 17 March 2009, at the Australian Swimming Titles, she broke her own world record in the 50-meter butterfly with a time of 25.44. She was later disqualified by Swimming Australia for wearing two swimsuits. FINA, swimming's governing body, had ratified a new rule only 17 days previously that swimmers can only wear one suit. Alshammar initially appealed the disqualification but withdrew the appeal when the new rule was explained to her.Alshammer Disqualified Yahoo Sports, 17 March 2009 On 31 July 2011 she won the gold medal at 50 meter freestyle at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships, making her the oldest woman to win an individual gold medal at the long-course world championships.

The school was named for its wealthy benefactor, Lewis B. Parsons Sr., and was founded in 1875 with one building and 34 students. Over the years new buildings were constructed as enrollment expanded. The school lost its accreditation in 1948 but regained it two years later. In 1955 the school appointed Millard G. Roberts as its president and this began a period of rapid expansion with the student population rising as high as 5,000 by 1966. There was a turning point, however, in 1966 when Life magazine published an article criticizing the college and its president. Later that year the school lost its accreditation and Roberts was asked to resign as president. Enrollment quickly declined and the college floundered with $14 million in debt and closed under bankruptcy in 1973. History =1875 to 1954= Parsons College was named for Lewis B. Parsons, Sr., a wealthy New York merchant who died in 1855 and left much of his estate as an endowment for an institution of higher learning in Iowa. His sons, the executors of Parsons' estate, considered a number of possible locations for the school and 20 years laterGoff, Rory and Rena (November 2012) Remembering Barhydt Chapel, Iowa Source, page F-1 chose a tract of land just north of Fairfield.Gabbert, Dean (June 1, 1973) Life And Death Of A College, The Fairfield Ledger The residents of Fairfield promised $27,516 towards the college, and its committee paid W.H. Jordan $13,000 for Henn Mansion building and 20 acres of land. Ewing Hall in 1934 O.B. (Oscar Bernard) Nelson, coach The college opened in 1875 with 34 students who attended classes in the brick home called \\"the Mansion\\" that was built in 1857 by Congressman Bernhart Henn. The faculty were three Presbyterian ministers and enrollment grew to 63 students by year end. Alexander G. Wilson was in charge of faculty and held the title of \\"rector.\\" He also oversaw the college's preparatory department, which later became the Parsons Academy until its closure in 1917. A $7,000 chapel building was erected in 1876, and John Armstrong succeeded Wilson and assumed the title of college president, until August 12, 1879, when he died suddenly. The third president was Thomas Davis Ewing, who served from 1880 to 1890; the Mansion was later renamed Ewing Hall in his honor. A west wing was added to the chapel in 1882 by Des Moines architects Bell & Hackney, and an east wing was added in 1890-91 with a $15,000 donation from W. R. Ankeny of Des Moines, for whom the chapel was renamed Ankeny Hall.http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/maharishi-university-time- travel-to-parsons-college/ The first football game played at Parsons was on September 16, 1893. Parsons won by a score of 70-0. This monumental win prompted the construction of Blum stadium for the 1894 season. In 1896 Daniel E. Jenkins became college president at the age of 30 and was the youngest of the 16 who held the title during the school's 98-year history. Ankeny Hall contained the chapel, the library, and the classrooms when it was destroyed by fire in August 1902, leaving the college with only two buildings: Henn Mansion and a newly constructed women's dormitory called Ballard Hall. The college rebounded by raising funds from board members and other local residents for new construction. In 1903 Fairfield Hall and Foster Hall were completed and the Carnegie Library was opened in 1907 due in part to a donation from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. These new buildings were in the Beaux Arts- style and were designed by Chicago architect Henry K. Holsman. In 1908, college trustee Theodore Wells Barhydt donated $33,000 for a chapel, which was built in Norman Gothic style and designed by Holsman. It was completed in 1909 and named the Barhydt Memorial Chapel in honor of Barhydt's parents. The chapel included $1,800 worth of art-glass windows. The Trustee Gymnasium opened in 1910 and later an extension to the chapel called the Bible Building and later renamed Parsons Hall. Enrollment steadily increased after World War I but declined during the World War II years, and in 1948 Parsons lost its accreditation. The college was strengthened by appointment of college President Tom E. Shearer in 1948, and it regained accreditation in 1950. =1955 to 1973= Blum Stadium, October 22, 1966 vs. Delta State In 1955, the trustees appointed a Presbyterian minister from New York City, Millard G. Roberts, as president of the 357-student college. Over the years, Roberts was both hailed and criticized for his flamboyant management style. His first objective was to increase enrollment, and for ten years Parsons College allegedly had the highest percentage of enrollment increase nationwide. When the number of students reached 1,000, new dormitories were built to keep up with the demand. Roberts instituted the multi-pronged Parsons Plan. Features included: * Division of the year into three 4-month trimesters. This gave students more time to delve deeply into their classes. * Establishment of the Summer Fine Arts Festival. Each of the three trimesters carried equal academic weight, but the summer trimester included unique art, music, dance, and theater class and performance offerings not available at other times of the year. (Because each trimester carried equal academic weight, students who had to take a term off to work could do so during any term, thereby avoiding the competition for summer jobs.) * Division of the student body into three cohorts. The top tier, comprising academic \\"stars\\", were offered full scholarships; the bottom two tiers, comprising average and below-average students who couldn't get into (or had flunked out of) other colleges, paid full tuition. * The Tutorial system, whereby lectures were conducted by doctorate professors two or three times a week. On the other days of the week, students met with Masters-level tutors who conducted smaller discussion- oriented sessions; students thereby met five days a week. * Admission was offered to marginal students right out of high school, who otherwise might not have been able to go to college, as well as to students who had flunked out of other colleges. Among Roberts's innovations was the establishment of the trimester system, which made possible year-round use of the facility and allowed students to reduce the time needed to obtain a degree. He lowered admission requirements and Parsons became known as a school that gave students a second chance. He increased the student-teacher ratio, slashed the academic curriculum, and established recruiters around the country. In 1962, six professors filed a formal complaint against the college. The North Central Association (NCA) conducted an investigation and put the college on probation in 1963. In 1964 student enrollment reached 2,500; the probation was lifted in 1965, and enrollment reached 5,000 students in 1966. Roberts reportedly raided other campuses for \\"strong faculty\\" by offering higher salaries and more benefits. By 1966 the college had the third highest-paid faculty in the nation. However, despite huge increases in enrollment, the college debt increased by an average of $100,000 per month during the 12 years that Roberts was president. Aerial View in 1964 In 1966 Life Magazine published an article criticizing Roberts and the college, calling him \\"The Wizard of Flunk Out U\\". In 1966, a new football stadium, Blum Stadium was dedicated. In 1967 the NCA revoked the college's accreditation citing \\"administrative weakness\\" and a $14 million debt. Roberts responded with threats of a lawsuit, but the faculty voted 101 to 58 to remove Roberts from his position. In June 1967 the board of trustees asked for his resignation. William B. Munson became acting president for two months and was succeeded by Wayne E. Stamper, who served from 1967-1968. The school played its final season of football in 1970. Within a year enrollment had dropped to 2,000 students. The school's enrollment plunged from 5,000 to 1,500, and though accreditation was regained in the spring of that year, the upheaval of the late 1960s had fatally undermined its reputation. In 1973, Everett E. Hadley became acting president of the college. Two innovative programs, \\"Foreign Language - Foreign Service Institute\\" and \\"Religious Service Community,\\" attracted new students. However, enrollment dropped to 925 students, the school went into bankruptcy and finally closed in 1973.Nelson, Bryce (July 9, 1973) \\"The Death of a College -- Grand Idea That Failed\\", The Los Angeles Times Over the years Roberts had created satellite colleges that operated under the leadership of Parsons. They were Lea College in Albert Lea, Minn., John J. Pershing College in Beatrice, Neb.; Charles City College in Charles City, Iowa; College of Artesia in Artesia, N.M.; Hiram Scott College in Scottsbluff, Neb.; and Midwestern College in Denison, Iowa.

Biography =Early life and education= Houston was born in New York City to Mary Todaro Houston who was of Sicilian descent, and Jack Houston who was related to Sam Houston of Texas.Houston, Jean 1996 A Mythic Life. New York: Harper Collins Her father was a comedy writer who developed material for stage, television and the movies, including for comedians Bob Hope and George Burns. His work required him, and the family, to move frequently. After the breakup of her parents' marriage, she spent her teen years in New York City. Houston attended Barnard College in New York City in the class of 1958. She subsequently earned a Ph.D. in Psychology from Union Graduate School and a Ph.D. in Religion from the Graduate Theological Foundation. =Career= While participating in a US Government sanctioned research project on the effects of LSD, Houston became acquainted with Robert Masters, a writer and researcher into the varieties of human behavior and potentials. The two married in 1965 and soon became known for their work in the Human Potential Movement. Together they conducted research into the interdependence of body, mind, and spirit at The Foundation for Mind Research for 14 years. The psychedelic experience research Houston and Masters conducted culminated in the 1966 publication of The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience. The U.S. government banned psychedelic research that same year. This classic in psychedelic studies detailed the expanded cognition and creativity participants experienced under the influence of LSD. After the research ban, Houston and Masters shifted their focus to explore other ways of achieving altered states of consciousness without the use of drugs. Houston and Masters' 1972 book Mind Games detailed their findings that guided imagery and specific programs of bodily movement could reprogram the brain toward more integrated ways of experiencing the world. John Lennon called Mind Games \\"one of the two most important books of our time.\\" Houston taught at Marymount College, Tarrytown from 1965 to 1972.https://books.google.com/books?id=leIjcCSB_MoC&pg;=PA131 She was a lecturer at Hunter College for less than a year in 1961. Her interest in anthropology brought about a close association with Margaret Mead, who lived with Houston and Masters for several years before her death in 1978. In 1982, Houston began teaching a seminar based on the concept of \\"the ancient mystery schools.\\"Scott London, \\"On Soul, Shadow and the American Psyche: An Interview with Jean Houston,\\" Salt Journal (November/December 1997), portions of this interview were broadcast on the NPR series \\"Insight & Outlook.\\" Houston explores the ancient idea of entelechy and proposes that individuals possess an innate potentiality which motivates their experience and actions. A technique she advocates for acknowledging and developing this inner spiritual self involves imagining the realization of one's potential in full embodied form in order to integrate it with one's present physical self. Controversy During the first term (1993‚Äì1997) of the Clinton administration, First Lady Hillary Clinton, while she was writing It Takes a Village (1996), invited Houston to work with her in the White House as an advisor. Houston facilitated a creative thinking, role-playing exercise wherein Clinton engaged in imaginary dialogues with Gandhi and Eleanor Roosevelt. Bob Woodward's book The Choice revealed this exercise publicly in 1996. After both the New York Post and the Daily News labeled Houston \\"Hillary's Guru\\" and the Boston Herald dubbed her the \\"First Lady's Spiritual Adviser\\", People reported that Houston had \\"suddenly found herself the hapless butt of a thousand gags.\\" When the media subsequently \\"beat a path to her door,\\" she was compelled to explain, \\"There was no s√©ance!

He is the author of the Alexanderlied (‚ÄúSong of Alexander‚Äù), the first German epic composed on a French model. Biography Of him practically nothing personal is known but his name, the fact that he was a cleric, and that he wrote his poem around 1130. According to the poet's own statement, the model for his poem was a French poem on Alexander the Great by Alb√©ric de Besan√ßon. Only a portion of the beginning of the French original, 105 verses in all, is preserved (discovered and published by Paul Heyse, Berlin, 1856). The poem contained a fabulous account of the life and deeds of the great Macedonian conqueror as it was current in Greek and Latin versions of the early Middle Ages, such as the Greek romance of pseudo-Callisthenes, dating from the third century A.D., the Latin translation of Julius Valerius, the epitome thereof, and especially the free Latin version made by the Neapolitan archpresbyter Leo in the tenth century, known as the \\"Historia de preliis\\". A comparison of Lamprecht's opening lines with the fragment preserved of the French original shows that he followed his source with tolerable fidelity, adding, however, occasional moralizing comments or remarks of a learned nature. Altogether there are 7302 verses in short rhymed couplets, the rhyme being very imperfect. Besides Alb√©ric's poem, which, as far as we know it, is based on Valerius, Lamprecht used also the \\"Historia de preliis\\" and an \\"Iter ad paradisum\\", especially in the narration of the marvels seen by Alexander in the Far East, and in the account of the hero's journey to Paradise. There admittance is refused him, and he is made to realize the emptiness of earthly glory. Thus the close of the poem is distinctly moralizing in tone; the career of the great conqueror is but an illustration of the dictum concerning the vanity of earthly things. The poem seems to have been written in Middle Rhenish territory about 1130, at a time, therefore, when the crusades had brought the East nearer to the Western world, and when stories of its marvels were sure to find an eager audience. Manuscripts There are three manuscripts of Lamprecht's poem extant, one from Vorau which is not quite complete, one from Strasburg dating from 1187, which is about five times as extensive as the preceding, and lastly a version interpolated in the manuscript of a Basle chronicle. The relationship of the manuscripts to one another is in doubt. The Vorau manuscript is generally regarded as the oldest and most authentic; that of Strasburg as an amplified recension. The Basle manuscript is certainly late and inferior in value to the other two. Editions The \\"Alexanderlied\\" with German translation was first edited by Heinrich Weismann (2 vols., Frankfurt, 1850); the best edition is by Karl Kinzel in \\"Germanistische Handbibliothek\\", ed. Zacher, VI (Halle, 1884). The Vorau manuscript was edited by Joseph Diemer in \\"Deutsche Gedichte des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts\\" (Vienna, 1849), the Strasburg manuscript by Hans Ferdinand Massmann in \\"Deutsche Gedichte des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts\\" (Quedlinburg, 1837), and the Basle manuscript by Richard Maria Werner (Stuttgart, 1882) in \\"Bibliothek des Literarischen Vereins in Stuttgart\\", CLIV.

Found in the body of the maxilla, this sinus has three recesses: an alveolar recess pointed inferiorly, bounded by the alveolar process of the maxilla; a zygomatic recess pointed laterally, bounded by the zygomatic bone; and an infraorbital recess pointed superiorly, bounded by the inferior orbital surface of the maxilla. The medial wall is composed primarily of cartilage. The ostia for drainage are located high on the medial wall and open into the semilunar hiatus of the lateral nasal cavity; because of the position of the ostia, gravity cannot drain the maxillary sinus contents when the head is erect (see pathology). The ostium of the maxillary sinus is high up on the medial wall and on average is 2.4 mm in diameter; with a mean volume of about 10 ml. The sinus is lined with mucoperiosteum, with cilia that beat toward the ostia. This membranous lining is also referred to as the Schneiderian membrane, which is histologically a bilaminar membrane with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells on the internal (or cavernous) side and periosteum on the osseous side. The size of the sinuses varies in different skulls, and even on the two sides of the same skull.Bell, G.W., et al. Maxillary sinus disease: diagnosis and treatment, British Dental Journal 210, 113 - 118 (2011) at http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v210/n3/full/sj.bdj.2011.47.html The infraorbital canal usually projects into the cavity as a well-marked ridge extending from the roof to the anterior wall; additional ridges are sometimes seen in the posterior wall of the cavity and are caused by the alveolar canals. The mucous membranes receive their postganglionic parasympathetic nerve innervation for mucous secretion originating from the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). The superior alveolar (anterior, middle, and posterior) nerves, branches of the maxillary nerve provide sensory innervation. =Walls= The nasal wall of the maxillary sinus, or base, presents, in the disarticulated bone, a large, irregular aperture, communicating with the nasal cavity. In the articulated skull this aperture is much reduced in size by the following bones: * the uncinate process of the ethmoid above, * the ethmoidal process of the inferior nasal concha below, * the vertical part of the palatine behind, * and a small part of the lacrimal above and in front. The sinus communicates through an opening into the semilunar hiatus on the lateral nasal wall. On the posterior wall are the alveolar canals, transmitting the posterior superior alveolar vessels and nerves to the molar teeth. upper jaw. This dental x-ray film shows how, in the absence of the second premolar and first molar, the sinus became pneumatized and expanded towards the crest of the alveolar process (location at which the bone meets the gum tissue). The floor is formed by the alveolar process, and, if the sinus is of an average size, is on a level with the floor of the nose; if the sinus is large it reaches below this level. Projecting into the floor of the antrum are several conical processes, corresponding to the roots of the first and second maxillary molar teeth; in some cases the floor can be perforated by the apices of the teeth. The roof is formed by floor of the orbit. It is traversed by infraorbital nerves and vessels. =Development= It is the first sinus to appear as a shallow groove. At birth it measures about 7*4*4mm. It continues to develops throughout childhood at an annual rate of 2mm vertically and 3mm anteroposteriorly. It reaches its final size in the seventeenth to eighteenth year of life. Clinical significance =Maxillary sinusitis= 130px Maxillary sinusitis is inflammation of the maxillary sinuses. The symptoms of sinusitis are headache, usually near the involved sinus, and foul-smelling nasal or pharyngeal discharge, possibly with some systemic signs of infection such as fever and weakness. The skin over the involved sinus can be tender, hot, and even reddened due to the inflammatory process in the area. On radiographs, there is opacification (or cloudiness) of the usually translucent sinus due to retained mucus.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 67 Maxillary sinusitis is common due to the close anatomic relation of the frontal sinus, anterior ethmoidal sinus and the maxillary teeth, allowing for easy spread of infection. Differential diagnosis of dental problems needs to be done due to the close proximity to the teeth since the pain from sinusitis can seem to be dentally related. Furthermore, the drainage orifice lies near the roof of the sinus, and so the maxillary sinus does not drain well, and infection develops more easily. The maxillary sinus may drain into the mouth via an abnormal opening, an oroantral fistula, a particular risk after tooth extraction.  Oro-antral communication (OAC)  An OAC is an abnormal physical communication between the maxillary sinus and the mouth. This opening is only present when the structures, that normally separates the mouth and sinus into 2 separate compartments, are lost. There are many causes of an OAC. The most common reason is following extraction of a posterior maxillary (upper) premolar or molar tooth. Other causes include trauma, pathology (e.g. tumours or cysts), infection or iatrogenic damage during surgery. Iatrogenic damage during dental treatment accounts for nearly half of the incidence of dental- related maxillary sinusitis. There is always a thin layer of mucous membrane (Schneiderian membrane) and usually bone between the roots of the upper back teeth and the floor of the maxillary sinus. However, the bone can vary in thickness in different individuals, ranging from complete absence to 12mm thick. Therefore, in certain individuals the membrane +/- the bony floor of the sinus can be perforated easily, creating an opening into the mouth when a tooth is extracted. An OAC that is smaller than 2mm can heal spontaneously i.e. closure of the opening. Those that are larger than 2mm have a higher chance of developing into oro-antral fistula (OAF). The passage is only defined as an OAF if it is persistent and lined by epithelium. Epithelialisation happens when an OAC persist for at least 2‚Äì3 days and oral epithelial cells proliferate to linethe defect. Large defects (more than 2mm) should be surgically closed as soon as possible to avoid accumulation of food and saliva which could contaminate the maxillary sinus, leading to infection (sinusitis). Various surgical techniques can be employed to manage an OAF but the most common involves pulling and stitching some soft tissue from the gum to cover the opening (i.e. soft tissue flap). Sinusitis treatment Traditionally the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis is usually prescription of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic resistant to beta- lactamase, administered for 10 days. Recent studies have found that the cause of chronic sinus infections lies in the nasal mucus, not in the nasal and sinus tissue targeted by standard treatment. This suggests a beneficial effect in treatments that target primarily the underlying and presumably damage- inflicting nasal and sinus membrane inflammation, instead of the secondary bacterial infection that has been the primary target of past treatments for the disease. Also, surgical procedures with chronic sinus infections are now changing with the direct removal of the mucus, which is loaded with toxins from the inflammatory cells, rather than the inflamed tissue during surgery. Leaving the mucus behind might predispose early recurrence of the chronic sinus infection.

It may also block the nasolacrimal duct. Spread of the tumor into the orbit causes proptosis.

In this episode, Angel acts as a bodyguard to a fading actress named Rebecca. When she discovers Angel is a vampire, she begs him to make her eternally young as well - after first slipping him a drug to make him more agreeable to her request. However, the drug-induced euphoria reverts Angel to evil Angelus, and he almost kills Rebecca before Wesley and Cordelia arrive to knock him unconscious. Plot While attending a play with Cordelia as one of the stars, Angel and Wesley ‚Äì trapped in the audience ‚Äì are subjected to Cordelia's minimal acting talent. While leaving the play, they spot a famous actress, Rebecca Lowell, crossing the street. Angel rushes to save her from a car that purposely tries to run her over. Oliver, a producer that represents Rebecca, offers to pay Angel, but he doesn't want a reward. The papers report on the rescue, but Angel pretends not to care when he is not mentioned. Rebecca shows up at the office the next day, and asks for his help with a stalker fan. Her career is on the rocks, and she'd feel safer if Angel would take care of this case. Cordelia is upset that Angel refused to take the case, and begs Angel to give it a chance so that she can have a jump-start into the life of fame. After a party, Rebecca's stalker shows up on her property, but Angel breaks through a window ‚Äì having been invited earlier by Rebecca to \\"drop by any time\\" ‚Äì and fights the masked stalker. Rebecca looks at a mirror and realizes Angel doesn't have a reflection; correctly guessing he is a vampire, she is intrigued rather than scared. That night, Angel attends a premiere with Rebecca, standing as her bodyguard. As they leave, an attacker pulls a gun on them, and Angel fights him off. Rebecca recognizes the attacker as a stunt man and realizes that Oliver set up the stalker for publicity, as her career is in danger as she grows older. She realizes that she won't be able to stay young forever, but Angel's immortality suddenly gives her another option. After discovering the bullets were blanks, Wesley and Angel conclude that it wasn't a real attack. Rebecca and Cordelia go shopping together, and Cordelia helps Rebecca pick out a bottle of champagne for Angel. That night, while sipping champagne, Rebecca \\"accidentally\\" spills some on Angel and he has to go change his shirt. She slips a drug, later revealed to be \\"doximal\\", a euphoric, into his drink and they toast and drink when he returns. Cordelia confesses to Wesley that she told Rebecca all about Angel and how one could become a vampire by him. As the drug takes effect, Rebecca tries to convince Angel to make her a vampire. Angel says she doesn't realize what she's asking of him, and in a sudden burst of rage, he sprays blood into her mouth so she can taste what she's getting into. Angel, realizing something is wrong, asks Rebecca what she has done. She confesses that she slipped a happy pill into his drink hoping that it would make Angel relax. Instead, the pill has given him the feeling of \\"perfect happiness.\\" No longer Angel, Angelus attacks Rebecca, but she manages to escape through the elevator. Upstairs, she runs into Cordelia and Wesley and reveals to them what she has done. Meanwhile, Angelus goes outside and cuts the power and phones. In the office, Angelus confronts Rebecca and his two employees. He mocks Wesley for being inadequate, then tells Cordelia how bad she was in the play. She threatens him with water, trying to convince him that it's holy water. The water temporarily stuns him when it hits him, allowing Wesley to knock him down into the elevator shaft. Angel wakes up, chained to his bed, feeling horrible about the things he said. Cordelia reluctantly forgives him, but leaves Angel chained to the bed. Trivia Oliver Simon, Rebecca's manager, was seen in a brief and uncredited appearance in the series pilot \\"City Of\\" at Margo's party as the manager who gives Angel his card and disclaims any effort at a come-on. Tamara Gorski appeared in an episode of the Canadian vampire detective series Forever Knight, playing another young woman who wishes to be immortal. Production details =Writing= Originally, Angel was envisioned as being an anthology, with the client of the week providing the emotional center for each episode. However, as the first season progressed, the writers began to concentrate on the emotional interplay between the main characters instead. As producer Tim Minear explains, \\"You can have an interesting plot and an interesting client, but it's difficult to create sympathy for someone you're introducing for one episode.\\" This episode at first presents events from the guest character's point of view, but \\"if you look at how the episode ended up,\\" Minear says, \\"it's really about our core people, and by the end of the episode the client's gone. There's not even a wrap up scene at the end with the actress. It's all about Angel being chained to the bed and Cordelia not untying him.\\" In the first versions of the script, the emotional focus remained on Rebecca for the entire episode, until creator Joss Whedon decided to add the element of Angel going bad. \\"If that episode had gone before the cameras earlier in the rotation, I think you would have probably seen a different ending, with more emphasis placed on the actress and her problem than on Angel,\\" Minear says. This episode demonstrates that the \\"moment of perfect happiness\\" that triggers Angel's curse does not have to be sexual. As Wesley points out, Angel became Angelus in the episode \\"Surprise\\" not because he had sex, but because he was with Buffy. \\"It is a very fine line that he walks,\\" Minear says. \\"And if he goes a little bit too far, there is the danger that he will destroy the very people he's connecting with.\\" =Arc significance= This marks the first reappearance of Angelus in the present time since the Buffy episode \\"Becoming, Part Two\\". This episode stirs up the feeling among Cordelia and Wesley that Angel's soul is a very fragile thing and he could turn on them at any time. This aspect of mistrust plays heavily in season 2. =Cultural references= * A Doll's House: The play in which Cordelia stars at the beginning of this episode is by Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen. Cordelia is playing Nora Helmer, the female lead. The scene shown is from the first act. * Dracula: At one point, Rebecca says, \\"Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman... they're vampires\\", to which Angel replies, \\"I thought Frank Langella was the only performance I believed...\\" They refer to three actors who have played Dracula, Lugosi in Dracula in 1931, Langella in 1979's Dracula and Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992. Dracula also appears as an enemy in Buffy vs. Dracula (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) in Season 5. Reception and reviews Minear says, \\"I know there was a lot of criticism on the Internet about the way he went bad, and did he really go bad?\\" However, he feels the drug was a good plot device to bring Angelus into the series \\"so that he could interact with our characters without doing some big ‚ÄòAngel has turned evil‚Äô arc. You sort of get to have your cake and eat it too in that episode.\\" He adds, \\"I saw some criticism about Cordelia reacting too Cordelia-like in the first half of the episode with her star-struckness. But that would be her.\\" References External links * * Category:Angel (season 1) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes ","title":"Eternity (Angel)"},{"id":"2357606","text":"The year 1966 in art involved some significant events and new works.

Life and career Marlowe was born as Sarah Frances Frost at Caldbeck, Cumberland, England, to clogger and shoemaker John Frost and Sarah (Strong) Hodgson.Caldbeck Characters 1995 p. 25; When she was four her family emigrated to the United States.

He changed his name to Brough and after first settling in Kansas he moved his family east to Portsmouth, Ohio and then Cincinnati. =Early career= Marlowe obtained the nickname of \\"Fanny\\" and in her early teens began her career in the chorus of a juvenile opera company. While touring with the company for nearly a year performing Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore (1879), under the direction of Colonel Robert E.J. Miles (manager of the Cincinnati Opera House) she was given the part of Sir Joseph Porter. She later played in W. S. Gilbert's Pygmalion and Galatea. Her training and initial success was due primarily to Miles's sister-in-law Ada Dow. Still in Cincinnati, Fanny played her first Shakespearean roles as Balthazar in Romeo and Juliet and as Maria in Twelfth Night she was billed as Fanny Brough. Soon after Ada Dow took Fanny to New York where for several years she received voice training by Parsons Price. Finished with the voice training she changed her name to Julia Marlowe. As an unknown, Marlowe was, at first, unable to get a Shakesperean role, but she was determined. Colonel Miles, the new manager of the New York Bijou Opera House, gave her the opportunity to play for two weeks on tour in New England, starting in New London, Connecticut. This gave Marlowe the repertoire she needed. On 20 October 1887, her mother hired the Bijou for a matinee of Ingomar, the Barbarian (Maria Lovell's adaptation of Friedrich Halm's Der Sohn der Wildnis), in which Marlowe received acclaim which served as a stepping stone to Broadway.When Knighthood Was in Flower In early 1891, Marlowe came down with a severe case of typhoid fever while on tour in Philadelphia. The owner of the Philadelphia Times newspaper and his wife took Julia in and oversaw her return to health.UNCG Digital Collections Hansen Performing Arts Collection - Correspondence from Julia Marlowe; accessed September 26, 2015. At one point her face became so swollen that doctors considered lancing her face to release the toxins, but the good judgment of one doctor prevailed and a different treatment was arrived at which would fight the toxins and save her face for her acting career. Had this measure not been taken, she would never have been performing on Broadway by 1895 and would never have established herself as the leading American actress of Shakespeare in her day alongside actor E. H. Sothern.UNCG Digital Collections Hansen Performing Arts Collection - Cigar Box Label; accessed She made her Broadway debut in 1895 and went on to appear in more than seventy Broadway productions. With the money from her first Broadway success, she bought the townhouse known as River Mansion at 337 Riverside Drive.No. 337: The Shakespearean ‚Äî NY Times Her first husband was Broadway actor Robert Taber. Their marriage lasted from 1894 to 1900 and produced no children. Taber and Marlowe were married in 1894. According to many who knew her, Marlowe sacrificed her own self-interests many times in order to promote Taber's career. Despite this, however, professional jealousy ended their marriage in 1900. In a letter dated April 2nd, 1895 from Taber he writes \\"I herewith return your play. Mrs. Taber is grateful for your kindness in submitting it and notwithstanding its interest - She finds it unsuited for her present use. Very truly yours, Robert Taber\\". Taber was touring in England at the time of their divorce.UNCG Digital Collections Hansen Performing Arts Collection - Postcard of Robert Taber In 1904, Marlowe starred as Mary Tudor in Paul Kester's adaptation of When Knighthood Was in Flower. This was an enormous success, and made Marlowe financially independent. Other hits for Marlowe followed including Charlotte Oliver in the adaptation by Kester and Middleton of George Washington Cable's The Cavalier, and Ingomar, both in 1903. Of her performance in the latter, The New York Sun wrote, \\"There is not a woman player in America or in England that is ‚Äì attractively considered ‚Äì fit to unlace her shoe\\".Morley, Sheridan. The Great Stage Stars, pp. 263‚Äì65, Angus & Robertson, London, 1986; =Sothern and later years= Sothern and Marlowe as Romeo and Juliet 1904 In 1904, she began an extremely successful partnership with actor E. H. Sothern, beginning with their appearances in the title roles in Romeo and Juliet, Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, and the leads in Hamlet. They toured all over the U.S. in these plays, adding The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice and Twelfth Night to their repertoire in 1905. Unhappy with their compensation from their manager, Charles Frohman, they continued under the management of the Shubert Brothers, from then on receiving a percentage of the profits. In 1906, together with Sothern, she played the title character in Percy MacKaye's Jeanne d'Arc, Salome in Sudermann's John the Baptist and Rautendelein in The Sunken Bell, receiving favorable reviews. Portia in an early 20th century performance of The Merchant of Venice After another season in New York and then on tour, Sothern, Marlowe and their company crossed the Atlantic to play in London. They were unable to attract audiences in England, however, and returned to America after a season. Back in the U.S., they presented Shakespeare at affordable prices at the Academy of Music in New York, allowing audiences who had not previously been able to afford their productions to see them. Marlowe and Sothern dissolved their company and formed separate companies for a time. She played in J. B. Fagan's Gloria, in Romeo and Juliet and in As You Like It. In 1908, she played Yvette in Mary Johnston's verse play The Goddess of Reason. At the end of 1909, Sothern and Marlowe reunited in Antony and Cleopatra. In 1910, they toured in Macbeth, receiving enthusiastic notices and bringing the production to New York where it was a hit. They continued to tour their Shakespearean repertoire, playing special performances of the plays for schoolchildren. Marlowe and Sothern married in 1911. The couple made eleven phonograph recordings for the Victor company in 1920‚Äì1921. These recordings are presumably the only recorded evidence of Marlowe's voice today. After more touring with Sothern in Shakespeare, the two brought their production of The Merchant of Venice to New York in 1921. Soon afterwards, Marlowe's health was failing, and she retired in 1924. After Sothern's death in 1933, Marlowe became somewhat of a recluse. She occasionally visited close friends like ailing playwright Edward Sheldon. In 1923, she received an honorary doctorate from George Washington University, and another in 1943 from Columbia University. Feminism Marlowe was highly engaged as a feminist. She fought for women's right to vote.Suffrage Gains Pair of Noted Women Converts, World New York, 19-10-1909, URL: https://www.loc.gov/item/rbcmiller003752/; files in: Public Library, https://www.loc.gov/search/?in=&q;=Marlowe+Julia+suffragist&new;=true&st;= (4-26-2018).

He worked first on stage in Britain, performing various works by Shakespeare, then in America on Broadway and in Hollywood, and eventually spent the remainder of his life appearing in Italian cinema. He is perhaps best known for his starring role in 1954's historical epic The Egyptian. By taking over important roles exited by Mario Lanza and Marlon Brando, Purdom was known by the mid-1950s as \\"The Replacement Star\\". Between the 1970s and 1990s, he was a regular in European genre cinema, working with directors like Juan Piquer Sim√≥n, Joe D'Amato, Sergio Martino, Ruggero Deodato His daughter Lilan Purdom became a journalist for French TV Channel TF1. She is the author of the book Hollywood Garage, which relates the tumultuous career of her father. The book is published in English and in French. Early life Purdom was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England and educated at St. Augustine's Abbey School, then by the Jesuits at St. Ignatius Grammar School and Welwyn Garden City Grammar School. Career He began his acting career in 1946 by joining the Northampton Repertory Company, appearing in productions that included Romeo and Juliet and Moli√®re's The Imaginary Invalid. After two years of military service where he joined the Army's Central Pool of Artists, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon for two seasons. Laurence Olivier saw Purdom and offered him a chance to tour in the U.S. =USA= In 1951‚Äì1952, Purdom appeared in small roles with the Laurence Olivier/Vivien Leigh company on Broadway in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. His good looks brought him to the attention of Hollywood. Warner Bros. wanted to test him and offered him a $600 advance to come to Hollywood. He did a screen test directed by Michael Curtiz from a scene from Force of Arms but Warners were not interested. Because Purdom had left his play, he did not have the fare to return to Britain, so he decided to stay in Hollywood. Universal tested him for the part of the leading girl's brother in The Mississippi Gambler but decided he was too British. 20th Century Fox tested him for a role in My Cousin Rachel. MGM offered him a small role in Rhapsody, which he turned down to work at Warner Bros., but Warners lost interest in him. \\"I was so broke,\\" Purdom recalled, \\"that I couldn't afford to pay the doctor's bill when my daughter was born. I had no money for bus fare. I had to walk from studio to studio looking for a job. Once we were evicted for not paying the rent.\\" =MGM= He managed to get a small part in Julius Caesar at MGM. George Cukor recommended him to Charles Brackett for the small role of Charles Lightoller in Titanic (1953). This brought Purdom to the attention of executives at MGM who signed him to a long-term contract. =The Student Prince= Mario Lanza was fired from the lead role in a new version of The Student Prince (1954). Lilian Burns suggested Purdom for the part, and he did a successful test directed by George Sidney. He was cast opposite Ann Blyth. The film was directed by Richard Thorpe. Purdom lip-synched to Lanza's singing voice. =The Egyptian= Advance word on The Student Prince was promising, and when 20th Century Fox needed an actor at the last minute to replace Marlon Brando as the title character in The Egyptian, its most lavish production of 1954, Purdom was cast over John Derek, John Cassavetes and Cameron Mitchell. MGM's head of production Dore Schary announced the studio would build up Purdom as a star. He was cast in three films: another MGM musical, Athena; the title role in the biblical epic The Prodigal, MGM's most lavish production of 1955, opposite Lana Turner; and the swashbuckler The King's Thief (1955), in a role originally meant for Stewart Granger. There was also some talk he would appear in the remake of Ben Hur. The Student Prince was released and became a hit. Purdom was called \\"the most promising new star in Hollywood\\". Hedda Hopper called Purdom \\"the most surprising and notable figure this year in Hollywood...a fine actor in the great romantic tradition.\\" =Leaving MGM= Schary later wrote in his memoirs that \\"Lanza's recordings were the prime ingredient for the picture's success, and that success went to Purdom's head. He believed he was responsible for the happy result. He asked for a new contract. We denied it. He asked for a release. We granted it.\\" Another contributing factor may have been that while The Student Prince had been a hit, The Egyptian was a box-office disappointment. Athena, The Prodigal and The King's Thief were all flops. There was more bad publicity when he had an affair with Linda Christian (when she was married to Tyrone Power) leading to him divorcing his first wife. The split was bitter and public, and his wife later sued him for child support. Purdom argued for a reduction in child support because he no longer had his MGM contract worth $40,000 per year. He told the court he had renegotiated it in order to seek more money by freelancing and that he was in debt for $11,500. He said MGM had an option on his services for three films over three years. \\"It is my greatest desire to get back in front of the camera at the present time,\\" he said. He was announced for Loser Takes All (1956) but did not appear in the final film. For Allied Artists, Purdom made Strange Intruder (1956) with Ida Lupino. In 1957, he married Alicia Darr, who later got in a brawl with Christian. He continued to be sued for debts by his ex-wife and his lawyers. Purdom returned to Broadway, appearing in Child of Fortune, an adaptation of Henry James's The Wings of the Dove, for Jed Harris. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times stated Purdom \\"plays the part of the faithless suitor like a cultivated gentleman but his style is heavy.\\" The play did not enjoy a long run.Child of Fortune at IBDB He went into television, starring as Marco del Monte in Sword of Freedom (1958) (also known as Marco the Magnificent), a swashbuckler made for ITC Entertainment in Italy. =Europe= Purdom stayed in Italy, where the film industry was booming. His films included Herod the Great (1959), The Cossacks (1960), The Loves of Salammbo (1960), Suleiman the Conqueror (1961) and Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile (1961). He also occasionally worked in England on films such as Malaga (1960) and The Comedy Man (1964). In 1962, he said \\"I couldn't stand Hollywood. The people, their status, symbols and public image were too much. I walked out. Perhaps I should have been more patient.\\" Hedda Hopper wrote in response to this: \\"the truth is he did his best to become a star here, but he didn't make the grade - even with Mario Lanza's voice; but he did walk out on his wife and family and start gallivanting around with Linda Christian. I'll bet he'll come hopping back if anyone crooked a finger.\\" He eventually married Christian in 1962, but they divorced the following year. He continued to work extensively in Italian B-films, on television and as a voice dubbing actor for many years (recording dialogue translated from Italian into English for sales of Italian films in English- speaking countries). He also had roles in TV movies and miniseries, such as Sophia Loren: Her Own Story (as Vittorio De Sica) and The Winds of War. In 1984, he directed Don't Open till Christmas. He was also very active as a music recording engineer, including work on the soundtracks of films such as The Bible: In the Beginning... as well as many classical concerts in Florence and Vienna. He is credited for devising a technique transferring monaural sound to stereo. He narrated a popular short documentary on the life of Padre Pio. He also narrated the Christian documentary 7 Signs of Christ's Return. Seven Signs of Christ's Return (1997). IMDB.com Purdom died from heart failure on 1 January 2009 in Rome. Personal life Purdom with Linda Christian in 1962 Purdom was married four times and divorced three times. His first three wives, all divorced, were: * Anita (Tita) Philips (or Phillips), the mother of his children, Lilan (b 11 October 1952) and Marina Ann (b 8 July 1954); married 1951, divorced 1956. * Alicia Darr (m 1957) of Polish extraction. * actress Linda Christian in 1962 (divorced 1963), former wife of Tyrone Power In 2000, he married the photographer Vivienne Purdom.

Still reeling from Doyle's death just days ago, Angel and Cordelia encounter an old friend from Sunnydale, Buffy‚Äôs former Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, now a leather-clad, rogue, demon hunter. Meanwhile, Cordelia discovers that Doyle has passed on his gift of visions from The Powers That Be, which subject her to the same unbearable headaches that afflicted Doyle. When one of Angel‚Äôs clients, a black-marketeer demon named Barney, learns of Cordelia‚Äôs new powers, he abducts her and auctions off her \\"seer's eyes\\" to a group of wealthy demons and humans, including a representative from Wolfram & Hart. Wesley assists Angel in Cordy's rescue and effectively‚Äîif unofficially‚Äîjoins the AI team. Plot Angel goes to the Oracles to ask for Doyle's life back, but they will not help him, even when he protests that Doyle, aside from being his friend, was also his only link to The Powers That Be. Cryptically, the Oracles tell Angel that when one door closes, another door opens, before imperiously waving him out of their realm. Meanwhile, in the real world, an unprepossessing demon runs frantically down an alley in broad daylight, trying to evade the pursuit of a mysterious, black-clad motorcycle rider. At Angel Investigations, Cordelia despondently seeks something tangible to keep in memory of Doyle. Angel tries to be understanding, but Cordy shies away from further discussion of her feelings, until her watch beeps a reminder that she is scheduled for an audition. When she opens the door to leave, the demon being chased by the motorcyclist is just coming in to ask Angel for help. Sending Cordelia on her way, Angel tries to ascertain whether he can help this demon, whose name is Barney, as well as whether he wants to. Proclaiming himself an empath demon, Barney admits he uses his ability to read people's emotions to get the edge at cards, or at the fights. Angel bluntly identifies Barney as a cheat and wonders whether the guy on the motorcycle might have good reason to be after him. Barney protests that, even though he's not perfect, he's not \\"evil\\" and can't imagine why this guy has tracked him across state after state. At her audition, Cordelia breaks down sobbing in the middle of her reading and then, when the three producers generously give her another try, suffers her first vision. The man on the motorcycle continues to track the demon he's after, dismounting to examine more closely a viscous yellow fluid he finds on the corner of a building. Returning from her audition, Cordelia silently zeros in on an alert but essentially unprepared Angel, and kisses him thoroughly. Realizing that Doyle's kiss was the mechanism for passing his visions to her, Cordelia embarks on a kissing spree to rid herself of his unwanted \\"gift,\\" unaware or uncaring that if she succeeds she'll foist the visions off on a truly hapless soul. After Cordelia amazes Angel and disgusts herself by kissing even (amazed) Barney, Angel leaves the empath demon under her care, with instructions to also try to sketch what she saw in her vision. As he checks out Barney's decidedly low-rent motel room, Angel is ambushed by the motorcycle man, revealed in the flickering light of the dark corridor to be armed with a crossbow. After shoving Angel further into the room and leveling his crossbow at the vampire's chest, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce moves far enough into the light to be recognized. Little surprised and certainly unthreatened, Angel effortlessly disarms Wesley, learning that the former Watcher quit the Council and now considers himself a rogue demon hunter. As Angel and Wesley compare notes on their overlapping cases, an enormous demon, oozing viscous yellow fluid, drops on them with a roar. Slinging Wesley against the wall with ease, the demon lands a few good ones on Angel, until Wesley shoots it with the crossbow he retrieves from the floor. To their surprise, the demon screams and crashes out the second story window to run away, limping and moaning, as fast as possible down the empty street. Meanwhile, at Angel's apartment, Cordelia tries to sketch the \\"ugly, gray, blobby thing\\" she saw in her vision. At loose ends, Barney attempts to engage Cordelia in conversation by offering sympathy for her grief, and immediately finds himself the target of her anger and suspicion. When Barney assures her he didn't mean to intrude, it is Cordelia who apologizes for her rudeness and, to make amends, opens up a little about Doyle. Just then, Angel comes downstairs, bringing the black-clad motorcycle rider with him. Barney runs and hides and Angel follows to reassure his timid client. Checking to see that Angel is out of sight, Cordelia slides into silent stalker mode, accosts Wesley, and kisses him. Not dumbfounded for long, Wesley pulls his old Sunnydale friend (whom he recognized immediately) into a tight clinch and (unlike Angel) kisses her back. Cordelia's focus is so intent that she only recognizes Wesley after exclaiming with disgust and disappointment that the visions are still with her. As Angel and Barney reenter the room, Wesley snaps back on task and disappears in the direction of Angel's library, only to reappear moments later having identified their opponent as a Kungai, a demon of Asian origin. The \\"rogue demon hunter\\" claims that continuing to track the Kungai is his job, or their job, if Angel insists, but Angel, still raw from losing his partner, orders Wesley to stay behind. Bribing the belligerent desk clerk (who seems to recognize Angel) to let him in back at the Lotus Spa (featuring Korean mineral baths), Angel finds the Kungai demon, but it is dying because the Tak horn on its forehead has been, literally, ripped off. Angel speaks Korean, apparently, but can't understand what the Kungai so urgently wants him to know. Back at Angel's apartment, Cordelia continues to sketch the object from her vision and, apparently feeling more herself, begins to complain about Doyle's \\"gift.\\" With surprising insight, Barney gently chastens Cordelia, guessing that Doyle must have honored her with both his trust and his most valuable possession. While Cordelia makes coffee, Barney makes a call to his associate, Hank, and, dropping the timid, sensitive act, reveals that it is he who stole the horn from the Kungai demon. But, Barney tells Hank, he now has a line on something even more interesting--Cordelia's clairvoyant powers. Wesley shows up at the spa and helps Angel by translating the Kungai's last words, which identify Barney as his murderer. At Angel's place, Barney permanently dispenses with his mild-mannered persona and starts to terrorize Cordelia. Physically overmatched by Barney's demon strength, Cordelia is unable to prevent him from tying her wrists behind her. Still, she fights back by pretending to get a vision and, in the demon's moment of distraction, kicks him squarely between the legs. Originally wishing to empathically savor Cordelia's fear, Barney has worked her into such a frenzied state that she now refuses to leave quietly. With mild regret for damaging merchandise (and with maybe a tinge of vengefulness), Barney knocks Cordelia unconscious with a punch to the jaw and takes her from the building. Returning to the empty apartment, Angel and Wesley both feel responsible for Cordelia's fate. As Angel hunts for clues, Wesley collapses in despair over losing yet another young woman from his care. \\"I'm a fraud,\\" he tells Angel. \\"The Council was right to sack me.\\" Angel, initially annoyed, now listens with more patience, even as he continues to comb the place for evidence. When Angel finds the crumpled drawing Cordelia made from her vision, he rotates the paper ninety degrees and recognizes it as the gray, blobby sculpture, \\"Maiden with Urn,\\" by an artist with whom he's familiar. Finally getting a clue, he and Wesley both snap into research mode. Angel queries the web and finds that the sculpture is currently owned by a hotel chain with many establishments in the L.A. area. Wesley, having looked up the one Kungai phrase he hadn't been able to translate, finally figures out that \\"caller sale\\" means \\"auction.\\" This gives the guys the last piece of the puzzle and, taking only moments to arm themselves, they race to Cordy's rescue. Meanwhile, Cordelia wakes, bound and gagged, in a strange room where the only familiar object is the ugly, gray blobby thing from her vision--which she is looking at sideways because she's lying on her side on a settee. As she tries to get her bearings, Cordelia notices a long cloth-draped table covered with various grisly body parts and organs, dominated by a still-beating heart in a pedestaled bell jar. Hearing Barney talking with someone and approaching from the other room, she hastily closes her eyes and lays her head back down. To her consternation, they seem to be discussing whether to remove her eyes before or after the auction, as Barney's wild-eyed associate, Hank, obsessively clicks the extractor device over and over. The auction begins. The item for sale immediately before Cordelia's lot number comes up is the Tak horn from the hapless Kungai. Hank brings Cordelia to the podium, where she stands aghast while Barney opens the bidding for her lovely seer's eyes at $2,000. While Angel and Wesley zero in on her location, Cordelia buys time by inciting a bidding war between two patrons. When the contest proves lethal for one bidder and the matter seems settled at a substantial $20,000 (which has Barney practically hopping with glee), the representative from Wolfram & Hart suddenly bids $30,000. Barney nearly passes out, but manages to bang his gavel and close the deal before anything can interfere with such an unexpected windfall. Cordelia is now the evil law firm's property, and Angel and Wesley are nowhere to be seen. The auction is over. Cordelia is in the back room listening to Barney negotiate with Mac, the lawyer from Wolfram and Hart, about the additional fee for removing her eyes, and to Hank still clacking the four-pronged extractor. To Cordelia's horror, Mac agrees to the extra grand and Barney, taking the extractor away from the seriously disappointed Hank, holds the seer down and starts to do the job himself. At that moment, a body comes flying through the curtained doorway and Angel and Wesley, who have worked their way from the front of the hotel to back here behind the Tulip Room, follow immediately after. Barney raps out, \\"Hank? Stakes!\\" and the fight is on. Mac, having already made a strategic exit, uses her cell phone to give a situation report as, behind her, Angel wades in, shouting to Wesley to get Cordelia. The hilariously bumbling Wes manages to ungag her, but must use the serrated curve of the Tak horn that got knocked to the floor nearby to cut her bonds--because he can't get at the knife he earlier taped so securely to his leg. Just as Wes and Cordy head for the nearest exit, Barney blocks their path, the homicidal glint in his eyes matched by the righteous fury in Wesley's. In the ensuing struggle, Barney quickly gets the upper hand and starts to throttle the demon hunter who tracked him so relentlessly. With a shout, Cordelia grabs the Tak horn and stabs the murderous empath demon in the back. They watch in horrified fascination as the Tak horn's power drains his life force and his body shrivels and blackens and sinks away. Angel dispatches the last of his foes and, when an overjoyed Cordelia flings her arms around him, acknowledges Wesley's invaluable assistance. Back at Angel's apartment, Cordelia sits at the kitchen table and frames her ugly, gray, blobby drawing as a memento for saving her life, and as a reminder that something of Doyle's will always be with them. Moved, Angel silently turns back to the stove and continues to scramble eggs, while Wesley finishes packing up his things. As Wesley makes his farewells, he wistfully draws out his departure to give the other two ample opportunity to invite him to stay. When Angel finally relents and says, \\"breakfast?\\", Wesley accepts with alacrity and the three friends enjoy each other's company for this moment of peace, warmth, and safety. Writing =Arc significance= * Glenn Quinn and Doyle appear for the last time in the main titles. Doyle's next appearance is in \\"Birthday\\", where Skip shows Cordelia an image of Doyle when explaining the visions. His last appearance is in \\"You're Welcome\\", where Angel and Cordy review the tape of the commercial Doyle helped with in \\"Hero\\". * Cordelia receives her first vision from The Powers That Be. When she tries to follow through with her avowal to Doyle in \\"Lonely Hearts\\" to \\"give it back,\\" she discovers that there's some trick besides just kissing to passing \\"the gift\\" along. Initially an unwilling recipient, Cordelia actively chooses to keep the visions in \\"Birthday\\". * This is the first time Wesley is seen on Angel. From this time onwards, he appears in every episode except \\"Destiny\\", in season five. He eventually grows out of his puppyish clumsiness, and Angel comes to rely on him more and more. * This is the first time Angel Investigations uses the tag-line 'Help the Helpless' (said by Barney, their demonic client). Before this the line had always been 'Help the Hopeless', a line which is used a few more times before the 'helpless' version becomes more common at the end of Season One and is used completely by Season Two. =Continuity= * Wesley's moment of self- realization (and self-loathing) ignites Angel's compassion.

Plot summary David, friend of a caretaker named Homer, is an elderly man who is spending his later years hanging out at the local gas station in a small town. Homer narrates a tale about Mrs. Todd, who is obsessed with finding shortcuts. Homer admires her persistence but begins to have doubts, as there are only so many shortcuts someone can find. Mrs. Todd's habit of resetting her odometer shows remarkable evidence that something strange is going on. He also discovers evidence that her shortcuts are taking fewer miles than are in a straight line between the trip origin and its destination, something that would be impossible in reality. Mrs. Todd compares the shortcuts to folding a map to bring two points closer together, suggesting she has discovered a warped version of reality, akin to a wormhole. Mrs. Todd finally convinces Homer to take one of the special 'shortcuts'. Homer loses his hat to the grasping arms of a living tree. Soon, he encounters road signs and bizarre animals which he cannot explain. Frightened, Homer doesn't wish to take any more rides. Nonetheless, Mrs. Todd is changing and growing younger with each trip she takes, and the appeal of this overwhelms Homer, despite him discovering a horrifying rodent-like creature on the grill of her car. She brushes this off, seeing the creature as an unfortunate yet normal animal. In the end, Homer, who is looking younger himself, gets into Mrs. Todd's car in front of his friend. It's implied that Mrs. Todd (who by this time is considered to be a missing person together with her car) will now take him into whatever new world which she has found a shortcut to. References to other works A reference to Cujo is made when the story mentions Joe Camber getting killed by his own dog. The roads that Mrs. Todd discovers bear a strong resemblance to the \\"highways in hiding\\" in The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla. Father Callahan, introduced in 'Salem's Lot, travels these roads through todash space, discovering parallel versions of the United States. After Mrs Todd returns from one of her travels, hanging from the front grill of the car is a \\" horrifying rodent-like creature\\" described in the book as \\"something that came from a mating of a woodchuck and a weasel... there was claws sprung from the pads of its feet like a cat's claws only longer. It had big yellowy eyes....and long thin teeth looking like needles sticking out of its mouth.\\" \\"it had hung its own self on by the teeth....it jumped at the Go-Devil when it saw it was about to be run down, trying to bite it to death.\\" This description bears a striking similarity to the billy-bumbler of The Dark Tower series, which is also described with yellow or gold ringed eyes, with sharp teeth and similar to a woodchuck and a raccoon. In The Waste Lands, Jake dreams of running after Oy the billy- bumbler. who heads to the train tracks ready to leap up and fight Blaine the Mono head on as it barrels down the track.The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands The method of travelling quickly using a parallel world is also used to good effect in The Talisman, a novel by Stephen King and Peter Straub, where the characters 'flip' between worlds and can reduce their journey times in the 'real world' by travelling for part of the time in the 'parallel world'.

It includes four titles in the Pac-Man series ‚Äî the original Pac-Man (1980), Pac-Mania (1987), Pac-Attack (1993), and Pac-Man Arrangement (1996), the last of which was originally exclusive to the arcade game Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2. Each game includes customizable features such as the ability to alter the number of starting lives or difficulty, with all being stripped of multiplayer features. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania and Arrangement were originally released for arcades, while Pac-Attack was first released for both the SNES and Sega Genesis. Development of the game was headed by California-based studio Mass Media, who previously worked on several Namco Museum collections for other platforms. It was first announced on April 24, 2001 under the name Pac-Man Fever, before being presented at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) tradeshow. Pac-Man Collection was a commercial success ‚Äî by 2007 it sold over 2.9 million copies worldwide, making it the ninth best-selling Game Boy Advance game of all time. Critics reacted positively to the title's selection of games and customizable features, although some criticized the exclusion of games such as Ms. Pac-Man and inability to save high-scores. It was re-released as a budget title in Japan in 2006, and later digitally on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. Games In-game screenshot, showing the player highlighting Pac-Man Arrangement in the main menu. Pac-Man Collection includes four games from Namco's Pac-Man franchise ‚Äî the original Pac-Man (1980), Pac-Mania (1987), Pac-Attack (1993) and Pac-Man Arrangement (1996), the later of which was originally exclusive to the compilation arcade game Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania and Arrangement were originally released for arcades, while Pac-Attack was first released for both the SNES and Sega Genesis in North America and Europe. Ms. Pac-Man is excluded from the compilation due to the game already being present in the Namco Museum collection for the system from a few months prior. The original Pac-Man can be displayed in either full-screen or a scrolling display. Excluding Pac-Attack, each of the games allow the player to alter the number of lives, game difficulty and other related options. All four of the games are also stripped of any multiplayer features. Pac-Attack also has its soundtrack cut down due to storage capacity, while Arrangements is in a lower bit-rate. Development and release Pac-Man Collection was released on July 13, 2001 in North America, December 7, 2001 in Europe, and on January 11, 2002 in Japan. Development of the game was headed by California-based studio Mass Media, who previously worked with Namco on several Namco Museum collections for various platforms. The game was first announced on April 24 under the working title Pac-Man Fever, before being presented at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) convention in Los Angeles, California. It is Namco's second title released for the Game Boy Advance, following Namco Museum from earlier that year. In Japan, the game was re-released under the Value Selection budget brand on February 2, 2006. Alongside the Family Computer conversion of Pac- Land, it was digitally re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console on June 11, 2014 to celebrate Pac-Man's inclusion as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS & Wii U. Reception Pac-Man Collection was received positively by reviewers, who commended the title for its selection of titles and customizable features. It holds a 79/100 on aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The game was also a commercial success; it became the 6th best-selling handheld game in North America between January 2000 and August 2006, selling over 1.6 million copies and generating more than $25 million in revenue. By 2007 it sold over 2.9 million copies worldwide, making it the ninth best-selling Game Boy Advance game of all time. IGN, who gave it the \\"Editor's Choice\\" award, stated that the game's selection of titles made it an easy sell for Pac-Man fans, while Allgame called it a must-own for its customization features and inclusion of Pac-Man Arrangement. Allgame also praised the collection's sharp graphics and impressive 3D effects in games such as Pac-Mania. In their brief review, GamePro noted of the game's responsive controls and fast-paced action of Pac-Man Arrangement. GameSpy found the selection of titles and solid emulation quality to make it \\"worthwhile addition to any retro fans portable library\\", saying that the original Pac-Man alone made it worth a purchase. GameSpot especially praised its high-quality ports and replay value, saying that it helps prove that classic video games and handheld systems blend well together. Pocket Games magazine liked that Pac-Attack help bring a change of pace from the other included titles, while also praising the game's emulation quality and included titles. Some critics disliked the game's lack of additional titles and inability to save high scores. GameSpy particularly disliked the compilation's lack of Ms. Pac-Man, the \\"only Pac sequel truly worth playing\\", while IGN felt slightly disappointed towards the exclusion of games such as Super Pac-Man and Pac-Man Plus. IGN was also slightly critical of the game's lack of high-score saving, although noted that the games automatically wiping scores anyway made this somewhat forgivable. Pocket Games found Pac-Attack to be the weakest of the four due to its lack of innovation compared to other similar puzzle games. French publication Pocket Magazine was the most negative towards the game, calling it \\"old junk\\" for its lack of multiplayer features and high score saving, while also disliking its price point for being too high.

Mager (1885‚Äì1950) was a French musician, and principal trumpet with the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1919 until his death in 1950. He was a renowned trumpeter in Paris before the First World War, playing at the Paris Opera, Concerts Lamoureux, and the Concerts of the Society of the Conservatory. He also had an alternate career as a singer in the duo with his wife Claire, a well-known soprano, and had hoped for an operatic career. After serving in the French army during the war he came to America as flugelhorn soloist with the Garde Republicaine Band and was engaged to play in the Boston Symphony, first as a violist, since there was no vacancy for trumpet, sharing a stand with Arthur Fiedler. He assumed the first trumpet position in 1920. Trained in France, he was a student of J. Mellet (a student of Jean-Baptiste Arban) at the Paris Conservatory. He was an advocate of use of the C trumpet as an orchestral instrument and had great influence on its development and acceptance in America, working most notably with Vincent Bach.Hempley, Roy & Lehrer, Doug, TO THE BACK OF THE CONCERT HALL THE EVOLUTION OF BACH STRADIVARIUS C TRUMPETS, 2011 at http://www.bachbrass.com/bachology/article.php?uid=12 retrieved 26 August 2011 He also was the first trumpeter in America to play Bach's Brandenburg Concerto in the original high tessitura. Mager was on the faculty of the New England Conservatory, and was a teacher to some of the most influential trumpeters of the mid-twentieth century, including Adolph Herseth (who became principal trumpet of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra), Roger Voisin (who replaced Mager as principal trumpet of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1950, Bernard Adelstein (who became principal trumpet of the Cleveland Orchestra), Irving Sarin (who became principal trumpet of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and respected teacher in his own right), and Renold Schilke (who joined the trumpet section of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and later became an important trumpet maker). He was also teacher to jazz trumpeter Leon Merian. Mager also made important contributions to the trumpet literature through several editions of French solo works, including Guillaume Balay's Petite Piece Concertante, Henri Dallier's Fete Joyeuse, and Georges Hue's Solo De Concert.

It is native to the coral reefs of the tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean. Individuals are small (less than 110 mm standard length) and rarely live longer than two years. They form large schools over the reef and are important cleaner fish in the reefs they inhabit. Distribution and habitat Thalassoma bifasciatum is found in coral reefs of the Atlantic Ocean. Its main range includes the Caribbean Sea and the southeast area of the Gulf of Mexico. Description Juvenile/initial phase bluehead wrasse Young/small females and males have yellow upper bodies and white lower bodies, often with green or black lateral stripes and occasionally dark vertical bars. This coloration is known as the initial phase. They can rapidly alter the presence or intensity of their yellow color, stripes, and bars, and these color changes appear to correspond to behavioral changes. Large females and some males can permanently change coloration and/or sex and enter the terminal phase coloration, which has a blue head, black and white bars behind the head, and a green body. This color phase gives the species its name. Terminal phase males are larger (70 to 80 mm) than the initial phase males (60 mm). Ecology = Diet = Thalassoma bifasciatum forages for zooplankton, mollusks, and other small crustaceans, as well as parasites on other fish. Initial phase males eat primarily zooplankton from currents, and females and initial phase males have certain hunting times during the day. =Predators and parasites= Though Thalassoma bifasciatum is a common cleaner fish in the coral reefs they inhabit, they avoid cleaning piscivores such as the spotted moray, the graysby, and the red hind. Such species will view them as prey, but will not view gobies, another kind of cleaner fish, as prey. Other predators include the greater soapfish, roughtail stingray, and the trumpetfish. A significant parasite of T. bifasciatum is the intracellular myxozoan Kudoa ovivora, which can be found in the ovaries of females. Infected eggs are sterile and are also larger than uninfected eggs, and contain more organic and inorganic material. This implies the parasite causes a shift in resources from the mother to the eggs and decreases the fitness of the mother. Infected bluehead wrasses have been found to change sex earlier than uninfected females, possibly in response to the parasite. Conservation status Thalassoma bifasciatum is widespread in the northwestern Atlantic region and is one of the most abundant species in coral reefs near Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Netherlands Antilles. It is listed under Least Concern. However, this species shows high site fidelity, so coral reef destruction could cause local endangerment. Due to its bright coloration, it is sometimes collected for the aquarium trade, but this is not a threat to the species. Behavior Like many other wrasse species, Thalassoma bifasciatum is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite; individuals may begin life either as males or females, but females can change sex later in life and become males. =Social system= Young T. bifasciatum A specific social system exists within the males - terminal phase males (which are the most aggressive and have the \\"highest\\" ranking among the males) and initial phase males (which mate when they can get a chance in a larger group). Color change of the T. bifasciatum indicates their motive or role. When terminal phase males chase initial phase males, their color changes to a metallic green, whereas when they are courting a female, they become pink/grey and form black circles on their fins. =Sex change= Initial phase females and initial phase males both can change into terminal phase males. This change can be relative quick, taking around 8 days.https://ourblueplanet.bbcearth.com/blog/?article=incredible-sex-changing- fish-from-blue-planet However, this change in sex is permanent: once an initial phase female or male changes into a terminal phase male, it cannot change back. An experiment removing terminal phase males from a population showed that more females changed into terminal phase males, and even aggression levels increased and coloration changes occurred to signify the female's change to terminal phase male. The initial phase males have comparatively larger testes than the larger, terminal phase males. This enables the initial phase males to produce more sperm for the snatched opportunities they must take when trying to fertilize the eggs of the females in the guarded harem. Initial phase (IP) males also achieve fertilizations through participating in group spawns. These groups consist of 20‚Äì50 or more IP males that congregate at specific sites during the daily spawning period on medium and larger sized reefs. Females visit these groups to spawn and release eggs in a 'spawning rush'. IP males attempt to position themselves next to a female when she releases her eggs, as this maximizes their probability of fertilizing these eggs. Releasing large numbers of sperm also increases this probability and this is thought to also help explain the large testis size observed in IP males. This type of mating competition is referred to as 'sperm competition' and is seen in many species. Biological research on sex change Thalassoma bifasciatum and its congener, the saddle wrasse (T. duperrey) have become important models for understanding the physiological and neurobiological bases of sex change. Sex change can be induced socially in both species by making large females the largest members of social groups. Sex change in experimental pens by saddle wrasses involves complete gonadal transformation with associated decreases in a key steroid hormones (estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone) and steroid hormone synthesizing enzymes in the gonads. Sex changing saddle wrasses also show substantial changes in brain levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Initial phase males, terminal phase males, and females have the capability of reproducing. This is due to the protogyny, or the female's ability to become a male. The density of the type of male depends on the size of the reef. There are more terminal phase males than initial phase males on smaller reefs, on which they guard a small number of females. However, on larger reefs, there are equal proportions of initial phase and terminal phase males. This increases the chances of initial phase males to mate because they are less aggressive compared to terminal phase males. Sex change has been studied in bluehead wrasses primarily using field manipulations, where it can be induced in large females by removing dominant terminal phase males from small reefs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons differ across sexual phenotypes in the hypothalamus of bluehead wrasses and also with androgen implants that induce sex change. Behavioral sex change is very rapid in T. bifasciatum under field conditions, with male-typical behaviors being observed within minutes to hours after dominant terminal phase males are removed. Behavioral sex change occurs even in females whose gonads (ovaries) have been surgically removed prior to becoming socially dominant. Behavioral sex change is associated with increases in expression of a neuropeptide hormone termed arginine vasotocin or AVT and these increases occur regardless of whether sex changing females have gonads or not. Injections of AVT can induce sexual and aggressive behaviors in terminal phase male bluehead wrasses while injections of fluoxetine (tradename: Prozac) can reduce aggressive behaviors by terminal phase males. =Mating systems= Large terminal phase males will defend breeding sites to which females migrate on a daily basis. A study was done to estimate the relative roles of each sex in choosing the location of such sites. All terminal phase males or all females were replaced in local isolated populations, and the resulting site use was monitored. After males were replaced, the mating system was not affected. On the other hand, after the females were replaced, half of the old sites were lost and the same number of new sites came into use, and continued to be occupied for over a year after these manipulations. This occurred although large males originally continued to defend and display at the original sites. Therefore, this shows the importance of female choice in the feeding system of the blue-headed wrasse, and that males will respond to the females‚Äô site preferences. T. bifasciatum do not have distinct territories and their populations roam freely. Also, the females usually do not leave their original spawning spots. The males are known be taken away or leave. A plausible reason for why the females stay could be that they are most accustomed to those areas, and also because the predator threat is constant. Most of the literature on mating systems of the blue-headed wrasse was described in small patches of concentrated reef habitats. In a large, linear barrier reef in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, very large aggregations of group-matings form daily in a single area near the foreside of the reef. Tagging studies have shown that fish are generally faithful to particular feeding schools that are assorted throughout the forereef, and that they tend to migrate to spawning grounds over 1.5 kilometers away. There is no mating that appears to happen in other upcurrent areas of the forereef. Despite large differences in the times that are spent on the migration, there are no significant differences in the fecundity or frequency of spawning among females that live at different distances from the mating aggregation. The higher growth rate corresponded to a higher general feeding rate in the location, suggesting that food intake may outweigh the costs of the long migration.

It is particularly useful for summing divergent asymptotic series, and in some sense gives the best possible sum for such series. There are several variations of this method that are also called Borel summation, and a generalization of it called Mittag-Leffler summation. Definition There are (at least) three slightly different methods called Borel summation. They differ in which series they can sum, but are consistent, meaning that if two of the methods sum the same series they give the same answer. Throughout let A(z) denote a formal power series :A(z) = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty a_kz^k, and define the Borel transform of A to be its equivalent exponential series :\\\\mathcal{B}A(t) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_k}{k!}t^k. = Borel's exponential summation method= Let An(z) denote the partial sum :A_n(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^k. A weak form of Borel's summation method defines the Borel sum of A to be : \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} e^{-t}\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^n}{n!}A_n(z). If this converges at z ‚àà C to some a(z), we say that the weak Borel sum of A converges at z, and write {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{wB}) . =Borel's integral summation method= Suppose that the Borel transform converges for all positive real numbers to a function growing sufficiently slowly that the following integral is well defined (as an improper integral), the Borel sum of A is given by :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t} \\\\mathcal{B}A(tz) \\\\, dt. If the integral converges at z ‚àà C to some a(z), we say that the Borel sum of A converges at z, and write {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\,(\\\\boldsymbol B) . =Borel's integral summation method with analytic continuation= This is similar to Borel's integral summation method, except that the Borel transform need not converge for all t, but converges to an analytic function of t near 0 that can be analytically continued along the positive real axis. Basic properties =Regularity= The methods (B) and (wB) are both regular summation methods, meaning that whenever A(z) converges (in the standard sense), then the Borel sum and weak Borel sum also converge, and do so to the same value. i.e. : \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty a_k z^k = A(z) < \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = A(z) \\\\,\\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{B},\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{wB}). Regularity of (B) is easily seen by a change in order of integration, which is valid due to absolute convergence: if A(z) is convergent at z, then : A(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty a_k z^k = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty a_k \\\\left( \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty e^{-t}t^k dt \\\\right) \\\\frac{z^k}{k!} = \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty e^{-t} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty a_k \\\\frac{(tz)^k}{k!}dt, where the rightmost expression is exactly the Borel sum at z. Regularity of (B) and (wB) imply that these methods provide analytic extensions to A(z). =Nonequivalence of Borel and weak Borel summation= Any series A(z) that is weak Borel summable at z ‚àà C is also Borel summable at z. However, one can construct examples of series which are divergent under weak Borel summation, but which are Borel summable. The following theorem characterises the equivalence of the two methods. :Theorem (). :Let A(z) be a formal power series, and fix z ‚àà C, then: :# If {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{wB}) , then {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum}a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{B}). :# If {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{B}) , and \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} e^{-t}\\\\mathcal B A(zt) = 0, then {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{wB}) . =Relationship to other summation methods= * (B) is the special case of Mittag-Leffler summation with Œ± = 1\\\\. * (wB) can be seen as the limiting case of generalized Euler summation method (E,q) in the sense that as q -> ‚àû the domain of convergence of the (E,q) method converges up to the domain of convergence for (B).Hardy, G. H. (1992). Divergent Series. AMS Chelsea, Rhode Island. Uniqueness theorems There are always many different functions with any given asymptotic expansion. However, there is sometimes a best possible function, in the sense that the errors in the finite-dimensional approximations are as small as possible in some region. Watson's theorem and Carleman's theorem show that Borel summation produces such a best possible sum of the series. =Watson's theorem= Watson's theorem gives conditions for a function to be the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. Suppose that f is a function satisfying the following conditions: *f is holomorphic in some region z < R, arg(z) < /2 + Œµ for some positive R and Œµ. *In this region f has an asymptotic series a0 + a1z + ... with the property that the error :f(z)-a_0 -a_1z -\\\\cdots -a_{n-1}z^{n-1} is bounded by :C^{n+1}n!z^n for all z in the region (for some positive constant C). Then Watson's theorem says that in this region f is given by the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. More precisely, the series for the Borel transform converges in a neighborhood of the origin, and can be analytically continued to the positive real axis, and the integral defining the Borel sum converges to f(z) for z in the region above. Slightly more generally, f is still determined by its asymptotic series if the n! in the error estimate above is replaced by kn! provided the condition arg(z) < /2 + Œµ is replaced by arg(z) < k/2 + Œµ. This is in some sense best possible, as there are counterexamples if the number k/2 is replaced by any smaller number. =Carleman's theorem= Carleman's theorem shows that a function is uniquely determined by an asymptotic series in a sector provided the errors in the finite order approximations do not grow too fast. More precisely it states that if f is analytic in the interior of the sector z < C, Re(z) > 0 and f(z) < bnzn in this region for all n, then f is zero provided that the series 1/b0 + 1/b1 + ... diverges. Carleman's theorem gives a summation method for any asymptotic series whose terms do not grow too fast, as the sum can be defined to be the unique function with this asymptotic series in a suitable sector if it exists. Borel summation is slightly weaker than special case of this when bn =cn for some constant c. More generally one can define summation methods slightly stronger than Borel's by taking the numbers bn to be slightly larger, for example bn = cnlog n or bn =cnlog n log log n. In practice this generalization is of little use, as there are almost no natural examples of series summable by this method that cannot also be summed by Borel's method. =Example= The function f(z) = exp(‚Äì1/z) has the asymptotic series 0 + 0z+ ... with an error bound of the form above in the region arg(z) < Œ∏ for any Œ∏ < /2, but is not given by the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. This shows that the number /2 in Watson's theorem cannot be replaced by any smaller number (unless the bound on the error is made smaller). Examples =The geometric series= Consider the geometric series :A(z) = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty z^k, which converges (in the standard sense) to 1/(1 ‚àí z) for z < 1\\\\. The Borel transform is :\\\\mathcal{B}A(tz) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^k}{k!}t^k = e^{zt}, from which we obtain the Borel sum :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t}\\\\mathcal{B}A(tz) \\\\, dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t} e^{tz} \\\\, dt =\\\\frac{1}{1-z} which converges in the larger region Re(z) < 1, giving an analytic continuation of the original series. Considering instead the weak Borel transform, the partial sums are given by AN(z) = (1 ‚àí zN+1)/(1 ‚àí z), and so the weak Borel sum is : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}e^{-t} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1 -z^{n+1}}{1-z} \\\\frac{t^n}{n!} = \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{e^{-t}}{1-z} \\\\big( e^t - z e^{tz} \\\\big) = \\\\frac{1}{1-z}, where, again, convergence is on Re(z) < 1\\\\. Alternatively this can be seen by appealing to part 2 of the equivalence theorem, since for Re(z) < 1 : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} e^{-t} (\\\\mathcal{B} A)(zt) = e^{t(z-1)} = 0. =An alternating factorial series= Consider the series :A(z) = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty k!(-1 \\\\cdot z)^k, then A(z) does not converge for any nonzero z ‚àà C. The Borel transform is :\\\\mathcal{B}A(t) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left(-1 \\\\cdot t\\\\right)^k = \\\\frac{1}{1+t} for t < 1, which can be analytically continued to all t ‚â• 0\\\\. So the Borel sum is :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t}\\\\mathcal{B}A(tz) \\\\, dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-t}} {1+tz} \\\\, dt = \\\\frac 1 z \\\\cdot e^{1/z} \\\\cdot \\\\Gamma\\\\left(0,\\\\frac 1 z \\\\right) (where Œì is the incomplete gamma function). This integral converges for all z ‚â• 0, so the original divergent series is Borel summable for all such z. This function has an asymptotic expansion as z tends to 0 that is given by the original divergent series. This is a typical example of the fact that Borel summation will sometimes \\"correctly\\" sum divergent asymptotic expansions. Again, since : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} e^{-t} (\\\\mathcal B A)(zt) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{e^{-t}}{1 + zt} = 0, for all z, the equivalence theorem ensures that weak Borel summation has the same domain of convergence, z ‚â• 0\\\\. =An example in which equivalence fails= The following example extends on that given in . Consider :A(z) = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\left( \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^\\\\ell(2\\\\ell + 2)^k}{(2\\\\ell+1)!} \\\\right) z^k. After changing the order of summation, the Borel transform is given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal B A(t)&= \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\big((2\\\\ell+2) t\\\\big)^k}{k!} \\\\right) \\\\frac{(-1)^\\\\ell}{(2\\\\ell+1)!}  &= \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty e^{(2\\\\ell+2)t}\\\\frac{(-1)^\\\\ell}{(2\\\\ell+1)!}  &= e^t \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\big(e^t\\\\big)^{2\\\\ell+1} \\\\frac{(-1)^\\\\ell}{(2\\\\ell+1)!}  & = e^t \\\\sin(e^t). \\\\end{align} At z = 2 the Borel sum is given by : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^t \\\\sin(e^{2t}) \\\\, dt = \\\\int_1^\\\\infty \\\\sin(u^2) \\\\, du = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8}} - S(1) < \\\\infty, where S(x) is the Fresnel integral. Via the convergence theorem along chords, the Borel integral converges for all z ‚â§ 2 (clearly the integral diverges for z > 2). For the weak Borel sum we note that : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} e^{(z-1)t}\\\\sin(e^{zt}) = 0 holds only for z < 1, and so the weak Borel sum converges on this smaller domain. Existence results and the domain of convergence =Summability on chords= If a formal series A(z) is Borel summable at z0 ‚àà C, then it is also Borel summable at all points on the chord Oz0 connecting z0 to the origin. Moreover, there exists a function a(z) analytic throughout the disk with radius Oz0 such that : {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum} a_kz^k = a(z) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol B), for all z = Œ∏z0, Œ∏ ‚àà [0,1]. An immediate consequence is that the domain of convergence of the Borel sum is a star domain in C. More can be said about the domain of convergence of the Borel sum, than that it is a star domain, which is referred to as the Borel polygon, and is determined by the singularities of the series A(z). =The Borel polygon= Suppose that A(z) has strictly positive radius of convergence, so that it is analytic in a non-trivial region containing the origin, and let SA denote the set of singularities of A. This means that P ‚àà SA if and only if A can be continued analytically along the open chord from 0 to P, but not to P itself. For P ‚àà SA, let LP denote the line passing through P which is perpendicular to the chord OP. Define the sets : \\\\Pi_P = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\, \\\\colon \\\\, Oz \\\\cap L_P = \\\\varnothing \\\\\\\\}, the set of points which lie on the same side of LP as the origin. The Borel polygon of A is the set : \\\\Pi_A = \\\\operatorname{cl}\\\\left( \\\\bigcap_{P \\\\in S_A} \\\\Pi_P \\\\right). An alternative definition was used by Borel and Phragm√©n . Let S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C} denote the largest star domain on which there is an analytic extension of A, then \\\\Pi_A is the largest subset of S such that for all P \\\\in \\\\Pi_A the interior of the circle with diameter OP is contained in S . Referring to the set \\\\Pi_A as a polygon is somewhat of a misnomer, since the set need not be polygonal at all; if, however, A(z) has only finitely many singularities then \\\\Pi_A will in fact be a polygon. The following theorem, due to Borel and Phragm√©n provides convergence criteria for Borel summation. :Theorem . :The series A(z) is (B) summable at all z \\\\in \\\\operatorname{int}(\\\\Pi_A), and is (B) divergent at all z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\setminus \\\\Pi_A. Note that (B) summability for z \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Pi_A depends on the nature of the point. Example 1 Let œâi ‚àà C denote the m-th roots of unity, i = 1, ..., m, and consider : \\\\begin{align} A(z) & = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (\\\\omega_1^k + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega_m^k)z^k  & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\omega_iz}, \\\\end{align} which converges on B(0,1) ‚äÇ C. Seen as a function on C, A(z) has singularities at SA = {œâi : i = 1, ..., m}, and consequently the Borel polygon \\\\Pi_A is given by the regular m-gon centred at the origin, and such that 1 ‚àà C is a midpoint of an edge. Example 2 The formal series : A(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty z^{2^k}, converges for all z < 1 (for instance, by the comparison test with the geometric series). It can however be shown that A does not converge for any point z ‚àà C such that z2n = 1 for some n. Since the set of such z is dense in the unit circle, there can be no analytic extension of A outside of B(0,1). Subsequently the largest star domain to which A can be analytically extended is S = B(0,1) from which (via the second definition) one obtains \\\\Pi_A = B(0,1) . In particular one sees that the Borel polygon is not polygonal. =A Tauberian theorem= A Tauberian theorem provides conditions under which convergence of one summation method implies convergence under another method. The principal Tauberian theorem for Borel summation provides conditions under which the weak Borel method implies convergence of the series. :Theorem . If A is (wB) summable at z0 ‚àà C, {\\\\textstyle \\\\sum}a_kz_0^k = a(z_0) \\\\, (\\\\boldsymbol{wB}) , and :: a_kz_0^k = O(k^{-1/2}), \\\\qquad \\\\forall k \\\\geq 0, :then \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty a_kz_0^k = a(z_0) , and the series converges for all z < z0. Applications Borel summation finds application in perturbation expansions in quantum field theory. In particular in 2-dimensional Euclidean field theory the Schwinger functions can often be recovered from their perturbation series using Borel summation . Some of the singularities of the Borel transform are related to instantons and renormalons in quantum field theory . Generalizations Borel summation requires that the coefficients do not grow too fast: more precisely, an has to be bounded by n!Cn+1 for some C. There is a variation of Borel summation that replaces factorials n! with (kn)! for some positive integer k, which allows the summation of some series with an bounded by (kn)!Cn+1 for some C. This generalization is given by Mittag-Leffler summation. In the most general case, Borel summation is generalized by Nachbin resummation, which can be used when the bounding function is of some general type (psi-type), instead of being exponential type.

Early life The firstborn to Burvena and George Robert Brown, Derwin was raised in Long Island, New York, where he attended Woodfield Road School and Malverne Jr. High School for his elementary years of grade school and Malverne High School. http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,97096-2,00.html Career Derwin Brown first served DeKalb as a youth counselor for troubled teens and soon became one of the county's first black patrol officers. He later hosted his own local TV segment called \\"The Naked Truth\\" and was the author of his own column in The Champion News Paper (local newspaper) called \\"Tell It Like It Is\\". Brown was a 23-year veteran of the DeKalb County Police Department when he was elected to the position of Sheriff on a platform of cleaning up the corruption and graft that had historically troubled the DeKalb County Sheriff's Office. Assassination On December 15, 2000, former Deputy Melvin Walker shot Brown twelve times with a TEC-9 handgun in front of his suburban Atlanta home. Walker was promised a promotion to deputy sheriff if he killed Brown. David Ramsey, the backup shooter and getaway driver, was promised a job as a detention officer. Defeated incumbent and former DeKalb County Sheriff Sidney Dorsey was convicted of ordering Brown's assassination. Details that came to light in the trial suggested that Dorsey ordered the killing to obstruct an expected probe into corruption during his tenure as sheriff. The Brown family filed suit against those involved in the killing. After a civil trial found the defendants liable, the family was awarded a judgment of $776M USD. The defense attorneys declined to actually appear on behalf of the defendants at trial; instead, having filed an interlocutory appeal on the issue of liability, they allowed the damages portion of the trial to go forward undefended. The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in Defendant's favor on the issue of whether the state was immune from suit. The plaintiff appealed the ruling up to the Georgia Supreme Court, and that Court upheld the ruling. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on a subsequent appeal filed by Brown's family. After the verdict was rendered virtually uncollectable by the series of failed appeals, a bill was introduced into the Georgia House of Representatives seeking to compensate Brown's family in an amount in excess of $300 million. The bill failed to obtain the necessary votes for passage. On July 13, 2007, Dorsey confessed to investigators that he had ordered Deputy Patrick Cuffy to carry out the killing. However, he claimed he had called the attempt off prior to Brown's assassination. Legacy Derwin and Phyllis Brown had 5 children and 12 grandchildren. Brown's wife, Phyllis Brown, died on Christmas Eve 2006 of heart failure after suffering a debilitating stroke, nine days after leading a candlelight vigil in honor of the anniversary of her husband's murder. Brown was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was also a member of Freemasonry. There is a Masonic Lodge named in his honor, the Derwin Brown Masonic Lodge #599 PHA. Brown's assassination was featured on Investigation Discovery's series Fatal Encounters, season 1, episode 9, ‚ÄúWho Shot the Sheriff?\\".Investigation Discovery Fatal Encounters. \\"Who Shot the Sheriff?\\" https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/fatal-encounters/ The assassination and case were also featured on Oxygen's series Deadly Power, season 1, episode 3, \\"Above the Law\\".

It is located about east of North Nicosia, near the village of Kirklar (Tympou). Flights to the airport are banned internationally. Non-stop flights only take place from Turkey, and all planes that fly to Northern Cyprus from other countries have to stop over in Turkey. Because of these difficulties and inconveniences, the majority of Turkish Cypriots with Republic of Cyprus passports prefer to use Larnaca International Airport, which is located in the internationally-recognised, government-controlled part of Cyprus; this option is not available, however, to Turkish settlers. History Check-in area The precursor of Ercan Airport, Tymvou Airport, was constructed by the British in World War II as a military airport, during their colonial rule of the island. Following the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus and the partition of the island it was occupied by the Turkish army, and today it is used as the main civilian airport of Northern Cyprus. Since 2006, the rule which stipulates that flights are required to touch down at a Turkish airport before continuing to and from Ercan has been under discussion. In 2006, the Turkish government began discussions for Northern Cyprus's main port Famagusta, and main civilian airport Ercan, to be able to operate direct connections, with the UK government describing it as a \\"significant and creative offer\\". However, as of 2017, the rule still applies, and Ercan airport has seen a more than 400% decrease in customers, as a result of new tight security measures imposed by the UK Department for Transport questioning the status of the airport and forcing passengers travelling between Britain and Northern Cyprus to disembark with their luggage and go through a fresh security check in Turkey in order to board a new aircraft for their final destination. Recent plans have arisen to privatise Ercan Airport, as well as plans to enlarge the airport in order to increase capacity. Ercan Airport currently has a 2.5 kilometre-long runway and an apron with a capacity of seven aircraft. Although the runway is long enough for large planes to land, it is not long enough for take-offs. The plan has been for the construction of a new runway, apron and terminal building, with the planned new apron doubling the current plane capacity. As of 2020, te new terminal is currently under construction. It will be much larger than the existing and have 9 airbridges. A new runway is also being constructed alongside the existing one. Airlines and destinations Due to the disputed international status of Northern Cyprus there are no non-stop scheduled flights between Ercan and destinations outside of Turkey. However, several airlines operate direct flights from Ercan to Europe with intermediate stops in Turkey.

He was convicted in 2002 for a price-fixing scheme involving the top two auction houses in the United States. Background Taubman was born in Pontiac, Michigan, on January 31, 1924, to Jewish immigrants Fannie Ester Blustin and Philip Taubman. His parents came to the United States from Bia≈Çystok, in northeastern Poland. His mother was his father's second cousin. Philip took a job with the Wilson Foundry Company in Iowa, transferred to Pontiac in 1920, became a fruit farmer, then began developing commercial real estate and custom homes. Taubman's parents lost everything in the Depression of the 1930s, and Taubman at age 9 had to find work to help support the family. He is a graduate of Pontiac Central High School. Taubman studied architecture at the University of Michigan where he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity and Lawrence Technological University, but graduated from neither.

C√©dric Klapisch wrote and directed the film, whose settings include Paris, London, Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Klapisch makes use of digital and split-screen effects in the film, as well as non-linear narrative. Plot The film begins with friends from L'Auberge espagnole meeting in Saint Petersburg at the wedding of Wendy's brother, William. Xavier begins to reminisce about the events of the past several years. Xavier and Martine have split up and Martine has since had a child and become a committed environmental activist. For financial reasons, Xavier becomes a writer for pulp romantic novels and a ghostwriter, writing the autobiographies of celebrities. Martine criticizes his pulp novel work as being unrealistic and corny. Despite agreeing with this, Xavier replies that he earns good money. In Paris, Xavier has a brief affair with Kassia, a sales clerk from Senegal. When Xavier's grandfather asks about Xavier's fianc√©e, he asks his friend Isabelle, who is a lesbian, to pose as his fianc√©e. In Paris, Xavier runs into Wendy, who has become an accomplished television writer. She is currently involved in an unhealthy relationship. A TV assignment later takes Xavier to London where he had requested to work with Wendy. Xavier is given the chance to ghost write an autobiography of Celia, a successful young model, whom he visits on a number of occasions. On one of these visits Xavier and Celia kiss before sleeping together while looking at the boats on the River Seine. The film shows Xavier and Wendy's attraction to each other growing before developing into a physical relationship. Xavier fights with Wendy's boyfriend which results in Xavier throwing him out. Wendy's brother William has fallen in love with Natasha, a Russian ballerina. He spends a year learning Russian to try to win her over. He succeeds and moves to be with her in Saint Petersburg. Xavier and Wendy go to Russia to stay with William and Natasha. Natasha takes them to see the Street of Ideal Proportions, a street on which the buildings are the same height as the street's width and the street's length is ten times its width. Xavier and Wendy's relationship is going well until Celia calls Xavier and asks him to visit her as she is staying in Moscow. Xavier goes to visit Celia, telling Wendy that he has to see a publisher in Moscow. Xavier does not know that Wendy had looked at his cellphone and seen that the caller was another woman, not the publisher. Saying goodbye at the train station, Wendy tells Xavier what she has seen and explains her true feelings. Xavier is stunned and doesn't move from the train as Wendy walks away crying. In Moscow, Celia and Xavier meet up and sleep together again but some of the attraction between them has gone. Later at a club she asks Xavier to get her a glass of milk. While he is at the bar, Celia runs into some old friends and reluctantly goes with them to another party. After failing to contact one another that night, Xavier and Celia never meet again. Celia can be seen to represent an ideal woman, the type of unattainable fantasy that Xavier has been seeking his whole life. Xavier is aware that, like the Street of Ideal Proportions, she is ultimately uninteresting in her perfection. Xavier subsequently returns to St. Petersburg but finds that Wendy is avoiding him as she is convinced that he had an affair while in Moscow. Towards the end of the film, the scene returns to William and Natasha marrying in front of family members and the characters introduced in L'Auberge Espagnole. Wendy's divorced parents begin to squabble during the reception. Wendy has been avoiding Xavier during the time leading up to the wedding, but she is unhappy at seeing her parents arguing and lets Xavier comfort her. He apologises for his past behaviour and the film ends with Xavier and Wendy embracing.

It was flown with three engines but all of them were either insufficiently developed for service use or their full production was reserved for other fighters already in production. The I-185 program was cancelled on 27 January 1943. Design and development The I-185, designed in early 1940, was based on the I-180, which was itself a development of the I-16, but was virtually a new design. The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, and also had an integral fin, but it was considerably longer than that of the I-180. The two-spar, all-metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I-180's wing, nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire's wing at 13% at the root and tapered to 8% at the wing tip.Gordon and Dexter, pp. 94‚Äì95 The wing had a NACA-230 profile and was skinned in duralumin. Pneumatically powered split flaps and leading edge slats were fitted. The outer wing panels had 3¬∞ of dihedral. The fabric-covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin. The protected fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars. The I-185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel. The unproven 1,492 kW (2,000 hp) 18-cylinder, two-row Tumansky M-90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes. It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I-180 to provide additional thrust.Gunston, p. 308 The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage, two ShKAS machine guns and two Berezin UBS machine guns. A bomb could be carried under overload conditions. The first prototype was completed in May 1940, but the only available example of the M-90 did not provide enough power for take-off. The prototype was modified to use another experimental engine, the Shvetsov M-81 radial, but this was not nearly powerful enough for flight tests. The I-185 (M-81) finally took to the air on January 11, 1941, but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M-81 was cancelled in May 1941.Gordon and Dexter, p. 95 A second prototype was completed at the end of 1940 with a 14-cylinder, 1,268 kW (1,700 hp) Shvetsov M-82A radial engine. The forward fuselage had to be redesigned to accommodate the slimmer engine and the armament was revised to three synchronized ShVAK cannon. The drawings for this engine installation was passed to Lavochkin and Yakovlev where they proved very useful in designing their own fighters using the M-82 engine, notably the Lavochkin La-5. A third prototype was also built that used the larger and heavier Shvetsov M-71 radial engine of 1,492 kW (2,000 hp). The flight tests of both of the latter versions were interrupted by the German invasion in June 1941 and all three prototypes, along with the entire Polikarpov design bureau, were evacuated to Novosibirsk.Gordon and Dexter, pp. 95‚Äì96 Flight testing resumed in early 1942 and the M-71-powered versions, which now included the re-engined first prototype, proved to be faster than the Messerschmitt Bf 109F by at sea level and at with a top speed of at that altitude.Gordon and Dexter, pp. 96, 100 It was recommended for immediate production, even before it began combat trials in November 1942. All three aircraft were assigned to the 728th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 3rd Air Army of the Kalinin Front and were tightly controlled to prevent the loss of the prototypes. For example, all sorties had to be flown over Soviet- controlled territory and required the express permission of the 3rd Air Army staff to fly.Gordon and Dexter, p. 100 Pilots' reports were quite enthusiastic; the 728th's commander, Captain Vasilyaka wrote: \\"The I-185 outclasses both Soviet and foreign aircraft in level speed. It performs aerobatic maneuvers easily, rapidly and vigorously. The I-185 is the best current fighter from the point of control simplicity, speed, maneuverability (especially in climb), armament and survivability.\\"Gordon, p. 275 Based on the glowing report by the NII VVS (Nauchno-Issledovatel'skiy Institut Voyenno- Vozdushnykh Sil‚ÄîAir Force Scientific Test Institute) in early 1942 preparations began to put the I-185 (M-71) into production. A 'production standard setter (etalon)' aircraft was built in April 1942 with a redesigned engine cowling. Its gross weight increased by over the earlier prototypes, but the reduction in drag from the new cowling was significant and the top speed increased to at 5000 meters. It underwent manufacturer's tests between June and October and was submitted for the State acceptance tests on 18 November. However, flight testing was interrupted by the need to replace the engine between 17 December 1942 and 26 January 1943. The new engine failed the next day and the aircraft crashed on 27 January. Flight tests were ordered to be continued with the original prototypes to validate the range figures, but the first prototype crashed on 5 April, killing the pilot as he attempted a dead- stick landing.Gordon, pp. 275‚Äì76 All work to put the I-185 into production was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.Gordon and Dexter, p. 101 Variants Polikarpov began preliminary design of two updated versions of the I-185 design in February 1943. The I-187 had a M-71F engine of 1,640 kW (2,200 hp), a bubble canopy, four 20 mm cannons, eight RS-82 rockets and an estimated maximum speed of 710 km/h (441 mph). The I-188 used an improved M-90 engine with 1,552 kW (2,080 hp) and used the same armament as the I-187, although the fuselage was slimmer than that of the I-187 because of the slimmer engine.Gordon, p. 277 Specifications (I-185 (M-71 etalon)) See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Abanshin, Michael E. and Gut, Nina.

The lake is within the Valley of Mexico hydrological basin, in central Mexico. History =Geologic= Lake Xochimilco is part of a series of historical lakes, which included: :# Lake Texcoco ‚Äî brackish :# Lake Zumpango :# Lake Xaltocan :# Lake Chalco ‚Äî fresh water Lake Xochimilco was originally a part of an even larger Lake Texcoco during the last glacial period. Between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago, the climate in central Mexico warmed and the snowmelt that once fed Lake Texcoco virtually disappeared. This caused the lake to drop hundreds of feet over next several thousand years. By 2,000 years ago Xochimilco became a bay in the southern portion of Texcoco. Then around the 13th or 14th century the Aztecs built large causeways effectively creating a new lake. =Mesoamerican= These lakes were the home of many Mesoamerican cultures, including the Teotihuacanos, the Toltecs, and the Aztecs. Due to its shallow waters and the freshwater springs that lined the south shore of the lake, Lake Xochimilco was the center of agriculture in the centuries of the pre-Columbian era. This made the region a prime target for the expansionist Aztecs, who obtained control over the lake in a series of campaigns, from until 1440, during the reign of the Aztec , Itzc√≥atl. =Spanish colonial= After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521, the Spaniards' destruction of the dams and sluice gates in the 1520s, as well as the sharp declines in the native population, led to the near abandonment of the chinampa gardens. Present day Colourful (rafts) on Lake Xochimilco The five lakes within the Valley of Mexico have now largely disappeared, drained to reduce flooding. Only the Xochimilco canals remain from the original Lake Xochimilco. Even today, some still work their chinampa gardens between the canals. Xochimilco Lake remnants are part of large urban parks in Mexico City, with water-based and land recreation. Colourful (rafts) take groups of people on the remaining canals for pleasure. Xochimilco Ecological Park and Plant Market was established as a nature reserve and park, and is the largest park in Mexico City after Chapultepec. There is also the Xochimilco/Cuemanco Plant Market, the largest in Latin America. The market is on chinampa land. =Conservation= The area was declared a biological reserve by the Mexican government in 1984. It became part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Lake Xochimilco was the last remaining native habitat for the axolotl, a species of mole salamander endemic to Mexico. Until Lake Chalco was drained, the species had also been present there. Given Lake Xochimilco's present extensively compromised and reduced state, and the accelerating impact of Mexico City's urban growth, axolotl in the wild are listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN.

Detail from the 1847 Bruff/Disturbell map The Valley of Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, Lake Chalco was an endorheic lake formerly located in the Valley of Mexico, and was important for Mesoamerican cultural development in central Mexico. The lake was named after the ancient city of Chalco on its former eastern shore. Geography Lake Chalco and the other Mexican great lakes (the brackish lakes Texcoco, Zumpango and Xaltocan and the freshwater Xochimilco) formed the ancient Basin of Mexico lake system. These lakes were home to many Mesoamerican cultures including the Toltecs and the Aztecs. Lake Chalco itself had a fresh water hydrologic structure due in large part to the artesian springs lining its south shore. This allowed extensive beds to be cultivated through the Aztec era. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, these beds fell into disuse and were largely abandoned. History Starting during the Aztec era and continuing into 20th century, efforts were made to drain Lake Chalco and her sister lakes in order to avoid periodic flooding and to provide for expansion. The only lakes that are still in existence are a diminished Lake Xochimilco and the Lake of Zumpango. Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco were the original habitat of the axolotl, an amphibian which is now critically endangered and possibly extinct in the wild due to urban destruction. A land speculator's draining of the lake in the late 1860s led to a tenant farmer (campesino) revolt organized by Julio L√≥pez Ch√°vez that was eventually put down by the federal government.

Bringing garden installations together at one venue is unique to The ArtGardens, which aims to promote gardening as a contemporary art genre. The ArtGardens was conceived and developed by Stephanie Flom at Frank Curto Park, a highly visible public green space along Bigelow Boulevard in Pittsburgh.\\"Pitt's Delanie Jenkins Draws From the Physical, Emotional Realms to Engage Audiences.\\" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Pitt Chronicle, January 14, 2008.Stephanie Flom and Art Gardens of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 2, 2002, p. 76. The park runs for one mile along a well-traveled roadway near downtown. Although the gardens in this phase are viewed primarily from the road, the goal is to introduce this art concept to the public and build interest and support for the development of a larger venue that will allow the public to stroll intimately among the installations. Artists are invited through a curatorial process. Garden artists include environmental artists, artists who garden, artists who work with growing plant materials, community gardeners, and backyard gardeners. While sculptural forms may be introduced, growing plant materials must be used as the primary medium. Generally the installations will be on the scale of an average backyard garden. Some gardens may only span a season; others may require maintenance plans for multiple seasons. In the summer of 2002 artists Lily Yeh and Daniel Ladd created the inaugural installations at Frank Curto Park. In 2003, Stephanie Flom and Delanie Jenkins made additional ArtGarden installations. The ArtGardens is a part of The Persephone Project, a resident program of the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University and an activity of the Tides Center of Western Pennsylvania.

He recorded and conveyed knowledge about the places on our planet that had been explored. He significantly contributed to the spreading of knowledge about the world in the Czech society, mainly in the first half of the 20th century.  Life  He was born as a second of five children in Su≈°no by Mlad√° Boleslav in a poor family of a farmer. Since his childhood, he had a passion for music and natural history, which did not change for the rest of his life. He studied in Prague to be a teacher in teacher training programs. During this period, he met a number of travellers in the house U Hal√°nk≈Ø, including Emil Holub, they were born in the same year and they remained close friends for the rest of their lives. As a keen naturalist, Ko≈ôensk√Ω also worked in the Prague Museum, where he assisted Antonin Fritsch.TODOROVOV√Å, Ji≈ôina ‚Äì CHOVANEƒåEK, Jan, Kolem svƒõta, Sb√≠rka fotografi√≠ z cest Josefa Ko≈ôensk√©ho v N√°prstkovƒõ muzeu asijsk√Ωch, africk√Ωch americk√Ωch kultur, N√°rodn√≠ muzeum, Praha, 2011, . His teaching career began in Radnice near Rokycany in 1867. He worked there as an assistant and he continued as a teacher in Litomy≈°l in 1871. In 1874, he was appointed as a teacher in Sm√≠chov, Prague. Prague offered cultural and educational opportunities he was seeking. Maori girl, New Zealand His first bigger travel took place in 1872 during his stay in Litomy≈°l. He visited the Alps and this trip was followed by other tours of Europe, which was repeated almost every summer. He used the opportunity of summer school holidays and the generosity of financial support of individuals such as Vojta N√°prstek, Franti≈°ek Ringhoffer, and associations such as Svatobor, along with Sm√≠chov City Council, school authorities, Viennese Ministry of Culture and Education and other institutions. They were all convinced that Ko≈ôensk√Ω's travels will bring benefits in museum collections and in the knowledge that can be passed by Ko≈ôensk√Ω not only to children, but also to general public. He set off on each journey perfectly prepared, studying available literature and languages. He knew German, French and English, but had no difficulties with other languages, which can be proved by his translations from Norwegian. His itinerary was always clear and precise and his travels were a verification of the facts he had already known from his research. He believed that a teacher should travel as much as possible to be perfectly informed about the situation abroad. Children can be taught only through a genuine personal experience. While on the road, he carefully noted all aspects of the natural world, as well as all features of economic, cultural and religious life of the society. As a teacher, he naturally paid attention to the education of various nations, which then enriched his own teaching practice. He completed two biggest and longest journeys during his lifetime. He travelled around the world and he also visited Australia and New Zealand. His round the world travel started in 1893, he was accompanied by his friend Karel ≈òezn√≠ƒçek (1845‚Äì1914), a beer brewer from Hrub√° Sk√°la. They sailed out the German harbour Bremen, crossing the Atlantic to visit the World's Fair in Chicago. Naturally, other American cities and sights were visited on the way, for example Niagara Falls and Yellowstone National Park. They continued towards the Pacific and then to Japan on a steamship, with a short stopover in Hawaii. China and Hong Kong came next, with further sea voyage to Malay Peninsula and Java before crossing the Indian Ocean to Ceylon. They then continued overland to Darjeeling and under the Himalayas to Mumbai and then again on a steamer to the Red Sea and Egypt to study the ancient Egyptian history. They returned to Prague via Trieste in 1894. Indigenous Australian hunters His second great expedition took place in 1900‚Äì1901. He sailed out of Naples through the Suez Canal to Aden and Colombo and then to West Australian Perth, Adelaide and through Ballarat to Melbourne. His next destination was Tasmania and New Zealand, with Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington, where he met a famous Czech painter Gottfried Lindauer (1839‚Äì1926), who painted portraits of Maori population. From Auckland, he sailed to explore the archipelagos of Oceania ‚Äì Tonga, Samoa and Fiji. He returned to Australia to Sydney and then went by train to Brisbane. His next destination was the island of Celebes, followed by Java, where he visited the temple complex of Borobudur and the city of Bandung and Batavia. Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong came next. He then visited his favourite Japan again, Kobe, Tokyo and Massif Haruna west of Tokyo. From the port Shimonoseki he went to Korea (he stopped in Pusan and Wonsan), then to Vladivostok and along the Amur river, Khabarovsk and along the Trans-Siberian Railway through Irkutsk to Novosibirsk. Finally, across Ural to Moscow and Prague. Ko≈ôensk√Ω never explored any unknown parts of the world, in fact, he more thoroughly explored the known world, he recorded it and mediated the knowledge to his pupils and general public. He was an expert naturalist and a keen collector. He frequently published books on his travels, they were written especially for young people, which had an obvious positive impact on the entire population. He was a member of the younger generation of travellers around Vojta N√°prstek and he was one of the three most popular travellers of young Czechoslovakia, along with Vr√°z and Holub. He greatly contributed to the expanding of the horizons of the Czech nation, who were at that time being gradually integrated into the world.CHOVANEƒåEK, Jan.

He was a member of the Administrative Committee of the National Museum and a number of prestigious institutions, such as the Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovakia. The greatest tribute to his efforts in the field of science was awarded in 1927: an honorary doctorate of Natural Sciences of Charles University. In 1920s', he was the first traveller to be invited as a host to the Czech Radio broadcasts on a regular basis. He died in Sm√≠chov in 1938, at the age of 91.

He was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica. By 1951, he had won ten first prizes in West Indian literary competitions.Hawthorne, Evelyn J. \\"The Writer and the Nationalist Model\\", Roger Mais and the Decolonization of Caribbean Culture, NY: Peter Lang, 1989, p. 7. His integral role in the development of political and cultural nationalism is evidenced in his being awarded the high honour of the Order of Jamaica in 1978.Hawthorne, p. 4. Biography Roger Mais was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and was educated at Calabar High School. He worked at various times as a photographer, insurance salesman, and journalist,Michael Hughes, A Companion to West Indian Literature, Collins, 1979, pp. 83-85. launching his journalistic career as a contributor to the weekly newspaper Public Opinion from 1939 to 1952, which was associated with the People's National Party. He also wrote several plays, reviews, and short stories for Edna Manley's cultural journal, Focus, and the newspaper, The Daily Gleaner; his topics most frequently were the social injustice and inequality suffered by black, poor Jamaicans. He appealed to his local audience on grounds to push for a national identity and agitate against colonialism.Brathwaite, Kamau. \\"Roger Mais\\", Dictionary of Literary Biography, vol. 125: Caribbean and Black African Writers, second series. Detroit: Gale Research, 1993, p. 79. Mais published more than a hundred short stories, most appearing in Public Opinion and Focus. Other stories are collected in Face and Other Stories and And Most of All Man, published in the 1940s.Hawthorne, p. 6. Mais' play, George William Gordon, was also published in the 1940s, focusing on a politician and martyr of the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865. It played an important role in the rehabilitation of the eponymous character. In conventional colonial history Gordon was described as a rebel and traitor, but on the centenary of the rebellion, he was declared to be a Jamaican National Hero.Howard Campbell, \\"Icon: Roger Mais - The visionary behind classic Brother Man\\"], Jamaica Gleaner, 17 April 2007. On 11 July 1944, Roger Mais published, \\"Now we Know\\", a stinging denunciation of British colonialism in Public Opinion, in which he explained that it was now clear that World War 2 was not a fight for freedom but a war to preserve imperial privilege and exploitation: \\"That the sun may never set upon privilege, repression and exploitation and upon the insolence and arrogance of one race to all others ...That the sun may never set upon the great British tradition of Democracy which chains men and women and little children with more than physical chains, chains of ignorance and the apathy of the underfed, and the submissiveness, which is a spiritual sickness in the thews and sinews of a man; chains them in dungeons of gold mines and silver mines and diamond mines, and upon sugar plantations, and upon rubber plantations and tea plantations. For the great idea of Democracy which relegates all ‚Äúniggers‚Äù of whichever race, to their proper place in the scheme of political economy\\" For writing this denunciation of Churchill's declaration that the end of World War 2 would not mean the end of the British Empire, the Jamaican novelist was tried for sedition and imprisoned for six months. This period was instrumental in his development of his first novel, The Hills Were Joyful Together (1953), a work about working-class life in 1940s Kingston. \\"Why I Love and Leave Jamaica\\", an article written in 1950, also stirred emotions in readers. It characterized the bourgeoisie and the \\"philistines\\" as shallow and criticized their influential role on art and culture.Banham, Martin, Errol Hill & George Woodyard (eds), \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Jamaica\\", in The Cambridge Guide to African & Caribbean Theatre. Advisory editor for Africa, Olu Obafemi, Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp. 141-49; 197-202. In addition, Mais wrote more than thirty stage and radio plays. The plays Masks and Paper Hats and Hurricane were performed in 1943, Atlanta in Calydon in 1950; The Potter's Field was published in Public Opinion (1950), and The First Sacrifice in Focus (1956). Mais left Jamaica for England in 1952. He lived in London, then in Paris, and for a time in the south of France. He took an alias, Kingsley Croft, and showcased an art exhibition in Paris. His artwork also appeared on the covers of his novels. In 1953, his novel The Hills Were Joyful Together was published by Jonathan Cape in London. Soon afterwards, Brother Man (1954) was published, a sympathetic exploration of the emergent Rastafarian movement. The next year Black Lightning was published. While Mais' first two novels had urban settings, Black Lightning (1955) featured an artist living in the countryside. In 1955 Mais was forced to return to Jamaica after falling ill with cancer; he died that same year in Kingston at the age of 50.Brathwaite, p. 81. In 1968 he was posthumously awarded the Musgrave Gold Medal by the Institute of Jamaica. His short stories were collected in a volume entitled Listen, The Wind, thirty-two years after his death. Mais' novels have been republished posthumously several times, an indication of his continuing importance to Caribbean literary history. He also had an influence on younger writers of the pre-independence period, notably John Hearne. Many of Mais' manuscripts have been deposited in the library of the University of the West Indies, Jamaica and there is an online collection. The University of the West Indies, Trinidad also hold a Roger Mais Collection. Novels The Hills Were Joyful Together (1953) is written in the style of a narrative. It takes place in a \\"yard\\" consisting of individuals and families living in a confinement of shacks shaped squarely, leaving a yard in the center. In this yard, daily and public life of the tenement unfolds. Mais took inspiration from Trinidadian C. L. R. James's novel Minty Alley and short story \\"Triumph\\", which illustrated \\"yard\\" life. Mais's The Hills Were Joyful Together is basically a depiction of slum life, portraying the upset of poverty in these yards. Mais claimed that he was \\"concerned with setting down objectively the hopes, fears, [and] frustrations of these people\\".Hawthorne, p. 17. He wanted the novel to be \\"essentially realistic, even to the point of seeming violent, rude, expletive, functional, primitive, raw\\". Brother Man (London: Cape, 1954) stood as a statement of protest, as well as being a major contributor to a nativist aesthetic. Mais was interested in the creole, the political reconstructionism of the 1930s, and the sociocultural problems of the \\"yards.\\" There was a need for a nativist aesthetic. There was talk about a renewed self-government and the formation of a West Indian federation, provoking writers and intellectuals from the region to reflect on this optimistic future and to search for forms to give it a local face.Brathwaite, p. 80. Brother Man was Mais's contribution to this movement. The novel is situated in Kingston's slums. It portrays the daily condition of poverty of the society. Kamau Brathwaite refers to this as the \\"jazz novel\\", where the \\"words are 'notes' that develop into riffs, themes, and 'choruses,' themselves part of a call/response design based on the aesthetic principle of solo/duo/trio improvisations, with a return, at the end of each 'chorus,' to the basic group/ensemble community.\\" Brathwaite, pp. 79-80. Unlike the first two novels, Black Lightning (1955) takes place in the countryside. The novel centres on Jake, a blacksmith and a sculptor. He looks to Samson as a model of a man's independence and decides to carve a structure of Samson in mahogany. But when his wife elopes with another man, Jake's finished sculpture comes out as a blinded Samson leaning on a little boy. Jake is then blinded by lightning and has to depend on his friends to live. The tragic discovery of his dependence on humanity eventually drives Jake to his suicidal death.Ramchand, \\"The Achievement of Roger Mais\\", The West Indian Novel and its Background. London: Heinemann, 1983, pp. 185-86. Political involvement In 1938, major riots and uprising broke out all throughout the Caribbean islands (primarily in Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad). In Jamaica, riots emerged in the 1938 Montego Bay and among the banana loaders, firemen, and sanitation workers in Kingston. It was in Kingston, where Mais was headed to volunteer to help quell the rioting, that he had an apparent change of heart. He seemingly emerged with a completely alternative mindset, as explained in John Hearne's 1955 \\"A Personal Memoir\\", and took the side of the workers/rioters. Many saw this as the event that spurred Mais' political involvement. At the end of this critical year, new leaders, including Mais, appropriately emerged to direct and push for political and social changes.Hawthorne. Roger Mais' works, which include short stories, plays, reviews, and \\"think pieces\\" among other genres,Brathwaite, pp. 78-81. all generally have a political undertone to some degree. He contributed to a left-wing political newspaper called Public Opinion from 1939 to 1952 before he left Jamaica. The other writers of the post-1930s had similar ambitions, a period being characterized as \\"a more determined and confident nationalism.\\" His stories appeared in Public Opinion and Focus, two journalistic publications. He also published two collections, Face and Other Stories and And Most of All Man. His main concerns were social injustice/inequality and colonialism. His stories and poems have been described as \\"propaganda\\", where he illustrated poverty to the full extent. Some have gone so far as to say that his works were \\"weapons of war\\", dealt \\"in a long and famous stream of realism\\" (Norman Washington Manley). This sort of realism allowed for his readers/audience to understand the poverty in a way which was brutally honest. Examples of these works are The Hills Were Joyful Together and Brother Man. He adamantly denounced England as \\"exploitive\\", \\"enslaving\\", and disloyal and Winston Churchill for \\"hypocrisy and deception\\". Subsequently, Mais was charged with sedition and sentenced to a six-month sentence. The Jamaican public was sympathetic to his imprisonment and helped to incite controversy and public commotion. It is in this sense that Mais was able to involve the Rastafari movement, a Jamaican cultural movement, in his novel Brother Man, in which he is able to identify with the anti-colonialism and afrocentrism of the Rastafari movement. Arguably, another important political contribution was his work to build a national identity, and he did this by: \\"'nativizing' the subjects and concerns of his writing\\", \\"supplying a corrective to colonialism by [...] reclaiming subverted or disregarded histories\\", and \\"gave authority to the island's language and voice\\" (Hawthorne). This essentially means he would intentionally present protagonists that spoke in the local West Indian dialect to connect with his local audience, a significant change in attitude from previous works by other authors. Mais would also include nationalist propaganda demonstrating forgotten Jamaican culture and history. Other similar influential writers of Jamaican heritage include Vera Bell, Claude Thompson, Una Marson, John Hearne, Philip Sherlock, John Figueroa, and Louise Bennett-Coverly. Influences Raised into a middle-class family with full access to \\"cultured\\" traditions, Mais often incorporated a romantic idea into his writings.Hawthorne, p. 21. He drew from his Western education inspirations that lead to his use of \\"tragic,\\" \\"visionary,\\" and \\"poetic\\" elements within books and plays. His belief in individualism and the writer's freedom to pursue imagination are reflected in many of his early works. However, Mais later recognized the tension between his colonial heritage and the nationalist movement and changed direction. By adopting a realistic stance, Mais decided to assume a literary style that would be more representative of the Caribbean national consciousness.Hawthorne, p. 23. This particular form allowed Mais to present \\"unambiguous, direct truths about the people and culture.\\" Many of his later novels thus portray sufferings and despairs undergone by innocent people under British rule. One inspiration that he wove into his writings sprang from the 1938 People's National Party that was launched by Norman Manley. The movement aimed to grant Jamaica self-government, which sparked concurrent enthusiasm within the literary field. Besides Roger Mais another author, Vic Reid also incorporated into his works Manley's ambitious drive to independence. Reid's novel New Day is a historical account of Jamaica from 1865 to 1944. Like Mais, Reid finds primary sources particularly useful in modeling political messages into stories. Mais and Caribbean drama During the 1930s, the first endeavours were made to write and introduce plays related to Caribbean life. Before that period, plays were European-based, with European actors as well. Shows consisted of Romeo and Juliet and reading of Shakespearian plays, but progress towards expressing Caribbean life was being made. The year symbolized an advance for Caribbean theatre.Banham, Hill, Woodyard, p. 199. The desire to represent local life and history of the Caribbeans onstage were produced, and the theatre's capability to entertain and to raise concerning questions were acknowledged.Banham, Hill, Woodyard, p. 148. George William Gordon acts as a representation for the lower class, alluding to the oppressions they were forced to endure throughout the play. The form of George William Gordon indicates that the scenes are meant to be performed in public. Therefore, the play not only represents the people, but also functions as a voice for the people so that their cries can be heard. The unfair court system, the low wages and their repercussions are stated clearly in the work by anonymous persons acting as a uniting voice for the people. It forms an identity for the Black underclass majority, which was Mais's ultimate goal in his work.

She was also the founder of the international broadcast cable television network Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) and the radio network WEWN. EWTN became a voice for Catholics worldwide. In 1981, Mother Angelica started broadcasting religious programs from a converted garage in Birmingham, Alabama. Over the next twenty years, she developed a media network that included radio, TV, and internet channels as well as printed media. Mother Angelica hosted shows on EWTN until she had a stroke in 2001. She continued to live in the cloistered monastery in Hanceville, Alabama, until her death at age 92 on March 27, 2016.  Early life  Mother Angelica was born Rita Antoinette Rizzo on April 20, 1923, in Canton, Ohio, in a community of African-American and Italian immigrant mill workers. Of Italian-American background, she was the only child of John and Mae Helen Rizzo (n√©e Gianfrancesco). Her father, a tailor by trade, abandoned the family when Rizzo was only five,Arroyo 6‚Äì7. and her parents divorced two years later. On March 10, 1931, her mother was granted custody of the young Rizzo, and her father ordered to pay five dollars a week in child support. Her mother only received \\"intermittent child-support payments from the father\\". While maintaining full custody, her mother struggled with chronic depression and poverty. This was in part because being a divorc√©e carried a social stigma at the time and the opportunities for a woman to secure income were limited especially in the height of the Great Depression.Arroyo 15. Looking back at her childhood, Mother Angelica described herself and her mother as being \\"like a pair of refugees\\". \\"We were poor, hungry, and barely surviving on odd jobs until Mother joined the dry cleaning business as an apprentice to a Jewish tailor in our area. Even then, we pinched pennies just to keep food on the table.\\" The pair lived with her maternal grandparents, moving out for a time between 1933 and 1937, but were forced to return because of financial pressures.Arroyo 15,19. Matters were complicated when her grandfather, Anthony Gianfrancesco, suffered a stroke in their absence, which paralyzed him on one side and required him to use a cane. =Education= Rizzo attended a convent school, but disliked the nuns there, whom she recalled as being \\"the meanest people on earth\\" and treating her with harsh discipline due to her parents' divorce.Mother Angelica: Obituaries ‚Äì Franciscan nun and media entrepreneur who founded the largest Catholic television network in the US [Eire Region] 2016, News International Trading Limited, London (UK). She then attended Canton McKinley High School, where she was one of the school's first drum majorettes. She later told an interviewer, \\"I did very poorly in school. I wasn‚Äôt interested in the capital of Ohio. I was interested in whether my mother had committed suicide that day.\\" Rizzo developed no intimate friendships in high school, partly because of her fear that it would further upset her mother, who saw other demands for attention as a threat. Rizzo never dated, recalling later, \\"I never had a date, never wanted one. I just didn't have any desire. I suppose having experienced the worst of married life, it was not at all attractive to me.\\". In 1939, Rizzo, feeling overwhelmed by crowd noise and school chatter, began to leave McKinley High in the afternoons. She was given calcium and nerve medication to treat what was deemed a nervous condition. When her mother's mental condition seemed to worsen, she made arrangements with her grandparents to have her sent to Philadelphia to be with a relative.Arroyo 20-21  Adulthood  A stomach ailment that Rizzo had from 1939 continued to cause severe abdominal pain, despite the extensive medical treatment she received. Her mother took her to Rhoda Wise who was hailed as a mystic and stigmatic and \\"who claimed to receive visions of St Th√©r√®se of Lisieux.\\" Wise instructed Rizzo to perform a novena (a nine-day course of prayers) and made the girl promise that she would spread devotion to the saint if she was cured. On the novena's final day, January 18, 1943, Rizzo declared that she woke up with no pain and the abdominal lump causing it had vanished. This experience profoundly touched her; she believed that God had performed a miracle and she traced her lifelong commitment to God to this event.Raymond Arroyo, Mother Angelica. Image, 2007. She later told an interviewer \\"[at that point] I knew that God knew me and loved me and was interested in me. All I wanted to do after my healing was give myself to Jesus.\\" One evening in 1944, Rizzo stopped at a church to pray and felt that God was calling her to be a nun. She sought guidance from a local parish priest who encouraged her to begin visiting convents. Her first visit was to the Sisters of St. Joseph in Buffalo, New York, but the active congregation felt that she was better suited to contemplative life. She also visited Saint Paul's Shrine of Perpetual Adoration, a facility operated by an order of cloistered contemplative nuns, located in Cleveland, Ohio. When visiting this order, she felt as if she were at home. The order accepted her as a postulant, inviting her to enter on August 15, 1944. She was 21 years old. On November 8, 1945, Rizzo was vested as a Poor Clare nun. She received a new name, which her mother had chosen for her, and title, \\"Sister Mary Angelica of the Annunciation\\". Soon afterwards, the Cleveland monastery established a new monastery in her home town of Canton and she moved there. In 1946, as a young nun, Sister Angelica had an accident with an industrial floor-scrubbing machine that knocked her over and injured her spine, causing her ongoing pain and requiring her to wear leg braces for most of her life. Sister Angelica saw the occurrence as a divine sign and promised Jesus to build a new monastery deep in the Protestant-dominated Southern United States if she recovered. On January 2, 1953, she made her solemn profession of vows at Sancta Clara Monastery in Ohio. = Our Lady of the Angels = While at Sancta Clara, Sister Angelica was inspired to create a religious community which would appeal to African Americans in the southern states and began to seek support. In 1957, Archbishop Thomas Toolen suggested that she open this community in Birmingham. With a number of other Poor Clare nuns she worked to raise the necessary funds, partially from a small business venture making and selling fishing lures. In 1961, the nuns bought a building and land, and in 1962, the community was officially established. It was named Our Lady of the Angels Monastery and located in Irondale, Alabama, although it was later relocated to the grounds of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament. = Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament = Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, Hanceville In 1999, Mother Angelica visited Colombia, where she claimed to have a vision which told her to build a temple in honor of the Child Jesus. Private donors contributed $48.6 million and she opened the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville later the same year. There is no indication if Mother Angelica submitted the alleged vision of Jesus to her bishop for discernment and approval before publishing it or received the bishop's permission to build a shrine, pursuant to Verbum Domini 14Verbum Domini on private revelation and Code of Canon Law, canon 1230.Code of Canon Law: Sacred Places = EWTN = In 1962, Mother Angelica began a series of community meetings on matters relevant to Catholicism and also began recording her talks for sale. Bishop Joseph Vath noticed her talent for communicating with the lay public and encouraged her to continue; she began taping a radio show for broadcast on Sunday mornings and published her first book in 1972. In the late 1970s she began videotaping her talks for television, which were broadcast on the satellite Christian Broadcasting Network. In 1981, after visiting a Chicago television studio and being impressed by its capability, she formed the non-profit EWTN corporation. Initially, she recorded her shows in a converted garage at the monastery's property. EWTN became a voice for American conservative and traditional Catholics, with its position on religious and social issues often mirroring that of Pope John Paul II. With the emphasis on tradition, Angelica had feuds with some members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Most famous is the feud over a pastoral letter written by Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over teachings surrounding the Eucharist and the liturgy. According to EWTN, the network's channels currently reach 264 million households globally. = WEWN = On December 28, 1992, Mother Angelica launched a radio network, WEWN, which is carried by 215 stations, as well as on shortwave.  Later years  On November 12, 1997, Mother Angelica, on her Mother Angelica Live show, called on the faithful under Cardinal Roger Mahony to disobey the cardinal's Guide for Sunday Mass, saying \\"I'm afraid my obedience in that diocese would be absolutely zero, and I hope everybody else's in that diocese is zero.\\"Los Angeles Times: Nun Apologizes for TV Criticism of Mahony On November 18, Mother Angelica apologized. Mother Angelica stepped down from control of EWTN in 2000 and handed control to a board of lay people. In 2001 she had one of several strokes.  Illness and death  Mother Angelica returned to taping her show twice a week on September 25, 2001. On Christmas Eve, she suffered another stroke and underwent a thrombectomy to remove a blood clot, a procedure that resulted in improvement of her vision. The stroke caused partial paralysis of the right side of her body and affected her speech. She began speech therapy and stopped hosting television programs. As her health declined, fellow sisters of her order in Hanceville began providing her with constant care. On October 4, 2009, Mother Angelica and Deacon Bill Steltemeier, then chairman of EWTN's board of governors, received the papal medal (Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice) from Pope Benedict XVI for their distinguished service to the Catholic Church. Because of her ill health, Mother Angelica received the award in her room. Bishop Robert J. Baker of the Diocese of Birmingham said: \\"Mother Angelica‚Äôs effort has been at the vanguard of the new evangelization and has had a great impact on our world.\\" In early December 2015, Mother Angelica was placed on a feeding tube. A representative for her order explained, \\"It's not that she's completely unable to eat. It's assisting her to get the nutrients she needs.\\" He added that she had experienced \\"some up and downs the last few months. She's a fighter.\\" Although confined to her bed, a representative said that \\"She's able to communicate with a squeeze of a hand, make gestures with her eyes. She acknowledges people when they're there. The nuns say she does sleep a lot.\\" The use of a feeding tube was in accord with the wishes she made before her stroke in 2001 ‚Äì a reporter recalled her saying: \\"We don't understand the awesomeness of living even one more day... I told my sisters the other day, 'When I get really bad give me all the medicine I can take, all the tubes you can stuff down me. ... I want to live. ... Because I will have suffered one more day for the love of God ... I will exercise you in virtue. But most of all I will know God better. You cannot measure the value of one new thought about God in your own life.'\\" In early February 2016 Pope Francis, while en route to Cuba, recorded a message for Mother Angelica, saying: \\"To Mother Angelica with my blessing and I ask you to pray for me; I need it. God bless you Mother Angelica.\\" Near the end of that month, her fellow nuns at Our Lady of Angels Monastery called for prayers on her behalf saying that \\"Mother's condition remains delicate and she receives devoted care day and night by her sisters and nurses. In God's Providence, she was able to receive the special Jubilee grace of passing through the Holy Door shortly after its opening. Although she is most often sleeping, from time to time Mother will give a radiant smile. ... Please continue to keep her in your prayers; each day is a gift!\\" Mother Angelica remained living at the monastery until her death on March 27, 2016 (Easter Sunday) at the age of 92 from complications due to the stroke she had 14 years prior. At the time, she \\"also suffered from Bell's palsy, heart disease and asthma.\\" Mother Angelica held the Catholic belief in Redemptive suffering, the belief human suffering can become meritorious if offered to Jesus Christ and mystically united with His suffering. Because of this belief, in her period of declining health Mother Angelica \\"instructed her nuns to do everything to keep her alive, no matter how much she suffered, because every day she suffered, she suffered for God.\\" EWTN chaplain, Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, MFVA told reporters that Mother Angelica's desire to unite with Jesus in suffering was fulfilled when she \\"went into her death throes on Good Friday\\". Father Wolfe recalled that \\"Mother began to cry out early in the morning from the pain that she was having. She had a fracture in her bones because of the length of time she had been bedridden. They said you could hear it down the hallways, that she was crying out on Good Friday from what she was going through. These two people [a caregiver and one of the sisters of her order] said to me she has excruciating pain.\\" Wolfe said that \\"After the 3 o'clock hour arrived on Good Friday she was more calm, she was more peaceful.\\" By 5:30 am on Easter Sunday, Wolfe was contacted by Mother Delores who told him that Mother Angelica \\"was really struggling, she wasn't doing very well.\\" Wolfe went to her bedside to administer the Catholic last rites with the sisters of her order in attendance. The sisters prayed their morning prayers, the Divine Office, around her bed. As it was Easter, the prayer was liturgically required to contain Alleluias, which are usually not contained in the office for the dead ‚Äì a fact that Wolfe felt had significance. Around 10:30 am, Father Paschal offered Mass in her room and she received her last communion (Viaticum). She took her last breath shortly before 5:00 pm, and died. = Tributes = In a statement on EWTN's Facebook page, Father Sean O. Sheridan, president of the Franciscan University of Steubenville where Mother Angelica received an honorary doctorate of sacred theology, described her as \\"a true media giant. She proved that the Church belonged in the popular media alongside the news, sports, and talk shows. Though her stances were decidedly old-school ‚Äî she was critical of religious and political progressives ‚Äî her lectures were lightened with an often self-deprecating humor. She famously said the nuns she remembered from her youth were \\"the meanest people on God‚Äôs earth.\\" In a ceremony on March 29, 2016, Mother Angelica's body was brought to the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery for private visitation by the Poor Clare nuns. Public visitation occurred at the upper church of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament on March 30‚Äì31. The Mass of Christian Burial at the shrine's upper church took place on April 1 with Archbishop of Philadelphia and EWTN board member Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., serving as principal celebrant and EWTN chaplain Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, MFVA, as the homilist. Robert J. Baker and David E. Foley, the current and emeritus Bishops of Birmingham (where both EWTN and Our Lady of the Angels Monastery are located), respectively, concelebrated the Mass, along with Archbishop Thomas J. Rodi of Mobile (whose ecclesiastical province includes the Diocese of Birmingham), Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of Phoenix, Bishop Richard F. Stika of Knoxville and Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. In addition, many priests, deacons, religious, and seminarians were in attendance. This was followed by the Rite of Committal at the shrine's crypt chapel. All the funeral rites were televised on EWTN.

Tengen and Sega released the English version of the game overseas in 1993. It is the last game in the Aleste series, and is a followup to MUSHA for the Sega Genesis. Gameplay Robo Aleste follows the traditional vertically scrolling shooter style, with the player flying forward and enemies coming from the front, sides, and rear. At the end of each level is a boss, which the player must defeat in order to move on. Each boss is one of the enemy warlords. Like most scrolling shooters, there are several weapons which can be collected and powered up. The main kunai shot and the three subweapons from Musha Aleste return, joined by new power levels for the main shot and a new subweapon. The sideship system has been completely redesigned: the player now has two indestructible units with him/her at all times, which also fire his/her subweapons themselves. The ability to give the sideships commands has been replaced with a new subweapon that hits in many different directions. Additionally, the sideships can be launched at enemies. The Aleste initially starts out with nothing but the main shot and these sideships, and will return to this state whenever the player loses a life. To powerup the main weapon, the player must collect small power chips dropped from a certain type of friendly ship. As more chips are collected, the number of knives in a shot increases (up to four), and eventually the Aleste can start firing stronger fireballs instead. The other weapons are subweapons that each have a particular ability and function separately from the main weapon; only one subweapon can be equipped at a time. To collect, switch between, and powerup subweapons, the player must collect one of four colored spheres dropped by another type of friendly ship. Each subweapon has four levels of power, growing stronger and more destructive with each increase in level, obtained by collecting the same subweapon again and again. The four subweapons are as follows: *The red Bakuryu-housen-ka, or Exploding Flower, releases a large barrage of bomblets, which explode upon impact with the ground or an enemy. Useful for quickly clearing the entire forward screen of foes, as the explosion persists for a short time after impact. This weapon returns from Musha. *The yellow Hiei-meppu-jin, or Flying Shadow Formation, causes the options that normally fly in front of the craft to circle the Aleste with a protective shield. The options will also actively attack any nearby enemies. It is highly useful for when enemy craft are coming in from the rear of the screen, and the options can still block bullets in this mode. This weapon returns from Musha, where it was blue. *The blue Raisen-ha, or Lightning Flash, fires a large blue bolt of electricity at the player's foes. Useful for large enemies (such as bosses) or for when many foes are flying in from the front of the screen, as it deals great damage but with poor horizontal range. This weapon returns from Musha, where it was yellow. *The green Fuusha- shuriken, or Windmill Throwing-Knife, fires large shuriken in either four or eight different directions, depending on the weapon's powerup level. The stars are flaming at higher levels. Useful for when many enemies are coming in from the front and sides. This weapon is new to Dennin, and as mentioned replaces the ability to give the sideships commands. Plot The plot of the game refers to the Sengoku era feudal Japan being given giant mecha. The player takes control of one such mecha, the Aleste, piloted by a man named Kagerou, as he fights other feudal lords. Kagerou (Shadow) is the sole surviving member of Oda \\"Demon King\\" Nobunaga's robot ninja army, the White Fang. The Aleste is an 8-metre tall mechanized steam-powered mech. At the start of the game, Nobunaga's home is razed to the ground by Kurogane, who is a frequent end-of- level boss throughout the game and the older brother of Kagerou. Nobunaga survives, Kagerou defeats Kurogane and resumes his mission to bring down the anti-Oda alliance. Kurogane is humiliated and refuses to believe that he was defeated by his younger brother Kagerou through skill alone, so he builds himself a gigantic mecha to match the power of the Aleste. He then tests the machine's firepower on a defenseless village, killing all of the innocent villagers caught in the onslaught. Kagerou eventually learns of this and fights Kurogane in a battle to the death. The Aleste, in the end, wins and Kurogane dies. Kagerou continues his mission and after defeating all of the opposing warlords he comes face-to-face with Astaroth, the leader of the anti- Oda alliance. After defeating Astaroth, Kagerou learns that she has come from another dimension which was supposedly destroyed by Nobunaga, who she believes to be the resurrected figure of Lucifer. Nobunaga plans to take over the world and Kagerou eventually uses the Aleste to stop him once and for all, trapping him in Honn≈ç-ji.  Release  The game was released on November 27, 1993 in Japan for the Mega Drive CD. It was released in North America and Europe in 1993. Reception Upon release, Weekly Famitsu gave it a score of 24 out of 40. Retro Gamer included Robo Aleste on their list of top ten games for the Mega CD, commenting that \\"the music and cut-scenes genuinely elevate the game to a new level of greatness.\\" Hardcore Gaming 101 opined \\"the CD medium doesn't add much to the game other than some OK music and some nice scaling effects here and there.

He is best known for his film debut as David Axelrod in Franco Zeffirelli's Endless Love (1981). His last role was a 2003 episode of ER. Early life and education Martin Hewitt was born on February 19, 1958 in San Jose, California.Martin Hewitt biography at The New York Times He is the second oldest of six children to Peter and Heather Hewitt. Peter Hewitt is a retired owner of a medical-equipment manufacturing firm. Hewitt's early years were spent in California, England, Belgium, and Michigan. Hewitt attended Claremont High School. Hewitt first acted at age 14 in a school production of The King and I. He studied business at a community college before switching to theater. After receiving an AA degree in Theater Arts, Hewitt studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, in Pasadena, California. Career =Endless Love= While enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, CA and working as bartender and valet car park/parking lot attendant, Hewitt saw an ad for an open call for a film directed by Franco Zeffirelli and beat out 5,000 actors, including Tom Cruise and Timothy Hutton, for the male lead. Hewitt had originally envisioned a Shakespearean career, but suddenly he was starring opposite Brooke Shields in Franco Zeffirelli's Endless Love, a 1981 forbidden teen romance film. According to Hewitt, \\"Some people actually wrote that I was discovered in a parking lot.\\" \\"Of course, my head swelled up like crazy,\\" he says. \\"Franco, who is very paternal, fed my ego so that I would be very confident.\\" Hewitt spoke highly of his co-star, Brooke Shields. \\"She treated me like a friend,\\" he says. During filming in New York City, she invited Hewitt to spend the weekend at her house in New Jersey, where they played board games. Hewitt garnered mostly neutral reviews for his portrayal of David Axelrod. Variety commented that \\"Since he‚Äôs center stage most of the time, it‚Äôs fortunate that newcomer Martin Hewitt registers so strongly. Zeffirelli has dressed and photographed his find almost in the style of some of his mentor Luchino Visconti‚Äôs neo-realist heroes, with two-day beard growths and anachronistic Clark Gable undershirts.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Hewitt \\"has neither the resources nor the opportunity to convey much about how David's mind works, even though this is what the story hinges on.\\" Nevertheless, Hewitt said, \\"I don't care what anyone says; I am proud of that film.\\" =Later acting career= \\"I started at the top. My first professional acting role was in a starring role in a Universal Studios film,\\" he said. \\"I didn't even get the chance to get my feet wet. So after that film, it was sort of a downward path.\\" After appearing in his second film, Yellowbeard (1983), in which he portrayed the son of Graham Chapman's character, Hewitt spent the 1980s shooting forgettable B movies and doing the occasional TV guest spot. Of the films he appeared in during the '80s included: April Fool, later to be titled Killer Party (1986); The Falling (1987); and Two Moon Junction (1988). Hollywood.com In the latter film, he portrayed Chad, the fiance of Sherilyn Fenn's character. Hewitt previously worked with Fenn in Out Of Control (1985). Hewitt had also done straight-to- video flicks including Crime Lords (1991), Carnal Crimes (1991) and Night Rhythms (1992). He eventually left show business. \\"I was kind of surprised that I didn't hear his name much after that,\\" says Yellowbeard director Melvin Damski. \\"He was a talented kid.\\" =Life after acting= Branching out into home inspection to help pay the bills, he opened his own company in 1993. \\"Any time my agent would call and say, 'We want you to read for this,' \\" he says, \\"I'd go, 'Man, I've got an inspection.'\\"As of 2015, Hewitt still owns his home inspection service in San Luis Obispo, California. \\"I really don't miss it,\\" he says of his brief Hollywood heyday. \\"I've got my own company. I live in a great area. I have great kids. I surf every other day. I've got it all as far as I'm concerned.\\" Still, he hasn't quite shaken the acting bug. According to People, Hewitt learned of an industry ad asking if anyone knew where he was. Some filmmakers, it turned out, thought he would be perfect for a lead role in a movie about drugged-out gay prostitutes in West Hollywood. \\"It wasn't for me\\", he says with a laugh. \\"I politely declined.\\" Personal life Hewitt has confirmed that he and Shields were never romantically involved in real life, stating that they \\"became good friends, but we're not close.\\" Shields later vouched for this in her 2014 memoir, There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me. \\"Martin and I got along well and enjoyed working with one another. We neither fell in love nor hated each other...All we were required to do was convince people we were in love. This approach freed us both up to become actual friends.\\" While Hewitt was filming Crime Lords in South Africa in 1989, he met German-born flight attendant Kerstin Gneiting, whom he married in 1990. They divorced in 2015. Their two children are daughter Guinevere and son Cailean. Hewitt currently resides in Morro Bay, California.

A marching ceremony, known as the \\"Silly Walk ceremony\\", is conducted each evening along with the flag ceremony. The ceremony started in 1986 as an agreement of peace, although there was not a conflict at that time. Other Middle Eastern nations have adapted similar ceremonies in recent years.

It is a small pagoda () built on the top of a granite boulder covered with gold leaves pasted on by its male devotees. According to legend, the Golden Rock itself is precariously perched on a strand of the Buddha's hair. The balancing rock seems to defy gravity, as it perpetually appears to be on the verge of rolling down the hill. The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. Another legend states that a Buddhist priest impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial king used his supernatural powers to carry the rock to its current place, specifically choosing the rock for its resemblance to the monk's head. It is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni Pagoda. Currently, women are not allowed into the inner sanctuary of the rocks vicinity, maintained by an employed security guard who watches over the gated entrance. Women are permitted in the outer balcony and the lower courtyard of the rock. Etymology In the Mon language, the word 'kyaik' () means \\"pagoda\\" and 'yo' () means \\"to carry on the hermit's head\\". The word 'ithi' ( in Mon (from Pali , risi) means \\"hermit\\". Thus, 'Kyaik-htiyo' means \\"pagoda upon a hermit's head\\". Legend The legend associated with the pagoda is that the Buddha, on one of his many visits, gave a strand of his hair to Taik Tha, a hermit. The hermit, who had tucked it in the tuft of his hair safely, in turn gave the strand to the king, with the wish that the hair be enshrined in a boulder shaped like the hermit's head. The king had inherited supernatural powers from his father Zawgyi, a proficient alchemist), and his mother, a naga serpent dragon princess. They found the rock at the bottom of the sea. With the help of the Thagyamin, the king of Tawadeintha Heaven in Buddhist cosmology, found the perfect place at Kyaiktiyo for locating the golden rock and built a pagoda, where the strand was enshrined. It is this strand of hair that, according to the legend, prevents the rock from tumbling down the hill. The boat, which was used to transport the rock, turned into a stone. This is also worshiped by pilgrims at a location about from the golden rock. It is known as the Kyaukthanban Pagoda or stupa (literal meaning: stone boat stupa). Legends also mention that pilgrims undertaking the pilgrimage by trekking from the Kinpun base camp three times consecutively in a year will be blessed with wealth and recognition. Geography The pagoda is located near Kyaikto in Mon State in the northern part of the Tenasserim coast. The Golden Rock is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level, on top of the Kyaiktiyo hill (also known as Kelasa hills or Eastern Yoma mountains); it is on the Paung-laung ridge of the Eastern Yoma mountains. It is at a distance of from Yangon and 140 kilometers (86 mi) north of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. The Kinpun village 16 km (10 mi) is at the base of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It is the closest to the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. From Kyaiktiyo, the foot trail or road starts for the Golden rock. On this approach, there are numerous granite boulders on the mountain, perched in precarious condition. Near the top of the mountain, there are two large lions guarding the entrance to Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. From this location, known as Yatetaung (the last point for vehicular traffic), pilgrims and visitors have to climb to the Golden Rock barefoot, after leaving their footwear behind, as per Burmese custom. The paved mountain track, built in 1999, from the bus terminal at Yatetaung, is along a dusty section with kiosks on both sides and the climb of 1.2 km up to the Golden Rock is stiff and takes about one hour to reach. From the base camp at Kinpun, the hiking trek to the pagoda is about and many devotees do this trek as part of the pilgrimage rites. There are also many temples and pagodas, which have been built recently on other hills in the vicinity of the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda that are visited by pilgrims and tourists by trekking along foot tracks. Structures The boulder, which gleams golden and is popularly known as the Golden Rock, and on which the small Kyaiktiyo Pagoda has been built, is about in height and has a circumference of . The Pagoda above the rock is about in height. The boulder sits on a natural rock platform that appears to have been naturally formed to act as the base to build the pagoda. This granite boulder lies on an inclined plane and the area of contact is extremely small. The golden rock or boulder and the rock table on which it is resting are independent of each other; the golden rock has an overhang of half its length and is perched at the extreme end of the sloping surface of the rock. There is a sheer vertical drop in the rock face, into the valley below. A lotus shape is painted in gold leaf, encircling the base of the rock. It appears as though the boulder will crash down at any moment. A staircase leads to the pagoda complex that houses several viewing platforms, pagodas, Buddha shrines, and nats (spirits worshipped in Burma in conjunction with Buddhism shrines). However, the Golden Rock is the main attraction for the pilgrims who offer prayers and also stick golden leaves on the rock in reverence. A short distance away, there is a circle of gongs with four statues of nats and angels in the centre. A main square close to the golden rock has many establishments that deal in religious paraphernalia for worship and offerings made by the pilgrims. Adjoining the plaza area is the Potemkin village where restaurants, gift shops, and guest houses are located. A new terrace has been built at a lower level from which visitors can get a good view of the rock and the pagoda. Pilgrimage Kyaiktiyo Pagoda or Golden Rock has become a popular pilgrimage and also tourist attraction. At the peak of the pilgrimage season, during November to March, an atmosphere of devotion is witnessed at Kyaikhtiyo pagoda. As the golden rock gleams in different shades from dawn to dusk (the sight at dawn and at sunset are unique), pilgrims' chants reverberate in the precincts of the shrine. Lighting of candles, meditation and offerings to the Buddha continues throughout the night. Men cross over a bridge across an abyss to affix golden leaves (square in shape) on the face of the Golden Rock, in deep veneration. However, women are not allowed to touch the rock so cannot cross the bridge. Pilgrims visit the pagoda, from all regions of Myanmar; a few foreign tourists also visit the pagoda. Even disabled persons who are staunch devotees of Buddha visit the pagoda, walking up the track on crutches. Old people, who can not climb, are carried on stretchers by porters to the Pagoda to offer prayers to Buddha.Reid p.150 The Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, is a special occasion for pilgrims who visit the shrine. On this day, the platform of the pagoda is lighted with ninety thousand candles as reverential offering to the Lord Buddha. The devotees visiting the pagoda also offer fruits, food and incense to the Buddha. Currently, women are not allowed into the inner sanctuary of the rocks vicinity, maintained by an employed security guard who watches over the gated entrance. Women are permitted in the outer balcony and the lower courtyard of the rock. The belief stems from the practice of women forbidden to make physical contact with male monks, who are vowed under chastity as the rock itself represents of the Buddhist monk resembling its head.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. The revolt was in reaction to the increase in taxation to raise funds for defense of the region against the British, a rise in the price of tobacco and brandy, which were part of the late eighteenth-century Bourbon reforms.Mark A. Burkholder and Lyman L. Johnson, Colonial Latin America 7th edition. New York: Oxford University Press 2010, p. 351. The initial revolt was local and not well known outside the region of Socorro, but in the late nineteenth century, historian Manuel Brice√±o saw the massive revolt as a precursor to independence.Stoller, \\"Comunero Revolt\\", p. 240. Prior to the 1781 revolt, residents in New Granada had protested, at times violently, crown policy implementation there between 1740 and 1779. The revolt On March 16, 1781, in Socorro in northeastern Colombia, grocer Manuela Beltr√°n tore down posted edicts about new tax increases and other changes that would have reduced the profits of the colonists and enlarged the benefits of Spain. Many other towns in New Granada began to have the same occurrences with colonists livid about the conditions of the ruling government. Local residents began to assemble and elect a body of officials known as el com√∫n, or a central committee \\"to lead the movement.\\"Young, Ronald. \\"Comuneros' Revolt in New Granada.‚Äù Modern World History Online. Facts on File , 2008. Accessed 29 January 2010. The rebels unified under the leadership of Juan Francisco Berbeo, a Criollo elite. Despite coming from the upper classes of society, the rebels introduced the idea of unifying and organising the diverse social classes comprising common people; the endorsement of the elites improved the rebels' efforts to unify, where Berbeo consolidated 10,000 to 20,000 rebel troops to march on Bogot√°, the capital. Once the rebels defeated the rival soldiers sent from Bogot√°, they reached a town slightly north of it, where Spanish officials agreed to meet with the Comuneros and sign an agreement stating the conditions and complaints of the rebels.Phillip, Charles, and Alan Axelrold. ‚ÄúComunero's Revolt in New Granada.‚Äù Modern World History Online. Facts on File, 2005. Accessed 29 January 2010. However, once the rebels disbanded, the Spanish government officials signed a document that discarded the agreement on the basis that it was forced upon them. Once reinforcements for the Spanish government arrived, they were sent to rebellious cities and towns to enforce the implementation of the increased taxes. Jos√© Antonio Gal√°n, one of the leaders of the revolt, continued on with a small number of rebels, including Jose Manuel Ortiz Manosalvas, but they were quickly defeated and executed, while other leaders of the rebellion were sentenced for life in prison for treason. The influence of the revolt led to similar uprisings, with a similar outcome, as far north as M√©rida and Timotes, now in Venezuela but at the time under jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.See Mu√±oz Ora√°, Los comuneros de Venezuela. The city of Barinas defeated the Comuneros of the Venezuelan Andes (1781), a fact that led to King Carlos IV granting it in 1790 the coat of arms that today retains the state capital, along with the motto \\"very noble and very loyal\\". Interpretations of its causes Many causes contributed to the revolt of 1781. Some were long-standing, related to the viceroyalty in New Granada in 1717. There is a debate among historians over what the main factor was, but what is clear is that the need for economic and political reform and the idea of self-government were contributors. A series of reforms to the economy and government of the colonies, now called the Bourbon Reforms, are believed to be a factor. As the growth of the population and economy of the New World began to outgrow that of Spain, Spain began to look for ways to make the colonies more profitable. The Spanish government sought to eliminate tax evasion to reduce benefits of the colonies and created new laws and taxes to establish greater support and a larger revenue for the home country. Spain also created trading companies, allowed for agricultural and industrial \\"royal monopolies\\" and encouraged a greater amount of imports to the colonies to decrease the manufacturing capability of the colonies. These economic and social reforms increased the limitations for colonists to produce crops and changed their economy.‚ÄúBourdon Reforms.‚Äù World History: The Modern Era. ABC-CLIO, n.d. Accessed 29 January 2010. Another factor considered by scholars is the major political reforms that the Spanish government forced on the colonies. In order for Spain to benefit economically from the colonies, it needed stricter control over their government. These political changes were also part of the Bourbon Reforms. Some historians such as Brian Hamnett believe that it was the age-long battle between \\"absolutism versus the unwritten constitution\\" of New Granada that spurred on the colonists. He believes that the imperialism of the Spanish home country and its dependence upon the colonies contributed for the need of the colonies' \\"decentralization.\\" In a review of John Leddy Phelan's book on the Comunero revolt,John Leddy Phelan, The people and the King : the Comunero Revolution in Colombia, 1781. Madison : University of Wisconsin Press, 1978. Hamnett states that the revolt was started, not with the goal of an independence movement, political freedom and self-government, but only with the hope of reversing the reforms.Brian R. Hamnett, (1980). \\"Review of The People and the King: The Comunero Revolt in Colombia, 1781 by John Leddy Phelen\\". The Americas. 36 (3): 415‚Äì416.

Later as he studied Earth history and evolution, he called himself a ‚Äúgeologian.‚Äù He rejected the label ‚Äútheologian‚Äù or ‚Äúecotheologian‚Äù as too narrow and not descriptive of his cultural studies in history of religions. He was drawn early on to respond to the growing ecological and climate crisis and proposed the need for a \\"New Story\\" of evolution in 1978. In this essay he suggested that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. Berry believed that humanity, after generations spent in despoiling the planet, is poised to embrace a new role as a vital part of a larger, interdependent Earth community, consisting of a ‚Äúcommunion of subjects not a collection of objects.‚Äù He felt that we were at a critical turning point, moving out of the Cenozoic era and entering into a new evolutionary phase, which would either be an Ecozoic Era, characterized by mutually-enhancing human-Earth relations, or a Techozoic Era, where we dominate and exploit the planet via our technological mastery. Berry said the transformation of humanity‚Äôs priorities will not come easily. It requires what he called ‚Äúthe great work‚Äù ‚Äî the title of one of his books ‚Äî in four institutional realms: the political and legal order; the economic and industrial world; education; and religion.REVKIN, ANDREW C.

Biography Born to William and Bess Berry in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1914, Berry was the third of 13 children. His father founded Berico Fuels in 1924. At age 11 he had an epiphany in a meadow, which became a primary reference point for the rest of his life.Thomas Berry, ‚ÄúMeadow Across the Creek,‚Äù The Great Work (Bell Tower, 1999). He later elaborated this experience into a set of ‚ÄúTwelve Principles for Understanding the Universe‚Äù, which became the basis for his contributions to Earth Jurisprudence.Thomas Berry, Evening Thoughts: Reflecting on Earth as Sacred Community, edited by Mary Evelyn Tucker (Sierra Club, 2006), 145-147. These principles are based on this perspective: > ‚ÄúThe universe, the solar system, and planet Earth in themselves and in their > evolutionary emergence constitute for the human community the primary > revelation of that ultimate mystery whence all things emerge into > being.‚ÄùLonergan, Anne; Richards, Caroline (1987). Thomas Berry and the New > Cosmology. Twenty-Third Publications. p. 112. . Berry entered a monastery of the Passionist order in 1933, where he adopted the name \\"Thomas,\\" after Thomas Aquinas. He was ordained a priest in 1942. He began studying cultural history, especially the world's religions. He received his doctorate in history from The Catholic University of America, with a thesis on Giambattista Vico's philosophy of history. He then studied Chinese language and Chinese culture in China and learned Sanskrit for the study of Hinduism. He published a book on the Religions of India and one on Buddhism. He taught Asian religions at universities in New Jersey and New York (1956‚Äì1965). He then became the founder and director of the graduate program in the History of Religions at Fordham University (1966‚Äì1979). There he directed over twenty doctoral dissertations. During this period he also founded and directed the Riverdale Center of Religious Research in Riverdale, New York (1970‚Äì1995). In addition to Asian religions, he studied and taught classes on Native American cultures and shamanism. He assisted in an educational program for the T'boli tribal peoples of South Cotabato, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, From his academic beginnings as a historian of world cultures and religions, Berry developed into a historian of the Earth and its evolutionary processes. He was influenced by the work of the Jesuit scientist, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and he served as president of the American Teilhard Association (1975‚Äì1987). Berry took Teilhard‚Äôs major ideas on evolution and expanded them into an epic story to which we belong. To that end with the cosmologist Brian Swimme he wrote The Universe Story (1992). The multimedia project Journey of the Universe (2011) was also inspired by this perspective. This is a film (dedicated to Berry), a book, a series of Conversations on DVDs and podcasts, and online courses from Yale/Coursera. In 1995, Berry returned to Greensboro, North Carolina. While nominally retired, he continued to write, lecture, and receive friends at his home. In a tribute to Berry, Mary Evelyn Tucker says that his books ‚Äì The Dream of the Earth (1988 reprinted, 2006), The Universe Story (with Brian Swimme, 1992), and The Great Work: Our Way into the Future (1999) ‚Äì are \\"major contributions to discussions on the environment\\". A collection of his essays, Evening Thoughts: Reflecting on Earth as Sacred Community (2006), was jointly published by Sierra Club Books and the University of California Press. He completed two final books of essays in 2009, The Sacred Universe and The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth. His work continues with the Thomas Berry Foundation, the American Teilhard Association, the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, and the Journey of the Universe project.Rushing, Denise (2011). Tending the Soul's Garden: Permaculture as a Way Forward in Difficult Times. Lake County, CA, USA: Dancing TreePeople Publications. . In 2014, the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology hosted a conference at Yale University titled \\"Living Cosmology: Christian Responses to Journey of the Universe\\" to honor Berry's 100th birthday. An online course \\"The Worldview of Thomas Berry: The Flourishing of the Earth Community\\" is available through Yale/ Coursera and is hosted by Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim of Yale University. In 2019 Thomas Berry: A Biography was published by Columbia University Press written by Tucker, Grim, and Angyal.

Berry also contributed two introductory essays ('Economics: Its Effects on the Life Systems of the World' and 'The Earth: A New Context for Religious Unity') to the volume Thomas Berry and the New Cosmology, in which Brian Swimme, Caroline Richards, Gregory Baum and others discuss the implications of Berry's thought for a range of disciplines and paradigms.

It had a mixed schedule of news and light entertainment, with the emphasis on events in the GDR, and also included regional programming. History Radio DDR 1 was established in August 1953 when, as part of a reorganization of the broadcasting system, it joined the existing stations Deutschlandsender (part of Rundfunk der DDR since 1949) and Berliner Rundfunk (founded in 1946). Between June 1954 and September 1955, it was known as Berlin zweites Programm (Berlin 2nd Programme) in distinction from Berlin erstes Programm (Berlin 1st Programme), the new name for Berliner Rundfunk. The channel, which was transmitted on medium wave (531, 558, 576, 603, 729, 882, and 1044 kHz) and FM, broadcast until 1990. In April of that year it was renamed \\"Radio aktuell\\" and carried advertising for the first time. Following German reunification, Radio aktuell's frequencies were transferred to the new public-service broadcasting organizations Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (covering Saxony, Saxony- Anhalt, and Thuringia) and Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg, and to the Hamburg-based Norddeutscher Rundfunk which took over as public-service broadcaster in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Programmes The weekly Schlagerrevue, which ran for 36 years and was presented from 1958 by Heinz Quermann, became the world's longest-running radio hit parade. The programme's editor from 1963 to 1988 was the composer, lyricist, arranger, singer, and bandleader Siegfried Jordan. Radio DDR 1's Sports Department employed such well known journalists as Heinz-Florian Oertel, Hubert Knobloch, Wolfgang Hempel, and Waldefried Forkefeld.

His practice has included found object-sculptures, performance installations, drawings and most recently paintings with sculptural elements. Frank lives and works in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia.  Early life  Frank was born in Singleton, in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia. At the age of 19 he moved overseas to pursue a career as an artist in Europe and the United States. In 1998 he returned to live in Australia permanently.  Work  Frank's artistic explorations in the mid 70s consisted of abstracted landscapes and assemblages that contained materials such as hardwoods and furniture. Later his performance based sculptures included: staging an elaborate lighting and sound disco together with a DJ at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney, and the Canberra Contemporary Art Centre; and installing eight large professional pool tables and associated paraphernalia of a Pool Hall, at the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane. At the Hotel Art Fair in 1996 Frank was given a luxury suite, where he installed hired four transgender \\"hostess‚Äôs\\" to serve Swiss Chocolates and Champagne throughout the Fair with the room sculpture becoming the focal point of the Fair. Other sculptures include having himself hypnotised before attending an empty exhibition opening with certain code words prompting certain responses from the artist. Sculpture installations include in 1994, at the Australian National Gallery, in Canberra, installing high performance miniature speakers, that played out across the entry forecourt a continuous repeat of 5 David Bowie albums, Diamond Dogs, Pin Ups, Aladin Sain, Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust, creating the feeling of a daytime disco for those approaching. Another sculpture, at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, 1996, consisted of the gallery strewn with filled ash trays and all the detritus of a wild party, as if it had been held the night before. From 1981 - 1994 Frank created surreal large-scale drawings. Composed of intense tightly held lines they were up to 320 x 720 cm in size. They were exhibited worldwide, including New York (Willard Gallery), Amsterdam (Museum Stedelijk Fodor) and the Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney Biennale 1982). Around 1995 Frank employed varnish as the sole material of his paintings and developed signature his 'monochromes'. Although not the main development of his work at the time, this practice by 2002 saw the introduction of colour and the rapid experimentation of chemical, time and motion studies within the paintings. This distinct technique of layering thick varnish to create abstract hypnotic paintings, resulted in compositions that hint at the psychedelic, and are notable for their vibrant and distinctive use of colour. Although the foundation of this process is not unique to Frank, he has developed and refined his technique over his 35-year career to create a personal sensibility and aesthetic. Australian curator and writer Stuart Koop wrote: 'Since 2001 I'd suggest, Frank's paintings don't depict, or represent anything. Rather in a scientific sense they illustrate the behaviour of different painting materials, in isolation or in combination with others'. The titles of his paintings are phrases invented or overheard that 'read like short stories' such as To Cool To Matter, and His Common Law ex wife moved to Port Fairy and Went on the Game, adding ambiguity and psychology to the works. Koop writes: 'The works' titles remind us of Frank's creative intercession in these chemical exchanges: snippets from life conversations, things read, influences at large, big and little ideas that might suggest a subject, but perhaps better reflect the life of the artist in parallel - forming a montage whose doubtful inherent logic might still truly reflect the chaotic complexity of influence.' Australian art critic Andrew Frost stated: 'Dale Frank's work is out there, all on its own, largely untroubled by recent theory or passing fashion. It stands alone, majestic and strange.' However, his current works in particular ascribe to the 'expanded notion' theory of painting: sculpture, and performance could be considered in as part of the painting medium. Frank's 2015 exhibition at Neon Parc, Melbourne demonstrated this. The show included found objects turned sculpture such as Bust, a white chocolate fountain, whose abject nature and painterly chocolate flow correlated with the accompanying paintings Dale has shifted from working on canvas to Perspex in his current practice, which he states has added a new dimension to the work both 'spatially and conceptually'. The reflective nature of Perspex alters the paint quality, and in addition the work becomes a 'performance' activated and completed when the viewer stands before it. In 2014 Dale Frank donated 85 works valued at $4 million AUD to the National Gallery of Canberra, which they stated was the most significant gift by a living artist since Arthur Boyd Gift in 1975. Gallery director Ron Radford described Franks as 'one of Australia's most important painters'.  Exhibitions  Frank's exhibition history comprises Australian and international exhibitions. It includes inclusion in the Venice Biennale, in the Aperto section in 1984 and in the collateral exhibition Personal Structures in 2013. In 2010 he participated in the 17th Biennale of Sydney: The Beauty of Distance, Songs of Survival in a Precarious Age. Solo museum exhibitions include a survey show in 2000 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney, Dale Frank: Ecstasy ‚Äì 20 Years of Painting. He has held numerous exhibitions at commercial galleries including Roslyn Oxley9, Anna Schwartz, Gow Langsford and Neon Parc. A monograph So Far: the Art of Dale Frank 2005-1980 (Schwartz Publishing) was published in 2007 and follows the publication of his earlier monograph Dale Frank (Craftsman House, 1992).  Recognition  Frank was awarded the 2005 Arthur Guy Memorial Painting Prize from the Bendigo Art Gallery, worth $50,000.

The Revolt of the Comuneros () was a series of uprisings by settlers in Paraguay in the Viceroyalty of Peru against the Spanish authorities from 1721‚Äì1725 and 1730‚Äì1735. The underlying cause of the unrest was strong anti- Jesuit feelings among the Paraguayans and dislike for any governor seen as favoring the Jesuits. In the resumption of the revolt in 1730, economic issues came to fore as well. The rebel organization split in its second phase, as the rural poor and the urban elite each formed their own factions with similar grievances against the Jesuits, but incompatible politics. Paraguay had an unusually strong tradition of self-rule; the colonists did not have a tradition of strict obedience to everything the Spanish Crown's governor decreed. This independence helped push the revolt forward. The beginnings of the revolt were quasi-legal at first. Jos√© de Antequera y Castro (1690‚Äì1731), a judge for the Real Audiencia of Charcas, was sent to Asunci√≥n in 1721 to examine charges of misconduct against pro-Jesuit Governor Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda. Antequera concluded the charges were valid, forced Reyes into exile and later imprisoned him, and declared himself governor by the power of the Audencia in 1722. Antequera also accused the Jesuits of various crimes, demanded that the mission Indians under their care be enslaved and distributed to the citizens of Paraguay, and expelled the Jesuits from their college in Asunci√≥n. All these actions had the support of the citizens of Asunci√≥n, and governors had been deposed and replaced before without the central government complaining. However, Viceroy of Peru Diego Morcillo, residing in Lima, did not approve of Antequera's action and ordered Reyes' restoration as governor. With the backing of the settlers, Antequera refused, citing the authority of the Audencia as superior to that of the Viceroy. The feud between Antequera and the Viceroyalty continued after Viceroy Morcillo was replaced by the Marquis of Castelfuerte as Viceroy of Peru. Antequera's Paraguayan militia attacked and defeated an allied force of Jesuit mission Indians and Spanish colonial forces during the standoff. The battle tainted the legitimacy of Antequera's claim of governorship, however, and a second force was sent by Castelfuerte against a movement now seen as clearly treasonous. Antequera resigned in 1725 and fled to Charcas, while order was seemingly restored in the province. Antequera was arrested, imprisoned for five years at Lima, and executed. Paraguay was quiet for 5 years under interim governor Mart√≠n de Bar√∫a, seen as friendly to the settlers and hostile to the Jesuits. When he was replaced by Ignacio de Soroeta, however, Paraguay refused its new governor. Fernando de M√≥mpox y Zayas had spread ideas among the populace that the power of the people - the com√∫n - was superior to that of the governor and even the King. The comuneros held new elections to the town council of Asunci√≥n, won the seats, and resumed self-rule. A replacement governor sent in 1732, Agust√≠n de Ruyloba, was killed by the comuneros. However, the comunero movement split several times. The notables of Asunci√≥n, who had been happy to defy the colonial authorities when the town council was run by them, now feared the total breakdown of order, as the poorer Paraguayans started to loot the estates and property of any notable not thought to be sufficiently pro- comunero. The inability of Asunci√≥n to trade with the rest of the Spanish Empire led to an economic crisis, as well. When colonial forces finally moved on Asunci√≥n, the divided comuneros scattered and fled, with most of the Asunci√≥n faction joining the government forces in a bid for clemency. Background =A tradition of self-government= Paraguay was one of the most loosely controlled parts of the Spanish Empire by the Crown, with a strong independent streak in its leadership. This partially stemmed from a quirk of history in 1537. Shortly after the first settlements on the Rio de la Plata were made, Governor Pedro de Mendoza died. The crown subsequently issued a Royal Decree ('), which stated that if Mendoza had named a successor, that successor was confirmed as governor. However, if Mendoza had not named a successor - or the successor was dead - a replacement should be \\"peaceably elected.\\" An election was a unique privilege in Spain's American colonies; historian Adalberto L√≥pez calls it \\"strange\\" as King Charles V was a ruthless centralizer who spent much of his reign curtailing the autonomy of Spain's various holdings, especially since Paraguay was still thought to hold precious metals at the time.Lopez, p. 6-12. A further oddity is that the decree did not limit the use of election to a one-time exigency. The citizens of Paraguay used the decree to elect a governor, and would use it many more times to not merely elect replacement governors, but also to depose disliked appointed governors. The decree of 1537 was used again in 1544 to justify a coup against √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, who had reigned as governor for only two years. Cabeza de Vaca had attempted to control the settlers' abuse of the native Indians, earning him the dislike of many of the colonists. He was arrested, a replacement governor was proclaimed, and he was sent back to Spain in chains with a number of likely false crimes accused of him. Some Paraguayan historians would later attempt to tie this 1544 coup to the Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile from 1520‚Äì1521 and call this the \\"First Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay.\\" While Cabeza de Vaca had been part of the royalist forces in that earlier struggle and had helped defeat the Castilian comuneros, it is unlikely that contemporary Paraguayans identified themselves with the Castilian comuneros, according to L√≥pez. As the plotters hoped to attain legitimacy for their choice of governor in the eyes of the king, identifying themselves with despised rebels would have been counterproductive. Rather, the main contemporary references to the Paraguayans calling themselves comuneros come from sources friendly to Cabeza de Vaca seeking to discredit the coup in the eyes of the king. Governors in office were more constrained than elsewhere in the Spanish Empire.Lopez, p. 13-21. Unpopular governors faced the threat of being removed through the application of the Decree of 1537; but even when such drastic measures were not used, the governor's power was curtailed. The cabildo (town council) of Asunci√≥n was powerful, and governors often found it difficult for their edicts to be enforced or obeyed if they acted without consulting the cabildo and securing its consent.Lopez, p. 30-32. Spain contributed relatively little in the way of troops, officials, funds, or armaments to Paraguay, and after it was determined that the region was not in fact rich in precious metals or other resources, immigration slowed.Saeger, p.217. However, the interior of South America was dangerous, with Portuguese- aligned slavers and hostile Indian tribes to threaten the Paraguayans. Paraguay fended for itself with an armed militia. This also limited the governor's influence, as it was the members of the cabildo who rallied the militia. =The Jesuit missions= The Jesuit missions were concentrated in the modern border regions between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. At the time, the entire area was ruled by the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1588, the first missionaries from the Society of Jesus arrived in Asunci√≥n at the invitation of the settlers and the governor. They set to work at converting the Indians in the area. They also built a prominent church and college; the college was the only educational institution of any importance in the province.Lopez, p. 34-35. The Jesuits gathered a large number of Indians under their care, where they were able to go about Christianizing them and introducing the Indians to elements of Spanish civilization. Most importantly, the Jesuits were able to offer Indians under their care a measure of protection against other whites. Indians on their mission would not be sold into slavery, tricked out of their goods, or have their women taken for extra wives. Over time, an entire \\"empire within an empire\\" was built up, and the Jesuits took on responsibilities far beyond religious education. In order to pay royal taxes for the Indians, the Jesuits ran an economy and sold goods at market. In order to defend against Portuguese slavers and hostile Indians, the Jesuits gathered armaments and trained in the arts of war.Lopez, p. 36-40. This arming was highly controversial and was opposed by the Paraguayan settlers, but the constant threat of Portuguese invasion meant the Spanish Crown gave its consent. As time went on, relations between the settlers and the Jesuits soured. The native population of the Guaran√≠ Indians, initially large compared to the number of Spanish settlers, decreased greatly. In part this was due to the abuse and overwork engendered by the encomienda system, a legal framework similar to slavery, and in part due to the Spanish laws that declared the offspring of Spaniards and their Guaran√≠ wives to be Spaniards themselves and thus entitled to their own native slaves under encomienda. As immigration slowed, the province became heavily populated by Spanish-Guaran√≠ mestizo (mixed blood) descendants, who, due to the increasing unavailability of pure- blood Guarani to claim as servants, became a new class of \\"poor whites.\\" Meanwhile, the Guaran√≠ on the Jesuit missions were flourishing, and many Guaran√≠ actively chose mission life over remaining independent or risking falling into the encomienda system. The result was a perceived \\"shortage\\" of cheap encomienda labor - a shortage that could be fixed if the Jesuit mission Indians were taken and impressed into the encomienda.Saeger, p.218. Additionally, the Jesuit missions were an economic competitor to Paraguay's settlers, as both's major export was yerba mate used for the production of the caffeinated drink mate. The variety of yerba produced in the mission lands (yerba caamin√≠) was considered superior to the yerba harvested in the civil province (yerba de palos), pushing down the Paraguayan's margins even further. Since the mission lands were closed off to almost all Paraguayans, wild rumors about Jesuit activities within them found easy currency among the Paraguayans. Tales of hidden great treasures and secret lucrative mines worked by captive Indians were not uncommon. By the early 1600s, the average Paraguayan despised the Jesuits. Some agitated for the government to take action against them, and at the very least the idea of extending further \\"privileges\\" was out of the question.Lopez, p. 48-58. A series of intrigues took place from 1640-1650 with pro-Jesuit governor Gregorio de Hinestrosa vying against the anti-Jesuit Bishop Bernardino de C√°rdenas, a Franciscan. C√°rdenas was exiled to Corrientes, but upon the end of Hinestrosa's governorship returned to Asunci√≥n. The new governor Diego de Escobar y Osorio attempted to remain neutral in the conflict between the Jesuits and the settlers who were now backed by the returned C√°rdenas, and successfully avoided bloodshed for a time, but in 1649 Osorio died. The cabildo, seizing on the Decree of 1537, promptly elected C√°rdenas the new governor, and with his support expelled the Jesuits from their college in Asunci√≥n. They wrote in explanation of their actions that the Jesuits were destroying the province, and it was the \\"natural right\\" of people to defend themselves against aggression. Governor-Bishop C√°rdenas, in similar proto-democratic language, said \\"the voice of the People is the voice of God.\\"Lopez, p. 60-63. The authorities were displeased, and the Jesuits, with the government's permission, sent in an army of mission Indians to depose C√°rdenas. C√°rdenas and the Paraguayan militia decided to resist, and in a battle on October 5, 1649, the Jesuit army of roughly 700 Indians won a complete victory. The Paraguayans were scattered, C√°rdenas and his closest supporters were arrested, and the citizens of Asunci√≥n were subjected to the humiliation of an occupying army of Indians patrolling their streets and enforcing the new governor's rule. This wound never healed. By 1721, hatred of the Jesuits was even more intense than it was in the early 1600s. 1721-1725: Antequera's contested governorship The Audiencia of Charcas in Upper Peru had power over the blue area of the Viceroyalty of Peru, marked \\"5,\\" including Paraguay. In 1717, Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda became governor of Paraguay. He purchased the position from the Spanish authorities, a practice that had spread at the time. Reyes was a merchant who had made his fortune trading exporting yerba mate from Paraguay and importing various cheap and needed manufactures back to Paraguay, so he was seen as qualified for the post by the Spanish Crown.Lopez, p. 79-80. Reyes was an open admirer of the Jesuits. Two of his wife's uncles were members of the Jesuit order, and several of his most important advisors were Jesuits. His policies were also seen by the settlers as pro-Jesuit. Reyes' Jesuit advisors instigated him to order an attack on the Payagu√° Indians of the Chaco despite a tenuous truce established three years earlier in 1717; all of the captured Payagu√°s were remitted to the Jesuits for conversion to Christianity and mission life. The settlers received none of the captives for the encomienda, although it had been the settler militia that risked their lives fighting the Payagu√°s and colonial trade and outlying farms would now be threatened by retaliatory Payagu√° raids. The Payagu√°s, who lived in the Gran Chaco, were considerably less likely to threaten the Jesuits, with their missions farther to the east of the civil province of Paraguya.Saeger, p. 219-220. Reyes acquired a reputation for enriching himself using the powers of his office to control trade. Reyes also taxed important members of the Paraguayan elite to fund the construction of defensive fortifications. The end result was that Reyes was a deeply unpopular governor who found the majority of the cabildo of Asunci√≥n actively seeking his removal. In a bid to keep his position, Reyes accused his chief antagonists of treason and had them imprisoned. The notables of Asunci√≥n complained to the Real Audiencia of Charcas, accusing Reyes both of imprisoning the cabildo members without good cause, as well as general unlawful conduct as governor. The Audiencia of Charcas took up the investigation of Reyes. The Audencias, the judicial system of colonial Spain, had a wide degree of latitude and independence from the viceroy. Charcas (now known as Sucre) was quite distant from the viceregal capital of Lima, amplifying the court's power even further. In 1721, the audiencia sent judge Jos√© de Antequera y Castro to Asunci√≥n to dispense justice as he saw fit. Antequera was a young rising star of the court, and even his fiercest critics wrote that he was likable, handsome, intelligent, and unusually well-educated for the time.Lopez, p. 85. The Audiencia gave Antequera a sealed document to open if he found Reyes guilty. The Audiencia and Antequera ordered Reyes to release the council members he had imprisoned and that he not interfere in the investigation in any way. After interviewing the witnesses accusing Reyes of misdeeds, Antequera concluded that the evidence was so strong as to warrant the immediate arrest of Reyes in September 1721.Lopez, p. 84-89. Antequera presented to the cabildo the sealed document he'd been given by the Audiencia. The document gave Antequera the position of governor, which he took over the objections of Reyes' remaining supporters. In April 1722, Antequera officially found Reyes guilty and dismissed him as governor, although Reyes immediately escaped Asunci√≥n on the same day the sentence was handed down. Antequera proceeded to impound much of Reyes' property and also order the arrest of many of Reyes' friends and supporters, taking their property to be sold at public auction as well. With all these actions, Antequera earned the support and adulation of the majority of the province, though he was hated by those who had done well under Reyes. Antequera clinched his popularity by taking a stand against the hated Jesuits; he endorsed settlers' demands that the mission Indians be distributed to the encomienda, that secular (paid by the Spanish government) priests be put in charge of the Jesuit missions, and that a customs house be established to enforce limits on Jesuit exports of yerba mate. To historian James Saeger, Antequera comes across as mostly well-meaning; he sincerely believed imposing the civil authority upon the independent Jesuit missions would benefit the Empire.Saeger, p. 224. It is quite possible that the matter would have ended with Antequera's succession to Governor of Paraguay until a new royal governor was appointed for the province. However, friends of Reyes reached Lima, where they pleaded their case to the Viceregal court. With the support of the influential Jesuits, they convinced Viceroy of Peru Diego Morcillo that Reyes was the victim of a plot by jealous Paraguayans and an ambitious Antequera.Lopez, p. 90-92. Viceroy Morcillo conducted a stormy correspondence with the Audencia of Charcas, accusing them of having overstepped their authority and that giving the chief judge of the case against Reyes the power to succeed him as governor was illegal. On three separate occasions from 1721-1723 he demanded the reinstatement of Reyes as governor. The Audencia responded that this was a judicial matter, and the Viceroy was the one overstepping his bounds. The Jesuits held a ceremony proclaiming the escaped Reyes as the legitimate governor. Reyes also went to Corrientes, where the authorities recognized his claim and began impounding carts & goods of traders who refused to support Reyes' claim. Trade between Paraguay and the rest of the Spanish Empire was interrupted. The situation degenerated further after a group of men loyal to Antequera came to Corrientes and kidnapped Reyes in the night, dragging him back to Asunci√≥n - a highly illegal act in the eyes of the citizens of Corrientes and the Viceroy, as the government of Paraguay had no lawful power in Corrientes. Enraged, the Viceroy finally opted for military force, ordering Governor Zavala of Buenos Aires to prepare an army to march on Asunci√≥n to depose Antequera.Lopez, p. 94. Antequera rallied the Paraguayan militia in response, while Zavala sent his lieutenant governor Baltasar Garc√≠a Ros to marshall both Jesuit mission Indians, his own troops from Buenos Aires, and reinforcements from Villa Rica. Zavala had hoped a peaceful resolution might still be possible, but Garc√≠a Ros was not well received by the Paraguayans. He had briefly served as interim governor of Paraguay from 1706-1707, and was known to be a great supporter of the Jesuits. He had worked with the Jesuit armies of mission Indians before in fighting the Portuguese, where the Jesuits gained his admiration with their support; he had also allegedly ignored a royal award of 300 mission Indians to the settlers in the encomienda while interim governor to please the Jesuits.Saeger, p. 226. Meanwhile, in Asunci√≥n, the Jesuits were run out of their college by a mob of citizens, and given 3 hours to leave by the cabildo. The armies exchanged hostile letters, and it seemed briefly that a show of force might persuade the other side to back down. However, on August 25, 1724, the Paraguayans misinterpreted Indians celebrating the feast of St. Luis as preparations for a military attack. The Paraguayans attacked the dancing and parading Indians, and won a complete victory with the element of surprise. Hundreds of Indians were killed, all of the arms, ammunition, and papers were taken, and the royal army was forced into full retreat. A band of citizens of Villa Rica who arrived late as reinforcements surrendered immediately, and saw their leader executed. The victory came unexpectedly cheap, as well; only five settlers were killed, and 20 wounded.Lopez, p. 97-100. 150 captured mission Indians were distributed to the settlers in encomienda servitude. The new Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Castelfuerte, took an even stronger line against the rebellion than the previous Viceroy. The Paraguayan's victory was fleeting, however. The new Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Castelfuerte, was a dedicated supporter of absolutist monarchy who was not about to allow disobedience to the lawful authorities to linger and spread. The Audencia of Charcas was sent a final warning that continuing to meddle in the Paraguayan affair would not be tolerated; perhaps frightened by both the new Viceroy's connections in Spain as well as Antequera's battle against the Spanish forces, the Audencia backed down and ceased to campaign on Antequera's behalf. A second expedition was organized by Zavala personally, with more forces, while the bishop of Asunci√≥n, who had never supported Antequera, implored the cabildo in the strongest of terms to back down and accept Zavala without a fight. The stronger force made it clear that continuing to struggle would be fruitless. Zavala additionally guaranteed that the Jesuit mission Indians would not enter the civil territory this time if the settlers submitted peacefully. Zavala made no mention of retribution or arrests, as well. The cabildo decided to submit to Zavala; Antequera fled to Charcas, where he was arrested.Lopez, p. 101-105. 1725-1730: A temporary peace Zavala pursued a conciliatory policy with the Paraguayan settlers, not wishing to aggravate the situation. Reprimands were handed down, but few fines, and no arrests, exiles, or executions. Members of the cabildo kept their posts. Ill and emaciated, former governor Reyes was quietly freed from more than a year in conditions that approached solitary confinement, but told that to avoid trouble it would be best if he never showed himself in the province again. Zavala left after only two months in Asunci√≥n, placing Mart√≠n de Bar√∫a in charge as interim governor.Lopez, p. 106-107. Bar√∫a would serve as governor until 1730, as the first two replacement governors failed to arrive in Asunci√≥n; one was arrested after he beat his wife, and the other died in transit in the Atlantic Ocean. Bar√∫a proved sympathetic to the settlers and hostile to the Jesuits; he sent letters to the Jesuits threatening to investigate claimed abuses of the mission Indians, and also wrote the Viceroy with similar concerns about the Jesuit missions. He assured the Viceroy that the Paraguayans were loyal servants of the Crown, and that the burden of defending Paraguay against hostile Indian raids would be lessened if the Jesuits were to share their mission Indians with the encomienda.Lopez, p. 108-111. The main dispute of Bar√∫a's tenure was the return of the Jesuits to their college in Asunci√≥n. The Viceroy had ordered the Jesuits to be restored, but Zavala had not immediately complied for fear of re-igniting the revolt, and Bar√∫a and the settlers were actively hostile to the Jesuits' return. Bar√∫a procrastinated on implementing the Viceroy's orders as letters were exchanged; it was not until extremely blunt orders demanding the immediate reinstatement of the Jesuits with all the pomp and solemnity required for the occasion came that Bar√∫a complied in 1728. The antagonism continued, however. In 1730, Governor Bar√∫a and the Jesuits traded accusations of malfeasance on the Jesuit lands in reports sent to Madrid. Bar√∫a also invited the travelling orator Fernando de Momp√≥ y Zayas to be one of his advisors in 1730. Momp√≥'s origins are cloudy, but he was educated and quite possibly a lawyer. He had acquired a reputation as a troublemaker in Lima. Momp√≥ was imprisoned there, possibly meeting Antequera in prison, but at some point either escaped or was exiled. He eventually made his way to Paraguay, where he spread his ideas about government and the role of the people, which were considered radical at the time. According to Momp√≥, the Paraguayans had been within their rights when they overthrew Reyes and defied Garc√≠a Ros; political authority rested on the assent of the com√∫n, the community. The power of the people, Momp√≥ said, was greater than even the King or the Pope.Lopez, p. 112-113. 1730-1735: The comuneros In late 1730, news came to Paraguay that a third replacement governor was on the way, Ignacio de Soroeta. Rumors spread that Soroeta was a friend of the Jesuits and Reyes. Momp√≥ rallied his followers, called the comuneros, and raised a force of 300 outside the city. A delegation of the comuneros sent to the cabildo demanded that the new governor be denied entry. Bar√∫a demanded that the comuneros disband; when they refused, he resigned his post in frustration. The comuneros demanded new elections of the cabildo, which, unsurprisingly, they won. Only those members who had accepted the rebel line were re-elected, while the other cabildo members were replaced by comuneros. When Soroeta arrived, he was informed he was not wanted, and only allowed to stay in Asunci√≥n for four days under virtual house arrest. Convinced there was nothing to be done, Soroeta left; Bar√∫a and Bishop Palos of Asunci√≥n also left. The city was entirely under comunero control. Despite the new comunero influence on the cabildo, Momp√≥ desired an even more radical shift. He apparently felt that he could not abolish the cabildo directly; instead, he created his own parallel governmental structure, the Junta Gobernativa, whose members were elected by the people.Lopez, p. 113-118. However, this was a step too far toward treason for some members of the cabildo whom Momp√≥ had assumed would have been compliant. The new mayor of Asunci√≥n, Jos√© Luis Barreyro (Bareiro), built his own power base in Asunci√≥n as the comuneros splintered and factionalized. Momp√≥'s faction of the comuneros controlled the rural areas, and Barreyro's faction saw him as a threat. Barreyo arranged the quiet arrest of Momp√≥ while he was alone and sent him to the Jesuits, from whom he eventually found his way to a jail in Buenos Aires. Momp√≥ would soon escape prison again, but rather than return to Paraguay he fled to Brazil. Barreyro's victory was short-lived; while Momp√≥'s faction of the comuneros were thrown into confusion for several months, they eventually rallied, and he found few Asunci√≥n militia members willing to fight against them. Barreyro and his supporters were forced to flee to the Jesuit missions, and the more radical comuneros once again ruled both Asunci√≥n and the rural areas. News of the refusal of Governor Soroeta reached Lima, which doomed the defense of the imprisoned Antequera. Convinced that Antequera was behind the new uprising, the trial was accelerated, and Antequera was sentenced to death. The Franciscans, friendly to Antequera, organized a mob shouting for his pardon and blocked the way to the public execution site on July 5, 1731, so Antequera was shot instead on the way there. The execution of Antequera disheartened some of the leading citizens of Asunci√≥n, because not only was Antequera executed, but also one of his allies who had been considerably less involved, perhaps implying a forthcoming purge of any of Antequera's supporters.Lopez, p. 126-130. Settler- Jesuit relations now collapsed again. The Jesuits had rallied an Indian army, but not crossed the Tebicuary River to the settler lands, and had assured the settlers it was only for self-defense. While the Jesuit college had been ignored in the earlier stages of the comunero affair, now the comuneros expelled the Jesuits from their Asunci√≥n college yet again. Enraged at this interference with the church, the Bishop of Asunci√≥n placed the province under the interdict and excommunicated the rebels for the sack of the Jesuits' church, although this was temporarily lifted when a band of colonists were needed to fight the Payagu√° Indians. The comunero army and the Jesuit army of Indians came close to clashing, but after a tense series of communications, both backed off and agreed to a truce. The position of Governor of Paraguay still sat vacant. While the Viceroy of Peru selected a favored candidate whom he believed could restore order to the province, he was unknowingly pre-empted by the King, who selected Agust√≠n de Ruyloba to be the new Governor of Paraguay. While Ruyloba was given a force of 300 soldiers by Governor Zavala in Buenos Aires, he left it behind, choosing to believe the promises the Paraguayans sent of their loyalty to the King.Lopez, p. 135-139. He arrived in Asunci√≥n, was accepted by the cabildo as the new governor, and declared in a speech that the establishment of the Junta Gobernativa had been treason, and anyone attempting to revive it would be publicly executed. Ruyloba waited three weeks assessing the situation, then began to dispense the justice that the Viceroy had ordered. All elections to the cabildo since 1730 were declared invalid, and the cabildo and leadership of the militia was purged. Ruyloba also began preparations for the return of the Jesuits to their college in Asunci√≥n. This was acting far too confidently and fast for the citizens of Asunci√≥n; Ruyloba's thin support as governor collapsed, and the comuneros began to rally in the countryside again, with Ruyloba largely oblivious. When Ruyloba learnt about the comunero army, he rallied the Asunci√≥n militia to ride and meet it, but found his own army deserting him en masse, unwilling to fight their countrymen. Ruyloba met with the rebel leaders, and was advised to agree to at least some changes by the priest Arregui, known to be sympathetic to both sides. Ruyloba refused to make any concessions. For honor's sake, Ruyloba still took the field with his pistol afterward, despite having almost his entire army desert, and was killed in a brief battle with the rebels. The comuneros promptly rode to Asunci√≥n, reinstated the Junta, declared all of Ruyloba's acts invalid, and looted the properties of Ruyloba's supporters. They also elected the eighty-year-old Bishop Juan de Arregui of Buenos Aires as a figurehead governor. The government of Asunci√≥n split into three: the old official rulership structure headed by Arregui which was largely a rubber stamp, but provided a cloak of legitimacy; the city leadership, dominated by the rich families which had avoided being looted for being insufficiently pro- comunero; and the countryside comuneros, who were the most influenced by Momp√≥'s philosophy of self-governance.Lopez, p. 146-150. As far as the Asunci√≥n faction was concerned, the goal of the revolt had been achieved with Ruyloba's death, and business as usual could resume with a hopefully more pliant governor. However, the poor rural comuneros were not finished with the revolt. The war became a war of the poor against the rich; the ranches of the wealthy were raided, shipments of yerba mate were impounded, and cattle were stolen. The leaders of the countryside were considered illiterate political nonentities by the notables of Asunci√≥n, \\"rural barbarians\\" according to one account, who could not be contained once unleashed. People who dared speak out against them, especially in the countryside, were killed. Commerce came to a standstill as both sides refused to allow trade; the Junta would not allow anyone to leave without their permission on pain of death, and Zavala had blockaded the province. As the economic crisis deepened, the cabildo of Asunci√≥n not only completely broke with the Junta, but became prepared to fight it themselves, seeing them as having sunk to countryside bandits. The expected colonial armed response was delayed due to a number of factors, most notably a famine and plague that struck the Jesuit missions which made mobilizing their army difficult. By 1735, however, Zavala was ready to move in once more. While some comuneros rallied an army as a show of force, no battles were actually fought; without the support of Asunci√≥n, and against an experienced campaigner with superior forces, the comunero armies melted and their soldiers tried to escape.Lopez, p. 153-156. Zavala's army retook Asunci√≥n. Unlike his previous occupation of Asunci√≥n, this time Zavala sought to suppress any future revolt with sterner reprisals. Many of the ringleaders of the Asunci√≥n faction were arrested regardless despite their late support for the royal army; there was a series of exiles and executions. All of the actions of the cabildo since the death of Ruyloba were declared null and void, as were any actions of the Junta. Zavala declared that since the Royal Decree of 1537 was not mentioned in the 1680 publishing of \\"Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies\\" (Recopilaci√≥n de Leyes de las Indias), it was no longer valid and any attempt to elect a governor again would be treason. In October, the Jesuits were once again returned to their college in Asunci√≥n. Later influence Monument to the Comuneros & Antequera in Asunci√≥n While some of the ideologies of self-government espoused by the comuneros seem to prefigure later democratic uprisings against Spanish colonial rule, especially among the rural branch of the revolt, historians Adalberto L√≥pez and James Schofield Saeger caution that giving this apparent resemblance too much weight would be a mistake. According to Saegar, the revolt was much closer to traditions of the 16th and 17th centuries and \\"was principally a local uprising led by local vested interest groups and unrelated to the important changes in the Spanish empire beginning in the 18th century.\\"Saeger, p. 229. It had little in common with the Revolt of the Comuneros of New Granada or the Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II that occurred in the 1780s. L√≥pez agrees that the Revolt of the Comuneros was not a \\"true revolution\\" that aimed at fundamental change in Paraguay; most of the Paraguayans saw themselves as loyal servants of the Crown and were not attempting to fundamentally change the political or economic structure of the province. Rather, they were attempting to assert control over the Jesuits, who were seen as undermining the province and exacerbating its poverty.Lopez, p. 157. Paraguay remained poor and somewhat discontented after the revolt was suppressed. Higher taxes imposed later further squeezed the region's export income, and the Jesuit missions continued to be a hated competitor driving down prices of the Paraguayan's cash crop. Antequera became a folk hero and martyr. The new cabildo, attempting to suppress talk of him, unwisely ordered the public burning of all \\"dangerous\\" documents in the city archives in 1740.Lopez, p. 160-161. A would-be coup against the governor organized by some who had been friendly to the comuneros before was discovered in 1747; the plotters were arrested, convicted of treason, and executed. The Jesuits, however, saw their previously solid support in the royal courts of Europe dry up in the middle of the 18th century for a number of reasons. The theocratic Jesuit missions which expected total obedience to the Fathers grated against the Enlightenment values which were gaining favor among intellectuals. Both the Jesuits and their enemies agreed that the Jesuits were wealthy and prosperous: according to their enemies, due to illegal theft of the best land and corruption; according to the Jesuits, due to their own ability, intellect, and hard work.Lopez, p. 162-163. The Jesuits' influence, money, and near-monopoly on education helped spawn the backlash against them. The Jesuits had lost the support of the Portuguese government in 1750 after they opposed the 1750 treaty of Madrid which led to the Guaran√≠ War; they were expelled from the Portuguese Empire entirely in 1758. The Jesuits next lost the support of Charles III of Spain after the Esquilache Riots, food riots in Madrid in 1766. Charles III fled Madrid for a time, and his ministers convinced him that the riots had been masterminded by the Jesuits as part of a plot. The Jesuits were expelled from the Spanish Empire. In 1767, they were expelled from their college in Asunci√≥n, to the elation of its citizens; by the end of 1768, the Jesuits had been expelled from the missions in Paraguay and replaced by secular administrators. The best lands in the former mission territories were quickly taken by white settlers; the herds of cattle were impounded and dwindled; and the mission Indians scattered and diminished. Within a short period of time, the Jesuit missions of Paraguay were but a memory. The comuneros' reputation was rehabilitated; already folk heroes in the people's eyes, the Spanish government softened its stance on the comuneros as well. A new inquiry in Madrid concluded that Antequera had been the victim of a Jesuit conspiracy. On April 1, 1778, King Charles III signed a document which declared Antequera had been a dedicated and loyal servant of the Crown, and provided pensions for some of his relatives. Both Lima and Asunci√≥n feature streets named after Antequera. A monument on a hill in Asunci√≥n honors Antequera and all those who fought and died in the Revolt of the Comuneros as precursors to Latin America's liberation movements.

There are 67 BB 27300 locomotives, built as part of the Prima range by Alstom. The first BB 27300 were delivered starting in 2006. Painted in the blue and white livery of Transilien, the brand name for the SNCF network around Paris, these locomotives are the passenger equivalent of the freight-only SNCF Class BB 27000 and are equipped for push-pull operation on suburban passenger services in the √éle-de-France region around Paris, working with refurbished VB2N double-deck carriages. Technical information The power of the locomotive is . The locomotive is equipped with a train protection system derived from the contr√¥le de vitesse par balises system : the KVBP. It is also equipped with two pantographs, one dedicated to the 1500 V direct current, the other to the 25000 V alternating current.  History  The BB 27300 were authorized on the national network of France in 2006 by the . #119, p16 and p17 Orders The first batch of 60 locomotives was ordered in 2004, and following testing of the first two units in 2005, delivered progressively into 2008. Follow-up orders for five and two locomotives respectively were placed. The locomotives are numbered in series from 27301-27367, although the number carried on the locomotive is prefixed with the number 8, to denote the unit as belonging to the √éle-de-France division of SNCF. Usage The first locomotives entered service in 2006 on suburban trains from Paris Montparnasse railway station. Current deployment sees a total of 25 locomotives operating services from Paris-Montparnasse on trains to Dreux, Mantes-la-Jolie and Rambouillet. At Montparnasse they have displaced older SNCF Class BB 8500 and BB 25500 locomotives. A further 42 locomotives operate from Paris Saint-Lazare railway station on trains to Poissy, Mantes-la-Jolie, Pontoise, Gisors, and Ermont Eaubonne. At Saint-Lazare BB 8500 and BB 17000 locomotives have been displaced. Future The usage of BB 27300 locomotives on suburban passenger services is a temporary measure. It is expected that sometime after 2015 they will begin to be replaced by new Electric Multiple Units. When this happens, the locomotives are likely to find further use with SNCF's freight subsidiary, SNCF Fret, where they will join the technically similar BB 27000 locomotives.

He was the owner of the Pearson conglomerate. Background Pearson was born on 15 July 1856 at Shelley, Woodhouse, Yorkshire, the son of George Pearson (died 1899) by his wife Sarah Dickinson, a daughter of Weetman Dickinson.Burke's Peerage,106th edition page 688 Business career The family construction business S. Pearson & Son was founded in 1844 by his grandfather Samuel Pearson (1814‚Äì1884). Weetman Pearson took over the company in 1880 and later moved the headquarters from Yorkshire to London. An early proponent of globalization, S. Pearson & Son built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, docks in Halifax, tunnels, railways and harbours around the world, and the Sennar Dam in Sudan. In 1900, the company took over the construction of the Great Northern and City Railway in London and after completion in 1904 ran it for four years.S Halliday Underground to Everywhere Sutton Publishing 2001 p52 In 1907 he established an investment company, Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd which, under the direction of his son Clive Pearson, played an important role in the development of British airlines in the 1930s. Today Pearson Plc is mainly engaged in the business of publishing. =Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company= In 1889, Porfirio Diaz, the President of Mexico, invited Pearson to his country to build a railroadthe Tehuantepec Railwayfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. On one of Pearson's trips to Mexico, he missed a rail connection in Laredo, Texas, and was obliged to spend the night in the town which he described as \\"wild with the oil craze\\" from the recent discovery of oil at Spindletop. After doing some quick research that night about oil seepages in Mexico, Pearson began acquiring prospective oil lands in Laredo, thinking he could use discovered oil to fuel the Tehuantepec Railway he was building.Yergin, Daniel, \\"The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power\\", Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.230-232 In 1902, after sulphur was found in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Pearson used a Texas drilling crew to drill Potrerillos, a rise of ground close to his railway. Well No. 4 confirmed the location of a salt dome at a depth of 709 feet. This was a good sign, since oil was found at Spindletop in 1901, alongside the edge of a salt dome. Well No 8 became Mexico's first commercial oil well. Pearson then brought in Anthony Lucas to help spot 20 drilling locations, developing areas at J√°ltipan, Capacan, Tecuanapa, and Soldedad. In 1908, Eagle built Mexico's first oil refinery, located at Minatitl√°n. In 1910, Potrero del Llano No. 4, came in as a real gusher. In 1921, Pearson added Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company (Cia. Mexicana de Petroleo el Aguila, S.A.) to the Shell-Royal Dutch merger. In 1911, President Diaz was overthrown and the Mexican Revolution began. The associated violence and turmoil had a negative effect on foreign investors in Mexico's oil industry. In October 1918 Pearson sold a substantial portion of Mexican Eagle stock to Calouste Gulbenkian, on behalf of Royal Dutch Shell, which took over its management. Political career Pearson was created a Baronet, of Paddockhurst, in the Parish of Worth, in the County of Sussex, and of Airlie Gardens, in the Parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, in the County of London, in 1894. He was first elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Colchester at a by-election in February 1895.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918; Macmillan, 1974 p98 He held the seat at the 1895 general election and retained it until 1910 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cowdray, of Midhurst in the County of Sussex. His time is connected with a number of developments, most notably the opening of Colchester Castle to the public. Under his leadership during World War I, the munitions factory HM Factory, Gretna and the tank assembly at Chateauroux were built. In January 1917, he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Viscount Cowdray, of Cowdray in the County of Sussex. That same month, David Lloyd George requested that he become President of the Air Board. Cowdray agreed, provided that he receive no salary. Lord Cowdray worked diligently to improve the output of aircraft and produced a threefold increase in the number of aircraft under his tenure. Yet he was criticized after German bombing produced over 600 casualties on 13 June, and resigned the following November. Following the war, he was active in Liberal politics and in philanthropic activities. He endowed a professorship in the Spanish department at the University of Leeds, and contributed to University College London, the League of Nations Union, the Royal Air Force Club and Memorial Fund, and to many public projects.

Early in September as the Allied Armies were rolled back toward the River Marne during the German drive on Paris, he was captured near the town of Varreddes, and died on 6 September 1914 at age 23. He was buried at the Montreuil-aux-Lions British Cemetery. Reports surfaced later that he had been treated with unconscionable brutality by his captors, which directly caused his death. Great indignation was raised by these reports, one of many that were flooding out of Northern France at the time. The incident was referenced by Arthur Conan Doyle in his 1914 book \\"The German War\\" (Chapter VI, 'A Policy of Murder'), who called him \\"the gallant motor-cyclist, Pearson\\". *Gertrude Mary Pearson (Gertrude Mary, Baroness Denman, GBE), who married Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman, Governor- General of Australia.

Three days later, the two bodies were discovered by Knobling's father and a search party along the water's edge of the James River. =Third couple= On April 10, 1988, Christopher Newport University students Cassandra Lee Hailey, 18, and Richard Keith Call, 20, were reported missing after attending a party in the University Square area in Newport News during their first date together. Call's red 1982 Toyota Celica was found, unoccupied, at the York River Overlook on the Colonial Parkway the next day with some articles of clothing inside. Their bodies have never been found but both are presumed dead. =Fourth couple= On September 5, 1989, just after Labor Day weekend, Annamaria Phelps, 18, and Daniel Lauer, 21, vanished while en route to Virginia Beach. Phelps had been dating Lauer's brother at the time they went missing. Lauer's car, a gold 1972 Chevrolet Nova, was soon found abandoned at the I-64 New Kent rest stop in New Kent County and it was discovered to have been heading in the wrong direction, away from their intended Virginia Beach destination. On October 19, 1989, the skeletonized bodies of Phelps and Lauer were found in a wooded area by hunters along Interstate 64 between Williamsburg and Richmond. The hunters discovered the bodies on a logging road about a quarter-of-a-mile from Courthouse Road, a location about a mile from the I-64 New Kent rest stop where Lauer's car was found. At least one of the badly decomposed bodies appears to have suffered knife wounds. Media coverage In 1996, the unsolved case of the Colonial Parkway Murders was presented on national television on the program Real Stories of the Highway Patrol, a series that aired from 1993-1999. Actor Steve Altes portrayed the killer. In 2007, the disappearance and presumed murder of Cassandra Hailey and Keith Call were featured in the Investigation Discovery program Sensing Murder, whereby investigators brought in psychics Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell to gain new insights into the crimes. The show mentioned that this disappearance may be part of the Colonial Parkway Murders. Psychic Pam Coronado felt that the killings were all related but that the location of the cars were not where the actual violence occurred. In 2008, E! Entertainment Television presented a full-length documentary, THS Investigates Serial Killers on the Loose, which features a segment on the Colonial Parkway Murders. In 2013, the Colonial Parkway Murders were profiled in the Investigation Discovery television series Dark Minds, with host and true crime author M. William Phelps. In October/November 2015, the Colonial Parkway Murders were featured in a three-part podcast series produced by student journalists at College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA. In February to May, 2016, the Unsolved Podcast in Baltimore, MD did a four-part podcast series, each episode focused on one of the double homicides in the Colonial Parkway Murders. In October 2016, there was extensive coverage of the 30th anniversary of the Colonial Parkway Murders, including an 8 part multimedia presentation by the Daily Press newspaper. In September 2009, it was discovered by CBS News affiliate WTKR that nearly 80 highly graphic crime scene photographs of Colonial Parkway Murders victims were used to instruct a class by a retired and now deceased former FBI photographer. Former WTKR investigative reporter Mike Mather found that much of the evidence stowed for over two decades, had yet to be tested for DNA and other trace evidence. In 2010, a team from FBI Norfolk and FBI Headquarters met with the victims' families. Spingola profile In June 2010, the victims' families requested the assistance of a retired Milwaukee Police Department homicide detective Steve Spingola. In 2010, Spingola published Predators on the Parkway, a 29-page magazine article that detailed his findings. Spingola proposed that the murders are the work of different killers, especially the slayings of Cathleen Thomas and Rebecca Dowski. Spingola believes the Thomas-Dowski crimes are directly linked to the deaths of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams who were found with their throats slashed in the Shenandoah National Park, 180 miles west of the Colonial Parkway, in 1996. =2010 note= In 2010, a note was discovered in a box taken years earlier from Annamaria Phelps' apartment. The note, which was undated and purportedly written by Phelps, indicated that she was to meet someone in a blue van at a rest stop. While the Virginia State Police claim the information in this note was previously examined, one of the state police investigators working during the 1989 Phelps-Lauer murders told a television reporter from WAVY-TV that he was \\"unaware of the existence of the note.\\"  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References Further reading * Category:1986 murders in the United States Category:Unsolved murders in the United States Category:Murder in Virginia Category:Unidentified serial killers Category:1987 murders in the United States Category:1988 murders in the United States Category:1989 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Virginia ","title":"Colonial Parkway murders"},{"id":"2358023","text":"Stuart Barnes (born 22 November 1962 in Grays, Essex) is a former English rugby union footballer, and now rugby commentator for Sky Sports. Barnes played fly-half for Newport RFC, Bristol, Bath; and represented England at international level.  Biography  Although born in Essex, he played his schoolboy international rugby for Wales Schools. Such was his speed and talent, he made the leap from the U15s to the U19s after one season, and became an ever-present (he didn't miss a schools international for four years between 1976 & 1980), also captaining the team on several occasions.

He graduated from Oxford with a third-class honours degree in history. = Club career = While at University, Barnes played club rugby for Newport RFC. He matriculated in 1981. Barnes later played for Bristol, including in the 1984 RFU final against Bath Rugby. After being on the losing side for Bristol in that final, he was to join Bath. He arrived at Bath aged 22: \\"disaffected with England and, with my volatile character, I could easily have drifted out of the game altogether.

Accounting Comprehensive income is defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, as ‚Äúthe change in equity [net assets] of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.‚Äù Comprehensive income is the sum of net income and other items that must bypass the income statement because they have not been realized, including items like an unrealized holding gain or loss from available for sale securities and foreign currency translation gains or losses.

Items included in comprehensive income, but not net income are reported under the accumulated other comprehensive income section of shareholder's equity. Financial analysis Comprehensive income attempts to measure the sum total of all operating and financial events that have changed the value of an owner's interest in a business. It is measured on a per-share basis to capture the effects of dilution and options. It cancels out the effects of equity transactions for which the owner would be indifferent: dividend payments, share buy-backs, and share issues at market value. It is calculated by reconciling the book value per-share from the start of the period to the end of the period.

He became a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1546. Graduating B.A. 1551‚Äì2, he became a fellow of Trinity in 1553, and graduated M.A. 1555 and B.D. 1562. In 1561 he was elected Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity, and next year master of Pembroke Hall, and regius professor of divinity. In the same year he was collated prebendary of St. Paul's, London, and in 1563 instituted rector of Boxworth, Cambridgeshire (resigned in 1576). About the same time he obtained a canonry at Ely. In 1564 he distinguished himself by his ability in the theological disputations before Queen Elizabeth at Cambridge, and his character was established as one of the ablest scholars and preachers in the university. He was created D.D. there in 1565, and later in the year was installed a canon of Westminster. In the succeeding year he was one of the Lent preachers at court and a preacher at St. Paul's Cross. After his appointment in April 1567 as dean of York he resigned his mastership at Pembroke, the regius professorship, and his canonries of Ely and Westminster. Subsequently, he was collated to prebends at York and Southwell. He was suggested as fit to succeed Edmund Grindal in the see of London in 1570, but his election was opposed by Archbishop Parker. An interesting letter to Burghley, dated 6 October 1573, is preserved at Hatfield, giving at length his opinions on prevailing differences in church government. He was suspected of leaning to the Puritans, and this led to a dispute with Archbishop Sandys, who in 1586 preferred a charge of thirteen articles against him. Hutton defended himself with spirit, and, though compelled to make submission, admitted nothing more than the use of violent and indiscreet expressions. On 9 June 1589 he was elected through Burghley's influence to the bishopric of Durham. On 11 December 1594, and in February 1594‚Äì5, he wrote beautiful and pathetic appeals to Burghley on behalf of Lady Margaret Neville, who had been condemned on account of the rebellion of her father, Charles, 6th earl of Westmoreland, and he was not only successful in his application for mercy, but gained a pension for the lady.

His courtesy to his prisoner was afterwards acknowledged by King James and by Sir Robert himself. One of his last public acts was to write a letter to Robert Cecil, Lord Cranborne, counselling a relaxation in the prosecution of the puritans. He died at Bishopthorpe on 16 January 1605‚Äì6, and was buried in York Minster. His monument is in the south aisle of the choir. He married in 1565 Catherine Fulmetby, or Fulmesby, who died soon after. In 1567 he married Beatrice, daughter of Sir Thomas Fincham. She died on 5 May 1582, and on 20 November following he married Frances, widow of Martin Bowes (died 1573), son of Sir Martin Bowes.Will of Frances, widow of Martin Bowes, daughter and heiress of Richard Scrope, Esq., Archaeologica Aeliana, 1861 (The archbishop's wife Frances left to her grandson Matthew Bowes her home in Coppergate, York, that she had purchased from \\"Parcivall Levett of York, merchant.\\") The archbishop left several children by the second marriage. Of these, Timothy Hutton, the eldest son, born 1569, was knighted in 1605, the year in which he was high sheriff of Yorkshire, and died in 1629; the second son was Sir Thomas Hutton of Popleton (d. 1620). The archbishop was blamed by some for granting leases of church lands to his children, which apparently considerably enriched them.

The story is a tragedy about the adulterous love between the Cornish knight Tristan (Tristram, etc.) and the Irish princess Iseult (Isolde, Yseult, etc.); while the details differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same. The narrative predates and most likely influenced the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has had a substantial impact on Western art and literature. Narratives of the legend The story and character of Tristan vary from author to author; even the spelling of his name varies a great deal, although \\"Tristan\\" is the most popular spelling. Nevertheless, there are two main traditions of the Tristan legend. The early tradition comprised the French romances of Thomas of Britain and B√©roul, two poets from the second half of the 12th century. Later traditions come from the vast Prose Tristan (c. 1240), which was markedly different from the earlier tales written by Thomas and B√©roul. John Duncan (1912)alt= After defeating the Irish knight Morholt, Tristan travels to Ireland to bring back the fair Iseult (also appearing under various spellings) for his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, to marry. Along the way, they ingest a love potion which causes the pair to fall madly in love. In the legend's courtly branch (see below), the potion's effects last a lifetime, but the potion's effects wane after three years in the common branch. In some versions, they ingest the potion accidentally; in others, the potion's maker instructs Iseult to share it with Mark, but she deliberately gives it to Tristan instead. Although Iseult marries Mark, she and Tristan are forced by the spell to seek one another, as lovers. The king's advisors repeatedly endeavour to have the pair tried for adultery, but the couple continually use trickery to preserve their fa√ßade of innocence. In B√©roul's version, the love potion eventually wears off, and the two lovers are free to make their own choice as to whether to continue their adulterous relationship. As with the Arthur‚ÄìLancelot‚ÄìGuinevere love triangle in the medieval courtly love motif, Tristan, King Mark, and Iseult of Ireland all love each other. Tristan honours and respects King Mark as his mentor and adopted father; Iseult is grateful that Mark is kind to her; and Mark loves Tristan as his son and Iseult as a wife. But every night, each has horrible dreams about the future. Tristan's uncle eventually learns of the affair and seeks to entrap his nephew and his bride. Also present is the endangerment of a fragile kingdom, the cessation of war between Ireland and Cornwall (Dumnonia). Mark acquires what seems proof of their guilt and resolves to punish them: Tristan by hanging and Iseult by burning at the stake, later lodging her in a leper colony. Tristan escapes on his way to the gallows, makes a miraculous leap from a chapel, and rescues Iseult. The lovers escape into the forest of Morrois and take shelter there until discovered by Mark. They make peace with Mark after Tristan's agreement to return Iseult of Ireland to Mark and leave the country. Tristan then travels to Brittany, where he marries (for her name and her beauty) Iseult of the White Hands, daughter of Hoel of Brittany and sister of Kahedin. =Association with King Arthur and demise= Rogelio de Egusquiza's Tristan and Isolt (Death) (1910) The earliest surviving versions already incorporate references to King Arthur and his court. The connection between Tristan and Iseult and the Arthurian legend was expanded over time, and sometime shortly after the completion of the Vulgate Cycle (the Lancelot-Grail) in the first quarter of the 13th century, two authors created the Prose Tristan, which fully establishes Tristan as a Knight of the Round Table who even participates in the Quest for the Holy Grail. The Prose Tristan became the common medieval tale of Tristan and Iseult that would provide the background for Thomas Malory, the English author who wrote Le Morte d'Arthur over two centuries later. left In the most popular variants of the Prose Tristan and the derived works, Tristan is mortally wounded by King Mark when he strikes Tristan, who is playing a harp for Iseult, with an enchanted lance that had been given to him by Morgan le Fay. The poetic versions of the Tristan legend offer a very different account of the hero's death. In Thomas' account, Tristan is wounded by a poisoned lance while attempting to rescue a young woman from six knights. Tristan sends his friend Kahedin to find Iseult of Ireland, the only person who can heal him. Tristan tells Kahedin to sail back with white sails if he is bringing Iseult, and black sails if he is not. Iseult agrees to return to Tristan with Kahedin, but Tristan's jealous wife, Iseult of the White Hands, lies to Tristan about the colour of the sails. Tristan dies of grief, thinking that Iseult has betrayed him, and Iseult dies swooning over his corpse. Some texts of the Prose Tristan use the traditional account of Tristan's death as found in the poetic versions. = Post-death = Genevi√®ve and Lancelot at the Tombs of Isolde and Tristan by alt= In French sources, such as those picked over in the English translation by Hilaire Belloc in 1903, it is stated that a thick bramble briar grows out of Tristan's grave, growing so much that it forms a bower and roots itself into Iseult's grave. It goes on that King Mark tries to have the branches cut three separate times, and each time the branches grow back and intertwine. This behaviour of briars would have been very familiar to medieval people who worked on the land. Later tellings sweeten this aspect of the story, by having Tristan's grave grow a briar, but Iseult's grave grow a rose tree, which then intertwine with each other. Further variants refine this aspect even more, with the two plants being said to have been hazel and honeysuckle. A few later stories even record that the lovers had a number of children. In some stories they produced a son and a daughter they named after themselves; these children survived their parents and had adventures of their own. In the French romance Ysaie le Triste (Ysaie the Sad), the eponymous hero is the son of Tristan and Iseult; he becomes involved with the fairy king Oberon and marries a girl named Martha, who bears him a son named Mark. Spanish Tristan el Joven also dealt with Tristan's son, here named Tristan of Leonis.N. J. Lacy (et al.). \\"Carta enviada por Hiseo la Brunda Tristan\\", \\"Repuesta de Tristan\\" from The New Arthurian Encyclopedia. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991. Origins and analogues There are many theories present about the origins of Tristanian legend, but historians disagree over which is the most accurate. = British = The mid-6th-century \\"Drustanus Stone\\" monument in Cornwall has an inscription seemingly referring to Drustan, son of Cunomorus (\\"Mark\\"). However, not all historians agree that the Drustan referred to is the archetype of Tristan. The inscription is now heavy eroded, but the earliest records of the stone, starting from the 16th century, all agree on some variation of \\"CIRVIVS\\" / \\"CIRUSIUS\\" as the name inscribed. Only in the late 19th century was it first read as some variation of \\"DRUSTANUS\\", possibly an optimistic reading, corresponding to the 19th century popular revival in medieval romance. A 2014 study, using 3D scanning techniques, supported the initial \\"CI\\" reading rather than the backwards facing \\"D\\". There are references to March ap Meichion (\\"Mark\\") and Trystan in the Welsh Triads, in some of the gnomic poetry, the Mabinogion stories, and in the 11th-century hagiography of Illtud. A character called Drystan appears as one of King Arthur's advisers at the end of The Dream of Rhonabwy, an early 13th-century tale in the Welsh prose collection known as the Mabinogion. Iseult is listed along with other great men and women of Arthur's court in another, much earlier Mabinogion tale, Culhwch and Olwen.Jeffrey Gantz (translator), Culhwch and Olwen, from The Mabinogion, Penguin, 1976. =Irish= Possible Irish antecedents to the Tristan legend have received much scholarly attention. An ill-fated triant√°n an ghr√° or love triangle features into a number of Irish works, most notably in the text called T√≥raigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghr√°inne (The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr√°inne). In the story, the aging Fionn mac Cumhaill takes the young princess, Gr√°inne, to be his wife. At the betrothal ceremony, however, she falls in love with Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, one of Fionn's most trusted warriors. Gr√°inne gives a sleeping potion to all present but him, eventually convincing him to elope with her. The fugitive lovers are then pursued all over Ireland by the Fianna. Another Irish analogue is Sc√©la Cano meic Gartn√°in, preserved in the 14th-century Yellow Book of Lecan. In this tale, Cano is an exiled Scottish king who accepts the hospitality of King Marcan of Ui Maile. His young wife, Credd, drugs all present, and then convinces Cano to be her lover. They try to keep a tryst while at Marcan's court, but are frustrated by courtiers. Eventually Credd kills herself and Cano dies of grief. In the Ulster Cycle there is the text Clann Uisnigh or Deirdre of the Sorrows in which Naoise mac Usnech falls for Deirdre, who was imprisoned by King Conchobar mac Nessa due to a prophecy that Ulster would plunge into civil war due to men fighting for her beauty. Conchobar had pledged to marry Deirdre himself in time to avert war, and takes his revenge on Clann Uisnigh. The death of Naoise and his kin leads many Ulstermen to defect to Connacht, including Conchobar's stepfather and trusted ally Fergus mac R√≥ich, eventually precipitating the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge. =Persian and Classical= Some scholars suggest that the 11th-century Persian story Vis and RƒÅmin must have been the model for the Tristan legend because the similarities are too great to be coincidental.Stewart Gregory (translator), Thomas of Britain, Roman de Tristan, New York: Garland Publishers, 1991. Fakhr al-Dƒ´n GurgƒÅnƒ´, and Dick Davis. 2008. Vis & Ramin. Washington, DC: Mage publishers. The evidence for the Persian origin of Tristan and Iseult is very circumstantialGrimbert, Joan T. 1995. Tristan and Isolde: a casebook. New York: Garland Pub. and different theories have been suggested how this Persian story might have reached the West. Some suggested story-telling exchanges during the Crusades in Syrian court, and through minstrels who had free access to both Crusader and Saracen camps in the Holy Land.Grimbert, Joan T. 1995. Tristan and Isolde: a casebook. p. 21. Some believe Ovid's Pyramus and Thisbe, as well as the story of Ariadne at Naxos might have also contributed to the development of the Tristan legend. The sequence in which Tristan and Iseult die and become interwoven trees also parallels Ovid's love story of Baucis and Philemon in which two lovers are transformed in death into two different trees sprouting from the same trunk. However this also occurs in the saga of Deidre of the Sorrows making the link more tenuous and ignores the (now lost) oral traditions of preliterate societies, relying only on written records which are known to have been damaged ‚Äì especially during the Dissolution of the Monasteries ‚Äì during the development of modern nation states such as England and France. Courtly and common branches of early Tristan literature Yseult by Gaston Bussi√®re (early 20th century) =Courtly branch= The earliest representation of what scholars name the \\"courtly\\" branch of the Tristan legend is in the work of Thomas of Britain, dating from 1173. Only ten fragments of his Tristan poem, representing six manuscripts, have ever been located: the manuscripts in Turin and Strassburg are now lost, leaving two in Oxford, one in Cambridge and one in Carlisle. In his text, Thomas names another trouv√®re who also sang of Tristan, though no manuscripts of this earlier version have been discovered. There is also a passage telling how Iseult wrote a short lai out of grief that sheds light on the development of an unrelated legend concerning the death of a prominent troubadour, as well as the composition of lais by noblewomen of the 12th century. The next essential text for knowledge of the courtly branch of the Tristan legend is the abridged translation of Thomas made by Brother Robert at the request of King Haakon Haakonson of Norway in 1227. King Haakon had wanted to promote Angevin-Norman culture at his court, and so commissioned the translation of several French Arthurian works. The Nordic version presents a complete, direct narrative of the events in Thomas' Tristan, with the telling omission of his numerous interpretive diversions. It is the only complete representative of the courtly branch in its formative period.P. Schach, The Saga of Tristram and Isond, University of Nebraska Press, 1973 Preceding the work of Brother Robert chronologically is the Tristan and Isolt of Gottfried von Strassburg, written circa 1211‚Äì1215. The poem was Gottfried's only known work, and was left incomplete due to his death with the retelling reaching half-way through the main plot. The poem was later completed by authors such as Heinrich von Freiberg and Ulrich von T√ºrheim, but with the \\"common\\" branch of the legend as the ideal source.Norris J. Lacy et al. \\"Gottfried von Strassburg\\" from The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, New York: Garland, 1991. =Common branch= The earliest representation of the \\"common branch\\" is B√©roul's Le Roman de Tristan, the first part of which is generally dated between 1150 and 1170, and the latter part between 1181 and 1190. The branch is so named due to its representation of an earlier non-chivalric, non-courtly, tradition of story- telling, making it more reflective of the Dark Ages than of the refined High Middle Ages. In this respect, they are similar to Layamon's Brut and the Perlesvaus. As with Thomas' works, knowledge of B√©roul's is limited. There were a few substantial fragments of his works discovered in the 19th century, and the rest was reconstructed from later versions.\\"Early French Tristan Poems\\", from Norris J. Lacy (editor), Arthurian Archives, Cambridge, England; Rochester, NY: D.S. Brewer, 1998. Beroul's version is the oldest known version of the Tristan romances and is commonly considered to come the closest to presenting all of the raw events in the romance exactly as they are, with no explanation or modifications. Therefore, Beroul's version is an archetype for later \\"common branch\\" editions. Federick, Alan.\\"Introduction.\\" The Romance of Tristan: The Tale of Tristan's Madness.Translated by Alan S. Fedrick, Penguin Classics, 1970. A more substantial illustration of the common branch is the German version by Eilhart von Oberge. Eilhart was popular, but pales in comparison with the later Gottfried. One aspect of the common branch that differentiates them significantly from the courtly branch is their depiction of the lovers' time in exile from Mark's court. While the courtly branch describe Tristan and Iseult as sheltering in a \\"Cave of Lovers\\" and living in happy seclusion, thus keeping with the tradition of courtly and chivalric writing, the common branches emphasize the extreme suffering that Tristan and Iseult endure. In the common branch, the exile is a true punishment that highlights the couple's departure from courtly norms and emphasizes the impossibility of their romance. Kelly, Molly Robinson. ‚ÄúAfter the Potion.‚Äù The Hero‚Äôs Place: Medieval Literary Traditions of Space and Belonging. Washington DC, Catholic University of America Press, 2009, pp. 227-284. =Questions regarding a common source= The French medievalist Joseph B√©dier thought all the Tristan legends could be traced to a single original poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the \\"Ur-Tristan\\", and wrote his still- popular Romance of Tristan and Iseult as an attempt to reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, common branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, B√©dier relied heavily on Eilhart, B√©roul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. A new English translation of B√©dier's Roman de Tristan et Iseut (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by Hilaire Belloc, first published in 1913, it was published in 1958 as a Caedmon Audio recording read by Claire BloomTrove, National Library of Australia and republished in 2005. Other versions Tristan and Iseult on their way to Cornwall, a medieval miniature by alt= =French= Contemporary with B√©roul and Thomas, Marie de France presented a Tristan episode in one of her lais: \\"Chevrefoil\\". It concerns another of Tristan's clandestine returns to Cornwall in which the banished hero signals his presence to Iseult by means of an inscription on a branch of a hazelnut tree placed on the road she will travel. The title refers to the symbiosis of the honeysuckle and hazelnut tree which die when separated, as do Tristan and Iseult: \\"Ni vous sans moi, ni moi sans vous.\\" (\\"Neither you without me, nor me without you.\\") This episode is reminiscent of one in the courtly branch when Tristan uses wood shavings put in a stream as signals to meet in the garden of Mark's palace. There are also two 12th-century Folies Tristan, Old French poems identified as the Berne and the Oxford versions, which relate Tristan's return to Marc's court under the guise of a madman. Besides their own importance as episodic additions to the Tristan story and masterpieces of narrative structure, these relatively short poems significantly contributed to restoring the missing parts of B√©roul's and Thomas' incomplete texts.Norris J. Lacy (editor) Arthurian Archives: Early French Tristan Poems. Cambridge (England); Rochester, NY : D.S. Brewer, 1998. Chr√©tien de Troyes claims to have written a Tristan story, though no part of it has ever been found. He mentions this in the introduction to Clig√®s, a romance that many see as a kind of anti-Tristan with a happy ending. Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chr√©tien to write Clig√®s ‚Äì a story with no Celtic antecedent ‚Äì to make amends.N. J. Lacy (et al.). Cliges from The New Arthurian Encyclopedia. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991. After B√©roul and Thomas, the most important development in French Tristaniana is a complex grouping of texts known broadly as the Prose Tristan. Extremely popular in the 13th and 14th century, the narratives of these lengthy versions vary in detail from manuscript to manuscript. Modern editions run twelve volumes for the long version, which includes Tristan's participation in the Quest for the Holy Grail, or five volumes for a shorter version without the Grail Quest.Before any editions of the Prose Tristan were attempted, scholars were dependent on an extended summary and analysis of all the manuscripts by Eilert L√∂seth in 1890 (republished in 1974). Of the modern editions, the long version is made up of two editions: Ren√©e L. Curtis, ed. Le Roman de Tristan en prose, vols. 1‚Äì3 (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1963‚Äì1985) and Philippe M√©nard, exec. ed. Le Roman de Tristan en Prose, vols. 1‚Äì9 (Geneva: Droz, 1987‚Äì1997). Curtis' edition of a simple manuscript (Carpentras 404) covers Tristan's ancestry and the traditional legend up to Tristan's madness. However, the massive amount of manuscripts in existence dissuaded other scholars from attempting what Curtis had done until M√©nard hit upon the idea of using multiple teams of scholars to tackle the infamous Vienna 2542 manuscript. His edition follows from Curtis' and ends with Tristan's death and the first signs of Arthur's fall. Richard Trachsler is currently preparing an edition of the \\"continuation\\" of the Prose Tristan. The shorter version, which contains no Grail Quest, is published by Jo√´l Blanchard in five volumes. It had a great influence on later medieval literature, and inspired parts of the Post-Vulgate Cycle and the Roman de Palamedes. =English= The earliest complete source of the Tristan material in English was Sir Tristrem, a romance of some 3344 lines written circa 1300. It is preserved in the famous Auchinleck manuscript at the National Library of Scotland. The narrative largely follows the courtly branch tradition. As is true with many medieval English adaptations of French Arthuriana, the poem's artistic achievement can only be described as average, though some critics have tried to rehabilitate it, claiming it is a parody. Its first editor, Walter Scott, provided a sixty line ending to the story, which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition.Alan Lupak (editor). Lancelot of the Laik and Sir Tristrem. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications. 1994. The only other medieval handling of the Tristan legend in English is Thomas Malory's The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyones, a shortened \\"translation\\" of the French Prose Tristan, included in his complication Le Morte d'Arthur. Since the Winchester Manuscript surfaced in 1934, there has been much scholarly debate whether the Tristan narrative, like all the episodes in Le Morte d'Arthur, was originally intended to be an independent piece or part of a larger work. =Italian and Spanish= Giovanni dal Ponte's Two couples - Paris and Helen, Tristan and Iseult (1410s) In Italy, there were many cantari, or oral poems performed in the public square, either about Tristan or frequently referencing him. They included Cantari di Tristano, Due Tristani Quando Tristano e Lancielotto combattiero al petrone di Merlino, Ultime imprese e morte Tristano, and Vendetta che fe Messer Lanzelloto de la Morte di Messer Tristano, among others. There are also four differing versions of the Prose Tristan in medieval Italy, most named after their place of composition or library in which they are currently to be found: Tristano Panciaticchiano, Tristano Riccardiano, and Tristano Veneto. The exception to this is the Tavola Ritonda. In the first third of the 14th century, Arcipreste de Hita wrote his version of the Tristan story, Carta enviada por Hiseo la Brunda a Trist√°n. Respuesta de Trist√°n is a unique 15th-century romance written in the form of imaginary letters between the two lovers. Libro del muy esforzado caballero Don Trist√°n de Leon√≠s y de sus grandes hechos en armas, a Spanish reworking of the Prose Tristan, was first published in Valladolid in 1501. =Nordic, Dutch and Welsh= The popularity of Brother Robert's version spawned a unique parody, Saga Af Tristram ok √çsodd, as well as the poem Tristrams kv√¶√∞i. In the collection of Old Norse prose-translations of Marie de France's lais ‚Äì called Strengleikar (Stringed Instruments) ‚Äì two lais with Arthurian content have been preserved, one of them being the \\"Chevrefoil\\", translated as \\"Geitarlauf\\". von Rudolph, Meissner (trans.), Die Strengleikar : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der altnordischen Prosalitteratur (Halle a.S : M. Niemeyer, 1902). By the 19th century, scholars had found Tristan legends spread across the Nordic world, from Denmark to the Faroe Islands. These stories, however, diverged greatly from their medieval precursors. In one Danish ballad, for instance, Tristan and Iseult are made brother and sister. Other unlikely innovations occur in two popular Danish chapbooks of the late 18th-century Tristans saga ok Inionu and En tragoedisk Historie om den √¶dle og tappre Tistrand, in which Iseult is made the princess of India. The popularity of these chapbooks inspired Icelandic poets Sigur√∞ur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞ and N√≠els J√≥nsson to write r√≠mur, long verse narratives, inspired by the Tristan legend.N. J. Lacy (et al.). Tristan from The New Arthurian Encyclopedia. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991. A 158-line fragment of a Dutch version (ca. 1250) of Thomas of Britain's Tristan exists. It is being kept in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, Series nova 3968. A short Tristan narrative, perhaps related to the B√©roul text, exists in six Welsh manuscripts dating from the late 16th to the mid 17th century.The Tristan Legend Hill. Leeds England: Leeds Medieval Studies. 1973. =Slavic= A 13th-century verse romance exists in Czech, based on the German Tristan poems by Gottfried, Heinrich and Eilhart. It is the only known verse representative of the Tristan story in a Slavic language.N. J. Lacy (et al.). Czech Arthurian Literature from The New Arthurian Encyclopedia. New York : Garland Publishing, 1991. The Old Belarusian prose Povest o Tryshchane represents the furthest eastern advance of the legend, and, composed in the 1560s, is considered by some critics to be the last \\"medieval\\" Tristan or Arthurian text period. Its lineage goes back to the Tristano Veneto. Venice, at that time, controlled large parts of the Serbo-Croatian language area, engendering a more active literary and cultural life there than in most of the Balkans during this period. The manuscript of the Povest states that it was translated from a (lost) Serbian intermediary. Scholars assume that the legend must have journeyed from Venice, through its Balkan colonies, finally reaching a last outpost in this Slavic language. Art Tristan and Isolde by Hugues Merle (c. 1870) The Tristan story was represented in several art media, from ivory mirror-cases to the 13th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt. Many of the manuscripts with literary versions are illuminated with miniatures. Later, the legend became a popular subject for Romanticist painters of the late 19th and early 20th century. Modern works =Literature= In English, the Tristan story suffered the same fate as the Matter of Britain generally. After being mostly ignored for about three centuries, there was a renaissance of original Arthurian literature, mostly narrative verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tristan material in this revival included Alfred Tennyson's The Last Tournament, one of his Idylls of the King; Matthew Arnold's Tristram and Iseult. Another Victorian work was Algernon Charles Swinburne's epic poem Tristram of Lyonesse. Thomas Hardy's The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse is a one-act play which was published in 1923 (the book includes an imaginary drawing of the castle at the period).Hardy, Thomas (1923) The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse. London: Macmillan; two drawings by Hardy reproduced as plates Rutland Boughton's opera The Queen of Cornwall (1924) was based on Thomas Hardy's play. After World War II, most Tristan texts were in the form of prose novels or short stories: * The Cornish writer Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch (\\"Q\\") started Castle Dor, a retelling of the Tristan and Iseult myth in modern circumstances with an innkeeper in the role of King Mark, his wife as Iseult and a Breton onion-seller as Tristan, the plot set in \\"Troy\\", his name for his home town of Fowey. The book was left unfinished at Quiller-Couch's death and was completed many years later, in 1962, by Daphne du Maurier. *Rosemary Sutcliff also wrote two early adult/children's novels based on the story of Tristan and Iseult. The first, Tristan and Iseult, is a retelling of the story for young adults and was first published in 1971. It received the Boston-Globe Horn Book Award in 1972, and was runner-up for the 1972 Carnegie Medal. It is set primarily in Cornwall in the southern peninsula of Britain. The story appears again as a chapter of her later Arthurian novel, The Sword and the Circle (1981). *Novelist Thomas Berger retold the story of Tristan and Isolde in his 1978 interpretation of Arthurian legend, Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel. * Dee Morrison Meaney wrote Iseult (1985) which tells the story from Iseult's perspective. There is a focus on the magic side to the story and how the coming of the Saxons meant the end of the druidic tradition and magical creatures. *Diana L. Paxson's 1988 novel The White Raven tells the tale of Tristan and Iseult, called in her book Drustan and Esseilte, from the perspective of Iseult's handmaiden Brangien (\\"Branwen\\"), who was mentioned in various of the medieval stories. *Joseph B√©dier's Romance of Tristan and Iseult is quoted as a source by John Updike in the afterword to his 1994 novel Brazil about the lovers Trist√£o and Isabel. *Bernard Cornwell includes a \\"historical\\" interpretation of the legend as a side story in Enemy of God: A Novel of Arthur, a 1996 entry in The Warlord Chronicles series. *Rosalind Miles wrote a trilogy about Tristan and Isolde: The Queen of the Western Isle (2002), The Maid of the White Hands (2003), and The Lady of the Sea (2004). *Nancy McKenzie wrote a book Prince of Dreams: A Tale of Tristan and Essylte as part of her Arthurian series in 2003. * In Bengali literature the story has been depicted by author Sunil Gangopadhyay in the novel Sonali Dukkho. * In Harry Turtledove's alternate history Ruled Britannia, Christopher Marlowe (who lives longer in the novel's timeline than he did in our history) writes a play called Yseult and Tristan to compete with his friend William Shakespeare's immensely popular Hamlet. No details of the play are given. =Music= Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde celebrated in a 1933 German stamp In 1832, Gaetano Donizetti references this story in his opera L'elisir d'amore as the character of Adina sings the story to the ensemble, inspiring Nemorino to ask the charlatan Dulcamara for the magic elixir. Premiered in 1865, Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde depicts Tristan as a doomed romantic figure, while Isolde fulfils Wagner's quintessential feminine r√¥le as the redeeming woman. Twentieth-century composers also used the legend (often with Wagnerian overtones) in their compositions. Olivier Messiaen built his Turangal√Æla-Symphonie around the story. Hans Werner Henze's Tristan borrowed freely from the Wagnerian version as well as retellings of the legend. *Swiss composer Frank Martin wrote a chamber opera Le vin herb√© between 1938‚Äì1940 after being influenced by Wagner. *Blind Guardian, a power metal band from Germany, also has a song inspired by Tristan and Iseult's story, \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\", from their A Night at the Opera album. *Colin Meloy's former band Tarkio have a song entitled \\"Tristan and Iseult\\" from their Sea Songs for Landlocked Sailers ep. *Patrick Wolf, English singer and songwriter, has a song about the Tristan and Iseult legend: \\"Tristan\\" from his second album Wind in the Wires. *Inspired by Thomas Hardy's play The Famous Tragedy of The Queen of Cornwall the English composer Rutland Boughton composed the music-drama The Queen of Cornwall. The first performance took place at the Glastonbury Festival in 1924. Already famous for \\"The Immortal Hour\\" and \\"Bethlehem\\", Boughton's growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the Tristram and Isolde legend. Feeling that Hardy's play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright's permission to import a handful of lyrics from his earlier published poetical works. The result is an altogether impressive and effective work, thought by many to be Boughton's masterpiece in this genre. In 2010 it was recorded on the Dutton Epoch label, in which Ronald Corp conducts the New London Orchestra, members of the London Chorus and with soloists Neal Davies (King Mark), Heather Shipp (Queen Iseult), Jacques Imbrailo (Sir Tristam) and Joan Rodgers (Iseult of Brittany). =Film and television= The story has also been adapted into film many times. * The earliest is probably the 1909 French film Tristan et Yseult, an early, silent version of the story. This was followed by another French film of the same name two years later, which offered a unique addition to the story. Here, it is Tristan's jealous slave Rosen who tricks the lovers into drinking the love potion, then denounces them to Mark. Mark has pity on the two lovers, but they commit double suicide anyway. A third silent French version appeared in 1920, and follows the legend fairly closely. * One of the most celebrated and controversial Tristan films was 1943's L'√âternel Retour (The Eternal Return), directed by Jean Delannoy (screenplay by Jean Cocteau). It is a contemporary retelling of the story with a man named Patrice in the Tristan role fetching a wife for his friend Marke. However, an evil dwarf tricks them into drinking a love potion, and the familiar plot ensues. The film was made in France during the Vichy regime, and elements in the movie reflect Nazi ideology, with the beautiful, blonde hero and heroine off-set by the Untermensch dwarf. The dwarf is given a larger role than in most interpretations of the legend; its conniving rains havoc on the lovers, much like the Jews of Nazi stereotypes. * This was followed by the avant-garde French film Tristan et Iseult in 1972 and the Irish Lovespell, featuring Nicholas Clay as Tristan and Kate Mulgrew as Iseult; coincidentally, Clay went on to play Lancelot in John Boorman's epic Excalibur. * The 1970 Spanish film Tristana is only tangentially related to the Tristan story. The Tristan role is assumed by the female character Tristana, who is forced to care for her aging uncle, Don Lope, though she wishes to marry Horacio. * The popular German film Fire and Sword premiered in 1981. It was very accurate to the story, though it cut the Iseult of Brittany subplot. * French director Fran√ßois Truffaut adapted the subject to modern times for his 1981 film La Femme d'√† c√¥t√© (The Woman Next Door), while 1988's In the Shadow of the Raven transported the characters to medieval Iceland. Here, Trausti and Isolde are warriors from rival tribes who come into conflict when Trausti kills the leader of Isolde's tribe, but a local bishop makes peace and arranges their marriage. * Animatee TV series Trist√°n & Isolda: La Leyenda Olvidada was aired in Spain and France in 1998. * Bollywood director Subhash Ghai transfers the story to modern India and the United States in his 1997 musical Pardes. The Indian American Kishorilal (Amrish Puri) raises his orphaned nephew Arjun (Shahrukh Khan). Eventually, Pardes sends Arjun back to India to lure the beautiful Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary) as a bride for his selfish, shallow son Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). Arjun falls for Ganga, and struggles to remain loyal to his cousin and beloved uncle. * The 2002 French animated film Tristan et Iseut is a bowdlerized version of the traditional tale aimed at a family audience. * The legend was given a relatively high- budget treatment with 2006's Tristan & Isolde, produced by Tony Scott and Ridley Scott, written by Dean Georgaris, directed by Kevin Reynolds, and starring James Franco and Sophia Myles. In this version, Tristan is a Cornish warrior who was raised by Lord Marke after his parents were killed at a young age. In a fight with the Irish, Tristan defeats Morholt, the Irish King's second, but is poisoned in the process. The poison dulls all his senses and his companions believe him dead. He is sent off in a boat meant to cremate a dead body. Isolde, dismayed over her unwilling betrothal to Morholt, leaves her home and finds Tristan on the Irish coast. She tells Tristan that she is called Bragnae, which is the name of her maidservant. Isolde takes care of him and hides him from her father. They spend long days together and come to care for each other. Eventually they confess their feelings for one another and consummate their love. Tristan's boat is discovered and Isolde's father begins a search for a Cornish warrior in Ireland. Isolde helps Tristan escape but cannot leave with him. Tristan returns to England and learns of a tournament between the Cornish tribes for the hand of the Irish princess named Isolde. He agrees to participate to win the princess as Marke's wife. After winning the tournament and discovering that the princess is the woman who had rescued him, Tristan is devastated but decides to bury his feelings, because her marriage to Marke would end decades of bloodshed. Eventually Tristan cannot stand to be apart from Isolde any longer and they start their adulterous relationship. Later, they are found out but Marke frees them after hearing their story. Tristan, however, returns to defend Marke against a rebellion. He dies a hero, with Isolde at his side.

It began construction on its permanent building in 1929, located across the street from First Unitarian Church of Chicago and designed by the same architect. Lombard College building, from an 1876 catalog Lombard College was a Universalist institution in Galesburg, Illinois, founded in 1853. From the 1880s to 1913 it was the seat of the Ryder School of Divinity. When the college closed in 1930, the Lombard charter was transferred to Meadville Theological School in Chicago. bringing with it Lombard's privilege of a tax exemption, \\"one of only three in Illinois granting full tax-exempt status in perpetuity for all college-owned property.\\" The combined institution became Meadville Lombard Theological School. =After 2000= In the first decade of the 2000s, the school implemented cost-cutting measures as its endowment declined in value from $18 million to $12 million, and funding from the Unitarian Universalist Association was reduced. In 2005 Meadville Lombard made public their decision to hold merger talks with the other Unitarian Universalist seminary in the United States, Starr King School for the Ministry, but in July 2006 it was decided that a merger would not be in the best interest of the seminaries. Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership In June 2010, Meadville Lombard and Andover Newton Theological School in Newton, Massachusetts, affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the United Church of Christ, announced plans to create a \\"new university-style institution\\" based at Andover Newton's campus with an interfaith model for theological education. Meadville Lombard would have become the Unitarian Universalist college in the new theological university. The two schools, Meadville Lombard and Andover Newton, announced they were seeking additional partners for the proposed institution. They announced their intention to form the new university as a legal entity by June 15, 2011, but the two institutions withdrew from the plan in April 2011, citing issues related to governance and finances. In 2011, the seminary's Hyde Park buildings were sold and the school relocated to the Spertus Institute building in Chicago's downtown Loop. Academics Meadville Lombard Theological School is one of two Unitarian Universalist seminaries (the other being Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California) and offers the following graduate degree programs: Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Religion, and the Master of Arts in Leadership Studies (with the option to add a concentration in Lay Community Ministry). Campus The seminary's historic 16,000 sq. ft. Collegiate Gothic style building was erected in 1933 on 5701 S. Woodlawn Avenue, across from First Unitarian Church of Chicago and near the campus of the University of Chicago in Hyde Park. In 2011 the University of Chicago purchased the building and hired Kliment Halsband Architects to turn it into a home for the Neubauer Family Collegium for Culture and Society.http://www.universitybusiness.com/news/university-chicago-selects- kliment-halsband-architects-design-home-neubauer-collegium Meadville Lombard is now located in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago, sharing space with the Spertus Institute of Jewish Learning and Leadership.

It portrays the conflict of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey and Arnold Epstein, one of many privates enlisted in the military stationed in Biloxi, Mississippi, seen through the eyes of Eugene Jerome, one of the other soldiers. This play is the second chapter in what is known as his Eugene trilogy, following Brighton Beach Memoirs and preceding Broadway Bound, and is the only one in which Eugene is not the central character. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play, and Barry Miller won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance as Arnold Epstein. Plot overview The story begins with 18-year-old Eugene Morris Jerome from Brooklyn, who is drafted into the United States Army during World War II and is sent to Biloxi, Mississippi for basic training. There he meets a diverse assortment of soldiers, including the gentle and intelligent Arnold Epstein, who is the play's central figure. The piece portrays Epstein's struggle for power with middle-aged, hard-drinking platoon leader Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey. In a memorable scene, Epstein manages to force Toomey to perform two hundred push-ups in front of the platoon.

He was the wealthiest man in Britain during the latter part of his life. He remains a controversial figure for his role in the Highland Clearances. Background Sutherland was the eldest son of the Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, by his second wife, Lady Louisa, daughter of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgwater. Granville Leveson- Gower, 1st Earl Granville, was his half-brother. He was educated at Westminster and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated MA in 1777. Earlier political career Sutherland sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1779 to 1784 and for Staffordshire from 1787 to 1799. The latter year he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Gower. Ambassador during French Revolution Between 1790 and 1792 he was Ambassador to France. Gower was appointed ambassador in Paris in June 1790 at the age of 32. Due to Louis XVI being under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace, Gower was unable to become 'an ornament at Versailles', i.e. was unable to work closely with the royal family. Gower was scarcely better equipped to handle the complexity of the French Revolution than his predecessor, the Duke of Dorset. He had no previous experience of diplomacy. Gower's main priority in Paris was to provide news from the French court back to Britain, however trivial. Though Gower also reported some popular 'disturbances', he had little comprehension of the broader political climate. On 10 August 1792 an insurrection by the newly established Paris Revolutionary Commune drove the royal family from the Tuileries and three days later Louis was arrested and imprisoned in the Temple fortress. Britain broke off diplomatic relations in protest. The closure of the British embassy meant that the intelligence operations could no longer be run from it, resulting in Britain replacing the ambassador with Captain George Monro, removing Gower from diplomacy in France.Andrew, Christopher. Secret World: A History of Intelligence. New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2018. Later political career After his return to Britain he declined the posts of Lord Steward of the Household and Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. However, in 1799 he accepted the office of joint Postmaster General, which he retained until 1801. Sutherland played an important part in the downfall of Henry Addington's administration in 1804, after which he changed political allegiance from the Tory to the Whig party. After 1807 he played little part in politics, although late in life he supported Catholic Emancipation and the 1832 Reform Act. From 1794 to 1801, Sutherland was Colonel of the Staffordshire Volunteer Cavalry, an early form of yeomanry regiment. Sutherland also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire from 1799 to 1801 and Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland from 1794 to 1830. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor in 1790, a Knight of the Garter in 1806 and was created Duke of Sutherland on 28 January 1833. Wealth The Leveson-Gower family owned extensive lands in Staffordshire, Shropshire and Yorkshire. In 1803 Sutherland also succeeded to the vast estates of his maternal uncle Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, which included the Bridgewater Canal and a major art collection including much of the Orleans Collection; both Gower and his uncle had been members of the consortium which brought it to London for dispersal. According to the will of the Duke of Bridgewater, these passed on the death of the first Duke of Sutherland to his third son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (see below). This inheritance brought him great wealth. Sutherland is estimated to have been the wealthiest man of the 19th-century, surpassing even Nathan Rothschild. The precise value of his estate at death is unknown, as it was simply classed as 'upper value'. He was described by Charles Greville as a \\"leviathan of wealth\\" and \\"...the richest individual who ever died\\". In 1837 he purchased Stafford House (now Lancaster House), which was the London residence of the dukes of Sutherland until 1912. Development of Sutherland and Highland clearances Sutherland and his wife remain controversial figures for their role in carrying out the Highland Clearances, where thousands of tenants were evicted and rehoused in coastal crofts as part of a program of improvement. The larger clearances in Sutherland were undertaken between 1811 and 1820. In 1811 parliament passed a bill granting half the expenses of building roads in northern Scotland, on the provision that landowners paid for the other half. The following year Sutherland commenced building roads and bridges in the county, which up to that point had been virtually non-existent. Appalled by the poor living conditions of his tenants and influenced by social and economic theories of the day as well as consulting widely on the subject, he and his wife (to whom much of the proprietorial oversight of the estate had been delegated) became convinced that subsistence farming in the interior of Sutherland could not be sustained in the long-term. Much higher rents could be obtained from letting land for extensive sheep farms - so providing a much better income from the estate. The Sutherland Estate management had had plans for clearance for some years, with some clearance activity in 1772 when Lady Sutherland was still a child. However, a shortage of money stopped these plans from progressing to any greater degree ‚Äì a situation that continued after her marriage to Leveson- Gower. However, when he inherited the vast wealth of the Duke of Bridgewater, plans could proceed ‚Äì and Leveson-Gower was happy for large amounts of his wealth to be spent on the changes to the Sutherland Estate. Though unusual for the time, much of the oversight of the estate management was delegated to Lady Sutherland, who took a keen interest in the estate, travelling to Dunrobin Castle most summers and engaging in a continuous exchange of correspondence with the factor and James Loch, the Stafford estate commissioner. The first of the new wave of clearances involved relocations from Assynt to coastal villages with the plan that farmers could take up fishing. The next eviction, in the Strath of Kildonan in 1813, was met with opposition and a 6 week long confrontation that was resolved by calling out the army and the estate making some concessions to those who were evicted. In 1814, one of the estate's factors, Patrick Sellar, was supervising clearances in Strathnaver when the roof timbers of a house were set on fire (to prevent the house being reoccupied after the eviction) with, allegedly, an elderly and bedridden woman still inside. The woman was rescued, but died 6 days later. The local law officer, Robert Mackid, was an enemy of Sellar and started taking witness statements so that Sellar could be prosecuted. The case went to trial in 1816 and Sellar was acquitted. The publicity arising from the trial was not welcome to the Sutherlands. Sellar was replaced as factor and further, larger clearances continued in 1818 to 1820. Despite efforts to avoid press comment, in 1819 the Observer newspaper ran the headline: \\"the Devastation of Sutherland\\", reporting the burning of roof timbers of large numbers of houses cleared at the same time. Monuments In 1837 a large monument, known locally as the Mannie, was erected on Ben Bhraggie near Golspie to commemorate the Duke's life.\\" The First Duke of Sutherland\\" golspie.org.uk Retrieved 1 February 2008. The existence of this statue has been the subject of some controversy‚Äîin 1994, Sandy Lindsay, a former Scottish National Party councillor from Inverness proposed its demolition. He later altered his plan, asking permission from the local council to relocate the statue and replace it with plaques telling the story of the Clearances. Lindsay proposed moving the statue to the grounds of Dunrobin Castle, after the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles declined his offer to take it. There was a failed attempt by vandals to topple the statue in November 2011. A BBC news report of this incident quoted a local person saying that few people wished the statue removed; instead they saw it as an important reminder of history. As of January 2017, however, the statue still stands. There is also a monument to Levenson-Gower in Shropshire. The Lilleshall Monument, built in 1833, is a 70-foot (21 m) high obelisk, a local landmark visible for some distance around which stands on top of Lilleshall Hill. The hill is within the original estates of the Levenson family acquired on the dissolution of Lilleshall Abbey. The mineral wealth they accidentally inherited there, relatively shallow deposits of Iron and coal in the Lillishall, Donnington and Wombridge area, was a source of great wealth to him. Working conditions of the time were primitive with serious occupational injuries and loss of life being common. These people are not commemorated. The family left no significant charitable institutions in the area such as schools, hospitals or almshouses. There is also a monument erected in the Trentham Gardens Estate, Trentham, Staffordshire. Family Sutherland married Elizabeth Sutherland, 19th Countess of Sutherland, daughter of William Sutherland, 18th Earl of Sutherland and the former Mary Maxwell, on 4 September 1785. They had four surviving children: *George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland,(11 Aug 1786‚Äì1861) *Lady Charlotte Sophia Leveson-Gower (c. 1788‚Äì1870), married Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk and had issue. *Lady Elizabeth Mary Leveson-Gower (1797‚Äì1891), married Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster and had issue. *Francis Leveson-Gower (later Egerton) 1st Earl of Ellesmere, (1800‚Äì1857) Eleven years after becoming enfeebled by a paralytic stroke, Sutherland died at Dunrobin Castle in July 1833, aged 75, and was buried at Dornoch Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George. The Duchess of Sutherland died in January 1839, aged 73, and was also succeeded by her eldest son, George. Ancestry Legacy Due to his controversial role in the Sutherland Clearances, the \\"Mannie\\" statue to the Duke in Golspie, Sutherland has been subject to repeated vandalism. There are several well-known Gaelic songs mocking the duke personally. Perhaps the most famous of these is ' (Mackay Country or Northern Sutherland, a region hit hard by the Clearances), written by Ewen Robertson, who became known as the \\"Bard of the Clearances.\\" References External links * Category:1758 births Category:1833 deaths Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:British MPs 1774‚Äì1780 Category:British MPs 1780‚Äì1784 Category:British MPs 1784‚Äì1790 Category:British MPs 1790‚Äì1796 Category:British MPs 1796‚Äì1800 Category:Diplomatic peers Category:Dukes of Sutherland Category:Highland Clearances George Leveson- Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Lord- Lieutenants of Staffordshire Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Sutherland Category:Staffordshire Yeomanry officers Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Newcastle-under-Lyme Category:Ambassadors of Great Britain to France Category:United Kingdom Postmasters General Category:Marquesses of Stafford ","title":"George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland"},{"id":"2358073","text":"The SNCF Class BB 27000 \\"Prima\\" electric locomotives were built by Alstom between 2001‚Äì2005.

Such a policy was alleged to have been directed almost exclusively at suspected or actual members of Irish republican paramilitary groups. The Special Air Service (SAS) is the most high-profile of the agencies that were accused of employing this policy, as well as other British Army regiments, and the RUC.Human Rights in Northern Ireland, Human Rights Watch, pp.48‚Äì49 Notable incidents alleging the use of the shoot-to-kill policy include the Loughgall ambush; Operation Flavius in Gibraltar; the Drumnakilly ambush; the Coagh ambush; the Clonoe ambush; and an incident in Strabane in which three IRA volunteers were shot dead. The SAS killed 24 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) members at these locations. Other high-profile incidents involving alleged shoot-to-kill incidents occurred in Belfast, Derry, East and West Tyrone and South Armagh. The killing of Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member Brian Robinson by undercover soldiers is notable for being the most prominent of the very few alleged \\"shoot-to- kill\\" incidents where the victim was a loyalist. Petty criminals were also shot. On 13 January 1990 a British undercover unit shot dead three men whom they believed were members of an IRA unit robbing a shop, but it was later discovered that they were ordinary criminals.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch90.htm#13190 CAIN: Saturday 13 January 1990 Later that year soldiers from the British Parachute Regiment shot three joyriders who passed through their checkpoint travelling at high speed, killing two teenagers; one of the soldiers, Lee Clegg, was tried over the shootings.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch90.htm#30990  Stalker/Sampson Inquiry  On 24 May 1984 an inquiry under Deputy Chief Constable John Stalker of the Greater Manchester Police was opened into three specific cases where it was alleged that a specially trained undercover RUC team known as the \\"Headquarters Mobile Support Unit\\" had carried out a \\"shoot- to-kill\\" policy: *11 November 1982: The killing of three unarmed IRA members at an RUC checkpoint in east Lurgan, County Armagh. Three officers were acquitted of their murder in June 1984, the presiding judge, Lord Justice Maurice Gibson, commending them for their \\"courage and determination in bringing the three deceased men to justice ‚Äì in this case, to the final court of justice.\\" *24 November 1982: The killing, by an RUC undercover unit, of Michael Tighe and the wounding of his friend Martin McCauley at an IRA arms cache on a farm near Lurgan, County Armagh. (19 years later, McCauley was arrested in Colombia, accused by the Colombian authorities of teaching FARC guerillas in the use of explosives, in particular the \\"barrack buster\\"). *12 December 1982: The killing at an RUC checkpoint in Mullacreavie, County Armagh, of two INLA members, Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll. (The intended main target, Dominic McGlinchey, was not in their car as expected.) The shootings were initially investigated by other members of the RUC, and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland decided to bring prosecutions. At the first trial, relating to the shootings of the two INLA men, Constable John Robinson admitted to having been instructed to lie in his statements, and that other witnesses had similarly altered their stories to provide justification for opening fire on Grew and Carroll. When Robinson was found not guilty, the resulting public outcry caused RUC Chief Constable John Hermon to ask John Stalker to investigate the killings. On 5 June 1986, just before Stalker was to make his final report, he was removed from his position in charge of the inquiry. On 30 June, he was suspended from duty over allegations of association with criminals. On 22 August, he was cleared of the allegations and returned to duty, although he was not reinstated as head of the inquiry. The inquiry was taken over by Colin Sampson of the West Yorkshire Police. Its findings were never made public. In the book Stalker, published by Stalker in 1988, the following descriptions of his investigation into the three shooting incidents appeared, concerning the McKerr, Toman and Burns shooting: Concerning the three incidents as a whole, Stalker wrote: According to The Times of 9 February 1988, Stalker stated that although he never found written evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy, there was a \\"clear understanding\\" that officers were expected to enforce it. In 1990 the RUC issued a response to Stalker's book, saying that the book contained many inaccuracies and distortions and gave a misleading impression. In particular it stated, in contradiction to Stalker's assertions, that: * it was wrong to allege that the three investigations were carried out under different detectives as the same detective superintendent was in charge of two of the investigations * the investigation files were presented to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the format approved by him * it was already established in a police statement of 13 November 1982 that no police officer had been struck by the car driven by Gervaise McKerr * it had been advisable, for the safety of the three officers, that they leave the scene immediately * their weapons had been seized without delay by the scene of crimes officers * no incorrect information was given to the investigating officers concerning where the shooting occurred, although uniformed officers had mistakenly positioned the tape on the junction and it was repositioned accurately shortly afterwards * although it was accepted that all the cartridges were not recovered, due to the torrential rain at the time some could have been washed down the drains; the area had nonetheless been swept over for two days with metal detectors. Criticisms were also made that Stalker had gone outside his remit to reinvestigate the shooting incidents as well as a terrorist incident on 27 October 1982 in which three police officers had been killed and that his report, when submitted, lacked the clarity and precision normally associated with criminal investigations. The government also submitted that, on 23 June 1992, Thorburn, when he withdrew a libel action against the RUC Chief Constable, made a statement in which he took the opportunity to submit publicly that he was satisfied that the RUC had not pursued a shoot-to-kill policy in 1982 and that the RUC Chief Constable had not condoned or authorised any deliberate or reckless killings by his officers. Other members of the Stalker/Sampson inquiry team also stated in June 1990 that \\"the Greater Manchester officers wish to stress that the Stalker/Sampson Enquiry found no evidence of a 'Shoot to Kill policy'\\".European Court of Human Rights ‚Äì McKERR v. THE UNITED KINGDOM ‚Äì 28883/95 [2001] ECHR 329 (4 May 2001) THIRD SECTION  Court rulings  Some of the victims' families were awarded reimbursement of legal expenses from the Ministry of Defence following cases brought to the European Court of Human Rights against the British government. The European judges considered four cases between 1982 and 1992 in which 14 people were killed. They involved the deaths of 12 IRA members and two civilians (one a Sinn F√©in member) by the SAS, the RUC and the loyalist Ulster Defence Association, allegedly acting in collusion with the RUC. In the judgement, the court ruled that eight armed IRA men shot dead by soldiers of an SAS unit at Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987, and two IRA men killed by RUC officers, had their human rights violated. It said this had arisen because of the failure of the state authorities to conduct a proper investigation into the circumstances of the deaths, though the court did not rule that the use of lethal force itself was unlawful. A similar finding was brought in the case of Sinn F√©in member Patrick Shanaghan, who was killed by loyalist paramilitaries. The findings were brought under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Cultural impact  A number of television programmes were produced about or in reaction to specific incidents in particular or the shoot-to-kill issue in general: * Death on the Rock ‚Äì an edition of This Week about the Gibraltar killings, produced by Thames Television for ITV, shown on 28 April 1988. * Nineteen 96 ‚Äì a BBC1 Screen One drama, broadcast on BBC1 on 17 September 1989 which, in relocating the Stalker inquiry to Wales in 1996 and combining it with some elements of the Kincora boys' home scandal, treated it as fiction set in the future. Keith Barron was cast as the investigating officer. The drama was written by G. F. Newman and directed by Karl Francis * Shoot to Kill ‚Äì a four-hour drama documentary about the Stalker inquiry, with Jack Shepherd in the lead role, David Calder as John Thorburn, and T. P. McKenna as Sir John Hermon. It had originally been intended to be a straightforward documentary, but in the words of the director, \\"all of the people we would have wanted to interview were either dead ‚Äì in that they were shot by the RUC in 1982 ‚Äì they had disappeared and were given new identities, or they were still serving policemen and weren't available for interview.\\"Shoot to Kill ‚Äì The Issues (Yorkshire Television for ITV, 4 June 1990) The drama featured re-enactments of all three incidents investigated by Stalker ‚Äì including information that Dominic McGlinchey had been the intended target in the third ‚Äì and the course of Stalker's investigation. Written by Michael Eaton and directed by Peter Kosminsky, and produced by Yorkshire Television for ITV, it was shown in two parts on 3 and 4 June 1990, with the second episode being followed by a half-hour studio discussion between Kosminsky, Conservative Member of Parliament Ian Gow (assassinated by the Provisional IRA two months later), Social Democratic and Labour Party MP Seamus Mallon, Ulster Unionist Party MP David Trimble, and Larry Cox of Amnesty International. * Hidden Agenda ‚Äì a 1990 film directed by Ken Loach which based a fictionalised version of the Stalker inquiry in the context of the shooting of an American civil rights lawyer. * Lethal Force ‚Äì an edition of Panorama investigating a number of cases, including the killing by undercover members of 14 Intelligence Company of John McNeill, Eddie Hale and Peter Thompson, as they attempted to rob a Belfast betting shop armed with replica firearms on 13 January 1990, and the killing by soldiers of 3 Para of joyriders Martin Peake and Karen Reilly on 30 September the same year. It was shown on BBC1 on 22 July 1991. * You, Me and Marley ‚Äì a BBC2 Screenplay drama, written by Graham Reid and directed by Richard Spence, inspired by the killing of Peake and Reilly, and shown on 30 September 1992 (the first anniversary of their deaths).

In 2013, its population was 153,143. Foggia is the main city of a plain called Tavoliere, also known as the \\"granary of Italy\\". History Piazza Cavour in Foggia The name \\"Foggia\\" might derive from Latin \\"fovea\\", meaning \\"pit\\", referring to the pits where wheat was stored. The name's etymology remains uncertain however, as it could as well stem from \\"Phocaea\\", or most probably from the Medieval Greek word for \\"fire\\", which is \\"fotia\\", as according to legend the original -11th-c-AD- settlers were peasants, allegedly after having [miraculously] discovered there a panel portraying the Madonna, on which three flames burnt. The area had been settled since Neolithic times, and later on a Greek colony known as Argos Hippium existed nearby (in Greek, ·ºàœÅŒ≥œåœÅŒπœÄœÄŒ± or ·ºàœÅŒ≥œçœÅŒπœÄœÄŒøŒπ). However the first document attesting the existence of the modern city dates from circa 1000 AD, during the catepanate era of Byzantine sovereignty. The area remained marshy and unhealthy, until Robert Guiscard directed draining the wetland, boosting the economic and social growth of the city. The city was the seat of Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo during the last twenty years of the 11th century. In the 12th century, William II of Sicily built a cathedral here and further enlarged the settlement. Frederick II had a palace built in Foggia in 1223, in which he often sojourned. It was also seat of his court and a studium, including notable figures such as the mathematician and scholar Michael Scot, but little of it remains now. In 1447, King Alfonso V of Aragon built a Custom Palace to tax the local sheep farmers. This caused a decline of the local economy and the progressive ruin of the land, which again became marshy. In 1456, an earthquake struck Foggia, followed by others in 1534, 1627 and 1731, the last destroying one third of the city. The House of Bourbon promoted a certain economic growth by boosting the cereal agriculture of Capitanata and rebuilding much of the settlement. In the 19th century, Foggia received a railway station and important public monuments. The citizens also took part in the riots which led to the annexation to Italy in 1861. By 1865, there was a definitive shift from the custom of sheep farming in favour of an agricultural economy. The historical lack of water resources was solved with the construction of the Apulian aqueduct in 1924, when Foggia was already an important hub between northern and southern Italy. During World War II, Foggia was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces for its important airfields and marshalling yards. After the armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, the town was briefly occupied by German troops in Operation Achse. There was some fighting there during the Allied invasion of Italy. In response to the Allied advance towards them, the German troops occupying Foggia abandoned the city on the 27th of September. By the 1st of October British troops had successfully occupied the city. In order to clear the Germans from the hills north and west of the Fogia plain and to reach the Vinchiaturo-Termoli road near the Biferno River, Britain's General Montgomery sent his British 13th Corps beyond Foggia on a two division drive, the 78th Division (sometimes known as \\"the Battle Axe division\\") moved on the coastal road to Termoli and the 1st Canadian Division struck inland through the mountains. 5th Corps followed, protecting the west flank and the rear. The German 1st parachute division had largely withdrawn to the Biferno River near Termoli and dug in. Based out of Foggia, the British launched Operation Devon and succeeded in dislodging the Nazi German forces from Termoli. In 1959 and 2006, Foggia received, respectively, the Gold Medal for Civil and Military value for its role in World War II. Geography =Climate= Foggia has a dry summer, Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). Winter days are generally between 11-13 ¬∞C but can be as cool as single figures. Low temperatures are generally above freezing, but frosts are experienced a handful of times a year. Summers are very hot, with temperatures in July and August often reaching . Temperatures exceed a handful of times a decade. Extremes are on 8 January 1985 and - the highest temperature recorded in Italy and one of the highest recorded in Europe - on 25 June 2007. Government Main sights Foggia, Cathedral from via Arpi * The cathedral of Santa Maria de Fovea, which is directly linked with the patron saint \\"Madonna dei Sette Veli\\" (Madonna of the Seven Veils). This site has two levels of architectural style: the lower part is Romanesque, as with many Apulian churches; the upper part is a remarkable example of Baroque. The upper part was reconstructed after an earthquake that destroyed a great part of the historical centre. * Palazzo Dogana, the historical seat of the sheep custom. On July 2013 this Palace was elected by UNESCO as \\"Messenger Monument of the Culture of Peace\\" for its role in the cultural exchanges during centuries. * Chiesa delle Croci (\\"Church of the Crosses\\"). * I Tre Archi (\\"The Three Arches\\"). * Arco di Federico II (\\"Arch of Frederick II\\"). * Archaeological park of Passo di Corvo. Economy It is a communication and industrial center and the main wheat market of Southern Italy. Foggia is famous for its watermelons and tomatoes.Italy World Club: Foggia, Puglia (Apulia), Italy Although less important than once before, the agricultural sector remains the mainstay of Foggia's economy. This area is nicknamed the \\"granary of Italy\\". The few industries present are mostly devoted to food processing. Craftsmanship is also encouraged and developed. Transport Foggia railway station, opened in 1864, forms part of the Adriatic Railway (Ancona‚ÄìLecce), and is the terminus of the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway. It is also a junction for several other, secondary lines, namely the Foggia‚ÄìManfredonia, Lucera‚ÄìFoggia and Foggia‚ÄìPotenza railways, making Foggia the most important railway junction of southern Italy and the third one of whole Italy. Foggia is served by Gino Lisa Airport, which offers direct flights operated with helicopters to Tremiti Islands and Vieste. Sport Foggia's stadium is named after Pino Zaccheria, a local pioneer of basketball killed during World War II. It is home of the town's football team Foggia, which was very popular in early 1990s because of its sparkling interpretation of total football led by coach Zdenek Zeman. U.S. Foggia currently plays in Serie C (the third highest football division in Italy). In February 2019 Foggia will host the European Cadet and Junior Fencing Championships.

Full Impact was known for excellent graphing and visual display, far better than contemporary versions of Microsoft Excel. But this was also its only really compelling feature, and it was unable to find a market niche given the dominance of Excel in the Macintosh marketplace. History Full Impact started in a roundabout fashion when early Apple employee and programmer Randy Wigginton decided to write a spreadsheet program. Wigginton had left Apple during the Macintosh development process to start Encore Systems with two friends, Don Breuner and Ed Ruder. They were soon hired by Steve Jobs to develop a word processor for the soon- to-be-released Macintosh, which would become MacWrite. Wigginton wanted to duplicate this success by making a GUI-based spreadsheet that would be easier to use than anything on the market. Unlike a word processor, however, a spreadsheet requires a complex \\"engine\\" to quickly solve the many equations that make it up. Starting in September 1984, shortly after the Mac's release, Wigginton and his two partners started looking for an engine, and were introduced to Richard Ross by an Apple employee. They agreed that Encore would adapt a GUI to Ross's engine, which would become MacCalc. It was not long before these plans started to fall apart. Ross wanted to retain control the product and sell it through his company, Bravo Technologies, while Wigginton and his partners felt it would be much wiser to license it to a larger company, and that Ross was pushing them out of the decision making. Eventually they decided to look for another partner, and shortly thereafter Wigginton met with several employees of Ashton-Tate and presented a demo of their existing prototype program. Ashton-Tate was interested, and agreed to fund development of the product in exchange for marketing rights.Ashton-Tate Corporation v. Ross, Argued and Submitted July 17, 1990. Decided Oct. 4, 1990. OpenJurist They used the prototype GUI created for MacCalc along with a new engine, Alembic, (written by Queue Associates) and almost completely rewritten by Les Vogel to create the Glass project, also known as Pegasus. This head start should have allowed the product to ship fairly quickly. Instead, Ashton-Tate vacillated between being extremely interested in the Macintosh market, considering it a way to break out of their dBASE-dominated PC line, and then being completely ambivalent about it. This vacillation appears to have been based largely on Mac sales reports; when sales were up the Mac was Ashton- Tate's next big thing, when sales dropped it wasn't worth bothering with. When interested, Encore's development funds would arrive on time - when they weren't, the money would disappear for months. The Encore team was repeatedly forced to take on other projects in order to pay the bills, stretching what should have been a short project into a several-year ordeal. Then, just when the product was finally ready to ship, Ross decided to sue Ashton-Tate, claiming he had rights to the program. Ross lost the case and today it is considered one of the classic examples of intellectual property rights law. Ross went on to release his version as MacCalc, and gained very positive reviews.Doug Green, \\"Spreadsheet Program Amazingly Speedy\\", InfoWorld, 3 November 1986, pg. 45-47 With the lawsuit out of the way, the product finally started shipping in August 1988, with the new name Full Impact. A minor upgrade, 1.1, followed in December. Reviews were generally positive, noting in particular how the system allowed you to have up to eight \\"subsheets\\" within any document. This feature is common today, but at the time it was considered novel and extremely useful. Full Impact was also one of the first spreadsheets to allow typing data and formulas directly into the cells, a feature that is still fairly poorly implemented today. Reviewers were also pleased with the powerful macro language, which included functionality such WHILE loops. But certainly the most lauded feature was that Full Impact allowed you to include other objects, such as text blocks, charts or pictures, directly on top of the sheets. At the time, most spreadsheets displayed these items in separate views. After the delays, the timing turned out to be particularly bad. Microsoft had recently shipped Excel 3.0, which was off to a strong start. Only shortly after Full Impact was released, Informix Wingz shipped, and was heavily marketed‚Äîincluding sending their frontman, Leonard Nimoy, around to various Macintosh-related trade shows. Ashton-Tate positioned the product as a \\"presentation spreadsheet\\" to focus on its graphics capabilities, but it seems the term meant as much to potential customers then as it does today. Sales of Full Impact were predictably soft as a result, as were Ashton-Tate's other Mac products, FullWrite Professional and dBASE Mac, which suffered from various problems. Ashton-Tate didn't take this as a signal to fix them, and instead ignored all of the products for the next year or so. Finally, in late 1989, a round of upgrades to FullWrite and Full Impact were announced. Full Impact 2.0s was released in 1990, including 3-D charts and the ability to include voice notes, a major feature of a coincident release of FullWrite 1.5s as well. A separate release in 1989 added Clear Access at $99, a 3rd party database linking technology based on Apple's CL/1. But this was also the point at which Ashton-Tate's cash cow, dBASE, failed. In 1990, they released dBASE IV, which was so buggy that customers generally refused to use it. Many took this as an opportunity to try out similar products, and discovered that FoxPro and Clipper had been better than dBASE for some time already. The company was soon bleeding money and gave up on the Mac market, ending development of their entire suite. By 1991, the company was becoming insolvent and was purchased by Borland for cents on the dollar.

Early life Sutherland-Leveson- Gower was born at Portland Place, London on 8 August 1786. and baptised at St Marylebone Parish Church. He was the eldest son of George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland and his wife Elizabeth Gordon, suo jure Countess of Sutherland. He was educated at Harrow School from 1798 to 1803, then entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1806 and M.A. in 1810. In 1841 he graduated D.C.L. at the same university. Between 1806 and 1808, Earl Gower travelled in Prussia and Russia. During the Prussian campaign against Napoleon's French forces, he spent time at the Prussians' general headquarters. Career After returning from Europe, Earl Gower entered the Commons as M.P. for the Cornwall rotten borough of St Mawes in 1808. In 1812, he transferred to sit for the Staffordshire borough of Newcastle-Under-Lyme, until 1815, when he stood to become one of the county MPs for Staffordshire, sitting until 1820. He was also Lord Lieutenant for the County of Sutherland from 1831 until his death, was appointed High Steward of the Borough of Stafford in 1833, and was Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire from 1839 to 1845. He was appointed Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) in 1841. =Cricket= Sutherland was an active first-class cricketer in 1816 when he played for Marylebone Cricket Club and a team organised by E. H. Budd in a total of three matches. =Peerage= His father died in 1833, only six months after being created Duke of Sutherland by William IV for his support for the Reform Act 1832, and so this new title devolved on his eldest son. His mother, who was 19th Countess of Sutherland in her own right, died in 1839, and so her ancient Scottish title passed to George, who also became 20th Earl of Sutherland. As a result, the two titles were united in the same person until 1963. It was the 2nd Duke who assumed the additional surname of Sutherland, so that his family name became Sutherland-Leveson-Gower. Personal life On 28 May 1823, Sutherland was married to Lady Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana Howard (1806‚Äì1868). Lady Harriet was a daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle. Together, they were the parents of eleven children, seven daughters and four sons: * Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1824‚Äì1878), who married George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and had issue. * Lady Evelyn Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1825‚Äì1869), who married Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre. * Lady Caroline Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1827‚Äì1887), who married Charles FitzGerald, 4th Duke of Leinster and had issue. * George Sutherland- Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland (1828‚Äì1892), who married Anne Hay- Mackenzie. * Lady Blanche Julia Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1830‚Äì1832), who died infancy. * Lord Frederick George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1832‚Äì1854), who died unmarried. * Lady Constance Gertrude Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1834‚Äì1880), who married Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster and had issue. * Lady Victoria Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1838‚Äì1839), who died in infancy. * Lord Albert Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1843‚Äì1874), who married Grace Abdy, daughter of Sir Thomas Neville Abdy, 1st Baronet and had issue, including Frederick Leveson-Gower. * Lord Ronald Charles Sutherland-Leveson- Gower (1845‚Äì1916), who died unmarried. * Lady Alexandrina Sutherland-Leveson- Gower (1848‚Äì1849), who died in infancy. He was a keen book collector and was one of the founder members of the Roxburghe Club in 1812. He was a trustee of the National Gallery from 1835 and of the British Museum from 1841 to his death, as well as appointed a Fine Arts Commissioner in 1841. The Duke died, aged 75, at Trentham Hall in Staffordshire, one of his English mansions, after a period of illness. =Building projects= Sutherland was partially deaf and therefore decided not to play a very active part in politics which was the path well worn by his contemporary peers. Instead he expended his energies by spending some of his vast wealth which he inherited from his father on improving his homes. In 1845, he employed Sir Charles Barry to make vast alterations to Dunrobin Castle. Barry transformed the place into the 189-room ducal palace which we see today. In addition to Dunrobin, the Duke also had Barry completely remodel his Staffordshire seat of Trentham Hall, Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, and the family's London townhouse, Stafford House, which was the most valuable private home in the whole of London. =Descendants= A very large proportion of today's aristocracy are descended from the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. Through the marriages of his daughters, he is the ancestor of the present Dukes of Hamilton & Brandon, Argyll, Roxburghe, Northumberland, Leinster, and Westminster, the present Marquesses of Hertford and Londonderry, the present earls of Selkirk, Lichfield and Cromartie, and the present Viscount Dilhorne, among many others. His male line died out on the death of his great-grandson, the 5th Duke in 1963, and the title passed to John Egerton, a descendant of the 2nd Duke's brother Francis who was not descended from the 2nd Duke (although his wife, Diana, was). The present Countess of Sutherland is a direct descendant of the 2nd Duke. He was also the ancestor of the late Duchess of Beaufort, but not of the present Duke of Beaufort. Other notable descendants include the naturalist Gavin Maxwell and the spymaster Eliza Manningham-Buller.

Taxonomy and systematics Like other yuhinas, it is closely related to the white-eyes and if these were considered a distinct family Zosteropidae, it would be placed there. Otherwise, it would belong together with the white-eyes into the Old World babbler family Timaliidae. The closest living relative of this species appears to be the black-chinned yuhina, which occurs on the Asian mainland. Taiwan yuhina Description The Taiwan yuhina is in length with a chocolate brown crest and a black beard stripe descending from its beak. The bird's back, wings and tail are dark ash brown, and its lower breast is lighter in colour. Agreeing with other typical yuhinas in habitus, its colouration pattern is rather uncommon among the genus. Habitat and ecology This species is found in hill forests at elevations of above sea level, although it is the most common between ; it can descent to low altitudes in winter. It is gregarious, active and quite tame. It keeps to lower forest and often joins other species, especially tits in mixed flocks. The flocks, while feeding, make a constant soft chatter. The call of the Taiwan yuhina is a sound somewhat like twi-MI- chiu, which resembles the phrase \\"We MEET you\\". The yuhina's diet consists of mainly nectar, berries, flowers and small insects. Taiwan yuhina may sometimes be observed hanging upside down on cherry trees. These songbirds are particularly fond of the flowers of the Chinese tulip tree and the fruits of trees of the family Elaeagnaceae and the genus Idesia (Salicaceae). Based on a population in Nantou County, diet during the breeding season mostly consists of nectar and fruits of Taiwan cherry (Prunus campanulata), fruits of eastern debregeasia (Debregeasia orientalis), and nectar of mistletoe Taxillus lonicerifolius. Breeding season for the Taiwan yuhina is from May to June. References *Collar, N. J. & Robson, C. 2007. Family Timaliidae (Babblers) pp. 70 ‚Äì 291 in; del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A. & Christie, D.A. eds.

Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan (probably died c. 1314) was a significant figure in the Wars of Scottish Independence. She was the daughter of Donnchadh III, Earl of Fife, and Johanna de Clare, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford. She was married to John Comyn, Earl of Buchan and thus was the Countess of Buchan. After Robert the Bruce killed John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries, the Earl of Buchan joined the English side in the Scottish Wars of Independence. Isabella took the contrary view. According to tradition, the ceremony of crowning the monarch was performed by a representative of Clan MacDuff, but Isabella arrived in Scone the day after the coronation of Robert the Bruce in March 1306. However, the Bruce agreed to be crowned for a second time the day after, as otherwise some would see the ceremony as irregular, not being performed by a MacDuff. Bruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven in June 1306, so he sent Isabella and his female relatives north, but they were betrayed to the English by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross. Edward I of England ordered her sent to Berwick-upon-Tweed with these instructions: \\"Let her be closely confined in an abode of stone and iron made in the shape of a cross, and let her be hung up out of doors in the open air at Berwick, that both in life and after her death, she may be a spectacle and eternal reproach to travellers.\\"\\"Isobel of Fife, Countess of Buchan\\", Foghlam Alba She was imprisoned in this cage for four years,Education Scotland, \\"Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie Bruce\\" , Education Scotland (a Scottish government agency, \\"the national body in Scotland for supporting quality and improvement in learning and teaching\\").

The last clear mention of her is being transferred again in 1313, her eventual fate is uncertain. Most of Bruce's female relatives returned to Scotland in early 1315, when they were exchanged for English noblemen captured after the Battle of Bannockburn, but there is no mention of her in the records, so she had probably died by then.Bingham, Caroline Robert the BrucePenman, Michael Robert the Bruce: King of the Scots Mary Bruce was treated in a similar fashion at Roxburgh Castle.

It had a political focus and discussed events in East Berlin. Today it is a commercial radio station broadcast with the name \\"Berliner Rundfunk 91.4\\".  History  The Berliner Rundfunk was established in 1945 by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. It initially broadcast from the Haus des Rundfunks building of the former Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (Reich-Radio Association) GmbH on Masurenallee in Berlin-Charlottenburg. It is notable that this broadcaster was located in the British sector of what was to become West Berlin. The station was merged with the regional broadcasters in Potsdam and Schwerin as well as the broadcast studio in Rostock. Funkhaus Nalepastra√üe, 2006 condition In the course of the centralization of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1952, in which among other things five L√§nder were eliminated, the status of East German radio changed. In the meantime, the new radio headquarters of the Rundfunk der DDR was established on Nalepastra√üe in Obersch√∂neweide, East Berlin. After 1952, all radio programs in the GDR emanated from there. The Berliner Rundfunk was changed to the program Berlin I with a political focus and allotted the transmitters in Schwerin and Weimar. The program also took over the shortwave transmission of the previous Deutschlandsender. In August 1953 the radio system was reorganized. This reform created the Deutschlandsender, the Berliner Rundfunk, and the Radio DDR. From June 1954 until September 1955 the program of the Berliner Rundfunk was temporarily called \\"Berlin 1. Programm\\" in contrast to the program of Radio DDR which was called \\"Berlin 2. Programm.\\" The Berliner Rundfunk transmitted its program set over mediumwave (657, 693, 999, 1170, 1431 and 1575 kHz) and VHF. In connection with the unification of the two German states, the Berliner Rundfunk ceased its transmission in February 1990. In Berlin an identically named private radio program broadcast on the VHF frequency 91.4 MHz. The other open frequencies of the Berliner Rundfunk were taken over by regional programs of the newly created L√§nder.

The first man prepositions the waitress, offering her money to have sex with him; it is then revealed that the man had never intended to have sex with the waitress and understood that she would refuse. The second man is revealed to be facing an impending divorce from his wife, and is depicted buying expensive champagne for himself and the train station attendants. The final man is shown speaking to an older man sitting at the cafe and discussing the National Geographic Society. The older man is revealed to be a member of the society, while the other man's father had been prior to his death; it is then revealed that the man's father had recently committed suicide. = \\"A Day's Wait\\" = = \\"A Natural History of the Dead\\" = = \\"Wine of Wyoming\\" = \\"Wine of Wyoming\\" takes place in Wyoming during the Prohibition Era. The story follows the narrator, who is visiting Wyoming for the summer, who befriends a French immigrant couple who sell bootlegged beer and wine out of their home. The story discuses the couple's attempts to make a living in America with their young son, with a backdrop of American patrons who drink to excess and troubles with the law from getting caught selling alcohol. The story makes use of a mixture of French and English dialogue, often switching back and forth within the same conversation. = \\"The Gambler, the Nun, and the Radio\\" = = \\"Fathers and Sons\\" =  1977 Reissue  Reissued in 1977, the collection included three additional stories: *\\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" *\\"The Capital of the World\\" *\\"Old Man at the Bridge\\"  References  = Further reading =  * External links * Category:1933 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Ernest Hemingway Category:Charles Scribner's Sons books ","title":"Winner Take Nothing"},{"id":"2358254","text":"Regional profile This suburban area had leaned Progressive Conservative from 1979 until 1993 when it swung hard to the Liberals primarily due to the rapid growth of the Greater Toronto Area and high immigrant populations, just like the suburbs to the north of Toronto. After winning just one seat (Mississauga East) in 1988, the Liberals swept every seat in this region from 1993 to 2006. The new Conservative Party (replacing the Progressive Conservatives) won their first seats in the area in 2008, picking up Oakville and Mississauga‚ÄîErindale before sweeping the region when they formed a majority government in 2011. However, the Liberals swept the region in 2015, and again in 2019. In 2004, the Liberals won a majority of the vote in every Mississauga and Oakville based seat, while won just under 50% in each of the three Brampton based seats. Their strongest riding was Mississauga East‚ÄîCooksville (57%), while their weakest seat was Brampton West (45%). In 2006, the Liberals won a majority of the votes in just three seats, with their strongest seat this time being Mississauga‚ÄîBrampton South (54%) with their weakest seat being Oakville (43%), which they won by fewer than 800 votes. In 2008, the strongest Liberal seat was again Mississauga East‚ÄîCooksville, the only seat in the region where they won a majority of the vote (50%). In 2011 they were shut out of the region, but nearly won Mississauga East‚ÄîCooksville, losing it by fewer than 700 votes. The Conservatives came within 5 points of winning Brampton West, their best seat in 2004, thanks to star candidate Tony Clement. In 2006, their strongest seat was Oakville, which they nearly won. Oakville remained the Conservatives' best seat in 2008 and 2011. When they swept the region in 2011, Oakville was the only riding where they won a majority of the vote (54%). Thanks to a three-way vote split, the Conservatives still won Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton with just 34% of the vote. The NDP has traditionally been very weak in the region. Thanks to a strong candidacy of Jagmeet Singh, the NDP placed second in Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton in 2011, with 33.5% of the vote, losing the riding by fewer than 600 votes. 2015 - 42nd General Election 2011 - 41st General Election 2008 - 40th General Election 2006 - 39th General Election 2004 - 38th General Election Key map # Bramalea-Gore-Malton # Brampton-Springdale # Brampton West # Mississauga-Brampton South # Mississauga East-Cooksville # Mississauga- Erindale # Mississauga South # Mississauga-Streetsville # Oakville Image:bmcpc.PNGConservative Party of Canada Image:bmgpc.PNGGreen Party of Canada Image:bmlpc.PNGLiberal Party of Canada Image:bmndp.PNGNew Democratic Party References Notes Category:Canadian federal election results in Ontario Category:Politics of Brampton Category:Politics of Mississauga Category:Politics of Oakville, Ontario ","title":"Canadian federal election results in Brampton, Mississauga and Oakville"},{"id":"2358257","text":"Belgrano Department may refer to: *Belgrano Department, San Luis *Belgrano Department, Santa Fe *Belgrano Department, Santiago del Estero Category:Department name disambiguation pages pt:Belgrano (departamento) ","title":"Belgrano Department"},{"id":"2358261","text":"State Road 93 (SR 93) is the unsigned Florida Department of Transportation designation for most of Interstate 75 (I-75) in Florida.

History The company was founded in 1703, when Izaak Ensched√© registered with the Printers Guild in Haarlem. Joh. Ensched√© has long been associated with the printing of banknotes; the company printed the \\"Robin\\" (Dutch Roodborstje), the very first Dutch banknote, in 1814.\\"Stempel in de Stad ‚Äì 310 jaar Koninklijke Joh.

Ensched√© has printed the banknotes of the State of the Netherlands. In 1866, after the death of Johannes Ensched√© III, Joh. Ensched√© sold the family's book collection and began printing stamps. Typefounding Ensched√© began manufacturing type in 1743 after purchasing the foundry of Hendrik Wetstein, and the foundry soon became the most important part of Ensched√©‚Äôs business. The famous punch-cutter Joan Michael Fleischman was employed there in the eighteenth century. Its type business flourished throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in the twentieth century the foundry achieved widespread international acclaim through the design and production of types of Jan van Krimpen. During the foundry type era, Ensched√© types were distributed in the United States by Continental Type Founders Association. =Foundry typefaces= These foundry types were produced by Ensched√©:Jaspert, W. Pincus, W. Turner Berry and A.F. Johnson. The Encyclopedia of Type Faces.

In 1893 for their 150th anniversary, a memorial book was commissioned called Ensched√© gedenkschrift 1743-1893. The book was such a success that ten years later they decided to open a museum with artefacts from their archives, and in 1904 Museum Ensched√© was founded in the old type foundry. In 1978, to celebrate their 275th anniversary, Ensched√© commissioned Bram de Does, one of Holland‚Äôs leading typographers, to design a digital typeface specifically for phototypesetting. The result was Trinit√©, a face which clearly shows its provenance and which continues the tradition of type design established at Ensched√© so many years before.

Protests emerged when the Flemish adviser Jean de Sauvage was named its president, presaging later troubles. The Revolt of the Comuneros (, \\"War of the Communities of Castile\\") was an uprising by citizens of Castile against the rule of Charles I and his administration between 1520 and 1521. At its height, the rebels controlled the heart of Castile, ruling the cities of Valladolid, Tordesillas, and Toledo. The revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the Crown of Castile after the death of Queen Isabella I in 1504. Isabella's daughter Joanna succeeded to the throne. Due to Joanna's mental instability, Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, as a regent. After Ferdinand's death in 1516, Joanna's sixteen-year-old son Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in the Netherlands with little knowledge of Castilian. He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics. These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites, who could see the threat to their power and status. In 1519, Charles was elected Holy Roman Emperor. He departed for Germany in 1520, leaving the Dutch cardinal Adrian of Utrecht to rule Castile in his absence. Soon, a series of anti-government riots broke out in the cities, and local city councils (Comunidades) took power. The rebels chose Charles' own mother, Queen Joanna, as an alternative ruler, hoping they could control her madness. The rebel movement took on a radical anti-feudal dimension, supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility. On April 23, 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar. The following day, rebel leaders Juan L√≥pez de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado were beheaded. The army of the comuneros fell apart. Only the city of Toledo kept alive the rebellion led by Mar√≠a Pacheco, until its surrender in October 1521. The character of the revolution is a matter of historiographical debate. According to some scholars, the revolt was one of the first modern revolutions, notably because of the anti-noble sentiment against social injustice and its basis on ideals of democracy and freedom. Others consider it a more typical rebellion against high taxes and perceived foreign control. From the 19th century onwards, the revolt has been mythologized by various Spaniards, generally liberals who drew political inspiration from it. Conservative intellectuals have traditionally adopted more pro-Imperial stances toward the revolt, and have been critical of both the motives and the government of the comuneros. With the end of Franco's dictatorship and the establishment of the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n, positive commemoration of the Comunidades has grown. April 23 is now celebrated as Castile and Le√≥n Day, and the incident is often referred to in Castilian nationalism. Origins King Charles I of Castile and Aragon, later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, by Bernard van Orley. Charles would rule one of the largest empires in European history‚Äîthrough his father Philip, Burgundy and the Netherlands; through his mother Joanna, Castile, Aragon, and Naples; and through his grandfather Maximilian and his election in 1519 as Holy Roman Emperor, Germany, Austria, and much of Northern Italy. Discontent had been brewing for years before the Revolt of the Comuneros. The second half of the 15th century saw profound political, economic, and social changes in Spain. Economic growth created new urban industries and offered a route to power and wealth not tied to the aristocracy. Support from these urban elites was critical to Ferdinand and Isabella's centralization of power, and they acted as a counterweight to the landed aristocracy and the clergy.Haliczer 1981, p. 10. However, with Isabella I's death and Joanna's accession in 1504, this alliance between the national government and the budding middle class faltered. The Castilian government decayed with each successive administration, becoming rife with corruption.Haliczer 1981, p. 113. Joanna's husband, Philip I, reigned briefly; he was replaced by Archbishop Cisneros as regent for a short time, and then by Isabella's widower Ferdinand who ruled from Aragon.Haliczer 1981, p. 151. Ferdinand's claim to continue ruling Castile as regent was somewhat tenuous after Isabella's death, but no plausible alternatives existed as the sovereign, their widowed daughter Joanna, was mentally unfit to reign on her own. The landed nobility of Castile took advantage of the weak and corrupt Royal Council to illegally expand their territory and domain with private armies while the government did nothing.Haliczer 1981, p. 66. In response, the towns signed mutual defense pacts, relying on each other rather than the national government.Haliczer 1981, p. 93. The budgets of both Castile and Aragon had been in poor condition for some time. The government had expelled the Jews in 1492 and the Muslims of Granada in 1502, moves that undercut lucrative trades and businesses.Haliczer 1981, p. 147. The silk industry is held up as particularly relevant, as the Moors had been deeply involved in it; more generally, many Muslim converts to Christianity who had not been expelled still emigrated from 1500 onward. Ferdinand and Isabella had been forced to borrow money to pay troops during and after the Reconquista, and Spanish military obligations had only increased since then.Haliczer 1981, p. 147. A large number of troops were required to maintain stability in recently conquered Granada, threatened by revolt from the maltreated moriscos (former Muslims who had converted to Christianity) and frequent naval raids from Muslim nations along the Mediterranean.Haliczer 1981, p. 163. Additionally, Ferdinand had invaded and occupied the Iberian part of Navarre in 1512, and forces were required to garrison it against Navarrese revolts and French armies.Haliczer 1981, p. 145. Very little money was left to pay for the royal army in Castile proper, let alone service foreign debts. The corruption in the government since Isabella's death only made the budget shortfalls worse. =Succession of Charles= In 1516, Ferdinand died. The remaining heir was Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson Charles, who became King Charles I of both Castile and Aragon in coregency with his mother Joanna. Charles was brought up in Flanders, the homeland of his father Philip, and barely knew Castilian.Lynch 1964, p. 36. The people greeted him with skepticism, but also hoped he would restore stability. With the arrival of the new king in late 1517, his Flemish court took positions of power in Castile; young Charles only trusted people he knew from the Netherlands. Among the most scandalous of these was the appointment of the twenty-year-old William de Cro√ø as Archbishop of Toledo. The Archbishopric was an important position; it had been held by Archbishop Cisneros, the former regent of the country.Haliczer 1981, p. 126. Six months into his rule, discontent openly simmered among rich and poor alike. Even some monks began to agitate, denouncing the opulence of the royal court, the Flemish, and the nobility in their sermons. One of the first public protests involved placards posted in churches, which read: With the unrest growing, Charles' paternal grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I died in 1519. A new election had to be held to choose the next emperor. Charles campaigned aggressively for the post, vying with King Francis I of France to bribe the most prince- electors.Seaver 1928, p. 50. Charles I won the election, becoming Emperor Charles V and cementing the power of the House of Habsburg. He prepared to head to Germany to take possession of his new domains in the Holy Roman Empire. =New taxes: The Cortes of Santiago and Corunna= Charles had already stressed the treasury to its limit with his extravagant Flemish court, and over 1 million florins were spent in bribes for the election.Lynch 1964, p. 38. Taxes had to be raised to cover the debt, but any new taxes had to be approved by the Cortes (Castile's own parliamentary body). Thus, in late March 1520, Charles convened the Cortes in Santiago de Compostela. Charles ensured the Cortes would only have limited power, and further attempted to stack the Cortes with pliable representatives he could bribe. Support for the opposition only increased in response, and the representatives demanded that their grievances be heard first before any new tax was granted.Haliczer 1981, p. 159. A group of clerics soon circulated a statement in protest of the king. It argued three points: any new taxes should be rejected; Castile should be embraced and the foreign Empire rejected; and if the king did not take into account his subjects, the Comunidades themselves should defend the interests of the kingdom.P√©rez 2001, p. 39‚Äì40. It was the first time where the word comunidades (communities, communes) was used to signify the independent populace, and the name would stick to the councils later formed. At this point, most of the members of the Cortes in Santiago intended to vote against the king's requested duties and taxes, even with the Cortes stacked with royalists. In response, Charles decided to suspend the Cortes on April 4.Seaver 1928, p. 75. He convened them again in Corunna on April 22, this time getting his program passed. On May 20, he embarked for Germany, and left as regent of his Spanish possessions his former tutor, Adrian of Utrecht (better known as the future Pope Adrian VI).Seaver 1928, p. 77‚Äì79. Beginnings of the Revolt =Rebelliousness in Toledo= Toledo, home of the first Comunidad Juan L√≥pez de Padilla, leader of the Comunidad of Toledo In April 1520, Toledo was already unstable. The city council had been at the forefront of protests against Charles' bid to become Holy Roman Emperor. They decried the short-term expenses that would be borne by Castile and questioned the role of Castile in this new political framework, given the possibility that the land would become a mere imperial province. The situation erupted when the royal government summoned the most radical of the city councilors away from the city, intending to send back more easily controllable replacements on a royal salary. The order came on April 15; one day later, as the councilors prepared to leave, a large crowd opposed to the departure rioted and drove out the royal administrators instead.Haliczer 1981, p. 160. A citizen's committee was elected under the leadership of Juan L√≥pez de Padilla and Pedro Laso de la Vega, naming themselves a Comunidad. On April 21, the remaining administrators were driven from the fortifications of the Alc√°zar of Toledo.Haliczer 1981, p. 161, and Seaver 1928, p. 87. P√©rez 2001 lists the final fall as happening on May 31; this is (almost certainly) referring to the formal capture of the Alc√°zar. The defending forces had long since left by then. Following Charles' departure to Germany, the riots multiplied in the cities of central Castile, especially after the arrival of legislators who had voted \\"yes\\" to the taxes Charles had asked for. Segovia had some of the earliest and most violent incidents; on May 30, a mob of woolworkers murdered two administrators and the city's legislator who had voted in favor.Haliczer 1981, p. 3. Incidents of a similar size occurred in cities such as Burgos and Guadalajara, while others, such as Le√≥n, √Åvila, and Zamora, suffered minor altercations.P√©rez 2001, p. 50‚Äì52. =Proposals to other cities= With widespread discontent circulating, on June 8 Toledo's council suggested to cities with a vote in the Cortes to hold an emergency meeting. They proffered five goals: # Cancel the taxes voted in the Cortes of Corunna. # A return to the local-controlled encabezamiento system of taxation. # Reserve official positions and church benefices for Castilians. # Prohibit money from leaving the kingdom to fund foreign affairs. # Designate a Castilian to lead the kingdom in the absence of the king.P√©rez 2001, p. 53‚Äì54. These claims, especially the first two, spread quickly through society. Ideas began to circulate of replacing the king; Toledo's leaders floated the possibility of turning the cities of Castile into independent free cities, similar to Genoa and other Italian republics. Competing proposals suggested keeping the monarchy, but dethroning Charles. They proposed that he be replaced by either his mother Queen Joanna or his Castilian-born brother Ferdinand. With these ideas, the revolt shifted from a simple protest against taxes to a broader revolution. Many cities, while not quite in outright revolt, stopped sending taxes to the Royal Council and began to self-govern.Haliczer 1981, p. 164. Expansion of the Revolt =Blockade of Segovia= Segovia, the city of the first armed clash between the comuneros and the royalists The situation moved closer to armed conflict on June 10. Rodrigo Ronquillo had been sent to Segovia by the Royal Council to investigate the recent murder of Segovia's legislator, but Segovia refused him entry. Unable to besiege a city of 30,000 with only a small force, Ronquillo instead set out to blockade foodstuffs and other supplies from entering Segovia. The people of Segovia, led by militia leader and noble Juan Bravo, rallied around the Comunidad. Segovia requested aid against Ronquillo's army from the Comunidades of Toledo and Madrid. The cities responded by sending their militias, captained by Juan L√≥pez de Padilla and Juan de Zapata, who won in the first major confrontation between the forces of the king and the rebels. =The Junta of √Åvila= Other cities now followed the lead of Toledo and Segovia, deposing their governments. A revolutionary Cortes, (\\"Holy Assembly of the Communities\\"), held its first session in √Åvila and declared itself the legitimate government deposing the Royal Council. Padilla was named Captain-General, and troops were assembled. Still, only four cities sent representatives at first: Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, and Toro.Haliczer 1981, p. 166. =Burning of Medina del Campo= The Castillo de la Mota of Medina del Campo Faced with the situation in Segovia, Regent and Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht decided to use the royal artillery, located in nearby Medina del Campo, to take Segovia and defeat Padilla. Adrian ordered his commander Antonio de Fonseca to seize the artillery.Haliczer 1981, p. 165. Fonseca arrived on August 21 in Medina, but encountered heavy resistance from the townspeople, as the city had strong trade links to Segovia. Fonseca ordered the setting of a fire to distract the resistance, but it grew out of control. Much of the town was destroyed, including a Franciscan monastery and a trade warehouse containing goods valued at more than 400,000 ducats. Fonseca had to withdraw his troops, and the event was a public relations disaster for the government.Seaver 1928, p. 129. Uprisings throughout Castile occurred, even in cities that previously had been neutral such as Castile's capital, Valladolid. The establishment of the Comunidad of Valladolid caused the most important core of the Iberian plateau to declare for the rebels, upending the stability of the government. New members now joined the Junta of √Åvila and the Royal Council looked discredited; Adrian had to flee to Medina de Rioseco as Valladolid fell.Haliczer 1981, p. 6. The royal army, with many of its soldiers unpaid for months, started to disintegrate. =The Junta of Tordesillas= Joanna the Mad, officially the Queen and co-regent of Castile with her son Charles, actually had no power whatsoever The comunero army now properly organized itself, integrating the militias of Toledo, Madrid, and Segovia. Once told of Fonseca's attack, the comunero forces went to Medina del Campo and took possession of the artillery that had just been denied to Fonseca's troops.P√©rez 2001, p. 60. On August 29, the comuneros' army arrived at Tordesillas with the goal of declaring Queen Joanna the sole sovereign. The Junta moved from √Åvila to Tordesillas at the Queen's request and invited cities that had not yet sent representatives to do so.Seaver 1928, p. 164. A total of thirteen cities were represented in the Junta of Tordesillas: Burgos, Soria, Segovia, √Åvila, Valladolid, Le√≥n, Salamanca, Zamora, Toro, Toledo, Cuenca, Guadalajara, and Madrid.Haliczer 1981, p. 167. The only invited cities that failed to attend were the four Andalusian cities: Seville, Granada, Cordova, and Ja√©n. Since most of the kingdom was represented at Tordesillas, the Junta renamed itself the (\\"General Assembly of the Kingdom\\").P√©rez 2001, p. 61. In the spelling of the time, it was rendered Cortes e Junta General del Reyno. On September 24, 1520, the mad Queen, for the only time, presided over the Cortes.Seaver 1928, p. 147. The legislators met with Queen Joanna and explained the purpose of the Cortes: to proclaim her sovereignty and restore lost stability to the kingdom. The next day, September 25, the Cortes issued a declaration pledging to use arms if necessary and for the whole to aid any one city that was threatened. On September 26, the Cortes of Tordesillas declared itself the new legitimate government and denounced the Royal Council. Oaths of self-defense were taken by all the cities represented over the week, finishing by September 30. The revolutionary government now had structure and a free hand to act, with the Royal Council still ineffective and confused.Haliczer 1981, p. 179. =Scope of the rebellion= Bronze sculpture of Juan de Padilla in Toledo The comuneros were strong in the central plateau of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as scattered other places such as Murcia. The rebels sought to propound their revolutionary ideas to the rest of the kingdom, but without much success. There were few attempts at rebellion elsewhere, such as in Galicia to the northwest or in Andalusia to the south.P√©rez 2001, p. 146‚Äì147. Comunidades in the south were set up in Ja√©n, √öbeda, and Baeza, unique in Andalusia, but with time they were drawn back into the royalists. Murcia stayed with the rebel cause, but did not coordinate much with the Junta, and the rebellion there had a character closer to the nearby Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Valencia in Aragon.P√©rez 2001, p. 155. In Extremadura to the southwest, the city of Plasencia joined the Comunidades, but this was undermined by the close proximity of other royalist cities such as Ciudad Rodrigo and C√°ceres. A close correlation can be drawn between poor economic fortunes over the previous twenty years and the rebellion; central Castile suffered from agricultural failure and other setbacks under the Royal Council, while Andalusia was relatively prosperous with its maritime trade. Andalusia's leadership also feared that in the instability of a civil war, the Moriscos of Granada would likely revolt.Haliczer 1981, p. 183, 205. Popular and governmental response Adrian of Utrecht, future Pope Adrian VI, was considered an effective regent despite the difficult situation. He spearheaded the recruitment of nobility to the royalist side, and two Castilian co-regents were appointed to lessen the appearance of foreign control. =Turning of the nobles= The growing success of the comuneros emboldened people to accuse members of the old government of complicity with royal abuses. The protests attacked the landed nobility as well, many of whom had illegally taken property during the reign of the regents and weak kings after Isabella's death. In Due√±as, the Count of Buend√≠a's vassals revolted against him on September 1, 1520, encouraged by rebel monks. This uprising was followed by others of a similar anti-feudal nature.P√©rez 2001, p. 65. The leadership of the comuneros was forced to take a stance on these new rebellions; reluctant to openly endorse them, the Junta initially denounced them but did nothing to oppose them.Seaver 1928, p. 306. The dynamics of the uprising thus changed profoundly, as it could now jeopardize the status of the entire manorial system. The nobles had previously been somewhat sympathetic to the cause due to their loss of privileges to the central government. However, these new developments lead to a dramatic drop in support for the comuneros from aristocrats, who were frightened by the more radical elements of the revolution.Haliczer 1981, p. 185. =Response of Charles I= At first, Charles seemed not to grasp the magnitude of the revolt. He continued to demand payments from Castile; with the government of Castile still in arrears, Cardinal Adrian found it impossible to secure any new loans. A letter from Cardinal Adrian on August 25 warned Charles of the severity of the situation: Once he realized that a full-fledged revolution was underway, Charles responded vigorously. Through Cardinal Adrian, he undertook new policy initiatives, such as canceling the taxes granted in the Cortes of Corunna. Most important was the appointment of two new Castilian co-regents: the Constable of Castile, √ç√±igo Fern√°ndez, and the Admiral of Castile, Fadrique Enr√≠quez.Seaver 1928, p. 155‚Äì156. This negated two of the most salient complaints of the rebels. In addition, Adrian approached the nobles to convince them that their best interests lay with the king. The Royal Council was re-established in the fief of Admiral Enr√≠quez, Medina de Rioseco, which enabled the Council to be nearer to the revolting cities and reassure skeptical supporters.Seaver 1928, p. 163. While the royal army was still in tatters, many high nobles maintained their own well-trained mercenary armies‚Äîarmies that with the revolt's recent radicalization would now fight for the king. Organization, funding, and diplomacy The first political defeats of the comuneros came in October 1520. The comuneros' attempt to use Queen Joanna for legitimacy did not bear fruit, as she blocked their initiatives and refused to sign any edicts.Haliczer 1981, p. 156. In turn, dissenting voices inside the comuneros now began to be heard, especially in Burgos. The wavering position of Burgos was soon known to the royalists, and the Constable of Castile negotiated with Burgos's government. The Royal Council granted a number of significant concessions to Burgos in exchange for them leaving the Junta.Seaver 1928, p. 215. Following this incident, the Royal Council hoped that other cities would imitate Burgos and leave the comuneros peacefully. Valladolid, the former seat of royal power, was considered especially likely to turn, but too many supporters of the king had left city politics and lost their influence. It remained rebel-controlled.Seaver 1928, p. 179. The Admiral of Castile continued his campaign to try to convince the comuneros to return to the royal government and thereby avoid a violent suppression.Seaver 1928, p. 192‚Äì195. This attitude concealed a great shortage of funds on the royal side.Haliczer 1981, p. 181. During October and November 1520, both sides accepted that a military conclusion would soon be necessary and actively devoted themselves to fundraising, recruiting soldiers, and training their troops. The comuneros organized their militias in the major cities and levied new taxes on the countryside; they also took measures aimed at eliminating waste, routinely auditing their treasurers and dismissing those thought to be corrupt.Haliczer 1981, p. 170. The royal government, which had lost much of its revenue due to the revolt, sought loans from Portugal and from conservative Castilian bankers, who saw reassuring signs in the switch of the allegiance of Burgos. Battle of Tordesillas =Leadership disputes= Constable of Castile's son, the Count of Haro, consisted of 6,000 infantry, 2,100 cavalry, and 12‚Äì15 artillery pieces. Pedro Gir√≥n's rebel force was larger but slower, with 10,000 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 13 artillery pieces. The rebels' deficiency in cavalry would hurt them throughout the war. Gradually, both the city of Toledo and its leader Juan L√≥pez de Padilla lost influence within the Junta, though Padilla retained popularity and prestige among the commoners. Two new figures emerged within the Comunidades, Pedro Gir√≥n and Antonio Osorio de Acu√±a. Gir√≥n was one of the most powerful nobles who supported the comuneros; his rebellion is thought to originate from Charles' refusal to grant Gir√≥n the prestigious Duchy of Medina-Sidonia a year prior to the war. Antonio de Acu√±a was the Bishop of Zamora. Acu√±a was also the head of the Comunidad in Zamora and the leader of its army, which included more than 300 priests.P√©rez 2001, p. 75.Guilarte 1983. On the royalist side, the nobles could not agree on what tactics to use. Some preferred to directly challenge the rebels in combat, while others such as the Constable of Castile favored continued waiting and the building of defensive fortifications. The Admiral of Castile preferred negotiations and exhausting all the possible peaceful options first.Lynch 1964, p. 40. Patience, however, began to run thin; armies were expensive to maintain once assembled. In late November 1520, both armies took positions between Medina de Rioseco and Tordesillas, and a confrontation was inevitable.P√©rez 2001, p. 78. =Royal capture= With Pedro Gir√≥n in command, the army of the comuneros advanced on Medina de Rioseco, following the orders of the Junta. Gir√≥n established his headquarters in Villabr√°gima, a town merely from the royalist army. The royalists occupied nearby villages to cut communication lines back to other comuneros. This situation continued until December 2, when Gir√≥n, apparently thinking the royal army would remain entrenched, moved his forces west to the small town of Villalpando.Haliczer 1981, p. 189 The town surrendered the next day without resistance, and the troops began looting the estates in the area. However, with this movement, the comuneros left the path to Tordesillas completely unprotected. The royal army took advantage of the blunder, marching by night on December 4 and occupying Tordesillas the next day. The small rebel garrison was overwhelmed.Seaver 1928, p. 200‚Äì202. Seizure of Tordesillas marked a serious defeat for the comuneros, who lost Queen Joanna and with her their claim to legitimacy. In addition, thirteen representatives of the Junta were imprisoned, though others fled and escaped. Morale fell among the rebels, and much angry criticism was directed towards Pedro Gir√≥n for his maneuvering of the troops out of position and for his failure to attempt to retake Tordesillas or capture Medina de Rioseco. Gir√≥n was obliged to resign from his post and withdrew from the war.Seaver 1928, p. 206. Events of December and January =Reorganization of the comuneros= Following the loss of Tordesillas, the comuneros regrouped in Valladolid. The Junta reconvened on December 15, but with only eleven cities represented, down from a height of fourteen. Soria and Guadalajara's representatives did not return, and Burgos had left earlier.P√©rez 1970, p. 262. Note that the original Junta of Tordesillas had thirteen cities represented, not fourteen; Murcia joined later. Valladolid would be the third capital of the rebels, after √Åvila and Tordesillas.P√©rez 2001, p. 95 The situation was somewhat worse for the army, with a large number of desertions in Valladolid and Villalpando. This forced the rebels to intensify their recruitment drives, especially in Toledo, Salamanca, and Valladolid itself. With these new recruits and the arrival of Juan de Padilla to Valladolid, the rebel military apparatus was rebuilt and morale bolstered. At the beginning of 1521, the comuneros prepared for an all- out war, despite disagreements within the movement. Some suggested seeking a peaceful resolution, while others favored continuing the war. Those who favored war were divided between two tactics: occupy Simancas and Torrelobat√≥n, a less ambitious proposal defended by Pedro Laso de la Vega; or lay siege to Burgos, a tactic favored by Padilla.P√©rez 2001, p. 99 =Military initiatives in Palencia and Burgos= Arco de Santa Mar√≠a in Burgos, one of the few cities loyal to the king on the Iberian plateau In the far north of Castile, the rebel army began a series of operations conducted by Antonio de Acu√±a, bishop of Zamora. They received orders from the Junta on December 23 to try and raise a rebellion in Palencia. They were tasked with expelling royalists, collecting taxes on behalf of the Junta, and creating an administration sympathetic to the comuneros cause. Acu√±a's army made a series of raids into the area around Due√±as, raising more than 4,000 ducats and inspiring the peasantry. He returned to Valladolid in early 1521, then came back to Due√±as on January 10 to begin a major offensive against the nobles of Tierra de Campos. The nobles' land and holdings were completely devastated. In mid-January, Pedro de Ayala, Count of Salvatierra, joined the comuneros and organized an army of about two thousand men who set about raiding the north of Castile.Seaver 1928, p. 294 Nearby, Burgos awaited the fulfillment of the pledges made by Cardinal Adrian after they had joined the royalist cause two months prior. The slow response led to dissatisfaction and uncertainty in the city. Ayala and Acu√±a, aware of this situation, decided to besiege Burgos, Ayala from its north and Acu√±a from its south. They also sought to undermine the defenses by encouraging a revolt of the inhabitants of Burgos.P√©rez 2001, p. 105 =Royalist response= Still in Germany, Charles V issued the Edict of Worms on December 17, 1520 (not to be confused with the Edict of Worms of May 25, 1521, against Martin Luther), which condemned 249 prominent Comunidad members. For secular rebels, the punishment was death; clergy were to receive lighter penalties. Similarly, the edict also declared that those who supported the Comunidades were traitors, disloyal, rebels, and infidels. The Royal Council's next move was the occupation of Ampudia in Palencia, a town loyal to the Count of Salvatierra. The Junta sent Padilla to meet Acu√±a; their combined force besieged the royal army at the castle of Mormoj√≥n. The royal army slipped away by nightfall, and Mormoj√≥n was forced to pay tribute to avoid being pillaged. Ampudia was recovered by the rebels the next day, January 16.Seaver 1928, p. 228, and P√©rez 2001, p. 104. The two accounts disagree on the amount of Mormoj√≥n's tribute: Seaver says 1,500 ducats, and P√©rez 2,000. Meanwhile, the rebellion in Burgos scheduled for January 23 was a failure due to poor coordination with the besieging army; it started two days early and was easily crushed. The comuneros of Burgos had to surrender, and this was the last rebellion to be seen in Castile. Rebel campaigns of early 1521 =Padilla's decision on the rebels' next move= The taking of the Castle of Torrelobat√≥n, built in the 13th century, provided a much-needed victory for the comuneros. The castle was renovated in 2007 and is now a tourist site. After abandoning the siege of Burgos due to the failure of its revolt, Padilla decided to return to Valladolid, while Acu√±a opted to resume his skirmishing and harassment of noble properties around Tierra de Campos. With this series of actions, Acu√±a intended to destroy or occupy the homes of the prominent nobles. The rebels now set themselves completely against the manorial system. This would be one of the strongest features of the second phase of the rebellion. After the recent setbacks suffered by the comuneros, Padilla realized that they needed a victory to raise morale. He decided to take Torrelobat√≥n and its castle. Torrelobat√≥n was a stronghold halfway between Tordesillas and Medina de Rioseco, and was very close to Valladolid. Taking it would grant the rebels an excellent fortress for launching military operations and remove a threat on Valladolid.Seaver 1928, p. 248. =Battle of Torrelobat√≥n= On February 21, 1521, the siege of Torrelobat√≥n began. Outnumbered, the town nevertheless resisted for four days, thanks to its walls. On February 25, the comuneros entered the town and subjected it to a massive looting spree as a reward to the troops. Only churches were spared.Seaver 1928, p. 251. The castle resisted for another two days. The comuneros then threatened to hang all of the inhabitants, at which point the castle surrendered. The defenders did secure an agreement to spare half of the goods inside the castle, thus avoiding further looting.P√©rez 2001, p. 107. \\"Los asaltantes amenzaron con ahorcar a todos los inhabitantes si no se rend√≠a.\\" The victory in Torrelobat√≥n lifted the spirits of the rebel camp while worrying the royalists about the rebel advance, exactly as Padilla hoped. The faith of the nobles in Cardinal Adrian was again shaken, as he was accused of having done nothing to avoid losing Torrelobat√≥n. The Constable of Castile began to send troops to the Tordesillas area to contain the rebels and prevent any further advances.P√©rez 2001, p. 110. Despite the renewed enthusiasm among the rebels, a decision was made to remain in their positions near Valladolid without pressing their advantage or launching a new attack. This caused many of the soldiers to return to their home communities, tired of waiting for salaries and new orders.P√©rez 2001, p. 109. This was a problem the comunero forces had throughout the war; they possessed only a small number of full-time soldiers, and their militias were constantly \\"dissolving and recruiting.\\"Seaver 1928, p. 319. A serious attempt to negotiate a peaceful end to the war was tried again by the moderates, but was undercut by extremists of both sides.Seaver 1928, p. 278. In the north, after the failure of the siege of Burgos in January, the Count of Salvatierra resumed his campaign. He set off to cause an uprising in Merindades, the homeland of the Constable of Castile, and besieged Medina de Pomar and Fr√≠as. =Acu√±a's southern campaign= Mora, completely reconstructed after royalist troops set fire to it while 50 refugees took shelter inside. The royalist commander Prior Z√∫√±iga denied responsibility. William de Cro√ø, the young Flemish Archbishop of Toledo appointed by Charles, died in January 1521 in Worms, Germany. In Valladolid, the Junta proposed to Antonio de Acu√±a that he submit himself as a candidate for the seat. Acu√±a departed for Toledo in February with a small force under his command. He traveled south, declaring his impending claim on the archdiocese to every village as he passed. This raised enthusiasm among the commoners, who received him with cheers, but aroused suspicion in the aristocracy. They feared Acu√±a might attack their holdings as he did in Tierra de Campos. The Marquis of Villena and Duke of Infantado contacted Acu√±a and persuaded him to sign a pact of mutual neutrality.P√©rez 2001, p. 114‚Äì115. Acu√±a soon had to confront Antonio de Z√∫√±iga, who had been appointed commander of the royalist army in the Toledo area. Z√∫√±iga was a prior in the Knights of St. John, who maintained a base in Castile at the time.P√©rez 2001, p. 116 Acu√±a received information that Z√∫√±iga was in the area of Corral de Almaguer, and pursued battle with him near Tembleque. Z√∫√±iga drove the rebel forces off, and then launched a counterattack of his own between Lillo and El Romeral, inflicting a crushing defeat on Acu√±a. Acu√±a, a relentless self-promoter, tried to minimize the loss and even claimed that he had emerged victorious from the confrontation.Seaver 1928, p. 332. Undaunted, Acu√±a continued into Toledo. He appeared at the Zocodover Plaza in the heart of the city on March 29, 1521, Good Friday. The crowd gathered around him and took him directly to the cathedral, claiming the archbishop's chair for him.Seaver 1928, p. 333‚Äì334. The next day he met with Mar√≠a Pacheco, wife of Juan de Padilla and de facto leader of the Toledo Comunidad in her husband's absence. A brief rivalry emerged between the two, but it was resolved after mutual attempts at reconciliation.P√©rez 2001, p. 120. Once settled in the archdiocese of Toledo, Acu√±a began to recruit any men he could find, enlisting soldiers from fifteen to sixty years old. After royalist troops burned the town of Mora on April 12, Acu√±a returned to the countryside with roughly 1,500 men under his command. He moved into Yepes, and from there conducted raids and operations against royalist-controlled rural areas. He first attacked and pillaged Villaseca de la Sagra, then faced Z√∫√±iga again in an inconclusive battle near the Tagus river in Illescas.P√©rez 2001, p. 122. Light skirmishing near Toledo would continue until news of Villalar ended the war. Battle of Villalar A 19th century work by Manuel Picolo L√≥pez depicting the Battle of Villalar In early April 1521, the royalist side moved to combine their armies and threaten Torrelobat√≥n. The Constable of Castile moved his troops (including soldiers recently transferred from the defense of Navarre) southwest from Burgos to meet with the Admiral's forces near Tordesillas. Meanwhile, the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobat√≥n, which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred. Their forces were suffering from desertions, and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobat√≥n's castle vulnerable. Juan L√≥pez de Padilla considered withdrawing to Toro to seek reinforcements in early April, but wavered. He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23, losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in Pe√±aflor.Seaver 1928, p. 324‚Äì325.P√©rez 1970, p. 313‚Äì314. The combined royalist army pursued the comuneros. Again, the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry, with their army consisting of 6,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry against Padilla's 7,000 infantry and 400 cavalry. Heavy rain slowed Padilla's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels' 1,000 arquebusiers nearly useless. Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of Vega de Valdetronco, but his infantry was too slow. He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar. The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks, and the battle became a slaughter. There were an estimated 500‚Äì1,000 rebel casualties and many desertions. The three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured: Juan L√≥pez de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado. They were beheaded the next morning in the Plaza of Villalar, with a large portion of the royalist nobility present.P√©rez 2001, p. 111. The remains of the rebel army at Villalar fragmented, with some attempting to join Acu√±a's army near Toledo and others deserting. The rebellion had been struck a crippling blow.Haliczer 1981, p. 204. End of the war After the Battle of Villalar, the towns of northern Castile soon succumbed to the king's troops, with all its cities returning their allegiance to the king by early May. Only Madrid and Toledo kept their Comunidades alive. =Resistance of Toledo= Mar√≠a Pacheco receives notice of the death of her husband at Villalar. The painting is a 19th-century work by Vicente Borr√°s. The first news of Villalar arrived in Toledo on April 26, but was largely ignored by the local Comunidad. The magnitude of the defeat became apparent in a few days, after the first survivors began arriving in the city and confirmed the fact that the three rebel leaders had been executed. Toledo was declared in mourning over the death of Juan de Padilla.P√©rez 2001, p. 123. After the death of Padilla, Bishop Acu√±a lost popularity in favour of Mar√≠a Pacheco, Padilla's widow.P√©rez 2001, p. 128. People began to suggest negotiating with the royalists, seeking to avoid further suffering in the city. The situation looked even worse after the surrender of Madrid on May 11.Seaver 1928, p. 339. The fall of Toledo seemed only to be a matter of time. However, one ray of hope remained for the rebels. Castile had withdrawn some of its troops from occupied Navarre to fight the comuneros, and King Francis I of France used the opportunity to invade with support from the Navarrese. The royalist army was forced to march on Navarre to respond rather than besiege Toledo. Acu√±a left Toledo to travel to Navarre, but he was recognized and caught. It is disputed whether he was seeking to join the French and continue fighting, or was simply fleeing.Seaver 1928, p. 336. Mar√≠a Pacheco took control of the city and the remains of the rebel army, living in the Alc√°zar, collecting taxes, and strengthening defenses. She requested the intervention of her uncle, the respected Marquis of Villena, to negotiate with the Royal Council, hoping he would be able to obtain better concessions. The Marquis eventually abandoned the negotiations, and Mar√≠a Pacheco took on personal negotiations with Prior Z√∫√±iga, the commander of the besieging forces. Her demands, though somewhat galling to honor, were ultimately minor, such as guaranteeing the property and reputation of her children.Seaver 1928, p. 346‚Äì347. Still concerned about the French, the royal government gave in. With the support of all parties, the surrender of Toledo was orchestrated on October 25, 1521. Thus, on October 31 the comuneros left the Alc√°zar of Toledo and new officials were appointed to run the city. The truce guaranteed the freedom and property of all the comuneros. =Revolt of February 1522= The new administrator of Toledo restored order and brought the city back under royal control. However, he also provoked former comuneros.P√©rez 2001, p. 131. Mar√≠a Pacheco continued her presence in the city and refused to hand over all the hidden weapons until Charles V personally signed the agreements reached with the Order of St. John. This unstable situation came to an end on February 3, 1522, when the generous terms of the surrender were annulled. Royal soldiers filled the city and the administrator ordered Pacheco's execution. Riots broke out in protest. The incident was temporarily remedied thanks to the intervention of Mar√≠a de Mendoza, the sister of Mar√≠a Pacheco. Another truce was granted, and while the former comuneros were defeated, the distraction was exploited by Mar√≠a Pacheco to escape to Portugal disguised as a farmer.Seaver 1928, p. 348. =Pardon of 1522= Charles V returned to Spain on July 16, 1522.Seaver 1928, p. 350. Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically. Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much.Haliczer 1981, p. 212. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1.P√©rez 2001, p. 136. The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros, a small figure given the huge number of rebels. Both Pacheco and Bishop Acu√±a were among the 293 excluded from the pardon. More pardons were issued later, after pressure from the Cortes; by 1527, the repression was completely at end. Of the 293, 23 were executed, 20 died in prison, 50 purchased amnesty, and 100 were pardoned later. The fates of the rest are unknown. Aftermath Mar√≠a Pacheco successfully escaped to Portugal, where she lived in exile the remaining ten years of her life. Bishop Acu√±a, captured in Navarre, was stripped of his ecclesiastical standing and executed after he killed a guard while trying to escape.Seaver 1928, p. 357. Pedro Gir√≥n received a pardon conditional on him going into exile to Oran in North Africa, where he served as a commander against the Moors.Seaver 1928, p. 354. Queen Joanna was locked in Tordesillas by her son. She would remain there for thirty-five years, the rest of her life.Seaver 1928, p. 359. Emperor Charles V would go on to rule one of the largest and most sprawling empires in European history. As a consequence, Charles was nearly constantly at war, fighting France, England, the Papal States, the Ottoman Turks, the Aztecs, the Incas, and the Protestant Schmalkaldic League during his reign. Spain would provide the bulk of the Habsburgs' armies and financial resources over this period. Charles placed Castilians in high governmental positions in both Castile and the Empire at large, and generally left the administration of Castile in Castilian hands. In that sense, the revolt could be considered successful.Lynch 1964, p. 46. Some of the reforms of Isabella I which reduced noble power were reversed as a price for luring the nobility to the royalist side. However, Charles understood that noble encroachment of power had helped cause the revolt, and embarked upon a new reform program. Unpopular, corrupt, and ineffective officials were replaced; judicial functions of the Royal Council were limited; and local courts were revitalized. Charles also adjusted the membership of the Royal Council; its hated president was replaced, the aristocracy's role reduced, and more gentry were added to it.Haliczer 1981, p. 213.Lynch 1964, p. 48. Realizing that the urban elite needed to have a stake in the royal government once more, Charles gave many of them positions, privileges, and government salaries.Haliczer 1981, p. 218. The program was called \\"Stewards and gentlemen,\\" and about 400 well-paid positions were handed out. The Cortes, while not as important as the comuneros had hoped, nevertheless maintained its power; it was still required to approve new taxes and could advise the king.Haliczer 1981, p. 220. Charles also discouraged his officials from using overly coercive methods, after seeing his heavy-handed treatment of the Cortes of Corunna backfire.Haliczer 1981, p. 223. If anything, the co-option of the middle class worked too well; when Charles' successor King Phillip II demanded a ruinously large tax increase in the 1580s, the Cortes was too dependent on the Crown for money to effectively resist policies that would wreck the economy.Haliczer 1981, p. 227. Later influence Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez, \\"El Empecinado\\" (\\"The Undaunted\\"), who tried to rehabilitate the reputation of the comuneros in 1821 The revolt, fresh in the memory of Spain, is referenced in several literary works during Spain's Golden Age. Don Quixote references the rebellion in a conversation with Sancho, and Francisco de Quevedo uses the word \\"comunero\\" as a synonym for \\"rebel\\" in his works.P√©rez 2001, p. 236. In the 18th century, the comuneros were not held in high regard by the Spanish Empire. The government was not amenable to encouraging rebellions, and only used the term to condemn opposition. In the Revolt of the Comuneros in Paraguay, the rebels did not take the name willingly; it was only meant to disparage them as traitors. Another Revolt of the Comuneros in New Granada (modern Colombia) was similarly unrelated to the original except in name. At the beginning of the 19th century, the image of the comuneros began to be rehabilitated by scholars such as Manuel Quintana as precursors of freedom and martyrs against absolutism.P√©rez 2001, p. 238. The decline of Castilian liberty was linked to the later decline of Spain.Haliczer 1981, p. 7. Haliczer is citing Guti√©rrez Nieto 1973, p. 57‚Äì58 for Quintana's views; p. 84 for Danvila's views; and p. 98 for Mara√±√≥n's views. The first major commemorative event came in 1821, the third centenary of the Battle of Villalar. Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez, a nationalistic liberal military leader who had fought in the resistance against Napoleon, led an expedition to find and exhume the remains of the three leaders executed in 1521. D√≠ez praised the comuneros on behalf of the liberal government in power at the time, likely the first positive governmental recognition for their cause. This view was challenged by conservatives who viewed a centralized state as modern and progressive, especially after the anarchy and fragmentation of the 1868 Revolution in Spain. Manuel Danvila, a conservative government minister, published the six- volume Historia critica y documentada de las Comunidades de Castilla from 1897 to 1900, one of the most important works of scholarship on the revolt.Seaver 1928, p. 376. Drawing on collected original sources, Danvila emphasized the fiscal demands of the comuneros, and cast them as traditionalist, reactionary, medieval, and feudal. Though a liberal, intellectual Gregorio Mara√±√≥n shared the dim view of the comuneros that again prevailed in Spain; he cast the conflict as one between a modern, progressive state open to beneficent foreign influence against a conservative, reactionary, and xenophobic Spain hypersensitive to religious and cultural deviance with an insistence on spurious racial purity. A floral offering at Villalar, on Castile and Le√≥n Day, April 23, 2006 General Franco's government from 1939 to 1975 also encouraged an unfavorable interpretation of the comuneros. According to approved historians such as Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n, the revolt was fundamentally an issue of petty Spanish regionalism, something which Franco did his best to discourage. Additionally, the comuneros did not properly appreciate Spain's \\"imperial destiny.\\"Guti√©rrez Nieto 1973, p. 96. Nieto is referring to Pem√°n's Breve Historia a Espa√±a, p. 208‚Äì211. Since the mid-twentieth century, others have sought more materialist reasons for the revolt. Historians such as Jos√© Antonio Maravall and Joseph P√©rez portray the developing revolt as alliances of different social coalitions around shifting economic interests, with the \\"industrial bourgeoisie\\" of artisans and woolworkers combining with the intellectuals and the low nobility against the aristocrats and the merchants.Haliczer 1981, p. 8. Haliczer is citing P√©rez 1970, p. 19. Maravall, who views the revolt as one of the first modern revolutions, especially stresses the ideological conflict and intellectual nature of the revolt, with features such as the first proposed written constitution of Castile.Haliczer 1981, p. 8. The April 23, 2007 gathering at Villalar. Villalar was renamed Villalar de los Comuneros in 1932, under the liberal Second Republic. With Spain's transition to democracy following Franco's death, celebration of the comuneros started to become permissible again. On April 23, 1976, a small ceremony was held clandestinely in Villalar; only two years later, in 1978, the event had become a huge demonstration of 200,000 in support of Castilian autonomy. The autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n was created in response to public demand in 1983, and it recognized April 23 as an official holiday in 1986. Similarly, each February 3 since 1988 has been celebrated by the Castilian nationalist party Tierra Comunera in Toledo. The celebration highlights the roles of Juan L√≥pez de Padilla and Mar√≠a Pacheco, and is done in memory of the rebellion in 1522, the last event of the war.

In 1847, English dentist Edwin Truman (1819-1905) introduced gutta-percha as a material for making dental impressions; however, this was unsatisfactory for several reasons, including its tendency to distort upon removal from the patient's mouth, and to shrink upon cooling. In 1856, Stent added several other materials to the gutta- percha, notably stearine, which markedly improved the plasticity of the material as well as its stability. He also added talc as an inert filler to give more body to the material, and red colouring. The medical device called a stent derives its name from him. Charles Thomas Stent was born at Royal Crescent, Brighton, on 17 October 1807. He was the 6th son of William and Hannah (n√©e Jenkin) Stent.

Early life Sutherland was born on 19 December 1828 at Hamilton Place, London. He was the son of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland and Lady Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana Howard. He was educated at Eton College and King's College London. Career Sutherland was Liberal Member of Parliament for Sutherland from 1852 until he succeeded his father as Duke in 1861. He took part in a number of state occasions. He was one of the British delegation to the coronation of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1856, hosted the public visit by Garibaldi to Britain in 1864, attended the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and accompanied the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) on his state visit to India in 1876. He was Lord Lieutenant for the county of Cromarty from 1852 until the role was abolished in 1891, and Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland form 1861 until his death. Sutherland chaired a committee that organised charitable work to help those involved with the Turko-Russian and Zulu wars. =Military positions and honours= Sutherland was Colonel of the Sutherland Regiment of Highland Volunteers from 1864 to 1882, and of the 20th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps (Railway Rifles) in 1867. He was awarded Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1859. He was made KG in 1864, and FRS in 1870. He was a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer of Greece. Railway interests The Third Duke played a key role in the early history of the Highland Railway, being a founder board member of the company and contributing extensively towards the Sutherland Railway, building the Duke of Sutherland's Railway out of his own pocket and also supporting the Sutherland and Caithness Railway. The Highland Railway operated these lines, absorbing them in 1884. He was President of the Mont Cenis Railway Company which built the first Fell railway and operated it from 1868‚Äì1871 to provide a temporary route over the Alps for rail passengers from Calais to Brindisi until the completion of the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel.P.

Together, they had five children: * George Granville Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Earl Gower (1850‚Äì1858), who died young. * Cromartie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 4th Duke of Sutherland (1851‚Äì1913) * Francis Mackenzie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl of Cromartie (1852‚Äì1893) * Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1855‚Äì1881), who married Henry Chaplin, 1st Viscount Chaplin and had issue. * Lady Alexandra Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1866‚Äì1891), who died unmarried. Sutherland was estranged from his wife Anne for many years before her death in November 1888. Less than four months after her death, Sutherland married, on 4 March 1889, Mary Caroline (n√©e Michell) Blair, with the Bishop of Florida, Edwin Garner Weed, officiating. causing a scandal as the conventional minimum period between the death of a spouse and remarriage being one year. Mary was the daughter of Rev. Richard Michell, DD, and the widow of Captain Arthur Kindersley Blair, formerly of the 71st Highland Light Infantry. Blair had resigned his commission in the Highlanders in 1861 and worked as a land agent and business manager for Sutherland; Mrs. Blair became Sutherland's mistress, and although Blair's death in 1883 was officially recorded as accidental, there was considerable speculation, at the time and later, that it may have been suicide or even murder. The 3rd Duke of Sutherland died, aged sixty-three, at Dunrobin Castle, and was buried on 29 September 1892 at Trentham in Staffordshire. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest surviving son, Cromartie. Their second, Francis, had succeeded to his wife's titles as the 2nd Earl of Cromartie upon her death in 1888. =Estate= Shortly before his death, Sutherland effectively disinherited his natural heirs and tried to leave all his money to his second wife, who was later found guilty of destroying documents and was imprisoned for six weeks. The family later made a substantial settlement in her favour, enabling her to build Carbisdale Castle between 1906 and 1917. Prior to this, she had resided at Sutherland Grange at Dedworth adjoining Windsor in Berkshire. Sutherland's widow, known as Duchess Blair, married thirdly on 12 November 1896 (sep 1904) as his second wife Sir Albert Kaye Rollit (1842‚Äì1922), MP for Islington South.

Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights concludes final session, United Nations press release, 25 August 2006 among the recommendations it adopted at that session was one for the creation of a human rights consultative committee as a standing body to assist the Human Rights Council.UN ‚Äòthink tank‚Äô winds up by proposing expert body to advise Human Rights Council Organisation The Sub-Commission was first formed in 1947, under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Its primary mandate is described as: * \\"To undertake studies, particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to make recommendations to the Commission concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial, national, religious and linguistic minorities\\". Other functions and tasks could also be assigned to it by ECOSOC or the Commission on Human Rights. It was composed of 26 human rights experts, each with an alternate and each elected for a term of four years, with half of the posts up for election every two years. Membership was selected from amongst the eligible candidates from United Nations member states in such a way as to result in roughly equal and proportional representation from each of the continents. As of 2004, the breakdown of membership was: * 7 from African States, * 5 from Asian States, * 5 from Latin American States, * 3 from Eastern European States, * 6 from Western European and other States. The Sub-Commission had eight working groups to conduct studies on discriminatory practices and make recommendations to ensure that racial, national, religious and linguistic minorities were protected by law. * Working Group on Administration of Justice * Working Group on Communication * Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery * Working Group on Indigenous Populations * Working Group on Minorities * Working Group on Social Forum * Working Group on Transnational Corporations * Working Group on Terrorism Genocide By the middle of the 1970s the Genocide Convention had not been ratified by all of the members of the security council and appeared to be moribund after 20 years of inaction. Members of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities decided to investigate the subject and over the next decade launched a number of initiatives.Inazumi, p. 72 which included publication of the Ruhashyankiko report in 1978 and the Whitaker report in 1985. =Ruhashyankiko Report= Nicod√®me Ruhashyankiko was appointed as a special Rapporteur in 1973 and produced a report The Study on the Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, that was approved by the Sub-Commission at its thirty first session (E/CN.4/Sub.2/416, 4 July 1979.Fournet, p. xi The report was forwarded to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) with a recommendation that it be given the widest possible distribution, and the UNCHR made a decision to do so.Schabas, p.466 footnote 124 citing UNCHR Decision 9 (XXXV). Much of Ruhashyankiko's report was not found by the sub- committee to be controversial, for example his suggestion that the crime of genocide, like the crime of piracy, should be covered by universal jurisdiction,Inazumi, pp. 72,75 and that an international criminal court be set up to try those accused of genocide.Schabas, p. 465 However, as his review of historical genocide ignited a political debate, Ruhashyankiko took the conservative line that it was impossible to draw up an exhaustive list and that attempting to do so could reignite old quarrels and be unacceptable to all of the member states of the United Nations. This drew the criticism of one member of the Sub-Commission who complained that \\"genocide of the Palestinians\\" had been omitted. But most of the criticism was for a change Ruhashyankiko made between the first draft and the final version of the report. The first draft had cited the Armenian genocide, but that reference was deleted from the final version due to pressure from Turkey,Thornberry, id=ABkguIKXqkUC&pg;=PA64&lpg;=PA64&dq;=Ruhashyankiko+report&source;=bl&ots;=o18E41aVLi&sig;=hDOK42qGPOto8W_Q8OJlbwvfL2w&hl;=en&ei;=ywICSujbKJe8jAeCvuTyBg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=9 p. 64 footnote 27 an omission that was supported by only one member. Ruhashyankiko justified his omission of the Armenian genocide and the inclusion of the Jewish genocide by explaining that the Holocaust was universally recognised while the Armenian genocide was not. In the end the Sub-Commission sent the report with some amendments resulting from the debate within the Sub-Commission to the (UNCHR) with a recommendation that it should be widely distributed. Although the UNCHR accepted the recommendation and passed the resolution to enable its distribution, the foreseen distribution never took place, leaving copies of the report to be found only in the research libraries of some major universitiesSchabas, p. 466 Mitsue Inazumi draws the conclusion from the political debate that the Ruhashyankiko report started, that it was evocative of how divisive the dispute over historical genocides and alleged historical genocides is, while William Schabas draws the conclusion that Ruhashyankiko backed down in naming the Armenian massacres as a genocide under the pressure from the Turkish state, and that \\"Ruhashyankiko's unpardonable wavering on the Armenian genocide cast a shadow over what was otherwise an extremely helpful and well-researched report\\". =Whitaker Report= By 1982, persisting hostility to Ruhashyankiko's handling of the Armenian issue led the Sub-Commission to consider a new report on genocide.Schabas, p. 466 In 1983, it requested that the Commission On Human Rights ask the Economic and Social Council [ECOSOC] to appoint a new Special Rapporteur to undertake the task. Sub-Commission member Benjamin Whitaker of the United Kingdom was appointed to the position and mandated to write a revised, updated study.Schabas p. 466, footnote 126 UNCHR Res 1983/24, & ECOSOC Res 1983/33 His study, Revised and Updated Report on th√® Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, was received and noted by a resolution at the thirty-eighth session of the Sub-Commission in 1985.

It made a number of controversial proposals including recommendations that the Genocide Convention should be altered to include protection of groups based on politics and sexual orientation. Also \\"advertent omission\\" should become a crime and the defence of obeying superior orders should be removed. The report also suggested that consideration should be given to ecocide, ethnocide and cultural genocide.Schabas, p. 467 The report created further controversy,Schabas, p. 466 because in paragraph 24 it stated that In the debates over whether to accept the report the Sub-Commission's final report stated: That opinions of the Sub-Commission were split came to the fore over the wording of the resolution to accept the report. In the end the second and weaker of two proposed resolutions was adopted, one that took note of the study and thanked Whitaker for his efforts and also noted \\"that divergent opinions have been expressed about the content and proposals of the report\\".Schabas 467, footnotes 135 & 137\\\\. Footnote 135: UN Doc E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/SR.36/Add.1,paragraph 21. Footnote 137: UN Doc E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/SR.36/Add.1,paragraph 57. Schabas states that \\"An attempt to strengthen the resolution by expressing the Sub-Commissions's thanks and congratulations for 'some' of the proposals in the report was resoundingly defeated\\".Schabas 467, citing footnote 137 UN Doc E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/SR.36/Add.1,para. 57.The sources are somewhat split on this interpretation of the Sub-Commission's response to the Whitaker Report with some stating that the report was endorsed: and others stating it was not: =1990s= The Sub-Commission revisited genocide in 1993 and in 1994 recommended that an international court statute be prepared to facilitate the prosecution of genocide. It also recommended that an international committee be created to examine reports by States into their undertakings under Article 5 of the Genocide Convention. The committee also followed up on one of the Ruhashyankiko Reports ideas and suggested that the convention be improved by including a clause enabling the crime of genocide to be tried under universal jurisdiction.Schabas, p. 468 In a resolution dated 3 August 1995 the Sub- Commission concluded \\"that a veritable genocide is being committed massively and in a systematic manner against the civilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina, often in the presence of United Nations forces\\".Sub-Commission resolution 1995/1 6th meeting 3 August 1995 Later the same month on 18 August, the Sub-Commission passed another resolution explicitly mentioning Radio D√©mocratie-La Voix du Peuple, which had been stirring up genocidal hatred in Burundi.Prevention of incitement to hatred and genocide, particularly by the media, Sub-Commission resolution 1995/4 27th meeting 18 August 1995 Human rights and weapons of mass destruction The Sub-Commission, passed two motions ‚Äî the first in 1996 and the second in 1997. They listed weapons of mass destruction, or weapons with indiscriminate effect, or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and urged all states to curb the production and the spread of such weapons. The committee authorized a working paper, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, of the weapons. The requested UN working paper was delivered in 2002(backup) \\"In its decision 2001/36 of 16 August 2001, the Sub-Commission, recalling its resolutions 1997/36 and 1997/37 of 28 August 1997, authorized Mr. Y.K.J.

This event showcases the diversity of customs of the many established communities of immigrants that live in the city and around. It is locally known simply as las Colectividades, and usually held in the middle of spring (the first days of November), though in 2004 it was celebrated in December instead, to avoid overlapping with the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language (held in Rosario in mid- November). Tents, kiosks and several performing stages are set up in the National Flag Park (Parque Nacional a la Bandera), a large expanse on the shore of the Paran√° River, right opposite the National Flag Memorial. Immigrant communities devote their space to selling typical foods and drinks, as well as other items, or for exhibits. The stages are devoted to the performance of dances and music. The festival is attended every year by tens of thousands of local residents and tourists. In recent years, the Colectividades were marred by poor organization and abuse on the part of some communities, which in effect turned their spaces into common open-air bars and barbecues. Alcohol abuse by some attenders, robberies, problems with public transportation and traffic congestion in the area of the festival caused many people to complain or to miss the celebration altogether. In light of this and the recently increased touristic flow into the city, for 2005 the municipal government added special requirements for the communities' exhibits, such as a percentage of space to be devoted to cultural activities and the sale of typical foods only, and a change of the layout. The 2005 celebration was, accordingly, deemed better organized and safer than the previous ones, and attendance during its ten days reached about 1 million.

His brief return to DC also included a brief run on Superman/Batman. His next work for Image Comics, with Mike Huddleston on art duties, was Butcher Baker: The Righteous Maker. The critically acclaimed series ended with issue #8, which was published on August 15, 2012, ten months after issue #7, a delay that Casey stated was due to Huddleston's having overcommitted himself. Huddleston responded to Casey's public statement by stating that the delay was caused by his need to take over work in order to make sufficient money, as Butcher Baker was not lucrative enough for him to avoid doing so. Huddleston further explained that he apologized to Casey and to fans for the delay.Melrose, Kevin (August 15, 2012). \\"Butcher Baker, The Righteous Maker has ended, apparently\\".Callahan, Timothy (August 13, 2012). \\"When Words Collide: Joe Casey Talks: The Return of 'Butcher Baker'\\".

The frame may be a basic piece of wooden furniture prior to its being upholstered. Like a finished piece of furniture prior to the upholstering, the frame establishes the final quality, including its durability, and sets limits upon the final design, padding, cushioning, or cover. Materials Sofa designed for Dal√≠ in 1935 Frames are made variously of solid wood, engineered wood products, a variety of polymers and metals, or a mixture of these. Solid wood for upholstery frames may be of various kinds, including hardwoods and softwoods. The type of wood depends upon the final piece, including function, style, and quality. Where parts of the frame are visible afterwards, wood grades and species may be mixed. Hardwood destined for upholstery frames is primarily air-dried. Hardwood frames for high-end furniture are often constructed from kiln-dried mixed hardwoods. Beech, birch, white ash, and mahogany all have acceptable combinations of strength, availability (country dependent), workability, and cost to be superior wood products for frame making. White oak, red oak, and American elm are good, and hard maple is an acceptable framing wood. Softwoods can make poor frames, but are used in low end furniture manufacturing, particularly with partially upholstered frames on larger pieces in the United States. In Scandinavia, better quality softwoods are available and are used with suitable furniture making and upholstery techniques that their use is more common in furniture of a variety of qualities. Engineered wood products can be stronger than hardwood because layering methods increase the strength. They are sometimes used just at critical stress areas when maximum strength is needed. Modern furniture making, however, tends to rely upon a combination of engineered woods and solid woods in frame making. Engineered wood products commonly used in furniture making include plywood, hardboard, millboard, chipboard, and medium-density fiberboard. Upholstery itself is often applied with staples, and so metal frames will typically have a plywood panel inserted into them as a backer for the upholstery and to allow these staples to be pinned into it. Since lumber costs increase rapidly with increasing board thickness, some manufacturers may hold down frame costs by skimping at the precise point where ample strength is most important. The engineering principle involved is that strength varies directly with rail width and with the cube of thickness. If we assume that a certain 1\\" x 1\\" beam will sustain a load of 100 pounds, then a beam 1\\" thick and 2\\" wide will sustain 200 pounds. An old rule of thumb suggests that rails of 3\\" or more in width should be 1 1/8\\" thick, while rails less than 3\\" wide should exceed 11/8\\" in thickness. Construction Wooden frame joints are often double doweled, which means that round wooden pegs are fitted into holes in two adjacent frame sections and glued. Epoxy coated staples and gang nails are also commonly used. The gang nail is a metal plate with saw teeth, which immobilizes the joint when it is pressed into the wood with a hydraulic press. Major joints need the additional support of corner blocks, which should be glued and screwed into place.

May 1920 The Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (usually known simply as the PLM) was a French railway company. Created between 1858 and 1862 from the amalgamation of the earlier Paris-Lyon and Lyon-M√©diterran√©e companies, and subsequently incorporating a number of smaller railways, the PLM operated chiefly in the south-east of France, with a main line which connected Paris to the C√¥te d'Azur by way of Dijon, Lyon, and Marseille. The company was also the operator of railways in Algeria. PLM commissioned poster artist Roger Broders, sponsoring his travel to the C√¥te d'Azur and the French Alps so he could visit the subjects of his work. Lithographs of travel posters Broders rendered for PLM are still available commercially. Several of their draughtsmen went on to notable careers, including Alfred Gr√©vin. Absorbed in 1938 into the majority state-owned Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de fer Fran√ßais, the PLM's network became the south-eastern region of SNCF.

The facility, which opened in 1950, is home to three women's teams at the University of Kentucky ‚Äì basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics. Before Rupp Arena opened in 1976, it also housed the men's basketball team. Memorial Coliseum also housed the university's swimming and diving team prior to the 1989 completion of the Lancaster Aquatics Center. The facility was built as a memorial to Kentuckians who had died during World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Later, the names of all Kentuckians who died in the Vietnam War were added. Originally, it had an official capacity of 12,000, making it the largest arena in the South at the time. However, the Coliseum frequently drew crowds of over 13,000 for many UK basketball games. A major renovation, completed in 1990, reduced the seating capacity to its current total of 8,500 and added an elaborate weight training facility, new offices for the basketball and athletics programs, a players' lounge, and a team meeting room. The seating is now mostly located on the sidelines, and the men's NCAA basketball championship banners still hang on the walls. The building is known for its air of great tradition. While it was the home of the UK men's basketball team, it hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament ten times, four times as a regional site (1957, 1958, 1967, 1968) and six more as a sub- regional site (1955, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1967, 1975). As home to the University of Kentucky Wildcats, it saw two NCAA men's basketball national championship teams (1951, 1958), two NCAA men's basketball runner-up teams (1966, 1975), one NIT Men's Basketball champion (1976), and 16 Southeastern Conference (SEC) Men's Basketball regular season champions. Overall, in 26 seasons (1950‚Äì51 to 1975‚Äì76), the University of Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team posted a home record of 307‚Äì38 (.890). Memorial hosted a first-round game in the 2009 National Invitation Tournament on March 17, 2009 between the Wildcats and the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, with the Wildcats winning 70‚Äì60. The game was held at Memorial instead of Rupp Arena due to a scheduling conflict with the KHSAA boys' high school basketball state tournament scheduled at Rupp that week. The Coliseum was also the home of the Kentucky Boys' Sweet Sixteen State Basketball Tournament from 1951 to 1964. Since then, it has hosted numerous high school basketball tournaments over the years. The Coliseum stands across the street from the former site of Stoll Field/McLean Stadium, the football team's home before moving to the venue now known as Kroger Field in 1973. Prior to the building of the Coliseum, the Kentucky basketball teams played less than three blocks away at Alumni Gymnasium, a 2,800-seat arena built in 1924 and now converted to a student fitness center.

Background Sutherland was the eldest son of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland. He was born in London and educated at Eton College. Despite being very wealthy, Sutherland became concerned that his landed estates were no longer viable. Towards the end of his life he disposed of properties in the UK (such as Trentham Hall and Stafford House) and began moving his wealth to Canada.Duke of Sutherland dead, New York Times His political allegiance shifted from the Liberal Party to the Conservatives'. Military career As Marquess of Stafford, Sutherland entered the 2nd Life Guards as a cornet. He retired from regular army service as a lieutenant in 1875, but was commissioned Captain in the Staffordshire Yeomanry in 1876 and commanded that regiment as Lieutenant- Colonel from 1891 to 1898, after which he became its honorary colonel. He was also Lieutenant-Colonel of the Sutherland Rifles, a volunteer regiment of his ducal county in Scotland, from 1882 to 1891. From 1911 until his death he was honorary colonel of the 5th Territorial Force battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. He was President of the Staffordshire Territorial Forces Association from the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908. Political career Sutherland served as MP for Sutherland. On succeeding to his father's peerage in 1892, he became a member of the House of Lords, sitting on the Conservative benches. He also served as Mayor of Longton, near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in 1895‚Äì96, and was an alderman of the borough from 1898. Honours The Duke was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.

Plot synopsis Late at night, a deaf old man is the sole patron in a cafe. Nearby, two waiters, one young, the other older, talk about him. When the old man orders another brandy, the young waiter purposely overfills his glass. The waiters speculate about the old man's recent suicide attempt. The young waiter wants the patron to go home, and complains that he never gets to bed before three o'clock, while the older waiter is more understanding of the old man's plight. Again the old man asks for another brandy, but this time the young man tells him the cafe is closed. After he leaves, the waiters resume their discussion. The young waiter wants to hurry home to his wife; the older waiter is more thoughtful. He muses on youth and observes that he is now one \\"of those who like to stay late in the cafe,\\" likening himself to the old man. He mentions the importance to some people of having \\"a clean, well-lighted place\\" in which they can spend time. After the young waiter leaves, the older waiter reflects on the emptiness of his own life and returns to his home and his insomnia.  Historical reaction by other authors  James Joyce once remarked: \\"He [Hemingway] has reduced the veil between literature and life, which is what every writer strives to do. Have you read 'A Clean Well-Lighted Place'?...It is masterly. Indeed, it is one of the best short stories ever written...\\" \\"Lost Generation\\"  Discrepancies in the text  Scholars have noted issues with dialogue attribution within the text. F. P. Kroeger writes that \\"Hemingway, or someone, has been careless enough about this story so that at one time one main speaker seems to have information about the old man's suicide attempt which the other one does not have, and at another time the situation is reversed\\". William E. Colburn of Central Michigan College writes that \\"it becomes evident that one waiter knows about the customer's suicide attempt, but the other apparently does not. If it is the older waiter who knows, then why is it he who says, \\"'He has plenty of money'\\" in answer to the younger waiter's question, \\"'How do you know it was nothing?'\\" He elaborates that these inconsistencies have gone unnoticed by close readers for decades.

In 1969, the Observatory was renamed Lamont‚ÄìDoherty in honor of a major gift from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Charitable Foundation; in 1993, it was renamed the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory in recognition of its expertise in the broad range of Earth sciences. Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory is Columbia University's Earth sciences research center and is a core component of the Earth Institute, a collection of academic and research units within the university that together address complex environmental issues facing the planet and its inhabitants, with particular focus on advancing scientific research to support sustainable development and the needs of the world's poor.The Earth Institute To support its research and the work of the broader scientific community, Lamont‚ÄìDoherty operates the research vessel, the R/V Marcus Langseth, which is equipped to undertake a wide range of geological, seismological, oceanographic and biological studies. Lamont‚ÄìDoherty also houses the world's largest collection of deep-sea and ocean-sediment cores as well as many specialized research laboratories. Entrance to Columbia University's Lamont Campus on Rt. 9W in Palisades, N.Y.  Mission statement  The Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University is one of the world's leading research centers developing fundamental knowledge about the origin, evolution and future of the natural world. More than 300 research scientists and students study the planet from its deepest interior to the outer reaches of its atmosphere, on every continent and in every ocean. From global climate change to earthquakes, volcanoes, nonrenewable resources, environmental hazards and beyond, Observatory scientists provide a rational basis for the difficult choices facing humankind in the planet's stewardship.

Major divisions  = Biology and paleo environment = The Division of Biology and Paleo Environment (BPE) includes oceanographers, geologists, geochemists, biologists and environmental scientists who pursue research in two connected efforts. First, because all biological organisms record the environment in which they exist, BPE scientists use biology to uncover clues about earth's past environment. They also attempt to understand how modern environmental conditions affect present-day biology. To do this, BPE scientists turn to a number of primary sources, including deep-sea sediment cores (and the fossils of phytoplankton and zooplankton they contain), samples from coral reefs, and growth rings of trees. The Gary C. Comer Geochemistry Laboratory Building, home of the Geochemistry Division at the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory = Geochemistry = Researchers in the Division of Geochemistry study the processes, past and present, that have governed Earth's many environments. Using chemical and isotopic analyses, division scientists study samples of air, water, biological remains, rocks and meteorites in order to address a broad range of scientific issues, ranging from the particulate and chemical pollutants emitted by the collapse of the World Trade Center, to changes in Earth's past climate, to the fundamental chemical processes involved in the differentiation and formation of the planet's mantle and core. = Marine geology and geophysics = As its name implies, scientists in the Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics (MG&G;) are primarily concerned with studying the structure and evolution of the Earth's seafloor. To do so, they employ tools that include side-scan sonar and multi-channel seismic imaging to map the surface and sub-surface, as well as satellite-based remote sensing. An early success of MG&G; researchers was the discovery of seafloor spreading, which led to the general acceptance of plate tectonics as the broad foundation for understanding earthquake generation. Other MG&G; scientists study the interface between ice sheets and bedrock, sediment transport in the Hudson River, and meteorite impacts in the deep ocean. = Ocean and climate physics = The Division of Ocean and Climate Physics (OCP) focuses on the links between Earth's climate system and its oceans, including interactions involving the atmosphere, ocean circulation, planetary volcanism, the cryosphere, the biosphere and external forces such as variability of solar radiation and even the occasional asteroid impact. Scientists are also increasingly interested in understanding the nature of past and present changes to Earth's climate‚Äîwhether abrupt or gradual, regional or global‚Äîand the potential for human activities to influence the natural system.www.ldeo.columbia.edu = Division of seismology, geology and tectonophysics = The researchers in the Seismology, Geology and Tectonophysics Division (SGT) study theoretical and observational seismology, solid Earth dynamics, rock mechanics, structural geology and tectonics, and sedimentary geology. They also contribute to understanding of earthquakes; the structure of Earth's crust, mantle, and core; and the large-scale motions and deformation of the tectonic plates. In addition, the division operates several facilities for the scientific community. In partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey, SGT operates a network of seismographs throughout the northeastern U.S., supports National Science Foundation (NSF) efforts to conduct ocean-bottom seismology research, and provides accurate earthquake source mechanisms to government and academic researchers around the world. R/V Marcus G. Langseth, operated by the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory = Office of Marine Operations and R/V Marcus G. Langseth = The history of Lamont‚ÄìDoherty's seagoing research began in 1953 with the acquisition of the R/V Vema and the formation of a group within the Observatory to organize and support research missions. Today, the Office of Marine Operations oversees geophysical and oceanographic studies on board the Observatory's latest research vessel, the R/V Marcus Langseth, and conducts its own research on the character and operation of various geophysical imaging systems employed by the scientific community. = Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences = Robin Bell at her computer showing a mountain range found under the Antarctic ice. The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (DEES) is the educational arm of Columbia University located on the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty campus to train graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at the university and at Barnard College. The Lamont‚ÄìDoherty office of DEES primarily supports the department's graduate program, though many undergraduate students take classes and conduct research at the Observatory. At any given time, between 80 and 90 Ph.D. students are working towards degrees in specialties that include aqueous geochemistry, atmospheric science, climate science, ecophysiology, geology, paleoclimatology, paleontology, physical oceanography, solid Earth geophysics, and solid Earth geochemistry. Specific programs at Lamont‚ÄìDoherty are conducted with many education-affiliates at Columbia and elsewhere in the New York metro area..  Major facilities and initiatives  One of the 13,000+ physical samples housed in the Lamont Core Repository at the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory = Core Repository = The Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Core Repository is both an archive of sediment and rocks from on and beneath the ocean floor and an archive of digital data pertaining to the material. The repository contains more than 7,200 meters of core, from every ocean and sea, and many other samples. They are used to study Earth's climate and environment, in other research areas, and for educational purposes. = Tree Ring Lab = The Tree-Ring Lab (TRL) is dedicated to the application of tree-ring research around the world to improve understanding of Earth's past climate and environmental history. Current research concentrates on the use of tree-ring data networks to study regional climate, global climate teleconnections and anthropogenic impacts on tree growth, and on developing new quantitative techniques. = Ocean Bottom Seismology Lab = The Ocean Bottom Seismology (OBS) Lab develops and operates instruments used to measure deformation of the ocean floor in cooperation with the NSF's National Ocean Bottom Seismograph Instrumentation Pool (OBSIP). These instruments permit the study of such phenomena as seafloor spreading and the formation of new crust, convective and hydrothermal processes beneath the seafloor, and the fate of subducting slabs. = Lamont Cooperative Seismographic Network = The Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Cooperative Seismographic Network (LCSN) operates 40 seismographic stations in seven states‚ÄîConnecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont‚Äîto monitor earthquakes occurring primarily in the eastern U.S. The network is an active member of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), which is a key input to the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps. It also provides professional development among station operators. = Databases and repositories = Lamont‚ÄìDoherty is home to a wide range of geophysical databases and repositories that aid in scientific research, education and outreach. Many of the databases are available online, and the repositories of physical samples, which are open to access by researchers and students from around the world, also make an increasing portion of their holdings available digitally.

Following a massive fire in 1816, it was moved to Nizhny Novgorod, but for some decades thereafter it still was commonly referred to as Makaryev Fair. It attracted many foreign merchants from India, Iran, and Central Asia. According to Durland, a journalist who visited the fair in 1905, the fair dates from \\"before the discovery of America.\\" The fair was established by Muscovite princes to compete with, and draw commerce away from, a fair held since 1257, at Kazan, the Tartar capital. At the time Durland visited the fair, it consisted of 60 buildings, 2,500 bazaars and 8,000 exhibits, with goods for sale, along with a broad range of performances for the public. This fair was a commerce centre to sell up to half the total production of export goods in Russia. The fair ceased in 1929. A society named Nizhegorodskaya yarmarka (, Nizhny Novgorod fair) was created in 1991 with its headquarters in the former main fair building. However, today it is not actually a fair, but an exhibition center. Located in the historical centre of Old Kanavino.  Buildings  = The Main Fair building = The center of the fair was the main building in the spirit of classicism and the side administrative buildings that formed the central square. To protect from floods, a 3.5 m high dam was built. By the end of the 1880s, the Main Fair Building was very outdated and it was decided to completely rebuild it. The following year the construction of a new building was completed according to the project of the architects K. Treiman, A. von Gauguin and A. Trumbitsky. The building was built in the style of ancient Russian architecture of the 17th century. The building served as an administrative center. During the fair, it housed the governor's apartment, fair office, committee, branch of the state bank and others. On the first floor there was a beautiful passage in which there was a retail trade. On November 4, 2017, a new multimedia exhibition \\"Russia is My History\\" was opened in the Main Fair Building. The main focus of the exhibition is the history of Nizhny Novgorod, starting from Finno-Ugric peoples. On the territory of the complex there are departments in which they tell about the foundation of the city, the struggle for independence in the Time of Troubles and the bombing of the city during the World War II. On the first day of work, the entrance to the exhibition was free, because of which a long line lined up in front of the Main Fair Building. = Transfiguration Cathedral = Transfiguration Cathedral Also called Old-fair Cathedral. Temple in the style of late classicism. Until September 12, 2009 was the cathedral of the Nizhny Novgorod diocese. The height of the temple is 40 meters. The project of the cathedral was designed by Agust√≠n de Betancourt. To the construction of the building he attracted the architect Auguste de Montferrand - the creator of St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. The construction of the cathedral was begun in 1816. The iconostasis of the cathedral was painted by the Italian Torricelli according to the European canons, so many merchants refused to pray before the icons with naked bodies. Some people brought icons with them. The new iconostasis was created by the architect Vasily Stasov. It became known as an Old-fair cathedral after the construction of a new Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. The building of the cathedral was built behind the main fairground on the main axis of the fair plan. It stood on the mound and, over time, groundwaters and floods blurred the soil. The building began to draft and cracks appeared in the walls. At the end of the 19th century the cathedral was completely restored by the architect Robert Kilevain. After the October Revolution, the cathedral was closed. The warehouse was located in the temple, and in the administrative building - apartments. In April 1989, by the decision of the Council for Religious Affairs, the cathedral was transferred to the Gorky Diocese for restoration and use as a cathedral. Restoration work was started in the cathedral. At the same time, the church began to hold divine services on Saturdays and Sundays. September 11, 2009 Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus' Cyril took part in the opening of the monument to Nizhegorodians - participants in the liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The monument consists of a two-meter figure of an angel mounted on a three-meter pedestal. Around it are granite slabs with quotations from the Holy Scripture and the names of the dead. = Alexander Nevsky Cathedral = Alexander Nevsky Cathedral Also called New-fair Cathedral. Orthodox cathedral. Built in the years 1868-1881 on the project of the architect Lev Dahl. The abbot is Archpriest Sergey Matveyev since January 12, 2005. The height of the temple is 87 meters. In 1856 the merchants decided to build a new Orthodox cathedral in memory of the visit of the fair by Emperor Alexander II. They turned to the request for the construction of a new cathedral to Bishop Anthony and Governor A. Muraviov. A collection of donations was made. The required funds (454,667 rubles 28 kopecks) were recruited over 10 years (by 1866). September 15, 1867 was established by the construction committee for the construction of the temple, and August 11, 1868, was laying the cathedral on the Strelka (Spit). The main construction of the cathedral was begun on August 18, 1868 and lasted for 13 years. In the cathedral were transported icons from the liquidated Makaryev monastery, which suffered from a fire. In 1929, the temple was closed, valuables were seized. In the winter of 1930, according to the decision of the leadership of the Volga Flotilla, the iconostases and all the wooden ornaments of the cathedral were broken up for firewood to heat the city's houses. In the late 1920s, a project for the reconstruction of the fairground was developed. It was planned to dismantle the cathedral and build a lighthouse with a monument to Lenin in this place. This project was not carried out, but in the late 1930s, the tents on the roof of the cathedral were dismantled. During World War II, an anti- aircraft battery was installed on the site of the central tent of the cathedral, which defended the Gorky city (the name of Nizhny Novgorod in the Soviet era) from the Luftwaffe air raids. In 1983, the restoration of the cathedral began, during this period, voluntary restorers took an active part. In 1989, the restoration of the broken tents of the temple began. In February 1991, the Brotherhood of St. Alexander Nevsky was established. And in June 1992 the cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. On September 12, 2009, the cathedral was given the status of a cathedral (main).

In 1965, because the Pine River channel is near a congested area, the Coast Guard vacated the old U.S. Life-Saving Service Station (tearing down the shingled building), and relocated to the grounds of the old Lighthouse Supply Station. In 1989, the present steel and concrete pier replaced the old wooden pier with its concrete covering. The present piers and revetments were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s.

It is home to four Tar Heels athletic teams: women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, and wrestling. The arena opened in 1965 as Carmichael Auditorium and is named for William Donald Carmichael, Jr., a popular former school vice-president and brother of All- America basketball player Cartwright Carmichael. Although it was apparent by the early 1960s that the men's basketball team needed a new home to replace 27-year-old Woollen Gymnasium, the state refused to fund a completely new arena. As a result, Carmichael was built as an annex to Woollen; it shares the older facility's eastern wall. It originally seated just over 8,800 people, but was expanded to 10,000 seats in 1976. Carmichael was known as one of the loudest arenas in the country while the Tar Heel men played there, largely because of a low roof and a student section that ringed the court. During a 1982 game against the Virginia Cavaliers, it was so loud that the Virginia players could not even hear their own names being announced prior to the start of the game. In part due to this formidable home court advantage, the men had a record of 169‚Äì20 (.894) in just over 20 seasons there. Dean Smith was the Tar Heels' coach for their entire tenure in Carmichael. The Tar Heels won their second NCAA title in 1981-82, while playing at the arena. In their last game at Carmichael, the North Carolina Tar Heels beat the North Carolina State Wolfpack 90‚Äì79 on January 4, 1986. After a remodeling project completed in 2009, capacity is 8,010. Carmichael Auditorium, circa 1968 A new floor was installed in 1998, after a roof fire that occurred in February during renovations. The arena was completely remodeled beginning in spring 2008, and the women's team joined the men in the Dean Smith Center until completion in December 2009. The facility was officially renamed Carmichael Arena during the women's team's matchup against rival Duke on February 28, 2010. The men's team played their first round home game of the 2010 National Invitation Tournament at Carmichael because renovations were taking place at the Smith Center.

The different colors correspond to different compositions of glass. From left to right: Praseodymium doped, Erbium doped and non-doped ZBLAN glasses. ZBLAN is the most stable, and consequently the most used, fluoride glass, a subcategory of the heavy metal fluoride glass (HMFG) group. Typically its composition is 53% ZrF4, 20% BaF2, 4% LaF3, 3% AlF3 and 20% NaF. ZBLAN is not a single material but rather has a spectrum of compositions, many of which are still untried. The biggest library in the world of ZBLAN glass compositions is currently owned by Le Verre Fluore, the oldest company working on HMFG technology. Hafnium fluoride is chemically similar to zirconium fluoride, and is sometimes used in place of it. ZBLAN glass has a broad optical transmission window extending from 0.22 micrometers in the UV to 7 micrometers in the infrared. ZBLAN has low refractive index (about 1.5), a relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg) of 260‚Äì300 ¬∞C, low dispersion and a low and negative temperature dependence of refractive index dn/dT.  History  The first fluorozirconate glass was a serendipitous discovery in March 1974 by the Poulain brothers and their co-workers at the University of Rennes in France. While looking for new crystalline complex fluorides, they obtained unexpected pieces of glass. In a first step, these glasses were investigated for spectroscopic purposes. Glass formation was studied in the ZrF4-BaF2-NaF ternary system while the fluorescence of neodymium was characterized in quaternary ZrF4-BaF2-NaF-NdF3 bulk samples. The chemical composition of this original glass was very close to that of the classical ZBLAN, on the basis of a simple La/Nd substitution. Further experimental work led to major advances. First, ammonium bifluoride processing replaced the initial preparation method based on heat treatment of anhydrous fluorides in a metallic sealed tube. This process was already used by K. H. Sun, a pioneer of beryllium fluoride glasses. It offers significant advantages: preparation is implemented at room atmosphere in long platinum crucibles, zirconium oxide can be used as a starting material instead of pure ZrF4, synthesis time is reduced from 15 hours to less than one hour, and larger samples are obtained. One of the problems encountered was the devitrification tendency upon cooling the melt. The second breakthrough was the discovery of the stabilizing effect of aluminum fluoride in fluorozirconate glasses. The initial systems were fluorozirconates with ZrF4 as the primary constituent (>50 mol%), BaF2 main modifier (>30 mol%) and other metal fluorides LaF3, AlF3 added as tertiary constituents, to increase glass stability or improve other glass properties. Various pseudo-ternary systems were investigated at 4 mol% AlF3 leading to the definition of 7 stable glasses, such as ZBNA, ZBLA, ZBYA, ZBCA that could be cast as multi-kilogram bulk samples and resulted later in the classical ZBLAN glass composition that combines ZBNA and ZBLA. Further development on preparation method, scale-up, improvements of the manufacturing process, material stability and formulations was largely motivated by the experiments in French telecom at that time that found that intrinsic absorption for ZBLAN fibers was quite low (~10 dB/km) which could lead to an ultra-low optical loss solution in the mid-infrared. Such optical fibers could then become an excellent technical solution for a variety of systems for telecommunications, sensing and other applications.  Glass preparation  Fluoride glasses have to be processed in a very dry atmosphere in order to avoid oxyfluoride formation which will lead to glass-ceramic (crystallized glass) formation. The material is usually manufactured by the melting-quenching method. First the raw products are introduced in a platinum crucible, then melted, fined above 800 ¬∞C and cast in a metallic mold to ensure a high cooling rate (quenching), which favors glass formation. Finally they are annealed in a furnace to reduce the thermal stresses induced during the quenching phase. This process results in large transparent pieces of fluoride glass.  Material properties  =Optical= The most obvious feature of fluoride glasses is their extended transmission range. It covers a broad optical spectrum from the UV to the mid- infrared. The polarisability of fluorine anions is smaller than that of oxygen anions. For this reason, the refractive index of crystalline fluorides is generally low. This also applies to fluoride glasses: the index of ZBLAN glass is close to 1.5 while it exceeds 2 for zirconia ZrO2. Cationic polarisability must also be considered. The general trend is that it increases with atomic number. Thus in crystals, the refractive index of lithium fluoride LiF is 1.39 while it is 1.72 for lead fluoride PbF2. One exception concerns fluorozirconate glasses: hafnium is chemically very close to zirconium, but with a much larger atomic mass (178 g vs 91 g); but the refractive index of fluorohafnate glasses is smaller that that of fluorozirconates with the same molar composition. This is classically explained by the well known lanthanidic contraction that results from the filling of the f subshell and leads to a smaller ionic radius. Substituting zirconium by hafnium makes an easy way to adjust the numerical aperture of optical fibers. Optical dispersion expresses the variation of the refractive index with wavelength. It is expected to be low for glasses with a small refractive index. In the visible spectrum it is often quantified by the Abbe number. ZBLAN exhibits zero dispersion at about 1.72 ¬µm, compared with 1.5 ¬µm for silica glass. Refractive index changes with temperature because the polarisability of the chemical bonds increases with temperature, and because thermal expansion decreases the number of polarisable elements per unit volume. As a result dn/dT is positive for silica, while it is negative for fluoride glasses. At high power densities, refractive index follows the relation : :n = n0 \\\\+ n2I where n0 is the index observed at low power levels, n2 the nonlinear index and I the average electromagnetic field. Nonlinearity is smaller in low-index materials. In ZBLAN n2's value lies between 1 and 2√ó10-20 m2W-1. =Thermal= The glass transition temperature Tg is the major characteristic temperature of a glass. It corresponds to the transition between solid state and liquid state. At temperatures higher than Tg, glass is not rigid: its shape will change under external strain or even under its own weight. For ZBLAN, Tg ranges from 250 to 300 ¬∞C, depending on composition; mainly sodium content. Beyond Tg, molten glass becomes prone to devitrification. This transformation is commonly evidenced by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Two characteristic temperatures are measured from the DTA curve: Tx corresponds to the onset of crystallization and Tc is taken at the maximum of the exothermic peak. Glass scientists also use liquidus temperature TL. Beyond this temperature liquid does not produce any crystal and it may remain indefinitely in the liquid state. Thermal expansion data have been reported for a number of fluoride glasses, in the temperature range between ambient and Tg. In this range, as for most glasses, expansion is almost linearly dependent on temperature. =Mechanical=  Fiber optics  Thanks to their glassy state, ZBLAN can be drawn into optical fibers, using two glass compositions with different refractive indices to ensure guidance: the core glass and the cladding glass. It is critical to the quality of the manufactured fiber to ensure that during the fiber drawing process the drawing temperature and the humidity of the environment are highly controlled. In contrast to other glasses, the temperature dependence of ZBLAN's viscosity is very steep. ZBLAN fiber manufacturers have demonstrated significant increases in mechanical properties (>100 kpsi or 700 MPa for 125 ¬µm fiber) and attenuation as low as 3 dB/km at 2.6 ¬µm. ZBLAN optical fibers are used in different applications such as spectroscopy and sensing, laser power delivery and fiber lasers and amplifiers. = Comparison with alternative fiber technologies = Experimental attenuation curve of low-loss multimode silica and ZBLAN fiber Early silica optical fiber had attenuation coefficients on the order of 1000 dB/km, as reported in 1965.https://www.amazon.com/Fiber-Optic- Communication-Systems-Govind-Agrawal/dp/0470505117 Kapron at al reported in 1970 fibers having an attenuation coefficient of ~20 dB/km at 0.632 ¬µm, and Miya et al reported in 1979 ~0.2 dB/km attenuation at 1.550 ¬µm. Nowadays, silica optical fibers are routinely manufactured with an attenuation of <0.2 dB/km with Nagayama et al reporting in 2002 an attenuation coefficient as low as 0.151 dB/km at 1.568 ¬µm. The four order of magnitude reduction in the attenuation of silica optical fibers over four decades was the result of constant improvement of manufacturing processes, raw material purity, and improved preform and fiber designs, which allowed these fibers to approach the theoretical lower limit of attenuation. The advantages of ZBLAN over silica are: superior transmittance (especially in the UV and IR), higher bandwidth for signal transmission, spectral broadening (or supercontinuum generation) and low chromatic dispersion. Theoretical loss spectra (attenuation, dB/km) for a typical ZBLAN optical fiber (solid gray line) as function of wavelength (microns) The graph at right compares, as a function of wavelength, the theoretical predicted attenuation (dB/km) of silica (dashed blue line) with a typical ZBLAN formulation (solid gray line) as constructed from the dominant contributions: Rayleigh scattering (dashed gray line), infrared (IR) absorption (dashed black line) and UV absorption (dotted gray line). The difficulties that the community encountered when trying to use heavy metal fluoride glasses in the early years of development for a variety of applications were mostly related to the fragility of the fibers, a major drawback that prevented their broader adoption. However, the developers and manufacturers have dedicated significant effort in the last two decades to better understand the underlying causes of fiber fragility. The original fiber failure was primarily caused by surface defects, largely related to crystallization due to nucleation and growth, phenomena induced by factors such as raw material impurities and environmental conditions (humidity of the atmosphere during drawing, atmospheric pollutants such as vapors and dust, etc.) during processing. The particular focus on processing improvements has resulted in a 10√ó increase in the fiber strength. Compared to silica fiber, the intrinsic fiber strength of HMFG is currently only a factor of 2‚Äì3 lower. For example, the breaking radius of a standard 125 ¬µm single-mode fiber is < 1.5 mm for silica and < 4 mm for ZBLAN. The technology has evolved such that HMFG fibers can be jacketed to ensure that the bending radius of the cable will never reach the breaking point and thus comply with industrial requirements. The product catalogs usually call out a safe bending radius to ensure that end users handling the fiber stay within the safe margins. Contrary to current opinion fluoride glasses are very stable even in humid atmospheres and usually don‚Äôt require dry storage as long as water will remain in the vapor phase (i.e not being condensed on the fiber). Problems arise when the surface of the fiber comes in direct contact with liquid water (the polymeric coating usually applied to the fibers is permeable to water allowing water to diffuse through it). Current storage and transportation techniques require a very simple packaging strategy: the fiber spools are usually sealed with plastic together with a desiccant to avoid water condensation on the fiber. Studies of water attack on HMFG have shown that prolonged (> 1 hour) contact with water induces a drop in the pH of the solution which in turn increases the rate of the attack of water (the rate of attack of water increases with decreased pH). The leach rate of ZBLAN in water at pH = 8 is 10‚Äì5 g¬∑cm2/day with five orders of magnitude decrease between pH = 2 and pH = 8. The particular sensitivity of HMFG fibers such as ZBLAN to water is due to the chemical reaction between water molecules and the F‚àí anions which leads to the slow dissolution of the fibers. Silica fibers have a similar vulnerability to hydrofluoric acid, HF, which induces direct attack on the fibers leading to their breakup. Atmospheric moisture has a very limited effect on fluoride glasses in general, and fluoride glass/fibers can be used in a wide range of operating environments over extended periods of time without any material degradation.K. Fujiura, K. Hoshino, T. Kanamori, Y. Nishida, Y. Ohishi, S. Sudo, Technical Digest of Optical Amplifiers and Their Applications, Davos, Switzerland. 15‚Äì17 June 1995 (Optical Society of America, Washington DC, USA, 1995) ZBLAN produced with the same equipment in zero gravity (left) and in normal gravity (right) A large variety of multicomponent fluoride glasses have been fabricated but few can be drawn into optical fiber. The fiber fabrication is similar to any glass-fiber drawing technology. All methods involve fabrication from the melt, which creates inherent problems such as the formation of bubbles, core-clad interface irregularities, and small preform sizes. The process occurs at 310 ¬∞C in a controlled atmosphere (to minimize contamination by moisture or oxygen impurities which significantly weaken the fiber) using a narrow heat zone compared to silica. Drawing is complicated by a small difference (only 124 ¬∞C) between the glass transition temperature and the crystallization temperature. As a result, ZBLAN fibers often contain undesired crystallites. The concentration of crystallites was shown in 1998 to be reduced by making ZBLAN in zero gravity (see figure) which reduces convection processes.

The arena opened in 1972. It is currently home to the Missouri Tigers' wrestling and volleyball teams as well as the school's gymnastics and indoor track & field teams. It was home to the University of Missouri Tigers basketball team before Mizzou Arena opened in 2004. Groundbreaking for the Hearnes Center occurred in 1969, and the arena was officially dedicated on August 4, 1972. The arena got its name from former Missouri governor and 1952 Mizzou graduate Warren Hearnes. The cost of the building project was $10.75 million. Prior to the opening of the Hearnes Center, the Missouri basketball team played its home games at Brewer Fieldhouse, which was built in 1929 and has since been remodeled into a modern recreation center. Hearnes quickly became one of the toughest places to play during the 1980s, when players such as Steve Stipanovich, Jon Sundvold, Derrick Chievous and Doug Smith suited up for Norm Stewart. Several factors contributed to this reputation: the steep banking of the seating area, its flat roof and angling of its upper sections, and The Antlers, whose presence in Section A-16 made them the bane of many an opposition. Decibel meters were added to the corners of the arena in the early 1990s in addition to new scoreboards, and it was not uncommon to see them go well above 110 dB during conference games, and regularly cresting 125 dB against Kansas or during 2001's famed \\"Fire Code Game\\" against Iowa, where well over 14,500 people packed the building to see then-#2 Mizzou be stunned by Steve Alford's club. In its later life, the building saw several changes: a new floor was installed in 1998, rear-projection video monitors replaced the matrix boards at the turn of the new millennium, and the student seating plan was also altered. Before Quin Snyder came to coach the Tigers, student seating was scattered throughout the arena and distributed via who picked up tickets first, and while the largest amount sat along one sideline (including the band, Student Athletic Board and the aforementioned Antlers), others sat as high as the D sections, which early in the arena's life doubled as lecture halls (to this day, their seats have fold-out writing desks). Attempting to create an atmosphere similar to his former employers, Duke, Snyder mandated that all students be moved to one end of the court, where bleachers would replace the old seats and primacy would be given to his new \\"Zou Crew\\" club, with all other seating areas becoming general admission. The move was criticized for changing the atmosphere at Missouri games to something less distinctive while enabling more seats to be sold at a higher cost, but was duplicated (with more restrictions on student seating) at Mizzou Arena. The Hearnes Center also contains a field house that is home to the indoor track and field team, as well as one of the country's largest blood drives. Each fall, students donate blood as part of the school's Homecoming week festivities. In 2005, students and Columbia residents donated over 5,000 units of blood. 150pxDuring the school year, the parking lot adjacent to the main building serves as student parking for the many on-campus residents.

Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project, thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in taxes and royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit. Hollywood accounting gets its name from its prevalence in the entertainment industry‚Äîthat is, in the movie studios of Hollywood at a time when most studios were located in Hollywood. Those affected can include writers and actors, but also production companies, producers and investors. A number of cases of creative accounting have been successfully pursued in court and resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in awarded damages. Practices Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form, a subsidiary is formed to perform a given activity and the parent entity will extract money out of the film's revenue in the form of charges for certain \\"services\\". For example, a film studio has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which will then charge the studio a \\"distribution fee\\" ‚Äî essentially, the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and hence control the profitability report of a project. Another form of Hollywood accounting is a reverse Tobashi scheme, in which the studio unjustly cross-collateralizes the accounting of two projects and shifts losses from a flop onto a profitable project by shifting costs involving internal operations. This way, two unprofitable projects are created out of one on paper alone, primarily for the purpose of eliminating net participation liabilities. The specific schemes can range from the simple and obvious to the extremely complex. Generally, Hollywood accounting utilizes permanent creative accounting practices (such as charging an arbitrary distribution fee from one sub-entity to another) rather than temporary ones (like the Repo 105 scheme) since the measures are meant to permanently distort the bottom line of a film project. Three main factors in Hollywood accounting reduce the reported profit of a movie, and all have to do with the calculation of overhead: * Production overhead: Studios, on average, calculate production overhead by using a figure around 15% of total production costs. * Distribution overhead: Film distributors typically keep 30% of what they receive from movie theaters (\\"gross rentals\\"). * Marketing overhead: To determine this number, studios usually choose about 10% of all advertising costs. All of the above means of calculating overhead are highly controversial, even within the accounting profession. Namely, these percentages are assigned without much regard to how, in reality, these estimates relate to actual overhead costs. In short, this method does not, by any rational standard, attempt to adequately trace overhead costs. Because of the studio's ability to place arbitrary charges along the Value chain, net participation \\"points\\" (a percentage of the net income as opposed to a percentage of the gross income of a film) are sometimes referred to as \\"monkey points\\". The term is attributed to Eddie Murphy, who is said to have also stated that only a fool would accept net points in their contract. > \\"By the way, you called net profit participation points yesterday 'monkey > points.' What's the origin of that, do you know?\\" I asked Eddie [Murphy] as > I started to pick up my papers. \\"Well, it's like 'stupid' points. Stupid to > take the points.\\" \\"Won't be any net profits?\\" \\"You sit there with your > points going, 'Eeeh, eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh'.\\" Actress Lynda Carter on The Late Show with Joan Rivers commented \\"Don't ever settle for net profits. It's called 'creative accounting'.\\"The Late Show with Joan Rivers. Fox Network. Air date: February 9, 1987 Many insist on \\"gross points\\" (a percentage of some definition of gross revenue) rather than net profit participation. This practice reduces the likelihood of a project showing a profit, as a production company will claim a portion of the reported box-office revenue was diverted directly to gross point participants. However, gross participation is a rare bargaining chip allowed by the studios and hence hard to obtain unless the person has considerable leverage in the deal - such as an A-list star, director or producer who is vital for a project. Examples According to Lucasfilm, Return of the Jedi, despite having earned $475 million at the box office against a budget of $32.5 million, \\"has never gone into profit\\". Art Buchwald received a settlement from Paramount after his lawsuit Buchwald v. Paramount. The court found Paramount's actions \\"unconscionable\\", noting that it was impossible to believe that Eddie Murphy's 1988 comedy Coming to America, which grossed $288 million, failed to make a profit, especially since the actual production costs were less than a tenth of that. Paramount settled for $900,000,(http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-17/local/me-3895_1_net-profit Buchwald, Partner Win $900,000 From Studio) rather than have its accounting methods closely scrutinized. Producers Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker filed a breach of contract lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be \\"the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of the 1989 film Batman and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of Batman.\\" A superior court judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of Batman have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have \\"not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless.\\" Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker's attorney as \\"two popcorns and two Cokes\\".Olly Richards (September 1992). \\"Trouble in Gotham\\", Empire, pp. 21-23.

The case was settled in 1999, with Garrison's estate receiving a \\"very small settlement.\\" Winston Groom's price for the screenplay rights to his novel Forrest Gump included a 3% share of the profits; however, due to Hollywood accounting, the film's commercial success was converted into a net loss, and Groom received only $350,000 for the rights and an additional $250,000 from the studio. Screenwriter Ed Solomon says that Sony claims Men in Black has never broken even, despite grossing nearly $600 million against a $90 million budget. Gone in 60 Seconds grossed $240 million at the box office, but the studio declared a $212 million loss, primarily through Hollywood accounting as explained on NPR. The real figure is likely closer to $90 million. Stan Lee, co-creator of the character Spider-Man, had a contract awarding him 10% of the net profits of anything based on his characters. The film Spider-Man (2002) made more than $800 million in revenue, but the producers claim that it did not make any profit as defined in Lee's contract, and Lee received nothing. In 2002 he filed a lawsuit against Marvel Comics. The case was settled in January 2005, with Marvel paying $10 million to \\"finance past and future payments claimed by Mr. Lee.\\" The 2002 film My Big Fat Greek Wedding was considered hugely successful for an independent film, yet according to the studio, the film lost money. Accordingly, the cast (with the exception of Nia Vardalos who had a separate deal) sued the studio for their part of the profits. The original producers of the film have sued Gold Circle Films due to Hollywood accounting practices because the studio has claimed the film, which cost less than $6 million to make and made over $350 million at the box office, lost $20 million. Peter Jackson, director of The Lord of the Rings, and his studio Wingnut Films, brought a lawsuit against New Line Cinema after an audit. Jackson stated this is regarding \\"certain accounting practices\\". In response, New Line stated that their rights to a film of The Hobbit were time-limited, and since Jackson would not work with them again until the suit was settled, he would not be asked to direct The Hobbit, as had been anticipated. Fifteen actors are suing New Line Cinema, claiming that they have never received their 5% of revenue from merchandise sold in relation to the movie, which contains their likenesses. Similarly, the Tolkien estate sued New Line, claiming that their contract entitled them to 7.5% of the gross receipts of the $6 billion hit.The Associated Press: Tolkien Estate Sues New Line Cinema, February 12, 2008. According to New Line's accounts, the trilogy made \\"horrendous losses\\" and no profit at all. Michael Moore sued Bob and Harvey Weinstein in February 2011, claiming that they had used creative accounting to deprive him of his share of profits for the film Fahrenheit 9/11.

In the same year, Rearden Steel was started by Steve Perlman, founder of WebTV, under a veil of secrecy. In 2000, Rearden Steel was renamed to Moxi Digital while at the same time unveiling a line of media centers designed to bridge the gap between PCs and TVs.CNET: Rearden Steel unveils multimedia system Digeo, Inc. purchased Moxi Digital in 2002.New York Times: TECHNOLOGY; Interactive TV Deal Unites Moxi Digital With Digeo Digeo kept its own name but adopted the 'Moxi' name as its product family name. Most of Moxi Digital's staff were kept as well as its Palo Alto offices. Digeo also adopted most of the Moxi hardware, (originally focused on satellite consumer electronics) as well as some of the Linux extensions. These were merged into Digeo's own Linux-based infrastructure and cable-specific hardware, with Digeo's prized and Emmy award-winning user interface, now known as Moxi Menu, on top. On September 22, 2009, the assets of Digeo, Inc. were purchased by Arris Group, a communications technology company specializing in the design and engineering of broadband networks. Arris is a developer, manufacturer and supplier of cable telephony, video and high-speed data equipment, as well as outside plant construction and maintenance equipment for cable system operators. Arris announced they would continue to develop and market the Moxi product line to both retail customers and cable operators.ARRIS Purchases Digeo, Inc. in Cash Transaction Retail DVR products The Moxi HD DVR is a high-definition DVR with both 3-tuner and 2-tuner models available, although the 2-tuner model was produced only briefly before being updated. It was designed for use with cable television and supports multi-stream CableCARDs as well as channel scanning for unencrypted channels. Multi-room viewing is supported using a small (and less expensive) companion device called a Moxi Mate. The Moxi product line was released to retail in December 2008 Engadget HD: 500GB Moxi HD DVR now available, really after many years of being available only to cable operators. From 2009, Arris offered multi-room packages. Retail sales were suspended early in 2012. = DVR hardware = The Moxi HD DVR is a Broadcom BCM7400-based set top box designed to work with a Multi-stream CableCARD. Moxi features were added to the Arris Moxi Gateway and Moxi Player, for sale to cable companies only. The hardware featured: * Two or three HD tuners, allowing users to record two or three shows at the same time, depending on the model * 500 GB storage, which equates to 75 hours of 1080 HD recording or 300 hours of SD (480i) recording * Dolby Digital surround sound The Moxi HD DVR is compatible with eSATA external hard drives certified for DVR use. External drives allow users to extend their hard drive space. Currently, drives up to 6.5TB are supported. Moxi HD DVRs support 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, and 1080p 24 and 30 Hz TV resolutions. Automatic resolution switching passes through the native resolution of source programming, which helps to preserve picture quality. Moxi products also support down-conversion to standard definition. Cross-conversion between HD signals (720p and 1080i) are very good. However, up-conversion from SD to HD introduces significant video artifacts, and 480p output produces a very soft picture. It is recommended that 480p not be used, and that any up-conversions are done by the display hardware rather than the Moxi. = Moxi Mate hardware = The Moxi Mate is the multi-room extender for the Moxi HD DVR released in August 2009.Engadget HD: The Moxi Summer update brings the Moxi Mate, SDV support and more It is a small, silent set-top box that connects with the Moxi HD DVR over the home network, so users can browse and play live TV as well as recorded programs in other rooms. The Moxi Mate can also play media files available from the home network or the Internet using the same interface as the HD DVR. The Moxi Mate previously retailed for $299 but is no longer available for sale. Moxi features have been added to the Arris Moxi Gateway and Moxi Player, components of the ARRIS Whole Home Solution which is not a retail product (for sale to cable companies only) = Moxi Menu = The Moxi DVR features a user interface called the Moxi Menu. The Moxi Menu is presented fully in HD. It has a horizontal band that makes up the top level of menu choices. As users select a category on the horizontal band, choices within that category expand in a vertical list. When the user selects an item such as a channel or a piece of media, a popup menu gives them choices for that media, such as watch or record. The available choices vary depending on the type of item that is being accessed. If the user holds down an arrow button on the remote while navigating the menu, the menu scrolls by more quickly. A TV window in the upper right corner continues playing content while the menu is accessed. The Moxi Menu includes two weeks of television programming information. There are a few ways to access live TV channels and television guide data. One is a more traditional Channels menu that allows viewing shows by channel. Moxi also provides an assortment of category menus that only contain certain types of TV shows, such as HDTV, Movies, Sports, Kids, News, and Music. Also, a Favorites category automatically populates with the channels watched most frequently. By default, users can view program titles for multiple TV channels simultaneously, but, except for the currently selected or displayed channel, only for one time slot at a time. For the currently selected or displayed channel, the next three shows and their times are displayed in a paddle off to the right side of the vertical list. To see more time slots, users can use the BACK and NEXT buttons on the remote to scroll through time slots (this works on all menus) or can double press the askew 'square' button on the top row of the remote to view a more traditional TV channel grid guide (this only works for the Channels menu). While watching full-screen TV (with the Moxi Menu hidden), the Moxi Flip Bar (a bar that pops up on the bottom of the screen) provides programming information and ability to change channels by using the arrow keys on the remote. Moxi can perform the following searches for TV programs: title, keyword, and category. Shows that broadcast in HD are recorded in HD as well. The DVR provides automatic conflict resolution when too many shows are scheduled to record. Users can choose to record single episodes or entire series, single timeslots or first run shows only. Recordings can be extended at the beginning or end of the scheduled timeslot. Recorded shows are accessed through a horizontal category called Recorded TV, where users can watch, delete, or protect their shows. Moxi Menu provides access to parental controls through the settings category. Users can lock shows by TV, movie rating or channel. On Demand and Pay-Per- View purchase options can also be restricted. = MediaLink = Moxi's Media Link application uses DLNA-compliant servers on your computer to stream music, photos, and videos to your TV.Engadget HD: Moxi's spring updates brings PlayOn, DLNA and a little home automation Any DLNA server will work with the Moxi HD DVR, but TwonkyMedia Manager, Tversity Media Server, Windows Media Connect, and PlayOn are fully tested. PlayOn also provides the ability to access user's Hulu and Netflix accounts, as well as particular YouTube videos. = Games = A variety of single and two player games can be played with the remote. They range from casino favorites to arcade classics to intuitive family games. They have been optimized for the Moxi remote control, and are designed to be played with the arrow keys and OK buttons. Game titles include: Solitaire, Battleship, Checkers, Video Poker, Blackjack, Bijoux, Blast It, Tomato, Invasion Wave and Bowling. The Moxi-exclusive Tomato game allows you to throw a virtual tomato and watch it splat on anything that appears on your TV screen. = Moxi.com and Remote Scheduling = The Moxi HD DVR uses an online service called Moxi.com to receive its television guide data and other online services. On first setting up a Moxi, the user is required to register the device at Moxi.com to configure television guide settings and other online services. Moxi.com also provides a central location for users to manage their Moxi devices and features. Using Moxi.com, users can access TV listings via the internet and remotely schedule TV recordings. Users can also review the list of recordings on their home DVR and see a list of previously scheduled and upcoming recordings. The online scheduling service supports realtime conflict resolution; so if a new recording is scheduled from the web that conflicts with an existing recording, the user will be given the same resolution options they would receive if they were interacting with the DVR directly. = SuperTicker = One of the more innovative interactive TV widgets, the Moxi SuperTicker, provides one-touch access to weather, sports scores, news, and other information. It appears as an info crawl at the bottom of TV, with the actual TV video scaled down so that no actual video content is obscured. Unlike bound tickers, Moxi's SuperTicker(TM) stays on the screen when you change channels. Customers can use the arrow buttons on the remote to navigate through SuperTicker(TM) content and lock on a specific topic, such as a current football game. A customer can also display the full text of any displayed headline. = Flickr, Rhapsody, and FineTune = The Moxi HD DVR supports the free online photo-sharing service Flickr. Because of this, users can post pictures on Flickr and then view those photos on their Moxi HD DVR by adding their Flickr account through Moxi.com. Multiple Flickr accounts or members can be added, so it is possible to browse publicly shared pictures from many people's accounts quickly and seamlessly. The Moxi also allows users to choose the format pictures will be viewed in; with current options being a slideshow or a mosaic. The online music services Rhapsody and Finetune are also supported by the Moxi. Finetune is presented in a walled-garden style web browser while Rhapsody is fully integrated into the Moxi Menu. A single Rhapsody account can be registered on a user's Moxi.com account and this will allow use of the Rhapsody features on all devices on that account. Rhapsody featured music, playlists, and channels can be listed; among other things. A search interface is also provided. = MoxiNet = The MoxiNet feature provides both a walled garden experience with content designed for the television and the ability to bookmark particular Web sites for display on the TV.  Cable DVR products  Moxi Cable HD DVRs have been available for several years and have been used by cable operators long before the retail product line was released. = Hardware and feature availability = There are multiple models of Moxi Cable HD DVRs currently in the marketplace. Moxi's cable offering involves a software platform and management and distribution portal that can be ported to a range of hardware devices. This software platform includes the range of Moxi functions and features, as well as the flexibility for MSOs to offer different subsets for individual markets. =On Demand and Pay-Per-View= Moxi cable's interface allows you to browse, preview and purchase On Demand programming. Users can surf through On Demand titles in a designated menu category, or find On Demand titles included within the search and browse results alongside Pay-Per-View (PPV), live TV and recorded show listings. Parental Controls can be applied to On Demand and Pay- Per-View the same way they are applied to regular channels. =Photos= The Cable DVR photo features differ from retail. Cable DVRs features one-touch import of photos from memory cards, which stores photos on the media center hard disk drive. Photo albums can also be imported from a digital camera via the USB port. Once imported, users are able to view the photo albums in a full screen slideshow. It supports most memory card formats, including CompactFlash-I, CompactFlash-II, Smart Memory, Memory Stick, MicroDrive, Multimediacard and Secure Digital Card. =PC Link= Instead of MediaLink, the cable DVR features PC Link, which uses the Windows Media Connect application on a PC to stream music and photos to the Moxi Cable HD DVR. Files appear alongside locally stored media, and have an icon that distinguishes them. =Jukebox= The cable Moxi Jukebox allows users to copy music from CDs to the hard drive so that the CD can be taken elsewhere. Music is organized into genre, artist, or album view.  Awards  =Emmy Awards= 2005 Advanced Media Technology Emmy The Moxi Media Center was recognized for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for the Creation of Non- Traditional Programs or Platforms. 2004 Best TV User Interface Digeo, Inc. was awarded an Advanced Media Technology Emmy for its innovative Moxi Media Center User Interface, called the Moxi Menu. The Moxi Menu's dual-axis navigation puts content choices on the menu's top level, minimizing the number of clicks a user needs to go through. In addition, the Mini-TV window allows viewers to watch programming while surfing through the menu.

He held minor office in the Conservative administration of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin in the 1920s and was later Lord Steward of the Household from 1935 to 1936. He was also a noted patron of the British film industry with the Sutherland Trophy named in his honour. Background Sutherland was the eldest son of Cromartie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 4th Duke of Sutherland, by Lady Millicent St Clair-Erskine, daughter of Robert St Clair-Erskine, 4th Earl of Rosslyn. He was born at Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire, in 1888 and was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and Eton College. Military and naval service Sutherland served in the regular army as a lieutenant in the Royal Scots Greys from 1909 to 1910, and later in the Territorial Force as a captain in the 5th battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders from 1910 to 1912. From 1914, he was Honorary Colonel of the same battalion. He later took a commission in the Royal Naval Reserve, with which he served in the First World War, rising to the rank of commander. In 1914, he commanded and served on the British Military Mission to Belgium in 1914‚Äì1915. From 1915 to 1917, he commanded the Motor Flotilla sailing between Egypt and the Adriatic Sea. He was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy. Political career Sutherland succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1913 and took his seat in the House of Lords. The same year he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Sutherland (succeeding his father), a position he retained until 1944. He was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1921 and then served in the Conservative governments of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin as Under-Secretary of State for Air from 1922 to 1924, as Paymaster-General from 1925 to 1928, and as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1928 to 1929. He was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1929. In 1936, he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Steward of the Household, a post he held until 1937. In the latter year he bore the orb at the coronation of King George VI. Sutherland was the first Chairman of the British Film Institute, from 1933 to 1936, and remained its patron until his death. From 1958, the BFI awarded the Sutherland Trophy, named after him, to \\"the maker of the most original and imaginative film introduced at the National Film Theatre during the year\\".1963 London Film Festival Programme, London: BFI Family Sutherland married Lady Eileen Gwladys Butler, daughter of Charles Butler, 7th Earl of Lanesborough on 11 April 1912. After her death in 1943, he married Clare Josephine O'Brian (1903-1998) on 1 July 1944. Sutherland died in 1963, aged 74 and without issue. His titles were divided according to their patents: the Earldom of Sutherland and Lordship of Strathnaver passed to his niece, Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland, only daughter of Lord Alastair Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, while the remainder of his titles passed to the heir male, a distant relative, the Earl of Ellesmere.

It is adjacent to the Avon Park Lakes Subdivision, north of the city of Avon Park. The slope of the lake drops quickly from the shoreline to a depth of about . This lake has no public access, as it is entirely surrounded by private property. On the northeast side is the now vacant Walker Memorial Hospital. On the southwest side is the local Seventh-day Adventist Church. History On the northeast shore the Highlands Lake Hotel was built in the 1920s. It featured the hotel, a casino and an 18-hole golf course. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced the hotel out of business. A purchaser in 1936 planned to convert the property into a health resort, but nothing materialized, as the scheme was said to be fraudulent. In World War II the US government purchased the hotel and converted it into the Lodwick Aviation Military Academy. The Academy included a barracks built to the north of the old hotel. The barracks housed cadets training to be Army Air Corps pilots. The Academy closed at the end of the war and in 1946 plans were begun to transform the old hotel into a hospital. The Seventh-Day Adventist Church was to own and operate the hospital. Charles Walker was the president of the organization instrumental in the effort. He died of a heart attack before the hospital could be opened in 1948. The hospital opened as Walker Memorial Sanitarium and Hospital, in honor of Charles Walker. The name was shortened later to Walker Memorial Hospital. The hospital prospered and grew over the years. Satellite facilities were added in Lake Placid in 1982 and in Wauchula in 1992. The building was extensively remodelled, but the demands of the community overwhelmed the facility. As a result, the Adventists built Florida Hospital Heartland Medical Center in Sebring, which opened in 1997. The old Walker Hospital remained vacant, although at least two remodelling projects were considered. In 2004 the building was severely damaged by the triple blows of Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne. Another hurricane passed over the area in 2005. In 2007, the old Walker Memorial Hospital was demolished, so the lakeside property could be used for a new commercial development. The new project was abandoned, because of poor economic conditions.

He was until January 2012, head coach at Newcastle Falcons and a former rugby union and professional rugby league footballer. He played outside centre for Scotland (RU), and the British and Irish Lions. He played club rugby union for Kelso, and the Newcastle Falcons, and club rugby league for Widnes and Leeds. Tait changed codes twice in his life, once going from rugby union to rugby league, and then going the other way after union became professional during the mid-1990s. Rugby Union Unlike many other cross-code converts of the period, Tait had the benefit of growing up in Cumbria, where his father, Alan Senior, was playing for Workington Town. However, Tait played Union first and made his Test d√©but for Scotland in the inaugural 1987 World Cup held in New Zealand where, he came on after seven minutes as a replacement in a 20‚Äì20 draw with France in Christchurch. Rugby League The following year Tait switched codes to rugby league where he was to spend the next eight years playing club rugby for Widnes and Leeds, as well as representing Great Britain and Scotland. During the 1989‚Äì90 season, he played for defending champions Widnes at fullback in their 1989 World Club Challenge victory against the visiting Canberra Raiders. Tait won the Harry Sunderland Trophy in both 1989 and 1990. Alan Tait played in Widnes' 24‚Äì18 victory over Salford in the 1990 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1990‚Äì91 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 September 1990. Alan Tait played in Widnes' 6-12 defeat by Wigan in the 1988‚Äì89 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1988‚Äì89 season at Burnden Park, Bolton on Saturday 7 January 1989, and played , and scored a try in the 24-0 victory over Leeds in the 1991‚Äì92 Regal Trophy Final during the 1991‚Äì92 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 January 1992. In the 1992 World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium Tait was selected to play for Great Britain from the reserve bench in their defeat by Australia. He also made appearances in the Challenge Cup Finals in 1994 and 1995 Return to Union With the advent of Rugby Union turning profession Tait along with many other converts switched codes back to union in 1996 signing for the Newcastle Falcons with whom he won the Premiership in 1998, making 19 appearances that season. At first he was ignored by the Scotland selectors but eventually made his return for Scotland after a nine-year absence in 1997 and went on to represent the British & Irish Lions in South Africa also in the summer of that year. Surprising many Tait was selected to start the first two Tests on the wing, even though his favoured and more recognised position was at centre. This was due to coach Ian McGeechan believing that Tait would add extra defensive capabilities to the backline over the other wingers, in what would be a tight test series. He famously scored a try in the first match as the Lions won 25‚Äì16 in Cape Town. He also played in the second match which saw the Lions clinch the series after a dramatic 18‚Äì15 victory in Durban. Injured before the 3rd Test he did not play as the Lions lost the last match 35‚Äì16. For Scotland Tait developed a devastating partnership with John Leslie. Many saw their pairing as instrumental in Scotland's good performances of the time and allowing stand- off Gregor Townsend to exploit gaps in the opposition defence. This was no more apparent that in the 1999 Five Nations Championship where Townsend would become the fifth and last player in history to score a try against each of the other countries in the five nations tournament. The championship culminated in Scotland narrowly finished ahead of England on points difference thanks to Wales' last minute victory over England at Wembley. Tait scored two tries in Scotland's last match of the tournament as they put in an historic performance to beat France 36‚Äì22. Later that year he represented Scotland for the last time at the 1999 World Cup finishing with a defeat by the All Blacks. He scored a try against South Africa in the pool stages at Murrayfield in a 46‚Äì29 reverse to the holders. In 2000 Tait retired from professional rugby finishing his last game playing for his last club Edinburgh Reivers. In all Tait played 27 times, scoring 17 tries, for Scotland, this is an exceptional record especially when considering that the bulk of these games were played after his return from League at the age of 32. Partly because of this it is why Tait is still regarded in high esteem by Scotland supporters to this day. Coaching Following his retirement from playing he then moved into coaching, initially working with Scotland as a defence coach. Although he was dismissed from the post by Matt Williams he was later restored to that role by Williams successor Frank Hadden. In 2004 he joined the Borders as a defensive coach. Tait then moved back to the Falcons as an assistant before assuming the top job at the Premiership club as part of a restructuring process in the wake of Steve Bates' departure from the post of director of rugby in 2009. He held the position of Head Coach of Newcastle from 2009 to 2012 until club owner, Semore Kurdi announced Tait was 'taking a break from rugby' following a series of poor results. Family Tait has a son, Michael, who was also a professional rugby union player. Michael appeared for the Scotland national under-20 rugby union team in 2010 and signed for Edinburgh in 2014 before retiring later the same year due to injury.

Changes in price indices trigger changes in prices of goods. Contracts are made to accommodate the price-changing scenario by means of indexation. Indexation in a high-inflation economy is evident when, for instance, a given price must be recalculated later to incorporate inflation accumulated over the period to \\"correct\\" the price. In other cases, local currency prices can be expressed in terms of a foreign currency. At some point in the future, prices are converted back from the foreign currency equivalent into local currency. The conversion from a \\"stronger\\" currency equivalent value, the foreign currency, is intended to protect the real value of goods, as the nominal value depreciates. In the medium and long terms, economic agents begin to forecast inflation and to use those forecasts as de facto price indexes that can trigger price adjustments before the actual price indices are made known to the public. That cycle of forecast-price adjustment-forecast closes itself in the form of a feedback loop, and inflation indices get beyond control since current inflation becomes the basis for future inflation (more formally, economic agents start to adjust prices solely based on their expectations of future inflation). At worst, inflation tends to grow exponentially and lead to hyperinflation.

It is also referred to as \\"failure of basis\\". (2016) 28 Bond Law Review 21. It is an 'unjust factor' for the purposes of the law of unjust enrichment. Where there is a \\"total failure of consideration\\" the claimant can seek restitution of the benefit by bringing an action in unjust enrichment against the defendant. Historically speaking, this was as a quasi-contractual claim known as an action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use for a consideration that wholly failed. The orthodox view is that it is necessary for any relevant contract to be ineffective, for example because it is discharged for breach, void ab initio (from the beginning) or frustrated. However, it will be available on a subsisting contract where it does not undermine the contractual allocation of risk.. Failure of consideration is a highly technical area of law. Particular areas of controversy include: *Whether the failure of the consideration must be 'total', (2006) 33(1) University of Western Australia Law Review 132. and the scope and meaning of such a requirement; *Whether 'consideration' refers not only to bargained-for counter-performance by the defendant, but also a legal or factual state of affairs; *Whether this ground of restitution only applies to money claims or also extends to non-money benefits (e.g., chattels, services); *Whether this ground of restitution can be relied upon by a contract-breaker; *Whether the (now ineffective) contract has any impact upon (a) the availability of a claim; or (b) the valuation of any such claim; *Whether a failure of consideration can also generate proprietary remedies (e.g., a resulting trust); *Whether a claimant can elect to terminate a contract for breach and escape a 'bad bargain' by suing in unjust enrichment on the ground of total failure of consideration.

History =Origins= Originally known as the Office for Strengthening of Unity Between Universities and Theological Seminaries, (Daftar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat-e Hozeh va Daneshgah), according to Iranfocus.com, the OSU was set up by Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, at a time when Beheshti was Iranian Supreme Ruler Ruhallah Khomeini‚Äôs top confidant and a key figure in the clerical leadership. Beheshti wanted the OSU to organise Islamist students to counter the influence of the opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq (MeK) among university students. The OSU played a central role in the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran in November 1979. Members of the OSU central council, who included Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as well as Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Kadivar, Mohsen Aghajari, and Abbas Abdi, were regularly received by the Ayatollah Khomeini himself. (One of the first political offices held by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was as representative of students at his university, Elm-o Sanaat, at the OSU in 1979.) During the crackdown on universities in 1980, which Khomeini called the Islamic Cultural Revolution, Ahmadinejad and the OSU played a critical role in purging dissident lecturers and students many of whom were arrested and later executed. =Reformism= Sometime around or before the 1997 election of reformist President Mohammad Khatami the group changed its orientation. The OSU was the most important supporter of reformist President Mohammad Khatami in his first term. However they became critical of Khatami as it became clear he was not able to promote democracy in Iran. In 2001, Ali Afshari, one of the leaders of OSU, was sentenced to five years in jail: four years \\"for acting against national security by participating in the Berlin Conference, six months for establishing a crisis centre\\" in the OSU, and \\"six months for disseminating propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\" He and Akbar Atri gave a controversial lecture in a lecture hall in US congress in 2006. In 2002 the OSU was \\"divided into two wings\\" over the question of whether to boycott the presidential election. \\"The majority 'Allameh' faction\\" wanted \\"to withdraw from the political system\\" and boycott the election, whereas the minority \\"pro-conservative\\" 'Shiraz' faction\\" generally favored participation and \\"operating within the current political framework.\\" The directors of the office are annually selected democratically from Iranian University students all over the country.

Its headquarters is located in Santa Clara, California.  KRU or Kru Interactive The South Korea-based game company made a name for itself in the early 1990s. Kru launched Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds in 1997, Dark Ages in 1999. Shattered Galaxy, the award winning and first massive online RTS game, was introduced in 2001. The company has recently expanded into other Asian countries, notably Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore; along with the United States. For a short time, Shattered Galaxy was sold in stores in the United States but never sold well because it was offered for free in a long-term open beta and then made available as a pay for play, only four months after commercial launch, from the Shattered Galaxy website. Shattered Galaxy has also been awarded the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Audience Choice Awards, Technical Excellence Award, and Best Game Design at the 2001 Independent Games Festival Awards. Nexon has also released a few unsuccessful games to the North American audience in beta form which have since been dropped. They include Elemental Saga, QuizQuiz and Elancia. QuizQuiz never left beta stage in North America but was later released through the Singapore division of Nexon, NexonAsia in an English version. QuizQuiz has since evolved into the exclusively Korean and Japanese online game Q-Play, while Elemental Saga was eventually cancelled. NEXON has several games exclusively available to Korean players such as Elancia and Crazy Arcade..
