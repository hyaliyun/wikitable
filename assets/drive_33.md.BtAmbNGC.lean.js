Probably built in first quarter of the 19th century, it was long been associated with the nearby ferry service to Plattsburgh, New York, and is one of the town's few surviving 19th-century stone buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Gordon-Center House stands on the east side of West Shore Road, north of the Gordon's Landing ferry terminus and just south of the Ed Weed Cultural Fish Station. It is a 2-1/2 story stone structure, built out of ashlar granite and coursed rubble, with a side-gable slate roof and two interior chimneys. The entrance is centered on the main facade, and features a distinctive oversized keystone arch. A 2-1/2 story wood-frame wing, dating to early in the building's history, extends to the left. The property also includes five barns, all built before 1930, reflective of the evolutionary changes in the property's agricultural uses. Apparently completed in 1824, the interior has retained a few Federal style details despite fairly extensive alterations early in the 20th century. The building was long been associated with the ferry service operated, and tradition has it that its construction was begun by Hazen Bell and completed by someone named Boardman. Both were known to be operators of the ferry service, and its subsequent owners were also ferry owners and operators until 1941. The Gordon and Center families were later owners of both the house and ferry privilege in the 19th century.

Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia tuberculata is classified in subgenus Vermilacinia in which it is distinguished by its much-branched thallus to 5 cm tall with a rough cortex due to tiny tubercles that resemble isidia (isidium); the branches are 1‚Äì5 mm wide and sometimes bear subterminal apothecia.

Evidently the authors in the original publication may have confused (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane with zeorin. A correction by Spjut was noted on World botanical Associates web page.World Botanical Associates, Niebla and Vermilacinia from Baja California, retrieved 1 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichens.htm In 2004, Bowler and Marsh retained the species in Niebla, while also indicating that secondary metabolites were usnic acid and unidentified triterpenes. The triterpene zeorin is frequently absent or in trace amounts in a number of species in the subgenus Vermilacinia, whereas (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane is found in all species taking into the correction.

understand humans and our place in nature. Originally from Chile, she is a primatologist, a pioneer adventurer-scientist and the first South American in following great apes in the wild. Education Behncke has a BSc in Zoology and an MSc in Wildlife Conservation from University College London, an MPhil in Human Evolution from Cambridge and a DPhil in Evolutionary Anthropology from Oxford. Career She walked more than 3,000 km following wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the Congo jungle. Her PhD for Oxford University was the first comprehensive study of play behaviour in wild bonobos known to science. Behncke applies an evolutionary lens to derive insights into human behaviour and the modern challenges that humanity and the planet face. Her focus in studying play in non-human primates has been to shed light on the role of play in our own development, as humans are one of the few species that play during adulthood. For Dr Behncke, play is at the root of creativity, social bonding and healthy development. she is an Academic Collaborator of the Research Centre in Social Complexity (CICS) in Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; a Fellow of the Bay Area-based Gruter Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Human Behavior & Institutions; and Visiting Researcher at Robin Dunbar's Social Neuroscience Evolutionary Research Group (SNRG) at University of Oxford. =Conservation of Temperate Rainforests= As Director of Huilo-Huilo Foundation, she was part of the emerging private conservation movement of the early 2000s. At 60,000 square km, Huilo-Huilo is a private for profit natural reserve and ecotourism project in southern Chile. For this work, she lived in the field (years 2001-2004), near the shores of Northern Patagonia's Pirihueico Lake with her parrot Tuk. With the aim of enhancing ecosystem resilience Behncke was part of a group of people who were pioneering social and ecosystem integration through the creation of biodiversity corridors and habitat conservation. She worked with organizations such as Senda Darwin and Parques para Chile, and international wilderness conservation Planet Heritage Foundation. = Wild bonobo research = Bonobos, together with chimpanzees, are our living closest relatives. Yet they are the least known of apes. They are highly endangered and live only south of the river Congo in the tropical jungles of DRC. Bonobos are unusual in that they are highly sexual, peaceful, and have a matriarchy where non-related females bond strongly with each other. They, like humans, play throughout their lives. It appears that the regular experience of social fun is core to developing and maintaining bonobo cohesive societies. Isabel has highlighted the importance of the role of females in animal societies not just in bonobos but also in other species such as elephants Isabel worked at Wamba, Luo Reserve, the world's longest running bonobo research site, run by Japanese scientists of Kyoto University. Wamba has survived a number of political upheavals in the region. Chronic bloodshed in Congo meant that at the time of her study Isabel was the first western person in more than 20 years to do bonobo research at Wamba. = Burning Man and ethology in festivals = Behncke highlights how social gatherings are a natural and fundamental part of our lives as highly social animals. Doing human ethology at festivals like Burning Man in the desert or Carnival in Brazil, she has studied how the function of parties isn't for excessive indulgence; rather, parties enable social and economic interaction and integrate and build our social complexity = Applied human sciences = Isabel Behncke has developed a style of knowledge integration that she applies to current human issues. She uses evolutionary, behavioural and ecological sciences to derive principles relevant to the capacity to adapt to change both of individuals and organisations. She is often an invited guest to teach and participate in think-tanks issues that require trans-disciplinary approaches, such as the future of cities as social habitats, depression and mental health, behavioural economics and engagement or how to design rituals for organizational change Other activities Isabel studies play as an ethologist and as a direct participant to gain insights on creativity, collaboration, and well-being. In NYC she took up Improv and did a TED Residency talk on the parallels of the creative process of nature and those arising by the rules of improv, titled ‚ÄòDoes nature have a sense of humour?‚Äô Isabel has been avid traveller all her life, and enjoys music, wilderness, large dogs, horses, mountains, and connecting people and ideas.https://www.tvn.cl/programas/10chilenos/capitulos/isabel-behncke-una- aventurera-que-estudia-el-comportamiento-humano-2375978 = Patagonia expeditions and history of exploration = Isabel often participates and co- leads expeditions to Patagonia, highlighting its wild nature as well as its role in the history of exploration. In collaboration with Congreso Futuro in January 2017 she took a group of scientists including Richard Dawkins on board the world's only 1:1 replicahttp://naovictoria.cl/ of HMS Beagle, the ship that took Captain FitzRoy and Charles Darwin around the world, and from whose journey the Origin of Species was eventually born.https://www.futuro360.com/videos/antartica-un-laboratorio-estrategico- para-el-futuro-de-la-humanidad_20190121/ Public speaking In 2011 she was a TED Fellow and gave a talk \\"Evolution's gift of play, from bonobo apes to humans\\". TED main event, 2017, Espa√±ol session ‚ÄòWhy we party?‚Äô, on the natural history of human festivals. TEDx BRC 2014 and TEDx BRC 2016 (together with Esther Perel). Behncke has delivered keynote plenaries at stages as diverse as the Gruter Institute, SUMMIT LA, and Aspen Circles. Other speaking invitations include the United Nations General Assembly NYC, Google Zeitgeist, House of Lords London, SXSW, WIRED, G20, as well as academic meetings such as Human Evolution and Behaviour Society (HBES) and Human Ethology (ISHE). Radio, film & TV = Radio = In October 2013 she appeared on BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity. Her hypothetical donation to this fictional museum was \\"a laughing tree\\", a tree in which Bonobos congregated and laughed such that the tree itself seemed to laugh.

As principal of the firm after his father retired from 1924-1955, he was responsible for many major Art Deco office buildings in capital cities in Australia and New Zealand in the 1930s, as well as many projects for the Catholic Church in Queensland, and the Great Court of the University of Queensland.  Early life  Hennessy was born on 8 January 1887 at Burwood, Sydney. After completing his secondary education at the Christian Brothers‚Äô High School at Lewisham, and St Patrick's College, Goulburn, he studied architecture at Sydney Technical College and at the University of Pennsylvania. He gained experience with firms in America and Sydney, before becoming a partner with his father John Francis Hennessy trading as Hennessy & Hennessy in 1912. John Hennessy retired in 1924, and the firm continued under Jack Hennessy Jnr, retaining the name, though they were also known as Hennessy, Hennessy & Co.  Career  In the 1920s, Queensland Archbishop Duhig commissioned a number of projects for the Catholic Church in Brisbane, including the never-built Holy Name Cathedral, Brisbane. In the 1930s Hennessy designed a series large office buildings for three different insurance firms in three countries, and has been described as Australia's first international architect. Another major project was the Great Court, University of Queensland in St Lucia, Brisbane, built between 1938-1979. In 1950, Hennessy was awarded over ¬£25,000 by the court when he sued to recover his unpaid fees for the Holy Name Cathedral. Hennessy died of heart disease at his eldest son's home in Sydney on September 4, 1955, at the age of 68. He was buried in the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Rookwood. The firm continued until 1968.

Born in Kilkenny, Dwyer first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Patrick's De La Salle. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his senior debut during the 1956 Walsh Cup. Dwyer went on to enjoy a successful career, winning two All- Ireland medals, three Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Dwyer was a one-time Railway Cup medallist. At club level he is a two-time championship medallist with Faughs. Dwyer retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1963 championship. Playing career =Foulkstown= Dwyer began his club career at junior level with the Foulkstown club just outside Kilkenny. He came to widespread prominence as a member of the Foulkstown junior team that lost the County Junior Championship to Glenmore in 1953. =Faughs= After moving to Dublin, Dwyer joined the Faughs club but success came in the twilight of his club career. On 13 September 1970, he won a County Senior Championship medal after scoring 2-01 from full-forward in the 5-15 to 3-09 win over St. Vincent's in the final. O'Dwyer claimed a second winners' medal two years later when he again lined out at full-forward in the 1-12 to 3-02 win over O'Toole's in the final. =Kilkenny= Dwyer joined the Kilkenny senior team in advance of the 1956 Leinster Championship and made his debut on 20 May 1956 when he scored two goals from full-forward in a 6-11 to 3-09 quarter-final win over Westmeath. On 8 July 1956, Dwyer lined out in his first Leinster final, however, Kilkenny suffered a 4-08 to 3-10 defeat by reigning champions Wexford. On 12 May 1957, Dwyer contested his first national final when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the final of the 1956-57 National League. He ended the game on the losing side after a 3-11 to 2-07 defeat. Dwyer lined out in a second successive Leinster final on 4 August 1957 and claimed his first winners' medal after scoring 1-02 in the 6-09 to 1-05 defeat of Wexford. On 1 September 1957, he again lined out at full-forward when Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland final. Dwyer was again amonst the goalscorers and ended the game with his first winners' medal after the 4-10 to 3-12 victory. Dwyer lined out in a third successive provincial decider when Kilkenny qualified to play Wexford in the 1958 Leinster final. He ended the game with a second successive winners' medal after scoring two goals in the 5-12 to 4-09 victory. Dwyer missed the 1959 Leinster Championship, however, he was recalled to the starting fifteen at full-forward for the All-Ireland final against Waterford on 6 September 1959. He scored 1-01 in the 1-17 to 5-05 draw. The replay on 4 October 1959 saw Dwyer again line out at full-forward, however, in spite of top-scoring with five points he ended the game on the losing side after the 3-12 to 1-10 defeat. On 6 May 1962, Dwyer claimed his second national title when Kilkenny defeated Cork by 1-16 to 1-08 to claim the National League title for the first time in 30 years. He was subsequently denied a third Leinster Championship medal as Kilkenny suffered a 3-09 to 2-10 defeat by Wexford in the 1962 Leinster final. Walsh claimed his third provincial winners' medal after making his fifth final appearance in the 2-10 to 0-09 defeat of Dublin in the 1963 Leinster final. On 1 September 1963, he lined out at full-forward for the fourth time in seven seasons against Waterford in an All-Ireland final. Dwyer was held scoreless throughout the hour, but collected his second All-Ireland winners' medal after the 4-17 to 6-08 victory. =Leinster= Dwyer's performances for Kilkenny led to his inclusion on the Leinster inter-provincial team for the 1957 Railway Cup. Munster dominated the competition at the time, with Dwyer losing four finals in his first five seasons with the team. He claimed his only winners' medal on 17 March 1962 when he lined out at full-forward in Leinster's 1-11 to 1-09 defeat of Munster in the final. He ended the competition as top scorer with 6-02.

Zeltwanger entered the primary election against Peter Beck, who was facing dozens of felony charges, and Mary Jo Kubicki. He won the primary with 51% of the vote, and won the general election with 72% of the vote. Zeltwanger works as a real-estate developer. He is a certified public accountant. In August of 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he joined John Becker, Candice Keller, and Nino Vitale in sponsoring a move to impeach against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken \\"issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives\\", calling the move ‚Äúa baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.‚Äù Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an \\"imprudent attempt\\" to cause \\"a state constitutional crisis\\". Legal scholar Jonathan Entin said the proposal \\"means that we‚Äôve distorted our understanding both of what impeachment is supposed to do and how people ‚Äì especially, elected officials ‚Äì are supposed to disagree with each other. Do we really want to say that the government can‚Äôt act in an emergency because the officials are afraid that if they do anything, they‚Äôll be removed from office? Of course, if they don‚Äôt do anything, maybe the response is going to be ‚ÄòWell you should be impeached for not acting.' CNN's Chris Cillizza analyzed it as one of several examples of how Donald Trump had politicized public health matters to the point Republican lawmakers felt they needed to make extreme and pointless moves in order to satisfy the base.

As a scout, he was a member of the Wheeler Survey and assisted General George Crook during the Apache Wars. Banta was influential in the creation of Apache County, Arizona and later represented the county in the Arizona Territorial Legislature. As a newspaperman, he started and operated a number of papers throughout Arizona Territory. For roughly two decades he used the assumed name Charles A. Franklin instead of his birth name. Biography Banta was born to John and Phydelia (or Fidelia) Banta on December 19, 1845, in Warrick County, Indiana. His family moved to Wisconsin in 1848. His formal education ended at age 11. There is no record he ever married. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Banta served as a \\"Three Month Volunteer\\" in the Missouri State Militia. Following his enlistment, he went to work for the Kansas Tribune. On a trip to Kansas City, Missouri, he was arrested by Union soldiers and accused of being a Confederate spy in the service of William Quantrill. Though released, he apparently took umbrage at the treatment he had received. He left his job and worked as a bullwacker from Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe. About this time he began using the name Charles A. Franklin. Franklin arrived in Albuquerque on June 20, 1863. He worked briefly for the Rio Abajo Press, then joined the 1st California Volunteers. In this role he served as a teamster escorting Governor John Noble Goodwin party to the newly formed Arizona Territory. Shortly after his arrival in the Chino Valley, he assisted Editor Tisdale A. Hand in producing two editions of the Arizona Miner, on a press brought to the territory by Richard C. McCormick. He also worked as a cowboy for R.E. Farrington and traveled extensively through the territory, keeping a record of his wanderings in a personal journal. His knowledge of the region prompted the military to employ him as a scout. Though a Democrat, Franklin served as an aid to Governor McCormick with the rank of colonel. In the late 1860, lacking funds for a new set of boots, he acquired the nickname \\"Buckskin Charley\\" after making himself a set of moccasins and a buckskin suit. In 1869, Franklin was a constable in Wickenburg. He moved to Tucson in January 1871, working there for the Arizona Citizen. He continued to serve as a scout and guide, assisting General George Crook during the Apache Wars. In 1871 he was a member of the Wheeler Survey, and served as its chief guide in 1873. In 1873 he was credited with the discovery of Meteor Craterfor a time called \\"Franklin's Hole\\". After leaving Tucson, Franklin was a sub-Indian Agent at Fort Grant. His work as a guide led him to Yuma, and from there he took a steamer to California. There he worked for a short time at the San Diego Union before returning to Arizona Territory. During his travels, Franklin read law and earned admission to the Arizona bar. He became justice of the peace in St. Johns, Arizona, in 1876. The next year he moved to Springerville, where he again was justice of the peace. He then lived briefly in Florence before returning to Tucson. He began a three-week prospecting trip in the Santa Catarina (now called Santa Catalina) mountains with Johnny B. Hart on October 31, 1877. The two men located what the Arizona Citizen called \\"some very rich strikes of gold and silver.\\". Franklin was a deputy sheriff under Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell in late 1877. Franklin returned to Springerville in 1879, becoming the town's first postmaster. He was instrumental in convincing the territorial legislature to create Apache County, and served as county attorney for the new county from 1879 to 1881, and county probate judge from 1881 to 1883. He was County assessor for Apache county in 1880, represented Apache County during the 12th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Following his service in the legislature, Franklin legally changed his name back to Alfred Franklin Banta. Banta served a second term as Apache County attorney from 188991. He also returned to the newspaper business, founding several new papers. He founded the Orion Era in St. Johns and later sold the paper to a group of Mormons. In 1895, he founded the Holbrook Argus. In 1896, founded the Arizona Populist. The Populist was renamed the Pick and Drill following a suggestion by Buckey O'Neill. O'neill also convinced Banta to move to Prescott in 1896. Banta had an opportunity to purchase the Arizona Gazette, but felt the $6,000 offering price to be excessive. In 1902, Banta founded the Douglas Dispatch. A 1900 fire that damaged Prescott's Whiskey Row destroyed the Pick and Drill and dealt Banta a serious financial setback. After the fire, Banta traveled extensively while working a variety of odd jobs. Places visited included New Orleans, California, Florida, New York City, and Panama. In 1914, he settled in Wickenburg. Two years later he moved into the Arizona Pioneer's Home. During his retirement, Banta spent time at the offices of the Prescott Courier chronicling his life. A copy of the document he produced was kept at the Sharlot Hall Museum until its publication in 1952 under the title Albert Franklin Banta: Arizona Pioneer. Banta died in Prescott on June 21, 1924, after several months of declining health. The Grand Canyon \\"Banta Point\\" is named in Banta's honor. Tucson's \\"Franklin Street\\" was named after his work on a surveying crew led by Solomon W. Foreman in March 1872.

It is a fungus that thrives in warm, wet conditions and lives in the soil. It is characterized by a bull‚Äôs eye pattern of dark brown rotting on the tomato fruit, and affects fruit that is close to, or lying on the soil. The easiest management is to keep the plant out of contact with the soil, although other chemical methods can be very effective. This disease commonly occurs in the southeast and south central areas of the United States. The disease has affected a large portion of crop yield in the United States as well as India. The relatively small genome size of Phytophthora parasitica compared to Phytophthora infestans gives researchers the unique ability to further examine its ability to cause disease.  Hosts/Symptoms  Buckeye rot of tomato affects tomato plants, although there are many other plants that are affected, including pepper, potato, tobacco, pineapple, and various other hosts. Upon infection, brown and greyish-green water-soaked spots appear on the fruit. These spots develop into lesions that resemble the markings of a bull's eye with alternating dark and light brown concentric rings. These are very smooth lesions, barely raised, unlike the rough lesions found in late blight (Phytophthora infestans), which is a similar pathogen. Buckeye rot lesions may cover half or more of the fruit and the margins of lesions will be smooth but not sharply defined. Finally, a white fungal-like growth may appear within the lesion. While fruit rot is the most common symptom, damping off and stem cankers are possible. The disease does not affect the foliage of the plant, which further helps separate it from late blight .  Disease Cycle  Zoospores - Reproductive Structure of the Phytophthora Buckeye rot of tomato is soil-borne and therefore affects fruit lying on, or close to, the soil. The fungi are spread by surface water, spattering rain, and furrow irrigation. While it can sexually reproduce through the production of oospores, its primary form of reproduction is by asexually producing sporangia. These sporangia are found at the tips of sporangiophores that emerge through the stomates. Sporangia release zoospores which require water for transport. Zoospores swim in water droplets until they encyst and infect the fruit. Symptoms, beginning with fruit rot, may form within 24 hours. Chlamydospores are the pathogen's resting structure, which allows the disease to survive and overwinter in the soil. The chlamydospores germinate in soil or decaying debris. Through these chlamydospores, the pathogen begins the disease cycle again. The combination of asexual and sexual spores makes this disease polycyclic, therefore it can infect multiple times throughout a season.  Environment  Buckeye rot is favored by warm, wet weather. Temperatures between are ideal for the fruit rot. In order for sporangia to be produced, allowing the pathogen to reproduce, the soil must be wet and above . Zoospores can only disseminate by swimming in water, so excessive rain and irrigation promote growth of the disease. Oospores, on the other hand, can be spread across a field by water runoff, farming equipment, and workers. = Management = Because there are currently no disease- resistant varieties, cultural and chemical control are the only management options.  Cultural control  Once the pathogen is in the soil, avoid fluctuation in moisture, compacting soil, and prevent flooding by providing good drainage. Specifically, keep the tops of the bed dry to avoid the fruit rot. This will provide a less than ideal environment for the pathogen to survive and grow. Crop rotations every 3 to 4 years can be another alternative to control the disease. Since the pathogen is found in the soil, avoiding contact of the fruit with the soil can decrease infection. You can do this by using plant stakes or support cages that will hang the plants above the soil. Another control is mulching with newspapers, plastic, and other materials that will prohibit soil from splashing up on the plants during heavy rainfall. Chemical control  Applying fungicides that contain chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb, or metalaxyl as the main ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4‚Äì8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.  Importance  = United States = One of the first reports of Buckeye rot of tomato occurred in Florida in 1917. Later, in 1921 the first epidemic of it occurred in an experimental field in Indiana. It persisted throughout the summer infecting other hosts as well. It resulted in destroying up to 40 percent of the tomato plants grown. In Maryland, tomatoes are the second most important vegetable crop grown, accounting for 8.6 million dollars in profit. Annually, 25-30 tons of tomatoes are processed in Maryland. Tomatoes are also the second most economically important vegetable in Pennsylvania. Fresh tomatoes account for 2.1 million dollars in cash receipts and 26-28,000 tons are produced by growers every year. Buckeye rot is one of the most important diseases to control in Pennsylvania. Maryland is able to manage it through a combination of chemical and non-chemical treatment, whereas in Pennsylvania, Buckeye rot of tomato is controlled through a three-year crop rotation schedule. = India = In 2013, the Hindustan Times reported that in India, Buckeye rot of tomato has led to damage in 30-40 percent of tomato crops. In 2012, the price of a tomato in India ranged from 0.20-0.33 dollars per kg; however, in 2013 when the disease hit, the price rose to 0.33-0.65 dollars per kg.

The store was closed and Mangalal went to work for his brother Hasmukh Shah, who then owned a shop called Nakuru Mattresses. Following the closure of their father's business, Atul Shah and his brother, Vimal Shah opened a clothing store that they named Furmatts, which among other things, sold bed sheets which the brothers stitched at home. In 1978, due to booming business, supported by the 1970s coffee boom in East Africa, the two sons and their father managed to pay off the KSh1.2 million debt. They bought Nakuru Mattress from their uncle, who relocated to the United Kingdom. Nakumatt supermarkets Under new ownership, Nakuru Mattress and Furmatts began integrating their operations. From two stores Nakuru town in 1978, they diversified the list of items on offer. In addition to clothes and mattresses, they began selling saucepans, cooking pots, plastic basins and umbrellas, among other products. In 1984, they opened a store in Eldoret, their first outside of Nakuru. In 1986 the retail chain expanded to Nairobi, with a store on Ukwala Road. Over the next 30 years, the supermarket chain has grown into the largest retailer in Kenya, with over 36 stores, employing over 4,500 people. In 2008, the retailer opened its first outlet outside of Kenya, in Kigali, Rwanda. New branches in neighboring Uganda followed in 2009. The first store in Tanzania came in 2011. The retail chain has plans to expand operations to Burundi and South Sudan in the next two to three years. Wealth In 2013, Atul Shah is reported to have valued shareholders' equity in the retail chain at US$400 million (KSh34 billion at that time). The privately owned family business does not publish its financial statements. However, given that the family is the majority shareholder, Atul Shah is one of Kenya's wealthiest individuals.

Built in 1928, it is one of four multi-span Warren deck truss bridges built in the state after extensive flooding in 1927. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Gilead Brook Bridge is located in northern Bethel, carrying Vermont Route 12 across Gilead Brook just south of its junction with Gilead Brook Road. It is a four-span Warren deck truss bridge, resting on concrete abutments and piers. It is long and wide, and rises about above the brook. The trusses are assembled with rivets, and the approach spans consist of rolled I-beams with extra plates on the lower flange for additional reinforcement. The bridge deck is concrete, with concrete curbs, and carries two lanes of traffic. The bridge was built in 1928 as part of a major bridge-building program after extensive flooding in the state in 1927. At that time, Route 12 was one of the major north-south routes in the White River valley between White River Junction and Montpelier. It is one of only four Warren deck truss bridges built at the time, and is nearly identical to the former Ottauquechee River Bridge, which carried United States Route 5 in Hartland. These types of trusses were used by the state to replace the longest spans, and was well suited to the deep stream bed and inclined route of the roadway.

Life and career Jane Conger Belson Shiman√© was born in Missouri. She studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, where she met the artist Jordan Belson. Though she used his name, they never legally married. Her first film, Logos, premiered in 1957 and was screened at festivals in North America, Europe, and Latin America. The animated film featured an electronic score by Henry Jacobs, a sound artist who also collaborated with her husband on the groundbreaking \\"Vortex\\" light shows. In 1959 she made Odds & Ends, a short animated film that pokes fun at the avant-garde film culture of the 1950s. To make the film, she combined recycled travel and advertising footage with her own animations ‚Äî made from paper cutouts, color fields, and line drawings ‚Äî and added a \\"faux hipster\\" narration by Henry Jacobs, with bongos playing in the background. (Jacobs is credited as \\"Rheny Bojacs,\\" an anagram of his name.) The narrator natters pretentiously about poetry and jazz, contradicting himself at every turn, one moment claiming that \\"money doesn't count\\" and the next mentioning the possibility of grants and subsidies. The satire, which appears to have been aimed at her husband, may have precipitated the end of their marriage. In 1960 Odds & Ends won a Creative Film Award, a cash prize awarded by the film society Cinema 16 and the Creative Film Foundation (the scholarship established by Maya Deren for experimental filmmakers). Other winners that year included Robert Breer, Bruce Conner, Ed Emshwiller, and Stan Vanderbeek. Upon receiving the award, Shiman√© responded, \\"I don't know just what to say other than I have been extremely impressed with the works of other film makers and 'I just got high and put it together.'\\" The film is included on Treasures IV: American Avant-Garde Film, 1947-1986, a DVD set published in 2008 by the National Film Preservation Foundation. Both Logos and Odds & Ends have been preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in 2001 and 2006, respectively. Shiman√© apparently stopped making films soon after parting with Belson.

He is known for a passage in the Analects in which he expressed his ambition as no more than being content with daily life. He was the father of Zeng Shen, or Master Zeng, one of the most prominent disciples of Confucius. Life Zeng Dian was born in 546 BC, only five years younger than Confucius. He was a native of South Wu City in the State of Lu. The Analects (11.26) records a famous conversation between Confucius, Zeng Dian, and three other disciples of the Master‚ÄîZilu, Ran You, and Zihua. Confucius asked his students to express their ambitions. Zilu said he wanted to govern a troubled state and turn it around, Ran You wanted to rule a territory and make it prosperous, while Zihua merely wished to be a competent official. When Confucius asked Zeng Dian, Zeng unhurriedly finished playing his zither, and said he wanted something different: Unexpectedly, Confucius endorsed Zeng Dian's wish, rather than the moral and political ambitions of his other disciples. According to the interpretation of the influential philosophers Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, this passage signifies Confucius' view that the mind of a real sage is at ease and not always worrying about the moral boundary, and is capable of enjoying an artistic way of life and celebrating the creations of Heaven. Son Zeng Dian was the father of Zeng Shen, later known as Zengzi or Master Zeng, and revered as one of the Four Sages of Confucianism. When Zeng Shen was 16, Zeng Dian sent him to study under Confucius. Zeng Shen would later teach Confucius' grandson Zisi (Kong Ji), who was in turn the teacher of Mencius, thus beginning a line of transmitters of orthodox Confucian traditions. Zeng Shen was famous for his filial piety. After the deaths of Zeng Dian and his wife, he was unable to read the rites of mourning without bursting into tears. His story is included in the Yuan dynasty text The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars. The L√ºshi Chunqiu records an anecdote of Zeng Dian and his son. When Zeng Shen did not return on time after going on a mission, many feared he might have died, but Zeng Dian said: \\"Though he may be in mortal danger, so long as I still survive how would he dare perish?\\" Honours In Confucian temples, Zeng Dian's spirit tablet is placed in the hall of Confucius' ancestors. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Zeng Dian the nobility title of Count of Su (ÂÆø‰ºØ). During the Song dynasty, he was further awarded the title of Marquis of Laiwu (ËêäËï™‰æØ).

After a naval career which took him to Indochina, China, and Japan, he left the service and devoted the rest of his life to scholarship. He was most famous for his studies of ancient Chinese astronomy. He was the younger brother of Ferdinand de Saussure, the pioneering linguist and semiotician, and Ren√© de Saussure, a Swiss Esperantist and mathematician. Career L√©opold de Saussure was born in Switzerland, just outside Geneva, in the hamlet, Creux de Genthod. His family were Protestants with roots in Lorraine, France who had come to Geneva after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1588. His father, Henri Louis Fr√©d√©ric de Saussure, was a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist and a constant traveler and explorer who wrote treatises on the insects of Africa and had an encyclopedic range of interests. From his early teens de Saussure set out to make a career in the navy, an undertaking which one historian called \\"a somewhat problematic undertaking in Switzerland.\\" Saussure, with his father's permission, became a French citizen in order to enter the √âcole Navale, and in 1885 went to sea as a cadet.Hans Hagerdal, \\"Why Sinologists Look East\\" in Paul van der Velde, et al., ed., New Developments in Asian Studies (New York: Routledge, 1998), p. 104 In 1887, he successfully demanded admission to the Ecole des Langues orientales vivantes in Paris. Psychology of Colonisation (1899) He spent the years 1889-1891 in Indochina, then a French colony, as well as in Japan, but mainly in China, where he served on the gunboat Aspie, which cruised the Yangtze River. de Saussure gathered not only linguistic experience, particularly in Vietnamese, but a stock of anecdotes and ideas on Asian history and writings, most of which he later abandoned, however. He took part in the French campaign in Dahomey before family concerns obliged him to resign his commission. On his return to France, he applied his energies entirely to research. After publishing an article on Korea, he published his first major work, Psychologie De La Colonisation Fran√ßaise (1899). The volume offered an analysis of the assimilation of the French language among colonialized peoples. He echoed some of the linguistic concepts of his brother, Ferdinand, but subscribed, as Ferdinand did not, to the concept of a \\"psychological race\\" modeled on the concept \\"historical race\\" offered by Gustave le Bon. de Saussure argued that both the French and Spanish empires would dissolve because they did not recognize the unbridgeable divisions between the superior and lower races, while his linguist brother did not view racial differences as absolute or predetermined. The heavenly spheres from Les Origines De L'astronomie ChinoiseIn the years from 1899 to 1922, de Saussure published dozens of articles, especially in the Paris journal T'oung Pao, the leading outlet for sinology in Europe. The subjects included ancient Chinese astronomy, calendars, zodiac, as well as the influence of ancient middle- eastern cultures on China. He argued, however, that Chinese astronomy influenced Babylonian astronomy in the face of those who assumed that China must have been influenced from the outside. A group of these articles were reprinted after his death. de Saussure died 30 July 1925 in Geneva, after a mysterious illness confined him to bed for almost ten years. Scholarly contributions de Saussure, since he had practical experience as a sailor, was able to use his knowledge as a practical navigator to show that even James Legge and other well-known sinologists had not correctly understood the astronomical references in such works as the Shujing. Joseph Needham, the historian of Chinese science, calls Saussure's long series of papers \\"still indispensable\\" and says that he possessed \\"considerable sinological knowledge,\\" though not as much as some.

The mountain, and Sky Pilot Rock near Desolation Sound are named for the United Church's mission boat Sky Pilot. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Sky Pilot is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Sky Pilot.

Notable for being among the first integrated programs to offer integrated services to the Lao Theung populace of southern Laos, it became a victim of its own success. Its lean efficiency led to its being crowded out of funding by more expensive programs. Background Beginning in 1950, the United States gradually slid into supporting a proxy war in the Kingdom of Laos. In time, it took over support of the Royal Lao Government and the Royal Lao Armed Forces. The latter was centered in five separate military regions, with few lines of communication to link them. As a result, the generals in command of military regions tended to act autonomously from one another or from a central command.Castle, pp. 7-35. During the Laotian Civil War, the Royal Lao Army in Military Region 4 of Laos chose a policy of minimal aggression toward the communist troops shielding the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the eastward reaches of the MR. Mu Ban Samaki becomes the Wapi Project Laotian General Phasouk Somly Rasphakdi, who commanded MR 4, began investigating possibilities for a civic action program in Wapikhamthong Province as early as 1963. The development zone envisioned by the general would stretch from the Mekong River eastward through the lowlands to Salavane. Its populace was largely Lao Theung hostile to the Royal Lao Government. It was a fertile rice growing area. On 25 June 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy approved National Security Action Memorandum 249. One of its provisions called for the Central Intelligence Agency to increase their Auto Defense Choc troops to 23,000 militia. The new ADC would be used to link up zones of Royal Lao Government influence and to safeguard the villages within them, similar to the Strategic Hamlet Program in Vietnam.Ahern, pp. 161-162. It took two years to fully involve Americans from the U.S. Embassy in the concept that was dubbed Mu Ban Samaki by the Lao. The proposed Auto Defense Choc (ADC) program would train militia that would provide security to new assistance programs in schooling, public health, and agriculture. The first pilot program, launched in late 1963, was concentrated in six locations scattered along the Mekong Valley from Sayaboury to Attopeu. It was run by a disorganized committee of U.S. Embassy staff members. By mid-1964, the pilot project in MR 4 at Houei Kong was the only one prospering, due to its unitary command and security from the 400 remaining militia from Operation Pincushion. At the same time, overall security in MR 4 was diminished when an 1,800 man regiment of regulars was transferred out to join Operation Triangle on the Plain of Jars in Military Region 2.Conboy, Morrison, p. 141.Ahern, pp. 196-197. The transformation of Mu Ban Samaki into the Wapi Project was based on explicitly linking the newly offered civic services to a militia effort to defend them. The Wapi Project was offered to a population of about 120,000. Half of those were estimated to be communist sympathizers; however military intelligence reported only 300 communist guerrillas among them. Even pro-communist village leaders were swayed by such improvements as agricultural cooperatives.Ahern, pp. 199-200. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) cooperated in the effort. This made it among the first integrated civic aid projects in Indochina, and it ran at a relatively low cost. The ADC training camp opened at a site dubbed PS 18 in November 1965; it would train militia for a year.Conboy, Morrison, p. 145. One of the three CIA case agents assigned to the ADC effort had experience dealing with Lao Theung from a previous assignment with Operation Pincushion.Conboy, Morrison, p. 148. In April 1965, the Wapi Project doubled in size as it extended into the Sedone Valley. The communists there ruled by coercion, so the new government project found fertile ground for its expansion. By June 1966, the Wapi Project had pacified 5,400 square kilometers of Laos. However, by the end of 1966, with American interest fading, Phasouk also turned back toward military action.Conboy, Morrison, p. 170. However, he did manage to evade joining the CIA's nascent road watch program, fearing the distraction from the Wapi Project.Shackley, p. 143. During the first half of 1967, new CIA Chief of Station Theodore Shackley withdrew the Agency's support, dooming it.Ahern, pp. 267-268. Ironically, the Wapi Project's efficiency doomed it in the battle for budgeting, as more elaborate efforts with larger budgets choked it out of existence.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 141-142. Aftermath The militia, which had been raised for home defense, were pressed into offensive service in Special Guerrilla Units. They did not make very determined soldiers. In March 1968, Pathet Lao troops moved in to commandeer the rice harvest in the old Project Wapi area. The Lao communists propagandized against the remaining effects of the Project.Conboy, Morrison, p. 198. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

During the Second World War, Lupo was involved in several naval actions, including that of the eponymous \\"Lupo convoy\\", for which she was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valour. Lupo was sunk in action in December 1942. Construction Lupo was built in the late inter-war period by CNQ, Fiume, one of the Alcione sub-group of the numerous Spica class of torpedo boats. She was laid down on 7 December 1936, launched 7 November 1937, and commissioned 20 February 1938. Lupo was armed with three 100mm guns in single mounts, and four 450mm torpedo tubes; she also had two depth charge throwers and equipment for laying mines.Conway p302 The Spica class ships all bore astronomical names; Lupo was named for the constellation Lupus, the wolf. Service history At the entrance of Italy into the Second World War Lupo was stationed at Rhodes, as leader of the VIII Torpedo Boat squadron with sister ships Lince, Libra and Lira. There she was involved in escort duties and actions in the war against Greece. In December 1940 Lupo and the VIII Sqdn came under the command of Frigate Captain Francesco Mimbelli, with whom she would achieve fame. On 31 January 1941, with Libra in company, Lupo attacked British convoy AN 14, en route to Piraeus. Despite the escort of three destroyers Lupo was able to torpedo the tanker Desmoulea, which was unable to complete her journey.O'Hara p80 The disabled Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, where she remained as a stationary store ship for the rest of the war. In February Lupo, with Lince (and joined later by destroyers Sella and Crispi) took part in the re-conquest of the island of Kastellorizo, which had been seized by British commandos.O'Hara p82 In May Lupo was charged with escorting a convoy of 20 caiques and other small vessels transporting some 2,300 German troops to Crete, as reinforcements to the German paratroop assault on the island. On the night of 22/23 May the convoy was intercepted by a British force of three cruisers and four destroyers. To cover the escape of the convoy Lupo attacked the British vessels, firing her torpedoes and laying smoke. She came under heavy fire, and was hit by 18 large calibre shells, though only three exploded. Lupo passed through the British force, avoiding collision with a cruiser, and escaped, leaving the British force in some confusion (Orion reported damage from friendly fire as the cruisers tried to hit Lupo). The British force went on to chase down and sink eight of the caiques, but were left short of ammunition from the night action and were forced to withdraw before dawn; Lupo was able to return to the scene and rescue many of the survivors. Six caiques managed to slip away.O'Hara p119 One caique and a cutter, both of them detached from the convoy, eventually reached Crete. For this action Mimbelli was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour, while Lupo had the Silver Medal placed on her ensign. After this action Lupo gained the reputation as \\"the luckiest ship in the Italian Navy\\".O'Hara p149 Lupo in 1941 After repair and refit Lupo returned to escort duty in the Aegean: In October while escorting a convoy from Crete she attempted to save sister ship Altair, which had been mined. The crew were saved, but Altair sank during the night under tow. In November, in company with Cassiopeia, Lupo escorted two German merchants from Athens to Benghazi (the Maritza convoy) This came under attack by the British Force K, two cruisers and two destroyers. Lupo again attacked this superior force, while Cassiopeia led the merchants to safety. However, despite their efforts both merchant ships were sunk, and Lupo damaged.O'Hara p148-150 In March 1942 Mimbelli left Lupo for a command in the Black Sea, while Lupo joined the escort force on the central convoy route to Libya. In September 1942, Lupo, with three sister ships escorted three merchants to Tobruk; after coming under air attack the convoy scattered. Lupo and Castore, with one ship, arrived safely; the other two merchants and an escort were sunk. That same month Lupo, with Sirio, escorted three ships from Crete to Tobruk. They came under submarine attack, but escaped without loss. In November Lupo was escorting three merchants (the Veloce convoy) when she was sunk in action.O'Hara p203 Fate On 30 November 1942 Lupo, in company with three sister ships under command of Corvette Captain Giuseppe Folli, left Naples to escort the merchant ships Veloce and Chisone to Tripoli. A third ship, the tanker Devoli, detached herself from the convoy to Trapani. On 2 December the convoy was attacked by aircraft from Malta; Veloce was hit twice and set on fire. While the other ships continued, Lupo stood by the sinking Veloce to render assistance to the survivors. The two vessels were eventually found south of the Kerkennah bank by a force of four destroyers which were tracing the convoy, led by HMS Jervis. Lupo was quickly overwhelmed by gunfire from the destroyers; Lupo sank in a few minutes, and the blazing wreck of Veloce followed shortly after. Arethusa, aware of the destroyers' attack, shepherded Chisone to Tripoli, while Ardente headed to the wreck site at dawn. She rescued 29 men from a crew of 134 officers and ratings. Captain Folli was lost with his ship.Connell p Notes References * G. G.

Sida Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia varicosa is classified in subgenus Vermilacinia in which it is distinguished from related species by its thallus divided into relatively few fan-shaped branches (less than 10)‚Äîwidely expanded above a short narrow stalk-like base‚Äîand by its secondary metabolites of terpenoid compounds that generally characterize the subgenus: an unknown T3, the triterpene zeorin and the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane, with an accessory Œ≤-orcinol depsidone, salazinic acid. The broadly expanded branches from base to apex is similar to V. robusta, which differs by its thallus divided into tubular shaped branches, but it is difficult to judge from pressed specimens to what degree branches of V. varicosa are inflated in its natural form. Vermilacinia rosei, also collected by Rose from Isla San Roque, appears morphologically indistinguishable, differing only in chemistry of the triterpenes, which have taxonomic significance from a phytogeography point of view Vermilacinia johncassadyi, for example, which has the T1,T2 triterpenes, and is found only in the Vizca√≠no Desert, is morphologically similar but geographical separated from V. laevigata, a species of the California Floristic Province that differs morphologically by stalked apothecia and chemically by the lichens substances generally found in the subgenus. Vermilacinia cedrosensis and V. reptilioderma are similar species with the same chemotype differences but are not geographically separated, however, they show slight differences in cortical features; while their taxonomic distinction is complicated by the related species V. paleoderma and V. polymorpha that overlap only partly in their geographical distribution. Emphasis has been given to chemical characters because they correlate with known phytogeographical and ecological differences in vascular plants as outlined in Richard Spjut‚Äôs introduction and taxonomic keys to the species. This is in contrast to Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh who felt the ‚Äúchemical based taxonomy of the 1940s‚Äì1960s‚Äù was history, which should be abandoned;Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. \\"Niebla\\". ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2‚Äô: 368‚Äì380. however, the trend now is to favor more species; for example, 126 species were recognized from a single lichen species.Robert L√ºcking, Manuela Dal-Forno, Masoumeh Sikaroodi, Patrick M. Gillevet, Frank Bungartz, Bibiana Moncada, Alba Y√°nez-Ayabaca, Jos√© Luis Chaves, Luis Fernando Coca, and James D. Lawrey. 2014. A single macrolichen constitutes hundreds of unrecognized species. PNAS 111(30): 11091‚Äì11096 The triterpenes T1,T2 appear as major lichen substances in thin-layer chromatography. Lacking DNA phylogeny data, and detailed knowledge of their biosynthetic pathways, which in this case appears to involve the mevalonic acid pathway, it is difficult to determine whether the terpenes (T1,T2) are additive, or are an ancestral trait to the other compounds more widely distributed in the subgenus Vermilacinia. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia varicosa, described in 1996 by Spjut, was considered by Bowler and Marsh in 2004 to be the same as V. laevigata, among five other species. Among the species recognized by Bowler and Marsh, V. varicosa resembles V. robusta more than V. laevigata, but it would appear that the apparent flattened branch morphology is the character attribute that was given taxonomic weight. No explanation was provided by Bowler and Marsh as to why all these species belonged to just one species.

The film stars Jordan Christopher, Jill O'Hara, Robert Walden, Kate Reid, William Redfield and Lois Nettleton. The film was released on October 28, 1970, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Three years after graduating from Princeton, disillusioned Jonathan is driving a Manhattan taxicab and expressing his disgust with the world by insulting his obnoxious passengers and kicking pigeons in Riverside Park. His circle of acquaintances includes Winslow Smith, a motorcycle-riding, leather-jacketed, self-styled rebel, whose image is undermined by the fact that at 24 he is still a virgin; Oliver, a homosexual interior decorator who stages elaborate parties and tries, unsuccessfully, to seduce his male guests; and Jennifer, a 21-year-old tenant in Jonathan's building, whose sojourn in New York City to \\"find herself\\" is being subsidized by her parents. While attending one of Oliver's wild soirees, Jonathan is accosted by a nymphomaniacal former bedmate, Naomi, who drags him into the bathroom, strips off her clothes, and invites him to join her in the fur-lined tub. Instead, he returns to his apartment, visits Jennifer, and explains why he must maintain emotional detachment. Jennifer, however, is such an understanding listener that she and Jonathan are soon making love. At Christmas, Jonathan takes Jennifer to spend the holidays in Darien, Connecticut, with his suburbanite parents‚Äîa possessive and petulant mother and a potentially alcoholic stepfather. But his mother angrily discovers Jonathan and Jennifer nude in the bed, and after a seasonal party leads to further generation gap warfare Jonathan and Jennifer abruptly return to the city. Although drawn to Jennifer, Jonathan is soured by the prospects of married life and is even becoming increasingly apathetic toward his friends. One night, attempting to explain his disenchantment to Jennifer, he enters her apartment and finds her in bed with Winslow. Shattered, Jonathan dazedly drives his cab through the city until finally, in a rage, he plunges off the docks into the river. Recovering in the intensive care unit of a hospital, Jonathan is visited by his friends as well as by Jennifer, who pleads for a second chance to demonstrate her love. Instead Jonathan slips out of the hospital, packs his bags, and boards a train for Des Moines, Iowa. There he plans to drive a truck and continue his isolated existence of thumbing his nose at the world.

She was first introduced to the plight of Human Trafficking around the world when she attended a training conducted by the organization Concerned Women for America and the United States Justice Department in 2005. She returned home with the commitment of opening a shelter for girls victims of this crime. She quickly realized that there was very little knowledge about trafficking in persons in Mexico; Orozco set out to remedy that, and in 2007 opened the first shelter for girls in Mexico City. After four years of learning and speaking to anyone she could about the topic, she realized that without a strong law, this crime could not begin to be eradicated. She was invited by the PAN Party to run for congress, although she never officially registered or affiliated to the party, she did win the seat. From 2009 to 2012 she served as Deputy (Congresswoman) of the LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress representing the Federal District. She held a number of committee positions, including president of the Special Commission for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons. She campaigned for a change to human trafficking laws and was a key player in the passage of the General Law to Prevent, Punish and Eradicate Crimes of Human Trafficking and to Protect and Assist the Victims of This Crime, in 2012. After her time in congress, she became a full-time activist dedicated to the protection of victims of trafficking and to continue pushing for stronger legislation. Rosi is the President of United vs Trafficking. In 2013 Rosi Orozco helped establish and launch a Trafficking in Persons hotline for the purpose of receiving and giving attention to reports on trafficking by citizens. Out of her own volition, Orozco asked to be investigated by the Central Investigation for Special Causes Agency of the State of Mexico City's District Attorney Office; after accusations came from a sitting senator that she was profiting by government funds and of having a network of companies on behalf of her relatives to obtain contracts and agreements for public resources, all of these accusations came within the context of a strong opposition to reforms being pushed through in the Senate that would gravely affect the current Law and would set traffickers free. Rosi Orozco was found to be clean of all the accusations, and thus has taken legal action against the Senator. During the Global Sustainability Network Summit in February 2019, the Secretary of Human Rights of the State of Mexico communicated that the agency that he heads would postulate Orozco as a candidate to the Nobel Prize for her trajectory as a Human Rights activist. The letter of intent has been sent to the Nobel Foundation.

It infects plants that are of pine classification.Peterson, Glenn W., and James A. Walla. \\"Naemacyclus (Cyclaneusma) Needle Cast of Pines.\\" (n.d.): n. pag. Web. . After infection by Cyclaneusma, most pines do not display symptoms until 10 months after the initial infection. Symptoms include needles developing yellow spots, horizontal brown bands around the needles, swelling of needles, and off-white fruiting bodies formed on infected needles.SLJ. \\"Cyclaneusma Needle Cast of Pines.\\" Cornell University Department of Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology (2012): n. pag.

Because Cyclaneusma is an ascomycete it produces two spore types, an asexual (conidiomata) and sexual (ascomycota) spore. Controlling Cyclaneusma has presented a challenge as the disease can survive on both living and dead needles during the winter months. Effective management methods include planting new pines in non-shaded, well drainable soil as well as spraying fungicide. Cyclaneusma Needle Cast is an important fungal disease because it directly impacts the commercial value of decorative pines as well as lumber.  Hosts and symptoms  = Hosts = Cyclaneusma primarily attacks Scots pines. Austrian white, Eastern white, and ponderosa pines are also among the infected. Young Scots pines have been infected in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas in the US. There have also been many incidents in New Zealand. Cyclaneusma has been seen on ponderosa pines in North Dakota and Nebraska. During early autumn, needles within the interior of the infected tree begin to develop yellow spots. As the fall progresses and the temperature drops, the infected needles become darker while brown horizontal bands appear on the needles‚Äô surface. From October until about May, off-white fruiting bodies called pseudothecia appear on the yellow needles. This is a macroscopic sign as the fruiting bodies swell with moisture making them visible to the naked eye. The yellowing of needles that occurs in early September actually leads to premature ‚Äì or the first detection of ‚Äì needle-cast which causes a stunted growth. The most infected needles are prematurely shed by December. Because the infected needles are within the interior of the tree, the newer needles on the outer surface of the pines are flushed green and resistant to the disease. However, the premature shedding of needles in the interior can extend outwards leading to a loss in overall growth. The distribution of Cyclaneusma is not uniform but scattered with symptomatic and unaffected trees in close proximity with one another.\\"NZ Farm Forestry - Cyclaneusma Needle-cast of Pines.\\" NZ Farm Forestry - Cyclaneusma Needle-cast of Pines. New Zealand Forest Research Institute, 2010. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. = Symptoms = Needle cast diseases in general are somewhat difficult to diagnose simply because their symptoms are similar to low pH, poor nutrition, fertilizer or chemical burn, and even root rots.Sidebottom, Jill R. \\"Christmas Tree Notes.\\" NEEDLE CAST DISEASES IN CHRISTMAS TREES. NC State University, 1 Nov. 1995. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. Correct diagnosis requires microscopic examination of the size and shape of the fungal producing ascospores. These fungal spores are produced quite infrequently; after the disease infects needles, it will not produce symptoms or additional spores until the following year. In addition, Cyclaneusma may not be the only fungus present on the diseased needles.Kowalski, T. (1988). Cyclaneusma (Naemacyclus) minus an Pinus sylvestris in Polen. European Journal of Forest Pathology, 18, 176‚Äì183. Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0329.1988.tb00916.x/abstract Saprophytic fungi live on dead tissue and may therefore continue to worsen the infection on needles after they have fallen. Saprophytes will also be present if the needles were killed by fertilizer burn or root rots. Due to these obstacles, it is important to examine the spores directly after infection (while spores are being produced) in order to ensure that Cyclaneusma is indeed the pine‚Äôs cause of death.  Disease cycle  Cyclaneusma is an Ascomycete and therefore contains a sexual and asexual stage. During the asexual stage, conidia are produced which are capable of dispersing throughout the season.Cyclaneusma minus. (n.d.). CABI. Retrieved from http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/35675 Additionally, Cyclaneusma produces a sexual stage by the Ascomycota. These Ascomycota are apothecial in shape and once infection of the host occurs, they locate to the subepidermal tissue of the host‚Äôs pine needles. As these apothecium develop, it will push on the epidermis of the needle causing a swelling of the needle to occur bilaterally. During favorable environmental conditions (moist environment), the apothecium will produce asci typically containing eight ascospores. These spores will disperse from fruiting bodies of the pine either through the wind or remain on the needle for prolonged periods of time.Watt, M. S., Palmer, D. J., Bulman, L. S., & Harrison, D. (2012). Predicting the severity of Cyclaneusma needle cast on Pinus radiata under future climate in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science, 42, 65‚Äì71. Cyclaneusma minus. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/35675 As the ascospores travel through the wind, they will land on new susceptible pine hosts. If conditions continue to be favorable, Cyclaneusma will enter the new host‚Äôs needle through the stomata and infect the plant. Cyclaneusma has four primary periods of infection throughout the year. During the months of July through August, Cyclaneusma can infect the current year‚Äôs needles. Following this cycle, September through November as well as late November through early December accounts for the 2nd and 3rd infection respectively. During this time, the cooler, moist environment promote infection of Cyclaneusma. These three periods account for 50% of all new Cyclaneusma infections. As winter persists, Cyclaneusma will survive on pine needles attached to the tree as well as the needles no longer attached to the host.Prihatini, I., Glen, M., Wardlaw, T. J., & Mohammed, C. L. (2014). Multigene phylogenetic study of Cyclaneusma species. Forest Pathology, 44(4), 299‚Äì309. doi:10.1111/efp.12101 The months between April through June account for the remaining 50% of infection by Cyclaneusma. This is because the moist, cool conditions allow the disease to infect both mature and newly growing needles. It is worth noting that while spores are consistently produced throughout the spring, summer, and fall months; symptoms of Cyclaneusma may not appear on pines until at least 10 months after the initial infection.  Environment  Cyclaneusma is favored by wet, humid, above freezing conditions. This provides adequate conditions for Cyclaneusma to thrive in the given environment. A study analyzing Cyclaneusma on Pinus radiata determined that continuous climate change (global warming) would favor the infection of pines by Cyclaneusma because much more of the environment would consist of moderately warm, wet, and humid conditions. Additionally, higher altitude elevations favor Cyclaneusma due to the wetter environment. The high demand for pine trees during the holiday month of December can contribute to the success of Cyclaneusma. The clustering of pines in a limited area of land enable the disease to spread its ascospores over short distances but through high concentrations of susceptible hosts and therefore poses a problem for Christmas tree production companies.Chou, C. K. S. (1991). Perspectives of disease threat in large‚Äêscale Pinus radiata monoculture‚Äêthe New Zealand experience. Forest Pathology, 21(2), 71‚Äì81. doi:10.1111/j.1439-0329.1991.tb00946.x Cyclaneusma does not appear to be affected by insect vectors.  Management  When choosing a site for plantation establishment, it is typically good practice to ensure it exhibits good drainage and is non shaded. It should not be next to old Scotch pine stands, which could still hold the Cyclaneusma. The trees in the plantation should have adequate spacing to allow for proper air circulation. Additionally, the owner should invest in tree stock which displays resistance or tolerance to Cyclaneusma. After planting, attentive tree care must be undertaken, including nutrient management and water and weed control, to ensure robust, healthy trees. To scout for the disease, the threshold level is 20% of sampled trees showing signs. At this point, the owner should consider treating the entire plantation. In some areas, it is possible to control the disease through the silvicultural practice of thinning, selecting for trees with resistance to Cyclaneusma. Cyclaneusma presents somewhat of a challenge to manage, as infected needles remain part of the tree throughout the winter and spring months. The creation of spores as well as infection can occur in freezing temperatures with wet needles. Inoculated needles may not develop symptoms for up to a year from the infection date, proving difficult for the effectiveness of pesticides applied in the first season to be judged. Infected needles on or under the tree retain the ability to release spores any time during the growing season, so they should be removed as soon as possible. It is typically recommended to apply five treatments of fungicide, such as chlorothalonil or dodine, when the threshold level is met, beginning in March and continuing roughly every 5‚Äì6 weeks through October. If the infection level of a Christmas tree plantation is not yet too high, the aesthetics of the tree can be saved by using a leaf blower to remove infected needles from the tree.  Importance  This disease greatly reduces the aesthetic, commercial value of decorative trees, as well as lumber yield. Cyclaneusma is one of the most important diseases of forests in New Zealand. A study set up in 1977 measured the disease severity of a tree stand over a six-year period. Healthy trees were shown to exhibit 100m^3/ha more stem volume than infected. Projected revenue loss of lumber from diseased trees was expected to be $3200/ha. Disease levels assessed in 2005 and 2006 in New Zealand attributed nearly $40 million in lost revenue per year. In 2010, an outbreak of Cyclaneusma on Swiss mountain pines in Italy affected nearly 90% of the trees, exhibiting symptoms anywhere from yellowing of the needles to transparent crowns.AN OUTBREAK OF CYCLANEUSMA MINUS NEEDLE CAST ON SWISS MOUNTAIN PINE ( PINUS UNCINATA ) IN ITALY FIRST REPORT OF A NEW FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM CAUSING CARNATION WILT IN COLOMBIA. (2011), 93, 6709307. Therefore, it is important that growers recognize signs and symptoms of Cyclaneusma early in order to maximize profits.

During the Second World War, Lince was involved in several naval actions before she was sunk in August 1943 by a British submarine. Construction Lince was built in the late inter-war period by CNQ, Fiume, one of the Alcione sub-group of the numerous Spica class of torpedo boats. She was laid down on 7 December 1936, launched 15 January 1938, and commissioned 1 April 1938. Lince was armed with three 100mm guns in single mounts, and four 450mm torpedo tubes; she also had two depth charge throwers and equipment for laying mines.Conway p302 The Spica class ships all bore astronomical names; Lince was named for the constellation Lynx, after the big cat of that name. Service history At the entrance of Italy into the Second World War Lince was stationed at Rhodes with the VIII Torpedo Boat squadron, together with sister ships Italian torpedo boat Lupo, Libra and Lira. There she was involved in escort duties and actions in the war against Greece. In January 1941 Lince, in company with Lupo, attacked British convoy AN14, en route to Piraeus. Despite the escort of three destroyers Lince was able to distract them while Lupo torpedoed the tanker Desmoulea, which was disabled for the rest of the war.O'Hara p80 Italian official sources, however, reported that the ship that assisted Lupo in the attack was actually the torpedo boat Libra. In February, Lince, again with Lupo, (and joined later by the destroyers Sella and Crispi) took part in the re-conquest of the island of Kastellorizo, which had been seized by British commandos.O'Hara p82 In April Lince, in company with Libra and the destroyer Crispi, encountered Allied convoy GA 15 engaged in evacuating troops from Greece. Despite the strong escort Lince and her companions made a spirited attack, claiming several hits, though the Allied commander later reported no losses.O'Hara p116 In February 1942 went to the aid of the tanker Lucania, which had been torpedoed, and, with Circe, took part in an anti-submarine hunt which resulted in the sinking of the British submarine Tempest. In August Lince was assisting the freighter Iseo, which had been attacked by the British submarine Porpoise. Lince counter-attacked, resulting in damage to Porpoise which was forced to return to base. In November Lince was badly damaged in an air attack off Tripoli, suffering the loss of her commander and many of the crew. She was able to dock in Tripoli for repairs, but with the retreat of the Afrika Korps towards the city her master received orders in January 1943 to scuttle the ship to avoid a capture. However her crew endeavoured to bring her home, arriving at Trapani despite Allied attacks at the end of the month. In July Lince returned to escort duty, but was lost in August after she ran aground. Fate On 4 August 1943, en route from Taranto, Lince ran aground at Punta Alice, near Ciro Marina, Calabria. Despite efforts to re-float her, Lince was discovered on 28 August by the British submarine Ultor, and hit with two torpedoes. The ship was destroyed, though casualties were slight as her crew had been evacuated, leaving only damage control parties.

BILOM comprised a demi- brigade of three battalions, the first of which entered service on July 6, 1948 as the \\"1re Bataillon d'Infanterie l√©g√®re d'Outre-Mer\\". History Envisaged as an occupation and policing force for France's overseas colonial possessions like French Guiana and French Polynesia, BILOM was conceived on May 27, 1948, when Minister of Justice Andr√© Marie sent a memorandum to the French prison system's regional directors enquiring as to the number of political prisoners who might be interested in serving overseas to \\"make amends vis-√†-vis the nation\\". BILOM units were not originally intended for the front line counter-insurgency campaigns they later fought, but rather, were viewed as replacements for the French Foreign Legion (FFL) troops deployed throughout the French colonial empire who were desperately needed in the First Indochina War. The ranks of BILOM included former members of the German Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Kriegsmarine, and French collaborationist organizations like the Milice and the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF), and Frenchmen who served voluntarily in the German armed forces, including in the SS Charlemagne Division. Enlistments in BILOM would be for a period of three, four or five years, depending on the duration of the sentence remaining to be served. Prisoners with outstanding sentences longer than 15 years were ineligible, as were men over 40. BILOM units were not part of the FFL, and they were structured as light infantry with no heavy weapons. And although the men would be released from prison, they were not offered legal amnesty‚Äîonly a suspensive pardon. Furthermore, the former prisoners could not serve as their own officers, who would instead be French colonial troops. They were not eligible for promotion, wore no insignia and carried no pennant or unit flag. Nevertheless, according to Dr. Krisztian Bene of the University of P√©cs, successful completion of one's enlistment in BILOM offered national outcasts the chance for \\"reintegration into French society\\". By late August 1948, less than 500 volunteers had joined BILOM, after the French Communist Party (PCF) orchestrated a propaganda campaign against the brigade. The PCF sought to incite public hostility towards the government's effort, and demanded \\"vengeance, justice and punishment\\" of collaborators. Disbandment The BILOM was formally disbanded on 29 July 1949, although most of its personnel continued to serve in smaller detachments attached to locally recruited units in Southern Annam. They were eventually dispersed, some remaining with the French Army in Indochina and Algeria and other returning to civilian life.

The Standard Chinese word xuanchuan \\"dissemination; propaganda; publicity\\" originally meant \\"to announce or convey information\\" during the 3rd-century Three Kingdoms period, and was chosen to translate Russian propag√°nda in the 20th-century People's Republic of China, adopting the Marxist-Leninist concept of a \\"transmission belt\\" for indoctrination and mass mobilization (Shambaugh 2007: 26). Xuanchuan is the keyword for propaganda in the People's Republic of China and propaganda in the Republic of China. Terminology The Chinese term xuanchuan compounds xuan \\"declare; proclaim; announce\\" and chuan or \\"pass (on); hand down; impart; teach; spread; infect; be contagious\\" (DeFrancis 2003: 1087, 124). Numerous common Chinese words are based upon xuanchuan, such as: xuƒÅnchu√°np«ên ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥ÂìÅ \\"propaganda/publicity material\\", xuƒÅnchu√°ndu√¨ ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥Èöä \\"propaganda team\\", xuƒÅnchu√°nhu√† ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥Áï´ \\"propaganda poster\\", xuƒÅnchu√°ndƒÅn ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥ÂñÆ \\"propaganda slips/sheets\\", xuƒÅnchu√°ng«îd√≤ng ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥ÈºìÂãï \\"agitprop\\", and xuƒÅnchu√°n di√†ny«êng ÂÆ£ÂÇ≥ÈõªÂΩ± \\"propaganda film\\". In lexicographic terminology, a bilingual dictionary provides \\"translation equivalents\\" (rather than \\"definitions\\") between the source and target languages. Sometimes words have complete equivalents, such as translating French chien as English dog; but other times have partial or alternative equivalents, such as translating French veau as either the animal calf or the meat veal (Svens√©n 1993: 143-157). English propaganda and publicity are alternative equivalents for Chinese xuanchuan. The classical Chinese word qing Èùí \\"green; blue; black\\", representing the distinction of blue and green in various languages, is a better known example of Chinese-English alternative translations. Compare the color range across collocations like qƒ´ngc√†i ÈùíËèú \\"green vegetables; greens\\", qƒ´ngjƒ´n ÈùíÁ≠ã \\"blue veins\\", qƒ´ngtiƒÅn ÈùíÂ§© \\"azure sky\\", qƒ´ngb√π ÈùíÂ∏É \\"black cloth\\", or qƒ´ngk√®m«é ÈùíÈ®çÈ¶¨ \\"gray mare\\". Translation equivalents of xuanchuan in major Chinese-English dictionaries include: *\\"to declare; propaganda\\" (Mathews 1943: 431) *\\"propaganda; to carry on propaganda (for)\\" (Chao and Yang 1947: 61) *\\"propagate; propagandize; publicize; propaganda (work, bureau, etc.)\\" (Lin 1972: 687) *\\"conduct propaganda; propagate; disseminate; give publicity to\\" (Wu 1979: 782) *\\"propagate; disseminate; propagandize; give publicity to; publicize\\" (Ding 1985: 1162) *\\"to publicize; to promote; propaganda; promotion\\" (Liang and Chang 1992: 322) *\\"publicize; propagate; advocated; advertise; preach; blaze sth. abroad [about]; whoop\\" (Wu 1993: 2886) *\\"propagate; disseminate; give publicity to\\" (DeFrancis 2003: 1087) Thus, the most frequent English lexicographical translations of xuanchuan are , , , , , and . Many languages besides English have different words to distinguish \\"propaganda\\" and \\"publicity\\", for instance, German Propaganda and Werbung, or Russian propag√°nda –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≥–∞ÃÅ–Ω–¥–∞ and rekl√°ma —Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞ÃÅ–º–∞. Few languages besides Chinese have one polysemous word; excluding Sinoxenic loanwords from Chinese such as Japanese senden ÂÆ£‰ºù \\"propaganda; advertisement; publicity\\", one example is Irish bolscaireacht \\"publicity; propaganda; claptrap. Historical usages The Hanyu Da Cidian is a historical dictionary that gives chronologically arranged usage examples, comparable with the Oxford English Dictionary. The xuanchuan entry gives three meanings (tr. Edney 2014: 22): xuƒÅnb√π chu√°nd√° ÂÆ£Â∏É‰º†Ëææ \\"to announce or convey information\\", xi√†ng r√©n ji·∫°Ãångjiƒõ shu≈çm√≠ng Âêë‰∫∫ËÆ≤Ëß£ËØ¥Êòé, ËøõË°åÊïôËÇ≤, j√¨nx√≠ng ji√†oy√π ËøõË°åÊïôËÇ≤ \\" to explain something to someone, or to conduct education\\", and chu√°nb≈ç ‰º†Êí≠, xuƒÅny√°ng ÂÆ£Êâ¨ \\"to disseminate or publicize\\". First, the meaning of \\"to announce or convey information\\" was originally recorded in the historian Chen Shou's (3rd century) Records of the Three Kingdoms in contexts of transmitting (esp. military) orders. For example, the biography of Shu Han dynasty General Ma Zhong (Shu Han) (d. 249) records that after defeating rebels in Nanyue, he was appointed General Who Pacifies the South and ordered back to the capital in Chengdu. \\"In 242, when [Ma Zhong] was returning to court, upon reaching Hanzhong, he went to see Grand Marshall Jiang Wan, who conveyed an imperial decree that he was also appointed General in Chief of Zhennan Circuit [in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi].\\" Later usage examples are cited from historian Li Baiyao (564‚Äì647), poet Cao Tang ÊõπÂîê (fl. 860-874), and scholar Wang Mingqing ÁéãÊòéÊ∏Ö (1163-1224). Second, the xuanchuan meaning of \\"to explain something to someone, or to conduct education\\" first appeared in Ge Hong's (c. 320) Baopuzi criticism of effete scholars who Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75-88) extravagantly rewarded. > These various gentlemen were heaped with honors, but not because they could > breach walls or fight in the fields, break through an enemy's lines and > extend frontiers, fall ill and resign office, pray for a plan of > confederation and give the credit to others, or possess a zeal transcending > all bounds. Merely because they expounded an interpretation [xuanchuan] of > one solitary classic, such were the honors lavished upon them. And they were > only lecturing upon words bequeathed by the dead. Despite their own high > positions, emperors and kings deigned to serve these teachers. (tr. Ware > 1966: 231) Subsequent usages are quotes from monk-translator Pukong ‰∏çÁ©∫ or Amoghavajra (705‚Äì774), poet Wang Yucheng (954‚Äì1001), novelist Ba Jin (1904-2005), and Mao Zedong (1893-1976). Mao's (1957) \\"The speech for the Chinese Communist party National Propaganda Work Meeting\\" (tr. Leung 1992: 379) says, \\"Our comrades who are engaged in propaganda work have the task of disseminating Marxism. This is a gradual [task of] propaganda and should be done well, so that people are willing to accept it.\\" Third, the modern xuanchuan meaning of \\"to disseminate or publicize\\" occurred in Lao She's (1937) Camel Xiangzi or Rickshaw Boy (tr. Goldblatt 2010: 48), \\"As promised, Old Man Liu told no one of Xiangzi‚Äôs experiences [selling stolen wartime camels for 30 yuan], but the camel story quickly spread from Haidian into the city.\\" The Hanyu Da Cidian gives two other usage examples from novels by Zhao Shuli (1906-1970). The Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (2001) entry for the Japanese word senden ÂÆ£‰ºù differentiates three meanings and notes their earliest recorded usages: \\"Convey a statement, transmit widely\\" (Ëø∞„Åπ‰ºù„Åà„Çã„Åì„Å®. „Å≤„Çç„Åè‰ºù„Åà„Çã„Åì„Å®.; c. 758-797 Shoku Nihongi); \\"Explain to people the existence or effect of a thing, principle, policy, etc., seeking their understanding. Or such movement or activity. Propaganda\\" („ÅÇ„ÇãÁâ©„ÅÆÂ≠òÂú®„ÇÑÂäπËÉΩ„Åæ„Åü„ÅØ‰∏ªÁæ©‰∏ªÂºµ„Å™„Å©„Çí‰∫∫„ÄÖ„Å´Ë™¨Êòé„Åó, ÁêÜËß£„ÇíÊ±Ç„ÇÅ„Çã„Åì„Å®. „Åæ„Åü, „Åù„ÅÆÈÅãÂãï„ÇÑÊ¥ªÂãï. „Éó„É≠„Éë„Ç¨„É≥„ÉÄ.; 1924, Kanson Arahata's Entering Russia); and \\"Spread a rumor that is unrealistic or exaggerated\\" (‰∫ãÂÆü‰ª•‰∏ä„Å´Â§ß„Åí„Åï„Å´Ë®Ä„ÅÑ„Åµ„Çâ„Åô„Åì„Å®.; 1930 Riichi Yokomitsu's Machine). Propaganda and publicity Whether xuanchuan is translated as either propaganda or propagandize versus publicity or publicize depends upon the Chinese collocation and context, and the English semiotic connotations. For English and Chinese translation equivalent examples, political propaganda and zh√®ngzh√¨ xuƒÅnchu√°n ÊîøÊ≤ªÂÆ£‰º† are usually pejorative, but public health propaganda and g≈çngg√≤ng w√®ishƒìng xuƒÅnchu√°n ÂÖ¨ÂÖ±Âç´ÁîüÂÆ£‰º† are not. Some xuanchuan collocations customarily refer to \\"propaganda\\" (e.g., xuƒÅnchu√°nzh√†n ÂÆ£‰º†Êàò \\"propaganda war\\"), others to \\"publicity\\" (ch«énp«ên xuƒÅnchu√°n Áî¢ÂìÅÂÆ£‰º† \\"product promotion\\"), and still others can ambiguously refer to either (xuƒÅnchu√°nyu√°n ÂÆ£‰º†Âëò \\"propagandist; publicist\\"). Xuanchuan contexts can vary from covert black propaganda (such as astroturfing) that misrepresents its source to overt white propaganda (such as a public service announcement) that truthfully states its source. Chinese contexts determine the word's semantic connotations. For instance, the term G√≤ngch·∫°Ãånd«éng de xuƒÅnchu√°n ÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖöÁöÑÂÆ£‰º† \\"Communist propaganda\\" generally has positive connotations in Chinese Communist Party usage but negative ones in Kuomintang usage. In official CCP discourse, xuanchuan \\"propaganda\\" has a neutral or positive connotation, but in informal usage, the word often has a pejorative connotation (Edney 2014: 22, 195). For instance, in 2009 a group of Chinese academics and lawyers called for a boycott of the major China Central Television network and sarcastically said the program Xinwen Lianbo \\"Network News\\" should be called Xuanchuan Lianbo \\"Propaganda News\\" (Edney 2014: 195, Chen 2009). David Shambaugh (2007: 29), the scholar of Chinese politics and foreign policy, describes \\"proactive propaganda\\" in which the Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Department writes and disseminates information that it believes \\"should be used in educating and shaping society\\". In this particular context, xuanchuan \\"does not carry negative connotations for the CCP, nor, for that matter, for most Chinese citizens.\\" The sinologist and anthropologist Andrew B. Kipnis (1995: 119) says unlike English propaganda, Chinese xuanchuan is officially represented as language that is good for the nation as a whole. \\"Although no American government would describe its own declarations as propaganda, the CCP is proud of its xuanchuan.\\" Propaganda and publicity have undergone considerable diachronic change in meaning. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, propaganda was first recorded in 1718, referring to the Latin title Congregatio de Propaganda Fide \\"Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith\\" \\"a committee of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church having the care and oversight of foreign missions\\". The religious meaning was extended to \\"any association, systematic scheme, or concerted movement for the propagation of a particular doctrine or practice\\" in 1790, and specialized to \\"the systematic propagation of information or ideas by an interested party, esp. in a tendentious way in order to encourage or instill a particular attitude or response\\" in 1908. The linguist Adrian Room (1991: 216) suggests that the \\"bad\\" sense of propaganda emerged on the political scene in the United States. Publicity was first used to mean \\"the quality of being public; the condition or fact of being open to public observation or knowledge\\" in 1791, and subsequently specified to \\"public notice; the action or fact of making someone or something publicly known; the business of promotion or advertising; an action or object intended to attract public notice; material issued to publicize\\". Most standard English dictionary definitions of propaganda note the word's negative connotations; either through explanation \\"ideas or statements that are often false or exaggerated and that are spread in order to help a cause, a political leader, a government, etc.\\" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1993), or through a usage note \\"The systematic dissemination of doctrine, rumour, or selected information to propagate or promote a particular doctrine, view, practice, etc.; ideas, information, etc. disseminated thus (frequently derogatory)\\" (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1993). In contrast, standard Chinese- Chinese dictionary definitions of xuanchuan (see the Hanyu Da Cidian above) neither mention that the term can have a pejorative connotation nor highlight any connection between the act of propagandizing and the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the information that is being disseminated (Edney 2014: 22). As China's involvement in world affairs grew in the late 20th century, the CCP became sensitive to the negative connotations of the English word propaganda, and the commonly used Chinese term xuanchuan acquired pejorative connotations (MacKinnon 1997: 4). In 1992, Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin asked one of the CCP's most senior translators to come up with a better English alternative to propaganda as the translation of xuanchuan for propaganda targeting foreign audiences (Schoenhals 2008: 125). Replacement English translations include publicity, information, and political communication domestically (Brady 2009: 73), or media diplomacy and cultural exchange internationally (Edney 2014: 24). CCPPD officials left the xuanchuan in official Chinese names the same but changed the English translations from \\"Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China\\" to \\"Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China\\" (Shambaugh 2007: 47), and changed \\"Central Propaganda Department\\" to \\"Central Publicity Department\\" (Hassid 2007: 415). English-languages sources rarely use either \\"Publicity Department\\" translation. The Zh≈çngyƒÅng XuƒÅnchu√°n Sƒ´xi«éng L«êngd«éo Xi«éoz«î, which oversees the CCPPD, continues to be translated as the \\"Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideological Work\\". When Ding Guan'gen, director of the CCP Central Propaganda Department from 1992 to 2002, traveled abroad on official visits, he was known as the Minister of Information (Chen et al. 2002: 287).

Early life Dudkin was born in Newark, New Jersey on June 25, 1908. He graduated in 1929 from New Jersey Law School (now Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark). He was a member of the McClellan Law Club, a debating society, and won the Chester Sherman Prize for legal research. He was admitted to the New Jersey State Bar Association in 1931. He was also a 1951 graduate of the New Jersey Institute of Fire, Casualty and Life Underwriters. Background From 1941 to 1949, Dudkin served as an Acting Judge of the Criminal Courts for the City of Newark. From 1949 to 1956, he served as the Secretary of the Newark Insurance Fund Commission. He later served as an Assistant Essex County Prosecutor. In 1948, Dudkin was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey's 12th district against five-term Republican Congressman Robert Kean. Kean defeated Dudkin by 4,737 votes, 63,232 (50.8%) to 58, 495 (47.0%). President Harry Truman, campaigning in Newark on October 6, endorsed Dudkin, saying: \\"That means that here in Newark you're going to send Peter Rodino to the Congress, and Hugh Addonizio and Harry Dudkin to the House of Representatives. Every one of these men deserves your support. They will fight your battle in Washington, and how that fight needs to be made nobody knows better than I do. They will fight your battle there, and men like them all over the Nation will be fighting that battle--and will win that battle if you're behind us--the battle for the people, a fight which started with Jefferson, continued with Jackson, was won by Franklin Roosevelt in 1934.\\" Dudkin ran again in 1950, and lost by 8,598 votes, 54,123(53.1% to 45,525 (44.7%). Dudkin was married to Hanna Levitin (1910 ‚Äì 1993) of Norfolk, Virginia. They had one daughter, Gail Elizabeth, who married Ronald Merson. Death On March 5, 1987, Dudkin was murdered while working at his family stationery store in East Orange, New Jersey. \\"At first, detectives theorized that he had fallen and hit his head, but an autopsy the next day uncovered a .38-caliber slug in his head,\\" the (Newark) Star-Ledger wrote in a story about cold cases. \\"By the time detectives canvassed the neighborhood, the crime was two days old.\\" Only then did investigators realize that the store's daily receipts were missing.\\" Dudkin was 79.

The 1938 revision replaced the New York City Board of Aldermen with the New York City Council, and it also created the New York City Planning Commission. The 1963 revision of the New York City Charter extended the Borough of Manhattan's \\"Community Planning Councils\\" (est. 1951) to the outer boroughs as \\"Community Planning Boards\\", which are now known as \\"Community Boards\\". This revision also increased the size of the New York City Council from 25 members to 35. The 1975 revision of the New York City Charter set the number of Community Districts/Boards to 59, established the position of the district manager for the community districts, and created the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) which gave the community boards the authority to review land use proposals such as zoning actions, and special permits.

Background In 1982, the Palmers purchased the Jolly's house for $25,000 under an unconditional purchase agreement. However, when they tried to apply for a Housing Corp mortgage, they were shocked to discover that the government valuation of the house was not $21,000 as they thought, but only $15,500. This mistake made it very hard to qualify for a mortgage for the house. Despite knowing this mistake, they then applied to a Building Society for a mortgage, which they were unsuccessful. The Palmers then tried to cancel the contract due to misrepresentation, and the Jolly's resold the house to a 3rd party for $22,500, and sued them for $4970 in damages. Held The court held that the Palmers could not cancel the contract under section 7(4)(b)(ii) as the sale agreement was not subject to them able to arrange suitable finance. Nor could the cancel under 7(4)(b)(i) either, as the judge ruled that a difference of 11% was not \\"substantial\\", as the law requires. The judge also noted that the Palmer's actions here amounted to affirmation of the contract anyway, making any claim of misrepresentation mute.

It was built to replace a metal truss bridge erected there in 1928. The old bridge, of Pratt through truss design, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and was dismantled in 2007. Setting The Route 15-A Bridge is located in a rural area east of the town center of Morrisville. Route 15-A runs east paralleling the south bank of the Lamoille River, and provides access from the town center to Vermont Route 15, which runs north of the river. The bridge alignment is roughly east‚Äìwest, at a point where the west-flowing river bends temporarily to the north. Historic bridges Prior to the present bridge, two bridges have stood at this site. The first was a covered bridge, known as the Tenney Covered Bridge, which was built in 1833, and was swept away in Vermont's devastating 1927 floods. The second bridge, an iron Pratt truss structure, was built by the Berlin Construction Company as part of a major effort by the state to rebuild its bridge infrastructure after the flooding. It was built using standardized guidelines for bridges of its length (), and used rolled I-beams as a means to speed fabrication. That bridge was closed and disassembled in 2007, and replaced by a temporary span.

The protagonists are two anthropomorphic field mice, and the series began in 1963 with the first volume Guri and Gura. The series is published by Fukuinkan Shoten in Japan. Overview The stories tell of the encounters of twin anthropomorphic field mice, Guri and Gura. Yamawaki accompanies Nakagawa's loosely structured narratives with simple, unsophisticated illustrations. The stories aim at entertaining rather that instructing and thus do not feature moral dilemmas to be overcome. Publication and reception The first volume of the series, titled Guri and Gura, appeared in the children's magazine Kodomo no Tomo in 1963. The series' writer Rieko Nakagawa worked in childcare at the time. As of 2014, the first volume had sold over four million copies, and the series had sold a combined 24.9 million copies worldwide. The first English of Guri and Gura appeared in Britain in 1967; in this translation the castella cake the mice make in the original Japanese becomes a sponge cake more familiar to a British audience. An translation appeared in 1991 under the subtitle The Giant Egg, by an uncredited translator. Later translations have been by Peter Howlett and Richard McNamara. Dozens of other translations have appeared, including Korean, French, Portuguese, Thai, and Esperanto.

They are similar to Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, which classifies the complexity of satisfying finite sets of relations; however, the Max/min CSP/Ones classification theorems give information about the complexity of approximating an optimal solution to a problem defined by S. Given a set S of clauses, the Max constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is to find the maximum number (in the weighted case: the maximal sum of weights) of satisfiable clauses in S. Similarly, the Min CSP problem is to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. The Max Ones problem is to maximize the number of boolean variables in S that are set to 1 under the restriction that all clauses are satisfied, and the Min Ones problem is to minimize this number. When using the classifications below, the problem's complexity class is determined by the topmost classification that it satisfies.  Definitions  We define for brevity some terms here, which are used in the classifications below. * PO stands for Polynomial time optimizable; problems for which finding the optimum can be done in polynomial time, so that approximation to arbitrary precision can also clearly be done in polynomial time. * Conjunctive normal form is abbreviated CNF below. * X(N)OR-SAT stands for a satisfiability problem which is the AND of several boolean linear equations that can be written as XOR clauses. Exactly one literal in each XOR clause must be negated (e.g. x_1 \\\\oplus \\\\lnot x_2 \\\\oplus x_3 = 1). See XOR-SAT. * Min UnCut-complete refers to a complexity class historically defined in terms of a problem named Min UnCut. Such problems are APX-hard but with an O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) factor approximation. * Min 2CNF-Deletion-complete is another complexity class historically defined via a problem. Such problems are APX-hard but with an O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) approximation. * Nearest Codeword-complete is yet another such complexity class. Such problems are inapproximable to within a 2^{\\\\log^{1-\\\\epsilon}(n)} factor for some \\\\epsilon. * Min Horn-Deletion- complete is yet another such complexity class. Such problems are inapproximable to within a 2^{\\\\log^{1-\\\\epsilon}(n)} factor for some \\\\epsilon, but are in Poly-APX, so they have some polynomial factor approximation.

Skin friction drag is caused by the viscosity of fluids and is developed from laminar drag to turbulent drag as a fluid moves on the surface of an object. Skin friction drag is generally expressed in terms of the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between inertial force and viscous force. Flow and effect on skin friction drag Laminar flow over a body occurs when layers of the fluid move smoothly past each other in parallel lines. In nature, this kind of flow is rare. As the fluid flows over an object, it applies frictional forces to the surface of the object which works to impede forward movement of the object; the result is called skin friction drag. Skin friction drag is often the major component of parasitic drag on objects in a flow. The flow over a body may begin as laminar. As a fluid flows over a surface shear stresses within the fluid slow additional fluid particles causing the boundary layer to grow in thickness. At some point along the flow direction, the flow becomes unstable and becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow has a fluctuating and irregular pattern of flow which is made obvious by the formation of vortices. While the turbulent layer grows, the laminar layer thickness decreases. This results in a thinner laminar boundary layer which, relative to laminar flow, depreciates the magnitude of friction force as fluid flows over the object. Skin friction coefficient = Definition = C_{f} = \\\\frac{\\\\tau_w}{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho v^2} where: * C_{f} is a skin friction coefficient. * {\\\\rho} is the density of a fluid. * {v} is the free stream speed, which is the fluid speed far from the body's surface. * {\\\\tau_w} is a skin shear stress on a surface. * {\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho v^2} is the dynamic pressure of a free stream. The skin friction coefficient is a dimensionless skin shear stress which is nondimensionalized by the dynamic pressure of a free stream. =Laminar flow=  Blasius solution  C_{f} = \\\\frac{0.664}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Re}_x}} \\\\ where: * Re_x = \\\\frac{\\\\rho vx}{\\\\mu}, which is the Reynolds number. * x is the distance from the reference point at which a boundary layer starts to form. The above relation derived from Blasius boundary layer, which assumes constant pressure throughout the boundary layer and a thin boundary layer. The above relation shows that the skin friction coefficient decreases as the Reynolds number (Re_x ) increases. =Transitional flow=  The Computational Preston Tube Method (CPM)  CPM, suggested by Nitsche, estimates the skin shear stress of transitional boundary layers by fitting the equation below to a velocity profile of a transitional boundary layer. K_1(Karman constant), and {\\\\tau}_w(skin shear stress) are determined numerically during the fitting process. :u^{+} = \\\\int_0^{Y^+}\\\\frac{2(1+K_3y^+)dy^+}{1+[1+4(K_1 y^+)^2(1+K_3y^+(1-exp(-y^+/K_2))^2]^{0.5}}\\\\,dy^+ where: * u^{+} = \\\\frac{u}{u_{\\\\tau}},~u_{\\\\tau}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{{\\\\tau}_w}{\\\\rho}},~y^+=\\\\frac{u_{\\\\tau}y}{ u} * y is a distance from the wall. * u is a speed of a flow at a given y. * K_1 is the Karman constant, which is lower than 0.41, the value for turbulent boundary layers, in transitional boundary layers. * K_2 is the Van Driest constant, which is set to 26 in both transitional and turbulent boundary layers. * K_3 is a pressure parameter, which is equal to \\\\frac{ u}{\\\\rho}{u_{\\\\tau}}^3\\\\frac{dp}{dx} when p is a pressure and x is the coordinate along a surface where a boundary layer forms. =Turbulent flow=  Prandtl's one-seventh-power law  :C_{f} = \\\\frac{0.027}{Re_x^{1/7}}\\\\ The above equation, which is derived from Prandtl's one-seventh-power law, provided a reasonable approximation of the drag coefficient of low-Reynolds- number turbulent boundary layers. Compared to laminar flows, the skin friction coefficient of turbulent flows lowers more slowly as the Reynolds number increases. =Skin friction drag= A total skin friction drag force can be calculated by integrating skin shear stress on the surface of a body. :F = \\\\int\\\\limits_{surface}C_f \\\\frac{\\\\rho v^{2}}{2}dA  Relationship between skin friction and heat transfer  In the point of view of engineering, calculating skin friction is useful in estimating not only total frictional drag exerted on an object but also convectional heat transfer rate on its surface. This relationship is well developed in the concept of Reynolds analogy, which links two dimensionless parameters: skin friction coefficient (Cf), which is a dimensionless frictional stress, and Nusselt number (Nu), which indicates the magnitude of convectional heat transfer. Turbine blades, for example, require the analysis of heat transfer in their design process since they are imposed in high temperature gas, which can damage them with the heat. Here, engineers calculate skin friction on the surface of turbine blades to predict heat transfer occurred through the surface.

It is located in Hamilton County, New York in the West Canada Lake Wilderness Area. T Lake Falls with a height stated of 350 feet up to 600, depending on the source, reasoning behind judgment of the height is the crescent edge at the top of the falls and where the falls officially start. T Lake and the falls have been an attraction because of the several different ways to hike in, and the option of staying at the lean-to at the lake. There is also swimming in the pool at the bottom of the falls in the summer months and snow shoeing, cross-country skiing to the falls to go ice climbing in the winter. The height makes the falls a dangerous place, and several fatalities have occurred there; a 14-year-old boy fell 200 feet into the pool at the bottom of the falls during a summer camp hiking trip on Aug 18, 1960. A 17-year-old girl lost her footing crossing the top of the falls and uncontrollably tumbled down 600 feet on Aug 29, 1973. The coroner‚Äôs physician said she ‚Äòdied of massive head injuries.' Other fatalities that have occurred there were on July 5, 1965 a male went over the falls and died, on Aug 1, 1993 another male went over the falls and died. Rescuers must hike at least 5 miles just to get to endangered persons, and they are sometimes brought out on horseback. There are several memorials at the bottom of the falls for all the people that have lost their lives. Because of these fatalities, the trail beyond the lake and lean-to to the falls are no longer maintained and have been closed by DEC. However some hikers still venture to the falls on their own. The falls is on an unnamed tributary of the South Branch West Canada Creek. This area was used by Native American hunters and first settlers. There are three different ways of hiking into these falls; two of them are from Piseco, NY and the third is from Noblesboro, NY off Mountain Rd. First, is the actual trail head across the road from Poplar Point state campsite. There is a trail sign marking where it begins and states that it is 3.6 miles to the lake where the lean-to is. After the lake, is a 1.8 mile hike to the falls on an unmaintained trail that is difficult to follow. The other way in, coming from Piseco, is bushwhacking off the Mill Stream trail starting on Haskell‚Äôs Road. This way in is considered easier because the trail is flatter, if one has the skills of bushwhacking, from Mill Stream to the state trail. The third way in is off Mountain Home Road, which brings one to the bottom of the falls. It is also the shortest: 5 miles from the trail head to the falls.

L. K.) van Dort (28 July 1831 ‚Äì 24 March 1898) was a 19th-century Ceylonese artist of Dutch Burgher descent.  Early life  J. L. K. van Dort was born on 28 July 1831 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the oldest of nine children, to Johannes Jacobus van Dort (1801‚Äì1876) and Petronella Margaretta n√©e Kalenberg (1806‚Äì1847). The family lived in San Sebastian (Small Pass), which adjoins Pettah, with Van Dort and his siblings attending school at St. Paul's Parochial School in Pettah and Colombo Academy, where the principal, Dr Barcroft Boake, described him as a prodigy and a genius. As art was not a part of a school curriculum Van Dort did not receive any formal training in drawing and painting, although it is likely that he received some tuition from Phillipe Antoine Hippolyte Silvaf and Andrew Nicholl. Silvaf (1801‚Äì1879) was a notable local artist with French ancestry who gave lessons in music and painting from his home in Pettah. Nicholl (1804‚Äì1886) was a distinguished Irish water colourist, who travelled to Ceylon in 1846, where his Belfast patron, Sir James Emerson Tennent, had been appointed as the Colonial Secretary. Tennent secured Nicholl's appointment as teacher of landscape drawing, painting and design at the Colombo Academy. In 1855 Van Dort was employed in the Surveyor-General's office as a draughtsman a position he remained at until he retired.  The Artist  Van Dort is described as having \\"an instinctive artistry\\". He was essentially an illustrator, thinking in terms of black and white, with pen and pencil as his chosen instruments. He rarely used oil or water colours. His deft sketches, reminiscent of the English social caricaturist, Thomas Rowlandson, enabled him to create a vivid \\"on the spot\\" recording of contemporary life in Ceylon. Deloraine Brohier, in her newspaper article describes \\"Wherever he went on journeys his note book and sketch book always accompanied him. As he sat in a railway carriage he would with a few swift lines and smudges unerringly record what he saw and what specially attracted his eye, catching the passing incident or scene. Sometimes along a rustic road he would perch himself on a rock or embankment and interpret the atmosphere. Rural life and ritual sports, palanquins and bullock carts, a rickshaw wallah or horse drawn carriage ‚Äî were featured in many of his sketches.\\" His love of drawing led him to contribute to numerous journals, magazines and newspapers, such as The Ceylon Observer, The Examiner and Muniandi (a Ceylonese version of Punch magazine). In 1868 he sketched a series of law-court characters which were included in Alistair MacKenzie Ferguson's Souvenirs of Ceylon. In 1846 Ferguson became the editor of The Ceylon Observer and in 1859 purchased the newspaper. Between the 30 March and 8 May 1870 Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, visited Ceylon, the first time that a member of the British monarchy had travelled to the country. In 1871 John Capper, the manager and editor of The Times of Ceylon and the editor of Muniandi, published The Duke of Edinburgh in Ceylon, an illustrated record of the Duke's visit, which included a number of illustrations by Van Dort. During the visit Van Dort's work came to the attention of a number of the special correspondents accompanying the Duke, resulting in Van Dort being appointed as staff correspondent for the British weekly newspaper, The Graphic, with his contributions regularly being published over the years. In 1877 Van Dort together with Richard Henricus prepared a number of lithographs for Leopold Ludovici's Lapidarium Zeylanicum, which contains coloured engravings of the crests and heraldry of the early Dutch settlers and their families as found in the Dutch Reformed Church, Wolvendaal, together with drawings of the inscriptions on the tombstones in the churchyard. In 1878 John Capper published Old Ceylon : Sketches of Ceylon Life in the Olden Time, an illustrated description of life in Ceylon prior to the British colonisation. In which a number of the illustrations were provided for by Van Dort. In the late 1870s a large number of villagers in Sri Lanka were suffering from \\"parangi\\", which led to Dr William Kynsey, the Chief Medical Officer in Ceylon, embarking on a programme of research into the disease. The resultant report, Report on The 'Parangi Disease of Ceylon', in 1881, included a number of life-sized water coloured pictures of the different forms of the disease by Van Dort and was presented to the local and international medical community. Parangi was only eradicated in the 1940s with the introduction of penicillin. Between 1888‚Äì89 he was commissioned by the Dutch ambassador in Sri Lanka to paint all remains of Dutch forts, canals and inscriptions. Forty-nine of these watercolours are now housed in a portfolio at Leiden University Library. In 1890 he painted a series of watercolours of the Costumes of the Natives of Ceylon, the majority now reside at the National Museum of Colombo. In 1893 he supplied eight large panels to decorate the Ceylon Building at the Chicago World's Fair and in 1900 some of his paintings were exhibited at the Great Paris Exhibition.  Family life  Van Dort married Cornelia Henrietta n√©e Spittel (27 September 1838 ‚Äì 1 November 1915) on 30 January 1861 at Wolvendaal Church in Colombo. They lived in Galle fort for a number of years before moving back to Colombo, where he built a cottage (\\"Dordrecht\\") in Bambalapitiya. They had two children, Grace (30 September 1861 ‚Äì October 1956) and Ernest Francis (23 January 1865 ‚Äì 6 December 1934), both of whom where artists in their own right. Grace was a leading member of the Ceylon Society of Arts and was the Secretary of the Society, fostering the arts in the country. She painted both in oils and water colours. Van Dort died on 24 March 1898 at the age of 66, of heart disease.  Legacy  In 1951, Hilda Obeyesekere-Pieris, published a collection of forty five of Van Dort's pictures, called Ceylon: the Near Past. His watercolours of 19th-century Sri Lanka can be found at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies () in Leiden. Two of his original lithographs are contained with the Royal Collection (the art collection of the British Royal Family). An extensive collection of his works is kept in the National Museum of Colombo.

Description and history The Waterman Covered Bridge was located in rural southern Johnson, carrying Waterman Road, a secondary road, across Waterman Creek. It was a two-span structure, with a main span that was a queen post truss, and a secondary span of post-and-beam construction. It rested on abutments of stone and concrete, with a timber bent supporting the inner ends of the two spans. The main span was long, and the secondary span , giving the structure a total length of . It was wide, with a roadway width of , carrying one lane of traffic. The exterior was clad in vertical board siding, which extended around to the insides of the portals.

The film stars Tom Stern, Telly Savalas, Robert Vaughn, John Marley, Burgess Meredith and Ivan Dixon. The film was released on August 1971, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot A Vietnam War veteran (Stern) has been using illegal drugs, but eventually decides that he wants to escape that life. But before he can leave it behind, an CIA narcotics agent (Savalas) recruits him to go undercover in Los Angeles to help expose other ex-soldiers who are involved in drug dealing and drug kingpin Neilson (Vaughn).

But its directors, Tom Stern and Lane Slate, have a certain willingness to take each moment as it comes, and its absurdities more often seem the products of a super-active exuberance than of a failed imagination. In its particular field‚Äîsex and violence‚Äî\\"Clay Pigeon\\" just falls short of being very good. Its hero is a Vietnam war veteran turned peaceful Los Angeles hippie (played by Mr. Stern) whom a diabolical Federal agent (Telly Savalas) picks as a decoy to lure an anonymous mastermind of the heroin trade out into the open. The plan works spectacularly‚Äîthough there is no indication of why it should work at all‚Äîand before it is finished, many are the corpses spread over the Hollywood hills. Mr. Stern and Mr. Slate have previously directed one terrible bike movie (\\"Hell's Angels '69\\"), redeemed only by the presence of Conny Van Dyke, a pleasant and unusual actress. In Clay Pigeon they have wisely included three pleasant and unusual actresses ‚Äî most notably Marilyn Akin, as a topless go-go dancer who is also the hero's estranged wife. Miss Akin‚Äîthis is her film debut‚Äîreally isn't such a great actress yet, which doesn't matter because she is the kind of girl you see in the movies not to admire but to fall in love with, and to have found just this kind of rather vulnerable personality for such a role is a small but lovely casting achievement. She is joined by Marlene Clark and Belinda Palmer, and none of them, alas, manage to live through the movie. Release Clay Pigeon was released in theatres in August 1971.

This iron shipbuilding company, located in Pembroke Dock, Wales, was founded by naval architect Edward James Reed in 1874. The company was noted for building the , which was launched June 1877. On the ship yard several merchant ships were built, and also HMS Acorn, a Mariner-class composite screw sloop launched in 1884. While the Royal dockyards revived, the Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. declined,J.D. Davies. Britannia's Dragon: A Naval History of Wales. 2013. p. 80-81. and was resolved in 1890. Burton started working as incorporated accountant settled in ManchesterThe London Gazette, 15 November 1912. p. 4802-3, mentioned Burton as liquidator of a company. with he founded the accountancy firm Burton & Disley. Late 19th century Burton came into prominence as author of several books on cost accounting. His Commercial Management of Engineering Works (1899) and works such as Garcke and Fells' Factory accounts, their principles and practice (1887/89), and J. Slater Lewis' Commercial Organization of Factories (1896) are considered the seminal works, which helped establish the new discipline of cost accounting in Britain.Allen Kent, Harold Lancour (1972). Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 7. p. 384  Work  = The Commercial Management of Engineering Works, (1899) = The Commercial Management of Engineering Works, 1899 In the preface of The Commercial Management of Engineering Works, Burton stated that \\"this work is intended primarily for young engineers. Its object is to present to these young men the problems that are likely to confront them, when commercial duties are thrust upon them, and to offer suggestions that may be of assistance. The work does not claim to represent the results of any scientific research in any special field of factory organization or administration.\\"Hugo Diemer (1910) Factory organization and administration. p. 290 Burton foresaw a special role for the professional accountant in the process of bookkeeping and formation of cost accounts: :The best method of financial bookkeeping, one that admits of perfect balancing, should always be adopted ; but this does not debar such variations as will fit it for the business to which it relates, or the special requirements of the proprietor or manager. There is no insuperable difficulty in making these variations if the staff be properly trained. The great difference between the professional accountant and his clerks, and ordinary commercial bookkeepers is that the former are trained to think, whereas the latter are taught, and often only permitted, to slavishly follow example. Yet alike in methods of bookkeeping, in formation of cost accounts, in details of office arrangements, in management of men, and in distribution of profits, there must be such variations as will fit those methods to the peculiar circumstances of the individual firm. There must, on the one hand, be no want of system, no imperfect recording of accounts or statistics ; and on the other there must be no sacrifice of the substance to the shadow : no abandonment of necessary particulars to the fanciful exigency of interlocking them with a balance- sheet.Burton (1899, p. iv) Burton summarised that he had \\"sought to indicate the manner in which the clerical staff may be made to render valuable services to their employers, without encroaching upon the work of the technical officers, or assuming duties and authority for which they are not qualified.\\" = Brains of the firm = An 1899 review of the book in The Engineer magazine commented, that \\"Mr. Burton's knowledge on certain branches of the commercial management of engineering works is undoubtedly considerable ; and when he deals with book-keeping, auditing, and general office system, its remarks are to the point, and of some value. He tries, however, to do too much; and he deals with many phases of engineering business with which he is apparently but slightly conversant.\\"Review of The Commercial Management of Engineering Works in The Engineer, 17 March 1899. p. 2. The 1899 review gave one example of its inconsistency: :A strange argument adopted in a book professedly dealing with an engineering subject is that to be an engineer is not at all necessary to the satisfactory conducting of an engineering business. According to Mr. Burton, \\"the directors and secretary, the auditor, and the general manager form the brains of the firm.\\" It is not necessary, however, that a single one of the above should be an engineer in the proper sense of the word; and while brains are undoubtedly a useful commodity in persons holding these positions, we fail to see why the officials just named should be accredited with a larger amount of brain power than, let us say, the works manager, or the chief of the drawing-office; nor can we see bow it would be possible to carry on satisfactorily engineering works under brainless shop management, and from designs emanating from brainless draughtsmen. The more interesting parts of this work, according to the review, are the chapters on: 'The Directors and Secretary,' 'The Auditor,' 'The Purchases and Inspection of Machinery,' 'Receipt of Materials and Passing of Invoices,' 'Cost Accounts,' 'The Preparation of Estimates,' 'Drawing office Orders for Work,' 'Alternative Plans for Registering and Filing Drawings,' 'Wages Accounts,' 'Cost Accounts,' 'Profit and Loss,' and 'Stocktaking.' The review eventually concluded that \\"Mr. Burton has, in short, worked out very carefully in his book a system of his own for what he considers to be the best means of conducting an engineering business; and as far as the purely clerical side of the question is concerned, he has done it well enough.\\" = Scientific management = Burton's work is noted as \\"perhaps the first detailed account of the Taylor system in Britain. Among other things, Burton discussed functional foremanship, scientific rate-fixing and the differential piece-rate system.\\"John Cunningham Wood, Michael C. Wood eds. (2002). F. W. Taylor: Critical Evaluations in Business and Management. p. 146.  Reception  Brech (2003) summarised the raise of British approaches to management and the role of Burton: :In the two decades prior to World War I, a number of British writers and consultants had begun to address the problems of management in the modern world. Although they were aware of similar developments in America, where scientific management was becoming the latest business fashion, these writers sought to develop distinctly British approaches to management. Writers such as the engineers Joseph Slater Lewis, A.J. Liversedge and F.G. Burton, the consultants Edward Elbourne and J.W. Stannard, and the accountant Lawrence Dicksee laid stress on the need for a methodical approach to business management, the need to be inclusive and to motivate workers to see the company's goals as their own, and above all the need for more and better training for would-be managers... [Their work shows] the directions in which British management thinking might have gone had not World War I and the subsequent \\"Americanization\\" of British industry intervened. Today, they remain an important example of an alternative way of thinking about and practising management, and demonstrate the plurality and diversity of management thought.Edward F.L.

Common applications include the synthesis of pyrrolidines, and three-, five-, six- and seven-membered heterocycles such as pyrazolidines, aziridines, morpholines. His scope extends further to polycyclic heterocycles and the total synthesis of (+)-aphanorphine. These alkene aminoarylations take place via the cross-coupling of aryl or alkenyl halides with simple aminoalkene substrates to generate the heterocyclic ring with formation of a C-N bond and a C-C bond.\\"Recent Developments in Palladium-Catalyzed Alkene Aminoarylation Reactions for the Synthesis of Nitrogen Heterocycles\\" Danielle M.

In general, JohnPhos is a ligand for the Buchwald-Hartwig Cross Coupling reaction, C-X bond formation, the Heck reaction and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling.\\"JohnPhos.\\" - (2-Biphenyl)di-tert- butylphosphine, 97%. Sigma Aldrich, n.d. Web. 29 Nov. 2014. JohnPhos is a particularly effective ligand for the palladium-catalyzed amination of aryl chlorides, bromides, and triflates. The ligand allows the reactions to take place at room-temperature, and performs well for a wide range of different substrate combinations at 80-110 ¬∞C, which includes chloropyridines and functionalized aryl halides and triflates. JohnPhos is particularly useful for aminations of ‚Äìneutral or electron rich aryl chlorides with a wide variety of amine coupling partners. An example of the catalytic amination of an aryl chloride with N-methylaniline at room temperature is shown in Scheme 3.\\"A Simple, Efficient Catalyst System for the Palladium-Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides, Bromides, and Triflates.\\" John P.

An example of the catalytic amination of an aryl chloride with N-methylaniline at room temperature. Although the high reactivity of the ligand is not completely understood, Buchwald et al. suggest some structural factors that contribute to their effectiveness: the electron rich phosphine group may help the acceleration of the oxidative addition step,Grushin, V. V.; Alper, H. Chem. Rev. 1994, 94, 1047-1062. the steric bulk of the ligands may accelerate the C-N bond forming reductive elimination,(a) Hartwig, J. F.; Richards, S.; Baranano, D.; Paul, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 3626-3633. and the œÄ-system of the ortho aromatic group on the ligand may participate in an interaction with the unoccupied metal d-orbital.Metal-‚Ä∫ interactions have been observed in other palladium complexes.

The arene from the aryl halide is forced to orient perpendicularly to the N-Pd bond, which should stereoelectronically favor reductive elimination.\\"A Simple, Efficient Catalyst System for the Palladium-Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides, Bromides, and Triflates.\\" John P.

His defeat allowed the rebellion to grow into a major threat to the government of Catherine the Great until later army expeditions were able to suppress it. His family name is often transliterated in Western sources as Karr.  Biography  He was the son of Aleksey Filippovich Kar (1680-1756), the head administrator of the Russian Salt Bureau from his marriage to the daughter of a court official and had an older sister named Ekaterina (1720-1804) and a younger brother, Filipp (1734-1809). The family traced its origins back to one Thomas Kerr who traveled on a mission with his brothers for James I of England to the court of Tsar Mikhail and was granted a patent of nobility in 1625. Vasily Kar entered the military service in 1740, but his formal training began in January 1742 when he enrolled in the Corps of Pages. In 1748 he graduated as a poruchik and was assigned to an infantry regiment. In 1757 he volunteered to serve with the Austrian Army and the next year transferred to the French. In this capacity he saw action in the Seven Years' War. By 1763 Kar was back in Russia and had been promoted to colonel. He was in Poland from 1766‚Äì68, serving at the court of Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. On 22 September 1768 he was appointed a brigadier, and the next year was appointed commander of a special combined-arms legion of troops formed for the war against Turkey, christened at first the Foreign Legion but then retitled the Petersburg Legion. On 1 January 1770 he was promoted to major-general. In 1773 he was made overseer of military recruiting in Petersburg. On 15 October of that same year he was sent to the lands of the Yaik to pacify the rebels there. Kar was defeated in battle and fled alongside his troops. For this failure he was ordered dishonorably discharged from the army on 1 December 1773, and was legally forbidden from living in the capital. In 1775 he bought in auction an estate from Prince Boris Vasilyevich Golitsyn, sel'tso Goryainovo, located in today's Kaluga Oblast. Here he spent his days engaged in studying agricultural estate management until he became an expert in it. Kar was judged very harshly by his contemporaries for his failures during Pugachev's rebellion. Decades later, Pushkin, in his own history of the revolt would describe the general's leadership during the crisis as, \\"Feeble, timid, and lacking diligence\\". For his part, while Kar played the part of an amiable and content country squire, he lived quietly and tried to avoid any mention of his once promising military career to his neighbors. After Catherine's death, he was summoned back to St. Petersburg. Emperor Paul permitted him freedom to travel to and from his estate as he pleased. He died in 1806 at his home in Moscow, and was buried at the village of Voskresensky in northern Moscow Governorate, which he had acquired in the preceding years. Kar was married to Princess Maria Sergeyevna Khovanskaya (1756-1833), and together they had four children: Ekaterina, Anna, Aleksey, and Sergei (died 1869). After the death of her husband she retired to a monastery in Kaluga. Both of his sons entered the military and fought against Napoleon's Invasion in 1812. Aleksey would lose a leg at Berezina while commanding an artillery battery, and Sergei would become a decorated cavalry officer in the following campaigns.

Notable players who have previously tucked in their jerseys include Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Patrice Bergeron, Kris Letang, Pavel Datsyuk, Wayne Gretzky and Jaromir Jagr. However, the rule has not been strictly enforced since its introduction to the NHL, as some players, such as Connor McDavid, Evgeni Malkin and Wayne Simmonds have been seen with a slight tuck in their jersey. Rule description The official rule by the National Hockey League is as follows: > NHL Rule 9.5. All protective equipment, except gloves, headgear, and > goaltenders' leg guards must be worn under the uniform. Should it be brought > to the attention of the referee that a player is wearing, for example, an > elbow pad that is not covered by his jersey, he shall instruct the player to > cover up the pad and a second violation by the same player would result in a > minor penalty being assessed. > Rule 9.5 governs all protective equipment, including pants. Players are not > permitted to tuck their jersey into their pants in such a manner where the > top padding of the pant and/or additional body protection (affixed to the > pant or affixed to the player's body) is exposed outside the jersey. The > back uniform number must not be covered or obstructed in any fashion by > protruding pads or other protective padding.\\" The NHL decided to newly enforce uniform policies starting with the 2013‚Äì14 season. As a result, players are not allowed to tuck their jerseys into their pants, expose their elbow pads, or make any other modifications to their jerseys. Violations of this rule (which is called the \\"jersey tuck rule\\") are as follows: * A player who does not follow the jersey tuck rule is to be issued a warning on the first offence. * A player who commits the offence a second time is to be assessed a minor penalty for delay of game. * A player who commits the offence a third time is to receive a misconduct. * A player who commits the offence a fourth time is to receive a game misconduct. It is unclear if the minor penalty will be called for delay of game or an equipment violation. As of 2013, the NHL Department of Hockey Operations and referees are still determining how the penalty will be called. Enforcement Although these policies have existed since 1964, they were not enforced until general managers voted to enforce it in the 2013‚Äì14 season. Some reporters suggested that enforcing uniform rules was the National Hockey League's attempt to reduce freak accidents where a player's body was cut by skate blade while others said the league was laying down rules for eventually selling advertising space that would display prominently on the entire jersey. In a September 2013 pre-season game between the Carolina Hurricanes and the Columbus Blue Jackets, Alexander Semin became the first player penalized for this infraction. After receiving an official's initial warning in that game, his jersey became tucked in again after scoring the second goal in that game. He received the minor penalty 15 minutes later for violating the tuck rule a second time in the game. In response, Semin later stitched his jersey to his pants. However, by early October in the same year, it was reported that the league's hockey operations department would relax on enforcing the tuck rule. The penalty would not be enforced if the jersey was tucked in while skating as long as the jersey was untucked at the beginning of a shift. The rule brings the league in line with other hockey leagues and tournaments, such as the Olympics. Reception Reactions to the tuck rule by NHL players and coaches were overwhelmingly negative. Alexander Ovechkin called the rule \\"stupid\\". Former Washington Capitals head coach Adam Oates also disagreed with the rule, citing that superstar players like Wayne Gretzky and Ovechkin tucking in their jerseys were part of their identity. Toronto Maple Leafs player Joffrey Lupul questioned the rule while Morgan Rielly said he was not aware of this rule until the Semin penalty. Boston Bruins centre Patrice Bergeron, often seen with his jersey tucked underneath his protective pants, said he did not do it intentionally but felt that it could become an issue during regular season games.

The group advocates for curricular changes within schools, in compliance with New York State law. Miller, Jennifer \\"Yiddish Isn't Enough: A Yeshiva Graduate Fights for Secular Studies in Hasidic Education\\" (Nov 21, 2014) The New York Times. Members YAFFED was founded in 2012 by Naftuli Moster, a former member of Brooklyn's Belz Hasidic community. Moster grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, one of 17 children in a Hasidic family. Yiddish was his first language. He attended a yeshiva in Borough Park where secular studies were almost non-existent. Bid For Better Secular Ed In Yeshivas Heading Toward Court The Jewish Week, 11 March 2015 Mission YAFFED's aim is to improve educational curricula within ultra-Orthodox schools, in compliance with New York State Law. They work to raise awareness about the importance of general studies education, and encourage elected officials, Department of Education officials, and the leadership of the ultra-Orthodox world to act responsibly in preparing their youth for economic sufficiency, and for broad access to the resources of the modern world. Their stated mission is to ensure that all students receive the critical tools and skillsets needed for long-term personal growth and self-sufficient futures. Under New York state law, private schools, including yeshivas, are required to provide curricula that are \\"substantially equivalent\\" to those provided in the public schools. According to The New York Jewish Week, while public schools are required to provide at least five hours of education per day, many Hasidic yeshivas only provide 90 minutes of secular education per day to boys, and no secular education to them at all after the age of about 13. According to Moster, YAFFED's strategy has been \\"to get people from within the Hasidic community to speak up and demand a change in the current education system, where 14-year-olds spend 14 hours a day without learning a single word of English, math, science, history, or geography\\". The Jerusalem Post has noted that YAFFED is one of several Jewish activist organizations around the globe, including Israel, the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Belgium, who are working towards having Hasidic yeshivas meet the general standards of secular education.Fight over ad in haredi paper highlights deep divisions The Jerusalem Post, 14 December 2014 Activities YAFFED has advertised its mission by use of billboard advertisements and social media campaigns. One billboard quoted a Mishnaic source, alongside the message: \\"It's your mitzvah. It's the law.\\"\\"Sharp, Sonja 'Huge Billboard Targets Failings of Orthodox Jewish Schools' (June 6, 2013) DNAInfo NY\\" YAFFED is currently exploring legal avenues through which to pressure schools to improve secular education.\\"'New York - Brooklyn Man Hopes Potential State Lawsuit Will Force Basic Secular Education In Chasidic Schools' (Nov. 27, 2014)\\" http://www.vosizneias.com/185632/2014/11/27/new-york-brooklyn-man-hopes- potential-state-lawsuit-will-force-basic-secular-education-in-chasidic- schools/ In the summer of 2015, YAFFED organized a letter writing campaign directed at district superintendents and the New York State Education Department, to inform them of serious concerns regarding the education in numerous Hasidic yeshivas. The DOE subsequently announced an investigation into the matter. YAFFED has stated that if it does not receive an adequate response from the local government, it will explore taking the matter to civil court. YAFFED is seeking to represent parents from within the communities who have children currently enrolled in the schools. According to the Jewish Week, a spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment because the issue might \\"be the subject of future litigation\\". The New York State Education Department referred the matter to the New York City Department of Education. The NYC Department of Education (DOE) announced, in 2015, that it would investigate allegations that nearly 40 ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools, or yeshivas, in New York City were failing to meet state education requirements. But nine months later, the DOE refused to provide any evidence that the investigation had actually begun.City Dragging Heels on Orthodox Jewish Schools Investigation, Critics Say Williamsburg-Green Point Patch, March 28, 2016 Thereafter, YAFFED began an \\"evidence drive\\" collecting materials from \\"yeshiva graduates of Hasidic yeshivas and parents of current yeshiva students\\" that would demonstrate whether Hasidic schools in New York are meeting state-mandated secular education requirements. YAFFED states that it has already collected such materials as textbooks with certain subjects \\"blacked out\\", and report cards for boys of high school age that listed, \\"no secular subjects at all\\".Hasidic 'Evidence Drive' Seeks to Shame DOE The Forward, March 30, 2016 The investigation was still ongoing in August 2018, stymied by the refusal of half of the yeshivas under investigation to allow DOE investigators entry. Richard Carranza, the New York City schools chancellor, promised that \\"appropriate follow-up action\\" would be undertaken. In April 2018, a bill was passed, pushed through the state legislature by state Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat who has caucused with Republicans, that puts ultra-Orthodox yeshivas under the authority of the state, rather than local education officials, called the Felder amendment. In July 2018, YAFFED filed a federal lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state education officials over the Felder amendment, claiming that the Felder Amendment violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by giving special treatment to yeshivos, and also guaranteeing that one of the metropolitan area's fastest-growing student populations will continue to receive \\"a sub-standard secular education\\". YAFFED argued that it was unconstitutional for the New York City and State Education Departments to credit yeshivos for the learning that takes place during the limudei kodesh portion of the school day.https://apnews.com/c8299a53c284445494c0a25e9ccd80f6 In November 2018, the state education department released new guidelines on the substantial equivalency rule, under what all private schools, including religious schools, are supposed to be inspected by local public school authorities every five years.Karen Matthews. November 21, 2018. \\"Ultra- Orthodox schools could face pressure under new rules\\". AP news In January 2019, U.S. District Judge Leo Glasser has dismissed YAFFED's lawsuit over the so-called Felder amendment, ruling that the group lacks standing to sue over it. Glasser implied in his ruling that the new state guidelines might render the group's lawsuit moot. He said that under the new guidelines, the schools covered by the Felder amendment will be required to comply with \\"all of the same curriculum and hour requirements applicable to other private schools\\", and will face additional requirements related to the religious portion of the schools' curriculum. Moster said he disagreed. \\"The revised guidelines embody the separate and preferential treatment of ultra-Orthodox yeshivas, regardless of how the leaders of those schools feel about the guidelines\\", Moster said in a statement. He said the group will press forward \\"in reforming the unjust system\\". The pro-yeshiva group, Parents for Educational and Religious Liberty in Schools (PEARLS), said it applauded Glasser's decision. \\"YAFFED's campaign of harassment of the yeshivas must end\\", the group said in a statement.Karen Matthews. January 17, 2019 \\"Lawsuit over amendment shielding some Jewish schools tossed\\". AP news Community response For many in the Haredi Jewish community, YAFFED is viewed negatively because it works outside of the religious community's power structure. Ami Magazine, an ultra-Orthodox weekly magazine published internationally, apologized for publishing a YAFFED advertisement.New York to investigate Haredi schools for lack of secular studies The Jerusalem Post, 29 July 2015 The Jewish Week reported that the major Haredi umbrella organizations, as well as some local yeshivas, have declined to comment on the issue. The paper interviewed local community members in support of the organization's efforts, but those interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of community backlash. The members in the Hasidic community have publicly responded to YAFFED by outlining their concerns over the effects on religious Jewish education by government intervention. Additionally, community members expressed concern over additional costs being placed on yeshivas and parents, and have pointed to failings of the public school system, rather than yeshiva education requirements, as being more of a concern for government. YAFFED has responded by pointing out the degree to which critics agree that the lack of secular education in Hasidic schools is seriously challenging the funding argument.

Scenic trails were developed by Brookfield Renewable Power and the Town of Trenton.  Trails  Trenton Falls in 1873 The scenic trails consist of the primary trail (stone dust), which leads tourists to the Trenton Falls Hydro Dam overlook, and the secondary trails (wood mulch), which leads tourists along the gorge. Near the dam, there is a collection of rocks in the water that are accessible to visitors by a winding trail which leads from the adjacent bridge. This specific part of Trenton Falls attracts swimmers, anglers, and photographers.  Geology  The limestone in Trenton Falls contains fossils, and some locals sell them to visitors. The fossils include: Concularia (an ancient ‚Äúarmored‚Äù jellyfish), echinoderms (spiny-skinned creatures including starfish and crinoids, or sea stars), cephalopods (shelled mollusks with squid-like tentacles), gastropods (snails), and bryozoans (tiny moss animals).\\" Trenton Falls also has an abundance of limestone deposits. Since the late 19th century, limestone has contributed to the economy of upstate New York.  History  The Haudenosaunee called the falls Ka-na-ta-dork (\\"brown water\\") or Kuy-a-ho-ra (\\"slanting water\\"). In 1805, John Sherman was the first known non-indigenous person to see the falls. With funds from Joseph Bonaparte, a pathway to Trenton Falls was created. In 1822, Sherman and his collaborator, Jarvis Phelps, bought 60 acres of land from the Holland Land Company but in 1823 Phelps was bought out by Sherman and the Rural Resort was started. In 1825, the Rural Resort expanded to host overnight guests. While visiting, a tourist named Michael Moore fell into the gorge and acquired a crippling leg injury. Maria, Sherman's daughter, took care of him and In 1831, Moore and Maria were married and acquired the resort. In 1863, the United States Secretary of State, William H. Seward, held a meeting of diplomats at the Trenton Falls Hotel. \\"Once a vacation spot for the country's elite, the falls were all but closed to the public for 100 years by the various power companies that used the waterway to generate electricity.\\" Utica Electric Light & Power Company received Moore's Hotel and surrounding land in 1897. Because of the creation of hydroelectric powerhouse and the dam in 1899, the City of Utica, New York was able to receive electricity from Trenton Falls in 1901. Moores Hotel in 1876 After the infrastructure of the Trenton Falls Hotel failed, the building was destroyed in 1945. In 1950, Niagara Mohawk Power Company bought the hydropower plant. Reconstruction of the building was completed in 1984. Orion Power bought the Niagara Mohawk hydro facilities at Trenton Falls in 1999 and in 2002, Reliant Energy joined Orion Power. In 2004, Reliant Energy hydro facilities and Trenton Falls were bought by Brascan Power, known now as Brookfield Power.

He represented Harbour Grace in the Newfoundland House of Assembly for three terms, from 1898 to 1908, as a Liberal. Early life Oke was born 14 December 1857 in Harbour Grace, the grandson of Robert Oke, the first Chief Inspector, Newfoundland Lighthouse Service, and the son of Edward Langdon Oke, II (1825-1862) and Frances Walsh (1830-1881). His father was a harbor pilot, a lighthouse keeper on Harbour Grace Island in Conception Bay, and he became a local legend as the winning coxwain in the whaleboat race in 1859 that inspired the annual regatta in Harbour Grace. Oke was 4 y old and the youngest of four siblings when his father drowned with Nathaniel Snow (assistant lighthouse keeper) after they fell through the ice near Salvage Rock while traveling to the lighthouse in February 1862. Oke's mother, \\"Fanny\\", raised her young family by operating a variety store in town but was in poor health and remained an invalid for the last 19 y of her life. Newspaper career From the age of 13 or 14 y, Oke apprenticed as a printer with Robert Thomas Squarey, who had taken over as editor from William Squarey, of the Harbor Grace Standard and Conception Bay Advertiser. After three years, Oke was promoted to foreman. On 5 March 1873 the newspaper was purchased by Archibald Munn (1814-1877), who as publisher and editor, moved the business to Water Street East. After Munn's death, his son, John F. Munn ran the publishing business. Oke took over the positions of business manager and publisher and became part owner with Munn when the business changed to Munn & Oke, Ltd. on 23 May 1888. The newspaper title was shortened to Harbor Grace Standard. In March 1909, after Oke recused himself as an editor and publisher, Sophia Oke as trustee for their son Edward Langdon Oke, IV (1893-1966) or 'Ned' (a minor), and the estate of J. F. Munn became the publishers and proprietors of the Standard. At the time of Oke's death in 1923, Ned was the proprietor of the Standard. Although Ned was sole printer, publisher and Chief Editor, he filed an affidavit to retain the business registration and proprietorship as Munn & Oke, Ltd. After the newspaper ceased publication in 1936, the business relied on commercial printing and lithographic services, shepherded eventually by Ned's son, William Austin Oke, II (1930-2005). The \\"Washington\\" press equipment, manufactured by R. Hoe & Company, used to print the Standard, was still being used by Munn & Oke, Ltd. to print posters when Memorial University of Newfoundland purchased it in 1962 and named it \\"Pitcher Plant Press\\". Thus, three generations of Oke family hand-operated the historic iron printing press that was used in Newfoundland for more than a century (1850 to 1962). The press is on display in the Queen Elizabeth II Library (MUN, St. John's, NL). Political career Oke's entrance into politics was in the October 1897 Newfoundland general election, running as a liberal under William Whiteway, he won a seat from 1898 to 1900 in the 18th General Assembly of Newfoundland, led by the opposition Tory Party of James Spearman Winter (1845-1911). Oke continued as a member of The Liberal Party, then led by Sir Robert Bond (1857-1927) after the Newfoundland general election, held on 8 November 1900, and sat in the 19th General Assembly of Newfoundland, from 1901 to 1904. Oke succeeded again in election to the 20th General Assembly of Newfoundland and sat from 1905 to 1908. In 1907, Britain changed the structure of the self- governing British colony, conferring dominion status to Newfoundland by Royal Proclamation. At this time, minister of justice Edward Patrick Morris resigned from the cabinet and formed the Newfoundland People's Party, which ran against the liberals in the Newfoundland general election, held on 2 November 1908. Oke and five other candidates ran in a close election for the three Member House Assembly seats for the Harbour Grace District but he was unsuccessful in seeking a fourth term. Judicial career In 1905, Oke was appointed Justice of the Peace and Notary Public for the Colony. In February 1909, the Governor in Council appointed Oke to be Stipendiary Magistrate for the Northern District of Newfoundland and Judge of the Harbour Grace District Court in place of Alfred Henry Seymour (1855-1912), who was elected to represent Harbour Grace in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. Given this new position, Oke recused himself as a publisher. Until his death in 1923, Oke served as one of the two District Court judges in Newfoundland; the District Court in Harbour Grace was abolished in 1935. By 1913, Oke was appointed as a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, authorized to take affidavits for any cause pending in the Supreme Court and empowered to issue Original or Mesne Process. The Harbour Grace Court House where Judge Oke served is the oldest surviving public building in Newfoundland and one of the National Historic Sites of Canada. Community service Oke was a member of the Board of Education for the District of Harbor Grace, was president of the Harbor Grace Literary Institute for about seven years, and as an avid participant in cricket, football and other sports, he was an advocate for community athletics and served as a Trustee of Shannon Park (Harbour Grace, NL). During WWI, Oke was President of the local branch of the Newfoundland Patriotic Association (also called the Men's Patriotic Association). He was elected president of the Sons of England Benefit (or Benevolent) Society (Lodge Diamond Jubilee no. 236), which provided insurance benefits to members in need because of illness or other circumstances. Serving as Master of Lodge Harbor Grace, A.F. and A.M., Oke was the 3rd generation of Oke family in Newfoundland to participate in Freemasonry, a tradition passed down from family in England. His son Ned was a member of the Masonic fraternity for 45 years, where he followed in his father's footsteps, also serving as Master of Lodge Harbour Grace No. 476 A.F. & A.M. S.C., which met in the oldest wooden Masonic building in Canada (constructed circa 1867). Ned was also an officer of the District Grand Lodge and an honorary office bearer of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Oke was the Superintendent of the Church of England Sunday school in the west end of Harbour Grace and was a Select Vestryman and Lay Delegate of the Diocesan Synod for St. Paul's Anglican Church. Family On 31 July 1890, Oke married Sophia Lilla Snow (1862-1938), who from the age of 17 y was a school teacher in Harbour Grace. Sophia became the President of the Harbor Grace Branch of the Women's Patriotic Association of Newfoundland during World War I, was named an Officer in the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and was secretary of St. Paul's branch of the Church of England Association (Harbour Grace, NL). They raised two children. Oke's daughter Annie Gladys Oke (1891-1974) married the Rev. Gordon Stewart Templeton (1885-1969), the rector of St. Paul's Anglican Church (Harbour Grace, NL). In 1934, Templeton became Anglican Rector of the Parish of the Bay of Islands. Oke's son, Edward Langdon Oke, ‚ÄúNed‚Äù, (1893-1966) married Jessica Beatrice Sheppard (1901-1995). He was a sergeant with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in WW1 and was active in The Great War Veterans Association, organized the Harbor Grace branch of The Canadian Legion of the British Empire Services League, now the Royal Canadian Legion. Ned lent pilot Capt. J. Erroll Boyd (1891-1960) his Webley & Scott flare pistol to carry during the first flight by a Canadian from North America to England, 9‚Äì10 October 1930, in the Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by the American, Lieut. Harry Connor. This flight was also notable for transporting mail bearing a surcharged stamp as a commemorative overprint. The aviators had Ned's gun engraved to mark the historic flight and it resides in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum. Ned served as rector's warden of St. Paul's Church for more than a decade and was devoted to advancing community interests, dying in the home of Premier Joey Smallwood (1900‚Äì1991) during such a meeting. In 1890, Oke's older brother, John Langdon Oke (1854-1928), wed Mary Winifred Sheppard, whose father, Nathaniel Sheppard, was, like Oke's father, uncle and grandfather, a lighthouse keeper on Harbour Grace Island. John was a Harbour Grace Water Company Secretary and Collector who suggested the site for the first civil airport in North America (now the oldest surviving operational airstrip in Canada), from which aviators such as Amelia Earhart would embark from Harbour Grace, NL to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first pilots to use the airstrip, Edward F. Schlee (1887-1969) and William S. Brock (1895-1932), took off 26 August 1927 in the SM-1 NC857 monoplane, Pride of Detroit, attempting to set a speed record for round-the-world flight. In 1951, the early transatlantic flights from the Harbour Grace airfield were designated Events of National Historic Significance (Canada). In 1989, Oke's father, Edward Langdon Oke, II was inducted into the Harbour Grace Sports Hall of Fame as founder of the Harbour Grace Regatta, the second oldest continuous sporting event in North America.

Early life and education Taylan grew up in Hyde Park, New York and went to Franklin D. Roosevelt High School where his father taught as a science teacher. Taylan's inteterst in the history of World War II began while still in high school. His grandfather, Carl R. Thien was a United States Army combat photographer with the 201st Counter Intelligence Corps, who served in New Guinea and the Philippines during World War II. It was his stories that inspired Taylan's first book, \\"No Place for a Picnic\\", an illustrated graphic novel which chronicled Thien's experiences during the war. The book was written and illustrated by Taylan. After publication, the book received high praise, including placement in the prestigious selection list for the New York Public Library where it went on to become a feature book in 1996. After high school, Taylan studied Electronic Media, Arts, and Communications at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Pacific Wrecks Pacific Wreck Database began as a repository of known World War II wreck sites and was an extension of a project Taylan started while in his senior year at Rensselaer. In its first year, the site received over one million hits and has become recognized internationally as an historical entity. Since it began in 1995, the site has become a vastly growing community of participants and collaborators of veterans and enthusiasts. Taylan has been credited in the identification on wrecks as well as discovering new wreck sites and returning personal artifacts to family. Taylan has repeatedly travelled to the South Pacific since he first went with his grandfather when he was 16. Since then, he has visited hundreds of battlefields, shipwrecks and crash sites in various parts of the Pacific to add to his ever-growing database. In 2003, Taylan was credited with the discovery of a Japanese Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero in the Owen Stanley Range of New Guinea and helped with the Japanese government to recover the pilot's remains. Taylan believes his website can help resolve some of the war's 74,000 MIA cases, of which 48,000 were from the Pacific Theater. Taylan is an outspoken advocate of the protection of these historic sites, and actively discourages illegal salvage or destruction of these priceless relics. For his work to preserve the legacy of the World War II genereration, Taylan was recognized by the World War II Veterans Committee with the Hunter Scott Achievement Award. Solomon Islands Controversy On November 6, 2006, Taylan and his Pacific Wrecks crew sailed into the Solomon Islands to explore Guadalcanal Campaign battlefield sites. The team inadvertently stumbled onto a salvage operation underway at Ballale Island which housed a Japanese air base during the war. When the group went to inform the Solomon Island Royal Police of what they believed to be an illegal salvage operation, their passports were confiscated and they were confined to their boat and charged with entering the country illegally. Taylan and his crew were under boat arrest for six weeks to await trial. On December 17, Taylan and his colleagues were found guilty and each paid a fine of 800 Solomon Islands Dollar ($108 USD).

Two different companies independently developed and released the game: Nakamura Manufacturing Co. (initially as Torpedo Launcher) and Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Masaya Nakamura claims it to be the first arcade game he built, with his company claiming a release in Japan as early as 1965. Sega's version of Periscope is the company's first produced arcade game, released in Japan in 1966. Periscope popularized the cost per play of arcade games in the United States. Its success surprised Sega, leading to Sega's further manufacture of eight to ten new arcade games a year for the next few years. Periscope performed well in locations that would not have normally hosted coin-operated machines at the time, such as malls and department stores. The game's success has been referred to as a turning point in the industry. Gameplay Periscope is a shooting gallery game, simulating a submarine attacking warships. It is designed with a backdrop representing the ocean, upon which cardboard cutouts of ships hanging from chains are moved horizontally. Players look through a periscope to direct and fire torpedoes, which are represented by lines of colored lights and by electronic sound effects. Each play has five torpedoes that can be launched. One cabinet model supports up to three players and one supports one player. History =Development= In a 1977 interview, Masaya Nakamura of Nakamura Manufacturing Co., later known as Namco, claimed that Periscope is the first amusement device that he built. Namco states that its Japanese release of the game was in 1965. Initially known as Torpedo Launcher, the game is featured as Periscope in the April 1967 issue of Cashbox, with Nakamura offering direct import assistance to distributors. It has been speculated that the original version built by Namco may have been a custom model for department store rooftops, a year prior to the mass-produced model. It has also been speculated that Namco may have licensed the game to Sega; Nakamura stated that he did sell some of his games to competitors. According to former Sega CEO David Rosen, poor conditions in the US coin-op manufacturing market prompted the company's development of electromechanical games. His company, Rosen Enterprises, had just merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan to form Sega Enterprises, Ltd. the previous year, and both companies had engineers on staff. Rosen sketched out the design of Periscope personally. Released in 1966, Sega's original release of the game is a three-player cabinet. Its original price per play of is twice the price of earlier games. As the latest in the well-received genre of torpedo shooter games, Sega demonstrated it alongside such competition as slot machines, slot racing games, and pinball games at the 23rd London Amusement Trades Exhibition (A.T.E.) show in December and at the Hotel Equipment Exhibition in Paris in October 1967. The popular three-player cabinet drew in Fr500 (approximately then and ) per day at the Paris show, which was sparsely attended. At the time, Periscopes large cabinet was cost-prohibitive for international export, but its popularity among distributors flying in to see the game prompted Sega to develop a smaller model for the worldwide market. =Release= Prototype location testing of a new, smaller single-player version of Periscope occurred in Asia and Europe, and distributors were still enthusiastic about its performance, according to Rosen. In full production by March 1968 and distributed internationally, the smaller single-player cabinet measures deep and more than wide, which is still larger and heavier than most games of the time. Furthermore, Japan's high export tax made it more expensive than most coin-op games at the time, costing distributors () per single-player cabinet while the average game cost $695-795. Enthusiastic distributors complained of the expensive but popular machine's overall low profit, so Sega suggested charging a premium price of 25 cents per play (). Reception and legacy Periscope became a surprise success for Sega. It performed well in larger locations such as malls and department stores, which normally did not host coin-operated arcade games, but became a preferred location due to the machine's size and impracticality at a streetside location. As a result of Periscopes success, Sega created between eight and ten games a year for the next two years, and exported all of them. The game was successful in Japan, and then in the US and Europe. The game's success helped to set the trend of a quarter dollar coin per play for premium games, which became the US market standard for all arcade games since then. According to Rosen, \\"If you talk to the old timers in the industry, they will tell you that The Periscope was a turning point in the industry.\\" He said Periscope showed Sega it \\"could design acceptable games\\" and prompted the company's business of designing and exporting original games, including to the United States. Sega upgraded its subsequent game development to utilize the latest technology, with Rosen mentioning, \\"We were doing lots of things that hadn't been done before, like adding sound and special effects.\\" Periscope also sparked competition from traditional Chicago arcade manufacturers. The success of Periscope led to American distributors turning to Japan for new arcade games, which in turn encouraged competition from Chicago manufacturers. The game's periscope viewer cabinet design was later adopted by several arcade video games, including Midway's Sea Wolf (1976) and Atari's Battlezone (1980). Retrospectively, Ken Horowitz praised Periscopes impressive features for its time and points out its importance in Sega's history. According to Horowitz, \\"Large, bulky, and loud, it was an amazing sight to behold for the first time. Periscope attracted a great deal of attention from customers, but it also made waves with distributors, and it was incredibly successful for Sega. It may not be widely discussed today, but most Sega fans are aware of Periscope and the role it played in Sega's history.\\" Luke Plunkett of Kotaku stated that Periscope \\"set Sega on a path of electronic arcade gaming it's still on to this day\\". According to Eddie Adlum, publisher of RePlay, \\"People came into these arcades just to play that game. I would say that in my time, Periscope is one of the great successful novelty machines.\\" See also * SubRoc-3D (1982), Sega's arcade video game with a submarine periscope Notes References Category:Games and sports introduced in 1966 Category:Arcade games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Namco arcade games Category:Submarine simulation video games Category:1966 in Japan ","title":"Periscope (arcade game)"},{"id":"44570483","text":"The Nudariina are a subtribe of lichen moths in the family Erebidae.

Roy Wheeler (November 14, 1904‚ÄìFebruary 1978) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the Mayor of Linden, New Jersey. Biography He served as Mayor of Linden from 1952 to 1954, and on the Union County Tax Board. He was the Democratic nominee for State Senator in 1959 and came within 557 votes of defeating the Republican incumbent, Robert C. Crane. Crane died in 1962, and with the State Senate evenly divided at ten Republicans and ten Democrats, the Special Election would determine control of the upper house. Wheeler again ran for the Senate, this time against Republican Assemblyman Nelson Stamler, who won statewide fame in the 1940s and 1950s as a racket- busting prosecutor who waged a war on illegal gambling. H.Roy Wheeler during his term as the Mayor of Linden, NJ. (1952) Because control of the Senate was at stake, the race between Wheeler and Stamler attracted considerable attention from statewide officials. Richard J. Hughes, who was in his first year as governor, became heavily invested in the campaign. With a Democratic- controlled State Assembly, Hughes needed control of the Senate to advance his legislative agenda. Senate Republicans had a rule, known as the Caucus System, that no bill could advance to the floor for a vote unless a majority of the majority caucus supported it. Democrats had advocated a rule change. Both of New Jersey's United States Senators, Republican Clifford P. Case and Democrat Harrison A. Williams, campaigned actively for their party's Senate candidates. Case and Williams were both from Union County. In October, Hughes accused Stamler of raising money from the New Jersey Homebuilders Association, which opposed the expansion of anti-discrimination housing laws. Stamler had attended a fundraiser at the Short Hills home of a prominent builder, Louis R. Barba. Stamler said that the New Jersey Democratic State Committee had also solicited funds from the Homebuilders Association. Wheeler sought to make Civil Rights an issue in his legislative race, saying that Stamler was an opponent of Civil Rights and that the Caucus System served to block Civil Rights legislation. Stamler said that he was the sponsor of a bill that advocated fair housing in the State Assembly. The New York Times noted the highly negative tone of the Senate race: \\"The campaign has veered sharply in the last two weeks into a vitriolic struggle with attempts at character assassination overshadowing all other issues.\\" The race turned out to be not all that close, with Stamler winning by 7,230 votes, 96,171 to 88,941 (52%-48%).

Sailing Aarhus was founded in 1999 by initiative of the five yacht clubs in Aarhus, Denmark: Kal√∏vig Yacht Club, Eg√• Yacht Club, Aarhus Yacht Club, Yacht Club Bugten and Marselisborg Yacht Club and the City of Aarhus (Sport Aarhus Events) and the Danish Sailing Association. The first comprehensive project was to prepare and complete a bidding campaign for the ISAF Sailing World Championships 2003 in Aarhus (The World Championship for all Olympic classes). Aarhus did not win the bidding round but was outmatched by Cadiz, Spain but in 2014 it was awarded the world championship in 2018 for all 10 olympic class. The organization has an extensive network in business and the world of yachting and has close relations to the City of Aarhus within the fields of education, development and environmental research as well as a number of additional authorities and organizations. Sailing Aarhus has a performance contract with The City of Aarhus to attract and host international sailing events and the association is cooperating with the City of Aarhus, the Danish Sailing Association and Team Denmark to manage the ‚ÄúDanish Olympic Elite Training Center‚Äù ‚Äì also called Team Denmark Kraftcenter Aarhus. In 2014 the A.P. M√∏ller Foundation donated DKK 36 million to the construction of Aarhus Internationale Sejlsportscenter on Aarhus Docklands, which will become the new national watersports stadium.

The dam and Little Rock Reservoir are owned by the Palmdale Water District and Littlerock Creek Irrigation District and are used for agricultural and municipal water supply and flood control. The dam is high from foundation to crest and spans across the canyon, forming a reservoir with a capacity of . The reservoir has a surface area of and receives water from a drainage area of on the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains. A formerly popular recreation spot, the dam, reservoir, and vicinity used to receive about 300,000 visitors each year, but since 2015, the facilities have been closed to the public. Designed by John S. Eastwood, a noted engineer of several dams in the western U.S., Littlerock was built in 1924 by the Palmdale Irrigation District (now Palmdale Water District) to provide a water supply for orchards in the area. With a height of and holding of water, it was the tallest multiple-arch reinforced concrete dam in the world at the time. The dam's design combined with its record height was highly controversial; the state mandated renovations in 1932, in which concrete buttresses were added to the dam face. In 1938, the dam nearly failed as a result of historic flooding, which led to the evacuation of hundreds of people in downstream towns. The dam was renovated again in 1966 to comply with increasing safety standards and regional urban development. In the 1970s, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In 1994, the last major renovation of the dam was completed, which involved strengthening the face with roller-compacted concrete, hiding the original multiple-arch design and transforming it to resemble a conventional gravity dam. The arches are still visible on the back face of the dam when the water level in the reservoir is low. The design changes resulted in the dam being taken off the NRHP. The dam was also raised and a new spillway added, increasing the reservoir capacity to its current . The dam and reservoir are scheduled for a major renovation project in three separate phases. The first phase begins with construction of a subterranean grade control structure within Littlerock Reservoir at Rocky Point. The second phase is the removal of of accumulated sediment from within the reservoir over a seven- to twelve-year time frame. Finally, scheduled ongoing sediment removal of approximately per year to maintain design capacity. There are no plans to reopen its facilities to the public. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Little Rock Reservoir based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body.

He was born in Manhattan Beach, California, and worked as the National Finance Director for House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt for nine years. He was a fundraiser for Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and was nominated as Ambassador to Argentina in 2013, which was met with criticism. His appointment was filibustered by Senate Republicans, which was overcome by Senate Democrats. He resigned from office with a letter to the President on December 7, 2016, and left office as Ambassador on January 20, 2017. Early life and education Mamet was born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother in Manhattan Beach, California. He attended Mira Costa High School. In 1992, he graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Arts degree.Haaretz: \\"Obama fundraiser Noah Mamet appointed U.S. envoy to Argentina - Mamet, a fundraiser for Democratic causes, has been confirmed to the Argentinian envoy post, despite having never visited the country\\" December 3, 2014 Professional career At age 21, Mamet entered politics by working on the 1992 U.S. Senate primary bid by onetime U.S. Rep. Mel Levine. He also worked for the California Democratic Party helping with Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign in Santa Barbara County. From 1995 until 2003, Mamet worked for onetime U.S. Rep. Dick Gephardt while he was House Democratic leader as a senior advisor and national finance director. Mamet also worked on Gephardt's 2004 presidential bid. In 2004, he founded Noah Mamet and Associates, a business and political consulting firm with offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 2007, Mamet served on the international delegation for the National Democratic Institute to monitor elections in Sierra Leone. He also has served as an adviser to the Wasserman Family Foundation in Los Angeles. Mamet raised $3,200,000 for then President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.http://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/5-FY2014/F-2013-12853/DOC_0C05521180/C05521180.pdf He is a member of the National Jewish Democratic Council.Jewish Telegraph: \\"Dems fundraiser Noah Mamet confirmed as U.S. envoy to Argentina\\" December 3, 2014 Nomination as U.S. Ambassador to Argentina  On July 30, 2013, President Obama announced his intent to nominate Mamet to be the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina. This received criticism from certain political figures, who criticized the fact that Memet had never been to Argentina. On July 31, 2013, Obama formally nominated Mamet to the post. Mamet's nomination languished for months after his United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He speaks conversational Spanish. On June 24, 2014, the Senate's foreign relations committee voted to forward Mamet's nomination to the full Senate.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ntquery/z?nomis:113PN0113300: On November 20, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Mamet's nomination. On December 1, 2014, the U.S. Senate voted 50‚Äì36 for cloture on Mamet's nomination, thereby ending a Republican-led filibuster of his nomination. On December 2, 2014, the Senate confirmed Mamet in a 50‚Äì43 vote and he was sworn in on December 10, 2014. He arrived in Argentina on January 16, 2015, and presented his credentials that same day. Ambassador Mamet in Argentina As Ambassador, Mamet stated his desire to build connections between the US and Argentina through science, technology, energy and student exchange. In December 2015, the US Embassy in Argentina inaugurated its system of 72 solar panels, the first such installation at a U.S. Embassy worldwide. Also in 2015, the Fulbright Commission created the \\"Friends of Fulbright\\" scholarship program. The program gives Argentine undergraduate students a short-term opportunity to attend classes at an accredited U.S. university, and is designed for students who cannot afford the costs of an exchange program. After Mamet's resignation of his position, Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra presented Mamet with the Order of the Liberator General San Mart√≠n, the highest decoration of the Argentine Republic. In 2017, Mamet joined the advisory board of H Code Media, a digital advertising platform reaching US Hispanic consumers. Criticism After his appointment as U.S. ambassador to Argentina, Mamet was criticized for being part of a group of nominated \\"ambassadors that raised six-figure sums\\" for President Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, including by websites such as The Washington Examiner and The Huffington Post. In December 2013, BuzzFeed reported that Mamet's nomination as ambassador to Argentina was \\"met with surprise, and in some cases anger, by his peers in the donor class. Democratic Party donors complain privately that Mamet unfairly leveraged his clients' work for his own political gain and benefited from a close personal relationship with President Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina.\\" A group of retired United States Foreign Service officers have since called for an end to the practice of appointing political contributors and supporters as ambassadors. Mamet has also been criticized for lack of \\"major diplomatic experience\\" and not visiting Argentina prior to his nomination. In 2014, fifteen former presidents of the State Department Employees Union (AFSA) made an official request to reject Mamet's nomination to ambassadorship, which also included George Tsunis (for Norway) and Colleen Bell (for Hungary), because \\"they showed limited knowledge of the countries to which they'd been nominated\\" at their Senate committee hearings. AFSA issued a letter to the U.S. State Department urging it to \\"oppose granting of Senate consent to these three candidates.\\" The letter was the first of its kind, which set a new historical precedent to ambassadorial designations in the U.S. Personal Mamet has been a resident of Marina del Rey, California. He is not married and has no children.

His mother was naNgondo, junior wife to Gomani I, also known as Chatamthumba.  Early life  He was a descendant of Mputa and Chikuse, becoming paramount of the Maseko Ngoni of Ntcheu, southern Malawi, from 1921 to 1954. He was also one of the few leaders to have stood against the establishment of Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. After mastering the basics of reading and writing, Zitonga went to Henry Henderson Institute in Blantyre. He was baptised in 1921, the year he became chief, reviving the Maseko royal house.  Taking office  Under the Native Ordinance of 1933, Zitonga, now using the Christian name of Philip, was officially recognised as the paramount chief of Ntcheu district. Oct 27, 1926, he was guest of honour when people of the central Angoniland had built an obelisk, in memory of his father Gomani 1, who was killed by British colonialists. In the 1930s, when the colonial government introduced modern agriculture, Gomani II encouraged his people to adopt them, becoming a model chief.  Resistance to Federation, arrest and death  Totally opposed to the Federation of Nyasaland and Rhodesia, he was supposed to be part of the delegation of chiefs to London to oppose its institution. But because of poor health, his son Willard represented him. This delegation met some key figures in London including Reverend Michael Scott at the African Bureau and Cannon Collins of Christian Action. When the Federation was imposed in 1953, Gomani began to pursue resistance by ignoring official agricultural and conservation regulations. In response, the colonial government suspended and then withdrew its recognition as the paramount chief. In May 1953, the police tried to force Gomani out of the district but failed due to the thousands of people that had gathered at his house in Lizwe la Zulu (or Lizuli in short). In the midst of the chaos, Gomani and heir to his throne, Willard, together with Reverend Michael Scott, escaped into Mozambique where they hid near Villla Courtinho. Michael Scott was visiting the chief's court when this happened. They were arrested by Mozambican authorities and handed back to the authorities in Malawi. Scott was declared a prohibited immigrant and deported. His arrest was followed by a major disquiet throughout the colony. In June 1953, he was due to appear in the magistrate court in Zomba. He could not appear because he was sick, admitted at the Seventh Day Adventist hospital in Thyolo, southern Malawi. He died shortly, and was buried at Lizulu. His funeral was attended by thousands of people including the leading nationalists of the day. He was succeeded by his son Willard, who became Gomani III.

Holding a dual citizenship to compete internationally, Moskvina held the 2003 Belarusian senior title in her own division, picked up a total of seventeen medals in her career, including four from the European Championships, and represented her naturalized nation Belarus in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2004). Currently a permanent resident in Minsk and a naturalized Belarusian citizen, Moskvina trained under head coach and sensei Magomed Ramazanov for Dinamo. Moskvina made her official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where she competed in the women's extra-lightweight class (48 kg). She fell in a bodily shattering ippon defeat to Japanese judoka and reigning Olympic champion Ryoko Tamura during their opening match, but redeemed her chance for an Olympic medal by thwarting Honduras' Dora Maldonado and Italy's Giovanna Tortora in the repechage. Fighting against Algeria's Salima Souakri for a spot in the bronze medal final, Moskvina conceded with a chui penalty and a false attack, and lost the match by points and caution. Despite missing out the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney due to sustained injuries, Moskvina reached the pinnacle of her judo career by picking up two career medals at the European Championships in 2002 and 2003. The following year, she sought bid for her second Olympic stint with a sterling silver in the 48-kg division at the same tournament in Bucharest, losing the final match to Romania's Alina Dumitru by an ippon. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Moskvina qualified for her second Belarusian squad, as a 31-year-old veteran and a lone female judoka, in the women's extra-lightweight class (48 kg), by placing second and receiving a berth from the A-Tournament in Tallinn, Estonia. She opened her match with a swift exit from French judoka and eventual silver medalist Fr√©d√©rique Jossinet, who scored an effortless, fifteen-second ippon victory and pulverized her into the tatami with a sukui nage (scoop throw). In the repechage, Moskvina gained control to pin Australia's Sonya Chervonsky on the mat within a full minute, before succumbed to a waza-ari awasete ippon hold from China's Gao Feng in her subsequent match.

Set in rural Argentina, it tells the story of two young men from different social backgrounds coming to terms with their growing attraction for each other. Plot Mart√≠n (Mateo Chiarino), an orphan, arrives at his former hometown hoping to stay with his aunt after his grandmother had died. He finds out that his aunt had moved without leaving a forwarding address. With no place to stay and little money, he beds down behind the ruins of an abandoned building. He looks around for odd jobs and is eventually hired by the writer Eugenio (Manuel Vignau), a former childhood playmate. Mart√≠n does not want to admit that he is homeless, and lies to Eugenio that he is staying with his aunt. Eugenio eventually finds out about Mart√≠n's situation and convinces Mart√≠n to stay at his house for the summer. At first Eugenio does not seemingly remember much about Mart√≠n, but little by little they start to recall their shared memories as children. Eugenio realizes his growing attraction to Mart√≠n but is reluctant to pursue it, as he does not want to seem to be taking advantage of Mart√≠n's current financial situation. He is also afraid that even if the soft-spoken Mart√≠n might reciprocate his feelings, it might only be because Mart√≠n feels indebted to him. Mart√≠n himself is attracted to Eugenio, but he does not know if Eugenio is gay. And given his impoverished background, he does not want to presume on Eugenio's kindness. Nonetheless, Eugenio and Mart√≠n slowly grow closer together, and Eugenio finds it becoming increasingly difficult to hide his attraction. One day while moving some furniture, Eugenio accidentally knocks over some drawings of naked men from his desk. Mart√≠n sees the drawings, but Eugenio pointedly avoids talking about it. It dawns on Mart√≠n that Eugenio might be attracted to him. Mart√≠n confirms his suspicions when he sees Eugenio's flustered reaction after he deliberately strips in front of Eugenio one night with the excuse of doing laundry. Mart√≠n kisses Eugenio the next morning, confident that Eugenio is also attracted to him. But Eugenio unexpectedly rebuffs him, and Mart√≠n leaves confused. That afternoon, Eugenio discovers that Mart√≠n had packed up and left. He searches for him for several days but is unable to find him. Eugenio remembers Mart√≠n reminiscing about \\"dos anan√°s\\" (\\"two pineapples\\"). He realizes that Mart√≠n was talking about a picture from a Hawaii reel that they used to look at on a View-Master as children. He looks for the reel and the old View-Master and leaves them behind the abandoned building that Mart√≠n used to stay at. A few days later, Mart√≠n comes back, carrying the View-Master with him. They smile at each other and kiss. Cast *Manuel Vignau as Eugenio *Mateo Chiarino as Mart√≠n *Luz Palaz√≥n as the se√±ora *Antonia De Michelis as the neighbor *Manuel Mart√≠nez Sobrado as Eugenio's brother Production Hawaii was produced by a partnership between director and screenwriter Marco Berger and the musician/composer Pedro Irusta. It was funded through Kickstarter campaigns. The first campaign with a target budget of $40,000, ended unsuccessfully. The campaign was relaunched with a smaller target budget of $20,000. It successfully raised $27,000 allowing the shooting to continue. Berger describes Hawaii as a \\"Jane Austen contemporary story\\", noting that it evokes the same classic tale of two people from different social backgrounds and the dynamics between the powerful and the helpless. Screenings The film was an official selection at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema (BAFICI), the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival of the BFI London Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and films festivals in Barcelona, Seoul, Taipei, Copenhagen, and Berlin.

The case is the principal authority for the proposition that a company will not be able to make any claim against a director for breach of duty where the acts of the director have been ratified by the members of the company. Facts The plaintiff company (Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co) was a joint venture company formed between three shareholders to engage in trading, storing and shipping liquified natural gas. Originally the company was to have been incorporated in the United Kingdom, but after taking tax advice it was incorporated in Liberia instead, and a separate English company - Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd (referred to as \\"Services\\") in the judgment - was incorporated to act as broker and agent. The board of directors of the plaintiff company was composed of appointees from the three shareholders. Although the business was initially successful, it later collapsed with its liabilities exceeding the value of its assets by over GBP113 million. A liquidator was appointed, and began examining ways in which the company might seek to recover against third parties for the benefit of the creditors. The liquidator brought proceedings against Services alleging negligence in relation to the provision of financial information to the company. In the same action it also brought proceedings against each of its directors alleging negligence in failing to appreciate the obvious deficiency in information provided by services, and making highly speculative and negligent decisions which could not reasonably be regarded as coming within the \\"business judgment rule\\". Judgment Although the case is remembered primarily for the statements with respect to company law (referred to in both arguments and the judgment as the \\"company law point\\"), the actual decision that the Court of Appeal was required to make related to a procedural point on leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction under RSC Order 11 (now repealed). Because none of the directors were resident in the United Kingdom, and none of the acts complained of by the directors had occurred within the jurisdiction (all board meetings had occurred overseas for tax reasons), it was necessary to obtain the leave of the court to serve out. In order to do so, the plaintiff company needed to satisfy the court either that the acts complained of occurred within the jurisdiction (which the court disposed of rapidly), or that the defendants were a necessary and proper party to an action which was properly commenced against a defendant within the jurisdiction (Services). On this latter point most of the argument was focused. Services itself was insolvent and only had nominal assets. It was largely accepted (and may even have been conceded by counsel, it having been decided by Peter Gibson J at first instance) that the predominant reason for bringing a claim against Services at all was to use it as an \\"anchor defendant\\" to launch proceedings against the defendant directors. Lord Justice Lawton was content to dismiss the appeal and refuse to leave serve out on this basis alone,\\"This view of the case is enough to dispose of this appeal in favour of the defendants.\\" at 268F. but went on to consider the \\"company law point\\". In summary the company law point was whether the cause of action against the directors by the plaintiff company was bound to fail because the relevant acts had all been unanimously approved by the company's shareholders. If it was bound to fail on this basis, then it would not be treated as having been properly brought.The Brambo [1949] AC 326 Both Lawton LJ and Dillon LJ were satisfied that because the relevant acts which were complained of had been ratified by the shareholders of the plaintiff company, that they became the acts of the company itself, and accordingly the company could not later complain about them and bring an action in respect of them.\\"It follows, so it seems to me, that the plaintiff cannot now complain about what in law were its own acts.\\" per Lawton LJ at 269E; \\"If the company is bound by what was done when it was a going concern, then the liquidator is in no better position. He cannot sue the members because they owed no duty to the company as a separate entity and he cannot sue the directors because the decisions which he seeks to impugn were made by, and with the full assent of, the members.\\" per Dillon LJ at 290A. Lord Justice May dissented on this point.\\"If we assume for the purposes of this argument that the directors of the plaintiff did commit breaches of the duty of care that they owed that company, as a result of which it suffered damage, then I agree with the submissions made by Mr. Chadwick on behalf of the plaintiff that the company thereby acquired a cause of action against those directors in negligence. The fact that the members of the company knew of the acts constituting such breaches, and indeed knew that those acts were in breach of that duty, does not of itself in my opinion prevent them from constituting the tort of negligence against the company nor by itself release the directors from liability for it.\\" per May LJ at 280E-F. The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed earlier case law that the shareholders themselves owed no duty of care either to the company in whom they held shares, or to the creditors of that company. Vicarious liability The plaintiff has also argued that because the directors were nominated by the various shareholders, if the directors were liable then it followed that the shareholders should be vicariously liable. This point was not addressed at all by the Court of Appeal (even by May LJ who was prepared to accept that the directors might be properly liable in the assumed facts). Significance The case has been cited with approval on several occasions, including in Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd[2013] UKSC 34 and Re D'Jan of London Ltd.[1994] 1 BCLC 561 In Re D'Jan of London Ltd Hoffman LJ (sitting as an additional judge of first instance) clarified that it was not sufficient that the members of the company would have ratified the director's improper acts - it was also necessary that they must have done so. Shortly after the case was decided, the Insolvency Act 1986 was brought into force. Had that statute been in force at the relevant time the \\"company law point\\" would likely not have arisen, as the liquidator would have been able to bring proceedings against the directors in his own name for wrongful trading.

Origin and early life Krstiƒá was born in Latovo, near Makedonski Brod in the Poreƒçe region, at the time part of the Sanjak of Monastir, Ottoman Empire (present- day North Macedonia). His family hailed from nearby Trebino. His birth year is mostly given as 1855, and scarcely as 1840. He espoused a Serb identity. His teacher in Latovo was Obradoviƒá. Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78) and aftermath He volunteered in the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78). He then participated in the Kumanovo Uprising (January 20 ‚Äî May 20, 1878). After the war, the Serbian military government sent armament and aid to rebels in Kosovo and Macedonia. Christian rebel bands were formed all over the region. Many of those bands, privately funded and aided by the government, were established in Serbia and crossed into Ottoman territory. In that way, Micko Krstiƒá formed a rebel band in 1879 in Ni≈°, with the help of Nikola Ra≈°iƒá and the military government in Vranje. Micko's bands received weapons and ammunition in Vranje. It crossed the border and came into conflict with Ottomans in around Kriva Palanka, where many of his fighters were killed. With only one comrade, Micko went to Poreƒçe and joined the band of Stevan Petroviƒá‚ÄìPoreƒçanin, established in the same year. Brsjak Revolt On 14 October 1880, an uprising broke out in Poreƒçe, known as the Brsjak Revolt. Micko was one of the leaders, along with Ilija Delija, Rista Kostadinoviƒá, and Anƒëelko Tanaseviƒá., This uprising would span little more than a year. In springtime 1881, in the Devet Jugoviƒáa- inn in Vranje, Micko Krstiƒá assembled a band of 13 fighters, friends, blood- brothers and followers, left Serbia in springtime 1881. One of the members were ƒåakr-pa≈°a. Their first teacher and leader was ƒåerkez Ilija. In April 1881, the bands of ƒåerkez Ilija and Micko were surrounded near Kriva Palanka. The bands were devastated by a force of Ottoman soldiers and Albanians, with ƒåerkez Ilija and his band all dead, Micko and the survivors fled for safety. In the fight, half of Micko's band fell. Micko and the survivors crossed the mountains heading to Poreƒçe, while ƒåakr-pa≈°a stayed on the Kozjak. He had succeeded in leading the ƒçeta (rebel band) of Rista Kostadinoviƒá when Rista had died in battle. He was given Rista's gun which was ornamented with silver and nacre. He was suited with the red vojvoda mintan (under jacket) by tailors in Kiƒçevo in secrecy during the night. Serbia secretly and carefully aided the Christians in the Ottoman areas; in the Brsjak revolt, however, by the end of 1881, the aid was stopped by the intervention of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman army succeeded in suppressing the rebellion in the winter of 1880/1881, and many of the leaders were exiled. When the revolt had been suppressed in Demir-Hisar, Micko refused to give himself up. The Brsjak Revolt, and the preceding ones in Kumanovo, Kriva Palanka and Kratovo, had all a Serbian character, planned in the Serbian cause, thus, the unsuccessful outcome resulted in persecution of Serbs in the Macedonia region, with an increased Bulgarization of the region's Christian Slavic populace. Imprisonment Micko in traditional attire. Krstiƒá was imprisoned in 1882 by the Ottomans, and held in the Bitola prison. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. He wrote nine letters to the Serbian consulate in Bitola, Milojko Veselinoviƒá. During the Greco-Turkish War (1897), the Bulgarians granted amnesty to Bulgarians held in Ottoman prisons; Micko refused to identify as Bulgarian and stayed in jail. Finally, in 1901, the Serbian consulate managed to have him released, though he was under house arrest in Bitola, and was obliged to contact the town government every day. Meanwhile, the first Serbian guerilla bands were formed through self-organizing of Serb villages in Poreƒçe, Kumanovo and Kratovo provinces, which, along Veles, were exposed the most to Bulgarian violence. Krstiƒá's escape, on April 4, 1904, was organized by Savatije Milo≈°eviƒá, of the Bitola Consulate, Jovan ƒÜirkoviƒá-ƒÜifa, a secretary of Metropolitan Polikarp, Lazar Kujund≈æiƒá, manager of schools in Kiƒçevo, and Marko Ceriƒá. The presence of the Serbian bands were soon felt in the regions. Of the 40 villages in Poreƒçe, only one village, Lokvica, adhered to the Bulgarian Exarchate. Serbian Chetnik Organization Chetnik Du≈°an, Vojvoda Micko, Vojvoda Jovan Dovezenski, Chetnik Gligorije. Micko Krstiƒá was selected as the supreme vojvoda (commander) for Poreƒçe. The first success of the ƒçeta (band) of Vojvoda Micko came with the conflict against 8 combined Bulgarian bands led by Dame Gruev, who sought to violently return the Poreƒçe villages to the Bulgarian Exarchate and thereby strengthen the Bulgarian influence in those villages. The conflict took place near Slatine in Poreƒçe on October 5, 1904. The Bulgarian bands were resting in a ravine following clashes with the Ottoman army at Movnatac, located at the entrance of Poreƒçe. The Serbian Chetniks, numbering 40 fighters, silently surrounded them, and with a sudden raid, destroyed the five-times greater enemy. On that occasion, Bulgarian commander ƒêurƒçin and four Bulgarian fighters were killed, a large number were wounded, and the rest fled and scattered. Among the wounded were Gruev, who Micko captured. On the orders of Interior Minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Gruev was freed. He was escorted to the village of Solnje near Skopje, from where he travelled to Sofia. At the end of 1904, the old and exhausted Micko moved to Kragujevac, where he lived on the expenses of the Serbian Committee. Zafir Premƒçeviƒá was his assistant. In September 1909 the Turkish government issued a law on the suppression of rebels in Rumelia. Death He was assassinated in I≈æi≈°te, on the Brod‚ÄìKiƒçevo road on October 29, 1909.

Many times the body modification was used in ritual or ceremonial practices. It was also a crucial part of movement between major life stages. History The Aztecs were not the only group in Mesoamerica to practice extensive body modification. The Maya had a great history of body modification and arguably so did the Olmec and other major groups. Indeed, ritual practices that included many forms of body modification is key in the list of tenets that are cultural traits shared that make Mesoamerica a ‚Äúculture area‚Äù, an idea proposed by anthropologist Paul Kirchhoff.Evans, Susan, Toby. 2013. Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. 3rd Edition. It is possible that many of the ritual practices may have come from the ritual practice of autosacrifice, the practice of bloodletting on oneself. It had a potent tie to the shamanistic and religious beliefs of the Aztec. By drawing blood they appeased their primary god, Huitzilopochtli. Hard structure modifications =Skeletal= The cultures of Mesoamerica were well-known for making skeletal modifications and the Aztec certainly practiced these as well. The Florentine Codex speaks of a practice that the Aztec used in ritualistic ceremonies in which ‚Äúchildren were grabbed by the neck to make them grow tall‚Äù. This process may have caused changes in skeletal structure, due to stretched muscle attachments. =Cranial= Cranial modification was a procedure that occurred when an individual was still young, usually during infancy because the cranial bones are still soft at this stage and capable of morphing. An infant would be bound between padded boards to cause a tabular effect in the growth of the skull. Another method was to wind a band tightly around the head for an annular effect. Both of these methods produced an elongated shape of the head. This practice was seen as a desirable trait and often practiced in the upper classes; however it could be common on women in working positions because they would often carry children on their back for lengthy periods of time. =Dental= Teeth were another skeletal body part that was modified, usually by filing the tooth. Precious stones were often placed into bored holes in the teeth; some precious stones were jadeite, pyrite, or turquoise. This practice was most likely done when an individual was reaching young adulthood, as can be determined through the dating of the teeth found with these stones placed inside them. These alterations of the teeth most likely caused dental abscesses and possibly infection. Piercings Piercings are well represented both in documents and archaeological evidence. They may relate back to the autosacrifical ceremonies in which thorns or stingray spines would be drawn through the skin to cause bleeding for appeasement of the gods. =Ears= Ear piercings occurred among both males and females.Joyce, Rosemary. 2000. Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesoamerica. Austin, Texas. University of Texas Press. Children first had their ears pierced at an early age. Ears would often be pierced with a bone awl or a maguey spine then a string would be thread through them until they reached the age in which they could add ornaments to them. Ears would then be stretched systematically until they could hold the ear spools that were highly desired and given only to persons of a certain age as a show of maturation. =Lips= Boys that were intended to enter military positions had their lips pierced at a young age. These lip piercings would then later have an ornament placed in them and be systematically stretched as they took prisoners of war. The existence of lip plugs on full-grown male adults suggested that they had done well militarily and had a career in the military. This, of course, suggested that only males had lip plugs. =Labrets= Aztec men and women practiced labret piercing. The initial piercing, like ear and lip piercings, did not include the ornament being placed in the freshly pierced skin. Part of this was the ritual movement of becoming an adult in which ornamentation signified adulthood. Another reason was that it allowed for more bloodletting practices and appeasement of deities throughout this time. Skin modifications =Tattoos= Tattoos are less commonly found than skeletal modifications because of the lessened likelihood of preservation, there is documentary evidence to suggest that tattooing occurred with the Aztec. Ceramic seals have been found that may have been used to make an imprint on the skin before the tattoo was indelibly marked into the skin by the way of bone awls, maguey thorns, or other items. Guerrero, a Spanish explorer, also states that he received tattoos on his face after being acclimated to native life in Mexico. =Scarification= Scarification refers to the permanent and intentional marking of the skin causing scars. There are multiple ways it can be done, but the most common in use in Mesoamerica was scarring inflicted by a stingray spine. Scarification was relatively limited to the priestly caste in Aztec society. Instead of being given the lip piercing that denoted military profession, boys devoted to the religious life would receive scars on their chests and hips at the same age as boys receiving the lip piercing. =Branding= Branding refers to scars given intentionally through a source of heat, usually fire. The ‚Äúsingeing ceremony‚Äù was given to both Aztec boys and girls. It is uncertain of the age in which this ritual occurred. It was indicative of becoming one with the stars, as the burns on the wrists were aligned with certain constellations. A stick that had been placed in a fire would be pressed onto the skin of the child and the scar was thus given. It was an important body marking showing progression in age.

This vidyƒÅ or knowledge appears in the Chandogya Upanishad (Chapter V 3-10) and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (Chapter VI.2). It is one of the forty-one prescribed Vedic rirtuals. In Panchagni vidyƒÅ, which vidyƒÅ is a specific kind of knowledge, the symbolic agni (fire) is the object of meditation and has five important aspects ‚Äì the three worlds (the heaven, earth and intermediate space), man and woman; which vidyƒÅ is taught in connection with the \\"Doctrine of Transmigration of souls\\" as the \\"Doctrine of descent\\". This vidya was taught by the royal sage, PrƒÅvƒÅhana Jaivali, to Svetaketu, son of UddƒÅlka ƒÄruni. Panchagni vidyƒÅ belonged to the K≈õatriyas. UddƒÅlaka ƒÄruni was the first Brahmin to receive this knowledge. PravƒÅhana Jaivali, who was well- versed in udgitha, held that the Universe exhibits at every stage the principle of sacrifice in as much as the heaven by itself is a great altar in which the sun is burning as fuel from the oblation that is offered in this sacrifice, namely shraddhƒÅ, rises the Moon; looking at the sky again it is seen that parjanya is the great altar in which the year is burning as fuel from the oblation offered in this sacrifice, namely the Moon, rises Rain; then again the whole world is a great altar in which the earth burns as fuel from the oblation offered in this sacrifice, namely Rain, rises Food; man himself is a great altar in which the opened mouth is the fuel from the oblation offered in his sacrifice, namely Food, rises Seed; and finally woman herself is a great altar in which Seed being offered as an oblation, rises Man. This is his celebrated \\"Doctrine of the Five Fires\\". The Panchagni Vidya or the Knowledge of the 5 fires explains how the body is linked to the universe and why the mind‚Äôs true nature is to manifest its will in the universe. The Five Fires, called the Panchagnis, are not physical fires but meditation techniques. The Fire, here, is symbolic of a sacrifice which one performs through contemplation. Simplyhindu.com http://www.simplyhindu.com/panchagni- vidya The Chandogya Upanishad, which belongs to the Kauthuma ≈öƒÅkhƒÅ of the SƒÅma Veda, conceives the whole universal activity of creation as a kind of yajna ('sacrifice') where everything is connected; this sacrifice/knowledge is known as the Panchagni vidyƒÅ. The activity of creation (or of manifestation of any object) begins with the birth of the child (or with the production of an atom or molecule) whom the cosmos produces and not parents alone, then the child‚Äôs presence is felt everywhere mainly because the universe is intimately inter-connected. The ≈öƒÅstras teach that the macrocosm is in the microcosm; each manifestation is the quintessence of every particle of Prakrti, and that Prakrti on its own accord takes care of each manifestation or birth and withdraws those manifestations as a part of the operation of the universal laws. This is the philosophical background of this vidyƒÅ which deals all events of manifestation not merely as the birth of a human child alone, and which vidyƒÅ is the contemplation of the mind in perceiving the reality that is transcendent to the visible parts of the inner sacrifice. The subtle effects (all effects are only phenomenal) produced by all our actions are invisible to the eye, they are called apurva; we, as the causers of apurva, reap the fruits of all our actions; because higher realms are activated by our actions, with every stage of development being a sacrifice i.e. a meditation, the consequence of those actions become the cause of our descent. SwƒÅhƒÅnanda in his commentary on Sloka IX.80 of Panchadasi explains that knowledge once arisen cannot be prevented but meditation depends on the will of the meditator; and with regard to the conceptions for meditation (vij√±ƒÅ√±a), Badarayana clarifies:- :‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ö‡•ã‡§¶‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  :\\"Any (particular) conception (for meditation) imparted in all the Upanishads is the same on account of the sameness of the injunction etc.\\" (Brahma Sutras III.iii.1) Shankara in his commentary on this sutra explains that the sameness persists even when a difference of forms is in evidence, for instance, in some recensions the Upanishads speak about a sixth and entirely different fire in the context of the meditation on the five fires, whereas others have only five. He states that the materials and the deities determine the form or nature of the sacrifice, so also is to be known about the form of meditation determined by the object meditated on; for vij√±ƒÅ√±a is stamped according to the principle meditated on.

In 1991, he received the HCL Anderson Award from the Australian Library and Information Association.  Early life  Fred Derek Osmond Fielding, usually known as Derek Fielding, was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1929. After the early deaths of his parents, he was educated at the Masonic Orphan Boys' School in Dublin from 1939-1947. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1951 with a M.A. in modern history and political science. He went to work for Sheffield City libraries from 1951‚Äì1957, and would marry Audrey Reynolds in 1953.  Career  Fielding and his family migrated to Auckland, New Zealand in 1958 to be Deputy University Librarian at the University of Auckland. Following this appointment, they would travel to Perth, Western Australia to be Deputy University Librarian of the University of Western Australia from 1961‚Äì1965. The University of Queensland Library in Brisbane, Australia had been without a University Librarian for two years, after the resignation of Harrison Bryan. Fielding would take up the position of UQ James Forsyth University Librarian in 1965, and bring about tremendous growth in the library's collection. Under his management, the library went from 360,000 books to 1.5 million volumes. Smaller libraries were amalgamated. He oversaw the building of three new library buildings in 1974, 1976 and 1990 and the establishment of the clinical library at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. He sat on the University Senate from 1972-1983, and chaired a committee reporting on university organisation in 1982. He had the library collection recatalogued from 1968-1978 to the Library of Congress Classification system. As the university took on more students, and with the improvement in photocopying and electronic transmission of materials, Fielding became active in copyright law review. He worked with the Commonwealth Attorney-General's department and Australian Vice-Chancellor's Copyright Committee to develop guidelines for resolving the problems of copyright in an electronic age. He would publish articles in the Australian Library Journal and other ALIA papers and conferences. Fielding was Pro-Vice Chancellor, Academic Services, at the University from 1992-1994. He retired in 1992 and was made Librarian Emeritus. He died at his home in 2014.  Awards  In 1991 Fielding received the Australian Library and Information Association's HCL Anderson Award. In 1996 he was awarded an AM, Member of the Order of Australia.  Interests  An enthusiast of Rugby Union, Fielding sat on referee appointments committees in Brisbane. He was a volunteer radio announcer and committee member of Brisbane classical radio station, 4MBS. A strong believer in civil liberties and social issues from his youth, he was committed to ensuring that the censorship of libraries, both academic and public, was discouraged. This was particularly significant during the political era in which he guided the University library, under the then Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Fielding chaired the Library Association of Australia's Freedom to Read Committee from 1969-1974. He was President of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties from 1975-1979. His diplomatic skills enabled UQ to permit student protests on campus, including the all night sit-in in the Walter Harrison Law Library. He was also an observer for the QCCL during the 1971 Springboks Rugby Tour during apartheid protests.  Legacy  Fielding was survived by his wife, three sons and ten grandchildren.

Later he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant and served as Company Commissar in the Lincoln Brigade which was part of a volunteer based military organization known as the International Brigades who were dedicated to fighting fascism. He fought in the battles of Brunete, Villanueva, Pardillo and at Fuentes de Ebro. He returned to the United States on September 30, 1937 aboard the SS Normandie. = Later years= After returning to the United States, Ades was employed as an auditor with the Federal Housing Authority by 1940. Following his exposure by Congressman Del‚ÄôAssandro of Baltimore for being a Communist, he was forced to resign in 1941 and was placed on J. Edgar Hoover‚Äôs list for security detention in case of war. In 1941 New York State certified Ades as a Public Accountant and he practiced out of offices at 505 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. His clients included Our World magazine (published by his best friend John P. Davis), United Electrical Workers, the American Soviet Trading Organization (AMTORG), and the Communist Party of the United States of America as well as a slew of smaller left wing organizations. Active in the Bronx Reform Democrats Ades served as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention. He opposed the war in Vietnam, participated in the marches on Washington against it and helped start the Dump Johnson movement in the Bronx. In 1940, the FBI began their surveillance of Ades which only ceased when he entered Isabella House, a nursing home, in 1979. He died there and was buried in Baltimore Hebrew Congregation Cemetery, 2100 Belair Road, Maryland. = Personal = An early marriage was dissolved by divorce. In 1935 Ades married Mary Ethel Hechler, also a Communist Party devotee and had two daughters, Janet and Judith. Widowed in 1959 he married Dora Rubinfine Ziebel who predeceased him by four years.

Internal heat sources due to electric lighting, mechanical equipment, body heat, and solar radiation may offset the need for additional heating although the outdoor temperature may be below the thermostat set-point temperature. The building balance point temperature is the base temperature necessary to calculate heating degree day to anticipate the annual energy demand to heat a building. The balance point temperature is a consequence of building design and function rather than outdoor weather conditions. Internal and external heat gains and losses in a building. Mathematical definition The balance point temperature is mathematically defined as: Equation 1: '' Where: *tbalance is the balance point outdoor air temperature, given in ¬∞C (¬∞F). *tThermostat is the building thermostat set-point temperature, given in ¬∞C (¬∞F). *QIHG is the internal heat generation rate per unit floor area due to occupancy, electric lighting and mechanical equipment, given in W/m2 (Btu/s/ft2). This internal heat generation is not constant due to variability in occupancy, lighting, and equipment operation schedule but is largely considered constant to a first order approximation. *QSOL is the building heat gain per unit floor area due to solar radiation, given in W/m2 (Btu/s/ft2). This heat gain is not constant due to solar variability with time of day and year but is largely considered constant to a first order approximation. In winter, it is reasonable to assume QSOL=0. *Ubldg is the rate of heat transfer across the building envelope per degree temperature difference between outdoor and indoor temperature and per unit floor area, given in W/¬∞K/m2 (Btu/s/¬∞F/ft2). This heat transfer can vary due to variations of fresh air ventilation rate but is largely considered constant to a first order approximation. This equation is simplified by assuming steady state heat transfer between the building and the environment and only provides an approximate building balance point temperature. The 2013 ASHRAE Handbook ‚Äì Fundamentals, Chapter F18 provides more rigorous methodologies to calculate the heating loads in a nonresidential buildings. The ASHRAE heat balance method, for example, fully delineates the heat transfer through the inner and outer boundaries of the building wall by incorporating radiative (e.g. sun, indoor surfaces), convective (e.g. indoor and outdoor air), and conductive (e.g. inner to outer boundary) modes of heat transfer. Determination Methods An example of determining a building's balance point temperature using the energy signature method.In real-world scenarios, the balance point may be determined in one of two ways. In the energy signature method, a plot is created mapping electric energy consumption against mean outdoor temperature. The point on the chart at which weather independent and weather dependent electricity demand intersect is the balance point temperature. This method only works if large quantities of data on the building energy use are available, preferably on a daily resolution. In the performance line method multiple plots of electric energy consumption against heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) are created, using a range of balance point temperatures to calculate the degree days. Best-fit second-order polynomials of the form ' are then applied to the plots, which show various levels of curvature across the range of the data depending on the accuracy of the balance point temperature. In plots with overly high balance point temperatures the ' variable is positive, resulting in an upward curve, while plots with low balance point temperatures curve downward due to a negative ' variable. The plot in which ' is closest to zero represents the most accurate balance point temperature. This method may be applied to buildings in which the availability of energy use data is less granular, perhaps only available on a weekly or monthly basis. Building characteristics A building‚Äôs thermal characteristics may be described as either internally load dominated or envelope load dominated, each having a characteristic balance point temperature. Internally load dominated buildings have high internal heat gains from occupants, lighting and equipment. These buildings are usually compact with a low surface-area-to-volume ratio and many exterior walls in each room. The high internal heat gains allow the building to not be strongly affected by outdoor conditions. Large office spaces, schools and auditoriums are typical examples of internal load dominated buildings where the balance point temperature is around 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) Envelope load dominated buildings have significant heat loss through the building envelope. These buildings have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio with few exterior walls in each room. Outdoor conditions strongly affect these buildings due to a lack of internal heat gains. Residences, small office buildings and schools are typical examples of skin load dominated buildings where the balance point temperature is set around 15 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F). Solar gains can hamper internal load dominated buildings, contributing to overheating, while helping skin dominated buildings that lose heat due to poor envelope performance. Therefore, architects and building designers must strategically control solar gains based on the building characteristics. Degree days The concepts of degree days and balance point temperature are interconnected. By summing the differences between the balance point temperature and the outdoor temperature over a period of time, the resultant value is degree-time. Use of daily mean temperature data in the summation results in degree days, although degree hours or even degree minutes may be possible depending upon the granularity of the data used. The degree day is often further broken down into heating degree days (HDD), in which energy will need to be spent to heat the space, and cooling degree days (CDD), in which the space will need cooling (either through an input of energy or by natural means). This is achieved by counting any positive difference between the balance point temperature and the outdoor air temperature as HDD, and either discarding the remaining data or considering them to be CDD. Although degree days are calculated based on recorded energy use in the building, the balance point temperature of the building determines whether a building will annually have more HDD or CDD. A low balance point temperature (relative to the local climate) indicates that the building will be more likely to need additional cooling, while a high balance point temperature indicates that it is more likely to need heating. Ideally, a building should be designed such that the balance point temperature is as near as possible to the average outdoor temperature of the local climate, which will minimize both the CDD and HDD. Modeling Balance point temperature is frequently used in modeling as a base by which to calculate the energy demand of buildings due to various stressors. This is achieved by calculating HDD or CDD based on the balance point, and extending these results to estimate energy use. A sensitivity analysis can also be conducted based on the effects of changing the balance point temperature, which may demonstrate the effect on a model of altering internal loads or envelope conditions of a building.

The soap, produced by Indian media company Shree Venkatesh Films, was a remake of the popular Hindi television series Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon?, which aired on STAR Plus. It replaced the serial Tapur Tupur. It is a drama focusing on the couple Aranya Singha Roy (Yash Dasgupta) and Paakhi Ghosh Dastidar Singha Roy (Madhumita Sarkar).  Plot Pakhi Ghosh Dastidar, daughter of Sharat Ghosh Dastidar (Kushal Chakraborty) and Sumitra Ghosh Dastidar (Reshmi Sen), is a simple and traditional girl from Malda with deep- rooted family values. She believes in the strength of love, relationships, and has faith in God. On the other hand, Aranya Singha Roy is a rich, arrogant and suave business magnate with no belief in love or God. His closest emotional bond is with his sister Ananya (Debaparna Chakraborty). Pakhi and Aranya first meet at the Rajmahal Hotel where Pakhi accidentally falls from the stage into Aranya's arms. Aranya misunderstands it as intentional. He uploads the video of Pakhi falling into his arms on social media. This results in the divorce of Pakhi and her family faces great disrespect. They move to Kolkata from Malda, where they originally lived. Here, Pakhi gets a job in the ASR Group of Industries. As time passes, Pakhi causes problems in the office, which results in ASR (Pakhi's boss) insulting her. Anu meets Pakhi and assigns her to take care of Pamela, who is one of ASR's college friends. Pamela lives with them as she is going to be married to ASR. ASR feels disturbed with the presence of Pakhi in his home. Circumstances bring them close and they spend many romantic moments together. But, Krishnendu [Anu's husband] lusts for Pakhi and tries to marry Pakhi. Misunderstanding between ASR and Pakhi encourages her to agree to marry Krishnendu, leaving ASR heartbroken. However, Pakhi realizes the true intention of Krishnendu and breaks the alliance. ASR breaks off the engagement with Pamela, and reconcile with Pakhi. In parallel, Akki and Piu fall for each other but his mother, Pammi, does not want Piu as her daughter-in-law. ASR makes Pammi agree to their marriage. The plot introduces Harry, the nephew of Pammi, who begins to like Pakhi. Pakhi considers him a good friend but ASR begins to get jealous. Various romantic moments happen. On Akki and Piu's marriage day, ASR tries to propose Pakhi but does not succeed. Krishnendu plots against them and calls Pakhi on the roof. Following Pakhi, ASR also reaches the roof and sees Pakhi hugging Krishnendu. Though Krishnendu forcefully does that ASR misunderstands Pakhi and starts to hate her. Anu is found to be pregnant. ASR asks Pakhi to marry him as a deal which if she does not accept will lead to the cancellation of Akki and Piu's wedding. Pakhi agrees and is welcomed into the Singha Roy family. Weeks and months pass with Pakhi trying to find the reason for ASR's strange wedding proposal. When ASR reveals the reason, Pakhi tries to clear the misunderstanding but ASR is unwilling to understand. He is kidnapped by Krishnendu on his way to London. After a lot of hurdles, ASR and Pakhi succeed to expose Krishnendu and Pamela and reunite. They get married but find Krishnendu in front of them, to their surprise. ASR is shot and falls into the river; Pakhi goes mad. Harry and Gauri get married. =6 months leap= Krishnendu owns ASR's properties and Pakhi's condition worsens gradually. Radhe, ASR's lookalike is introduced in Udaygarh when the family visits. Radhe and his family members, Baisaa and Bijli (her daughter) come to the Singha Roy house. Pakhi is convinced that Radhe is ASR and fakes her intention of marrying Krishnendu, much to his happiness, when Radhe reveals that he is indeed ASR. Krishnendu is arrested and sent to jail. Now, Bijli comes in between ASR and Pakhi. A new character, Raj, is introduced who is trying to get revenge on the Singha Roy family because his father had left him and his mother for ASR's mother. However, misunderstanding is cleared and he leaves. Khushi, Pakhi's twin sister, is introduced and her fiance, Arnab. The show ends on a happy note with Khushi and Arnab getting married.

Contextual search services differ from current search engines based on traditional information retrieval that return lists of documents based on their relevance to the query. Rather, contextual search attempts to increase the precision of results based on how valuable they are to individual users.  Basic Contextual Search  The basic form of contextual search is the process of scanning the full-text of a query in order to understand what the user needs. Web search engines scan HTML pages for content and return an index rating based on how relevant the content is to the entered query. HTML pages that have a higher occurrence of query keywords within their content are not rated higher. Users have limited control over the context of their query based on the words they use to search with.Steve Lawrence. Context in Web Search, IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, Volume 23, Number 3, pp. 25, 2000. For example, users looking for the menu portion of a website can add ‚Äúmenu‚Äù to the end of their query to provide the search engine with context of what they need. The next step in contextualizing search is for the search service itself to request information that narrows down the results, such as Google asking for a time range to search within. Tuesday, May 12, 2020  Explicitly Supplied Context  Certain search services, including many Meta search engines, request individual contextual information from users to increase the precision of returned documents. Inquirus 2 is a Meta search engine that acts as a mediator between the user query and other search engines. When searching on Inquirus 2, users enter a query and specify constraints such as the information need category, maximum number of hits, and display formats.Steve Lawrence. Context in Web Search, IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, Volume 23, Number 3, pp. 27, 2000. For example, a user looking for research papers can specify documents with ‚Äúreferences‚Äù or ‚Äúabstracts‚Äù to be rated higher. If another user is searching for general information on the topic rather than research papers, they can specify the GenScore attribute to have a heavier weight.Steve Lawrence, C. Lee Giles. Inquirus, the NECI meta search engine Explicitly supplied context effectively increases the precision of results, however, these search services tend to suffer from poor user-experience. Learning the interface of programs like Inquirus can prove challenging for general users without knowledge of search metrics. Aspects of supplied context do appear on major search engines with better user-interaction such as Google and Bing. Google allows users to filter by type: Images, Maps, Shopping, News, Videos, Books, Flights, and Apps.https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/142143?hl=en, Filter your search results Google has an extensive list of search operators that allow users to explicitly limit results to fit their needs such as restricting certain file types or removing certain words.https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?rd=1, Search Operators Bing also uses a similar set of search operators to assist users in explicitly narrowing down the context of their queries. Bing allows users to search within a time range, by file type, by location, language, and more.http://www.howtogeek.com/106751/how-to-use-bings-advanced-search- operators-8-tips-for-better-searches/, Bing Tricks  Automatically Inferred Context  There are other systems being developed that are working on automatically inferring the context of user queries based on the content of other documents they view or edit. IBM's Watson Project aims to create a cognitive technology that dynamically learns as it processes user queries. When presented with a query Watson creates a hypothesis that is evaluated against its present bank of knowledge based on previous questions. As related terms and relevant documents are matched against the query, Watson's hypothesis is modified to reflect the new information provided through unstructured data based on information it has obtained in previous situations.http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is- watson.html, How Watson Works - IBM Watson's ability to build off previous knowledge allows queries to be automatically filtered for similar contexts in order to supply precise results. Major search services such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo also have a system of automatically inferring the context of particular user queries. Google tracks user's previous queries and selected results to further personalize results for those individuals. For example, if a user consistently searches for articles related to animals, wild animals, or animal care a search for \\"jaguar\\" would rank an article on jaguar cats higher than links to Jaguar Cars. Similar to Watson, search services strive to learn from users based on previous experiences to automatically provide context on current queries. Bing also provides automatic context for particular queries based on content of the query itself.

After Cressy announced that he would not run for reelection in the 1982 municipal election, Campbell and Barbara Hall competed for the Metro New Democratic Party endorsement to be its second candidate alongside David Reville in the Ward 7 race. Campbell won the endorsement. In the official election campaign, the strategy was that Reville was campaigning as the \\"senior alderman\\" candidate, who would receive more votes and thereby serve simultaneously as the ward's representative to Metro Toronto Council, while Campbell was the \\"junior\\" candidate who would serve only on the city council.\\"Results good news for Eggleton: Council tilts to conservatives as NDP loses support\\". The Globe and Mail, November 9, 1982. On election day, however, although both won the election it was Campbell, not Reville, who finished with the higher vote total and became the \\"senior\\" alderman.

The Globe and Mail, November 10, 1984. while the city was blocking the developer's application because it represented a significant loss to the city's supply of affordable housing. Although the developer sought and won an Ontario Superior Court decision ordering the city to issue the demolition permits, Campbell was one of 11 councillors, alongside Gilbert, Pantalone, Layton, Reville, Thomas, Rowlands, Dale Martin, Anne Johnston, Ron Kanter and Chris Korwin-Kuczynski, who walked out of council chambers to prevent the meeting from attaining quorum. Metro council The structure of Toronto's municipal government was revised in 1985.\\"Toronto Aldermen gearing up for first direct Metro election\\". Toronto Star, July 16, 1985. Under the new system, instead of the Metro Council seat going automatically to whichever city councillor had won more votes in the election, one person would be directly elected as a Metro councillor while the other would be elected as a city alderman. Although the Metro councillor would still sit on the city council, the change was accompanied with other structural changes to boost the power of the city aldermen, who had often seen their power and authority diminished by the perception that they were \\"junior\\" to the Metro councillors. In the 1985 municipal election, Campbell ran for and won re-election to the Metro seat, while Hall became the ward's city alderman.\\"Layton proved right\\". The Globe and Mail, November 13, 1985.

Toronto Star, November 26, 1985.

Toronto Star, December 19, 1986. and joined with Rowlands in a filibuster against a bill that would have allowed condominium conversion of existing rental housing units. She also worked to improve relations between the Toronto Police Service and the community, most notably by helping to establish an advisory committee on community-police relations in the economically disadvantaged Regent Park neighbourhood in her ward. In 1986, Campbell was one of the councillors who spearheaded a push to have the post of \\"alderman\\" renamed to a gender-neutral title.\\"Aldermen seek 'non-sexist' title for themselves\\".

The Globe and Mail, June 17, 1987. During her second council term, both the Ontario Liberal Party and the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party courted Campbell as a candidate, but she refused because her ideological affiliations remained with the New Democrats.

It begins in the shale oil fields of the Bakken formation in northwest North Dakota and continues through South Dakota and Iowa to an oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois. Together with the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka to Nederland, Texas, it forms the Bakken system. The $3.78 billion project was announced to the public in June 2014, and informational hearings for landowners took place between August 2014 and January 2015. Dakota Access, LLC, controlled by Energy Transfer Partners, started constructing the pipeline in June 2016. Phillips 66, and affiliates of Enbridge and Marathon Petroleum have minority interests in the pipeline. The pipeline was completed by April 2017 and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017. The pipeline became commercially operational on June 1, 2017. Protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline occurred at several places because of concerns about the pipeline's impact on the environment and to sites sacred to Native Americans. Indigenous nations around the country opposed the pipeline, along with the Sioux tribal nations. In North Dakota, next to and on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, nearly 15,000 people from around the world protested, staging a sit-in for months.  History  = Planning, 2014‚Äì2016 = Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851) boundary which Dave Archambault II invoked, opposing any pipeline construction within that area. Energy Transfer Partners approved and announced the pipeline project on June 25, 2014. In October 2014, Phillips 66 acquired 25% stake in the project. In September 2014, Dakota Access held an initial informational meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council. Informational meetings for South Dakota and Illinois landowners were held in October 2014, and starting on December 1, 2014, in each of the affected counties in Iowa. Meetings in Fort Madison, Sioux Center, Oskaloosa and Storm Lake brought out 200 to 350 people at each venue and in each one some attendees expressed their opposition to the pipeline. A webinar for Brown and Hancock County, Illinois took place in February 2015. On October 29, 2014, Dakota Access submitted the project to the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB), after Iowa Governor Terry Branstad rejected pleas from a coalition of Iowa community and environmental activists who asked him to block plans. In December 2014 Dakota Access submitted an application for a permit from the North Dakota Public Service Commission for the proposed route. In January 2015, Dakota Access filed the application with the IUB. In February 2015, it filed applications with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for sovereign land and floodplain permits. In April 2015, Iowa Senate Study Bill 1276 and House Study Bill 249 advanced with both Senator Robert Hogg, D-Cedar Rapids, and State Representative Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, in support; it required Dakota Access \\"to obtain voluntary easements from 75% of property owners along the route before eminent domain could be authorized\\". On November 12, 2015, the Iowa Utilities Board heard public testimony during one day with more than 275 people signed up opposing the pipeline. In January 2016, Dakota Access filed 23 condemnation suits in North Dakota \\"against 140 individuals, banks and a coal mine\\". The IUB approved the pipeline on March 10, 2016, on a vote of 3 to 0, being the last of four states utility regulators granting its approval under the conditions which include liability insurance of at least $25 million; guarantees that the parent companies of Dakota Access will pay for damages created by a pipeline leak or spill; a revised agricultural impact mitigation plan; a timeline for construction notices; modified condemnation easement forms; and a statement accepting the terms and condition's of the board's order.\\"Kim St. Onge IUB announces decision on oil pipeline KCCI, March 9, 2016 One day later, the company stated it had secured voluntary easements on 82% of the 1,295 affected Iowa land parcels.William Petroski Bakken pipeline secures 82 percent of Iowa land parcels Des Moines Register, March 11, 2016 A week later, Dakota Access filed motions with the IUB requesting expedited and confidential treatment to begin construction immediately, saying it met the conditions and that its liability insurance policies were trade secrets under Iowa law and \\"would serve no public purpose\\".William Petroski, Bakken pipeline firm seeks expedited construction permit Des Moines Register, March 17, 2016 = Construction, 2016‚Äì2017 = Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (2017) In March 2016, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service issued a sovereign lands construction permit. In late May 2016, the permit was temporarily revoked in three counties of Iowa, where the pipeline would cross the Big Sioux River and the Big Sioux Wildlife Management Area; these are historic and cultural sites of the Upper Sioux tribe, including graves in Lyon County. Also in May 2016, Iowa farmers filed lawsuits to prevent the state from using eminent domain to take their land. In July and August 2016, USACE approved the water crossing permits and issued all but one permission necessary for the pipeline construction. In June 2016, the IUB voted 2 to 1 (Libby Jacobs and Nick Wagner in favor and Chairwoman Geri Huser against) to allow construction on non-sovereign lands to continue. The Sierra Club said this action was illegal before the US Corps of Engineers authorized the project. In late June 2016, construction was allowed to resume in Lyon County after plans were changed to route the pipeline below the site using directional boring, instead of trenching and disturbing the soil on the surface. In December 2016, the approval was disputed in the Polk County District Court. On July 27, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the USACE in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On September 9, 2016, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the motion for preliminary injunction. On September 10, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an appeal which was denied on October 9, 2016. In August 2016, the joint venture of Enbridge (75%) and Marathon Petroleum (25%) agreed to purchase a 49% stake in Dakota Access, LLC for $2 billion. The deal was completed in February 2017 after the final easement was granted. In September 2016 the U.S Department of Justice received more than 33,000 petitions to review all permits and order a full review of the project's environmental effects. On September 9, 2016, the US Departments of Justice, Army, and Interior issued a joint statement to temporarily halt the project on federal land bordering or under the Lake Oahe reservoir. The US federal government asked the company for a \\"voluntary pause\\" on construction near the area until further study was done in the region extending 20 miles (32 km) around Lake Oahe. Energy Transfer Partners rejected the request and resumed construction. On September 13, 2016, chairman and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren said concerns about the pipeline's impact on the water supply were \\"unfounded\\", that \\"multiple archaeological studies conducted with state historic preservation offices found no sacred items along the route\\" and that the company would meet with officials in Washington \\"to understand their position and reiterate our commitment to bring the Dakota Access Pipeline into operation.\\" On November 1, 2016, President Obama announced his administration was monitoring the situation and had been in contact with the USACE to examine the possibility of rerouting the pipeline to avoid lands that Native Americans hold sacred. On November 14, 2016, the USACE announced that \\"the Army has determined that additional discussion and analysis are warranted in light of the history of the Great Sioux Nation's dispossessions of lands, the importance of Lake Oahe to the Tribe, our government-to-government relationship, and the statute governing easements through government property.\\" Energy Transfer Partners responded by criticizing the Obama administration for \\"political interference\\" and said that \\"further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered.\\" North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple criticized the decision saying the pipeline would be safe and that the decision was \\"long overdue\\". Craig Stevens, spokesman for the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now (MAIN) Coalition, called the Corps's announcement \\"yet another attempt at death by delay\\" and said the Obama administration \\"has chosen to further fan the flames of protest by more inaction.\\" North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said in a statement that the delay \\"will only prolong the disruption in the region caused by protests and make life difficult for everyone who lives and works in the area.\\" Speaking to CBS News in November, Kelcy Warren said that it would be \\"100 percent that the easement gets granted and the pipeline gets built\\" when newly elected President elect Donald Trump came into office on January 20, 2017. On December 4, 2016, the USACE announced, it would not grant an easement for the pipeline to be drilled under Lake Oahe and was undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), Jo-Ellen Darcy said that \\"the best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing\\". Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners issued a same-day response saying that the White House's directive \\"is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.\\" They said that the companies \\"fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way.\\" President Donald Trump signing the Presidential Memoranda to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. January 24th, 2017 On January 18, 2017, the USACE filed its formal Notice of Intent to conduct the Environmental Impact Statement process. The notice opened a thirty-day comment on the scope of the EIS, which concerns the crossing of Lake Oahe. The proposed EIS was to consider \\"Alternative locations for the pipeline crossing the Missouri River\\", direct and indirect risks and impacts of an oil spill on the lake, the Standing Rock Sioux's water supply, and their \\"water, treaty fishing, and hunting rights\\"; as well as their treaty rights to the lake. The same day U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied ETP's request to delay the EIS process. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump, in a move that stood in contrast to the actions of the Obama administration, signed a presidential memorandum to advance approval of pipeline construction, while stating his intention to \\"renegotiate some of the terms\\" of the pipeline bill. The order would expedite the environmental review that Trump described as an \\"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\\" These executive orders also outlined how the completion of the pipeline would create more jobs which is something that Trump and his administration believe is essential and important. They also feel as if the wages that people are being paid should be increased, another factor of the continued completion of the pipeline that the administration feels would be beneficial. On February 7, 2017, the USACE sent a notice of intent to the United States Congress to grant an easement under Lake Oahe 24 hours following notification of the delivery of the notification. On February 9, 2017, the Cheyenne River Sioux sued the easement decision, citing an 1851 treaty and interference with the religious practices of the tribe. Construction of the pipeline was completed by April 2017. = Operation = The first oil was delivered through the pipeline on May 14, 2017. On June 1, 2017, testing was completed and the pipeline became commercially operational. Near the central Illinois end of the pipeline, debate about the trade-off's between the environment, farm-life and the economy continued after the pipeline began operation. After the pipeline's first year of operation, Forbes reported that it was transporting over and had transported approximately of oil. A United States District Judge ruled in March 2020 that the government had not studied the pipeline's \\"effects on the quality of the human environment\\" enough, ordering the United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new environmental impact review. In July 2020, a District Court judge issued a ruling for the pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil pending a new environmental review. The temporary shutdown order was overturned by a U.S. appeals court on August 5, though the environmental review is expected to continue. Technical description The pipeline has a permanent easement of and a construction right-of-way of up to . The diameter pipeline is at least underground from the top of the pipe or below any drain tiles. The pipeline carries of crude oil. The capacity may be increased up to . At the length of and diameter of , the entire pipeline volume is . At the stated daily transport volume of , the discharge time to empty the whole pipeline is estimated at 11.4 days. The pipeline cost $3.78 billion, of which $1.4 billion was invested in the North Dakota portion, $820 million was invested in the South Dakota portion, $1.04 billion was invested in the Iowa portion, and $516 million was invested in the Illinois portion. The pipeline is estimated to have created 51 permanent jobs across the four states. In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners estimated that the pipeline would create between 12 and 15 permanent jobs and from 2,000 to 4,000 temporary jobs in Iowa. The $1.35 billion capital investment in Iowa was projected to generate $33 million sales tax in Iowa during construction and $30 million property tax in 2017. Energy Transfer hired \\"Strategic Economics Group\\" in West Des Moines to prepare this analysis. Comparison to rail transport Bakken Oil being shipped by rail in Trempealeau, Wisconsin, a few feet from the Mississippi River. The developer argued that the pipeline improves the overall safety to the public, would help the US to attain energy independence, and is a more reliable and safer method of transport to refineries than rail or road. Proponents have argued that the pipeline will free up railroads, which will allow farmers to ship more Midwest grain. About 70% of Bakken oil is transported by rail because of pipeline limitations. , Bakken shale oil was transported through nine Iowa counties exclusively via three freight trains per week. As of June 2014, 32 trains per week carrying Bakken oil traveled through Jo Daviess County in northwestern Illinois. From recent history, rail has had less spill volume per Billion-Ton-Miles than pipelines. Rail also offers greater flexibility and adaptability, but rail transportation costs significantly more than pipeline transportation. Both forms of transportation still require additional investment. Ownership The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer (36.4% stake), MarEn Bakken Company LLC, and Phillips 66 Partners. MarEn Bakken Company LLC is an entity owned by MPLX LP (an affiliate of Marathon Petroleum) and Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. Bakken Holdings Company and Phillips 66 also co-own another part of the Bakken system, the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline which runs from Patoka to storage terminals in Nederland, Texas.  Financing  The pipeline project cost $3.78 billion, of which $2.5 billion was financed by loans, while the rest of the capital was raised by the sale of ownership in Dakota Access, LLC to Enbridge and Marathon Petroleum. The loans were provided by a group of 17 banks, including Citibank, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO Capital, ING Bank, DNB ASA, ICBC, SMBC Nikko Securities and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. Due to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, the DNB ASA financial services group announced in November 2016 to use its position as a lender of over $342 million credit \\"to encourage a more constructive process to find solutions to the conflict that has arisen.\\" In February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted not to renew its contract with Wells Fargo \\"in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its \\"creation of millions of bogus accounts\\" and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve \\"social responsibility.\\" The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action, voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline In March 2017, ING sold its stake in the loan, while retaining a potential risk in case of non-payment under the loan. Thirteen of the 17 banks that financed the pipeline were signatories to the Equator Principles. Despite concerns being raised that the project could threaten the water supply from Lake Oahe and the Missouri River if a leak occurred, project financing was still approved.http://www.ethicalcorp.com/why-banks-need-plug-gaps-equator- principles-prevent-community- conflicthttps://investorsforhumanrights.org/events/webinar-equator-principles- iv-human-rights-perspective Route Map of Bakken wells in the Dakotas The pipeline route runs from the northwestern North Dakota Bakken and Three Forks sites. It starts in Stanley, North Dakota, and travels in a southeastward direction to end at the oil tank farm near Patoka, Illinois. It crosses 50 counties in four states. In North Dakota, the route traverses seven counties. The project consists of of oil-gathering pipelines and of larger transmission pipeline. The route starts with a terminal in the Stanley area and runs west with five more terminals in Ramberg Station, Epping, Trenton, Watford City and Johnsons Corner before becoming a transmission line going through Williston, the Watford City area, south of Bismarck, and crossing the Missouri River again north of Cannon Ball. It also includes six tank farm locations and one electric pump station. In the early stages of route planning, it was proposed laying the pipeline northeast of Bismarck, North Dakota. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) evaluated alternative routes as part of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, including one alternative route north of Bismarck, North Dakota. This alternative was determined not to be a viable alternative because of multiple factors, including that it was not co-located with other infrastructure, the route's impacts to wellhead water resources, constraints on the route from the North Dakota Public Service Commission's 500-foot residential buffer requirement and the route's additional impacts to areas identified as High Consequence areas under Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations. The Bismarck route was rejected by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) before submitting a request to the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) for a permit. This decision was described by some activists like Jesse Jackson as environmental racism. The change of the route put the pipeline into the existing pipeline corridor parallel to the already existing Northern Border Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline built in 1982. The Dakota Access pipeline selected a \\"nearly identical route\\" and planned to cross the Missouri River near the same point. The plans called for the pipeline to be directionally bored so that it would not come in contact with the Missouri River. It is planned to be \\"as deep as \\" below the riverbed. In South Dakota, the pipeline travels through 12 counties: Campbell, McPherson, Edmunds, Faulk and Spink. The system includes one electric pump station. Dakota Access Pipeline being built in central Iowa In Iowa, the pipeline extends about diagonally through 18 Iowa counties: Lyon, Sioux, O'Brien, Cherokee, Buena Vista Sac, Calhoun, Webster, Boone, Story (which will have a pumping station), Polk, Jasper, Mahaska Keokuk, Wapello, Jefferson, Van Buren, and Lee. The system includes one electric pump station. In Illinois, the route traverses 12 counties. Federal agencies permissions No federal agency has jurisdiction over the whole pipeline. The USACE has conducted a limited review of the route, involving an environmental assessment of river crossings and portions of the project related to specific permits, and issued a finding of no significant impact. It did not carry out an area-wide full environmental impact assessment of the entire effects of the overall project through the four states. The USACE was authorized to grant the following: * verification of Nationwide Permit #12 permits for 202 crossings of jurisdictional waters under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act; * permissions for consent to cross flowage easements acquired and administered by USACE at Lake Sakakawea and Carlyle Reservoir, under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, codified 33 U.S.C. Section 408 (Section 408) * permissions to modify the Oahe Dam/Lake Oahe project by granting easements to cross federal property administered by USACE for the flood control and navigation project, under Section 408; * permissions to cross the McGee Creek Levee, the Illinois River navigation channel and the Coon Run Levees, under Section 408; * permission to horizontally directionally drill under the Mississippi River navigation channel, under Section 408. On June 14, 2017, federal judge James Boasberg ruled that ‚Äúthe Court agrees that [the Army Corps of Engineers] did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the pipeline‚Äôs effects are likely to be highly controversial.‚Äù On March 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a full environmental review.Court sides with tribes in Dakota Access Pipeline case, ordering full environmental review Concerns = Health and environment = Cannonball River, North Dakota Conservation groups worry about safety, and the impacts on air, water, wildlife and farming, because of the risk of the pipeline disruption. Greenpeace and a group of more than 160 scientists dedicated to conservation and preservation of threatened natural resources and endangered species spoke out against the pipeline. The Science & Environmental Health Network also rejected the pipeline. Environmentalists and Native Americans accused the USACE of hastily approving each stage of the review process and ignoring federal regulations and established treaties with Native American tribes. They claimed there was a lack of environmental foresight and consideration. They expressed their fears that the Missouri River might become contaminated in the event of a spill or leak, jeopardizing a source of drinking and irrigation water that millions of people depend on for clean water. They claimed that the environmental review that was performed to analyze the impact of the pipeline on its surroundings was incomplete, claiming that even much smaller, less risky development projects require more rigorous impact analysis than has been completed for the Dakota Access Pipeline. The company responded that the pipeline goes underneath Lake Oahe below the surface and it has automated valves on each side of the lake. They also explained that the water outtake for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation will be downstream, and that contamination of the water supply is unlikely. It has been reported that the pipeline commercial operations started without oil spill response plan for the Missouri River crossing and without emergency response cleanup equipment stored nearby. Sunoco Logistics, the future operator of the pipeline, has spilled crude oil from its onshore pipelines more often since 2010 than any other US pipeline operator, with at least 203 leaks disclosed to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, with a total of of crude oil spilled. The Iowa Environmental Council stated it is \\"concerned whether the state has enough protections‚Äîfrom state government oversight to ensuring the company has enough money in reserve to address any harm caused by a spill\\". Iowa state laws require pipeline owners to have only a $250,000-reserve fund. Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement called the $250,000-reserve fund \\"fiscally irresponsible\\" and suggested raising it to at least $1 billion, indexed to inflation, which would match Alaska's precautions of protection. =Disturbance of land= Trenching to install drainage tile in Iowa during the 1980s. Some farmers are concerned about the disturbance of the land, tiling, soil erosion, and soil quality. Iowa fields contain a lot of drain tiles, which can be damaged. The pipeline company said they would repair any tile damaged during construction and place the pipeline 2 feet (.6 m) below drainage tiles. Some farmers were concerned about soil disturbance, but a Dakota Access spokesman noted that the soil had already been disturbed during the installation of drainage tile in all of the contested farms the pipeline planned to cross. During construction there is also concern for the spread of invasive weeds into the surrounding land. Both states (North and South Dakota) list Russian knapweed (Rhaponticum repens), Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and Saltceder (Tamarix chinensis) as invasive species of weed. However, under law the management of invasive weeds, once they are on private property, fall under the landowners responsibility. Farmers are also concerned about leaks in the pipeline caused by destabilization in certain areas prone to flooding, which could cause an environmental disaster. =Eminent domain= Highway sign objecting to the pipeline in Iowa Landowners across Iowa have expressed concern about the implications of allowing the state to use eminent domain to condemn privately owned land, particularly agricultural land, on behalf of a company that has not demonstrated any substantial public benefit to the residents of Iowa. In March 2015, a Des Moines Register poll found that while 57% of Iowans supported the Dakota Access Pipeline, 74% were opposed to the use of eminent domain condemnation on behalf of a private corporation. The Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club was \\"worried about the rights of landowners [...] concerned about [their] Dakota Access LLCs economic projections and whether there are really any benefits to Iowa.\\" For pipelines, eminent domain is most often invoked to grant a legal \\"right of way\\" easement for a certain tract of land with a parcel owned by a private landowner(s) as is necessary for the pipeline to pass through the parcels along its route. While many people believe the invocation of \\"eminent domain\\" inherently means land is being taken away completely from landowners, landowners do retain ownership of property affected by a pipeline right of way‚Äîhowever, those landowners lose certain rights to the portion of their property encumbered by the easement, including the right to freely use that portion of their property. Because US law requires landowners receive \\"just compensation\\" when eminent domain is invoked, landowners whose property rights are affected by the pipeline are compensated for the long-term use of their land, and they are paid for the loss of the current crop on farmland, replacement of fences, and re-seeding of grass.Sample of an actual right-of-way agreement; Pipeline Safety Trust. When a landowner voluntarily enters an easement agreement granting a right of way for the pipeline in exchange for compensation, the easement is called a voluntary easement. In August 2016, the company stated that it had already executed easement agreements with 99% of the landowners whose properties lie along the four-state route and, with regards to the landowners along the pipeline's route in Iowa, 99% had entered voluntary easements. The US Army Corps has given notice that they intend to grant the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline on February 7, 2017. This easement allows for construction of the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. =Tribal opposition= The Meskwaki tribe opposes the pipeline for numerous reasons; tribal chairwoman Judith Bender told the Iowa Utilities Board that she is concerned that the pipeline could be used as a replacement if the Keystone XL pipeline is not built. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have also stated their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that the pipeline and its construction threatens the tribe's \\"way of life, [their] water, people, and land\\". In September 2014, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II indicated the tribe's opposition to any pipeline within treaty boundaries encompassing \\"North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota.\\" The decision to reroute the pipeline closer to the reservation was described by Jesse Jackson and other critics as \\"environmental racism\\". Saying that \\"the Corps effectively wrote off the tribe's concerns and ignored the pipeline‚Äôs impacts to sacred sites and culturally important landscapes,\\" the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the USACE in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing the agency of violating the National Historic Preservation Act and other laws, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the pipeline. This claim was rejected by the court. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said in the ruling that the USACE \\"likely complied\\" with its obligation to consult the tribe and that the tribe \\"has not shown it will suffer injury that would be prevented by any injunction the Court could issue.\\" On September 20, 2016, Dave Archambault II addressed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, where he called \\"upon all parties to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\\" Citing the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, two treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate that recognize the Sioux's national sovereignty, Archambault told the Council that \\"the oil companies and the government of the United States have failed to respect our sovereign rights.\\" On September 22, 2016, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, a United Nations expert on the rights of indigenous peoples, admonished the U.S., saying, \\"The tribe was denied access to information and excluded from consultations at the planning stage of the project, and environmental assessments failed to disclose the presence and proximity of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.\\" She also responded to the rights of pipeline protesters, saying, \\"The U.S. authorities should fully protect and facilitate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly of indigenous peoples, which plays a key role in empowering their ability to claim other rights.\\" According to the statement by Alvaro Pop Ac, Chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, \\"the project was proposed and planned without any consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux or others that will be affected by this major project.\\" According to the USACE's data there had been 389 meetings with more than 55 tribes, including nine meetings with The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Kelcy Warren has stated that the company is not on any Native American property. In December 2016, Trump's Native American Coalition held a meeting where members, American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal leaders, and activists could be present to discuss a wide variety of topics that concerned the effects and implications of the pipeline construction as well as environmental protections and safety concerns. =Archaeological surveys= Several groups, including the Standing Rock Sioux and the Society for American Archaeology, have raised concerns over the thoroughness of archaeological surveys conducted along the pipeline's corridor. These surveys were carried out under the direction of the USACE, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA requires consideration of archaeological sites and traditional cultural properties. The initial survey showed 149 sites and the pipeline was subsequently moved to avoid 140 of them. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which oversees compliance with the NHPA, raised two primary concerns to the USACE about the surveys. They criticized the scope of the investigation, which defined each water crossing as a separate project, and therefore failed to consider the pipeline as a whole. They also criticized the lack of tribal involvement in the surveys. Tribal consultants help archaeologists identify sites that may be harder to see within the archaeological record, such as traditional cultural properties. A traditional cultural property is a property whose \\"significance derived from the role the property plays in a community‚Äôs historically rooted beliefs, customs, and practices.\\" The USACE reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux on several occasions for consultation, but were denied. The Sioux refused to participate unless they could consult on the whole pipeline. One instance of tribal consultation at Lake Oahe identified several cultural sites and a cemetery that the USACE previously failed to note. On September 2, 2016, Tim Mentz, a former historic preservation officer for the Standing Rock Sioux, testified in DC District Court that 27 graves and 82 sacred sites were to be disturbed by the Cannonball river section of the pipeline. That weekend this area was bulldozed. On September 21, 2016, 1,281 anthropologists, archaeologists, museum officials, and others signed and released a letter in support of the tribal community, calling for further study of the area to be affected by the pipeline in South Dakota. The Society for American Archaeologists also sent a letter to the USACE, detailing their organizations concerns over the project. According to the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, the areas highlighted by Tim Mentz were evaluated by state officials on both September 21 and October 20, 2016. They found that only four stone features would be directly impacted by the pipeline. However, many are still concerned about the cumulative effect the project may have on sites that lie outside the 150 ft corridor. Jon Eagle, a Historic Preservation Officer for the tribe, was invited to participate in the evaluation on Sept. 23, but was not allowed access to the areas of the corridor on private property. The tribe insists that evidence was destroyed by the construction company, as grading had gone on in the area previously. =Political ties= According to his federal disclosure forms, filed in May 2016, President Donald Trump held between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in Energy Transfer Partners - down from $500,000 to $1 million in 2015 - and between $100,000 and $250,000 in Phillips 66. This creates a conflict of interest when making presidential decisions affecting the pipeline project. The senior Democrat on the Public Resources Committee, Raul Grijalva, called this appearance of conflict of interest \\"disturbing\\". The Washington Post reported that Trump sold off his shares in Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016. Trump is also indirectly linked to the project because Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren contributed $103,000 to the Trump campaign. Trump has said that he supports the completion of the pipeline project. According to his transition team this position \\"has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.\\" A former staffer of Iowa Governor Terry Branstad re-election campaign, Susan Fenton, who is now the director of government affairs with the Des Moines public relations firm LS2, is handling public relations for Energy Transfer. Texas governor Rick Perry was member of the Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners boards of directors but resigned after Trump selected Perry as his nomination for Energy Secretary In December 2016. Kelcy Warren had contributed $6 million to Perry's 2016 Presidential campaign. A report by congressional investigators, released in 2018, showed that between 2015 and 2017, the Russian government's Internet Research Agency (a troll farm that was indicted following the Mueller investigation for its role in disrupting and influencing U.S. politics) used targeted posts on social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to inflame U.S. political discourse regarding energy policy and climate change. A Russian-controlled group called \\"Native Americans United\\" posted anti-Dakota Access Pipeline material. The report's findings were consistent with prior revelations regarding Russian disinformation efforts that aimed \\"to inflame other sensitive political issues ‚Äì and worked both sides ‚Äì on racial and religious matters, immigration policy and same-sex marriage\\" in the United States. Twitter told congressional investigators that about 4% of the Russian- produced tweets related to energy and climate. = Violence against Native people = The encroachment of the DAPL pipeline on the Standing Rock and other Indigenous communities has increased levels of crime in the affected areas. Rather than providing promised jobs, the pipeline companies set up camps for their own, itinerant workers that they move from site to site, (aka \\"Man Camps\\"), which bring high levels of sex-trafficking, drug and alcohol- related crimes, and other sexual violence against women and two-spirit people. Indigenous women have been on the frontline of the resistance against the pipeline, which has been referred to as \\"the black snake\\" in prophecy, and have organized protests including direct action, lockdowns, and prayer circles in the direct line of attempted construction. Some of these women are elders, and veterans of earlier protests, while others are young. Many of their actions have been met by police violence, such as the use of rubber bullets, strip searches, tear gas, and violent arrests of Native people. The people fighting against the pipeline see themselves as protectors of their culture, their community, the land and the water, and see it as their duty to stand against what they see as American settler colonialism. The United Nations defines human security as having two major components, freedom from fear and freedom from want. Human security can be threatened by indirect or structural threats. In North Dakota, the Man Camps created a structural threat when the oil fields brought hundreds of men to these areas and the crime rate went up 7.2%. Protests Standing Rock solidarity march in San Francisco, November 2016. Many Sioux tribes have said that the pipeline threatens the Tribe's environmental and economic well-being, and that it has damaged and destroyed sites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance. The tribe has expressed concern over leaks because the pipeline passes under Lake Oahe, which serves as a major source of water. Protests at pipeline construction sites in North Dakota began in the spring of 2016 and drew indigenous people, calling themselves water protectors and land defenders, from throughout North America as well as many other supporters, creating the largest gathering of Native Americans in the past hundred years. In April 2016, a Standing Rock Sioux elder established a camp near the Missouri River at the site of Sacred Stone Camp, located within the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline, and over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people. In July, ReZpect Our Water, a group of Native American youth, ran from Standing Rock in North Dakota to Washington, DC to raise awareness of what they perceive as a threat to their people's drinking water and that of everyone who relies on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers for drinking water and irrigation. While the protests drew international attention and were said to be \\"reshaping the national conversation for any environmental project that would cross the Native American land\\", there was limited mainstream media coverage of the events in the United States until early September. At that time, construction workers bulldozed a section of land that tribal historic preservation officers had documented as a historic, sacred site, and when protesters entered the area security workers used attack dogs, which bit at least five of the protesters. The incident was filmed and viewed by several million people on YouTube and other social media. In late October, armed soldiers and police with riot gear and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline's path. According to state and federal authorities, there were several cases of arson that damaged pipeline construction equipment in Iowa during 2016. One deliberately set fire caused nearly $1 million in damage to construction equipment in August in Jasper County, Iowa. Two other fires involving pipeline construction equipment were set around the same time in the same county and another was set in Mahaska County. In October, another arson fire caused $2 million worth of damage to pipeline construction equipment in Jasper County, Iowa. On November 15, protesters in Chicago, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Denver, and other cities held protests against the pipeline in a coordinated protest which organizers called a \\"National Day of Action\\". In January 2017, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum directing the USACE to expedite the project. After the USACE approved the final easement under Lake Oahe on February 9, allowing Dakota Access to complete the pipeline, the decision was challenged in a lawsuit by the Cheyenne River Sioux. Sacred Stone Camp was cleared by local law enforcement on February 22, 2017. In December 2016, it was reported that Dakota Access LLC had hired the firm TigerSwan to provide security during the protest. In May 2017, internal TigerSwan documents leaked to The Intercept and other documents obtained through public records requests revealed a close collaboration between the pipeline company and local, state, and federal law enforcement as they carried out \\"military-style counterterrorism measures\\" to suppress the protesters. TigerSwan also collected information used to assist prosecutors in building cases against protesters, and used social media in an attempt to sway public support for the pipeline. One of the released documents called the pipeline opposition movement \\"an ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component\\" that operated along a \\"jihadist insurgency model\\".

He started his career in the Scottish Football League with St Mirren before moving to England in 1955, where he played for several Football League clubs, including Southend United, Newcastle United, Scunthorpe United, Southampton and Swansea Town. Playing career McGuigan was born in Motherwell; his father had played football before the war with Motherwell. McGuigan played junior football for Muirkirk and Bo'ness United, before signing professionally with St Mirren in November 1953. In May 1955, he moved to England to join Southend United, where he stayed until June 1958, making 125 league appearances. He then moved to First Division Newcastle United for ¬£2,250 in an exchange deal with Bill Punton joining Southend. He made a scoring debut, with Newcastle's goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Everton on 30 August. At St James' Park, he was in and out of the side and was never able to show any consistent form, and after three and a half years was transferred to Scunthorpe United of the Football League Second Division in January 1962 in another exchange deal, with Barrie Thomas coming to Newcastle. McGuigan was valued at ¬£9,000, then a club record signing for Scunthorpe. Scunthorpe played Southampton five times in league and cup matches in the 1962‚Äì63 season and McGuigan played in each of them, scoring two goals in League Cup matches. He clearly made an impression on the Southampton manager Ted Bates who signed him in August 1963 for a fee of ¬£10,000.

The C.E.S.T.M's purpose is to help to preserve those species by leading scientific research, which tends to understand better their behaviour and thus contribute to their protection. The Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy supports the centre. Since 2008, the centre has been setting up a program of satellite monitoring of young Loggerhead sea turtles in real time by implanting an electronic chip in a flipper before releasing them. This program allows studying their moving in the Gascony gulf. The Aquarium of La Rochelle works on this project in partnership with Oceanopolis in Brest. =Marine Species Conservation and Studies Centre= The Aquarium of La Rochelle reproduces about twenty marine species and grows different type of corals in 150 quarantine aquariums, which thus avoids samples in natural environment.

Mais le succ√®s d' √âmilie jolie n'est pas li√© √† ces seules raisons : si ... Summary The narrator starts by telling the story of a goldfish, but suddenly realises that he is here to instead tell the story of √âmilie Jolie. While her parents were out, the young √âmilie is lying alone in her bed and frightened by the darkness. She finds a picture book on the floor and immerses herself in it. The first song, \\"Song of the Young Girl in the Empty Bedroom\\" starts. After the song, √âmilie finds herself in a landscape where everything was blue, even the sun. There, she crosses paths with the Blue Rabbits' Gathering, who were facing a problem; each time when it rains, they catch a cold. When they start sneezing, they become red. On the following page, √âmilie arrives in front of a giant tree with many birds and one of the birds comes to her. After introducing herself, √âmilie asks the bird to take her with it to the sky. The bird answers that there are still many things for her to discover on earth, leading into the song, \\"Song of √âmilie and the Great Bird.\\" On the next page, √âmilie meets an ostrich who is longing to be a cabaret star on Broadway. And so the ostrich sings \\"Ostrich's Song.\\" The little girl then enters into a dark and creepy page, the page of the witch. The witch feels doomed because of her situation where she appears as a mean person to all that she meets, but in fact, she is only waiting for a 'prince charming' to love and save her. This leads into the song, \\"Song of the Witch.\\" √âmilie promises the witch that she will look for the witch's 'prince charming' throughout the book, with the help of the narrator. √âmilie visits the page where she meets a ballet of umbrella ribs.In French, it's the same word to say ribs and whales. In the song, there is a play on words The umbrella ribs' song starts playing. She is then struck by an idea. She calls the blue rabbits and asks them to come to the page she is in. After they arrive, she announces that she has found a way for them not becoming red. They just need to hold onto the umbrellas when it rains. The song \\"The Blue Rabbits' Gathering Song\\" is sung again. On the next page, Emily meets a hedgehog who is sad because nobody wants to stroke him due to his quills. √âmilie, like the \\"book's fairy\\", decides to caress him to make him happy, leading into \\"Hedgehog's Song.\\" She continues on her way through the pages seeking the 'prince charming'. She meets an extraterrestrial who is crazy about the music in his spaceship (\\"Extraterrestrial's Song\\"); a pebble abandoned by Tom Thumb, which felt lonely in the forest and she picks it up so that it goes with her in her pocket (\\"Pebble's Song\\"); a cock and a donkey that have to share the book's words (\\"Cock and Donkey's Song\\"); a little flower who doesn't want to wilt under the leaves so she picks it up to put in her hair (\\"Sad Little Flower's Song\\") ‚Äì this song isn't in the first version.

Besides just being advised that he had just lost their business, the Liebherr Australia representative also informed them that they did not want to buy back any of the $800,000 in Liebherr parts that Ellison was contracted under the distribution agreement. The Liebherr AG representative thought this was unfair, and last got Liebherr Australia to agree to purchase the parts back at a \\"fair and reasonable\\" price. Liebherr Australia subsequently negotiations with Ellison to purchase their stock, but talks broke down after Liebherr wanted to offer less than cost price, as well as excluding from purchase much of the stock.

A less than impressed Ellison sued Liebherr under the agreement to purchase the stock, which Liebherr defended that they denied even making the offer to purchase, and if they did, they claimed that the term \\"fair and reasonable\\" lacked certainty and therefore made such a contract not legally enforceable.

He died in Voutenay-sur-Cure, Yonne of France. Early life Malan√ßon was born in Parisian middle-class family. His father was a banker, and Malancon was raised by his step-mother, Marie-Com√©lie Falcon, a well-known lyric tragedian under the July Monarchy (often indicated, indiscriminately, as his grandmother). He completed his secondary education at Louis-le-Grand, where he studied classic culture. At age twenty-three, he married Alice Josse on May 24, 1899. Their daughter Germaine married Gaston Bergery, an official close to the Left-Wing Coalition and the influential journalist Georges Boris, who would have an important role in the Resistance. Malan√ßon divorced on May 24, 1924 and, a year later, married painter Antoinette Destrem (1881 ‚Äì 1942). She died during the Second World War.  Painter  In 1904, after his military service, he joined the Julian Academy, where he learned painting. He stayed there for two years and become friendly with Yves Alix, Pierre Bompard, sculptor Vigoureux, Maurice Savin, Souverbie, Georges Braque, Dunoyer de Segonzac, Fr√©d√©ric Deshayes, La Fresnaye, Legueult and Andr√© Lhote. On Braque‚Äôs advice, he pursued his studies, from 1905 to 1914, in the Humbert Academy. After World War I, in which he was called up for military service, Malan√ßon began his painting career. He stayed in regions where landscapes served as a source of inspiration for him. He first chose Brittany and then Normandy. A watercolour painting of him showed Manlan√ßon and his wife painting Honfleur, while an oil painting by Malan√ßon showed Paul-Elie Gernez painting the famous Calvados Port. In 1930, he organised, in the Eug√®ne Druet gallery, a personal exposition of 25 paintings. Critic Louis Vauxcelles wrote in the 2 March 1930 Carnet de la Semaine, ‚ÄúMalan√ßon ‚Äì that I have appreciated for a long time and Segonzac, Moreau, Simon Levy, Gernez share my feeling ‚Äì is today at his best. This indecisive person in quest for himself for a long time, was frightened to death up to today. His consents, with a unique and precious harmony, the firmness of his construction, are of its own. Malan√ßon, indifferent to the success and congenitally unable to do the lower movement of pushiness, was like surprised, I will say stunned of the success best people give to him...‚Äù Malan√ßon often left Paris, where he lived at 80 Pierre-Demours street, to paint in C√©ret, Saint-Tropez, in Camac (where Bompart joined him), Pont-l'Abb√©, Saint-Paul-de-Vence and Gargilesse in Creuse. In 1934, the Malan√ßons discovered the V√©zelay's hill. This site became a favorite. They bought, in 1940, a house in Voutenay-sur-Cure, not far from V√©zelay, where they settled during the Nazi Occupation. Antoinette died in February 1942, asking her governess, Lucienne Sauterau, to take care of her husband. Affected by Antoinette‚Äôs death, Malan√ßon hardly painted during the 1940s. The war years war were marked by his activities in the French resistance, with Sautereau, in the network F2. From December 1944 to the Liberation of France, they accommodated underground an officer from the British Royal Air Force. Malan√ßon died on December 20, 1960.

A wind-driven walking machine. An eight-bar linkage is a one degree-of-freedom mechanism that is constructed from eight links and 10 joints. J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, Geometric Design of Linkages, 2nd Edition, Springer 2010 These linkages are rare compared to four-bar and six-bar linkages, but two well-known examples are the Peaucellier linkage and the linkage designed by Theo Jansen for his walking machines. Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage: bars of identical colour are of equal length Classification of eight-bar linkages Eight-bar linkages are classified by how many binary, ternary and quaternary links they have. A binary link connects two joints, a ternary link connects three joints and a quaternary link connects four joints. There are three classes of eight-bar linkage denoted (4, 4, 0, 0), (5, 2, 1, 0) and (6, 0, 2, 0), distinguished by the count of binary, ternary and quaternary links, when read from left to right---the final zero is traditionally added to the class label though no eight-bar linkage has a quintanary link.. There are sixteen different topologies of eight-bar linkages which are distinguished by their non-isomorphic linkage graphs. Of these 16 topologies, nine are in class (4, 4, 0, 0), five are in (5, 2, 1, 0) and two in (6, 0, 2, 0). The Peaucellier linkage The Peaucellier linkage (or Peaucellier-Lipkin cell, or Peaucellier-Lipkin Inversor) is an eight-bar linkage constructed from hinged joints that traces a pure straight line from a rotary input. It is named after Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier (1832-1913), a French army officer, and Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin (1846-1876), a Lithuanian Jew and son of the famed Rabbi Israel Salanter. This linkage clearly consists of eight bars when the ground frame is counted as a bar. The Chebychev‚ÄìGr√ºbler‚ÄìKutzbach criterion shows that an eight-bar linkage must have ten single degree-of-freedom joints, while the Peaucellier linkage appears to have only six hinged joints. This is resolved by noting that four of the hinged joints each connect three bars. This is considered to be a special case of two joints that are located in the same place. Thus, six plus four provides the 10 one degree-of-freedom joints. The Peaucellier linkage is a (4, 4, 0, 0) eight-bar linkage, which means four of the bars have two joints and four bars have three joints. Animation of one leg of Theo Jansen's Strandbeest The Jansen linkage The eight bars of the Jansen linkage, which include the ground frame, are readily identified, and include two triangular links. In this case only seven of the 10 hinged joints are readily identified. However, there are three joints that connect three links. The first is the end of the drive crank, the second is the other base pivot and the third is one side of the triangle that forms the lower leg. Separating these overlapping joints provides three additional joints so there are 10 single degree-of-freedom joints. The Jansen linkage is of type (5, 2, 1, 0), because the upper triangular link supports four joints, two of which overlap at the ground joint, the lower triangular link and the input crank connect three joints and are ternary links. The remaining five links, which includes the ground link, are binary links.

Characteristically worn by quartermasters and seamen in the French Navy, it has become a staple in civilian French fashion and, especially outside France, this kind of striped garment is often part of the stereotypical image of a French person.The ultimate symbol of french cool. bbc.com by Katya Foreman 9 March 2016 It is also known as a Breton shirt, as many sailors in the French Navy were from Brittany.  History  French sailor in uniform, early 20th century Regulations of 27 March 1858 introduced the blue-and-white marini√®re to the French Navy's official uniform for seamen, describing it thus: A genuine marini√®re has, front and back, twenty navy blue stripes each wide, spaced apart, and on the sleeves fourteen navy blue stripes spaced the same.There can be twenty-one on the body and fifteen on the sleeves for very tall sailors. Legend has it that each of the twenty-one represents one of Napoleon's victories. The three-quarter-length sleeves must be no longer than those of the overjacket, and the flared collar must reach the neck. The \\"\\" (\\"French Navy Standard Duty Blue Jersey\\") is part of Uniforms 22bis and 23. Sailors used to say that the stripes made it easier to see men who had fallen into the sea. Marini√®res were made by independent tailors, but eventually were made in navy workshops; army tailoring was a separate duty, often performed by conscripts. Marini√®res became a large product in France, manufactured by companies such as Saint James, Armor Lux and Orcival.  Fashion  Gabrielle Chanel, in the interwar period Although it originated in the Navy, the marini√®re has been an important fashion item ever since. During the First World War, Coco Chanel regularly took seaside holidays and was inspired by the local sailors' uniforms. At her second shop in Deauville she launched the \\"Navy Style\\", a short marini√®re. In doing so she continued the emancipation of women's bodies and the \\"practical\\" side of her creations, by using simple jersey fabric during times of privation. Her marini√®res became widespread luxury items. Years later, Karl Lagerfield paid homage to House of Chanel by regularly recreating the marini√®re for his fashion shows, especially in his ready-to-wear summer collection \\"Croisi√®re\\". In the 1940s the marini√®re was worn by John Wayne, then Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Brigitte Bardot, Marcel Marceau. Much later, Sting modelled for photographs wearing one. Mime artist Marcel Marceau, 1963, by Erling Mandelmann In the 1960s, after Jean Seberg's appearance in a marini√®re in the film Breathless, Yves Saint Laurent introduced it into his premier collections, causing a fashion revolution in haute couture. Jean Paul Gaultier has been in love with the marini√®re since the 1980s, in all its forms, styles and the most diverse materials. In 1983, it was the major element of his Boy Toy collection, Gaultier greeting the audience at the end of the show in a \\"classic classic\\", a marini√®re.Two years later, in 1985, Charlotte Gainsbourg wore one in L'Effront√©e. In 2006, the marini√®re was rediscovered as an item of eveningwear. Yvette Horner dressed in a marini√®re to model it for Pierre and Gilles, who used it as the design of flacons for Gaultier's fragrance line \\"Le M√¢le\\". For him and his \\"children\\" and his partners the marini√®re has become an integral part of the world of fashion. In the 2000s, Kenzo Takada started selling marini√®res, with polka dots, Sonia Rykiel having previously used differently coloured stripes, most often black, before returning to white on blue. In 2010, the marini√®re set the trend: the Elite modelling agency in its annual competition, it dressed the finalists in them; Prada added them in its September collection, Gilas Loa√´c's Breton brand Kitsun√©, took it up, as did Dolce & Gabbana, Michael Kors and others. The following year, the France national football team commissioned its supplier Nike for new away kit as a white jersey with blue stripes, taking inspiration from the marini√®re. It was seldom used. Much commented upon - and criticised - this striped kit was dropped eleven months afterwards in favour of a much plainer all-white strip. In April 2011, the boutique Colette had the marini√®re as its theme, represented by many ready-to-wear brands: Chanel, Comme des Gar√ßons, Herm√®s, Ladur√©e, Longchamp and its Montblanc range of baggage, YSL, Swatch, and others. Jean Paul Gaultier had an offering as always, but so did Salvatore Ferragamo, Oscar de la Renta, and The Row. Alex Mabille incorporated it into collections. A year later, Thom Browne used the blue-and-white motif on trousers, for Moncler, followed by A.P.C. and Marc by Marc Jacobs. In addition to traditional French companies Armor Lux, Saint James only since 1982 (which at that time completed its historic wool manufacture with cotton) and the venerable Orcival, who has been manufacturing marini√®res in France since it supplied the French Navy, the brand Petit Bateau have taken up the marini√®re after a long absence, using it in a range of styles. In 2017, the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) has chosen the Orcival Breton top to epitomize the genuine Breton top for its exhibition \\"Is Fashion Modern?\\"  Political symbol  On 19 October 2012, Arnaud Montebourg, the French Industry Minister, wore an Armor Lux marini√®re in a cover photo for Le Parisien's magazine. Montebourg had agreed to the magazine's request to wear the marini√®re, with a French-made watch, in front of French-made household appliances.

Eighteenth-century France saw the beginnings of industrialization across the entire kingdom. It was also a time when landowners, especially noblemen, were trying to apply physiocratic ideas to change their way of cultivating the soil and making crop rotations by introducing, for example, the cultivation of potatoes and artificial grasslands. Other nobles and wealthy citizens were also trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to develop new industries, such as farm ores. Some entrepreneurs foresaw the changes that were going to evolve in the 19th century and worked to take advantage of the country's abundance of natural resources.  The Coal Mines of La Vernade (Saint-Eloy) and La Peize (Gouttieres)  The coal mine of Auvergne was already a source of great wealth in the region, owing to the relative ease by which coal could be shipped to Orl√©ans and the cities of Val de Loire and Paris by the Allier since the opening of the Briare Canal, in spite of delays caused by poor quality and by transportation difficulties which arose from time to time. Aside from the power of few blacksmiths of the country, which just had a rare iron to work, the only outlet was the lime kilns in the region of √âbreuil, and the tiles and pottery from the parish of La P√©rouze (Gouttieres). The route was rather difficult, first requiring a climb on the ‚ÄúPlateau des Chevaliers et des Berthons‚Äù before going down to the upper valley of Gourdonne. The route then traveled back up to Lachamp, after which it was easier to return down to Ebreuil by the track between the Sioule and the C√®pe. But, despite the relative ease of this wide pathway, if we compare it with the three large routes through the valley of the Sioule: by the bridge of the Bouchet, Ch√¢teauneuf and the bridge of Menat, the use horse-drawn carriage was possible, (rather than ox-drawn carriage which is slower and susceptible to fast deterioration), but it‚Äôs more or less obvious that pack horses were used to supply surroundings blacksmiths.  The New Mine  During the second half of the 19th century, new deeper mine shafts were opened: mine shafts named Tollin, Laval, Montjoie, Peyroux, the Croizette, Chazal, Michelin Mercier, and Beaudot. The syndicate benefits of the permission to have at their disposal the coal coming from the search in 1897 and asks a concession, which one is opposed the company of Ch√¢tillon-Commentry.  Working conditions  In 1884, the exhausting and enslaving nature of miner‚Äôs work was brought to national attention by √âmile Zola in his novel Germinal where he regarded it as an \\"impoverishment of the human condition\\". It was also at this time that Carmaux led strikes from 1892-1895 in Tarn‚Äôs coalfield, xxx. He later became a prominent Socialist symbol by acting as the region‚Äôs congressman. Numerous movements were initiated by the syndicates at the Saint-Eloy-Les Mines since the end of the Nineteenth Century, with Gilbert Conchon as a minor delegate. He went to London for a congress, with others delegation, in collaboration with the movements of English coalfield.

It is now the cathedral i.e the Seat of the Bishop of Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon, the ancient and first catholic diocese of India. The Church remains as a memento of the Portuguese rule of old Quilon city. History The history of Infant Jesus Cathedral dates back to 1503 when Tangasseri came under the control of the Portuguese. The Portuguese who came to Quilon in 1503 led by Afonso de Albuquerque made Tangasseri a well fortified city by building a fort, which was called Fortaleza da S√£o Tom√© (known as St. Thomas Fort). Saint Francis Xavier established a church, a college(S√£o Salvador College), a printing press(S√£o Salvador seminary Press), and a religious study centre at Tangasseri during his visits in 1544 and 1549. In 1614, the Portuguese established the Infant Jesus church in its present location. Grave slab of Bishop Charles Hyacinth Valerga in Quilon 400-year-old Infant Jesus Cathedral at Quilon-Tangasseri. In 2006 it was demolished and replaced by a new building Later in 1661, Dutch gained control of Tangasseri and started deteriorating churches and other structures built by Portuguese. But in 1789, the Carmelites missionaries, who have arrived Quilon renovated this church and named it the Bom Jesu Church. In 1838 when Malabar Vicariate was erected with Verapoly as headquarters, Quilon was joined to it. Tangasseri retained its pivotal position in ecclesiastical parlance and became the base for Carmelite expeditions. Quilon vicariate was formed in 1845. Messenger Charles Hyacinth Valerga, pro-vicar Apostolic of Quilon died in Tangasseri on 24 December 1864 and was buried in the church. His successor Msgr. Maria Ephrem Carrelon was consecrated in Tangasseri in 1866. Infant Jesus Church has been serving as the pro-cathedral of Kollam Diocese since 1886. Mortal remains of former Bishop of Quilon, Fr. Bishop Jerome M. Fernandez are also buried in the Infant Jesus Cathedral. As the old Pro-Cathedral was ageing, a plan for a new building both beautiful and large to accommodate the increasing congregation was put forward. The old church was demolished and the foundation stone was laid by the then bishop Rev. Dr. Joseph G Fernandez in 2000 during the tenure of Monsingor Paul Mullassery. Later in the year 2001 Rev. Dr. Stanley Roman became the Bishop of Quilon and carried on with the construction. Rev. Msgr. George Mathew took charge as the parish priest in 2002, taking an active part in the completion of the church in the year 2005. The new structure was completed at a cost of ‚Çπ04,56,00,000(US$845,000 in 2005) and was concentrated by Cardinal Telespher P Toppo (Archbishop of Ranchi), on 3 December 2005 and elevating the status of the church from pro-cathedral to a cathedral. The church is rich and beautiful, with mosaic paintings and glass paintings depicting various stages of Jesus's life. The biggest glass painting is that of the patroness of the Diocese of Quilon, Our Lady of Mount Carmel. A huge bell tower having 3 bells dating back 100 years is an adjacent structure to the cathedral along with a small shrine dedicated to Saint Joseph. A new modern parish house with guest house is built adjacent to the cathedral to accommodate the incoming guests as well as serving as the residence of the parish priest. A small chapel is located under the cathedral and is used for small prayer meetings and masses as well. In 2015, the bell tower was renovated and three new shrines dedicated to various saints of the Catholic world were concentrated. The saints whose statues are placed are Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Sebastian, Saint Francis Xavier and blessed Devasahayam Pillai. In early 2016 one of the bells in the bell tower was made automated which was the first time in the whole diocese. The holy mortal remains of Rev. Jerome .M. Fernandez, the first native Bishop of Quilon is buried in the prayer crypt below the Cathedral. Bishop Jerome .M. Fernandez was elevated to the status Servant of God by Pope Francis on 25 February 2019. The Elevation is the first of four steps to Sainthood. The Grand Celebration of the Elevation was celebrated by Holy Mass which was attended by many thousands of devotees along with all the bishops of Kerala and many dignitaries. 297x297px References Category:Churches in Kollam district Category:Colonial Kerala Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1614 Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:1610s establishments in Portuguese India Category:Archaeological sites in Kerala Category:Portuguese in Kerala Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in India Category:1614 establishments in the Portuguese Empire Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Kerala Category:Church buildings with domes ","title":"Infant Jesus Cathedral"},{"id":"44571979","title":"UEC European Track Championships ‚Äì Men's 1 km time trial"},{"id":"44571980","text":"\\"Zingara\\" (Italian for Gypsy woman) is a song composed by Enrico Riccardi and Luigi Albertelli.

The work is based on the 2002 Kiryat HaYovel supermarket bombing and narrates the final hours in the lives of the suicide bomber and her victims. It was first published in Italy in 2004 through Nutrimenti, and was later published in English on 2 August 2010 through Walker Books. The novel has been published in multiple languages, including Arabic and Hebrew, and has been endorsed by Amnesty International. Ambrosio states that she was inspired to write the work after reading newspaper articles about the bombing and noticing that some of them focused on two sisters that had been killed. Actually there was such an astounding resemblance between Ayat al-Akhras and her victim, Rachel Levy, that the Israeli media, in the first hours after the bombing, spread the news that the suicide bombers were two sisters. Ambrosio went to Israel and Occupied Territories to interview families and friends of the two young girls before writing the novel. Synopsis The book follows Ayat al-Akhras, a seventeen-year-old female suicide bomber that has been sent to a supermarket in Kiryat HaYovel on the even of Passover to kill as many people as possible. It also follows Haim Smadar, a security guard that notices her actions and tries to stop her, losing his life in the process but saving the lives of multiple people. The story begins at seven o'clock in the morning on the day of the attack and ends with the explosion. Despite the very short time span ‚Äì seven hours ‚Äì seen from the points of view of the different characters, the book tries to portray the complex reality between Israel and Palestine.The event, festival magazine, http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/banned-burned-or- simply-life-changing-what-are-the-best-dangerous-books Reception The Herald Scotland gave a mostly positive review for Before We Say Goodbye, writing that it was \\"an imaginatively constructed work\\" and that it had excellent atmosphere but that the \\"weakness of the story is the sense that Ambrosio is sometimes trying to fit the entire Israeli/Palestinian conflict into this short book, making a series of brief references to, for instance, the keys of the Nakba, with the most fleeting of context. This slightly muddles the otherwise uncluttered narrative.\\" Malta Today also praised the work, favorably comparing it to a work by J.M.G. Le Clezio. Reading Time also favorably reviewed the work, writing \\"Young readers are likely to be affected by this unhappy story, but it is probably necessary for all of us, teenagers included, to weep for what is happening before it can be changed.\\" It is studied as an example of human rights literature in universities in UK and Canada.http://yorkpen.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/863/ see: THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO.

Due to the fact that organisations of that kind were not allowed in Hungary in the 80‚Äôs, Csilla von Boeselager established the charity service in Germany as Ungarischer Malteser Caritas-Dienst. In 1989, given the fact that legal obstacles ceased to exist, the Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta was founded and Father Kozma became a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. On 13 August 1989, after celebrating his Sunday Mass, he was asked by the consul of West Germany in Budapest to help accommodate and take care of the East German refugees, who were flooding into Hungary and thus, paralysing the embassy‚Äôs work. Father Kozma agreed to that without the slightest hesitation. As he said it later: \\"A medieval interpretation of the church has come to life again: Shelter\\". Refugees from East Germany were accommodated by the Parish in Zugliget from 14 August. That very evening nearly a thousand people were sheltered but the following months a series of new sanctuaries provided for almost 48 600 people altogether. The consulate of West Germany even moved to the garden of the parish for a time. These events captured the attention of the leadership of East Germany as well; a list of 101 people was compiled of people they were planning to take to the International Court of Justice, with Imre Kozma in the lead, for helping those who violated the laws of \\"Sovereign East Germany\\". The Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta was facing another humanitarian crisis in December, at the time of the Romanian revolution; then they gathered twenty- two truckloads of donations and transported them to Transylvania. At the time of the War in Yugoslavia in the 1990s Father Kozma managed to convince the Serbian commander of Vukovar to let those elderly and young, who were trapped in the city, to flee to Hungary. Since then, the Charity service has built a countrywide network and it is one of the biggest charity services of Hungary. Father Kozma has joined the Humanitarian Medical Order of Knight Hospitallers and he took his vow in 1999, later he became the preceptor in Budapest. He arranged the reintroduction of the Order in Hungary and successfully reclaimed their hospitals in V√°c and Budapest in 2000.

The application is built around a custom dialect of BASIC known as SmileBASIC (not to be confused with the 3DS sequel with the same name). Users can write games and other software using the onscreen keyboard and run the applications from within Petit Computer. The platform supports text-based console applications, visual applications, and any combination of the two. Input is available via hardware buttons, touchscreen input, or the onscreen keyboard. In addition to the code editor and interpreter, Petit Computer includes a simple shell for file management, as well as file sharing functionality. Files can be shared by a direct wireless connection between two DS systems, or by the use of QR codes. The usage of QR codes enabled some users to develop desktop software that can be used to write SmileBASIC and generate a QR code for easy transfer to the DS. Petit Computer comes with several simple sample applications, 5 sample games, and several graphics-editing applications, all written in SmileBASIC with viewable source code. The latter applications can be used to create sprites, backgrounds, and other resources that can then be used within user- created software. Hundreds of premade sprites and tiles are included with Petit Computer. An extensive manual is available from within Petit that describes the basic features and limitations of SmileBASIC, as well as brief descriptions of most of the commands and their syntax. SmileBASIC language Petit Computer uses a customized dialect of BASIC known as SmileBASIC designed specifically for the DSi. Applications written in SmileBASIC can read input from all of the DS's hardware buttons except the Select button (which is always used to terminate the current application) as well as the touch screen, draw graphics and sprites to both screens, and play music written in Music Macro Language. Standard console commands are provided for reading, writing, and manipulating strings. An exhaustive set of graphical commands exists for displaying and manipulating sprites, background graphics, panels, and more, with support for layering, translation, rotation, scaling, palette swapping, and other features, on both screens (some features are limited on the touch screen). Up to 16 channels can be used to play simultaneous audio, with support for fully featured user-defined software instruments and sequenced music. Reception Nintendo Life gave the application 7/10 stars, praising its power and potential, but criticizing the presentation as tailored towards seasoned programmers, as well as the \\"tedious\\" method of entering code via the touch-screen keyboard. Peter Willington at PocketGamer said the interface \\"puts you off experimenting\\" due to the difficulties in entering and navigating text, and complained that error messages weren't useful, but described himself as \\"massively proud\\" of his accomplishments with the software and write that \\"experienced hands will be able to make any kind of software they like\\". Sequels A sequel designed for the Nintendo 3DS, with new features and fewer limitations, released on November 19, 2014 in Japan, October 15, 2015 in North America and August 17, 2017 in Europe. The sequel is titled SmileBASIC (the same name as the dialect of BASIC used in both applications). Nintendo Life gave the application 8/10 stars, praising the removal of QR codes and the power of the language, but again criticizing the cumbersome keyboard. It was recently announced that SmileBASIC would be ported to the Wii U. The program was removed from the North America eShop on July 11, 2016 due to an exploit that existed in between versions 3.2.1 and up to version 3.3.1 of the program. The exploit was fixed in version 3.3.2 of the application, and as a result SmileBASIC was put back up for sale on the North American eShop on August 10, 2016.http://smilebasic.com/en/whatsnew/ As of system version 11.1.0-X released September 12, 2016, when trying to load the game, the system does not allow users to launch the title until the software is updated to version 3.3.2 or higher, forcing users to download the patch, rendering the exploit unusable even if the older version of the game is available.https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/11.1.0-34 Another sequel designed for the Nintendo Switch, called SmileBASIC 4 or Petit Computer 4: SmileBASIC in Japan, was released in Japan on May 23, 2019 and released internationally on April 23, 2020. As well as taking advantage of the functions of the Nintendo Switch hardware, such as the JoyCon controllers and the USB ports on the dock for keyboard and mouse support, the online sharing function now utilises \\"server tickets\\" instead of an ongoing subscription for uploaded programs and games, where each ticket purchased increases the amount of online storage you have. SmileBASIC 4 can be purchased as a bundle with one server ticket, or just as the software alone. A free trial version of SmileBASIC 4 is also available in Japan. Shortly after releasing, the international version of SmileBASIC 4 was temporarily pulled from sale in some areas as SmileBoom discussed ratings with the IARC for two sample programs in the software, GAME_PRG and GAME_SHOOTER. The international version remained on sale in the United States, Canada, and Mexico during this period. SmileBASIC 4 was put back up for sale on June 18, 2020.

Pottery  Emma Gillies was born in the small town of Haddington, outside the city of Edinburgh in Scotland. In Haddington, Gillies joined the Scottish Women‚Äôs Rural Institutes (SWRI) in the early 1920s and was taught by Catherine Blair, a founder of the Institute, how to decorate blanks in the Mak‚ÄôMerry Pottery style. Shortly thereafter, her talents led her to teach classes in the decoration of blanks to new members of the SWRI with Betty Wright, a founding member of the Mak‚ÄôMerry Pottery collective In 1929, Gillies moved to Edinburgh where she began to attend pottery classes in the Sculpture Department of Edinburgh College of Art, the only program which offered Pottery Classes at the College. There she studied under the tutelage of renowned sculptor and Head of School Alexander Carrick until her graduation in 1932 where, in her last semester, she took part in an Exhibition of Metalwork and Pottery \\"at 5 Ramsay Lane [in] Edinburgh\\" published in the Edinburgh newspaper The Scotsman on 3 December of that year. Not a week later, the same publication announced that Gillies had been awarded a one-hundred pound Travelling Scholarship to the London Royal College of Art. The following academic semester, Emma Gillies attended the Royal College of Art in London under William Staite Murray, one of the foremost Scottish potters of the 20th century.Soden (February 2006) However, Gillies was unable to finish her studies in London due to poor health which forced her to return home after completing only a year. Despite her illness, Gillies was exhibited in the prestigious Art Exhibition of the Society of Scottish Artists in October 1935 to critical acclaim before her death at the age of thirty-six in March 1936. After her death, her older brother and famous Scottish landscape and still-life painter William George Gillies painted many of her works as still lifes to memorialise her through his own work.Orton- Hatzis (May 2015) In 2012, several of her art works were discovered at Edinburgh College of Art.

English translation. now often referred to as the T√¥hoku paper,. was published in 1957 in the T√¥hoku Mathematical Journal. It has revolutionized the subject of homological algebra, a purely algebraic aspect of algebraic topology. It removed the need to distinguish the cases of modules over a ring and sheaves of abelian groups over a topological space. Background Material in the paper dates from Grothendieck's year at the University of Kansas in 1955‚Äì6. Research there allowed him to put homological algebra on an axiomatic basis, by introducing the abelian category concept. A textbook treatment of homological algebra, \\"Cartan‚ÄìEilenberg\\" after the authors Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg, appeared in 1956. Grothendieck's work was largely independent of it. His abelian category concept had at least partially been anticipated by others. David Buchsbaum in his doctoral thesis written under Eilenberg had introduced a notion of \\"exact category\\" close to the abelian category concept (needing only direct sums to be identical); and had formulated the idea of \\"enough injectives\\". The T√¥hoku paper contains an argument to prove that a Grothendieck category (a particular type of abelian category, the name coming later) has enough injectives; the author indicated that the proof was of a standard type. In showing by this means that categories of sheaves of abelian groups admitted injective resolutions, Grothendieck went beyond the theory available in Cartan‚ÄìEilenberg, to prove the existence of a cohomology theory in generality. Later developments After the Gabriel‚ÄìPopescu theorem of 1964, it was known that every Grothendieck category is a quotient category of a module category. The T√¥hoku paper also introduced the Grothendieck spectral sequence associated to the composition of derived functors. In further reconsideration of the foundations of homological algebra, Grothendieck introduced and developed with Jean-Louis Verdier the derived category concept. The initial motivation, as announced by Grothendieck at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians, was to formulate results on coherent duality, now going under the name \\"Grothendieck duality\\".Amnon Neeman, \\"Derived Categories and Grothendieck Duality\\", at p. 7 Notes External links *.

Research Since his PhD, Tony Watts has had an interest in both model and biological membranes, using a wide range of biophysical methods to characterize vesicular, model, reconstituted and natural membranes. In early work, lipid-protein interactions were investigated exploiting ESR approaches to relate lipid dynamics to function. In Oxford, newly developed wide-line NMR was developed to characterize surface specificity of lipid-protein and peptide interactions in membranes. More recently, novel solid state NMR approaches have been developed and exploited to resolve high resolution conformational and dynamic details directly of ligand-targets interactions in the absence of target structure, with GPCRs being the current focus.

Established 20 September 1980, the National Circus School of Cambodia accepted its first class of 45 students, most of whom were orphans whose parents were lost under the Pol Pot regime. Traditional Cambodian circus artists had failed to maintain a national cultural presence despite proof illustrating their existence prior to the fall of Angkor in 1352. Sculptures near the Wat temple & the Bayon temple all depict images of traditional circus arts. Yet, even in 1970, these arts were not resurrected until the school opened in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The first class of 45 were taught by Vietnamese and Russian teachers, with ten students continuing their training in Russia. Seeking training from foreign partners was a common tactic to complement the domestic training. Students were also trained in Vietnam, France and China. They have also teamed up with Phare, the circus company based in Siem Reap, Cambodia on a number of occasions, primarily when they put on the Tini Tinou Circus Festival (2) 2012.. The school was managed by the Ministry of Culture and Art from 1980 onwards, before management of the school was transferred to the Royal university of Fine Arts- Choreographic Arts in 1990. The Royal University of Fine arts then split in 2003 into an institution retaining its original name and the intermediate School of Fine Arts, under which the National Circus School of Cambodia is currently managed. The Vietnamese government, artists and teachers continued to offer their support and even provided a fully functional circus tent with 1000 audience seats which was opened on 26 September 2012. Since then, their artists have gained popularity on TV shows such as Cambodia‚Äôs Got Talent (3).

It had been previously known as the Carter Building, and was the tallest building in Texas when it opened in 1910. The building was renamed Second National Bank Building in 1923. History Samuel Fain Carter, the founder of Lumberman's Bank in Houston, commissioned the architecture firm of Sanguinet and Staats to design a sixteen-floor, steel-framed building on Main Street at the corner of Rusk Street in Houston. The Fort Worth-based Sanguinet and Staats had already been building skyscrapers in various cities in Texas, and was building a reputation for this type of structure. In 1909, the building had an estimated cost of $650,000. Carter planned to finance construction through issues of equity and debt, stipulating that he would restrict bonds to $400,000 in value. The Rice Institute agreed to purchase up to $200,000 in bonds. Bender Hotel shares Main Street in the background At the time of its completion in 1910, the Carter Building was the tallest structure in Texas. Many Houstonians expressed doubt that a building so tall was structurally sound, and that a commercial building so far from Houston's business core would prosper. Many called the building \\"Carter's Folly.\\" The Carter Building was equipped with indoor plumbing and drinking fountains dispensing cold water. Interiors of all floors were decorated in Italian and Norwegian marble. Electric lights and fans were installed in each office, as well as sinks. Carter, who had founded the Lumberman's Bank in 1907, used space on the sixteenth floor for his own office, though he opted to keep the bank at its original location on Main at Prairie. Lumberman's Bank changed its name to Second National Bank in 1923.Kirkland (2012), p.182. Carter sold the building in 1923 to the financial institution he founded, Second National Bank of Houston. The bank hired Boston-based architectural firm Thomas M. James Company to design a six-story addition, with assistance from Sanguinet, Staats, Hedrick, and Gottlieb. By the late 1920s, real estate development had intensified around the building and many prominent professionals were leasing office space there. John William Neal assumed the chairmanship of Second National Bank in 1929, then hired Heddrick and Gottlieb design an elaborate second-floor board room for the bank. South Coast Life Insurance acquired the building in 1955, while Second National Bank gradually withdrew from occupancy and had completed vacated by the late 1950s. In 1969, First National Life Insurance bought the building and modernized the facings with a slipcover featuring glass and Georgian-marble panels. By 2006, some of these marble panels had been warped and replaced with plywood. In October 2009, the Second National Bank Building sold for $3 million. The purchaser, Pearl Real Estate of Fort Worth, specializes in the development, construction, and operation of hotels. At the time of purchase, forty office tenants were leasing a total 70,000 square feet, and the last of these tenants was scheduled to vacate in February 2010. The office building had 204,000 square feet of rentable space. A Christian Science Reading Room and a Domino's Pizza had been renting ground-level retail space. Renovation Pearl Hospitality hired Gensler to design and manage the restoration of the Carter Building and its transformation into a luxury hotel. The project cost over $80 million, but the restoration is partly supported with public funding. The City of Houston loaned $7.35 million at low-interest. Houston's Downtown Redevelopment Authority provided $12 million in subsidies. Pearl Hospitality would operate the hotel branded as JW Marriott. Some of Downtown Marriott's hotel occupancy taxes will be reimbursed. Detail of restored quoining of the Carter Building, now JW Marriott Hotel Pearl Hospitality outlined its restoration plan in an application to the Houston Archaeological and Historical Commission. The plan included removing the 1960s glass and marble slipcover, restoration of ornaments that had been removed or had deteriorated, and removing modern aluminum window and door frames at the retail level, then replacing them with original materials. On November 19, 2014, JW Marriott held a grand opening for its 328-room hotel at 806 Main Street, the site of the restored Carter Building. The hotel also opened with the Main Kitchen and the 806 Bar & Lounge at street level. References Additional Resources * * Jeanette H.

A kart racing game, also known as cart racing game or go-kart racing game, is a subgenre of racing video games. Kart racing games have simplified driving mechanics while including unusual racetrack designs, obstacles, and vehicular combat. Though the genre has its roots in the 1980s, Super Mario Kart (1992) and Crash Team Racing (1999) are the two games that popularized the genre, with the Mario Kart series still being considered the foremost kart racing franchise. Mechanics and traits Kart racing games are known to have simplified driving mechanics while adding obstacles, unusual racetrack designs and various action elements. Kart racers are also known to cast fictional characters, particularly from media franchises as the drivers of vehicles with unusual designs, often reflecting the distinct trait or personality of the character driving it. Kart racing games are a more arcade-like experience than other racing games and usually offer over-the-top gameplay in which player characters can shoot projectiles against one another, collect power-ups to gain advantage, or performing special techniques to gain a speed boost. Typically, in such games, vehicles move more like go-karts and scooters, lacking anything along the lines of a gear stick and clutch pedal. Kart racing games are distinct from and not to be confused with kart simulators, which is a subgenre of racing simulator games that simulates actual kart racing without over-the-top gameplay elements. History Power Drift featured go-kart racing in 1988, but Super Mario Kart (1992) is cited to have started the kart racing genre, being the first kart racing game to implement combat elements within races. The game was also slower than other racing games of the time due to hardware limitations, prompting its developers to use a go-kart theme. Since then, over 50 kart racing games have been released, featuring characters ranging from Nicktoons to South Park. The Mario Kart series is often considered as the pioneer of kart racing series, topping other popular games such as Diddy Kong Racing. The genre seems to have been the most popular among developers during the 1990s, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (2017), Mario Kart DS (2005), and Mario Kart Wii (2008) being three of the best-selling kart racing games.

History Plummer Roddis started out as separate companies in the 19th Century. William Plummer started out as a draper in Hastings and in 1871 had a store at 3 Robertson Street, before opening another store in Southampton on the corner of Above Bar and Commercial Street. George Roddis in 1870 was listed as a draper in Market Harborough, but by 1881 was a partner in a drapers & milliners called Roddis & Goldsmith at 1-2 Robertson Street, Hastings. In the late 19th Century William Plummer, George Roddis and Reginald Tyrrell, a Bournemouth draper, joined forces to create Plummer, Roddis and Tyrrell but in 1898 Reginald Tyrrell relinquished his partnership to concentrate on his other business Tyrrell & Green and the business became Plummer Roddis. The business continued to grow opening branches in Boscombe, Brighton, Bath, Eastbourne,Folkestone, Andover Weymouth, and Yeovil. The business was celebrated by being mentioned in H. G. Wells book Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul. Plummer Roddis building Hastings 1927 In 1927 the Hastings store was rebuilt by renowned architect Henry Ward (he also designed the additions to the Brighton store), while the Southampton store and Bournemouth store were extensively rebuilt, the last work before World War II being completed at Bournemouth to the designs of the architect Jonathan Makepeace in 1938. The head office of the Plummer Roddis group was based in Sillwood Road, Brighton. During the Second World War the Southampton store was destroyed by German bombing, and operated out of different locations across the city until a new store was completed in 1965. However, by this time Plummer Roddis had been bought by Debenhams, who invested in a new branch to be built in Guildford, which opened in 1968. In the early 1970s the stores were rebranded as Debenhams, except for the Southampton store. In 1972 the Bournemouth store was re-opened as a Debenhams by Terry Wogan, but for the store to be closed down a year later when Debenhams rebranded the Bobby & Co. store in the town. The Boscombe branch had been closed the previous year. By 2014 the only Plummer Roddis stores that operated as Debenhams still open were Guildford and Hastings. The Southampton store continued to operate under the Plummer Roddis name until 14 August 1993, when the store closed its doors for the last time. The store is now home to a teaching centre for Southampton Solent University.

It was built 'quickly and cheaply' in 1874, with the intention of providing ministry to the poor living in the nearby slums of Pimlico. History and architecture The interior facing south-west toward the organ In London during the 19th century, there was rapid development of Belgravia and Pimlico which was accompanied by the building of many new churches in the area. In addition, the construction of the London Underground resulted in many houses being demolished by the 'cut and cover' works. In 1874, St Mary's was built directly over the path of the District line in the Early English style using cheap machine-made red brick. The church was designed by RJ Withers, a little known architect practising predominantly in the West Country. Withers had previously undertaken alterations to churches in London, and was working at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, when the decision to build St Mary's was taken. With his reputation, according to his obiturist, of building ‚Äòa good cheap type of brick church‚Äô, he was the obvious choice to design St Mary's, which was originally intended to act as a servant's church. Other architectural features resulting from the economic construction include low windowless aisles and plain slate roof with a bell cote housing a solitary bell. Buttressing was added by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel following bomb damage in World War II. In its report of the dedication on 4 July 1874, the Church Times described the interior of St Mary‚Äôs: \\"A spacious nave is terminated in an apsidal chancel and there are two aisles. The nave is very lofty and the interior of the roof is elaborately decorated with colour. Bold figures of Our Lady and St John on either side of a crucifix appear on the reredos, in front of which stands one of the most effective altars we have seen of late. It is formed of sweet cedar, and is richly ornamental with gold and colour. The chapel as a whole is remarkably effective, and has a solid and substantial look which is highly satisfactory. It is, in a word, an excellent specimen of an inexpensive church, the cost of the whole, not counting special gifts such as the reredos, altar, font etc., being about ¬£4,500.\\". The paintings in the arcade spandrels are by Nathaniel Westlake (1895-6): Eve, Ruth, Esther, David and Daniel on the south wall and Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Ezekiel on the north. Also the Annunciation and Mary meeting Elizabeth in the chancel. In the chapel of the Seven Sorrows, next to the altar, a new rose window by Margaret Aldrich Rope replaced that damaged in the war. The west window of St George and St Edward the Confessor, hidden behind the organ, was added in 1897, designed by Mary Lowndes. Present day The liturgy and worship at St Mary's combines Gregorian chant, Renaissance, Viennese and contemporary sacred music with the language of the Book of Common Prayer. The ceremonial is traditional. The musical staff is led by the Director of Music, Paul Brough, supported by the Organist, Richard Hills. Previous Directors of Music include David Trendell and William Whitehead. The parish stands within the Catholic tradition of the Church of England. It has passed resolutions A and B, thereby rejecting the ordination of women. The church is not a member of the traditionalist Catholic organisation, Forward in Faith, nor of the Liberal Catholic group, Affirming Catholicism.

Kinnear was also a pioneer photographer credited with inventing the bellows attachment on early cameras. Life He was born in Kinloch House, near Collessie in Fife the son of Christian Jane Greenshields, a rich heiress, and Charles Kinnear a banker in the family firm of Thomas Kinnear & Co. Kinnear can be presumed to have had a privileged life. For most of his early life he lived at 125 Princes Street in Edinburgh.Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Kinnear His elder brother, John Boyd Kinnear, was a politician. After private schooling and a degree at the University of Edinburgh he trained as an architect under first William Burn then David Bryce, both based in Edinburgh. In 1852 he inherited a large number of properties, reducing any immediate need to be employed. In 1853/4 he appears to have toured Sicily and Italy, and is known to have sketched in both Palermo and Pisa. He was asked to join the rising John Dick Peddie as a partner in 1855, bringing an always-welcome large cash injection to the firm as a result. At the same time he set up his own home at 12 Alva Street where he lived until death. Despite a second huge inheritance in 1856, he continued to work, clearly having a degree of love for it, rather than a financial need. On the retiral of John Dick Peddie Kinnear went into partnership with Peddie‚Äôs son, John More Dick Peddie, placing his name to the front to create the lesser known firm of Kinnear & Peddie. They also employed Peddie‚Äôs fifth son, Walter Lockhart Dick Peddie (b.1865).Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Kinnear In 1893 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan, Sir Arthur Mitchell, Alexander Crum Brown and A Gillies Smith.

Photography The west side of Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh In 1856, together with David Bryce, David MacGibbon and Sir David Brewster, Kinnear was a founding member of the Photographic Society of Scotland, acting as Secretary during Brewster‚Äôs Presidency. He made a photographic study of Milan in the same year. In 1857 he contracted a Mr Bell of Potterow, Edinburgh to create a new camera, which is said to be the first use of a customised bellows, allowing complete darkness whilst comfortably adjusting the focal plane. He used this new camera on a study tour of Germany and northern France. Military career In 1859 he joined the First Midlothian County (Midlothian Coast) Artillery Volunteer Brigade (at that time an equivalent to today‚Äôs Territorial Army) as a junior officer. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in July 1860 and in 1861 became Captain of the Portobello battalion. After rising to become Major Kinnear, he was one of the three majors who personally financed the Regimental Headquarters on Grindlay Street in 1866. Death and legacy The grave of Charles Kinnear, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh He died suddenly of a heart attack after a normal day at the office in November 1894 and was buried against the north wall in the northern extension to the original Dean Cemetery. Unusually for an architect, he was given a full military funeral.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Kinnear He is buried with his wife, Jessie Jane Maxwell (1845-1931) and three daughters. The grave lies against the northern outer wall, towards the north-west. It lies not far from his business partner, John More Dick Peddie, who lies on the southern wall of the same section. Although his estate was large, a high proportion went to pay off the debts of his brother John. His son Charles Maxwell Kinnear became a tobacco manufacturer and the younger son, Norman Boyd Kinnear, a keen ornithologist, went on to become Director of the British Museum in 1947. Works Pitreavie Castle by Kinnear & Peddie As part of Peddie & Kinnear, Charles‚Äô output was huge. He is known to have contributed the historical aspect of the designs. They did many banks and churches but are best remembered in Edinburgh for Cockburn Street: a specific town planning exercise, creating a serpentine link down from the Royal Mile to improve access to Waverley Station. =As Kinnear & Peddie= See.Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Kinnear & Peddie *Monteath Mausoleum (1864) *Terrace, 1-37 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh (1879) *30-34 Palmerston Place, Edinburgh (1879) *Callander Hydropathic (1879) (funded by John Dick Peddie) *Completion of Chalmers Street in Edinburgh (1879) *Longmore Hospital for Incurables (asylum) (1879) now Longmore House, home to Historic Scotland (extended by Kinnear in 1891) *94 George Street, Edinburgh (1880) *Kirkintilloch Church and manse (1881) *Sunbury Mews, Edinburgh (1881) built as stables *Extra floors and ornamentation, 2-8 Cockburn Street Edinburgh (1882) *Kirkcudbright Railway Station (1882) *Lodge house, Newington Cemetery (1883) *Rebuilding of Cortachy Castle following a major fire (1883) *Mosswater Cottages, Fife (1884) *Remodelling of Pitreavie Castle plus new stables and gate lodge (1884-6) *Sandgate Street and Foul Ford in Berwick-upon-Tweed (1884) *Royal Bank and tenement over, Campbeltown (1885) *Villa at 6 Ravelston Park, Edinburgh (1885) *Slogarie House and attached Cottages, Kirkcudbrightshire (1886) *British Linen Bank, Dunfermline (1887) *Feuing of streets for housing, Craiglockhart, Edinburgh (1887) *Four villas on Morningside Drive, Edinburgh (1887) *Reconstruction of Kinglassie Parish Church (1887) *Lochmaddy Combination Poorhouse, North Uist (1887) *British Linen Bank, Clydebank (1888) *Southwick Parish Church, Kirkcudbrightshire (1889-90) *Reredos, St John‚Äôs Episcopal Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh (1890) *Caledonian Railway Station, Lothian Road Edinburgh (1890-3) demolished *Caputh Fountain, Caputh, Perthshire (1890) *Mission Hall, Ellon, Aberdeenshire (1890) *North Berwick Golf Clubhouse (1890) *Niddrie Mains School, Edinburgh (1890) *British Linen Bank, Greenock (1891) *British Linen Bank, Coldstream, Berwickshire (1891) *British Linen Bank, Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire (1893) *Dalton Parish Church (1893) =Sole Works= *Mosswater Farmhouse and Steading, Fife (1852) *Kinnear Farmhouse and Steading, Fife (1853) *Valley Cemetery, Old Town, Stirling (1857) *Stoneykirk Parish Church (1859) *Tenement, 64-70 Great Junction Street, Leith (1859) *Remodelling of his family seat, Kinloch House near Collessie (1880) *Office at 94 George Street, Edinburgh (1880) References *Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford McWilliam and Walker Category:1830 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th-century Scottish architects Category:Architects from Edinburgh Category:Burials at the Dean Cemetery Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"Charles Kinnear"},{"id":"44573244","text":"Houston County Courthouse may refer to: *Houston County Courthouse (Alabama), Dothan, Alabama *Houston County Courthouse (Georgia), Perry, Georgia *Houston County Courthouse and Jail, Caledonia, Minnesota *Houston County Courthouse (Tennessee), Erin, Tennessee *Houston County Courthouse (Texas), Crockett, Texas, listed on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"Houston County Courthouse"},{"id":"44573249","text":"Nadar Countess Emanuela Potocka, born Princess Emanuela Pignatelli di Cerchiara (1852-1930), was an Italian-Polish noblewoman and fashionable saloni√®re in Paris during the 19th century.

Family and early life Hobhouse was born on 2 February 1934 to Sir Arthur Hobhouse and Konradin Huth Jackson at Hadspen House, Castle Cary in Somerset. She was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she read Modern History. Her sister believed Hermione's exposure to Victorian Gothic architecture in this period ignited her interest. On 2 July 1955, Lady Hobhouse held a small \\"coming-of-age\\" dance for Hermione and her sister Virginia at Hadspen. Career After a short spell in the United States, Hobhouse took a job as a researcher with Granada Television. After this she began working as a freelance writer. Her first book, published in 1959, was a history of the Ward of Cheap in the City of London. She was the author of Lost London (1971), in whose introduction she wrote: Between 1973 and 1978 she gave lectures in architectural history at the Architectural Association as well as in the United States into the 1980s. In 1976 Hobhouse succeeded Jane Fawcett as secretary of the Victorian Society, a group that campaigns to conserve Victorian and Edwardian buildings. A later chair, Peter Howell, said of her in this period: Her assistant at the Victorian Society, Louise Nicholson, recalled: It was a post she held until leaving in 1983 to work as general editor of the Survey of London. During her tenure she oversaw publication of survey volumes on part of Kensington and the challenging prospect of covering the Docklands area of East London at a time when it was dramatically changing and developing. She also edited a monograph for the survey on the former GLC County Hall. Honours and external interests In 1981 Hobhouse was appointed MBE. She was also made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, where she served as a council member between 1984 and 1987. She served on the council of the National Trust (1983‚Äì2001) and of the Royal Albert Hall (1988‚Äì2004). In the late 20th century the Royal Albert Hall underwent a five-year programme of refurbishment, and she was reported as having supervised the reinstatement of stencilling in the public areas. She supported the Clapham Society and the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust. When the Reform Club allowed female members for the first time Hobhouse was one of the first to join. She was a keen supporter of the campaign to restore the club's home in Pall Mall, an Italianate palazzo by Charles Barry. Death Hobhouse died on 17 October 2014, aged 80. Personal life Hobhouse married architect Harry Graham in 1958. The marriage produced two children ‚Äì a son, Francis, and daughter, Harriet ‚Äì before being amicably dissolved. Hobhouse was survived by her children.

He studied under Henri Duveyrier, the Saharan explorer, who developed Foureau's own interest in the subject. Once in the Sahara, Foureau carried out the first artesian well drilling for the company Oued RIHR and then became famous for his numerous study trips in the desert from 1882, which earned him several awards from the French Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie.N√©crologie de Fernand Foureau by Henri Schirmer in the Annales de G√©ographie, 1914, vol.23 , pp. 179-182.Fernand Foureau's Obituary in The Geographical Journal, vol. 43-5, 1914, p. 587-588.

History  Bruckner composed this \\"cantata\\"C. Howie, Chapter II, p. 23 on a text of Hillischer in 1854.C. van Zwol, p. 722 The piece was intended to be sung by the Frohsinn for the Joyous Entry of Elisabeth of Bavaria, then the bride of Franz Joseph of Austria, known as Sisi, in Linz on 22 April 1854. However, Bruckner's composition was not performed, but instead a transcription of the Bavarian national hymn with the same text by Hillischer. Another text by Anton August Naaf, \\"'\\" (To you, lovely homeland, should sound the faithful song of highest love), was used for the music for a performance of the Wiener Schubertbund on 15 June 1898. Later again, another text was put by Anton Weiss for the Wiener Schubertbund. Bruckner's autograph manuscript is stored in the archive of the Ober√∂sterreichisches Landesarchiv.Anton Bruckner-Lexicon online: ‚ÄûLa√üt Jubelt√∂ne laut erklingen‚Äú (WAB 76) A facsimile of the work with Naaf's text was first published in band III/2, pp. 162‚Äì179 of the G√∂llerich/Auer biography, with Hillischer's original text in footnote.

O rejoice friendly towards him, All fortune lies in his hand, From him alone streams all blessing Beneficially on the country. Like our mountains firm and daring, Like our air, so fresh and pure, Should our true and noble mind, Should our faith be for the emperor. May God protect the two-headed Austrian eagle, Hear our devoted prayer, Protect our noble imperial couple Franz Josef and Elisabeth. }  Music  The 100-bar long work in E-flat major is scored for choir and brass instruments (2 horns, 2 trumpets and 4 trombones). The work consists of two related sections and a coda. While the horns and the trumpets are used only to contribute brief fanfare, pedal tones, and occasionally to the roots of otherwise incomplete chords, the four trombones almost always double the voices. Like other Bruckner's works, the work begins with a distinctive motive that provides much of the ensuing musical material. Obvious derivatives of this motive form the beginning and the ending of each section, and all of the imitative passages are based on developments of it. Since no two statements of this tune are identical, it provides both musical unity and variety. The music is of substantial interest, because it contains an attractive blend of progressive and textural variety.K. W.

Leis already realized his idea of an international singing competition for children and young people in his later years as a musician and producer in Germany, but with the increasing internationalization of his contest's organizing committee, it was renamed as Euro Pop Contest \\"Berliner Perle\\" in 2009. Format The contest is usually held at the Russian House of Science and Culture because the venue has been the long-term supporter of the competition and is where the selection of entries which a country sends to the contest is done. Submission of entries to the contest is done through various methods such as that via a sent video application. It could also be done through a regional finals followed by a national qualifying round as is practiced by Russia, Bulgaria, Poland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, where their country's representative to the contest for the year is determined through a national selection finals. In Austria, an online pre-selection is done to determine the entry for the country. In other cases, the Organizing Committee of the contest decides on the submitted applications sent by e-mail by one country where no preliminary selection took place. Participation Formerly, only citizens of European countries were eligible to participate in the contest, but since 2014 the contest has accepted participants from outside Europe, with the Philippines being the first country to do so. Hosting The contest has always been hosted by Berlin, Germany and is entirely funded by contributions from participating nations. The contest has no sponsors; instead, it has several partners who help conduct the implementation of the competition within the framework of possibilities.

Chickering (July 29, 1817 ‚Äì July 3, 1879) was a prison reformer in the late 1800s, who worked to establish separate prisons for female inmates in Massachusetts and founded the Temporary Asylum for discharged female prisoners which later became known as the Dedham Temporary Home for Women and Children, which operated between 1864 and 1969 in Dedham, MA.The Chickering Foundation. Our Mission and History. 1969. Website. 2 December 2014. Early life Born on July 29, 1817, in Dedham, Massachusetts, Chickering was the youngest of seven children and the fourth daughter in her family. Although, she was raised in the Unitarian faith, she ultimately decided to become an Episcopalian. She was a devoted member of her church, participated in parish work, and taught the local children during Sunday School. Chickering's faith and unyielding belief in God would provide strength throughout her life and guidance in her work.The Chickering Foundation In 1846, around the age of 29, Chickering moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she continued her role in the church teaching Sunday School to young girls. One of her students, wrote this of a young Chickering, \\"Before knowing Miss Chickering I rather feared her. She seemed to me and others of our set of girls rather stern and strict. And I must confess it was with feelings of dread that we accepted her as our Sunday- school teacher. Very soon, however, this all changed, and as we knew her so we loved and respected her. If one was candid and honest with her there was nothing to fear.\\"Dexter, Sarah E. Recollections of Hannah B. Chickering. Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1881. Book. pg 7-9. Sometime around 1854, Chickering moved back to Dedham, Massachusetts where she spent her days caring for the ill, it was during this time when she decided that her life's work should be toward promoting the good in other people. In \\"Recollections of Hannah B. Chickering,\\" Sarah E. Dexter described Chickering as a woman with \\"...a strong element of self-sacrifice united to the utmost fidelity to duty. Her question was always, What ought I to do?\\"Dexter, pg 5-6, 12. Chickering would discover the answer a few years later while on a return visit to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to see a close friend.The Chickering Foundation. Dedham temporary home for women and children In the early 1860s, Chickering visited a friend in Philadelphia, who once a week spent an afternoon with the female prisoners of the Pennsylvania State Penitentiary.The Chickering Foundation. Chickering requested to join her friend on her visit to the Penitentiary one Tuesday afternoon, to help uplift the spirits of the women through prayer and religious teachings. In a letter written by the friend about the visit she remarked how Chickering, \\"...at once became warmly interested in the work and never afterwards during her whole visit failed to devote the Tuesday afternoons to it with an enthusiasm and hopefulness...\\".Dexter,pg 18-19. Once Chickering returned to her home in Dedham, Massachusetts, she sought to continue the work she had begun in Philadelphia with the women prisoners of the Dedham Jail. Initially, Chickering had fears the female prisoners in the Dedham Jail would not take warmly to her company or teachings, but these fears dissipated after her first few visits. Soon Chickering became a regular at the Dedham Jail, when she arrived each Sunday the women awaited eagerly for their weekly religious lesson.Dexter, pg 20-21. Overtime Chickering established herself in the Jail's community, setting up a library and appointed herself as the prison's chaplain.The Chickering Foundation During these visits in the Dedham Jail, Chickering begun to realize that the female prisoners were not receiving any rehabilitation efforts afforded to the male prisoners. There were no programs that prepared the women for their release back into society, which resulted in the women resorting to their old methods of survival, crime, resulting in their re-arrest and imprisonment. Chickering observed the cycle repeat its self and its effect on the women, \\"...and this mournful round is trodden again and again, till a wretched death closes the scene for these victims of misfortune, neglect, and sin.\\"Rafter, Nicole Hahn. Partial Justice: Women, Prisons, and Social Control. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1990. Book. pg 42-43. From what she had seen first hand in the Dedham Jail, Chickering realized there was desperate need to reform these women so they could lead productive lives once they were released from prison. What transpired was the \\"Temporary Asylum for Discharged Female Prisoners,\\" founded 1864, referred today as the \\"Dedham Temporary Home for Women and Children.\\"The Chickering Foundation The Asylum officially open its doors on November 15, 1864, its first residents were women recently released from the Dedham Jail, and as of 1881 Sarah Dexter wrote \\"...nearly one thousand women and one hundred children have been received into its shelter.\\"Dexter, pg 27. Chickering choose a 25-acre farm in Dedham on which to operate the Asylum that she reportedly acquired for a low purchase price. On the property was a large residential home, barn, and many outbuildings scattered throughout the 25 acres.The Chickering Foundation The main goal of the Asylum was to rebuild the self-confidence of the women, so that they would not only respect themselves but also respect the society they were working towards re-entering. Chickering and the matrons also worked to help find the discharged female prisoners secure forms of employment before leaving the Asylum. To aid in this, the women would learn basic domestic skills, which would help them get jobs cleaning local businesses, and in private residences.The Chickering Foundation. History of Dedham Temporary Home for Women and Children (continued). 1969. Website. 02 December 2014. . Work in Massachusetts prison reform Chickering in addition to helping facilitate the rehabilitation of women at the Dedham Asylum, continued to visit women in prisons and correctional institutions all over the State of Massachusetts. During her visits, Chickering continued to witness the lack of reform, degrading treatment and minimal security provided to female inmates, particularly the treatment of female prisoners at the hands of male guards as well as the male inmates caught her attention. Chickering argued that treatment of women prisoners by the officers and male inmates was degrading, a term used specifically by 19th century women prison reformers to reference acts of rape and sexual assault.Dexter, pg 31-32Freedman, Estelle B. Their Sisters' Keepers: Women's Prison Reform in American, 1830-1930. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1981. Book. pg 59 For these reasons, Chickering saw the urgent need for separate prison facilities for women, which she argued should employ an all female staff to ensure not only protection from sexual attack, but to facilitate the rehabilitation programs for the female prisoners during their incarceration.Dexter, pg 33. On November 27, 1869, Chickering held a public meeting at St. Paul's Chapel in Dedham, to propose the need for separate prisons for women, it was at this meeting that a committee of five men and two women was formed to help see Chickering's proposal realized.Dexter, pg 33-32.The Chickering Foundation The Committee finally presented their proposed plan for a women's prison on February 24, 1871, at a hearing before the Massachusetts Legislative Prison Committee at the State House in Boston.Dexter, pg 36. The bill for separate prisons for women finally passed 1874, after previously being defeated many times and many signed petitions, Chickering had succeeded in her efforts. However, Chickering's work was not over, as she was very involved in the execution and planning of what would ultimately be the opening in 1877 of the Reformatory of Women at Sherborn, MA.The Chickering Foundation Final years Soon after the opening of the Reformatory in Sherborn, it was apparent that Chickering's health was in decline, but according to friends retiring from her work was far from an easy task for Chickering. Even at the end of her life, Chickering would not accept praise or take credit for the success of her work in prison reform or the Asylum, as she refused to allow her picture to be hung in the farm house even at the request of the matrons who now ran the facility in Dedham.Dexter, pg 41-42. Chickering died on July 3, 1879, in her home, and the funeral was held two days later at the Church of the Good Shepard at Oakdale in Dedham. The female inmates of her beloved Asylum were in attendance to a mourn a woman who many of them regarded as a \\"best friend.\\"Dexter, pg 49-50. The Temporary Asylum in Dedham would remain in operation until 1969 when it closed, the same year The Chickering Foundation was established to fund various charities and organizations, to carry on Chickering's legacy of self-service for the good of others.The Chickering Foundation Part of the land on which the Asylum stood now is home to the Baby Cemetery, which is the final resting place of children born to women at the Asylum.

It is the town's primary park and covers an area of approximately . The park was designed to include significant sporting provisions, along with formal gardens, a boating lake and woodland area. It was designed and built in the 1920s, under the eye of Thomas Mawson. It is located in the Great Marton and Layton areas of the town. It is Grade II* listed and is on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. The park's largest gardens feature a fountain built with Italian marble and a number of statues including a pair of Medici Lions. The Italian gardens are overlooked by a cafe, designed by Mawson and built in a traditional Art Deco style, and include steps down to the boating lake. Surrounding the boating lake is a woodland area, including a protected area for wildlife. On one side of the lake is an amphitheatre surrounding a bandstand, also designed by Mawson. Towards the centre of the park there is a crossroads with a clock tower, dedicated to William Cocker. It is close to the large children's play area, the tennis courts, all-weather pitches, BMX track, skate park and general grassy areas. Within the Stanley Park grounds stands a 5000-seat cricket ground, an 18-hole golf course designed by Alister MacKenzie, a sports centre, athletics ground and a model village attraction. History Ironwork over a Stanley Park gate Due to large growth of Blackpool's population between 1870 and 1900 the council decided that an outdoor attraction was required, to \\"appeal to all ages and all classes\\". It took until the 1920s to begin implementation of the plans. Much of the land was sold to the council, for the purpose of constructing a park, by Albert Lindsay Parkinson and additional areas of land were compulsory purchased and some donated (by mayor of Blackpool, John Bickerstaffe, T.M. Watson and William Lawson). The land previously consisted of \\"the most heterogeneous collection of hen runs, pigsties, stagnant ponds, caravan dwellings and stables we have ever come across. The buildings were of temporary nature, margarine boxes, tea chests, biscuit tins and petrol cans being pressed into service for walls and roofing material\\" The plans for Stanley Park were drawn up by landscape architect and town planning company T.H. Mawson & Sons. A Lancashire businessman reportedly told Mawson that without the Blackpool resort there would be a 'revolution in Lancashire', as it was a popular destination for many industry workers. When the park came to be built in the 1920s, the provision of sporting activities for the middle classes was an important theme for British resort towns. The park was opened on 2 October 1926 by the 17th Earl of Derby, on the same day as opening the new marine promenade. The marine promenade cost ¬£320,000 and at the opening the Earl cut a black and white ribbon using gold scissors. He then gave the mayor half a crown to counteract his superstitions regarding the ribbon colours. The park was named \\"Stanley Park\\" after the Earl's family name and he opened the park using a golden key at the main gates. He was then driven to the Italian Gardens to address the crowds and acknowledged the towns motto 'Progress' and stated that Blackpool continued to be a town that continued to invest for the future. At the opening of the park in 1926 it was estimated the project had cost ¬£250,000 (). News of the park opening spread as far as America and it was described as providing \\"for the recreational needs of the modern generation\\". Current status Woodland walks through Stanley park Stanley Park covers and is situated north-east of the centre of Blackpool (OS National Grid Reference: SD 3235; National Grid Reference: 332500, 435700). The park is located between the residential areas of Great Marton and Layton and is surrounded by housing except on the east side. The original plans specified that there should be no housing on the park side of the road, so all housing is on the opposite side. The park is enclosed by 3 roads; East Park Drive, West Park Drive and North Park Drive with South Park Drive leading from the southerly tip to the A583 road. Within the park there are four zones which are loosely separated into north and western formal gardens; the eastern area has a lake and woodland area and the south of the park contains children's play areas and sports facilities. The park area is Grade II* registered and is on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. The park is owned and managed by Blackpool Council. It achieved the Green Flag Award in 2008, which it has continued to hold in subsequent years. On November 29, 2017 Stanley Park was announced as the winner of the 2017 Fields in Trust UK's Best Park, as voted by YOU! award, having topped the public vote. The park is open every day of the year between dawn and dusk; the public are alerted to exit the park via a horn sound 15 minutes before closing. It is estimated that the park receives over two million visitors a year. The park remained the most recent park development in Blackpool until 2006, when George Bancroft Park was opened. Features =Italian gardens and art deco cafe= One of the new Medici lion statues The Italian Garden in the centre of the park has many flower beds and a central fountain made from Italian marble. The fountain and the four surrounding sea horses, were donated by Magee Marshall & Co in 1926. It now has a large number of benches though this was not the case when the park first opened. At the steps leading to the cafe from the Italian Gardens, there are two Medici lions statues which were produced, by Rupert Harris Conservation, using casts from the former sculptures which were returned, on loan, to Stowe House in 2013. The original lions, and shepherds and shepherdesses (probably from the Grecian valley, after 1749), were donated by John Magee in 1926 after being purchased during the sale of Stowe House in 1921. Three of the Four Shepherd statues in the Italian Gardens were stolen, probably for scrap metal, in 2011 which prompted Blackpool Council to ensure the safety of the lions. There were a number of vandal attacks on the statues and so an agreement was formed for the lease of the Lions to Stowe House. In return for the loan Stanley Park received exact copies (but with steel armature), new plinths and secured free access for Blackpool residents at Stowe House. In 2014, the Italian Gardens received four new statues which were purchased by the council to replace the shepherd and shepherdesses. The second hand granite statues were bought from a reclamation yard and they represent the four seasons. Initial designs, for the art deco cafe, outlined a four-storey social centre which was designed to look like a country mansion. Due to financial strains this was re-designed, as it now stands, as a cafe in an art deco style which was designed to appear larger than it was. The cafe is constructed from brick with sandstone features and has mahogany doors and steel framed windows The cafe, \\"Parks\\" is licensed to sell alcohol and holds a number of musical events including a regular afternoon tea dance for Blackpool Carers. =Lake and surroundings= View across boating lake The lake covers around 22 acres and was created using a natural depression and imported rock to prevent erosion. There is a central island in the lake which can be accessed by two stone bridges. The lake's tourist boating previously consisted of rowing boats and canoes though is now popular with motorboats and pedalos. An old Blackpool, oar propelled, lifeboat, The Samuel Fletcher, was previously used as a pleasure cruiser on the lake. Boathouses were built in 1935 next to the lake. These consist of a 2-storey structure with two adjacent single storey buildings which contain an ice-cream kiosk and equipment storage Crossing the lake are two Italianate style stone bridges built between 1926 and 1933 The lake is regularly used by fishermen though this has previously caused debate regarding the safety of wildfowl. At the edge of the lake is a \\"classic temple\\" style bandstand, surrounded by amphitheatre style seating. This was specifically located to use the acoustics of sound travelling across the lake. The bandstand was also designed by Mawson and was opened on 1 July 1929. It features an Entablature and has a copper roof. The nearby steps are intended to seat an audience of 2,500 people. Near the lake, there is \\"trim trail\\" facility which provides outdoor exercise equipment. In 1927, the lake was covered by of ice which the council embraced and lit the area for late night ice-skating. =Cocker clock tower= Approach to Cocker clock tower Mawson proposed a war memorial for the park which led to a competition by the Blackpool Corporation offering a prize of 100 guineas. The winning design was from Lionel Budden of a tall clock tower. The name was given as dedication to the first mayor of Blackpool, Dr William Cocker. Built in ashlar, each side faces almost exactly north, east, south and west with the door on the northern side The clock tower encompasses two bronze lion head drinking fountains and a medallion above an inscription. The inscription on the tower reads: It used to be possible for visitors to climb the tower for the view‚Äô until the mid-1970s. =Gardens= Aside from the Italian gardens there is a rose garden which has two circular man-made ponds with fountains. The rose gardens are surrounded by the hedging of the bowling greens =Tearoom and tennis pavilion= In a bungalow style of the inter-war era the building has had multiple uses such as facilitating tennis equipment hire and as a tearoom. The building is now used as a Police and Community Support Centre which is used by constables, special constables and police community support officers (PCSO's). =Visitor centre= The Visitors' centre opened in August 2005 by the 19th Earl of Derby. It was a result of ¬£100,000 investment from the National Lottery Fund and has provided an office for the Friends of Stanley Park who have now taken over the management of the building =Conservatory= Originally there were of conservatories but this was replaced by a aluminium and glass structure in the 1970s. The glasshouses grew the plants for Blackpools parks and had three sections (temperate, tropical and potted plants). This was previously run in partnership with Myerscough College but due to financial constraints their support was withdrawn in 2009/2010. Soon after, the building was deemed structurally unsafe, in part due to vandalism, and therefore was demolished in 2012 to make way for a car park. =Children's play area= The play areas within the park have been renovated many times and currently have a ¬£110,000 animal farm themed play area which is suitable for 2-8 year olds. It has a number of attractions including: rocking horses, see saws, slides, climbing frames, swings, roundabouts, interactive surfboard, rota web, play vehicle and 3D spring ride-ons. A 30-year-old climbing frame train has been restored as part of the renovations as well as installing new seating areas. There is also a timber framed adventure playground, which was constructed in 2011 using ¬£300,000 investment, for older children. Sport =Original provisions= View across the bowling greens The tennis courts were in use before the official opening of the park, as early as 1924 and were reported to have 24 hard and 16 grass courts. Again, the bowling greens were in use before the official opening of the park, as early as 1924 The park hosts six bowling greens: four crown and two flat. There are a number of buildings associated with the greens such as the Bowling Club House, Flat Green Bowling Club and Crown Green Booking Office, changing rooms, public toilets and two bowling green shelters. The greens are regularly used by the Blackpool Bowling Club =Subsequent additions= Constructed in 1987, and updated in 2008, the all- weather pitches host a number of sports including five-a-side football, hockey and basketball matches. For hockey, there are three astroturf pitches and two grass pitches at the park. The Blackpool Hockey Club are based at Stanley Park and they have three senior men's teams, three senior women's teams, and one junior boys team. In 2008 the club gained the England Hockey's ClubsFirst accreditation. There is an annual Blackpool Hockey Festival held on the sports pitches which has been at Stanley Park since it was organised by Warrington banker manager, George Greaves, in 1952. The park has space and facilities to support football and rugby matches on grass fields In 2011 a national standard BMX track was opened at Stanley Park. The track is home to a local club: Blackpool BMX club which has members who have won competitions at international level. The club was given funding from funded by Blackpool Council, British Cycling, NHS Blackpool and Cycling England. Dylan Clayton, a bronze medal world champion, assisted with training and publicising BMX riding to local schools The park also has two putting greens, miniature golf, table tennis, trampolines and a skate park for visitor use. =Athletics arena= The Athletics track at Stanley Park Blackpool The oval cinder track built in the 1960s was upgraded in 1987 to a synthetic track with floodlights. The arena houses an \\"eight-lane outdoor synthetic track, 6 lane indoor synthetic track, full range of field event facilities, UK Athletics-qualified coaches, covered stand with seating for over 300 spectators, Clubhouse and changing rooms with disabled provisions\\". The arena is regularly used by local schools on summer sports days. Blackpool F.C., the town's professional football club, had its home at the athletic grounds on the same site between 1897 and 1899, prior to moving to its current Bloomfield Road address.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992 Blackpool, Wyre and Fylde Athletic Club has a club house at the track. They offer training and competitions in track and field, cross country, and road relays. =Cricket ground= The cricket ground was in place before the development of Stanley Park but was remodelled as part of the plans and was previously known as the Whitegate Park The Whitegate park had encompassed a horse racing track, football field and cricket ground but by the early 1920s the Whitegate site no longer hosted other sports therefore it was decided the site would be dedicated to Blackpool Cricket Club. Due to being within the boundary, it was renamed Stanley Park in 1925. In 1925 a ¬£4,500 brick pavilion was built and coincidentally the wooden one was destroyed by fire in the same year. Sir Lindsay Parkinson donated the ground, valued at ¬£10,000 to the club shortly before it was renamed Stanley Park. The ground is managed by Blackpool Cricket Club and the deeds are held in trust by the mayor. 1935 saw a ladies pavilion and an extension built to the existing stand in an attempt to encourage more county games to be held at the ground. During the war, the RAF used the grounds for training though games were still played there. County games continued from 1946 until 1984 in which time Lancashire suffered their first defeat at the ground. The original wooden seating has been replaced by concrete bankings and plastic seats; the changing rooms and the facade of the pavilion has been updated. The facility has seating for 5000 visitors and covers 34,714 square yards. It continues to facilitate local and county games The competitive hobby of slot car racing has a group based in the scout huts at the Cricket Ground. =Golf course= At the time of opening in 1926, it was perceived that golf was necessary for any resort which wished to attract middle class visitors. Alister MacKenzie designed the golf course for the park and he reported that the he was originally given to plan was not sufficient for the quality course he would have liked. Therefore, the council purchased a further and he was then able to plan the 18 hole course that exists today. A clubhouse was added in 1935; prior to this the art deco cafe (pavilion building) served as the golf house. =Blackpool Sports Centre= On the site of the park nurseries, the Blackpool Sports Centre was built in 1996. The sports hall is able to host many sports including badminton, table tennis and 5-a-side football as well as a indoor running track. There is an indoor climbing wall, a bouldering room and studios for fitness, exercise classes and spinning. There are 4 outdoor all-weather pitches and 6 netball courts. =Running= A parkrun takes place in the park every Saturday morning. Stanley Park conservation area There are two conservation areas within Blackpool; one around the Town Hall and the other around Stanley Park. The conservation area includes Stanley Park's bordering houses. =Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes= The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes is a chapel within the Stanley Park conservation area and was built in 1955‚Äì7. The shrine is situated on Whinney Heys Road, Blackpool. It was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Historic Chapels Trust. Locally it has been known as the \\"white church\\". Attractions Stanley Park is home to several attractions, including the Miniature Golf course and Model Village. =Model Village= In the 1960s a private investor opened a miniature building attraction which is set within of gardens. There are a range of miniature models ranging from castles to many types of small villages. In 2011, lead was stolen from the roof tiles on the miniature houses and the owners reported that hand-made figures were often stolen. Events Stanley Park hosts a classic car show The Friends of Stanley Park host a variety of events at the park throughout the year including music concerts at the bandstand and vehicle events in the Italian Gardens. *In 1928, Blackpool Stanley Park first hosted the L.M.S railway Northern District Horticultural society show. The show, patronised by the Earl of Lonsdale, continued annually and attracted 5,000 entries in 1933 and in 1937 there were 3,500 exhibits with over 10,000 people attending the event. To accommodate the large number of visitors, special trains were put on, to transport people from across northern England including Shropshire and Yorkshire. *In 1932, 2000 people battled a thunderstorm to witness the Blackburn's Steelworks Band perform at the bandstand in the park. *In 1939, the parks committee allowed annual shows for the Blackpool horse, pony and sheepdog society and the Marton, Blackpool and district agricultural and horticultural society to be held at the park due to their usual venue (Squires Gate) being used by the Air Ministry. The horticultural society attracted over 2000 entries to the show. *In 1950, the park hosted the British Showjumping Association's National Championships with a prize of ¬£7,000. *In 1951, the park hosted the 'News Chronicles' second 'stage and radio garden party' in which 300 artists performed. *1952 saw the first annual Easter hockey festival held at Stanley Park. *In 2009, Stanley Park hosted Disability Sport Events, Nationwide Junior Athletics Championships. *In 2009, the park hosted start of the 4th stage of the Tour of Britain. Ecology Grey herons nesting over Stanley Park boating lake The northern island within the lake has, since 1993, held Lancashire County Biological Heritage Site status due to its heron nesting population. In 1993, there were seven active nests which increased to 43 in 2007. A variety of other birds can be sighted at the park including; the treecreeper, nuthatch, great spotted woodpecker, garden birds such as the great tit, the blue tit, the robin, recently, a near-pandemonium of rose- ringed parakeets (not normally indigenous to Blackpool) and tawny owls. Waterfowl, such as mute swans, great crested grebes, geese, moorhens, tufted ducks, shovelers and coots are also regularly sighted at the park. More recent addition to the park Blackpool's Countryside Experience, which includes Salisbury Woodland, Heron's Reach and Marton Mere Local Nature Reserve allows plants and animals to transverse between sites. The park has many native and non- native trees including the common oak, ash, willow, sycamore, holly and hawthorn. In 2003, an outbreak of Dutch elm disease resulted in the removal of elm trees within the park. Stanley Park is home to many mammals such as grey squirrels, hedgehogs and foxes. Accessibility The park has sixteen entrances including the main entrance which is accessible for vehicles. There are free car parks and on-street parking surrounding the park. Cyclists, pushchairs and disabled visitors have been catered for and all the buildings are accessible via ramps and dropped kerbs. There is only one road which has access within the park perimeter (Mawson Drive) which leads to a parking area with easy access to the art deco cafe and visitor centre Other Blackpool natural spaces *Bispham Rock Gardens *George Bancroft Park, Blackpool *Kincraig Lake Ecological Reserve *Kingscote Park, Blackpool *Moor Park, Blackpool *Salisbury Woodland Gardens, Blackpool References External links *Friends of Stanley Park ‚Äì Information and fundraising activities *Chronology & History of Blackpool, the Fylde, and South Wyre - Nick Moore Category:Parks and commons in Blackpool ","title":"Stanley Park, Blackpool"},{"id":"44573752","text":"Liv i luckan med julkalendern (\\"Action with the Christmas Calendar\\"), also known as Julkl√•dan (\\"Christmas Itch\\"), was the Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar in 1988.

It is a gray-colored lizard spotted with brown markings. It is arboreal, usually found positioned on tree bark on branches in the canopies of forest trees, where in some areas of Puerto Rico it can be incredibly abundant, with tens of thousands of the lizards being present per hectare. It is locally known as the lagartijo manchando in Puerto Rico. Names which have been coined for it in English are spotted anole, Puerto Rican spotted anole (in Puerto Rico), banded anole (in Puerto Rico), saddled anole, salmon lizard, barred anole, St. Thomas anole or the somewhat of a misnomer chameleon, because it can change color. It is known as the \\"spotted anole\\" because of the black markings on its back; the Spanish word manchado means as much. There are no salmon in Puerto Rico; the name \\"salmon lizard\\" may have been invented for tourists in 2007 by Alan Mowbray, 'interpretive media writer' for the website of El Yunque National Forest, referring to the trout- like colour pattern of its flanks or the perhaps his interpretation of the color of the skin. The names \\"saddled anole\\" and \\"barred anole\\" are likely taken from the 1862 description by Edward Drinker Cope, although it is not really true, Cope believed that the lizards were characteristically saddled with brown transverse bars on their back. The name \\"banded anole\\" may also refer to that. \\"St. Thomas anole\\" is also from Cope; although he was immediately corrected in a 1862 Danish publication, in his original English- language publication he stated the anole was only found on the island of St. Thomas. Taxonomy This species of lizard, along with many other reptiles, was first studied by the Danish apothecary Albert Heinrich Riise who in 1838 had moved to town of Taphus (which means 'bar', owing to the amount of rum produced and served there) on Sankt Thomas Island in the Danish West Indies to eventually open a pharmacy and distillery of medicinal rums and bitters. Riise, successful in this endeavour, was also extremely interested in the natural history of his surroundings, and by the 1840s had begun to ship ample specimens of plants and animals to Copenhagen, and many also found their way elsewhere throughout Europe and the young United States. In Copenhagen the zoologists Johannes Theodor Reinhardt and Christian Frederik L√ºtken had begun work on a great monograph, eventually some 200 pages excluding illustrations, on the amphibians and reptiles of the Danish West Indies and the wider Caribbean, much of it based on the extensive collections of Riise. Riise had collected numerous specimens of this lizard from the islands of St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Vieques, Tortola and Jost van Dyke, which Reinhardt and L√ºtken had described as Anolis dorsomaculatus, and named as such numerous specimens that had already been distributed to museums throughout Europe and the Americas. Unfortunately for them however, just before they were set to publish their work, the young American Edward Drinker Cope, an industrious man, hungry for recognition, who had been given a job cataloguing the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, had also set upon the Riise specimens (Cope consistently misspells his name as R√ºse throughout his article) and rushed to describe the new species for posterity himself, publishing his work a week or two earlier than them, which necessitated a rush of last minute changes to their manuscript in the days before it could be brought to the printers. The rather summary article by Cope is dated to 1861, although it was actually published in the beginning of February 1862, and Reinhardt and L√ºtken published their work on 14 February 1862, with numerous revisions to accommodate and correct Cope. Cope only published that the species was to be found on Sankt Thomas, not having known or studied the entirety of Riise's collections, and only examining a handful of specimens to be found in nearby US institutions, all of which happened to have been collected on that island. Cope misspelled, or perhaps the typesetter of the printer, or editor of the journal his description was published in, misspelled, the Latin name as striatulus; this was subsequently corrected by Reinhardt and L√ºtken. These two authors also appended some two pages of anatomical corrections and extra details to Cope's original description. For the next century and a half the taxonomy remained stable and uncontroversial, but in 1986 Craig Guyer and Jay M. Savage attempted to split the very large genus Anolis based on skeletal, immunology and karyological datasets used together in a type of cladistics method called \\"successive weighted characters\\", thus moving most species into a new very large genus called Norops. Following Guyer and Savage, Albert Schwartz and Robert W. Henderson reclassified this species as Ctenonotus stratulus in 1988, moving the species to a new genus advocated by Guyer and Savage in 1986. Because this splitting caused the new remaining genera to be paraphyletic, In 2012 the same authors, Guyer and Savage, together with Kirsten Nicholson and Brian Crother, gave Ctenonotus another go, although soon after, in 2013, other taxonomists again pointed out flaws in this approach. In 2018 Nicholson et al. again reiterated that the species should be moved to Ctenonotus. At least in 2007 the Integrated Taxonomic Information System recognised the species in the genus Ctenonotus, but this database recognises it in Anolis as of 2020. The Reptile Database has also maintained recognition of it within the genus Anolis as of 2020. =Higher classification= A. stratulus has been classified as a member of a \\"cristatellus series\\" along with A. acutus, A. cristatellus, A. cooki, A. desechensis, A. ernestwilliamsi, A. evermanni, A. gundlachi, A. krugi, A. monensis, A. poncensis, A. pulchellus and A. scriptus; all native to Puerto Rico and neighbouring islands. =Etymology= Cope states that the etymology of the specific epithet, stratulus, which he chose for this lizard in his 1862 description of the species, was derived from the diminutive of the Latin language word stratus, which he states he chose for its meaning of 'saddled' (the word can have many meanings).https://books.google.nl/books?id=jO8sAAAAYAAJ&pg;=RA1-SA2-PA230&lpg;=RA1-SA2-PA230&dq;=saddle+stratus&source;=bl&ots;=WlZ1aGXNnO&sig;=ACfU3U3yQH2z9sLiTUgTbQpvWhs_1BdvEg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjnqPzp197nAhURzaQKHTl9DQUQ6AEwEHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=saddle%20stratus&f;=false \\"A saddled horse: equus stratus\\" Cope chooses the descriptive name 'saddled' because according to him the species has four characteristic dark brown transverse bars across its back, and another across its tail. Cope had access to limited specimens, and perhaps those he examined had these markings, but in the description published by Reinhardt and L√ºtken, they state that this pattern is often not apparent, especially in specimens where the dark brown spots dominate (their description is more like that below, a number of brown, transverse tracks or bands running down the back, paired with a series of brown spots on its flanks). Description Individual in Puerto Rico This species of anole is a small lizard (or moderately-sized for an anole), adults measuring from snout to vent in males, in females to . The male does not have a dorsal crest or tail fin which is common in many of the anole lizards of Puerto Rico. The species' range of color is from gray to brownish gray. It has a pale colored, hour-glass shaped spots from the nape of its neck to its tail, and also has a black, crescent-shaped patch behind the eye. It has distinct black or darker markings running down the nape of its neck and its back, which are more noticeable on males. Its flanks are marked with small dark spots. The throat of this anole has raised brown ridges and the dewlap color is orange with light yellow scales, or \\"bright orange and yellow toward the margins\\". The dewlap is rather large. The tail is slightly compressed, with the eight or nine vertical rows of weakly keeled scales being arranged in a clearly whorled or verticillate pattern, and the upper margin (edge) of the tail being strongly toothed. The tail measures in length. In females the dewlap much smaller than it is in the male, and it is colored gray, with some pale orange in the centre near the throat. Unlike in many other anoles, in this species the juveniles have the same coloration and color patterns as do the adults. Reinhardt and L√ºtken provide a comparison table of anatomical dimensions of the males and females, with the females being slightly smaller in all measured characteristics according to them (although see above). It has four or five rows of loreal scales. There are zero to one scales between the supraorbital ridges, and one to three scales between the interparietal and supraorbital semicircular area. There are six postrostral scales, six postmental scales, and the subocular scales are in broad contact with the supralabial scales. The supradigital scales only have a single keel (are unicarinate). =Similar species= Juveniles may be confused with those of Anolis evermanni in situ. Adults of A. evermanni are emerald green, but the juveniles of this species have the same cryptic coloration as this species. The juveniles of these two species can be distinguished by the colors of the head and neck. These are uniformly gray in this species, but in A. evermanni are greenish gray. In his original description of 1862 Cope considered this species to be most similar to A. alligator, based mostly on the shape of the head, which is now in modern times is considered a synonym of A. roquet and is not considered particularly closely related to this species at all. On the other hand Reinhardt and L√ºtken find it most similar to the also Puerto Rican A. pulchellus in its dewlap, and they also compare it to juvenile A. cristatellus, but mention that this species can be distinguished by the darker backsides, and a longer, differently shaped head; both these species are now indeed thought to be closely related to A. stratulus. As with all anoles, the pattern of scales on the head are diagnostic. Distribution This species has one of the widest natural distributions of all the anoles of Puerto Rico and this range includes the many islands surrounding it such a Vieques and Culebra. In Puerto Rico it is commonly found in the Maricao State Forest, the Gu√°nica State Forest, and the Luquillo Mountains. It has been described as \\"very common\\" in Los Tres Picachos State Forest where it is more common than the \\"common anole\\", Anolis cristatellus. It is the most abundant anole at mid-elevations in Puerto Rico. It is less common in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico. It is also present in Cayo Santiago (Humacao) and Isla Pi√±eros. On the islet of Cayo Santiago and the nearby southern coastal regions of Puerto Rico, such as the city of Ponce, it is also less common than A. cristatellus. The barred anole is also found, but to a lesser extent, in the coffee plantations of the barrios of Sabana Grande, Vivi Arriba, and Mameye. It is also seen in the municipality of Utuado, and in the barrios of Cialito and Pozas in Ciales. Outside of Puerto Rico the species can be found in the British Virgin Islands, where it has been recorded on Anegada, Beef Island, Fallen Jerusalem Island, Ginger Island, Great Camanoe, Great Thatch, Guana Island, Jost van Dyke, Little Jost Van Dyke, Little Thatch, Marina Cay, Mosquito Island, Necker Island, Norman Island, Peter Island, Prickly Pear Island, Saba Rock, Salt Island, Scrub Island, Tortola and Virgin Gorda. It is a commonly observed animal in the northern United States Virgin Islands, specifically the north side of St. Thomas. It has furthermore been recorded on Bovoni Cay, Cas Cay, Congo Cay, Flanagan Island, Great St. James, Inner Brass, Leduck Island, Little St. James, Lovango Cay, Mingo Cay, Outer Brass, Patricia Cay, Prickly Pear Cay, Saba Island, Savana Island, St. John, Stephen Cay Thatch Cay, Trunk Cay, Water Island and Whistling Cay. It does not occur on the largest island of the territory, Saint Croix to the south. Ecology =Habitat= This lizard is a \\"trunk-crown ecomorph\\" (or a \\"trunk-crown dwarf\\") arboreal anole that is mostly observed on tree trunks, in the canopies, and occasionally in grasses. It is most frequently found on trees from to the canopy, where it seems to be most abundant. The species can be seen in both shaded and sunny areas, although compared to A. cristatellus, where they occur together, it is more often found in shaded areas. It is especially common in along roadsides and trails in forests. It prefers xerophytic and mesophytic environments rather than wet forests with a high level of precipitation. This anole has an altitude range from sea level to , although it has been recorded up to in Los Tres Picachos State Forest, up to northwest of Lares, Puerto Rico, or even . The anoles of this species which are found in the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico generally occupy the tabonuco, Dacryodes excelsa, tree canopy, which range from 10 to 20 meters in height from the ground. Despite their incredibly vast numbers here, the lizards may be difficult to see for visitors to the forests, because they live high up in the canopy and are camouflaged. After hurricanes which may periodically strafe this region and tear down much of the canopy, leaving the forests with mostly upright but completely denuded trees, these lizards are then seen in great abundance because they then live amongst the fallen branches and foliage, which can be up to five meters thick. On the terrain of the large navy base of Sabana Seca on the northern coast of Puerto Rico (as of 2020 still owned by the navy, but closed in 2003, like almost all of the many large bases the US military used to occupy on the island) this species is abundant in all the forested habitats of the area -the mangrove forests, wooded karst hilltops and valleys, and the high, seasonally semi-flooded palo de pollo forests of Pterocarpus officinalis. =Behaviour= It is oviparous (egg-laying). It can change color. The color pattern of spots and markings makes it well-camouflaged against the lichen-spotted tree bark on which it commonly resides. The lizard prefers smaller branches and individuals have a small range, only venturing around a territory of no more than 6 meters for foraging and mating. This species has a population turnover of 1.4 years. It is diurnal. It is not shy, especially the males, and they let humans come quite close -showing their dewlap as an observer approaches. =Interactions with other species= In some regions, such as El Yunque National Forest, A. cristatellus occurs together with up to seven other species of anole which are able to occur sympatrically with it because each species occupies a different ecological niche. In the Los Tres Picachos State Forest it occurs together with A. cristatellus, A. cuvieri, A. evermanni, A. gundlachi, A. krugi, A. occultus and A. pulchellus. Besides A. pulchellus, these other seven anoles often occur together throughout Puerto Rico. Diet A. stratulus has a diet consisting of mainly ants, but also consumes other insects such as beetles and flies, as well as land snails and spiders. It has been found to eat more during the rainy season than during the dry season. On the Guana Island a male lizard was observed to climb into a flowering Pedilanthus tithymaloides, where for a period of over ten minutes it proceeded to lap up the droplets sweet nectar being extruded from the red flowers of this plant. Parasites In its native Puerto Rico, individuals of this species may sometimes contract a type of anole malaria, Plasmodium azurophilum, a unicellular eukaryotic parasite that infects both the white and red blood cells of its victims, and which is thought to be contracted from infected mosquitoes. The disease commonly afflicts another anole species which occurs in the same forests, A. gundlachi, with usually around 30% of that species being infected as opposed to under 1% for A. stratulus. Conservation This is a very common species in many parts of Puerto Rico, where it may occur at densities of thousands to tens of thousands per acre. One estimate puts it at 21,500 per hectare (which one website calculated as 46,000 per acre, and then reconverted to 23,000 per hectare). The IUCN has not evaluated this species' conservation status.

She is a multidisciplinary artist working in various disciplines including sculpture, architecture, video and drawings. In order to demonstrate the relations between the reviled and the hidden forces working within society and culture, she has developed an installation platform based on the back-stage front-stage structure of the theatrical stage as one, which brings together simultaneously both the real and the symbolic. Helfman exhibited in numerous international exhibitions, including the 50th Biennale di Venezia, San Francisco's Institute of Visual Art, Fondazione Sandretto in Torino and the Institute of Visual Arts in the University of Wisconsin. She is currently a faculty member at the BFA and MFA programs of Bezalel Academy.  Career  Tiesto (2000) was an exhibition shown in Sommer Contemporary Art in Tel Aviv. The show was named for a Dutch DJ well known in the international club scene. The gallery space is divided into three separate rooms, each of which relates to a different section of a dance club. The middle room, which visitors enter first, is done up as a sort of lounge, to the right is a darkened room showing a documentary video about laughing gas; and along the wall in the room on the left are faces, seemingly those of dances who have stopped for a moment to have a souvenir picture taken. The third room with plastic bags folded and glued into Plexiglas which were dysmorphic images of club goes, smiling for camera. In 2005 Michal Helfman represented Israeli in the 50th Venice Biennale. Helfman‚Äôs installation was titled The Owl (2003), or ‚ÄúKochav Yair‚Äù in Hebrew. In the middle of the room stands a metallic owl surrounded with mirrors in the form of dripping water. The mutual reflection creates a kaleidoscope effect. Above the owl there is a lighting fixture designed to look like an owl‚Äôs eye. For few minutes it will radiant with a strong, bright light that will almost blinds whoever enters the room, and then, for few minute the strong light will shut down and the owl will tell stories of wisdom. Michal Helfman juxtaposes an owl, the mysterious nocturnal bird that is an ancient Greek symbol of wisdom, with the glamorous nightclub world. Helfman‚Äôs owl, which she has fashioned in the style of the twentieth- century Israeli ‚ÄúCanaanite‚Äù movement, resembles a prehistoric fertility figure, are composed of a textured medium that mimics the pink Nubian sandstone of which Nimrod (Itzhak Danzinger, 1939) In the background Roy ‚ÄúChicky‚Äù Arad reads his poem ‚ÄúThe Owl,‚Äù a work that underscores the tension between the magnificent traditions of the ancient world and the false glitter of today‚Äôs consumer society. In her installation Just Be Good to Me (2007) exhibited at The Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 2007, Helfman employed multiple disciplines and media, such us architecture, interior design, sculpture and drawing. The opening scene of the film, which was screened in the first room of the exhibition, shows Helfman herself dressed as a dancer (a variation of Edgar Degas' ballerinas) diapering her son in a nursing room as a life-size model in the midst of the desert. As the camera retreats, we see that what we thought was a house is in fact only a stage set in the middle of a desert landscape. The film takes place in the desert and may be characterized with reference to several genres: documentation of action, a family film, a video clip or an excerpt from a full-length feature film. The camera stays where it is, night falls gradually and unevenly, and the nightlight that formed part of the stage scenery is not the desert‚Äôs only source of illumination -- a lonely domestic light glowing in a vast open space. The camera moves skywards and the bright stars change into the dazzling globes we saw earlier, before being transformed into the balls of the mobile the baby was playing with at the beginning of the movie, which now starts all over again -- and so the cycle continues. In the background the 1980s pop song \\"Just Be Good to Me\\" is playing. Helfman immerses the viewer in the complex relationships between man and environment, space and action.[4] In 2013, Helfman was commissioned by the CCA Tel Aviv to create a site-specific installation titled Change. The large- scale piece was composed of sculpture, painting, drawing and video and touched on themes such as: migration, generational repetition and disillusionment. The show later installed in New York in 2015, where Helfman had her first solo show in the city.[2][6]  Approach  The film takes place in the desert and may be characterized with reference to several genres: documentation of action, a family film, a video clip or an excerpt from a full-length feature film. The refrain \\"Just be good to me\\" becomes this primal cry of a human being who depends on a relationship. The moment in which the mother and son disappear into the desert night, illustrates this mutual request. The artist transforms an image into an icon, in a symbol of dualism that exists between nature and culture, appearance and reality, single and collective. Between illusion, fiction and reality, Helfman immerses the viewer in the complex relationships between man and environment, space and action. Often collaborating with senior Israeli choreographers, dancers, gymnasts, and musicians, as part of her longtime research on the potential relations between the physical and the visual, Helfman's works constantly challenge the perception of space and movement.

It was constructed between 1932 and 1956. History Cardinal Jean Verdier at the foundation ceremony of the future Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal Church in Paris in 1933 The √âglise Sainte-Jeanne-de- Chantal is located on the grounds of some old fortifications. The population of the Paris neighborhood of the Porte de Saint-Cloud was growing fast in the 1920s, and a new church was needed. A Parisian woman from the area made a significant donation to help with the construction before she entered the convent of the Order of the Visitation, founded by Fran√ßois de Sales and Jeanne de Chantal. The architect Julien Barbier (1869‚Äì1939) was made responsible for the construction. The first stone was laid in 1932. The √âglise Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal was near to the Renault factories, and was bombed by the allies during World War II (1939‚Äì45). After the liberation of Paris construction resumed as part of the Chantiers du Cardinal program. Some changes were made to the design. The nave was enlarged and the dome flattened. Construction was not complete until 1956. The building was finished in 1962. Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, Archbishop of Paris, was cur√© of the parish of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal from 1969 to 1979, when he was named Bishop of Orleans. Structure The √âglise Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal has a Byzantine style, which had become popular in Western Europe after the rediscovery of ancient Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. It features a large dome. The structure is concrete, and the walls are covered in \\"reconstituted stones\\". In 1962 Robert Juvin created a bas-relief Bienheureuse Vierge de la Merced for the facade of the church. The bell tower is separate from the church and dominates the square. The interior is spacious and has a sober elegance. The Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, in the apse, can be hidden from the nave by a large curtain. Only this chapel has figurative stained glass. The eight windows by Jacques Le Chevallier (1954) illustrate the Litany of the Virgin. The church has stations of the cross by Herv√© Quenolle (2001) and sculptures by Jean Touret (1975) and S√©bastien Touret (2004). The Tourets, father and son, undertook the liturgical furniture and much of the decoration.

According to them when tracked over time, it offers a good directional indicator of how the users health and well-being is evolving over time. The scoring engine varies considerably from one company to another, and in some cases, the scoring engine is trademarked and/or patented, such as in the case of dacadoo. Health is invisible and therefore, all health scores in use have one thing in common: they want to capture and measure health and wellness and make it visible. Overview Health is invisible and intangible. The basic premise of a health scoring concept is that what you can measure, you can manage. If you can measure health and wellness good enough as an indicator, then you can start working with it. None of the available health scores is in medical diagnosis, they're all lifestyle-products where the health score in use is to be understood as an indicator, a number that helps you to work with it. The score typically moves up or down indicating improvement, when it moves up, and vice versa. The simpler health scores available are more static in nature and provide a number based on some inputs provided. The more sophisticated health scores are dynamic and function in real-time, moving (such as exercise, nutrition, stress and sleep) change. Most health scores claim they are based on scientific data. The simpler models use one or a few models, the more sophisticated health scores claim to include a vast amount of models and person-years of clinical data. Some health scores use in addition to static questionnaires also dynamic and ongoing data, such as captured and tracked by fitness or activity trackers or applications for smartphones, For instance, exercise can be tracked automatically by using a mobile app for smartphones to track the activity, or by using fitness tracking apps or devices from the supplier of the health score solution, or by connecting popular fitness tracking apps such as RunKeeper and activity tracking devices such as Fitbit or UP Jawbone step counters, etc. In the past, available information was limited and lifestyle adjustments were largely made only once a health problem was detected, and then under the guidance of healthcare professionals. Today due partly to the availability of electronic mass media there is a trend among the population to maintain their health on their own terms. This seems to be precipitating a shift away from the reactive model of health to a more proactive approach where the individual works towards the maintenance of their wellness before problems arise. This shift in attitudes is said to have broad implications for both public health and individual companies. Improved health would logically lead to reduced healthcare costs and increase workplace productivity. A wide array of technologies are now available that allow data to be collected on various components of wellness many of them using a variant of the Health Scoring system. Devices for measuring physical attributes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol are also commonly used by patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, devices that can be used by healthy individuals to monitor exercise and energy expenditure are increasingly popular, and range from simple heart rate monitors or step counters to more elaborate computerized exercise machines. These tools provide data on the user‚Äôs performance and many can upload the data to further systems to be processed. Undoubtedly, the largest growth area has been in apps, facilitated by the widespread use of tablets and smartphones. Although some of these apps may be gimmicks, many are said to be validated genuine tools to assist in improving health and wellness. Some of the Health Score using companies such as Fitocracy have grown to over one million users or more by focusing progress based on what's known as gamification as well as by celebrity exposure with the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger promoting their products.  Criticism The large majority of offerings with health scores is in the lifestyle segment and not in medical diagnosis, therefore prospective clinical trials to scientifically prove whether a score is accurate or not, are often missing. A single integer measuring wellness and health outcomes is subject to many unknown variables and incomplete data.

History Emerson Shephard had originally opened a shop on Swinburn Street, Gateshead but in 1908 moved to the Ellison Street. The store initially sold shoes and boots but quickly grew to become a department store. By 1924 the business had grown, with 10 branches dotted across the North East. One of those branches in North Shields had been the department store of George Swann; however, he had overstretched himself while building his new store and Shephards took over the business. In 1934 the Ellison Street, Gatehead store was given a makeover in 1934 which included three new floors and now had 30 departments. The store remained undamaged during the Second World War, but in 1946 the store was burnt to the ground. While the store was being rebuilt, Shephards relocated to Kent House, the former home of the Snowballs department store. In 1949 the new store was opened, and included the famous Panorama Restaurant. During the 1970s Shephards ran a TV advert on local TV with the catchy jingle: Shephards of Gateshead, the biggest and the best store Shephards of Gateshead have what you're looking for There's so much to see, and the car park is free Come shopping at Shephards for the whole family However the 1970s were financially damaging and by 1980 the Shephards business had closed. Shephards Gatehead store was purchased by Tesco who created Tesco Shopping City, where store space was rented out to other retailers. This was not a successful venture, especially after the opening of the Metrocentre in 1986, and subsequently closed.

Prior to that, he was one of the first staffers hired by Hagan to work on her successful 2008 U.S. Senate campaign. Prior to his work with Hagan, Sgro worked in the Washington, D.C. headquarters for America Votes, a 501 (c)4 organization that aims to coordinate and promote progressive issues, and CARE, a national anti-poverty organization. Additionally, Sgro managed Don Vaughan‚Äôs successful N.C. Senate campaign in 2008.

Sgro lives in Greensboro, North Carolina and is married to Ryan Butler. Sgro met his husband, in a gay and lesbian documentary class, while an undergraduate at American University. The couple had a marriage ceremony in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2006, but became legally married in North Carolina on October 10, 2014, where they were the second same-sex couple to receive a marriage license in Guilford County, North Carolina. North Carolina General Assembly In 2016, Sgro was selected by Democrats in Guilford County to fill a vacancy in the North Carolina House of Representatives due by the death of Ralph C. Johnson.WGHP/Fox 8: Leader of LGBT rights organization named to state Legislature Because the vacancy was created in a democratically held district, North Carolina law required the Governor to appoint the choice of local democrats. Therefore Governor Pat McCrory officially appointed Sgro to the North Carolina House of Representatives on April 14, 2016, as required by law. He became the first out LGBT person in North Carolina history to be appointed to fill a vacancy in that state's legislature and the first person to serve in North Carolina's legislature who is legally married to a person of same gender.

House Bill 2 Sgro has been one of the most vocal opponents of North Carolina's HB2, a controversial North Carolina law which he has called \\"the worst anti-LGBT legislation in the nation.\\" Less than a week after HB2 was passed Sgro held a press conference with other equality groups to announce that Equality NC had filed a federal lawsuit against HB2. After the passage of HB2, businesses, musicians, and sports leagues reacted swiftly. The NBA canceled the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte. Celebrities and musicians like Bruce Springsteen pulled out of scheduled events. Companies like PayPal and Deutsche Bank canceled expansion plans in North Carolina. After the NBA canceled the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte, Sgro encountered McCrory as he was walking into a press conference. McCrory shouted at Sgro \\"congrats, you got what you wanted.\\" Sgro responded ‚Äúactually, Governor, we all lost - because of you.‚Äù Sgro often publicly clashed with former Republican Governor Pat McCrory over the impact of House Bill 2, demanding its full repeal. On May 11, 2016 Sgro introduced the Equality for All Act, House Bill 1078. The legislation was the most comprehensive set of non-discrimination protections ever introduced in the North Carolina General Assembly. Although it never became law, the bill made national news and brought significant attention to what could be done to advance protections for minorities in North Carolina.

It was initially practiced by the ruling dynasties and was soon followed up by the chiefs, merchants, feudatories, etc. Brahmadeya was devised by the Brahmanical texts as the surest mean to achieve merit and destroy sin. Overview Brahmadeya represented the grant of land either in a single plot or whole villages donated to Brahmanas by making them land-owners or land- controllers. It was also given to more than one Brahmana (ekabhoga), to several Brahmana families (ganabhogam) which is estimated to be from few to several hundreds or even more than thousands, particularly in the South India. The gift of land were mostly selected around the irrigation facilities such as tanks or lakes and were supposed to be operable to fulfill the needs of the donees. In the absence of facility, new means of irrigation system were created near the brahmadeyas. The Kings and feudatories were to lose their right over donated lands and could not take it back even in the absence of heir. In the absence of heir, brahamdeya was transferred to some other eligible person of the same caste. Though, mostly lands, other objects such as food, grains, paddy, gold, money, cow, oxen, ploughshare, etc. were also given away as a gift. Brahmadeyas, however helped to bring virgin land under cultivation and to integrate the existing rural settlement into a new economic order, dominated by the Brahmanas proprietor. They were exempted from various land taxes and dues either entirely or partially such as in the initial states of settlement. The taxes from the donated villages were assigned to Brahmana donees. Brahamdeyas also helped the ruling families as they did gain the ideological support for their political power. It is said to be a chief characteristic of the Indian feudalism. The donation of land sometimes represented more than just the transfer of land rights. At many instances, human resources such as peasants, artisans and others along with revenues and economic resources were also transferred to the donees. There are several inscriptional evidence of conflicts between peasants, Brahmanas, and doners arising out of alienation of rights. Among other conflicting issues, right over drawing water was the most sensitive issue. An inscription dated back to 1080 CE belonging to the Hasan Taluk mentions a water dispute between a Brahmana and a farmer's family. Another inscription from the same taluk of 1230 CE. evidences the death of two farmers over land right issue. Peasants were sometimes forced to agree conversion of their land into brahamdeya by denying water to them. In the brahmadeya villages, villagers were landless labours who were paid a portion of crop they helped to cultivate.  History  In the Deccan region, specifically present-day Maharashtra, Buddhist establishments are known to have received land grants during Satavahana rule since as early as 1st century CE. The historical evidence of the practice of donating lands to Brahmanas in return of spiritual favour is traced back to 3rd-4th century CE in South India. The earliest royal land grant inscription that mentions the word \\"brahmadeya\\" is discovered from the 3rd century CE of the reign of Brihatphala yana King Jayavarman. Brahmadeya soon developed into a systematic attempt to avail subsistence to Brahmanas and a common practice onward 4th century CE. The registration of donated land that included cultivable land, garden, residential plot were recommended by the Smrities and Puranas of the post-Gupta period and were recorded on the copper plates. The tradition of land grants through the history of practice took the shape of a legal form governed by the law book called, Dharma≈õƒÅstra. The Anushasana Parva, a part of the great epic Mahabharata has a complete chapter dedicated to Bhumi-dana-prasamsa, commending the gifts of land. The Vakataka rulers made several land grants to Brahmanas in present-day Maharashtra: in the 5th century, the Vakataka king Pravarasena II is known to have granted land to as many as 1,000 Brahmanas in a single district, using a single charter. The Vakataka rulers also made several land donations to Brahmanas in central and western Madhya Pradesh. Their contemporaries, including Gupta vassals, donated lands to the Brahmanas in north-eastern Madhya Pradesh during the 4th and the 5th centuries. The Chhattisgarh region was Brahmanized during the 6th and the 7th centuries under the ruler of the Nalas, the Sharabhapuriyas, and the Pandavas (of Mekala and Dakshina Kosala). The eastern Andhra region was brahmanized in the 3rd and 4th centuries during the rule of the Ikshvakus (who also patronized the Buddhists), Shalankayanas, and Vishnukundinas; the western region was brahmanized later, in the 5th century. The southern part of Karnataka came under Brahamnical influence under the Kadamba rule during the 5th and the 6th centuries, but the large-scale Brahmana settlements came to be distributed in Karnataka during the Vatapi Chalukya rule in the 6th-8th centuries. Epigraphic evidence suggests that the land grants to Brahmanas became frequent in northern Bengal and Assam in the 5th century; in the east Bengal in the 6th century; in Gujarat, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh (Kangra and Chamba), and Nepal in the 7th century. Land grant inscriptions show that in present-day Tamil Nadu, the Chola rulers introduced Brahmana settlements during the 8th century, and such settlements increased considerably during 9th-10th centuries. In present-day Kerala, large-scale land grants to Brahmanas do not occur until the 10th-11th centuries.

He worked in Antwerp, Haarlem and Amsterdam. He is regarded as one of the most faithful followers of the Dutch painter Nicolaes Berchem.Jan Frans Soolmaker at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jan Frans Soolmaker was likely born in Antwerp. He is recorded in April 1654 upon becoming a pupil of the little known Jan de Bruin in Antwerp. It appears he did not complete his studies with the Bruin but rather moved to Haarlem. Because of the similarity in style, it is believed that in Haarlem he was likely a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem. There is no record of him joining the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke. It is assumed he later joined the Amsterdam Guild. Resting horsemen by a fountain Soolmaker is recorded in December 1665 as drawing up his last will. It was the usual practice in the 17th century for people to draft their will before starting out on a perilous journey. He apparently intended to travel to Italy via Portugal. It is not clear whether he in fact set out on that journey. A signed Italian landscape dated 1668 was sold by Mak van Waay on 8 October 1973 in Amsterdam. Should that date be authentic, it has to be assumed he was still alive two years after drafting his last will. No other dated works by his hand are known. A clearly signed view of the Escorial sold at Christie's, London on 9 July 1976 could mean that he completed at least part of his intended trip and visited Spain. No Italian sources or records regarding any residence in Italy exist. The date and place of his death are not known. Work Man with donkeys Soolmaker had a relatively short career and this explains the small body of work of the artist. Aside from the Escorial painting (if not a copy after someone else‚Äôs work), no work produced outside of the Low Countries is recorded. His works imitate Berchem's style and he is sometimes regarded as one of the best imitators of Berchem. It has in fact happened in the past that art dealers have tried to pass off his work as that of Berchem sometimes by adding fake Berchem signatures. This was the case with the Travellers resting by a fountain (sold at Jean Moust Old Master Paintings aasby Soolmaker).Travellers resting by a fountain at Jean Moust Old Master Paintings The ferry Some of his works also show themes and motifs inspired by or even copied after Philips Wouwerman. This was quite common among Antwerp painters from the second half of the 17th century such as for instance Simon Johannes van Douw and various members of the van Bredael family. One of the themes borrowed from Wouwerman often recurring in his work is a father and son looking at a horseman who is about to mount a white horse. This can be seen in the Resting horsemen by a fountain (sold by Jean Moust Old Master Paintings). Another often recurring theme is the shepherds with their flock such as in the Shepherdess and a Flock of Sheep in the Hermitage Museum. Soolmaker was also a printmaker as is shown by the Man with Donkeys dated 1664 in the Rijksmuseum.Man with Donkeys at the Rijksmuseum References External links * Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:People from Antwerp Category:1635 births ","title":"Jan Frans Soolmaker"},{"id":"44574453","text":"Snowball & Son was a department store located in Gateshead.

Darnielle started work on the novel the day after completing his previous book, Master of Reality. \\"I'd been working on it so long that it felt weird not to be working on anything, so I started typing something up, and it was what became the last chapter of Wolf in White Van. I just started typing it up and it ended with a guy shooting himself and I said, 'Well, that‚Äôs not a good story.' So then I wrote a bunch of other chapters with no direction at all,\\" he said. Plot summary Sean Phillips lives with a caretaker after shooting himself in the head at age 17, causing facial disfigurement. The circumstances of the shooting are initially left ambiguous. Sean's relationship with his parents is strained as they struggle to understand why he chose to shoot himself. The novel alternates between different moments in Sean's life. He describes the reactions people have to his appearance, and the experience he has meeting people before and after the shooting. One of his friends, Kimmy, visits him in the hospital, but she is discouraged by Sean's parents who believe she convinced Sean to shoot himself. While recuperating in the hospital, Sean develops the play-by-mail role-playing game Trace Italian, from which he earns a small income. The objective of Trace Italian is to traverse a post- apocalyptic United States and locate a fortress after which the game is named‚Äîa fortress that Sean claims no player will ever penetrate. Sean describes the correspondence he has with players, in particular two teenage players who attempt to carry out the game's actions in real life. One dies and the other is injured, and Sean is charged in court by the players' parents but is not found guilty. The novel ends with Sean recalling a time before the shooting when he sneaked out with Kimmy and they kissed behind a store. That same night, Sean takes out a rifle and considers whether to shoot himself as well as his parents. He decides not to shoot his parents, then enters his room, rests the rifle against under his chin and lies on his stomach. The sentence ends with an excerpt from a fantasy. The narrative is told in a non- chronological order, with the current life of the narrator interrupted with frequent flashbacks, in a reverse chronological order.

Since there is a limit to how many bobbins can be handled on a pillow, this limits how wide the lace is. Part lace, on the other hand, is made in pieces or motifs.

The complex labyrinth of fissure corridors and caves can be found inside the calcite hill of T≈ôes√≠n. The underground spaces are decorated with stalactites, stalagmites and sinters. Its highlights include \\"Nature‚Äôs Temple\\" and the \\"Virgin Cave\\". Caves The islets of limestones in Mladeƒç Karst belong geologically to one of the belts of the Devonian rocks in the Central Moravian part of the Bohemian Massif (the Konice-Mladeƒç Devonian). These caves represent a predominantly horizontal and very broken labyrinth of corridors, domes and high chimneys with remarkable modelling of walls and ceilings, with stalactite and stalagmite decoration and with numerous block cave-ins, with some steep corridors which extend even below the level of the underground water. They are also famous for archaeological findings. The archaeologists claim that these caves have world meaning. Except for the entrance, the caves are not accessible to the public. However, the management of Mladeƒç caves frequently open for the visitors. They have a total of 1,250 metres of corridors and halls with denivelation of 30 metres. It takes visitors about 40 minutes to go through the 380 metre-long path. The minimum for the visit is a group of six visitors and there is an exhibition of photos and interesting information about the caves. These caves can be visited from April to October. Archaeology They are an important archaeological site and probably even the oldest, largest and most northern settlements of the Cro-Magnon people in Europe (Cro-Magnon lived here as long as 31 thousands years ago). Mladeƒç caves are a significant paleontological and archaeological locality. There are findings of bones of extinct Pleistocene vertebrates, a number of skeletons of people of the Early Stone Age, together with multiple objects evidencing their activities (stone instruments, fireplaces). =Excavations= Approach to the caves The existence of the caves was known as early as 1826. The main cave, Mladeƒç Cave I, was first excavated by Josef Szombathy, who recorded his visits and excavations to the cave in his diary, a diary which is the sole source of information on the early excavations at the site. Szombathy first excavated the cave on June 7, 1881. The initial excavation ended on June 12. The first human fossil, the skull of Mladeƒç 1, was discovered during this excavation. Other fossils discovered during this excavation include Mladeƒç 2, Mladeƒç 3, Mladeƒç 7, Mladeƒç 12-20 and Mladeƒç 27. Szombathy's second excavation at the cave started on July 13, 1882 and ended on July 18. He returned again and excavated the cave from August 7‚Äì12, 1882. Mladeƒç 8, Mladeƒç 9 and Mladeƒç 10 were discovered during this excavation. Szombathy named the cave F√ºrst Johann‚Äôs H√∂hle in honor of Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein, who owned the land where the cave was located. While the cave lay in the domain of the Prince of Liechtenstein, the cave also partially lay in the fields of a local villager, A. Nevrl√Ω. Thus, the parts that lay in A. Nevrl√Ω's fields were ceded to him. In 1902, A. Nevrl√Ω built a wall to separate the Liechtenstein entrance from the cave and began to excavate a new entrance to the cave. Along with Jan Knies, a local schoolteacher and amateur archaeologist, the two began to excavate the cave. Mladeƒç 39-41 and Mladeƒç 88-91 were discovered by Knies. On March 22, 1904, a second cave, the Quarry Cave (Mladeƒç Cave II) was discovered near the main site by quarry workers and subsequently destroyed. The workers found three human skulls, which were likely to have been Mladeƒç 5, Mladeƒç 6 and Mladeƒç 46. The discovery of human fossils was big news at the time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus attracted a lot of attention. The mayor of nearby Litovel, Jan Smyƒçka, arrived soon after. Szombathy returned to the site on August 25, where he was presented with the new fossil finds. In 1911, the Museum Society in Litovel took over ownership of the caves. Szombathy's next visit to the site occurred in 1925. In the intervening years, the Museum Society in Litovel, under the supervision of Jan Smyƒçka, ordered the removal of large amounts of sediment from the Mladeƒç caves without the guidance of archaeologists, destroying a lot of valuable potential information on the cave. This was done in order to make the caves accessible for public viewing; the removal of large amounts of sediment allowed for the building of stairs and paved floors for visitors to the caves. The last significant fossil finds were discovered in 1922. =Discoveries= A bone point from Mladeƒç caves, Vienna Museum of Natural History Many of the discoveries at Mladeƒç have been lost or destroyed over time, due to unauthorized looting and excavations, disappearances into private collections, and the large destruction of artefacts stored at Mikulov Castle, which was set on fire by the Germans at the end of World War II. Ironically, the anthropological collection from the Moravsk√© zemsk√© muzeum, which included a large collection of fossil artefacts from Mladeƒç, had been moved to Mikulov Castle during the war for safekeeping purposes. Out of the 60 human fossils from Mladeƒç stored at Mikulov Castle, only 5 could be recovered following the fire. Osteological and lithic artefacts were discovered at Mladeƒç. 40 bone points were discovered, while only a few stone artefacts were discovered. Mladeƒç-type bone points The bone points at Mladeƒç have been found at other Central European sites in an Aurignacian context. None of the bone points from Mladeƒç have a split base, and in fact have a massive base. These artefacts are referred to as Mladeƒç- type bone points or bone projectiles. When found at other sites with split base bone points occurring in a separate layer, the layer with Mladeƒç-type bone points is always found above the layer with split base bone points. The Mladeƒç-type bone points appear in an Aurignacian context after 40,000 BP. Other artefacts Perforated pendants from Mladeƒç caves, Vienna Museum of Natural History 22 perforated mammalian teeth were also discovered; these teeth were likely used as pendants. Perforated animal teeth used as pendants are frequently found at Aurignacian sites. The perforated teeth from Mladeƒç came from wolves, bears, and uncommonly, beavers and moose. Out of the limited lithic artefacts from Mladeƒç, only one can clearly be ascribed as Aurignacian. The remains of carbonized rope were also discovered in 1882 by Szombathy. In 1981, archaeologists discovered ochre-colored marks on some of the walls at Mladeƒç. Today, the assemblage of fossils from Mladeƒç is split among several museums. Szombathy's collection is stored in the Vienna Museum of Natural History, while Jan Knies' collection is stored in the Moravsk√© zemsk√© muzeum. =Fauna= 632 bones from large mammals remain from the fossil assemblage discovered at Mladeƒç. The large mammal remains at Mladeƒç come primarily from bovids (primarily steppe bison, but a few from aurochs), bears (primarily Ursus deningeri, but a few from Ursus spelaeus), reindeer, horses and wolves. =Human fossils= More than 100 human fossil fragments were discovered at Mladeƒç. Researchers failed to extract usable DNA from the Mladeƒç human fossils for the purposes of aDNA analysis. However, two (out of twelve) of the Mladeƒç specimens, Mladeƒç 2 and Mladeƒç 25c, yielded a limited amount of mtDNA, which did not contain Neanderthal mtDNA sequences. =Dating= Direct AMS dating of the human fossils from Mladeƒç yielded uncalibrated dates of around 31,190 BP for Mladeƒç 1, 31,320 BP for Mladeƒç 2, 30,680 BP for Mladeƒç 8 and 26,330 BP for Mladeƒç 25c.

History  Find a Crew was launched in December, 2004 to match individuals who wanted to work on boats with boats needing crew. In 2009, Nautycal Pty Ltd was founded as the parent company of Find a Crew and other marine based websites. It is based in Mooloolaba, Queensland. The directors of Nautycal Pty Ltd are Raffael Gretener as the CEO and Knud Nexo as the Chief Technology Officer. In 2007, Find a Crew became a registered trademark due to being able to demonstrate that the phrase was not used as a searchable phrase prior to December 2004. It has since become a frequently used search phrase by people looking for crew or crew jobs.

It is about north of the market town of Melton Mowbray and west from Grantham. Plungar is adjacent to the Grantham Canal and stands in the Vale of Belvoir. History The Plungar name derives through the c.1130 name 'Plunard', itself from the Old English \\"plume\\" with the Old English \\"gara\\" or Old Scandinavian \\"garthr\\", meaning \\"Triangular plot where plum trees grow\\" or plum tree enclosure.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p. 370.

It extends along Main Street (marked United States Route 302 for part of its length and Maine State Route 5 for all of it), from Woodland Street in the north to Portland Street (SR 5 and Maine State Route 113) in the south, and includes forty primary buildings on . The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history Fryeburg was established in 1763 by Colonel Joseph Frye, with settlement beginning the following year, on the former site of an Abenaki village called \\"Pequawket\\". Its present village site grew around a combination of good agricultural lands and convenient access to the few roads and trails extant at the time, and was the site of its first meeting house, where the First Congregation Church (1848‚Äì50, Greek Revival) now stands. Its importance as a civic center was further solidified with the establishment in 1792 of Fryeburg Academy, some of whose buildings are within the district. The most notable of these is the main academy building, designed by Gridley J. F. Bryant and built in 1852-53 by Ammi B. Cutter, with wings designed by John Calvin Stevens added in 1930. The oldest building in the district is the Squire Chase House, built c. 1767 by Nathaniel Merrill, one of Fryeburg's first proprietors, and altered during the 19th century to give it a combination of Federal and Italianate features. The most recent building is the Catholic Church, a rambling frame structure built in 1990. With the notable exceptions of the academy buildings and a bank, all of the buildings in the district are wood frame structures, and most are residential houses. Stylistically they are somewhat diverse, reflecting Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles from late 18th and 19th century more than other styles. There is one Shingle style house, the Charles Goodnow House at 137 Main Street, built in 1895, which is one of the finest of the style in the entire county. In addition to the academy, non-residential buildings in the district include the brick c. 1822 Casco Bank and Trust building at 122 Main Street and the Burnham Jewelry Store, a frame structure built in 1903-11 which is one of the town's best-preserved commercial buildings of the period. The Congregational Church was built in 1848-50, and has a vestry built in 1837. There are two dormitory buildings of the academy that are not historically significant, and there is an old wood-frame gas station, built in 1935. Two of the district's buildings are separately listed on the National Register. These include the Chase House, noted for its association with an early settler, and the Barrows-Steadman Homestead at 134 Main Street, which has murals drawn on the walls of an upstairs chamber, attributed to itinerant artists Rufus Porter and Jonathan Poor.

Billboard. It was financed through investments Amazon.com (who along with CAA, holds a minority stake in the company), Comcast, Greylock Partners, and High Peak Ventures. The company's main headquarters are in The New York Times Building in Manhattan, with additional headquarters in CAA's office building in the Silicon Beach area of Los Angeles, and in London. The company was founded to protect celebrities' intellectual property and enable the celebrities themselves to profit themselves from their own content through copyright branding. Its chief executive is co-founder Steve Ellis, who, after leaving Getty Images, was contacted by CAA, who were looking to resolve the issue of celebrities losing the rights to their own photos and videos when uploading them to social network sites. Ellis explained WhoSay's mission thus: \\"We work with people who are constantly being utilized by third parties for the wrong reasons. [The company was formed] to give celebrities and other influential people a set of tools to allow them to manage and control their presence in the digital world.\\" In this way, WhoSay is likened by Ellis to \\"a People magazine by the people themselves who are in it.\\" WhoSay's growth was slow until actor Tom Hanks joined it three months after its launch. The company started slowly, until CAA client Tom Hanks signed onto WhoSay three months after the service's launch. The company continued to maintain a low profile for the first three years of operation, during which it accumulated a client list of 1,500 actors, musicians and artists. Clients are accepted by the service on an invitation-only basis, although they are not restricted to Creative Artists clients.

Among his responsibilities are developing ways to monetize WhoSay's web and mobile products, such as premium advertising strategies and brand partnerships. WhoSay does not allow consumers to create accounts, nor does it include search features, making it difficult to access a celebrity's account unless a user is directed there from one of their other social pages. According to Ellis, consumers have enough social media choices, saying, \\"Frankly they don't really need the services that we provide, and there are a lot of very specific features built into our service that really only benefit someone who is of a high profile.\\" By February 2015, WhoSay had amassed 4.8 million unique users, and expanded its accounts to companies that employ celebrities for branded content. Such companies include Lexus, which partnered with the company to promote a campaign in which actress Rosario Dawson, during the lead up to the 87th Academy Awards, released five short videos on her social media accounts.

He was previously on the books of Newcastle United and Carlisle United, but played for neither in the League. Life and career Henderson was born in Hexham, Northumberland, later moving to nearby Allendale. As a young boy, he was unable to walk for a year because of a paralytic illness. He began his football career as a junior with Newcastle United before signing for Carlisle United in 1950. He played for Carlisle's reserves in the North-Eastern League, but never played first-team football for them, and signed for Third Division North club Darlington in 1952. He made his senior debut for Darlington on 17 September 1952, against Carlisle United, but after Ernie Devlin arrived from West Ham United in 1953 and was named captain, he played less frequently than in his first season. When Cliff Mason's departure for Sheffield United in 1955 left a vacancy at full-back, Henderson became a permanent fixture in the position. He was a member of the Darlington team that caused an upset in the 1957‚Äì58 FA Cup by eliminating Chelsea, who had won the league title only three seasons before, to reach the last 16 of the competition. He injured his neck in the first match, in which Chelsea came back from 3‚Äì0 down at Stamford Bridge to draw 3‚Äì3, but had recovered in time for the replay four days later at Darlington's Feethams ground. The score after 90 minutes was 1‚Äì1. In the first nine minutes of extra time, Darlington scored three times to take the match 4‚Äì1. He helped Darlington eliminate Crystal Palace and West Ham in the first two rounds of the 1960‚Äì61 League Cup before facing Bolton Wanderers, whose team contained five international players, in the third. Darlington took the lead, with a shot from Joe Rayment, Bolton equalised in the second half against the run of play with a free kick from distance, and Henderson cleared off the line from both Nat Lofthouse and Doug Holden before the latter finally scored a winner seconds from time. The attendance, of 21,023, remains a club record. He captained the club, and earned a reputation as a hard man. According to the club's historian, \\"he seemed to have no fear, a crash, bang wallop defender who'd win the ball and set attacks away\\", and he was reported to have played for six weeks with cotton wool in his boots to ease the pain from a broken ankle., quoted at On 4 January 1964, Henderson's right leg was broken in two places during a match against Stockport County. He had to be carried off the field on a canvas toolbag because his partner at full-back, Bobby Whitehead, was already occupying the only stretcher having also suffered a broken leg. Neither man played professionally again. A Darlington XI played a strong Sunderland side in a testimonial match for Henderson at the end of the season. Henderson made 463 senior appearances for Darlington over twelve-and-a-half seasons ‚Äì 423 in the Football League, 32 in the FA Cup and 8 in the League Cup ‚Äì which at the time placed him top of the club's all-time appearance list, since overtaken by Ron Greener and John Peverell. While a Darlington player, Henderson had worked in sales for the club chairman's car company. In later life he made occasional appearances in local football. He settled in Darlington, and died there in 2001 at the age of 71. He had a son, Tim, and grandchildren.

He was secretary general of the F√©d√©ration des Bourses de travail (Federation of Workers' Councils) and deputy secretary general of the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail (CGT ‚Äì General Confederation of Labour) in the period leading up to World War I (1914‚Äì18). He kept a low profile during the war, and in 1918 was dismissed from the CGT leadership. After the war he contributed to many anarchist journals. He died in poverty during World War II (1939‚Äì45). Early years Georges Louis Fran√ßois Yvetot was born in Paris on 20 July 1868 to a father of Norman origin. He was born in the Minimes barracks, where his father was a gendarme. His mother died, and then his father, while he was young. He was raised by the Brothers of Christian Doctrine and the Auteuil center for orphan apprentices, where he trained as a typographer from 1880 to 1887. He contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and was therefore not required to serve in the army. From 1887 to 1894 he worked as a typesetter for La Patrie, accepting a wage below standard. Pre-war union leader Yvetot became an anarchist under the influence of Fernand Pelloutier, whom he helped as typographer on the Ouvrier des Deux Mondes. He was working at the Petit Soir when Pelloutier died, and he succeeded him as secretary general of the F√©d√©ration des Bourses on 22 May 1901. He was appointed with the help of the socialists Jean Allemane and Paul Brousse. He was reelected in this position, under slightly different titles, by every congress until the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18). His aggressive behavior and physical appearance earned him the nickname \\"bulldog\\". He was a follower of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as an anarchist, and continued to be so after becoming a syndicalist. He was very reluctant about the F√©d√©ration des Bourses merging with the CGT at the 9th congress in Nice in September 1901. From the Montpellier Congress of the CGT in September 1902, the secretary of the Bourses section was automatically secretary of the GCT, and thus in title was second in the trade union leadership. Yvetot presented the report on the Federation or Section of the Bourses at the CGT congresses in Nice (September 1901), Algiers (September 1902), Bourges (September 1904) and Amiens (October 1906). He did not attend the Marseille congress in October 1908 since he was imprisoned. He attended the CGT congresses at Toulouse (October 1910) and Le Havre (September 1912). At these two congresses he also reported on the Voix du Peuple. Yvetot represent French trade unionism at various international conferences in the inter-war years. In December 1902 Yvetot was one of the founders of the Ligue antimilitariste, along with fellow anarchists Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and √âmile Janvion. This was to become the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA), which was the subject of intense police surveillance. The AIA was open to workers of all political leanings, including socialists, syndicalists and anarchists. Yvetot wrote in the AIA bulletin, \\"There is no need that is more urgent than antimilitarist propaganda. ... This is why, outside of political groups, outside even of economic groups, the AIA truly has its raison d'√™tre.\\" In 26-28 June 1904 the AIA held its founding congress in Amsterdam, with a 12-member delegation from France. L'Ennemi du Peuple reported that there were 4,500 attendees at the last public meeting, but this is probably an exaggeration. The congress was dominated by anarchists, but also included syndicalists and communists. The question of whether refusal of military service should be AIA strategy was hotly debated. Yvetot and Miguel Almereyda (Eug√®ne Vigo) led the French section and sat on the AIA committee. Although technically not linked to the CGT, the AIA moved its headquarters into the CGT building and had many of the same members. The CGT members did not all share Yvetot's uncompromising anti-militarism. Thus Louis Niel wrote in 1905 that, \\"In case of war, I do not believe that a general strike is possible today.\\" Niel thought it was worth fighting for liberties that had been achieved in one's country when they were threatened with destruction by a country that was more reactionary. Yvetot rejected this, stating baldly, \\"Workers can be patriotic if they have the temperament of dogs\\". At the 1906 Amiens congress of the CGT Yvetot succeeded in passing a strongly unpatriotic motion, despite resistance from the leadership. Yvetot opposed compulsory arbitration and demanded the freedom to strike. Yvetot always strongly defended the independence of trade unionism from political parties, and remained opposed to any agreement with the Socialist party. He was often arrested and convicted for his propaganda, and spent several periods in prison. Thus in 1906 Yvetot, Louis Grandidier and Gustave Herv√© were imprisoned for anti-militarist activities. Yvetot ran an organization called the Sou du Soldat (The soldier's farthing) which in theory helped young syndicalists by sending them small amounts of money when they were conscripted into the army. The police saw the organization's goal as spreading revolutionary propaganda among the troops. In the spring of 1913 conscripts demonstrated against an extension of the duration of their military service, and on 1 July 1913 Yvetot and other CGT leaders were arrested. They were released, but on 26 March 1914 were tried in absentia, and Yvetot was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 100 francs. An appeal was pending when the war broke out. On 28 July 1914 Yvetot and the syndicalist leaders L√©on Jouhaux, Georges Dumoulin and Alphonse Merrheim held meetings at the Salle Wagram where they opposed the war, and the Confederal Committee of the CGT stated that \\"In the current situation, the CGT reminds everyone that it is absolutely opposed to any war. War is not the solution to any problem. It as and remains the most frightening of human calamities. Down with war! Long live Peace!\\" A few days later France was at war. Many CGT leaders were affected by the surge of patriotism and actively supported the defense of republican liberties against German aggression. Later years During World War I Yvetot kept his title but gave up his union work and took a job as a typesetter. Soon after he accepted leadership of the National Association of War Orphans in √âtretat, and devoted himself to helping children. He went to Montenegro and Serbia in 1915 to collect Yugoslav orphans when the Central Powers occupied that country. He was dismissed from the leadership of the CGT in 1918. In the interwar period Yvetot was no longer militant, apart from pacifist campaigns with which he was associated. He helped with many anarchist periodicals in France and Belgium. These included le Combat (1926-1929), la Conqu√™te du pain (1934-1935), la Patrie humaine (1931-1939), le Raffut (1921-1922), la Revue anarchiste (1929-1936), le Semeur (1923-1936). He worked as a proofreader for Le Journal and l‚ÄôInformation. He joined the proofreaders' union on 1 May 1918 and was on the union committee between 1920 and 1932. He was general secretary of the union from 1921 to 1925. On the eve of World War II (1939‚Äì45) Yvetot signed a manifesto entitled Immediate Peace. Due to his health he avoided prosecution. He was no longer active in the CGT after the war started. In 1940 he underwent a serious operation and lost his job. He became close to destitution. He was briefly president of the Comit√© ouvrier de secours imm√©diat, created in March 1942, which helped working families affected by allied bombing. It was widely viewed as a collaborationist organization. Georges Yvetot died suddenly on 11 May 1942 in Paris. He was cremated on 15 May 1942 and his ashes were deposited in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in a ceremony attended by two hundred people.

Constructed 1924-25. Dancing Devils of Corpus Christi refers to a set of popular Venezuelan religious festivals held on Corpus Christi, celebrating the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. It generally refers to the practices of 11 brotherhoods in various regions, which that include more than 5,000 people, among which the best-known is the Dancing Devils of Yare. These manifestations were recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2012.  History  The brotherhood groups originated in the mid seventeenth century on the Aragua and Vargas state farms. As early as 1749, Corpus Christi was celebrated and men, women and children dressed as devils to fulfill promises made to the Blessed Sacrament. Different origins have been attributed to the Dancing Devils of Corpus Christi. According to a story about the San Francisco de Yare brotherhood, 400 years ago, a priest without the means to hold the procession of Corpus Christi said: \\"If there is no money nor believers to carry the Blessed Sacrament in procession, then the devils come!\\" After a storm, several devils presented themselves in front of the church. Regarding other stories about the Yare brotherhoods are, some references are in the novel Peon√≠a by the writer Manuel Vicente Romero Garcia, describing in a clear and illustrative manner how the dancers were C√∫a devils in the 1870s.  Brotherhoods  There are 11 groups recognized as guilds, societies or associations which constitute hierarchies to dance annually and make promises to worship the Blessed Sacrament. All are independent organizations established in their respective communities. In contemporary times, groups have organized non-profit associations that access public and private funding to improve their organizational strategies and reach a wider audience. * Dancing Devils of Yare * Dancing Devils of Ocumare de la Costa * Dancing Devils of Cata * Dancing Devils of Cuyagua * Dancing Devils of Turiamo * Dancing Devils of Chuao * Dancing Devils of Patanemo * Dancing Devils of San Rafael de Orituco * Dancing Devils of Tinaquillo * Dancing Devils of San Mill√°n * Dancing Devils of Naiguat√° Trying to reach a degree of organizational strength, several fraternities held a series of \\"national meetings,\\" each located in a different community. As a result, the National Association of Dancing Devils of Corpus Christi was created to bring together most of the existing fraternities. Yare The Dancing Devils of Yare (Diablos Danzantes del Yare) is the name of a religious festival celebrated in San Francisco de Yare, in the state of Miranda, Venezuela, on the day of Corpus Christi. The Sociedades del Sant√≠simo (Societies of the Holiest) are in charge of the celebration. Its origins are traced back to the 18th century, being the oldest brotherhood of the American continent. Every Corpus Christi (nine Thursdays after Holy Thursday), a ritual dance is performed by the so-called \\"Dancing Devils,\\" who wear colorful garments (commonly all red), layers of stripped fabric, masks of grotesque appearance and also accessories like crosses, scapulars, rosaries and other sorts of amulets. The fraternity of the devils is divided in hierarchical order, represented by their masks. There are other expressions in this particular festival named according to the location, such as the Devils of Naiguat√° and the Devils of Chuao. =Procession and dress code= Dancing Devils of Yare original Masks In this folkloric festival, devotion is given to the patron saint Saint Francis of Paola and to Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. The celebration starts Wednesday with a wake where ful√≠as (a native music style) are played, d√©cimas (native form of poetry) are recited and rosaries and other prayers are recited until dawn. The next day the devoted, disguised as devils, perform dances around the main town square. They also parade through the streets, dressed in their red costumes and masks, dancing to the rhythm of corr√≠os (octosyllabic musical poems). Later on, the group moves towards the front of the church and when the mass has ended, the Eucharist is placed at the church's entrance and a sort of fight representation begins between the devils and the guardians. Finally, the devils surrender and kneel in front of the Eucharist to show submission, dancing to the rhythm of the bamba, a music style that is more reverential. The entire performance represents the victory of Good over Evil. The dancing devils wear red shirts, trousers and stockings, a mask depicting a devil, and canvas sandals. They carry a cross made out of blessed palm leaves, a rosary, and a medallion with the image of Christ (that can be substituted by another Christian religious image). They also carry in one hand a devil-shaped maraca, and in the other, a whip.

VARTM is a variation of Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) with its distinguishing characteristic being the replacement of the top portion of a mold tool with a vacuum bag and the use of a vacuum to assist in resin flow.X. Song, ‚ÄúVacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM): Model Development and Verification,‚Äù Blacksburg, VA, 2003. The process involves the use of a vacuum to facilitate resin flow into a fiber layup contained within a mold tool covered by a vacuum bag. After the impregnation occurs the composite part is allowed to cure at room temperature with an optional post cure sometimes carried out.  Process  Typically, this process uses a low viscosity (100 to 1000 cP) polyester or vinyl ester resin along with fiberglass fibers to create a composite.J. S. Tate, A.T. Akinola, and D. Kabakov. Bio-based Nanocomposites: An Alternative to Traditional Composites. The Journal of Technology Studies. 35(1). 2009. DOI: http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/v35/v35n1/tate.html#tate2004. Normally the process is capable of producing composites with a fiber volume fraction between 40-50%. The resin to fiber ratio is important for determining the overall strength and performance of the final part, with mechanical strength being most influenced by the type of fiber reinforcement. The type of resin used will primarily determine the corrosion resistance, heat distortion temperature, and surface finish.Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) - What it is, What it is Not, What it Can, and What it Cannot Do [Online]. Available: https://www.rtmcomposites.com/process/vacuum-assisted-resin- transfer-molding-vartm. Resins used in this process must have low viscosities due to the limited pressure differential provided by the vacuum pump. High performance fibers, such as carbon fiber, can also be used. However, their usage is less common and is mainly for the fabrication of high end parts.  Air Leakages  For VARTM to create high quality composite parts it is crucial that air leakages are avoided. Air leakages can cause resin to improperly flow through the mold and also lead to the formation of air bubbles. Defects in the form of voids occur when the composite cures with air bubbles inside of it. Air leakage can be caused by a defect in the vacuum bag, an improper application of the sealant tape, or an improper seal at the points where the hose meets the vacuum bag. Air leakages can be detected using various methods. In some situations air bubbles, and consequentially air leakages can be detected simply through a visual inspection of the composite. The most simple ‚ÄòLeak isolation‚Äô method involves monitoring the vacuum pressure level to determine if there are air leaks. If the vacuum pressure level does not decrease after vacuuming all of the air out of the mold, then it can be determined that there is no air leakages.S.G. Advani, F.Zhou, J.B. Alms, and C.C. Corlay, ‚ÄúSystem and method of detecting air leakage in a vartm process,‚Äù U.S. Patent 11 742 243, Nov 5, 2009. However, if there was a drop in the vacuum pressure level it would be an indication that there was an air leakage. Unfortunately, this method for identifying the presence of an air leak does not determine the air leak‚Äôs location. Sound magnification is also utilized to locate leaks. Since air leaks make noise, this method utilizes a microphone to amplify sound to a set of speakers or headphones to help in the identification of leaks. This allows a user to detect an air leak and use the microphone to help them find the location of the leak. Unfortunately, this method is ineffective in noisy environments. Heated air can also be utilized to detect leaks. In this method heated air is forced through the mold prior to the use of a vacuum pump. If there are any air leaks in the process‚Äôs set up the hot air will be expelled through the leak. An infrared detector, can then be used to determine if there are any heat releases on the surface of vacuum bag, which would be an indication of the presence of an air leak.  VARTM vs RTM  Both VARTM and RTM are closed mold processes where pressure is used to inject resin into the mold. There are few differences in the materials used in VARTM vs RTM, with the resin and fiber basically being the same for both processes. Therefore if factors such as fiber to resin ratio and cross- sectional fiber distribution were held constant for each process, the molded part performances would be similar. RTM has a fiber preform placed between mold halves, while VARTM uses the bottom part of the mold tool and a vacuum bag with resin flow caused by the use of a vacuum. RTM results in small- medium-sized parts that can also be complex in shape, while VARTM can also create very large parts. VARTM also advantageously has lower equipment costs than RTM. The single sided nature of the VARTM mold has the drawback of only allowing for one side of the composite to have an A-class finish. However, parts can be manufactured with an A-class finish on both sides with RTM due it having both a top and bottom mold.  Advantages and Applications  This process offers the benefit of not requiring an expensive autoclave while also being capable of producing large, complex aerospace-grade parts. Products produced using this method vary widely in their application with parts being used in transportation, wind energy, marine, infrastructure, and aerospace applications. The process‚Äôs ability to create large and complex parts has allowed it to effectively reduce manufacturing costs when utilized to produce parts that are traditionally constructed of numerous small components. For instance, LOCKHEED Martin Space Systems (LMSS) experienced a manufacturing cost saving of up to 75% when it began to produce the quarter section of the equipment bay for the Trident II D5 missile using VARTM.T.

More than a million passengers came through the airport over the course of the year 1962. In 1963, a commission began to search for a new location for the airport. In 1969, the company renamed and became the \\"Flughafen M√ºnchen GmbH\\". The relocation of Munich Airport Riem to the new location between Erding and Freising was carried out on 17 May 1992. The expansion of the airport, Terminal 2, financed by Lufthansa (40%) and FMG (60%) together, was opened on 27 June 2003. The company contributed significantly to the development of the Munich airport in order to make it one of the most important air transport hubs in Europe, however the 2005 planned expansion for a third runway remains highly controversial with the resident population. In September 2014, the supervisory board stopped plans from directors Kerkloh and Weyer to participate in foreign airport operations.

History =1967= The base was located on Highway 1 approximately 8 km northwest of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and 8 km southeast of ƒê√¥ng H√† beside the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. Following a series of artillery and rocket attacks on ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base, the Marines' major logistics and aviation support base in northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, throughout the year, the Marines decided that ƒê√¥ng H√† was too vulnerable to PAVN artillery and rockets located north of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and decided to establish a new logistics base out of range closer to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City. In September 1967 the Seabees began construction of an airfield and new base area and the first aircraft landed at the airfield on 23 October. In October the 1st Marines was moved from Danang to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The Marines then launched Operation Osceola to provide security around the Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã base, the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines and 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines supporting by artillery from the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines conducted a pacification and anti-mining campaign around the base. In December Marine Aircraft Group 36 (MAG-36) forward was established at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, comprising: *HMM-163 *VMO-6 =1968= C-130 at Quang Tri Combat Base, 24 May 1968 Operation Osceola ended on 20 January, total casualties were 17 Marines and 76 PAVN killed. Also on 20 January the 3rd Marines replaced the 1st Marines at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Operation Osceola II commenced on 20 January with 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines responsible for protecting the base supported by artillery from 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines. On 24 and 31 January the base was hit by 122mm rockets and mortar fire causing minimal damage. On 31 January at the opening of the Tet Offensive the PAVN and Vietcong launched attacks on U.S. forces around Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City and the PAVN 812th Regiment launched an attack on the city itself. As the Marines had only 1 Battalion at the base they remained to defend the base while the recently arrived 1st Cavalry Division south of the city was sent to reinforce the ARVN 1st Regiment 1st Division defending the city. By 1 February the PAVN/Vietcong were in retreat having lost over 900 killed. On 16 February, the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division assumed responsibility for the Operation Osceola II area and operational control of 1/3 Marines, with the Marines only responsible for point defense of the base. On 18 April following the completion of Operation Pegasus the 26th Marines moved from Khe Sanh Combat Base to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. On 27 October, Marine Air Support Squadron 2 (MASS-2) established an Air Support Radar Team (ASRT) at QuangTri. This detachment utilized the AN/TPQ-10 Course Directing Radar Central to provide aerial delivered fires in all weather conditions both day and night. On 3 November responsibility for ASRT operations was transferred to Marine Air Support Squadron 3 (MASS-3) as MASS-2 prepared to leave Vietnam. In 1969 the Quang Tri ASRT was operational for 1,526 hours controlling 717 sorties of aircraft and responsible for the employment of 1,754.449 short tons of ordnance. On 1 November, the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for security in northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. MAG-36 units stationed at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã during this period included: *HMM-163 *HMM-262 *VMO-6 In April 1968 Provisional Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) was formed at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, units assigned included: *HMM-161 (from May 1968) *HMM-163 (until end of April 1968) *HMM-262 *VMO-6 *MATCU-66 (15 Apr-10 Oct 1968) MATCU-66 Det A Command Chronology for April 1968MAG-39(Prov) Command Chronology for Sep/Oct 1968 MAG-36 remained at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã until September 1969. =1969= On 23 April 1969, the base was the scene of one of the first reported Fragging incidents of the war when 1LT Robert T. Rohweller of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines was killed by a grenade thrown into his hut. The base was used as a staging area as the Marines withdrew from I Corps in June‚ÄìSeptember 1969. On 23 September MAG-39 began moving to Phu Bai Combat Base, completing the move by 15 October. On 22 October the Marines handed over control of their tactical area of operations (including the base) to the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division and the ARVN 1st Division. =1970‚Äì1= On 30 January 1971 the U.S. XXIV Corps forward headquarters was established at the base to support Operation Dewey Canyon II. 0n 8 May 1971 the MASS-3 Air Support Radar Team equipped with the AN-TPQ-10 radar system ceased operations at Quang Tri. During its approximately 20 months at Quang Tri the ASRT was operational for 12,032 hours, controlling 3,411 sorties against 2,942 targets and responsible for the employment of approximately 8,957 short tons of ordnance (17.9 million lbs of ordnance). =1972= By January 1972 the ARVN 3rd Division was responsible for the base, now called √Åi T·ª≠ Combat Base and had its headquarters there, MACV Advisory Team 155 was also based at √Åi T·ª≠. On 30 March 1972 the PAVN launched the Easter Offensive and at midday artillery fire began to hit the base. On the evening of 1 April, the 3rd Division headquarters was moved to a new position inside Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City while the remaining U.S. advisers stayed at √Åi T·ª≠ to coordinate artillery, naval and air support. On the early morning of 9 April √Åi T·ª≠ was hit by PAVN 130mm artillery fire and at dawn the PAVN launched an attack, led by tanks against Firebase Pedro on Route 557 to the west of √Åi T·ª≠ which was defended by the Vietnamese Marine Corps (VNMC) 6th Marine Battalion. The PAVN tanks had outrun their infantry support and 9 tanks were lost in a minefield around Pedro. An armored task force of 8 M48s and 12 M113s from the ARVN 20th Tank Battalion were despatched from √Åi T·ª≠ to support the Marines at Pedro. At the same time a flight of Vietnamese Air Force A-1 Skyraiders arrived overhead and destroyed 5 tanks. When the ARVN armor arrived they destroyed 5 54s for no losses and drove 1 captured T-54 back to √Åi T·ª≠. On 10 and 11 April further PAVN attacks on Pedro were repulsed at a cost of over 200 PAVN killed. By late April the direction of the PAVN assault in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province had moved from ƒê√¥ng H√† in the north to √Åi T·ª≠ and Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã city in the west. On 23 April the VNMC Brigade 147 relieved Brigade 258 at √Åi T·ª≠. At 06:30 on 27 April the PAVN 304th Division attacked √Åi T·ª≠ from the southwest, 2 attacks were repulsed but the base's ammunition dump was destroyed by artillery fire. On 28 April the ARVN 20th Tank Battalion was withdrawn from ƒê√¥ng H√† to support the base at √Åi T·ª≠, the ARVN 57th Regiment, fearing they were being abandoned, panicked and deserted their positions, leading to the collapse of the ARVN defensive line on the Cua Viet River. The VNMC 7th Battalion was sent to √Åi T·ª≠ to help defend the base. At 02:00 on 29 April the PAVN attacked the ARVN positions north and south of the base and the ARVN defenses began to crumble, by midday on 30 April, the 3rd Division commander ordered a withdrawal from √Åi T·ª≠ to a defensive line along the south of the Th·∫°ch H√£n River and the withdrawal was completed late that day. By August 1972 the area around the base was home to numerous PAVN artillery units which were used to bombard the ARVN defenders in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã city.In late October the ARVN began attacks north of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to try to regain positions along the south bank of the Cua Viet River. The attacks were met with a stiff PAVN response and were stopped at the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. On 27 January in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Peace Accords a ceasefire in place took effect across South Vietnam and the Th·∫°ch H√£n River would become part of the de facto border for the next 2 years, Current use The base has been turned over to housing and farmland, however the airfield is still clearly visible on satellite images.

It aired on November 20, 2014 in the U.S. on ABC. Plot As a result of almost capturing Rowan Pope (Joe Morton), he shuts down B613 and orders the killing of his agents. Jake (Scott Foley) is almost killed, and finds a kill-card with his face on. He warns Huck and Quinn (Katie Lowes), which leads Quinn to warn Charlie (George Newbern). However they end up sleeping together, but Quinn finds a kill-card with her face from his pocket, to which she finds out that Charlie was sent to kill her. However, after a fight, Charlie admits that he wasn't going to kill her in addition to inform her about his possession of the B613-files belonging to Jake. Jake gives Olivia (Kerry Washington) a gun for protection, and goes to a safe-house where he thinks Command might be staying. However, when Olivia comes home, Rowan is there waiting for her with a gun. Olivia tells him that she wasn't going to leave, as she doesn't want to leave her life behind. This makes Rowan furious of her lack of gratitude of the life he has given her. Olivia manages to get his gun and points to Rowan and pulls the trigger. But the gun isn't loaded, it was only a loyalty test set by Rowan, but Olivia's action makes her father furious and disappointed that his own daughter would try to shoot him. Rowan leaves her, claiming that she would miss him if he died. Olivia goes to her mother to try to get some information about Rowan, but Maya (Khandi Alexander) tells her to move on, as Olivia is too alike her father and she is too obsessed with finding him. Meanwhile, after finding out that Olivia lied to her, Elizabeth North (Portia de Rossi) leaks revealing photos of Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry) and Michael (Matthew Del Negro) in bed together, which creates a news scandal. Olivia suggests a marriage agreement between Cyrus and Michael, but Cyrus refuses as it would be a betrayal of James. Cyrus gives Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) his letter of resignation of Chief of Staff, after an emotional interaction between the two.

Miranda Wicker from TV Fanatic said that the episode felt more like a season finale, rather than a mid-season finale. Cory Baker from TV.com said that the episode was quite successful as a summation of everything that came in the previous eight episodes, in addition to commenting on how the episode dealt with its multitude of stories, which he called impressive. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club highlighted Kerry Washington's performance in the episode, as of how many different emotions Olivia goes through, all of which Washington credibly sells. He also commented on Olivia's monologues in the episode, where he highlighted the speech she gives to Cyrus to motivate him, in addition to commenting on the use of the word \\"bitch baby\\". Flavorwire writer Judy Berman also commented on the speech calling it another repetition-packed monologue, saying \\"has a man ever been called a ‚Äúbitch baby‚Äù so many times outside of a dominatrix‚Äôs dungeon?\\" R.B. Philippe from Morning After praised the confrontation between Olivia and Rowan and the actors' performance, saying \\"Washington and Morton's chemistry is one of the best things about Scandal and even with a full dance-card of presidents and war heroes, her relationship with her father has been the most interesting one this season.\\" Danielle Henderson from Vulture commented on how the confrontation managed to get Olivia to finally be able to come into her own now that she‚Äôs squared away how she really feels about her parents. The website \\"Bitch Stole My Remote\\" also commented on how Olivia got her \\"mojo\\" back after shooting blank at her father, which makes her regain control of herself, where she called the scene \\"the episode's best scene\\". Many critics were pleased with Olivia's decision choosing herself over Fitz and Jake. Danielle Henderson from Vulture said \\"This is the Olivia we‚Äôve been clamoring for all season. She‚Äôs not just happy, she‚Äôs downright giddy, and basically tells Jake to get onboard or get off the train.\\" Tanya Pai said \\"Finally, in its winter finale, Scandal gave us the thing we all (or at least I) have been waiting for: Olivia chose herself.\\" Bethonie Butler from The Washington Post said that Olivia took a \\"Kelly Taylor with choosing herself.

Sabat (born 1902, Cienfuegos-died 1986, Miami, Florida) was a musician and the Cuban founder of the pioneering record label Panart, which he established in 1944, eventually gaining international sale of its releases. He had studied music in the United States as a youth, serving in the U.S. Army in one of its bands, and completing his undergraduate degree in engineering at New York University. He returned to Cuba where he worked in recording. After the Cuban Revolution, Sabat sent his wife and children to the United States, ultimately joining them. He settled in Miami and founded another record company. Biography Ram√≥n S. Sabat was born in San Fernando de Camarones, Cienfuegos, Cuba in 1902. At an early age he started showing his musical inclinations and talent. He studied music with Jos√© Rivero Rodr√≠guez and learned to play the clarinet, the saxophone, the flute, and the piano. In 1919, Ram√≥n moved to the United States to study music. While in the United States, Ram√≥n enlisted into the U.S. Army and worked in one of the Army's bands. After Ram√≥n served the U.S. Army, he attended New York University, graduating with a degree in engineering. Sabat worked in different music labels and started various business ventures. In 1944, he opened the first record factory in Cuba, called Panart, and released its first recording, \\"Dry Leaf\\" by Carlos Alas del Casino. Panart had a tough time getting started due to RCA Victor‚Äôs dominant position in the record market and the relatively new character of the record technology at the time. Sabat‚Äôs business abilities and musical vision developed Panart as a successful label. By 1957, Ram√≥n had been able to expand his label and had sold around a million records worldwide. Panart helped spread Cuban music throughout the world. As the Cuban Revolution began, Ramon's wife Julia Sabat sent copies of master tapes to New York City. She was able to save about eighty percent of Panart‚Äôs catalogue. Sabat did not want to leave his record company, so he sent his two daughters and wife to the United States. Julia devised a scheme to get Sabat out of Cuba and into the United States before all doors closed. In 1961, Castro‚Äôs regime took over Panart and nationalized it. Julia and Sabat settled in Miami. Julia started a record factory in Hialeah with Sabat‚Äôs brother Galo. Though the record label was not as successful as Panart, the music produced was bought by Cuban refugees, who wanted to be reminded of the good times before Cuba fell into communist hands. Ram√≥n died from a heart aneurysm on March 15, 1986. He was buried in Our Lady of Mercy Cemetery in Miami, where his gravestone, adorned with a treble clef, reads \\"As√≠ cantaba Cuba / That's How Cuba Sang\\".

History  Haiku's Participation in Google Summer Of Code 2007 brought good results. One of the tasks assigned was the creation of an installer for .PKG files, which would serve Haiku as a replacement for the old SoftwareValet application.http://www.beosnews.com/2007/04/26/softwarevalet-replacement-in- progress/ This task was assigned to Lukasz Zemczak, who decided to change its functionality as well as the interface. He redesigned the user interface with usability improvements in mind. Zemczak defined the Package Installer as \\"It will be a simple .pkg package installer. It will be mostly based on the BeOS default pkg installer, offering a user friendly, lightweight interface. It will be written in C++, using the Haiku API.\\" Zemczak came up with a design which was much easier to use and much simpler. SoftwareValet was used before this package installer and Haiku's package installer was known to be a better version. More functions were added to it in order to come up with a much more efficient and effective installer.  Design  It is executed automatically when any file with .pkg extension is selected.

Beginning in Willamette National Forest on the western slopes of the Cascade Range, the creek flows generally west through Santiam State Forest and farmland to meet the South Santiam River west of Scio. Three covered bridges, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places, carry traffic over the creek. Two other covered bridges that originally crossed Thomas Creek were moved to parks in cities outside the creek's watershed. Several covered bridges that once spanned the creek were destroyed in weather-related incidents or were otherwise demolished. The creek at times has flooded Scio, particularly in 1964. The drop in elevation on its upper reaches, coupled with its flow volume, make it suitable at times for whitewater canoes and kayaks. The stream supports populations of smallmouth bass, cutthroat trout, and other fish. Course Thomas Creek is a tributary of the South Santiam River. It begins on the western slopes of the Cascade Range at an elevation of about above sea level southwest of Detroit Lake, which is on the North Santiam River. The creek flows generally west from its source, receiving Hall and other small creeks before reaching the unincorporated community of Jordan. Jordan Creek enters from the right at about river mile (RM) 19. The map includes river-mile markers as far upstream as the confluence with Hall Creek, from the mouth. Downstream of Jordan, other small tributaries enter before Thomas Creek flows by a stream gauge operated by the United States Geological Survey at RM 14.2. The creek then passes under Oregon Route 226 before reaching Scio. Below Scio, the creek receives Sucker Slough before entering the South Santiam River about above its confluence with the North Santiam River. The North and South Santiam combine to form the Santiam River, a tributary of the Willamette River. =Discharge= Based on data collected from 1962 to 1987 and from 2002 to 2013, the average discharge of Thomas Creek at the stream gauge near Scio was . During those years, the maximum discharge of occurred on December 22, 1964, and the minimum of occurred on September 6, 2003. The basin size above the gauge is about , or about 94 percent of the whole basin. Floods The entire city of Scio lies in a floodplain with a 1 percent annual chance of a flood.FEMA, p. 11 All of Scio was flooded in December 1964, when Thomas Creek and Peters Ditch overflowed their banks. The flooding was generally shallow except near the creek, where it reached in depth.FEMA, p. 14 A flood of this size along the creek is expected, on average, only once in 200 years. The inundation was part of a state-wide series of floods known as the Christmas flood of 1964, rated by the National Weather Service as one of Oregon's top 10 weather events of the 20th century. In January 1972, Scio was flooded again when the discharge at the gauge reached .FEMA, p. 17 Covered bridges Gilkey Bridge carries Goar Road over Thomas Creek downstream from Scio. Several covered bridges have spanned Thomas Creek since the late 19th century, some of them replacements for damaged or demolished bridges at the same spots. Three of these bridges‚ÄîGilkey, Shimanek, and Hannah‚Äîstill cross the creek, while two‚ÄîWeddle and Jordan‚Äîhave been moved to cities outside the Thomas Creek watershed. The three that still cross the creek are on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Weddle Bridge was listed on the NRHP in 1979 but delisted in 1991 after its move to Sweet Home. At roughly upstream of the creek mouth, Gilkey Bridge and a covered railroad bridge next to it crossed the creek at the former community of Gilkey and its Gilkey Station along the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The road bridge, a structure of the Howe truss type, was built in 1939, damaged and closed in 1997, repaired and re-opened in 1998. The companion railroad bridge, a Howe truss span, was removed in 1962. The Gilkey Covered Bridge carries Goar Road over the creek. The Weddle Bridge, which replaced an earlier covered bridge at the same site, once crossed Thomas Creek near Scio, at about RM 9. A Howe truss span of , it was built in 1937. In the late 1980s, the deteriorating structure, no longer in use, was scheduled for destruction. Efforts to save it led the Oregon Legislative Assembly to create the Oregon Covered Bridge Program, aimed at preserving the state's covered bridges. Weddle Bridge was the first bridge to win a grant from the program. In 1989, a group in Sweet Home raised additional funds to have the bridge moved and installed across Ames Creek in that city's Sankey Park. Shimanek Bridge near Scio carries Richardson Gap Road. Shimanek Bridge, upstream of Scio at about RM 12, is a Howe truss structure built in 1966. It is the newest and longest covered bridge in Linn County. At least four other covered bridges crossed Thomas Creek at this same spot, the first documented one in 1891. Storms and floods damaged the earlier bridges. The Shimanek Bridge carries Richardson Gap Road over the creek. About downstream of Jordan, near RM 17, the Hannah Bridge crosses the creek. Built in 1936, it is long and of the Howe truss type. Another covered bridge, built in 1912, is thought to have crossed the creek slightly upstream of the Hannah Bridge but was torn down and its lumber used in farm buildings. Burmester Creek Road crosses the Hannah Bridge. The Jordan Bridge, built in 1937 at about RM 19, was a Howe truss span. Dismantled in 1985, its timbers were moved to Stayton and reassembled in that city's Pioneer Park. Destroyed by fire in 1994, it was rebuilt in the park in 1998. Recreation The creek supports populations of smallmouth bass and cutthroat trout as well as small runs of Chinook salmon and steelhead. The stream is closed to fishing for salmon and steelhead, but anglers can fish for bass, and catch-and-release fishing for trout is allowed. Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run a segment of the upper creek from Hall Creek to 5-Mile Bridge. This stretch is rated 3 (intermediate) to 4 (advanced) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Hazards include fast water, rocky ledges, submerged or floating logs, a \\"nasty chute\\", and a debris dam. The next , from 5-Mile Bridge to Hannah Bridge is also run. It is rated class 2+ or class 3, depending on the flow volume, and at least one portage is required. Hazards include overhanging brush under which the current may sweep a canoe or kayak.

On 1 September 1791, he was appointed adjutant of the 3rd battalion of volunteers of the Meurthe and on 18 October 1792, he attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the battalion. On 1 May 1793, he captured two Prussian-occupied villages near Valenciennes. He was promoted to brigadier general on 1 November 1793, by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and confirmed in his rank the following 31 December. On 21 May 1794, he joined the Army of the Sambre and Meuse.Jean Baptiste Pierre Jullien de Courcelles, Anne Charles Basset de Montaigu. L'auteur, 1820 - France, pp. 366-371. At the Battle of Fleurus he was part of Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber's Army of the North (under temporary leadership of Joseph Souham). His position on the far left flank guarded the Sambre from Thuin to Maubeuge.Ramsey Weston Phipps, Armies of the First French Republic and the Rise of the Marshals of Napoleon I. vol. II. nl: Pickle Partners, 2011 [1929], pp. 151, 160-161. His division sustained a heavy initial attack by the Prince of Orange; its awkward situation, at right angles to the stream, forced him to initially withdraw toward Courcelles in disorder; a counterattack by Charles Daurier's detached brigade of 6,000 reinforced his own 8,000 men, and the French flank held through the battle, preventing the Coalition force from encircling the French.Robert Bowman Bruce, Fighting Techniques of the Napoleonic Age: Equipment, Combat Skills, and Tactics. Macmillan, 2008, pp. 137-140. On 11 July he was given military command of Brussels. Later, as commander of the 8th Division of the Sambre and Meuse army 11 October 1794, he was first dismissed and reinstated a month later under the orders of General Jean-Charles Pichegru, who gave him command of the 3rd Infantry Division on 25 December, and instructed him to cover the military line between Neuss and Nijmegen. Montaigu guarded the far left flank of the French line. Consequently, he transferred from the Sambre-et-Meuse, where he was known and respected, to the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, where he was unknown.Phipps, p. 243 There, on 24 July 1795, he assumed command of the 6th Division. On 31 October he temporarily took command during the Siege of Mannheim. He was forced to capitulate 21 November 1795, and was taken prisoner by Wurmser.Charles Th√©odore Beauvais de Pr√©au, Charles-Th√©odore Beauvais, Jacques Philippe Vo√Øart, Basset de Montaigu. nl: C.L.F. Panckoucke, 1822, p. 103. Upon exchange, he returned to France in April 1796 and learned that his conduct in the defense and surrender of Mannheim had been slandered. Montaigu sought to reestablish his reputation and requested a judgement. Gouvion Saint- Cyr defended him, and in his letters (Conjuration), Ernest Daudet also supported him: \\"he [Montaigu] might be a very good soldier without being fit for the arduous duties of commander of a besieged town.\\" He was acquitted by a courts martial on 25 October 1797. His association with Pichegru, who some suspected of treason, continued to taint his reputation. Pichegru later told William Wickham, the British envoy, that he had placed the worst possible troops and an unfit commander in Mannheim, which would surely lead to an Austrian victory. Phipps, p. 163. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honor on 29 March 1805 and retired on 20 June 1811. He died on 8 May 1821 at Luneville.Anne Charles Basset de Montaigu.

His book Key Economic Areas in Chinese History (1936) influenced the conceptualization of Chinese history in the West by emphasizing geographic and economic factors as the basis of dynastic power. Ji was educated at Tsinghua University in China, then in the United States at University of Chicago and Columbia University. He became a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and secretly joined the Communist Party of China. As an underground party member he was on the staff of the Institute of Pacific Relations in the 1930s before returning to China in 1939. He became a trusted adviser to the Ministry of Finance in the wartime Nationalist government but remained in China as a well-placed official in the new government of the People's Republic of China after 1949. Only after his death was his long-time Party membership acknowledged. Joseph Needham, author of Science and Civilisation in China, called Ji a \\"learned and brilliant writer\\" and Key Areas \\"perhaps the most outstanding book on the development of Chinese history among Western books in those days.\\"quoted, Zou Jinwen and Song Lizhi, \\"Chinese Economics Students in the USA,\\" in Ying Ma, et al. Thoughts on Economic Development in China (New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 182 Family background The Ji family was prominent in Shanxi education and politics. Chaoding's grandfather was a landlord who had a reputation for treating tenants honestly and supplying grain to the poor in times of shortage. His father, Ji Gongquan (ÂÜÄË≤¢Ê≥â; 1882‚Äì1967) studied law in Japan, but when the Republican Revolution of 1911 broke out and his government scholarship was suspended, he returned to China rather than accept Japanese government support. Chaoli (c), Chaozhu (r). He became friends with Lu Xun, with whom he shared many progressive views. Ji Gongquan told his son Ji Chaozhu that he then calculated that \\"if I were to join the 'Preserve the Empire Party' I might lose face. If I were to join the Revolutionary Party I might lose my head. I decided I was wisest to keep both.\\" He became education commissioner in the 1920s for the new Shanxi provincial government of Yan Xishan, but when he was ordered to open fire on student demonstrators, he resigned and moved his family from the capital back to Fenyang. Ji Chaoding had two younger brothers, Ji Chaoli (ÂÜÄÊúùÁêÜ, better known as Chao-Li Chi) and Ji Chaozhu (born 1929), who became a highly placed translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after 1949, and a younger sister, Ji Qing (). Education and early career In 1916 Ji Chaoding entered Tsinghua University, a school supported by funds from the Boxer Indemnity and whose classes were taught largely in English. In the aftermath of the 1919 May Fourth Movement, an awakening of patriotic spirit, Ji Chaoding led radical nationalist activities along with classmates Luo Longji and Wang Zaoshi. After graduating in 1924 he went to the United States to study on the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1926 with a bachelor's degree in history. While there he was president of the Chicago Chinese Student Association, and worked with the American Anti- Imperialist League. In 1926 Ji joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). The Party had a keen interest in global communism, and established a Chinese Bureau to supervise students from China. At that time, the newly formed Communist Party of China was in a United Front alliance with the Nationalist Party of Sun Yat-sen, who was popular among American Chinese, and Ji developed a national reputation as a public speaker able to rouse support for China with his anti-imperialist speeches to local Chinese groups in Chinese or to leftist comrades in English. In 1926, Ji and several of his Tsinghua friends denounced American supporters of the Nationalists and secretly joined the Communist Party of China. Their membership was kept secret in order to avoid surveillance or deportation, to allow them to work in American Chinese communities where the Nationalists were strong, and to keep their options open when they returned to China. In the winter of 1926, on the orders of the Chinese Bureau, Ji sailed to Europe to attend the League Against Imperialism, organized in Brussels for colonialized peoples by the Comintern agent Willi Munzenberg. In 1927, Ji married Harriet Levine in Paris, whom he had met on the boat to Europe. The Chinese Bureau of the CPUSA ordered Ji and a group of students back to China to take part in the revolution, but White Terror led by Chiang Kai-shek ended the First United Front, and the group went to Moscow instead. China TodayThere Ji studied at Sun Yat-sen University, which had been founded to train Chinese students in revolution, and acted as interpreter for the Chinese communists who had fled China. He attended the Sixth Congress of the Communist International, and was one of the secretaries to Deng Zhongxia, China's delegate. William Z. Foster, an American delegate to the Congress, suggested that Ji not return to China but rather should return to the United States to publish a newspaper, a suggestion which Ji accepted. In 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany, Ji met the economic historian Karl Wittfogel, then a member of the German Communist Party. Ji was deeply influenced by Wittfogel's Marxist analysis, which used geography and economics to analyze the development of China's political system. Wittfogel argued that imperial despotism arose from control of waterways, which gave the ruling dynasty the ability to extract grain and gather tax revenue. When Ji returned to New York for graduate study in economics at Columbia University, he joined the central committee of the CPUSA Chinese Bureau, and wrote a series of articles for the Daily Worker under the name Richard Doonping. Ji's wife, Harriet, was a cousin of Philip Jaffe, a New York communist who urged Ji to join International Labor Defense, a radical labor group. Ji and Jaffe formed the American Friends of the Chinese People. They both wrote under pseudonyms for China Today, a magazine sponsored by CPUSA. Ji also appeared on Broadway in the Soviet writer Sergei Tretyakov's play Roar China!. Wartime activities In 1937, Ji, Jaffe and their group decided that China Today lacked the academic stature to be convincing to influential Americans. Instead, Jaffe, with the financial support of Frederick Vanderbilt Field, an open member of the CPUSA and secretary of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations, founded a new journal, Amerasia. Ji served on the editorial board along with many scholars of less radical politics, as well as Chen Hansheng, another underground communist. Ji wrote a regular column, \\"Far Eastern Economic Notes,\\" which used materials supplied from Party sources in China. In 1937 the IPR appointed Ji to its research staff, and in 1938 he traveled to China financed by a $90,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to gather material for a study of China's wartime economic situation. When Japanese troops were about to take Fengyang, Ji's father, Ji Gongquan, had assumed that the occupation authorities knew of his Japanese education. To avoid being coerced into joining the government, Ji Gongquan and his family fled to Hankow, which became the temporary national capital after the fall of Nanjing. Ji Gongquan became frustrated with Chiang Kai-shek, so Chaoding, who was then in China doing research, arranged the difficult passage through South China and Hanoi as the family made their way to New York. Chaoding had planned to go to the wartime communist capital in Yan'an, but Zhou Enlai asked him to instead accompany his family to the United States, where he could present sympathetic information while not revealing his political allegiance. Ji continued his work with the IPR and the magazine Amerasia. Ji Chaoding returned to China in March 1940. He was a member of the government's financial mission to the U.S. Ji had been recruited in New York for this role in 1939 by the Shanghai banker K. P. Chen, who headed the Universal Trading Corporation (), a quasi- government mechanism for loans from the U.S. Treasury Department to the Chongqing government. Ji and Chen returned to China through Burma, and Ji returned to New York in December, 1940. He became Secretary General of the Sino-American British Currency Stabilization Board, which took over from the Universal Trading Corporation. Again his boss was K.P. Chen. The American representative on the Board was Solomon Adler, who was later accused of being a Soviet agent. Ji traveled for the Board to Shanghai and Chongqing in July 1941. Ji accepted a position in the wartime government in Chongqing, where he lived in the same rooming-house as Adler. One senior Nationalist Party official, Chen Lifu, later complained that the intelligence agencies knew of Ji's communist connections but that Finance Minister H.H. Kung trusted Ji because they were from the same province and Kung respected Ji's father. The next Finance Minister, T. V. Soong, Chen continued, was American trained and could not speak Chinese well. Soong and Ji got along because they both had a better command of English than Chinese, Chen charged, and that Ji fed damaging policies to both Kung and Soong, but Chiang Kai-shek trusted and defended them because they were married to his wife's sisters. Ji Chaozhu, Ji's brother, recalled that Kung had once demanded\\" \\"Chaoding, tell the truth. Are you a Communist?\\" Knowing that a Communist might be tortured or executed, Chaoding replied, \\"Uncle, I have followed you these many years... Do I look like a Communist to you?\\" When the war ended, Ji's wife and two children came to China for the first time. The couple divorced, however, since Ji planned to stay in China, where Harriet did not want to remain. Ji traveled to Australia in 1948 as an advisor to the Nationalist delegation at the United Nations Economic Council, and on his return to China was made economic advisor to Nationalist General Fu Zuoyi, a fellow Shanxi native. Ji and his father were among the intellectuals who persuaded Fu to peacefully surrender the city to the communist armies. Ji met with Fu at their Beijing home as part of the ultimately successful effort. After 1949, Ji Gongquan continued his national and provincial educational and legal activities under the new government. Career in the People's Republic On the eve of the communist revolution in 1949, Ji became director of the research department of the People's Bank, then went with the revolutionary armies to Shanghai, where he became assistant general manager of the Bank of China. When the new government was declared in October, although his relation with the Communist Party was not known, he was put in charge of foreign capital enterprises under the Government Administration Council. In the 1950s, he represented China on trade and commercial missions. Domestically, he was a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a body made up of third party groups. Ji favored trade with Western Europe and foreign investment, one of the first in the government to do so, because he believed that China needed Western technology in order to develop. But he also insisted that this foreign trade should be balanced, adding that Beijing would have to conduct marketing efforts to promote Chinese goods abroad. Some criticized him for this openness to the West and for his American education and contacts, saying that he \\"drank too much American water.\\" His brother, Chaoli, later commented that it was just as well that Chaoding was divorced from his wife, Harriet, for their marriage would have prevented him from playing a major role in the Party. He then married Luo Jingyi, another Chinese student activist who had joined the Communist Party in the United States in the 1920s. Ji Chaoding died suddenly in 1963 of a cerebral hemorrhage. Joseph Needham organized a memorial service in Cambridge, England, and asked Owen Lattimore and other prominent leaders to speak. Lattimore wrote that Ji was \\"humane to the marrow of his bones.\\" In Beijing, Ji was given a state service attended by Fu Zuoyi and high officials at which Zhou Enlai gave an encomium. Only after his death was Ji's long-time membership in the Chinese Communist Party officially acknowledged. Accusations Only after his death were accusations of his membership in the Chinese Communist Party confirmed, but there had long been accusations of radical activity and association with communists. Investigations by the FBI summarized Ji's above-ground activities: From his days at the University of Chicago in the 1920s Ji had worked with and supported communists, and when he returned from China in the 1930s, he was introduced to the Institute of Pacific Relations. He worked on several projects with Philip Jaffe, most prominently on the publications China Today and Amerasia, both of which presented views of China which were sympathetic to the communists. In wartime Chongqing, Ji lived in the same boarding-house as John S. Service, an American Foreign Service Officer who was to leak State Department documents to Jaffe in the Amerasia documents case, and Solomon Adler, a friend of Ji's and official of the Treasury Department who was later accused of being a Soviet spy. The historian M. Stanton Evans wrote that this \\"trio\\" worked to undermine the government of Chiang Kai-shek. Chen Lifu told historian Stephen MacKinnon in 1992 that \\"it was Chen Hansheng and Ji Chaoding who were responsible [for the loss of the mainland].\\" MacKinnon concluded on the basis of his own research that Chen's charges were \\"at least partially justified.\\" Ji worked in Washington during the war to undermine the reputation of the Nationalist government, though \\"how much Ji contributed to the failure of the Bank of China to control inflation during the civil war years is an open question.\\" Key Economic Areas in Chinese History Key Economic Areas in Chinese History, Ji Chaoding's doctoral dissertation at Columbia University, was published in London by the Institute of Pacific Relations in 1936 (it was not published in the United States until many years later). This was Ji's only book and it contained only 136 pages, but it had wide influence. A review of the 1964 reprint noted that \\"three decades after its completion and initial publication, this study still offers data and insights on the economic history of China not readily available elsewhere.\\" The book identified key areas of grain production which, when controlled by a strong political power, permitted that power to dominate the rest of the country and enforce periods of stability.Michael Dillon, Dictionary of Chinese History p. 102 Richard Louis Edmonds wrote in 2002 that Ji offered this theory as an \\"overlay\\" to the largely political, historical-oriented dynastic-cycle theory developed by traditional Chinese historians. Ji saw the lower Yellow River as the key economic area of the first period of unity and peace in the Qin and Han dynasties, but in the second such period, the Sui dynasty and the Tang dynasty, the key area shifted to the lower Yangzi basin, though linked to the Yellow River basin by the Grand Canal. During the third period, that is, the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties or roughly the 13th‚Äì19th centuries, the lower Yangzi remained the key economic area, but the governments put much effort into developing the Hai River basin as a new area southeast of modern Beijing.Richard Louis Edmonds, \\"History: Historical Perspectives on the Current Geography of China.\\" in Terry Cannon, Alan Jenkin, eds.,The Geography of Contemporary China (London: Routledge, 2002): pp. 69‚Äì70. Karl Wittfogel, who was thanked by Ji in the preface, reviewed the book in the pages of Pacific Affairs in 1936, saying it was \\"an extremely important contribution to a real understanding of China's past and present.\\" When Ji used geographical distribution of water control to explain the territorial form of China's political and economic development, Wittfogel continued, \\"the motives behind the economic political activities of China's dynasties thus appear much less humanitarian, but infinitely more realistic.\\" Wittfogel did note that Ji's term \\"semi-feudalism\\" might better be called \\"Oriental Society\\" or \\"Oriental Absolutism.\\" Yet Ji was one of the few Chinese intellectuals to be inspired by Wittfogel's reading of Marx. Most Marxist intellectuals in China were uncomfortable with Marx's concept of an Asiatic Mode of Production, viewing it as too negative because it denied China's ability to develop independently. Ji and Wittfogel differed from Stalin and the Comintern, who insisted that all human history developed in the same stages whether in Europe or Asia, and who insisted that the Asiatic mode of production did not fit into this unilinear pattern. Ji did, however, follow Stalinist orthodoxy in labeling imperial China as \\"feudal.\\"William T. Rowe, \\"Approaches to Modern Chinese Social History,\\" in p. 264 Ji's innovative analysis of early Chinese civilization as arising from the interaction of settled agriculture and Inner Asian pastoral economies work influenced Owen Lattimore. One historian commented that it was \\"an irony\\" that neither Lattimore or his critics in the 1950s knew of Chi's Comintern connections., pp. 42, 48, 83 Karl Wittfogel, however, testified that when they had been in China together he had told Lattimore that Ji was a communist. Lattimore denied any knowledge to that effect. Selected works * The major part of this pamphlet was first published in a series of eight articles in the Daily Worker (Nov. 25 to Dec. 2, 1929).
