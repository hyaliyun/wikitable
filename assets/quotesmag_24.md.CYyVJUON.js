It is currently in service on the Valour-class frigates of the South African Navy. Role Its primary role is to defend against attack by helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and missiles. It has a secondary role against surface vessels and shore targets, both in symmetrical and asymmetrical warfare and also in law enforcement where accuracy is critical because collateral damage is unacceptable. Design The system consists of two GA35 rapid-fire automatic cannons mounted side by side in an unmanned low radar observable turret. Target acquisition is by the installed search and track radar, while an optronic tracking system with infrared and visible spectrum modes provides fire-control. A control console is located in the ship's operations room, although the system operates automatically in the air-defence mode. An emergency control panel is fitted on the rear of the turret. The turret does not penetrate the deck on which it is mounted. On the Valour class frigates it is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar. The turret is fully self-contained and requires only an electrical supply and a radar data feed from the ship's combat management system and the control console. The turret is capable of unlimited full circle traverse at up to 70° per second and elevates from 10° below to 85° above horizontal at up to 40° per second. The turret's on-board computers do the ballistic calculations and fire-control. The high level of self-containment and compact size and low weight allows installation on a wide variety of ships down to as small as 200 tonnes. Ammunition The cannons fire the full range of NATO standard 35×228 mm ammunition; HEI, HEI-T, SAPHEI, APCI-T, Prac and Prac-T; all manufactured by Rheinmetall Denel Munition's PMP division. =Anti-missile= In the anti-missile role it uses Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition from RWM Schweiz AG. This round ejects 152 tungsten projectiles at a predetermined distance, between 40 and 10 m, from the target. A 25-round burst of AHEAD rounds produces 3,800 of these small projectiles to destroy the incoming missile. Cruise missiles can be destroyed at 2.5 km and high speed missiles at 1.5 km range. The system's anti-missile capability is further enhanced by adding Denel's Closed Loop Fire Correction System, which tracks projectiles all the way to the target. This allows for real-time correction of bias errors in the control system and compensation for atmospheric conditions.

The family then moved to St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada in 1971 where he remained until he finished formal studies at Lakeport Secondary School and Brock University (1987–1989). After acquiring his bachelor's in Business Economics he moved to Montreal to study with bassist Michel Donato, first within the confines of McGill University and then later privately. He then went to the Banff School of Fine Arts (1990) to study with Rufus Reid, Kenny Wheeler, Steve Coleman. This is where he first met Martin Speake who was later to become an important musician friend and peer. He returned briefly to St. Catharines in 1992 and won an Ontario Arts Council Award to live and study in New York with Dave Holland. During that year, however, his parents succumbed to cancer and he returned to Canada and moved to Toronto. Over the years Hopkins has performed with a host of musicians such as Diana Krall, Peter Appleyard, Warren Vache, Rob McConnell, Robert Farnon, John Hicks, Mark Murphy, Lester Bowie, Sam Rivers, Kenny Wheeler, Don Thompson, Moe Koffman, Norman Amadio, Scott Hamilton, Edward Simon and others. More recently he has toured Britain and continental Europe with the Bobby Watson All Stars featuring Bobby Watson on alto sax, Bruce Barth on piano, Stephen Keogh on drums and Duncan on double bass.

They were later joined by, among others, Max Werner Lenz, Elsie Attenhofer, Voli Geiler, Margrit Rainer, Ruedi Walter, Heinrich Gretler, Zarli Carigiet, Karl Meier and Alfred Rasser. The musical director was the pianist, Nico Kaufmann. From autumn 1950 to spring of 1951, Margrit Läubli appeared in the last programs of Cabaret Cornichon. The Cabaret Cornichon was essentially an entertainment cabaret but, inspired by the ideals of what later became known as 'Geistige Landesverteidigung' ('national' spiritual defence), it also opposed fascism and Nazism. The term \\"Geistige Landesverteidigung\\" refers to the strong and widespread political will of the Swiss to defend the country’s independence and democratic constitution against the Nazis. The cabaret was established in opposition to the right-wing organization known as the ‘Frontenbewegung’, whose views mirrored those of the National Socialist Party in Germany. After the Second World War, the cabaret split up amid the political tensions of the Cold War. While some of its members sided with the political left, those in opposition founded the Cabaret Fédéral in 1949. References Notes and sources * Elsie Attenhofer: Cornichon.

Then he settled in Kiel, and became an ardent advocate of the independence of the provinces. He was imprisoned in 1846 for his bold opposition, but his influence was all the stronger in the Revolution of 1848, and he became a member of the provisional Government, resigning to enter the Diet. In 1851 he was excluded from the amnesty, went to America, and lived in New York City and St. Louis. In the latter city, he was the editor-in-chief of the Westliche Post during the American Civil War. In 1865, he returned to Hamburg. He died there in 1869. Writings He wrote two popular works on America, Geographisch-statistische Beschreibung der Vereinigten Staaten (Geographical- statistical description of the United States, 1853–55, incomplete), and Geschichte der Mormonen (History of the Mormons, 1856).

The village consists of one church with an ambulatory priest, approximately 30 houses and a cafe/restaurant (Ul Ciurlin - The Little Coffee) with a small menu of typical dishes from the area. As the village is inaccessible in winter there are no permanent residents, but in summer there is a population of 80-100 people. Originally farmers took their cows higher up into the mountains to graze over the summer, using Gribbio as a 'base camp' before returning down the valley for the winter. However, in recent years the village has become more popular as a summer holiday home. Gribbio, unlike Osadigo, Cala, Doro or Olina Ces, has access to a passable road from Chironico, however the road is not cleared of snow and therefore is not accessible by car in winter except in unusually mild weather. The wildlife of the surrounding area includes chamois, red deer, alpine marmots and eagles. Hunting is forbidden in the area. One of the local features is Pizzo Forno, a mountain overlooking the village. The Gribbiasca River runs at the bottom of the village. The local Italian is known as Leventinese, a subdivision of the Swiss Italian/Ticinese dialect and is particularly difficult for speakers of standard Italian to understand.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1918 to 1929.  Early life and family  Jephcott was born in Coventry to working-class parents; his father was Thomas Jephcott. Having moved to Birmingham at an early age, he was educated at St Paul's School in Balsall Heath. In 1884 he married Lucy White, daughter of William White of Birmingham.  Career  After leaving school, Jephcott took up an apprenticeship as an engineering mechanic. He joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and was twice president of the Birmingham Trades Council. He served for a time of the school board and 1895 was elected to Birmingham City Council, of which he was the second-oldest member. He later became an alderman, and was appointed in 1904 as a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1904. = Parliament = He unsuccessfully contested Paisley at the December 1910 general election. By 1918 he was regarded as a leader of working-class conservatives in Birmingham, and was selected as the Unionist candidate for the Yardley division of Birmingham. Four candidates were expected to contest the seat, all City Council members, of whom two were aldermen, but only three candidates actually stood. At the election in December 1918 Jephcott, who stood as a coalition Unionist (i.e. a supporter of the coalition government led the Liberal David Lloyd George) won the seat with 56% of the votes, a majority of 18% over the Labour Party candidate alderman George Shann, who died only three weeks after polling day. Jephcott was returned at a further three general elections, on each occasion facing only a Labour Party opponent. Before the 1923 election, The Times newspaper reported that Jephcott \\"should have no difficulty in retaining the seat\\", but his majority was cut to 7%, down from 16% in 1922. At the 1924 election, The Times initially reported local doubts about Jephcott's ability to hold the seat, but later expressed confidence in his chances, and he held the seat with a majority only slightly reduced to 6.4%. He was not a frequent participant in debates in the Commons. In May 1927, during a debate on the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Bill, Jephcott stated that the difficulties faced by trade unions arose from the fact that they \\"gave up industrial action and took to political action\\". He said that he was ready to loyally support the Labour party in Parliament on industrial issues, but because he differed from the party on the disestablishment of the Church of England and on other matters he had not been allowed to be a Labour Party candidate. In November of the following year, Jephcott seconded the motion on the King's Speech to Parliament. He was described at the time as \\"a strong constitionalist\\" who had been a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers for over 40 years.  Retirement  In July 1927 he announced his decision to retire when Parliament was dissolved, stating that at the age of 75 he felt it was time to make way for a younger man. In November 1928 month he was knocked down by a motorcycle while crossing the High Street in Birmingham, and suffered a broken ankle. He did not contest the 1929 general election, when the seat was won by the Labour candidate Archibald Gossling. Jephcott died in Birmingham on 14 March 1932, aged 79.

The project seems to have closed near the end of 2012. History Founded by Gregor Gimmy, Sclipo was launched on October 20, 2006 (then called Visuarios), as a website to share user-generated educational videos. The initial product allowed professional and amateur teachers to share knowledge online through video, making Sclipo one of the first websites of user- generated educational videos. Sclipo then recognized that independent teachers, small schools and companies in continuous education growingly used generic web applications for teaching such as Skype for live web classes and Slideshare to share documents. In addition, Sclipo saw that current learning management systems, such as Moodle or Blackboard, were too complex and expensive for a small, 1-15 teacher-sized, educational entity. Sclipo then decided to expand its offering and create a suite of web applications specifically for learning purposes and adapted to the needs of small educational entities in continuous education. These were launched continuously, the first one being the Virtual Classroom (live teaching) application in September 2007. Sclipo website went down about November 2012, and since then redirects to a Spanish informational web catalog. Features A Sclipo Online Campus provides synchronous and asynchronous web applications to learn, teach, socialize, administer, promote and sell face-to-face as well as online education services and content. * Learning & Teaching applications are Course Manager, Library and a Virtual Classroom for live teaching. Features of the Course Manager include a learning path, tests, discussion forum, content sharing, progress control and live web classes. The Library allows teachers to store and share content in multiple formats: documents, videos, audio and images. Teachers can upload own content to their Library and add that from popular generic content-sharing websites such as Slideshare, Scribd, Vimeo and YouTube. The Virtual Classroom application allows to hold live classes, webinars and meetings via a web conferencing system over the Internet. Features include multiple video and audio sharing, desktop sharing, presentations with integrated whiteboard, and public and private chat. * Social applications include a private personal profile, a contact network, online groups, an event organizer, discussion forums, walls, feeds, the ability to follow Online Campuses, a messaging system and Facebook Connect.

A forced marriage is different from an arranged marriage. In many cultures, it is customary for families to arrange meetings between their children in the hopes of fostering a voluntary relationship that will lead to a marriage. In such situations, while the initial meetings are arranged by the families and a marriage is encouraged, the ultimate decision regarding whether to marry remains with the couple and the choice to marry is strictly voluntary. In contrast, in a forced marriage, an individual is threatened and/or coerced by her family to enter into the marriage against her will and may suffer honor violence or if she resists or refuses the marriage.\\" United States \\"Estimates are that hundreds of Pakistani girls in New York have been flown out of the New York City area to Pakistan to undergo forced marriages; those who resist are threatened and coerced.Katz, Nancie.

Many more existing cases are likely hidden from the view of officials \\"The U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual provides recommendations on what consular personnel can do when faced with a minor who contacts them, to prevent a forced marriage from taking place.7 FAM 1740: Forced marriage of minors. U.S. Department of State. 2005. It is not known how often consular officials are faced with this issue, and it is not known what advice consular personnel provides U.S. citizens abroad who are faced with this issue. It is worth researching and publicly releasing information on how often U.S. consular personnel are approached with regard to this topic and what their course of action is, and how such cases are eventually resolved (or are not). The “best practices” of the British Foreign Office may be worth replicating to ensure that vulnerable girls can sound the alarm if need be, so authorities can intervene where necessary to help protect women from being flown out of the country to face forced marriages, and assist them abroad to return to the U.S. unharmed. From the information that is publicly available, British practices in this area seem more stringent and proactive than U.S. practices. American courts (like British courts) should be able to offer “forced marriage protection orders” to protect girls and women who face a looming forced marriage. U.S. law enforcement officials, civil servants dealing with issues of women’s rights and education, and Congressional constituent offices should receive statutory guidelines (as in the U.K.) on what to do when a person contacts them who is facing a forced marriage. At the institutional level, existing U.S. child welfare, domestic violence and human trafficking institutions are currently not equipped to protect forced marriage victims or to address their unique needs. Most domestic violence shelters will not accommodate minors, and few service providers are trained or funded to address the issue of forced marriage. In several states, child welfare officials declared that the intended child-brides were not at risk of imminent harm and sent them home, where the girls’ parents promptly severed all contact with advocates and sent the girls to the altar.Alanen, Julia. (2010). Forced marriage of minor girls in the U.S. Catholic Legal Immigration Network. These resources should be strengthened at the local level, and in dialogue with agencies at the State and Federal level dealing with domestic violence issues.\\" United Kingdom The British government has set up a Forced Marriage Unit, and increased police awareness of forced marriages and honor-related violence. The FMU has a confidential helpline and is the UK’s \\"one-stop shop\\" for government policy on forced marriage, coordinating outreach projects and providing support and information to those at risk.Forced marriage case handling guide for MPs and Constituency Offices. Forced Marriage Unit, 2009. p. 4. Forced- marriage protection orders (possible under British law) offer help to people who face the prospect of being forced into marriage, either inside or outside the UK; an order can be drawn up immediately in an emergency to protect and prevent a forced marriage. Violators can be punished with up to two years in prison.Forced marriage protection orders—how can they protect me? Her Majesty’s Courts Service, 2008. The British government has worked through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (the equivalent of the U.S. State Department) and the British police (backed by legislation, where appropriate) to deter and punish perpetrators and open avenues of escape for victims (and potential victims) of violence.Murray, Douglas. (2010). Crimes of the Community: Honour- based violence in the UK. London: Centre for Social Cohesion. The British government has provided detailed guidelines to members of Parliament and constituent offices, civil servants, health professionals and others on how to deal with forced marriages in an effort to raise awareness and efficiently disseminate best practices.Multi-Agency practice guidelines: Handling cases of Forced Marriage.

Netherlands A study in prevention is the city of Rotterdam’s school-attendance monitoring system to ensure that Muslim girls are not withdrawn from school and forced into an arranged marriage during summer break.NRC Handelsblad. (September 21, 2009). Possibly 15 girls in Rotterdam faced forced marriage. NRC. If a girl faces a looming forced marriage she can (if she wishes) file a declaration with her school, and the school must notify police if she does not return after summer break; a forced stay abroad can be fought legally with such a declaration. Teachers are also being trained to recognize signs of possible forced marriage. As of September 2009, in Rotterdam three young women signed such a contract. The municipality of Rotterdam and the GGD maintain regular contact with these girls. As a result, the girls were not forced to marry in the summer of 2009. Germany German teachers will receive guidelines on handling the issue of forced marriages with their pupils, the German government announced in June 2010 (following a number of cases).Teachers to get training in forced marriage prevention. The Local, June 11, 2010. The guidelines aim to give schools and teachers concrete tips for detecting warning signs if a student is being pushed into a forced marriage, and on talking to parents and alerting child- protection services. Sweden The Swedish government announced in May 2010 the launch of an inquiry aimed at tightening legislation banning forced and child marriages, which it identified as a continuing problem.Sweden launches inquiry into forced marriage. The Local, May 21, 2010. =Honor violence and killings= \\"Honor violence is a form of violence against women committed with the motive of protecting or regaining the honor of the perpetrator, family, or community. Victims of honor violence are targeted because their actual or perceived behavior is deemed to be shameful or to violate cultural or religious norms. Conduct such as resisting an arranged marriage, seeking a divorce, adopting a Western lifestyle and wearing Western clothing, and having friends of the opposite sex have resulted in honor violence. Honor violence involves systematic control of the victim that escalates over a period of time and may begin at a young age. Honor violence can be perpetrated by one individual or can be a group campaign of harassment and violence committed by an entire family or community. It can take many forms, including verbal/emotional abuse, threats, stalking, harassment, false imprisonment, physical violence, sexual abuse, and homicide.\\" Honor violence is intended to be corrective. If the girl complies, normally punishment ceases. If not, honor violence sometimes ends in murder—such as the 2009 murder of 20-year-old Iraqi-American Noor Almaleki in ArizonaRubin, Paul. (March 31, 2010). \\"Honor Thy Father: A Muslim man in Phoenix ‘honor killed’ his Americanized daughter.\\" Riverfront Times. and the 2008 honor killings of Sarah and Aminah Said in Lewisville, TexasEiserer, Tanya. January 6, 2008. \\"Slain Lewisville sisters mourned at Christian, Muslim services.\\" Dallas News.—carried out with the knowledge (and help) of family members and other relatives. When the corrective beatings fail to dissuade a girl or woman from complying with the wishes of her family (or giving up behavior they consider shameful), the family may conclude that the only way they can regain \\"honor\\" lost through the girl's \\"shameful\\" behavior is to kill her. United States American authorities currently do not track cases of honor violence. Most law-enforcement officials, educators, guidance counselors and social workers are not familiar with honor violence and on the circumstances that make honor-related crimes different from other types of domestic violence.Chesler, Phyllis. (Spring 2009). \\"Are honor killings simply domestic violence?\\" Middle East Quarterly. As federal officials track the incidence of domestic violence, they should track incidents of honor-related violence. Pilot projects could be established in large metropolitan areas (such as New York) to screen criminal cases (including murder cases of girls and women from honor-related cultures, such as Pakistani, Afghan, Kurdish women) for honor- related motives. Federal offices dealing with domestic violence can become aware through researching specific challenges facing women from Islamic and honor-based cultures, and convey this information to cities and areas where larger populations from honor-based cultures live. According to the Foundation, U.S. government officials should do a better job of selecting outreach partners and liaisons to the American Muslim community. Many Muslim outreach partners whom U.S. government officials select for dialogue and liaison are religiously orthodox; these orthodox Muslims tell U.S. government officials that secular (and feminist) American Muslims are not representative of the American Muslim community, leading U.S. government officials not to include them in dialogue.Mirahmadi, Hedieh. 2010. Navigating Islam in America. In The Other Muslims: Moderate and Secular, ed. Zeyno Baran. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 17-32. Moderate, secular and feminist Muslims have been disempowered in the United States; the British government has made a similar error in its choice of “representative Muslims”. Unwise choices of dialogue partners ensure that issues such as honor killings, domestic violence, forced marriages and FGM are not prominent on the agenda. By selecting better dialogue partners (and then seeking their advice and input) U.S. government officials can empower moderate, secular and feminist Muslims, giving them the voice they need to raise these issues in a constructive manner. The Netherlands In a pilot project carried out by Dutch police between October 2004 and March 2006, many more incidents of honor-related crimes (79) were uncovered than had been expected when police screened cases specifically for the presence of “honor” motives and flagged them as such.Elseiver. (June 6, 2005). Verdonk: Gevallen Eerwraak ‘zorgwekkend’. The figures (deemed “shocking” by government officials) led to more training of police officers, social workers and other officials to be alert for such crimes and act appropriately. In addition, the Dutch established the inter- agency Honor-Related Violence Task Force in 2006 to raise awareness and develop inter-agency intervention approaches.Honour-related violence. Dutch Justice Ministry. July 2006. The task force focuses on issues of social prevention, protection and criminal prosecution. The Dutch government has set aside funds to help women who are (potential) victims of honor-related violence. At the local level, Dutch cities such as Amsterdam are pressing ahead with initiatives to curb honor-related violence. Amsterdam has made cooperation agreements with non-governmental partners regarding a speedy and adequate approach in cases of imminent honor-related violence. Authorities work actively with NGOs with the goals of protecting (potential) victims and using the law to prevent escalation of honor violence to the death of innocent victims. =Female genital mutilation= Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the mutilation of a girl's clitoris (and often the labia)—usually from 3 to 13 years of age but sometimes earlier, or as late as before marriage or pregnancy. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 100 to 140 million female genital mutilation victims (most from Africa) worldwide. The procedure can result in urinary problems, severe bleeding and complications during childbirth; it has no health benefits. FGM is usually performed for religious or cultural purposes.Stevens, Alexis. (March 11, 2010). \\"Mom accused of circumcising female infant.\\" AJC.\\"Female circumcision act in force\\". BBC News Online. March 3, 2004.Lakhani, Nina (20 December 2009). \\"UK fails to halt female genital mutilation\\". The Independent. Retrieved November 26, 2011. United States As of 2012 Federal law makes FGM illegal, but does not punish parents or relatives who take young girls out of the country to undergo it. A 2010 case in Georgia involved the removal of a nine-month-old girl's clitoris by her mother, who faces female- genital-mutilation and child cruelty charges and has lost custody to the baby girl's father. A bipartisan bill introduced in 2010, the “Girls Protection Act” (H.R. 5137) sponsored by Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) and Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), would make it a federal crime to transport a minor outside the United States for the purpose of female genital mutilation. The Girls Protection Act would extend current federal law to ensure that the same penalties that exist for domestic FGM apply to those involved in the transport of a minor abroad for the purpose of FGM. United Kingdom Building upon (and replacing) the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, the British Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2003 makes it illegal to perform FGM, take girls out of the country for the procedure, and increases the penalty of imprisonment to 14 years. As of 2009 there had been no cases of FGM prosecuted, and girls are subject to the procedure when they return with their families to their country of origin for the Christmas holidays. Netherlands The Netherlands has received a large influx of immigrants from countries practicing female genital mutilation—particularly from Somalia, which is known for its severe FGM practices. As a Member of Parliament in the Netherlands, Ayaan Hirsi Ali unsuccessfully campaigned to create a control system for girls from at-risk communities by requiring pediatricians and other pediatric medical professionals to screen them for FGM.Bouscher, Jacqueline; Rosof, Ali. \\"Culture Clash: Designing Vaginas, FGM, and Dutch Policy.\\" Humanity in Action. Retrieved November 26, 2011. Norway The Norwegian Action Plan to combat FGM for residents and immigrants was initiated in 2000. The present plan focuses on prevention, public awareness and required reporting of likely (or completed) FGM by public employees to the Municipal Child Welfare Service (MCWS). The plan has assigned metrics to measure success, including targeted prevention activities for the holiday season and prosecution of offenders.Kafo, Musu Kangbeng. (September 22, 2009).

The 2010 United Kingdom student protests were a series of demonstrations in November and December 2010 that took place in several areas of the country, with the focal point of protests being in central London. Largely student-led, the protests were held in opposition to planned spending cuts to further education and an increase of the cap on tuition fees by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government following their review into higher education funding in England. Student groups said that the intended cuts to education were excessive, would damage higher education, give students higher debts, and broke campaign promises made by politicians. The first major demonstration occurred on 10 November, jointly organised by the National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU). It involved between 30,000 and 50,000 demonstrators marching through central London, with several hundred branching off to attack and occupy the Conservative Party headquarters. This measure brought condemnation from the establishment and a divide within the student movement over the appropriateness of such tactics. The National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) called for a mass walk-out and demonstration on 24 November, with occupations taking place at campuses throughout the UK. A march in central London was kettled in Whitehall, resulting in violent confrontation with protesters. Further demonstrations were held in central London on 30 November, when police clashed with protesters and kettled them in Trafalgar Square, while other protests took place throughout the country. Another central London protest took place on 9 December, the day that the proposed reforms were passed into law, with protesters clashing with police and being kettled in Parliament Square. The student protests were unsuccessful in their aim of preventing the government's reforms. The demonstrations had been highly controversial in the UK, being condemned for instances of violence and vandalism by both the establishment and by protestors. The behaviour of the Metropolitan Police in dealing with the protests was also widely criticised for alleged instances of untruthfulness and excessive use of force.  Background  =The Browne Report and proposed reforms= Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) were at the heart of much student anger In November 2009, the Labour Party government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown commissioned a study into higher education funding in England. Chaired by Lord Browne of Madingley, the former chief executive of BP, the report was to be titled the Browne Review. In the build up to the United Kingdom General Election in May 2010, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, pledged that he would vote against any proposed increase in tuition fees if elected to Parliament. Following the election and resulting hung parliament, Clegg made an agreement with the Conservative Party to form a coalition government in which Conservative leader David Cameron became Prime Minister and Clegg became Deputy Prime Minister. The Browne Review was subsequently published in October 2010, and contained the suggestion that the government should remove outright the existing cap of £3,290 on tuition fees. The government rejected this proposal, instead choosing to keep a cap but increasing it to £9,000. David Willetts, the Minister of State for Universities and Science, stated that the measures were \\"a very progressive package\\" and \\"at the end of this we will have a better university system than we have at the moment.\\" Contravening his pre-election pledge, Clegg expressed support for the rise in the cap on tuition fees, which would result in future students paying higher fees for their university education. =Student opposition= Student union leaders were critical of the cuts. The National Union of Students (NUS) feared that the increased cap on tuition fees would prevent potential students from poorer backgrounds from attending university. Many protesters focused in particular on Clegg's campaign promise that he would oppose any rise in tuition fees. David Barclay, the president of the University of Oxford's student union, said: \\"This is the day a generation of politicians learn that though they might forget their promises, students won't.\\" Rahul Mansigani, the students' union president for the University of Cambridge, said: \\"Large numbers of students voted for the Liberal Democrats, and there is no question that the pledge is a binding commitment.\\" Two weeks before, on 28 October, a protest was held in the University of Oxford to coincide with a visit from the Liberal Democrat minister and Business Secretary Vince Cable. Cable cancelled his visit after taking advice from the police about the protest. Several days later, on 3 November, there was a student protest in Dublin. The subsequent London protest was described by one Irish reporter as \\"scenes bizarrely similar\\" to those in the Irish capital. The initial event was the largest student protest in Britain since the Labour government first proposed the Teaching and Higher Education Act in 1998.  10 November  = London march = Demonstration at the Palace of Westminster right The first major demonstration in protest at the government's proposed reforms was held on 10 November 2010 in central London, jointly organised by the National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU). This demonstration was officially known as \\"Fund Our Future: Stop Education Cuts\\", although also termed \\"Demo 2010\\" or \\"Demo-lition 10.11.10\\". Arriving from all regions of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, approximately 30,000 to 52,000 protesters attended the demonstration. The demonstration's route was pre-approved with the Metropolitan Police Service, with marchers moving from Whitehall past Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister, and then past the Houses of Parliament, chanting such slogans as \\"no ifs, no buts – no education cuts\\", \\"they say cut back – we say fight back\\", \\"I say Tories – you say scum\\". Journalist Harry Mount of The Daily Telegraph, said: \\"Perhaps because their cause was justified, the students I saw had none of the swaggering, self- righteous manner of the student protester of legend.\\" Political groups that sent contingents to take part included the Labour Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, Socialist Workers Party, Socialist Party, Revolution, Young Communist League, Revolutionary Communist Group, and Communist Students. A few members of parliament (MPs) joined the demonstration, among them Labour MP John McDonnell, who told reporters: \\"This is the biggest workers' and students' demonstration in decades. It just shows what can be done when people get angry. We must build on this\\". Representatives of the National Pensioners Convention also took part, with the group's banner carrier, Janet Shapiro, stating that: \\"We're here because we believe education should be free, funded by the taxpayer. It is something that benefits the community, the country.\\" At the end of the march, a rally took place outside Tate Britain where demonstrators were addressed by the UCU general secretary Sally Hunt, who introduced a series of clips displayed on a giant plasma screen featuring Clegg giving a series of promises to the electorate on tuition fees, all of which he had subsequently broken. Hunt stated that making the public university system in Britain \\"the most expensive in the world\\" was unfair, that discouraging young people from going to college was not progressive, and that the increase in tuition fees represented further debts for students. The rally was also addressed by NUS President Aaron Porter and the Trades Union Congress Deputy general secretary Frances O'Grady. O'Grady offered the message to the government that: \\"Don't you dare tell us we're all in this together. The deficit certainly wasn't caused by the students.\\" The protest was scheduled to end at 2 pm, but slightly overran. The Metropolitan Police were expecting 20,000 demonstrators to turn out, well below the 50,000 figure most widely quoted in the press after the event, and did not expect any violence, so deployed only 225 officers to police the event. = Millbank occupation = In the afternoon, as protesters passed the Houses of Parliament and moved towards Tate Britain for the rally, several thousand surrounded 30 Millbank in Westminster, campaign headquarters of the Conservative Party, despite attempts by NUS organisers to stop them. Forcing their way past the limited police presence, approximately 200 people broke in and occupied the building, whilst a thousand more cheered and supported them from outside. These protesters lit placards on fire, and smashed windows before occupying and vandalising the reception area. Staff working in the building were evacuated by police around 1 pm. Around 100 protesters proceeded to the roof of the building, chanting slogans including \\"Greece! France! Now here too\\". Initial press sources blamed this action on a group of anarchists. This was later disputed, with a reporter from The Guardian noting that most of the protesters occupying the building were students who had been radicalised in opposition to the cuts, and were not all political anarchists. Protesters on the roof of 30 Millbank Riot police from the Territorial Support Group arrived an hour after the building was occupied to remove the protesters. In retaliation, the police were pelted with eggs, rotten fruit, banners, and shards of glass. One of the protesters on the building's roof, Edward Woolard, threw a fire extinguisher onto the police below. He received instant criticism from some of the protesting crowds, who called on those on the roof to \\"stop throwing shit\\". To control the situation, police used the controversial technique of kettling to trap the protesters within Millbank Square, the forecourt to 30 Millbank, whilst protesters on the outside of the building were pushed back. The police began letting demonstrators out of the building from 6:30 pm, arresting those whom they believed were responsible for vandalism. The demonstration led to a disruption in London's transport, with journalist Harry Mount stating: \\"I have never seen London traffic so jammed in 39 years living in the city.\\" Alongside the occupation of Millbank, a smaller number of protesters had travelled to the headquarters of the Liberal Democrats in Cowley Street, where a car window was smashed. In all, 14 people were injured and required hospitalisation, at least three of whom were police officers, whilst police arrested 35 of the demonstrators, sending them off to various police stations around the city. Later accounts that the numbers arrested had risen to 54, (33 men and 21 women), ten of whom were aged under 18 and the majority of whom were students. = Response to the Millbank occupation = Students and unions NUS President Aaron Porter condemned the occupation of 30 Millbank, claiming that it was caused by \\"those who are here to cause trouble\\" and that he was \\"disgusted that the actions of a minority of idiots are trying to undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest.\\" General Secretary of UCU Sally Hunt also condemned the occupation, declaring that \\"the overwhelming majority of staff and students on the march came here to send a clear and peaceful message to the politicians.... The actions of a minority, out of 50,000 people, is regrettable.\\" Oxford University's Student Union (OUSU) President David Barclay issued a statement declaring that \\"OUSU supports the rights of students to protest non-violently. It is hugely unfortunate that some people yesterday were injured and that arrests were made.\\" Contrastingly, other student leaders, trade unionists, and academics expressed support for elements of the occupation of 30 Millbank. Amongst others, the president of University of London Union Clare Solomon, the Education Officer of the London School of Economics, Ashok Kumar, the Education and Campaigns Officer at University College London, Michael Chessum, the National Union of Students' black students' officer Kanjay Sesay, the NUS' LGBT students' officers Vicki Baars and Alan Bailey, the President of the RMT trade union Alex Gordon and the playwright Lee Hall all signed a statement declaring that: > We reject any attempt to characterise the Millbank protest as small, > \\"extremist\\" or unrepresentative of our movement. We celebrate the fact that > thousands of students were willing to send a message to the Tories that we > will fight to win. Occupations are a long established tradition in the > student movement that should be defended. It is this kind of action in > France and Greece that has been an inspiration to many workers and students > in Britain faced with such a huge assault on jobs, benefits, housing and the > public sector. We stand with the protesters, and anyone who is victimised as > a result of the protest. Solomon informed the BBC that she had \\"no problem with direct actions or occupation\\", and when questioned regarding the damage done to Millbank, responded that \\"these were a few windows of the Tory Party headquarters – what they're doing to our education is absolutely millions... and they want to complain about a few windows.\\" Some socialist and student commentators criticised Porter and the NUS for their response to the situation, accusing them of careerism. Meanwhile, various university Conservative societies around London condemned the protests, and criticised students' unions for providing the \\"false impression that the majority of students are left-wing\\" and opposed to the governments' proposed reforms. Government and press Anti- Conservative graffiti scrawled during the protest. The Metropolitan Police Service admitted that they were unprepared to deal with the occupation of 30 Millbank, something which they had not been expecting. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police's Commissioner, told the press that he was \\"embarrassed\\" by how police had lost control of the situation, and condemned what he saw as \\"thuggish, loutish behaviour by criminals.\\" Stephenson remarked that \\"the one thing I would say is that it must have been an awful time for the people trying to go about their daily business in those buildings. I feel terribly sorry that they have had to go through what must have been quite a traumatic experience… We are determined to make sure that sort of thing does not happen again on our streets. I'm clear on that, the Met is clear on that.\\" His views were echoed by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who stated: \\"This is intolerable and all those involved will be pursued and they will face the full force of the law… The Metropolitan Police commissioner has assured me that there will be a vigorous post-incident investigation. He will also be reviewing police planning and response.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the occupation of Millbank, stating that he would not abandon his position on the issue of education cuts. Speaking from the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit in South Korea, Cameron said the occasion had been \\"extremely serious\\" and praised the \\"bravery\\" of the police officers. He also stated that the actions of the protesters were \\"unacceptable\\" and that \\"I was worried for the safety of the people in the building because I know people who work there\\". The following morning, Clegg went on ITV's Daybreak to state: \\"I should have been more careful perhaps in signing that pledge [to not increase tuition fees]... At the time [prior to his election] I really thought we could do it. I just didn't know, of course, before we came into government, quite what the state of the finances were.\\" A reporter from The Daily Telegraph commented that the \\"anarchic behaviour\\" of those occupying Millbank was \\"counter- productive\\" to the students' cause, and that it was the photographs of \\"a few hundred vicious hotheads\\" that would \\"linger\\" in the public imagination rather than that of the main march. The Financial Times reported that an anonymous vice-chancellor from a London university had told them that the violence would undermine the campaign, and that it \\"could not have gone better for the government. George Osborne will be delighted.\\" =Related protests= In the following days, smaller protests were held in Manchester and Cambridge, with no violent confrontations. On 11 November, student protesters occupied a building at the University of Manchester for three hours, demanding to see the accounts that discussed how government funding cuts would affect students. Between 60 and 100 students held a peaceful sit-in at Manchester's John Owens Building on Oxford Road after an NUS meeting earlier that day. Representing this group, protester Jeremy Buck said: \\"This is just what a few students who had the energy left after the London demo managed to achieve… Imagine what will happen when they have enough time to organise properly for the 24th. It is a matter of watch this space.\\" That same day, protesters at the University of Cambridge held a demonstration against the cuts at the university's annual science, engineering and technology careers fair. On 23 November, anti- education cuts protesters had assembled outside of the offices of The Guardian newspaper, where Clegg was giving his Hugo Young lecture. They brought out an effigy of Clegg, sentencing it to death and executing it by hanging, shouting the slogan \\"Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning blue\\".  24 November  A second significant demonstration took place in London on 24 November, which again led to clashes with police, this time outside Whitehall, after police kettled a large crowd. An organisation known as the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) organised a mass national walk-out of education and protest for 24 November. As a part of this, demonstrations were held in London and other locations across the United Kingdom. According to a group on the social networking website Facebook, 25,000 people had signed up to take the day off from studies and protest prior to the actual event, and these protesters included not only university students, but also school children who had walked out of lessons to join the demonstration. The NCAFC encouraged protesters to use social media to invite others to join them. One of those protesting was Jessica Linley, a law student at the University of Nottingham who had been crowned Miss England in September 2010 and who used her status to gain media coverage for the cause, telling press that she would not be able to afford to go to university if the tuition fees were increased, and that \\"these sweeping austerity measures are unacceptable.\\" =Whitehall march= Several thousand protesters, most of whom were students or school children, gathered in Trafalgar Square, central London, late in the morning. They proceeded toward Whitehall shouting the slogan, \\"fuck David Cameron\\". Believing that there had been a lack of officers at 10 November demonstration, the Metropolitan Police drafted in 1000 police officers from across Greater London to oversee the event, almost five times the number at 10 November. Police informed press that they planned to monitor fringe elements within the demonstration whom they believed planned to encourage \\"vandalism and violence\\". A vandalised police vehicle on Whitehall At Whitehall, just before 1 pm, police prevented the protesters from reaching Parliament Square and the Houses of Parliament, setting up a line of riot police to kettle the protesters. A reporter The Guardian described the crowd at this point as being \\"predominantly good natured, although very noisy\\". Nonetheless, the demonstrators tried to push through the police line, leading to clashes. An unoccupied police van which had been left in the midst of the crowd was vandalised; protesters rocked it back and forth, climbed on its roof, smashed its windows, wrote graffiti on it and threw a smoke bomb inside. A group of school girls encircled the van, urging people not to vandalise it. One of them later told reporters that \\"the cause that we're here for today isn't about 'I hate the police, I want to burn the police and I want to destroy everything they represent.'\\" At around 6 pm, mounted police charged at the north end of the crowd to push them back; despite video evidence police denied that this was an actual charge, describing it as crowd control using horses. Roughly 1000 protesters broke free of the police kettle, running throughout central London while pursued by police; The Guardian's Paul Lewis stated that \\"police were caught in a game of cat and mouse, along Charing Cross, Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus.\\" Some of these protesters committed acts of vandalism along the side streets, including knocking over rubbish bins and throwing traffic cones into the road. Various bus shelters and ticket machines in the area were vandalised, with Transport for London diverting buses away from the unrest. Approximately 200 protesters were unable to escape and remained kettled in Whitehall. Police falsely informed press that the crowd were provided with toilet facilities and water; protesters disputed these claims on social media, with ULU President Clare Solomon commenting on Facebook: \\"we're still illegally kettled in the freezing cold on Whitehall. No food, water or toilets despite what the police are telling the media. Thousands of young people needing to go home.\\" To keep warm, protesters set fire to a ticket machine within the Square, prompting riot police to secure the machine and put out the flames. From 9 to 10 pm, police permitted the rest of the Whitehall protesters to leave, approximately nine to ten hours after they had first been contained, some being searched as they left. During the clashes, police arrested 41 protesters. = Occupations and local protests = Across the UK, protesters occupied university buildings in at least 12 universities. On 23 November, protesters occupied the picture gallery corridor of Royal Holloway, University of London. They were later joined by supportive members of university staff who took part in what was labelled a \\"teach-in\\". On 24 November, the Language Centre at London South Bank University was occupied for 51 hours by over 100 students as part of the \\"Defend LSBU! Defend Our Education!\\" campaign. Defend LSBU! Defend Our Education That same day, students occupied the Jeremy Bentham Room in University College London, stating that they were protesting against \\"savage cuts to higher education and government attempts to force society to pay for a crisis it didn't cause.\\" A BBC reporter visited the occupation, remarking that the protesters \\"seem as distant from the old left as they do from the new right\\" and that \\"you get a reminder that these are students born in the 1990s. They're quoting Harry Potter rather than Che Guevara.\\" Protesters also occupied the University of East London, demanding that university managers \\"put pressure on the government on the issue of H[higher] E[ducation] cuts and tuition fee rises\\". On 24 November, students and supporters went into occupation of Appleton Tower at the University of Edinburgh, stating \\"We stand firm alongside all other students, university staff and others nationwide affected by education cuts and the risk this poses to the future of higher education.\\" At Manchester's University Place, 3000 students assembled to demonstrate, but several hundred broke away to march towards the town hall. A group of about 100 occupied a lecture theatre in the Roscoe Building. At the University of Oxford, students initially occupied the Radcliffe Camera. At the University of Cambridge, 200 students scaled the fence of Senate House and marched onto the grounds of King's College, then on 26 November students started an 11-day occupation of part of Old Schools, the main administrative block of the University. At the University of Bristol, 2000 protesters clashed with police when they tried to move into the city centre. Four were arrested. In Brighton, 3000 demonstrators marched through the city, with nearly 50 occupying a university building. Hundreds of students from Kingston University and various local schools staged an impromptu march through the town and a sit down protest at College Roundabout, leading to one arrest. In the morning of 24 November, demonstrators at the University of Birmingham occupied the Aston Webb building, the site of the Prime Ministerial debates earlier in the year; they issued a statement in which they declared that \\"we believe the government's cuts to be economically unnecessary, unfair and ideologically motivated\\" and that \\"if [the government] continue to destroy the livelihoods of the majority to benefit the rich and powerful minority, they will face increasingly widespread and radical action.\\" In Leeds, protesters amassed at the University of Leeds. Hundreds of them had walked out of the local Allerton Grange High School to join the demonstration, and later occupied the Michael Sadler lecture theatre and a room at Leeds Metropolitan University. A room at the University of Plymouth was also occupied.Staff writer (9 December 2010). \\"Plymouth, Totnes and Exeter students in fees protests\\". BBC News (via BBC News). Retrieved 28 February 2011. At Cardiff University, around 200 protesters occupied a lecture theatre after failing to gain entry to the vice-chancellor's building. =Response= During the Whitehall incident, the Metropolitan Police publicly defended their use of kettling, with Chief Inspector Jane Connors claiming that they had only used it as \\"a last resort\\". She stated: \\"it's a valid tactic. Police officers came under attack and we needed to make sure the violence didn't spread out across the London streets.\\" The police came under increasing criticism however, particularly as there were large numbers of children and young teenagers in the crowd, who were held for nearly ten hours in near-zero temperatures. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas brought up the topic in the House of Commons that afternoon, stating: \\"there are many hundreds of students and school children who have been kettled for over four hours and are going to be out there for another several hours, according to the police, in the freezing cold… whatever one thinks of the student protest, [holding people against their will in the contained crowd was] neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective.\\" At a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority the following day, the Metropolitan Police's Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson defended the tactics. He condemned the protest. He was criticised by Jenny Jones, a Green Party member of the London Assembly, who told him: \\"when you imprison thousands of people, which is essentially what you did yesterday, you do have a duty of care to them... You kept people for nine-and-a-half hours. You punished innocent people for going on a protest.\\" A spokesperson for Prime Minister Cameron stated that \\"people have a right to engage in lawful and peaceful protest, but there is no place for violence or intimidation\\", while education minister David Willetts responded by claiming that protesting students did not understand the government's plans. Clegg stated on BBC Radio 2 that \\"I hate in politics, as in life, to make promises that you then find you can't keep. We made a promise we can't deliver – we didn't win the election outright and there are compromises in coalition.\\" Labour Party leader Ed Miliband stated that he would not rule out joining further demonstrations, remarking that \\"I was quite tempted to go out and talk to them [the protesters]. Peaceful demonstrations are part of our society. As Labour leader I am willing to talk to people who are part of them.\\"  30 November  = Central London protests = A number of protesters in central London on 30 November 2010 A third central London protest was organised for Tuesday 30 November, a day that saw cold temperatures and snow in the city. Protesters assembled at Trafalgar Square, but a police line prevented their march down Whitehall towards the Houses of Parliament; the NCAFC accused the Police of \\"pre-emptively block[ing]\\" the protest route. Fearing that they would be kettled in the Square, protesters dispersed throughout the city center, pursued by police. Other officers stood photographing and filming the students for later identification, while police vans blocked off certain streets. Some protesters chanted \\"Peaceful protest! Peaceful protest!\\" and \\"no ifs, no buts, no education cuts\\", and others blew vuvuzelas and played reggae from portable stereo systems. A BBC reporter talked to members of the demonstration, noting that while many desired a peaceful outcome, others believed that violent confrontation with the police was inevitable. Many were angry with how they had been portrayed in the media, with one commenting that confrontation was not caused by \\"hardcore anarchists\\" but by \\"students who are very, very angry.\\" Many protesters ran onto Pall Mall and then past St. James's Park. Denied access to Parliament Square by police, they turned around and headed toward Westminster Abbey. A reporter from The Guardian noted that \\"the march is fracturing – people are going up different streets and getting lost. Texts come through from the front, giving information.\\" The reporter noted that police pursued protesters, and that \\"it feels like 'kiss chase' – or, when I see a policeman punch a boy out of the way, entirely without provocation, 'punch chase'.\\" Many protesters returned to Trafalgar Square, where they were still unable to march down to Whitehall due to the heavy police line. The police kettled those in the Square, whilst some of the protesters waved banners with slogans such as \\"Don't put the kettle on, Mr. Cameron\\" and \\"I Can't Believe It's Not Thatcher\\". The police \\"put lines [of officers] across all the exits\\" to the kettled area of the Square, but reportedly allowed small groups of protesters to leave, even though the majority, around 150 to 200, decided to stay and continue protesting in the snow. Some protesters burned placards and one spray-painted the word \\"Revolution\\" on Nelson's Column. Others threw plastic bottles and fireworks at police lines, and at one point there \\"was a scuffle as a knot of policemen rushed one of the protesters, grabbing him to arrest him, and the crowd flocked angrily to the area.\\" At another time, a group of riot police moved into the crowd of protesters to attempt to secure Nelson's Column, only to be surrounded by demonstrators shouting \\"Who's kettling who? We're kettling you!\\" Other slogans shouted at police during the protest included \\"Shame on you!\\" and \\"Your job's next\\". Police then arrested 146 demonstrators who refused to leave the Square; 139 of them were arrested for breach of the peace, whilst seven were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. Seven more had been arrested in central London earlier in the day. As one reporter noted, \\"above us, on the steps of the National Gallery, tourists look confused at this vision of Britain 2010, angry and fighting in the snow.\\" = Catford protest = Cambridge Old Schools Combination Room during an eleven-day occupation. The night before, on 28 November, a crowd of two to three hundred protesters gathered outside of Lewisham Town Hall in Catford, south London, where a council meeting was then in progress, to protest against wider public sector cuts. Several Youtube videos of the incident were shown on national news, including the BBC. Many of the protesters had come from nearby sixth forms (due to potential Education Maintenance Allowance cuts) and also from Goldsmiths College. Demonstrators, playing music and political slogans from boomboxes forced their way into the building, where a smoke bomb was let off, while another protester climbed onto the roof and unfurled a banner. Several more flares were set off outside and windows smashed, with riot police from the Territorial Support Group close by, were called and several arrests were made. One of the protesters, Sue Luxton, a former Green Party councillor who had subsequently become a teacher, told the press that \\"I wanted to peacefully express my anger at the cuts... People were angry that they couldn't get in.\\" Jeremy Burton, the Lewisham Borough Commander, later told press that \\"unfortunately due to the actions of a minority of people present a number of my officers were injured whilst carrying out their police duties\\", with 16 officers being treated for minor injuries. = Protests elsewhere = On the day of the main demonstration, there were also further protests across the United Kingdom, including in Cardiff, Cambridge, Colchester, Newcastle, Bath, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, York, Manchester, Plymouth, Scunthorpe and Bristol. About 1,500 students, including school children, took part in the protest in Brighton, whilst protests in Bristol involved police being pelted with mustard and ten demonstrators were arrested. In Sheffield, police were pelted with snowballs as they guarded the constituency office of Nick Clegg from a crowd of two hundred protesters. The British protests coincided with those in Italy, where demonstrations occurred in Milan, Turin, Naples, Venice, Palermo, Bari, Genoa, and Rome where riot police were called in to prevent students from gaining access to the parliament building. Meanwhile, whilst occupations that had begun the previous week continued at University College London, Newcastle University and the University of Cambridge, a new one began at the University of Nottingham, where 150 protesters occupied a building. University buildings and local government buildings were occupied in Birmingham and Oxford while police blocked an attempt at occupation of the council building in York. The protesters occupying the council chamber in Birmingham left after four hours, with a police spokesperson commending the protesters for their \\"wholly peaceful\\" behaviour, and noting that it \\"couldn't have been more different from the violent clashes seen recently in London\\".  9 December  =Parliament Square protest= A banner displayed at a student protest in London on 9 December 2010 Protesters mount traffic lights in central London on 9 December 2010 On Thursday 9 December, the day of the scheduled vote on education reform in the Houses of Parliament, two separate protests were organised in central London; one led by the National Union of Students (NUS), the other jointly by the University of London Union (ULU) and the NCAFC, with an expected 40,000 people attending. ULU members handed out green hard hats with the words \\"Tax the banks, not the students\\" on them, whilst a rally was held in Bloomsbury at midday, where ULU President Solomon addressed the crowd. The Metropolitan Police had positioned lines of riot police and police vans along the Houses of Parliament, to prevent any protesters gaining access to it. Superintendent Julia Pendry issued a statement saying: \\"Protesters will be allowed sight and sound of parliament. However, there is evidence to suggest a number of people will come to London intent on causing violence and disorder. They are jumping on the bandwagon of these demonstrations with no intention to protest or interest in student tuition fees… those who are intent on committing crime will also be dealt with and they will suffer the consequences of their actions.\\" The protesters marched from Bloomsbury to Parliament Square in the afternoon, where they pushed down metal barriers and occupied the Square. Around 3:30 pm, police kettled those several thousand protesters in the square, preventing them from leaving, stating that it was necessary \\"due to the level of violence that our officers are facing.\\" Mounted police charged into the crowd on one side of the Square in an attempt to disperse them. A field hospital was set up on the green providing emergency first aid to protesters as well as tea and food within the containment area. Around 30 protesters were treated, most for head injuries. Police used batons to hit protesters, and a St John Ambulance member told press that he had treated ten protesters for head injuries from being struck by police batons by 4.30 pm. One protester, philosophy student Alfie Meadows, suffered a blow to the head from a police truncheon that knocked him unconscious. Taken to hospital, it was discovered that he was suffering from bleeding of the brain, and required brain surgery. Reporter Jonathan Haynes of The Guardian, who was present, characterised the police tactics as \\"very heavy handed\\". Police informed press that they were allowing young and vulnerable protesters to leave the kettle, but those inside the kettle, including journalists, asserted that this was untrue. At 5:41 pm, news reached the protesters that the government had voted to support the proposals. Clashes ensued between the crowd and the police, and the protesters pulled along metal fencing to separate themselves from riot police, who were trying to push them all into the centre of the Square. Later on in the evening, with the protesters still kettled in the Square, protesters smashed all of the windows on the ground floor of Her Majesty's Treasury. At 21:15, the protest was forced onto Westminster Bridge where it was kettled until approximately 23:30. =Protests elsewhere in central London= A British Transport Police officer deployed in riot gear on 9 December 2010 Due to the Parliament Square protest being kettled, many other demonstrators could not enter the Square and so disseminated across much of the rest of central London. Some were separately kettled around The Cenotaph, where Charlie Gilmour, the adopted son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and a student at Girton College, Cambridge, was pictured swinging from a Union Flag on the memorial; he later apologised, claiming that he \\"did not realise\\" it was the Cenotaph. Meanwhile, many of those students who remained around the area of Trafalgar Square continued to protest, with about 150 holding a sit-in in the adjacent National Gallery, while others attempted to set fire to the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree. During the protests, a car taking The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall to the evening's Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium was attacked on Regent Street and Home Secretary Theresa May confirmed a protester 'made contact' with Camilla. In Oxford Street, Topshop was damaged, as rioters sprayed \\"pay your tax\\" on the building and broke windows. = Response = Home Secretary Theresa May issued a statement in which she \\"utterly condemned\\" the actions of the protesters, and declared that \\"What we are seeing in London tonight, the wanton vandalism, smashing of windows, has nothing to do with peaceful protest... Attacks on police officers and property show that some of the protesters have no respect for London or its citizens.\\" Nearly 50 people complained to the IPCC about police behaviour during the various protests held around the country, with the majority directed against the Metropolitan Police, including complaints of violence used against protesters. Following the protests, video footage of Jody McIntyre, who has cerebral palsy, being pulled out of his wheelchair by police, who claimed they were acting in the interest of his own safety (he had positioned himself to the front-line facing the police) was posted to YouTube. The footage showed him being pulled out of his wheelchair and dragged across the ground by officers from the Metropolitan Police during the protests. McIntyre said he had been pulled out of his wheelchair twice; only one incident was shown in the video footage. An interview with McIntyre about the incident by BBC journalist Ben Brown on 13 December 2010 was described by The Guardian newspaper as \\"having a distinct lack of sympathy from the BBC\\" and that the incident had \\"attracted thousands of complaints.\\" Mcintyre's complaint was later rejected by Scotland Yard. His subsequent appeal was partially upheld by the IPCC. Street medics treated student protesters during the parliament square protest on Thursday 9 December, the day of the scheduled vote to raise university tuition fees. A field tent was set up on the green providing emergency first aid to protesters as well as tea and food within the containment area. Around 30 protesters were treated, most for head injuries. Influence On 30 November, following the third main day of protesting, the Welsh Assembly announced that it would not permit an increase in fees for Welsh students. A reporter from the BBC noted that this meant that if the plans went through in England, \\"it would mean that an English student at a university in England could pay more than £17,000 more for a three-year degree than a Welsh student on the same course.\\" . A writer in British newspaper The Guardian, writing several hours before the government vote on the topic, noted that \\"It seems likely the tuition fees bill will pass but I'd still argue that – whatever your view on the merits of the new fees system – the protests have been a success at least in calling politicians to account for broken pledges, something you see rarely theses [sic] days.\\" In July 2011, three school children will challenge the kettling of children at the 24 November 2010 protest. They will seek a Judicial Review in the High Court, arguing in particular that children had a right to protest and that their safety was jeopardised, breaking the laws of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 2004, In November 2012, two years after the 2010 demonstrations, protests ignited again from the student movement. Organised by the NUS, around 10,000 demonstrators marched in central London. After a five-day trial in the High Court in June 2012, 27-year-old assistant tutor Luke Cooper, reported to be completing a PhD in international relations at the University of Sussex, was awarded £35,000 over a front page Evening Standard article and £25,000 over a follow-up piece in the Daily Mail that implied he was the \\"ringleader\\" of the protesters who invaded the Conservative Party's headquarters. Cooper complained that the allegations were untrue, threatened his future academic prospects and left his reputation \\"as badly trashed\\" as the Millbank Tower.

Sarwar was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium-fast. He was born at Lahore, Punjab. Only List A match Sarwar played a single List A match for Lahore Eagles against the National Bank of Pakistan in the 2008/09 Royal Bank of Scotland Cup. The match was a disaster for both the Eagles and Sarwar. Bowled out for just 122 in 40.3 overs, Sarwar remained not out on 0 at the end of the Eagles innings. In reply, National Bank of Pakistan scored the 123 runs required to win in just 6.1 overs, with an innings run-rate of 19.94 runs per over. Sarwar himself was singled out for harsh treatment by the batsman: His 3 overs conceded 78 runs, an economy rate of 26. His 3 overs individually conceded 23, 27 and 28 runs. By the end of their reply Salman Butt was unbeaten on 92 from just 25 balls. Later claims Prior to the match, Eagles captain Zulqarnain Haider was removed from the captaincy amid allegations that he was under pressure to select certain players for the game; he never played for Lahore again. The captaincy then passed to Ahmed Dar, with Sarwar proceeding to be selected. The National Bank of Pakistan needed to win the match convincingly to improve their net run-rate and qualify for the semi- final of the tournament. The outcome of this match was later investigated, but the Pakistan Cricket Board said nothing untoward had been discovered about the match. In November 2010, Haider fled to London from the Pakistan vs South Africa series in Dubai, citing threats from bookmakers after he refused to help fix a One Day International in the series.

The group consists of Adam Dutkiewicz (Killswitch Engage) and Jesse Leach (Killswitch Engage, The Empire Shall Fall, and Seemless) while guitarist Joel Stroetzel (Killswitch Engage), bassist Matt Bachand (rhythm guitarist in Shadows Fall), drummer Dan Gluszak (formerly of Envy on the Coast) complete the touring lineup. An album was planned for 2009. However, the group remained largely inactive until 2010, releasing the single \\"Strength in Numbers\\", with their debut album, titled The Hymn of a Broken Man, released on January 18, 2011 through Roadrunner Records. History Jesse Leach, Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz pictured. =Formation and The Hymn of a Broken Man (2007–2012)= When touring the UK with Killswitch Engage, guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz required emergency surgery on his back. While in the hospital, he wrote new material which he later recorded and demoed at home. Dutkiewicz later contacted former Killswitch Engage bandmate and singer Jesse Leach about writing lyrics and recording vocals feeling that he \\"[doesn't] think [he is] the greatest vocalist and lyricist so [he] wanted a little help in that department.\\" Under the moniker Times of Grace, they began recording material in 2008 with Dutkiewicz stating on the group's Myspace that the songs were \\"an epic mix of Metal/Rock/Pop/Shoe gaze & Punk. All of your metal expectations will be incorrect, we are pushing genre boundaries\\". They hoped to release an album of finished material by the summer of 2009. After completing the recording of material in 2009, Times of Grace returned in 2010 to release their debut album. Dutkiewicz recorded vocals, guitars, bass and drums for the album with Leach providing lead vocals and lyrics. In September, they filmed a video for the single \\"Strength in Numbers\\", with debut album The Hymn of a Broken Man scheduled for release on November 9. However, the album's release was delayed with a new release date of January 18, 2011. When asked if they would be touring in support of the album, Dutkiewicz stated that they would wait until \\"the record [is] released\\" then begin \\"building the band one person at a time.\\" They released videos for the songs \\"Strength in Numbers\\" and \\"Where the Spirit Leads Me\\" before announcing a February tour of the US. Times of Grace's touring lineup was announced in January 2011. Along with Dutkiewicz and Leach, the band consisted of Killswitch Engage guitarist Joel Stroetzel, former Five Pointe O vocalist Daniel Struble playing bass, as well as former Envy on the Coast drummer Dan Gluszak. On May 16, 2011 the band announced that Matt Bachand, guitarist with Shadows Fall, will be joining the band on bass for their tour dates in Europe, as well as their tour supporting Underoath in America. Upon release, The Hymn of a Broken Man charted at number 44 on the Billboard 200, selling nearly 10,000 copies. The band performed at the 2011 Download Festival on the Pepsi Max stage and the 2012 Soundwave Festival in Australia. =Hiatus and the second album (2013–present)= The band has been inactive since vocalist Jesse Leach rejoined Killswitch Engage in February 2012. In 2014, Leach addressed Times of Grace hiatus by saying \\"The future is unwritten with that project, but it's still something that Adam [and I] have in our hearts and our minds.\\" In 2016, the band stated they have material written for five new Times of Grace songs. In December 2017, the band entered the studio recording its follow-up to The Hymn of a Broken Man with former live drummer Dan Gluszak as their new official member of the band. On September 19, 2019, Leach made a post on Instagram saying that he had his bags packed and was about to head out to California to record what he hoped would be the last two recording sessions on Times of Grace's upcoming second album. He said that the lyrics on the upcoming album they are working are \\"the deep, painful and soul searching type that can not be forced or faked\\" and elaborated on how he had to dig deep to get the right words for the songs. On June 24, 2020, Leach confirmed that the band's second album was completed. On June 30, the band posted a video to their official Instagram account featuring Dutkiewicz and Gluszak performing a cover of \\"All I Need\\" by Radiohead.

Biography At the age of three, Robert Schöller discovered art through his mother's paintings and was encouraged to paint when his mother gave him a book with pictures of the world's great paintings. He still claims to consider that book his personal \\"bible\\" of art. Finishing high school at age 15, Schoeller was accepted into an art school in Linz, in order to pursue university-level instruction in preparation for a career in art. He nevertheless focused on creating a personal style of paintings and engravings, combining realism with fantasy, and soon was quite successful with his work. When applying to the Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts in 1968, he showed up at the interview with only two etchings which he had to borrow back from clients, and eventually was told to go and paint on his own because there was not much to teach him, but, he also was invited to join a master's class. One year later, Schöller left this school for going on a trip to Mexico City, Los Angeles and New York City, where he set up a studio and resided for nearly four years. Schöller moved back to Salzburg, Austria, in 1974, where he stayed for two years. On New Year's Day 1976, he moved to Vienna, setting up another studio, continuing painting and doing exhibitions throughout Europe. As a painter, Schöller always was interested in expressing some ‘living essence’ of human beings, depicting emotions, attitudes, and moods rather than sheer faces. Researching various masters' techniques for using oils and resins to create paintings that would stand the test of time, he emerged with innovative new techniques and a refined approach. When Schöller's reputation as a portraitist grew, he got commissions throughout Europe, painting government officials as well as members of the aristocracy, and getting commissions in the USA. In 1986, he was asked by The White House to paint the official portrait of George Washington to commemorate the Bicentennial Celebration of the U.S. Constitution. This painting was made into a poster and was used in local celebrations throughout the country. After that project, Schöller moved to Clearwater, FL, in 1989.

The topography of ancient Rome is a multidisciplinary field of study that draws on archaeology, epigraphy, cartography and philology. The classic English-language work of scholarship is A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (1929), written by Samuel Ball Platner, completed and published after his death by Thomas Ashby. New finds and interpretations have rendered many of Platner and Ashby's conclusions unreliable, but when used with other sources the work still offers insights and complementary information. In 1992, Lawrence Richardson published A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, which builds on Platner and Ashby.This is the assessment of Bill Thayer, a private scholar whose LacusCurtius site has been an online resource for ancient Rome since 1997. For a perspective on Richardson's book for the general reader, see Thayer's review. The six-volume, multilingual Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae (1993‑2000) is the major modern work in the field. History of the discipline =Renaissance beginnings= Ancient Roman topography as a systematic field of study began with the Italian Renaissance. The humanists express both a sense of rupture from the classical past brought about by the \\"Dark Ages\\" and a desire to rediscover antiquity. The renewed interest in classical texts, facilitated by the new technology of the printing press, was paralleled by inquiry into the physical monuments of ancient Rome, coinciding with a contemporary building boom in the city.Overview based on J.G.A. Pocock, Barbarism and Religion: The First Decline and Fall (Cambridge University Press, 2003, 2005), p. 181ff., and Charles L. Stinger, The Renaissance in Rome (Indiana University Press, 1985, 1998), p. 61ff. Among the early topographers of ancient Rome were the 15th-century humanists Poggio Bracciolini and Flavio Biondo. Poggio's De varietate fortunae (\\"On the Vagaries of Fortune\\") was a nostalgic and moralizing evocation of a lost Rome of triumphs, spectacles, and grand monuments, but it also contained detailed descriptions of temples, baths, arches, amphitheaters and other landmarks as artifacts subject to intellectual inquiry, in contrast to medieval mirabilia literature.For examples, see De mirabilibus urbis Romae and Mirabilia Urbis Romae. Poggio researched ancient texts such as Frontinus's work On the Water Supply of the City of Rome and examined inscriptions, compiling a volume of epigraphy from ancient monuments: \\"Through such diligence, Poggio pioneered the way to reconstruct in historically accurate terms the topographical reality of the ancient city.\\"Stinger, The Renaissance in Rome, pp. 61–62. Biondo, like Poggio an Apostolic Secretary, produced a series of volumes surveying the topography of the ancient city as well as Roman Italy: Roma instaurata (1440–46), Italia illustrata (1448–53), and Roma triumphans (1456–60). In these works, Biondo took an antiquarian or archaeological approach, as distinguished from his historical writing in the Decades which influenced Gibbon.Pocock, Barbarism and Religion: The First Decline and Fall (Cambridge University Press, 2003, 2005), pp. 181–185. He organized his material by topic, and not only described and identified gates, obelisks, baths, circuses, and other monuments, but explained their function and purpose. Among his literary and documentary sources were Livy's history of Rome, the letters of Pliny, Varro's De lingua latina, Festus, the regionary catalogues, and the newly discovered manuscripts of Tacitus and Frontinus.Stinger, The Renaissance in Rome, pp. 62–63. Although Renaissance researchers did not engage in archaeological digs, the archaeological and topographical perspective was fundamental to humanism, and they were alert to finds of antiquities. Biondo, for instance, was able to locate the atrium of the Theater of Pompey after a Roman lawyer who was having his wine cellar enlarged found a massive block of dressed stone inscribed with cubit-high letters reading Genius theatri Pompeiani.Stinger, The Renaissance in Rome, pp. 62–63. Biondo's methodology and use of textual sources influenced the archaeological, antiquarian, and topographical study of ancient Rome among his fellow humanists for the next 80 years. Among these were Pomponius Leto, who edited the Notitia regionum Urbis based in part on his experience as a tour guide; Bernardo Rucellai, with his compilation De Urbe Roma; and Andrea Fulvio, who published his massive Antiquitates Urbis in the spring of 1527, just before the sack.Stinger, The Renaissance in Rome, p. 63. The successor to Biondo's work was the seven-volume Antiquae Romae topographia of Bartolomeo Marliani, first published in May 1534,Harry B. Evans, Aqueduct Hunting in the Seventeenth Century: Raffaello Fabretti's De aquis et aquaeductibus veteris Romae (University of Michigan Press, 2002), p. 13. but riddled with typographical errors. Bartolomeo credited the collaboration of various scholars, singling out Annibale Caro. The work was republished in a corrected, augmented second edition in 1544, as Urbis Romae topographia and rededicated, this time to Francis I of France. It was this second edition that was often reprinted, complete and in epitomes, and translated into the modern languages of Europe. But the first edition was the basis for an edition published the same year at Lyon, that was thoroughly revised and augmented by François Rabelais and dedicated to Jean du Bellay, with whom Rabelais had been staying in Rome in March through April 1534, just before Marliani's Topographia appeared; it would appear that Rabelais had contact with Marliani.Massimiliano Albanese, \\"MARLIANI (Marliano), Bartolomeo (Giovanni Bartolomeo\\" in Dizionario biografico degli Italiani See also A category of articles that deal with this subject may be found at :Category:Topography of the ancient city of Rome. * 14 regions of Augustan Rome * Vicus (Rome) * Forum (Roman) * Imperial fora * Architecture of ancient Rome * Forma Urbis Romae * Roman temple * Seven hills of Rome Lists: * List of ancient monuments in Rome * List of aqueducts in the city of Rome * List of obelisks in Rome * List of parks and gardens in Rome Notes Further reading * Aicher, Peter J. 2004.

During Ruaidrí's lifetime the territory of Sliabh Lugha was conquered by the Sheriff of Connacht, Jordan de Exeter (died 1258), ancestor of the Clan Mac Siúrtáin. Sliabh Lugha would from this time become known as Tir Mac Síurtáin (Mac Jordan's Country), in time becoming the barony of Gallen. As a result of this, the Clan Ó Gadhra were forced north into Cuil Ui Fionn (barony of Coolavin, County Sligo), which would become their new home. The Annals of the Four Masters record a number of incidents concerning the Ó Gadhra family during Ruaidhri's reign: * M1228.2. A great war broke out in Connaught between the two sons of Roderic O'Conor, Hugh and Turlough, after the death of the Hugh above-mentioned, for the younger son did not yield submission to the elder; and they destroyed Connaught between them, and desolated the region extending from Easdara Ballysadare, southwards, to the river of Hy-Fiachrach, excepting only a small portion of Sliabh Lugha, and the territory of the people of Airtech. * M1228.5. Murtough, the son of Flaherty O'Flanagan, was slain by the sons of Teige O'Gara. * M1237.9. A prey was taken by Conor, son of Cormac, from Rory O'Gara, and Rory's brother was slain. * M1241.8. Teige, the son of Rory O'Gara, died. In 1256, Ruaidhri was slain by David, son of Richard Cuisin, who was apparently of the family that would go on to produce Ádhamh Cúisín, a scribe and genealogist who lived c. 1400 and was a compiler of Leabhar Ua Maine.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977. In 1985 it was included as a contributing property in the Vander Veer Park Historic District. History In the early 1890s, the Rev. A.M. Judy of First Unitarian Church saw a need for a place for the young people of his congregation to gather for recreation and sporting activities. He enlisted the support of the Unity Club and they found that the estate of J.D. Brewster on Brady Street near Central Park, now Vander Veer Park, was available. The house would serve as a clubhouse and the grounds were large enough to support tennis and a variety of field sports. Citizens from the larger community expressed interest. Davenport's social elite took up Judy's idea and transformed what was a simple recreational facility and made it into an exclusive club by selling subscriptions. with In June 1891, subscriptions to participate in the club began, and the required 300 were realized by July. The former Brewster residence was purchased and the club was organized. As the club grew, outdoor concerts and dances were held. A bowling alley and shooting gallery were added. A larger clubhouse was required and a Colonial Revival structure was built in 1903. It included dining rooms, smoking and billiard rooms, a reading room and a ballroom. A fire destroyed the building in April 1905, but it was rebuilt and opened in July of the same year. Davenport architect Parke T. Burrows was responsible for the designs of the present building. The club has continued to grow over the years and it has expanded its facilities and activities. Architecture The historic designation includes two buildings, the main clubhouse and the bowling alley. Both are of frame construction. The 1905 clubhouse is a square, two-story structure that is capped with a hipped roof. The main facade features a large tetrastyle portico with columns in a Renaissance Ionic style. The opening between the two center columns is extremely wide to visually show off the wide front entrance. The cornices are bracketed, and the tympana has a semi-circular fanlight with radiating tracery. There are pilasters at the junction of the portico with the house that terminate at the second-floor level. A wide porch is located on the west and on a portion of the south elevations of the clubhouse. It forms a terrace on the second floor. The porch is supported by attenuated Tuscan columns. A porte-cochere is located on the south elevation. The north elevation had a portico similar to the west elevation, but it was replaced by a later addition. The bowling alley is older than the main clubhouse, having been built sometime in the 1890s. It was originally a two-story structure, but it was struck by lightning in 1916 and remodeled into a single-story structure. The second story had housed billiard and card rooms. The building houses four bowling alleys. The pins were set by hand until 1976. The main facade is divided into nine bays. The entrances are located at the two ends of the rectangular structure and extend slightly beyond the main wall to form end pavilions. The doorways are framed by architraves that are capped with flat pediments. Paired Corinthian pilasters frame the ends of the pavilions. The windows in the center bays where the bowling allies are located are divided into four unequal sections by a Latin-cross sash.

The Northwest Davenport Turner Society Hall is significant for its association with Davenport's German community, which was the city's largest and most influential immigrant group. It also played an important role in the civic and cultural life of the northwest Davenport German community. History Central Turner Hall (1888) S.E. corner of Third & Ripley Streets =Turners= Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (1778–1852) was a teacher in Berlin who started outdoor physical education classes in 1811. His twin goals were to promote physical fitness and German nationalism. Over the next three decades gymnastic societies known as Turnvereins opened in many German cities. Their members were known as “Turners”, the German word for gymnasts. The societies also served as gathering places for people who desired democratic reforms in the governments of the various German states. They supported the revolution that began in 1848 and when it failed they fled to the United States, and many came to Davenport. =The Turners in Davenport= Among those who came to Davenport were Theodor Gülich and Christian Müller, and their arrival led to the foundation of the Turner society in the city in 1852. Gülich's father and grandfather were active in the Schleswig-Holstein movement prior to the rebellion. He stated in 1854 at the Turner's first large public event that the local society would fight against nativism and the domination of the church. It would also work to promote freedom, education and well-being for all people. The early Turner's in Davenport took a progressive stand on social issues such as women's rights. They were also promoters of the German Free School Society in Davenport. Many of the early members also had a desire to return to the German states to continue the revolutionary struggle. Initially, the local Turner society was called the Sozialistischer Turnverein (Socialistic Turner Society). While they were harsh critics of American society, they strove to be good Americans. They expected any potential member to become an American citizen before joining. They also participated in the annual Fourth of July celebrations. At the centennial celebration in 1876, however, they stayed true to their anticlerical convictions and left the procession when a prayer was added to the festivities. As time went on, however, their radical attitudes subsided and they gradually abandoned their hopes of returning to Germany. In 1858 the organization changed its name to the Davenporter Turnverein and in 1882 it was changed to the Davenporter Turngemeinde. With the second wave of German immigration in the 1870s, the number of Turner societies in Davenport grew from one to three. The original Northwest Turner building that was destroyed in a fire. =Northwest Turners= The Northwest Davenport Turner Society was established in 1871 and their first meeting place was Jacobsen's Hall at Locust and Division Streets, which was a combination boarding house and tavern. with It was destroyed in a fire on July 4, 1882 and a new building was constructed soon after at 16th and Washington Streets. The Turner Hall continued to serve the physical and mental exercise of its members. Folk festivals were also held in an adjoining garden. The society continued to expand as did German immigration to the city. In 1904 the Turners expanded their hall and they hired Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen, himself a Schleswig-Holstein native. It was renovated yet again in 1926 and it was the work of Clausen's son Rudolph, who continued his father's firm under the name of Clausen, Kruse and Klein. Both the East and Northwest Turners continued to function in Davenport until at least the 1980s. The Northwest Davenport Turner Society sold their building in 1991 and it became Uncle Roscoe's Polo Club. In 1994 it was sold to the Mohassan Grotto, a Masonic organization. They used the building for bingo games that the organization used for fundraising. In 2017 Compassion Church acquired the building and uses it as a site for their breakfast ministry, known as Timothy's House of Hope. The Northwest Turners continue to operate, however, they are an organization without a hall. The membership currently meets at a variety of local venues and they sponsor bowling and golf teams. East Davenport Turner Hall =Turners in Scott County= At one time there were five Turner halls in Scott County. Two of the other halls were in Davenport. The Central Turner Hall was located at 401 W. Third St. near Washington Square on the west side of downtown. Built in 1888, it was the second largest Turner Hall in the United States. The building was damaged in a fire in 1961 and torn down in 1975 to make way for senior citizen housing. The East Turner Hall (1891) continues to stand in the Village of East Davenport and is in use as a theater. The Turner hall in Buffalo (1869) was destroyed in a fire in 1961 and the one in Eldridge (c. 1885) was destroyed in a fire in 2013. Architecture The main block of the 1882 building was nearly square in its proportions. It was two stories tall and four bays wide and deep. It was capped with a hipped roof with bracketed eaves, and the roof deck was edged with iron cresting. There was a small gabled dormer centered above the main facade. The main entrance into the facility was located to the right of center and was surrounded by a flat frame that was capped with a shallow, triangular pediment. The gymnasium extended off the back of the main block. Like the main block, it was a frame structure, and it measured by . Unlike the main block, it was capped with a gable roof. The 1904 addition added three more bays to the north side of the main block. The original dormer was removed and two small triangular dormers flanked a projecting bay on the second floor. It culminated in a spire with flared eaves. Window treatment on the second floor of the addition matched the original structure. The first-floor windows were triple-storefront windows that flanked a secondary entrance. The main entrance into the facility was placed beneath the projecting bay. The original gymnasium was renovated into a combination movie theater and dance hall. A new gymnasium was attached to the west of the original. It is a brick structure built on a stone foundation and a raised basement. It has a gable roof whose ends culminate in shallow shoulder parapets. The side walls are four bays wide and are divided by flat engaged brick piers and corbelling across the top. The 1926 renovation saw the alteration of the main facade. The windows on the first floor were enlarged, and plate glass windows replaced the double-hung sashes. The projecting bay over the main entrance and its spire was replaced by a hipped-roof dormer. The iron cresting was removed from the roof deck. A full basement was dug under the wood portion of the building. The front part of the building, which faced Washington Street, became two storefronts. The second floor was converted into an apartment. The main entrance opened into a hallway between the storefronts that lead to the auditorium/dance hall.

Twitchfilm reviewer Ard Fijn gave it a positive review saying: \\"Shinya Tsukamoto has made a very impressive film with some strong statements about loss and grief, and has wrapped this in a fantasy horror mystery thriller. People expecting a regular entry from one of those four genres are in for either a rude awakening or a pleasant surprise. For me \\"Nightmare Detective 2\\" was a pleasant surprise, but many people I spoke with after the viewing were less enamored by the convoluted story.\\"http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2009/02/iffr-2009-nightmare- detective-2-review.php Japancinema reviewed the film positively, stating: \\"Nightmare Detective 2 can actually be viewed as a stand alone film, however, watching the original first is always advisable. One big hurdle for viewers to overcome is the fact that this film is jam-packed with ambiguity from start to finish but I urge you not to be driven to frustration. The first film had a visceral brutality to it, as this one on the other hand, can be described as a slow ride into silent darkness.http://japancinema.net/2010/08/04/nightmare- detective-2-review/\\" and suggested that a third film would be welcolmed. Rowthree.com gave the film 4 out of a possible 5 and also commented that he would embrace a third movie, \\"I for one truly hope that Tsukamoto and Matsuda will return one final time and wrap the story up in a trilogy.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984. History Northwest Davenport Savings Bank was established in Davenport around 1910. The Neoclassical style structure was designed by Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling. The building was completed in 1912 in a German-American neighborhood in what was then the northwest corner of the city of Davenport. Its founders were of German-American descent, and lived and operated businesses in the same commercial district. Dr. Jacob S. Weber, a physician, served as the banks first president; Peter Peters, a local merchant, was the first vice-president; and William Burmann was the cashier. with It was one of five banks that were still active in the city when President Franklin Roosevelt declared the Bank Holiday in 1933. The others included: American Commercial and Savings Bank, Bechtel Trust Company, Union Savings Bank and Trust, and Home Savings Bank.Svendsen, 5-5. Only two banks survived, American Commercial and Bechtel, but under new names. On July 7, 1941, Northwest Bank and Trust Company began business in the building. They occupied the structure until 1953 when they moved to their current location on the corner of West Locust and Washington Streets. Architecture The banking industry in Davenport enjoyed significant growth from around 1900 to 1915. The new buildings that were built by them in this era expressed this growth both downtown and in the newly established neighborhood branch banks. For the most part, they were built in some version of the Neoclassical style. This small bank building is a relatively simple single-story brick structure. It is built on a concrete block foundation. The building features engaged columns in the Doric order that support a full entablature and triangular pediment, and pilasters that are topped with egg-and-dart molding on the classically detailed caps. The main entrance has been partially filled in to create a smaller doorway. A small addition was also added to the south side of the building at a later date.

He is also affiliated with the Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy and the Higgins Labor Studies Program. Best known for his work on the connections between politics and human happiness, his research also encompasses democratic theory, political economy, and the study of organized labor.  Education and career  Radcliff attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he obtained a B.A. in 1984. He graduated from there in 1991 with a Ph.D. in Political Science. While he has held faculty appointments at Rutgers University and Vanderbilt University, the majority of his academic career has been spent at the University of Notre Dame. He has been a fellow at the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities and at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. In 2014 he was in residence as a Fulbright U.S. Scholar at the Roosevelt Study Center, in the Netherlands.  Early research  In a series of scholarly articles in the 1990s, Radcliff attempted a radical reinterpretation of the implications for democratic thought of social theory in general, and Arrow's impossibility theorem in particular. Rather than the familiar suggestion, associated most closely with the work of William H. Riker, that Arrow's work suggested that democracy must by logical necessity be limited to the minimal form associated with classical Liberalism, Radcliff argued that social choice theory actually supported more robust or populistic conceptions of democracy.\\"Liberalism, Populism, and Collective Choice.\\" Political Research Quarterly 46: 127-142. 1992.\\"Majority Rule and Impossibility Theorems.\\" Social Science Quarterly 73: 511-522. 1992.\\"The General Will and Social Choice Theory.\\" Review of Politics 54: 34-49. 1992. This work culminated in a 2000 article in The Journal of Politics that sought to establish that the only democratic models to survive the challenges posed by social choice theory were in fact the radical interpretations of democracy known as participatory democracy or deliberative democracy.\\"Preference Aggregation, Functional Pathologies, and Participation: A Social Choice Defense of Participatory Democracy\\" (with Ed Wingenbach). The Journal of Politics 62: 977-998. 2000. This article won the award for best article published in The Journal of Politics in that year. During this same period, Radcliff (sometimes in collaboration with his colleague Alexander Pacek of Texas A&M; University) produced a series of empirical articles focusing, among other things, on the connections between organized labor, political participation, the welfare state, and electoral outcomes in the industrial democracies and across the American States.  Current research  Radcliff's recent work has focused on the social scientific study of happiness within the multi-disciplinary field sometimes labeled as happiness economics. In a 2001 article in the American Political Science Review he provided extensive econometric evidence in support of the contention that social democracy in general, and an expansive, universalistic welfare state in particular, contributed to greater levels of life satisfaction across the Western world. He concludes that the principal determinant of quality of life, controlling for economic or cultural conditions which might also play a role, is the degree to which a society protects its citizens against impersonal market forces as measured by the degree of decommodification it provides.\\"Politics, Markets, and Life Satisfaction: The Political Economy of Human Happiness.\\" American Political Science Review 95: 939-952. (with Alexander Pacek) 2001. This general theme was developed in a series of subsequent papers, which extended these conclusions by using different indicators (such as happiness as well as life satisfaction),\\"Welfare Policy and Subjective Well-Being Across Nations: An Individual-Level Analysis.\\" Social Indicators Research 89: 179-191 (with Alexander Pacek). 2008. employing pooled time series analysis over a larger number of countries\\"Assessing the Welfare State: the Politics of Happiness.\\" Perspectives on Politics 6: 267-277. (with Alexander Pacek) 2008. and other methodological and theoretical innovations. In his most recent major paper on the subject, Radcliff and colleagues extend this analysis to a comparative study of the American states, showing that life satisfaction is promoted, controlling for other factors, by the state's level of welfare spending, the degree of economic regulation in favor of workers or consumers, and its history of rule by liberal (or Democratic) state governments.\\"The Politics of Happiness: On the Political Determinants of Quality of Life in the American States.\\" Alvarez-Diaz, A., Gonzalez, L., and Radcliff, B. The Journal of Politics 72 (3): 894-905. 2010. Radcliff has also devoted a series of papers to the role that labor organization plays in promoting human happiness. His empirical analyses suggest that two fundamental conclusions: (1) individuals who belong to (or are represented by) labor unions have higher levels of life satisfaction that others of similar income, education, age, gender, marital status, physical health, and other similar factors, and, more importantly (2) that the aggregate level of labor organization—the \\"density\\" of organization, meaning the percentage of the work force organized—appears to increase subjective appraisal of life for everyone, whether members of unions or not.

Radcliff's work on happiness and the welfare state has been the subject of an extensive critique by the political scientist Tom Rice and colleagues, who in particular questions the direction of causality in Radcliff's empirical results, suggesting that it may be that happier citizens are simply more supportive of the welfare state rather than the welfare state producing happier people.Happiness, Economics, and Politics.

It was written by staff writer Meg Jackson and directed by Brian Kirk. Nucky attends the Republican National Convention in Chicago, while Eli fills in for him in Atlantic City.  Plot  Nucky visits Chicago for the 1920 Republican National Convention, where he finds himself intrigued by the candidacy of Warren G. Harding over more established candidates. Nucky meets Harding's mistress, Nan Britton, and promises his campaign manager the votes of the New Jersey delegation in exchange for blocking Senator Walter Evans Edge's nomination for the vice-presidency, knowing that his former ally has secretly sided against him in funding new roads for Jersey City rather than Nucky's own Atlantic City. Nucky stops by Torrio's brothel to find more information on Harding. As Nucky talks to Torrio and a judge from Ohio, Jimmy comes downstairs and runs into his old patron. Nucky behaves coldly towards Jimmy, criticizing him for never writing to his family, unaware that Van Alden, working out of Atlantic City's post office, has been intercepting the steady stream of money and letters Jimmy sends to Angela. Back home, while collecting money at Nucky's casino, Eli walks into an armed robbery. He is shot and wounded by the D'Alessio gang, who planned the heist with Luciano and Lansky. When Nucky learns of Eli's injury, he returns to Torrio's brothel and asks Jimmy to come back to Atlantic City, reminding him that, as an Irishman among Italians, Jimmy will always be an outsider in Torrio's crew. Nucky stresses that he needs Jimmy's help in the intensifying turf war against Rothstein and the Italians, offering a percentage share in his smuggling operations and help in dealing with Van Alden's investigation of Jimmy's heist. Jimmy is noncommittal, although later he looks on wistfully as Torrio and his men laugh and joke in Italian. Van Alden's wife, desiring a child even though she is infertile, pressures him to provide money for an operation he cannot afford. He gathers all the money he has intercepted from Jimmy, then mails an envelope to his wife. However, it is soon revealed that he has actually passed the money along to Angela; Van Alden's wife breaks down in tears as she reads the letter confirming his decision to trust in God's will rather than get her an operation. Rothstein prepares for legal trouble over his role in the Black Sox Scandal. Margaret finds herself entangled in Nucky's affairs when he calls from Chicago and asks her to watch over his office and, without opening them, hide certain documents in the chaotic aftermath of the casino robbery. Margaret spends the entire night sitting at Nucky's desk, reading a ledger that details his profits from bootlegging.

Ahab sends for Jezebel, however, and commands Jehu, his captain, to escort her caravan safely to Jezreel. Once Jehu meets Jezebel, he immediately becomes attracted to her and she confuses him for Ahab. Jezebel finally arrives at Jezreel and is greeted by Ahab who, stunned by her beauty, provides her with an individual chamber until they marry. On her wedding night, Jezebel evades Ahab and pursues Jehu, whom she seduces. Jezebel establishes the cult of Baal, her idol, in Israel and builds a temple. Jehovah, the God of the Israelites, delivers drought upon Israel because of the idolatry and sends his prophet Elijah to reprimand the people. Elijah prays to Jehovah and the drought ends.

In an interview with Build LDN, MNEK talked about his introduction into music and the industry and how, at first, he did not even know what a publisher was. He stated, \\"I started writing poems and writing songs around the age of 8 or 7 and I started playing around with production software from really young as well. I then put some stuff up on Myspace finally when I was 14. There were two songs I had. I sent them out to all my favourite artists on Myspace and it just landed on this artist at the time called CocknBullKid, but she's now Anita Blay and she's an amazing songwriter. She was like \\"Okay, cool. I'm just gonna send this to my publisher\\" and at the time I had no idea what a publisher was. So she sent it and that was that and it became this flurry of people wanting to be my publisher and then that was me in the industry, but then I've had to grow in the industry at the same time - I've been learning on the job - because I was still in school and all that stuff. I was managing how to work that around it because my parents weren't gonna let me leave school.\\" In 2011, when he was 16, he began writing and working with production group Xenomania and contributed to Florrie's 2011 extended play Experiments, which first labelled him professionally as a songwriter.

However, \\"Gay and lesbian members who choose to be, and remain, [sexually] abstinent should be given the opportunity to participate in all church activities including leadership positions in the Church. Those who struggle with temptation to sin should be treated the same way as other members who struggle with sexual sin (Matt 18:4; Mark 2:17; Luke 5:31; 19:10). We strongly affirm that homosexual persons have a place in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\\" https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/sem-books/27/, pp 17-18, October 9, 2015 The Church's opposition to same-gender sexual practices and relationships is on the grounds that \\"sexual intimacy belongs only within the marital relationship of a man and a woman.\\" https://www.adventist.org/en/information/official- statements/statements/article/go/-/homosexuality/, October 17, 2012 The Church believes the Bible consistently affirms the pattern of heterosexual monogamy, and all sexual relations outside the scope of heterosexual marriage are contrary to God's original plan. Although there are individual churches that welcome openly LGBT people, such as the Hollywood Seventh-Day Adventist Church and the Crosswalk Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference remains opposed to this. History The Seventh-day Adventist Church's position on homosexuality has been progressive. When a gay marriage bill came before the California legislature in April 2004, Adventist church members were urged to contact their representatives and voice their opposition. In the September/October, 2004, issue of church periodical, Liberty, which was devoted to the issue of gay marriage, the religious liberty director called for the church not to remain silent in opposing gay rights.Barry Bussey, \\"Why Silence is Not an Option,\\" Liberty, September–October, 2004 In \\"The Liberty Blog\\" the religious liberty director for the North American Division of the Adventist church argued against the proposed federal \\"Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007,\\" suggesting it could have an indirect impact on free speech, would give special protection to some crime victims while failing to cover others, would be unnecessary since local laws already provide protection against hate crimes, and could lead to marginalizing those who oppose homosexual practice.http://www.religiousliberty.info/blog/index.php?paged=3, June 28, 2007 In October 2015 the Adventist church published a statement of its acceptance of homosexually-inclined members who abstain from openly homosexual behaviour in accordance with the Bible [see \\"Church statements regarding homosexuality\\" below].

According to the Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, one reason for church discipline includes, \\"Such violations as fornication, promiscuity, incest, homosexual practice, sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults, and other sexual perversions, and the remarriage of a divorced person, except of the spouse who has remained faithful to the marriage vow in a divorce for adultery or for sexual perversions.\\"Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, page 194 Independent Church ministries The Seventh-day Adventist church was involved with Colin Cook's Homosexuals Anonymous in the 1980s. Some independent adventist ministries such as 3ABN and Amazing Facts have been supporting a ministry known as Coming out Ministries, run by a number of ex- gay people, including Michael Carducci and Wayne Blakely, who have now been celibate for a number of years, and a pastor who is now in a heterosexual marriage, Ron Woolsey. Coming out ministries is a conversion therapy ministry. They claim to help deliver people from homosexuality, which is a form of so called \\"pseudo-science\\" that has been discredited by health organizations such as the American Psychological Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other health organizations. Uganda Controversy On December 17, 2012, the Ugandan daily newspaper New Vision published an article reporting that the Adventist church president for East and Central Africa, Blaisious Ruguri, had delivered a speech at Mbarara SDA Church in which he declared that Adventists \\"fully\\" supported the government's \\"Anti- Homosexuality Bill\\" (which criminalized same-sex intimacy with lengthy prison terms and demanded the death penalty for repeat offenders. The article, which includes a photo of Ruguri standing alongside state MP Medard Bitekyerezo, quotes Ruguri saying: :\\"Our stand is 'zero tolerance' to this vice and to western influence on this crucial issue because God says no to it. We are together with the President and the Speaker and we fully support the Anti- Homosexuality Bill. I call upon all religious ministers, all Ugandans, and all Africans to say no to Homosexuality. Let us stand for our sovereignty as Ugandans and as God fearing people even the heavens fall.\\" : On December 19, the president of Kinship International, Yolanda Elliott, sent a letter to Adventist world church president, Ted Wilson, and to the church's public relations officer, Garret Caldwell, that read in part: :\\"Through Pr. Ruguri’s statements and the Adventist church’s continued membership in the Inter- Religious Council of Uganda, the church is now justifying the prosecution, imprisonment, and potential execution of Ugandan LGBT people and their families. As Adventists, and regardless of the church’s statements on human sexuality, we believe that the Seventh-day Adventist church should never stand for the violation of basic human rights. The recent End It Now campaign is just the latest example of our church’s track record of standing against violence and abuse. Because of that track record, we do not accept that one of the church’s top-ranking leaders can support legalized violence against a minority group or use the pulpits and authority of the worldwide church to do so.\\" : On December 21, the Adventist News Network in Silver Spring, Maryland issued a press release saying that the New Vision article did not \\"convey an accurate representation of his [Ruguri's] intentions or the voted position of the church regarding homosexuality.\\" The ANN article quoted Ruguri declaring he had no knowledge of the contents of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill and that the newspaper had misrepresented his actual views: :\\"It is unfortunate that the media took the liberty to extend my statements to suggest what I did not say or imply. I have never seen that bill. Mine was a general statement to disapprove of homosexual practice and behavior. Our church is a ministry of mercy, and as a minister in the Seventh-day Adventist Church I cannot condemn homosexuals to death or to hell.\\" Jamaican Adventist Politicians and Criminalization of Homosexuality In July 2012, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Jamaica's newly elected Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, urging her to take stronger action than her predecessors to protect the basic human rights of homosexuals in the country. According to HRW, in the eight years since its 2004 report, \\"Hated to Death: Homophobia, Violence, and Jamaica's HIV/AIDs Epidemic,\\" \\"attacks on homosexual people or people perceived as being homosexual or transgender appear to remain commonplace.\\" Jamaica is widely described by rights organizations as among the most dangerous places in the world to be a homosexual, with the authorities often turning a blind eye to assaults and murders of gays, lesbians, and their allies. With more than a quarter of a million Seventh-day Adventists, Jamaica also has among the highest percentages of Adventists of any country in the world. Approximately 10% of all Jamaicans are Adventist. Numerous Adventists have served in prominent positions in government. In a November 2011 interview with a Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, Seventh-day Adventist and then-Prime Minister Andrew Holness rejected calls from Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron that he repeal Jamaica's \\"anti-buggery\\" laws, which criminalize same- sex intimacy with jail times of up to 10 years. Holness served as Prime Minister of Jamaica from October 2011 until January 2012, when he was succeeded by Simpson-Miller. During the 2011 election debates, Holness and Simpson-Miller were both asked whether they would be willing to include homosexuals in their cabinets. Simpson-Miller replied that \\"Our administration believes in protecting human rights of all Jamaicans. No one should be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation...people should be appointed to positions based on their ability to manage.\\" Holness, by contrast, made clear that he would not permit homosexuals to serve in his government as long as the public remained hostile to gay rights. \\"My sentiments reflect the sentiments of the country,\\" he said. \\"The prime minister has a discretion, but that discretion can not be exercised in a vacuum.\\" In August 2013, the Jamaica Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists published an article on its website under the heading \\"Same-sex marriage is not a human rights issue\\", stating that the Adventist Church in Jamaica has \\"been very strident in its opposition of any softening or repealing of the buggery law.\\" Another prominent Jamaican Adventist politician who has spoken against gay rights is Governor-General Sir Patrick Allen. In a November 2012 address, he urged his countrymen to follow the example of the biblical prophet Nehemiah, who demonstrated \\"zero tolerance of corruption and determined action to stamp it out.\\" Allen lamented \\"a significant change for the worse...what is referred to as the 'new norm.' The trend began with the banning of prayer in schools and later, in state institutions in the former bastion of Christianity, the USA, under the banner of freedom of religion.\\" He continued, \\"There is mounting pressure on states such as Jamaica to recognize specific rights for lesbians and gays, with even threat of withholding financial assistance from those who do not.\\" According to Allen, however, \\"there is nothing wrong with Jamaica which cannot be fixed by what is right with Jamaica.\\"  The Netherlands Union Conference  The Netherlands Union Conference has encouraged all of the churches under their conference to be a safe place to go and discouraged church in the Netherlands Union Conference due to concerns about the safety of LGBT individuals \\"Although we acknowledge the biblical ideal of a monogamous, heterosexual relationship, we continue to emphasise that it is an ideal. The basis of Christianity is that all people fall short of God's ideal; this is why we require God's grace and Christ's sacrifice. This leads to the conclusion that we, as Christians, must welcome all children of God – who all fall short of God's ideal – into our churches with love.\\"  Andrews University  Andrews University has been put on the anti LGBT Shame List due to the cupcake controversy which stopped a bake sale of students who wanted to help Project Fierce with the students saying that this is not about theology. Andrews University's response was that while they value LGBT people and recognize that probably 40% of homeless people are LGBT, they oppose perceived LGBT advocacy of same-sex relationships. Aull4One has raised $17,480 for Project Fierce outside of Andrews university campus and has raised money online; LGBT students were divided on the controversy.

Auburn Athletics also experienced unprecedented facilities enhancements during that time as well, including but not limited to the construction of Samford Stadium-Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park, Jane B.

It is a version of The Office, a 2001-2003 British sitcom that had already been remade in nine other countries (see The Office#Counterparts). HaMisrad is a mockumentary set in a branch of the fictional \\"Paper Office\\" (in English) office supplies company, in the industrial city of Yehud. The series stars Dvir Benedek as Avi Meshulam, the branch's regional manager, a character based heavily on the character of David Brent in the original series. It is co-produced by Yes and July August Productions. Like the original series and many of its spinoffs, HaMisrad lampoons office life as well as gender and ethnic relations. In the case of HaMisrad, the office and warehouse include native-born secular Jews, Arabs, Orthodox Jews, and Russian and Ethiopian immigrants.Gay Arab pokes at prejudices in Israel's version of 'The Office', Paula Hancocks, CNN, October 7, 2010 The first season aired from August to November 2010. Most of the episodes in the first season were based on the 12 episodes from the British series. Many of the early episodes featured identical plots and some of the same dialogue, though as the season went on the episodes' plots diverged increasingly from the originals. A second season aired in late 2012 and early 2013. It contained all original plots. The series is broadcast in HD. Production The series' writer is Uzi Weill, and the director is Eitan Tzur. Both are Israeli television veterans, who had both previously written and directed for BeTipul, an Israeli drama series that was itself adapted in various countries, including the American series In Treatment.An equal opportunity offender, David Brinn, The Jerusalem Post, November 5, 2010 HaMisrad was created with the approval of the British series' co-creators, Ricky Gervais (who starred in the original) and Stephen Merchant. Gervais, when asked about the Israeli series after it was first announced in early 2009, said he was \\"thrilled\\" about the idea, adding wryly, \\"who ever heard of Jewish entertainers?\\"Yossi Brent? 'The Office' to get Israeli version, Ruta Kupfer, Ha'aretz, March 31, 2009 By agreement with the BBC, the main characters had to match the main characters of the UK series, and the first three episodes had to correspond to the UK series' first three episodes. Weill decided to pattern the series even more closely than required on the original UK series, because he felt it was \\"an official satire\\" which \\"had a lot to say about the world and about people.\\" By contrast, Weill did not want to emulate the American version, which he considered \\"a parody about funny people in a funny place with a lot of feel-good factors thrown in.\\" Weill described his approach to adapting the source material as \\"In an English or American office, you would keep your views to yourself, but here, all the racial and religious aspects of our lives are out in the open. We’re constantly talking about it – it's why you come to work! So to create an embarrassing situation, you have to take it further comedy-wise. It's not based on 'what would happen if I say this totally horrible thing' because I've already said it. Instead, it's 'what will happen after I say it?'\\" Characters * Avi Meshulam (Dvir Benedek) – Regional Manager.

Avi's former secretary decides to press a criminal sexual harassment charge against Avi, which causes the company to decide to fire Avi instead. After Yelena tells him the news, Avi puts the signed release forms in the shredder instead of handing them over to her, which forces the company to keep the Yehud branch and terminate the Kiryat Ono one instead.

Dana decides to leave as well, in order to study painting; Yossi suggests to Dana that they get an apartment together, since they're both looking for a new place, and Dana agrees. At the farewell party for Avi at a bar that night, Avi alienates his journalist co-author, and finds out that the motivational-speaking company is not interested in employing him. (Loosely based on Episode 12 of the UK Office, \\"Interview\\".) * Episode 15 – It is around two weeks later, and Avi is an unsuccessful travelling salesman, living out of his car. He visits the office, but gets little reaction, and Yariv informs him that he has gotten a raise over Avi's old salary. Dana and Yossi are both still at the office, near the end of their two weeks' notice. Regev goes into Yariv's office to complain about Yariv's sexual harassment of Shiri, they get into an argument and Yariv fires Regev. Yariv then also fires Ababa and Sami in quick succession when he feels a lack of respect from both of them. Yelena finds out about the firings, then un-fires the three and demotes Yariv back to his old position.

Reception Critics were overall very positive about the first season of HaMisrad. Entertainment writer Aviad Pohoryles of Maariv called the final episode of the season excellent, and said that it provided a worthy response to those who have criticized the importing of non-Israeli television formats.HaMisrad review, Aviad Pohoryles, Maariv, November 17, 2010 (in Hebrew) Reviewers Udi Hirsch and Inav Schiff of Israeli web portal Walla! called the show the best thing on Israeli television in 2010, and singled out for praise the performances of Dvir Benedek and Mali Levi; the skewering of mainstream Israelis' views of minorities such as Arabs, gays and the handicapped; and the dialogue, which the reviewers wrote accurately captured the cliches of Israeli society, corporate culture and internet culture.HaMisrad review, Odi Hirsch and Inav Schiff, Walla!, November 17, 2010 (in Hebrew) Reception was more mixed about the second season. Ami Friedman of Maariv wrote that the second season's situations were too unrealistic, and more worthy of an animated sitcom such as South Park, although he praised the acting and dialogue.HaMisrad review, Ami Friedman, Maariv, January 9, 2013 References External links * Category:The Office Category:Israeli television sitcoms Category:2010 Israeli television series debuts Category:2013 Israeli television series endings ","title":"HaMisrad"},{"id":"29553188","title":"Meghann Fahy"},{"id":"29553195","text":"Luis García (born 22 August 1934) is a Venezuelan fencer.

Their objective was to reach and enlighten the whole family, especially in the German middle classes, with a mixture of current events, essays on the natural sciences, biographical sketches, short stories, poetry, and full-page illustrations.Kirsten Belgum: \\"Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube\\" in: Women in German Yearbook 9 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) p. 93-100 At the height of its popularity Die Gartenlaube was widely read across the German speaking world. It could be found in all German states, the German colonies in Africa and among the significant German-speaking minorities of Latin America, such as Brazil.Todd Kontje (ed.): A Companion to German Realism, 1848-1900 (Rochster: Camden House, 2002) pp 12-13 Austrian composer Johann Strauss II even published a waltz dedicated to its readers, with the English title \\"Gartenlaube Waltz\\", in 1895.Norman Lloyd: The Golden Encyclopedia of Music (New York: Golden Press, a division of Western Publishing, 1968) During its 91-year history the journal changed owners several times. By the turn of the century it had become more focused on entertainment, and in the buildup to World War I it came under the control of right-wing nationalists. These changes corresponded to a decline in its readership. It was finally purchased outright by the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag in 1938, who renamed it Die neue Gartenlaube, and ceased publication in 1944. Despite this, today Die Gartenlaube remains important for comprehensive historical analysis in many fields and is regarded as an essential source for the understanding of German cultural history. Circulation and format Circulation of Die Gartenlaube increased steadily following its initial 1853 print run of 5,000 copies, reaching 60,000 by the end of its fourth year. After the magazine introduced serialized novels, its paid circulation increased dramatically, rising to 160,000 by 1863 and 382,000 by 1875. By comparison, most daily newspapers of the period had a circulation of only 4,000 copies. Since Die Gartenlaube became common family reading and many lending libraries and cafes took delivery, estimates of actual readership run between two and five million. It kept this market supremacy until at least 1887 and at one time it claimed to have the largest readership of any publication in the world.Michael Minden: Modern German Literature Cambridge, Polity Press, 2011 pp 67-68 The format of the magazine consisted of 52 weekly issues, 16-20 pages each, in quarto size (242mm x 305mm). The text, printed in a Fraktur (alt Deutsch) font, was typeset with elaborate engraved illustrations and, later, with some photographs. Die Gartenlaube's masthead depicted a grandfatherly figure reading aloud to a family around a table. Between 1853 and 1880 works by prominent German writers such as Goethe and Schiller dominated its pages. Goethe was featured 75 times in print and 14 times in illustrations, and Schiller was featured 90 times in print and 15 times in illustrations. Publication of works by novelist E. Marlitt in serial form, such as Goldelse beginning in 1866, had a significant impact on the magazine's popularity and on Marlitt's celebrity. A particularly famous image by Willy Stöwer of the sinking of the RMS Titanic was published by the magazine in 1912. Editorial stages Ernst Keil, founder of the magazine Volume 1 No. 1, 1853 Die Gartenlaube went through a number of distinct phases throughout its history. = Founding = The early volumes up to German unification in 1871 were envisioned to be a \\"people's encyclopedia\\", covering a wide range of interests. Founded by radical liberal publisher Ernst Keil, it was committed to the creation of a national democratic unity government and an enlightened population. The promotion of bourgeois values contrasted with the decline of aristocratic norms. During this period Die Gartenlaube was also noted for a neutral to positive view of Jews, with occasional articles on Jewish family life. In the years following the founding of the German Empire in 1871, Die Gartenlaube became increasingly antisemitic, publishing among other things Otto Glagau's violent attacks on \\"the Jews\\" from 1874 to 1876. The weekly was also seen as a defender of Prussian policy. Their dedicated and highly polemical interest in the culture war (proclaimed by Pope Pius IX in his \\"Dogma of Infallibility\\" in 1870), came to the defense of the liberal world view. Arguments in support of the National Liberal Party were supported in particular. When Ernst Keil died in 1878 the magazine had reached the height of its success and influence, with a paid circulation of 372,000. Its actual readership was at least 2 million, making it one of the most widely read publications in the world. = Kröner Verlag = In 1886, Keil's widow sold Die Gartenlaube to new publisher Adolf Kröner and his son Alfred. As co- owner/editors, under their guidance the paper changed dramatically in scope and content. Die Gartenlaube became increasingly conservative and political or religious issues were no longer covered. The topics of divorce and suicide were entirely taboo after this repositioning. Instead of a popular encyclopedia meant to enlighten and educate, by the turn of the century Die Gartenlaube was primarily an entertainment paper. = Scherl Verlag = In 1904, Die Gartenlaube was purchased by entrepreneur and right-wing nationalist August Scherl and the tone of the newspaper became increasingly political. In the run up to World War I, one article stated that the coming war was to be \\"the happy, great hour of struggle\\", not only because of German technological advances but because it would be \\"more beautiful and more magnificent to live forever on the plaque of heroes than to die a hollow death without name in a bed\\".Mark Hewitson: Germany and the Causes of the First World War (Oxford: Berg, 2004) p. 95 By buying up numerous other publishers, Scherl's company \\"Scherl-Verlag\\" had the largest circulation in Germany. However, his various costly business projects were not economically successful, so he sold the company to the \\"German Publishers Society\\" in 1914 and retired.Franz Menges: \\"Scherl, August\\" in Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB) 22 (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, 2005) pp. 698ff = Hugenberg and Eher Verlag = In 1916 the Scherl- Verlag publishing house was acquired by industrialist Alfred Hugenberg. During the interwar period, Hugenberg used his new media empire to help Adolf Hitler become Chancellor of Germany, hoping to use Hitler as a \\"tool\\". Hugenberg instead became increasingly isolated and had little influence in the Third Reich.Richard J. Evans The Coming of the Third Reich, (New York: Penguin Press, 2004) p. 314 These changes, as well as Die Gartenlaubes expressly antisemitic articles, resulted in readership declines. Attempts to stem the loss by merging it with similar weeklies had little effect. The largest part of Hugenberg's press group were finally purchased by the Nazi publishing house Eher-Verlag, where the journal was renamed Die neue Gartenlaube (\\"The New Garden Arbor\\") in 1938.

It is considered as one of the landmark books in the Odia literature.The Literary Heritage of SonepurFOLKLORE OF ORISSA  Synopsis of the book  The book is mainly based on the love between Ahimanikya the son of a Dewan and Sasisena a princess. It also depicts the tantric and shakti culture of Sonepur. It is said that Ahimanikya and Sasisena were in love in school and married secretly. After their marriage, they came to Sonepur which was also known as Kamitapura during that time. However, their marriage was rocked by a Tantric maiden named Jynanadei Maluni, (alias Madana Maluni). She was attracted by the beauty of Ahimanikya. One day while Ahimanikya was alone out in the market; Jynanadei Maluni induced him and brought him to her house. Then she transformed Ahimanikya into a lamb by virtue of her tantric power. It is said that during the nighttime she used to transform the lamb to Ahimanikya and romanced with him. However, during the daytime she used to transformed him to a lamb. Having lost her husband, a disappointed Sasisena searched Ahimanikya in every corner of the Sonepur kingdom. After some time she got an appointment with the king of Sonepur and was selected to become a soldier in the Sonepur royal army. She was very successful and earned name and fame after she killed a man-eater tiger. The king of Sonepur was so impressed that he desired to give his daughter in marriage to Sasisena. As Sasisena could not reveal her actual identity she was forced to marry the Sonepur's princess. Nonetheless, after marriage she revealed her story to the princess of Sonepur kingdom. The princess was moved by her pathetic situation and offered all possible help to Sasisena. They searched all places in Sonepur. It was described that then they planned cleverly and build a big tank with four temples on the four corners. A festival was organized for the dedication of the tank and all people of Sonepur were invited for it. Jynanadei Maluni came with Ahimanikya to enjoy the festival. Ahimanikya could recognize Sasisena and informed her secretly by writing on the wall of the temple that she is under the captive of Jynanadei Maluni. A cleaver Sasisena informed the king of Sonepur that she wanted to sacrifice some lambs before Goddess Bhagawati and requested the king to bring the lamb of Jynanadei Maluni. Jynanadei Maluni brought her lamb and the lamb was no other than Ahimanikya. By the order of his highness, the king of Sonepur, Jynanadei Maluni transformed him to the human form. It was said that at the desire of Sonepur Raja both the princess of Sonepur and Sasisena became the wives of Ahimanikya. This story is still alive in the memory of people of Subarnapur district. As an evidence to this tantric episode the Sasisena Temple is located in the Sonepur town.

Born in Swansea Reynolds was notable for becoming the Welsh lightweight champion in 1937. Boxing career Reynolds' first recorded professional bout is listed against Len Wickwar, a far more experienced fighter from Leicester. The match took place 20 October 1930 at Stourbridge, and although Reynolds was Welsh born, he was now boxing out of Wolverhampton in England, and rarely fought in his home country. Wickwar won on a points decision after the contest went the distance. Reynolds would face Wickwar at least six times throughout his professional career, losing all the encounters, five on points. Reynolds first recorded pro win was over Norman Snow, beating him on 2 November 1930 and then again three weeks later. On his journey to becoming Welsh lightweight champion Reynolds faced several notable boxers, losing to Welsh Champion Phineas John, losing twice and winning once against British Lightweight Champion George Daly and a points win over Northern-area champion Jimmy Stewart. On 11 November 1937, Reynolds faced Boyo Rees in a challenge for the Welsh lightweight title. The bout, held in Reynolds' hometown of Swansea, was scheduled for fifteen rounds, but was stopped in the tenth when Rees was forced to retire with a cut eye.Boxer:George Reynolds BoxRec.com Between gaining the title and his first title defence Reynolds took in five fights, winning only once. He beat a fairly inexperienced Hal Cartwright, but then lost three straight bouts against Dave Crowley, Lefty Satan Flynn and Jimmy Walsh. This losing streak was only halted by a draw with London journeyman Tommy Hyams. His first title defence for the Welsh belt was against Glen Evans at Briton Ferry on 9 November 1937; the fight ended in the ninth with Reynolds winning by knockout. He then lost to future British Lightweight champion Eric Boon before beating Northern-area title holder Jack Carrick. Reynolds followed his victory over Carrick with a second Welsh title defence, this time a re-match with Boyo Rees. The match, held at the Pavilion in Mountain Ash on 4 April 1938, went the distance of fifteen rounds, with Reynolds losing the Championship title on points. Reynolds made one more title attempt, this time for the Welsh welterweight title, failing in his bid against Taffy Williams.

Early hopes for the new town were disappointed in 1877 when a promised railway extension bypassed the town. In 1886, Yatina's population was 80, with an estimate of 100 residents the next year. Boundaries for the locality were created on 16 December 1999 which includes the site of the Government Town of Yatina. The portion within the Northern Areas Council,being the southern side of locality, was added on 12 April 2001. Part of Yatina on its western side was 'excluded' and added to the adjoining locality of Tarcowie on 2 August 2012 following a request from residents. The name derives from the Aboriginal name of a nearby black rock. Land use within the locality is ’primary production’ and is concerned with “agricultural production and the grazing of stock on relatively large holdings.” The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Yatina had a population of 29. Yatina is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, and the local government areas of the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton and the Northern Areas Council.

It is made in the form of a short biographical account of the life of the medieval Tuscan condottiere, Castruccio Castracani, who lived in and ruled Lucca. A view of Serravalle Pistoiese, which is set upon a hill with some sides being quite steep. Machiavelli describes an attack by the Luccan forces of Castracani on the ridge of this town, that successfully caught Florentine forces by surprise. The book is thought to have been written during a visit to Lucca in 1520. It was dedicated to Zanobi Buondelmonti and Luigi Alamanni. The former was also one of the two men to whom the Discourses on Livy was dedicated. Both, along with Machiavelli, are considered members of the so-called Orti Oricellari group. Despite being in the form of a biography the sayings of Castracani are generally considered to have been fabricated by Machiavelli. It is therefore sometimes compared to his more well-known works including The Prince, the Discourses on Livy, and the Art of War. A distinct section of sayings appears at the end of the work, after Castracani's life has ended. Leo Strauss, in 1958, analyzed the various speeches attributed to Castracani in this work and found that they had mostly come from classical Roman and Greek sources, including most significantly several that had been attributed to Democritus by Diogenes Laërtius. Machiavelli treats Castracani as a person whose aim was to unite Tuscany, but who failed because, as Machiavelli has the dying Castracani tell his heir \\"Fortune, who is admitted to be arbiter of all human things, did not give me so much judgement that I could early understand her, nor so much time that I could overcome her\\". This proposal that leaders can overcome the arbiter of all things is a common theme in Machiavelli's better known political works such as The Prince. By treating Castracani as a founder, almost, of a new state, Machiavelli used him as an example of the most important type of prince according to his other writings. In fact Machiavelli opens with a passage that treats prophets as the highest type of secular prince. Castracani was found as a baby left in a field, Machiavelli reports. Machiavelli ends by touching upon another theme found in his other works, which is that Italy in his time was weak. References *.

Connell (November 2, 1871 – October 22, 1955, Philadelphia) was a U.S. Republican politician. He was a member of the Philadelphia City Council from 1913 to 1939 and was acting Mayor of Philadelphia in 1939. Biography Connell was born on November 2 1939 in the Cobbs Creek section of Philadelphia. His father was Horatio P. Connell, who had served as Sheriff of Philadelphia. His grandfather, George Connell was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate whose accomplishments including pushing legislation for the creation of Fairmount Park and Mount Moriah Cemetery. A member of the Republican, he became active in Philadelphia politics and served as the Republican chair for the 40th ward in West Philadelphia. He became a member of the Philadelphia City Council in 1913, first as a member of the Common Council and then the Select Council after 1915. In January 1936, he became the city council president. On August 11, 1939, mayor Samuel Davis Wilson, who had been seriously ill, retired as mayor in hopes that he would better recover without the stress of his position. As the city council president, Connell was sworn in as acting mayor that day. Having taken over, he immediately ordered 210 police officers from administrative work to patrol duties because of a shortage of patrol officers in the city. For much of his of his term, Connell grappled with the city's budget during the Great Depression. He addressed the council on the need to identify $9 million in revenue to avoid cutting city services. He obtained a $41 million loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in September 1939 that would be backed by revenues of the city's natural gas plant as an initial step. He proposed the installation of up to 8,000 parking meters across the city in another bid to add revenue. In December 1939, shortly before his term expired, Connell and the city council, with a vote of 17 to 3 in favor, approved a wage tax of 1.5% on earned incomes from both city residents and commuters. A worker at the Philadelphia Navy Yard sued the city, alleging that the tax was unconstitutional. In 1943, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the case of Kiker v. Philadelphia ruled that the wage tax was indeed constitutional and upheld it. The tax remains in place as of 2020 and is Philadelphia's largest source of tax revenue. Although recognized by the city as a Mayor of Philadelphia, Connell was often referred to as the acting mayor in media reports. The City Charter at the time called for the election of a replacement of the mayor by a vote of the Council, with the council president holding office until that election. While the council intended to vote in Connell's favor, an obscure provision in the charter stated that a member of council would not be eligible to hold another office \\"during the term for which he shall have been elected as Councilman.\\" Upon discovery, some members of the council interpreted this to mean that Connell could not formally be elected as Mayor. The council’s options were to ignore the portion of the charter requiring the council to elect a mayor or to elect Connell and allow the issue to be resolved in the courts. Regardless of the decisions around seating Connell as mayor, he served out the remainder of Wilson's term until Robert Lamberton's inauguration on January 1, 1940. After Connell left office, Mayor Lamberton appointed him as Director of Public Welfare. Connell died on October 22, 1955 after a stroke and is interred at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia. He was survived by his wife Carolina (Fairman) Connell, his son George Fairman Connell and a daughter.

Boyagoda is also a member of the University of Toronto's English Department as served as the President of PEN Canada from 2015-2017.  Biography  Born in Oshawa, Ontario, in 1976 to Sri Lankan-Catholic parents, Boyagoda earned his Bachelor of Arts in English at the University of Toronto (1999), and received his Masters (2001) and PhD (2004) in English from Boston University. In 2005, Boyagoda was a postdoctoral fellow with an institute for advanced studies at the University of Notre Dame, where he was concurrent Assistant Professor of English. In 2006, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor of American Studies in the English Department at Ryerson University. That same year, he published his first novel, Governor of the Northern Province. Boyagoda received early tenure in 2009, following the publication of his book Race, Immigration, and American Identity in the Fiction of Salman Rushdie, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner. During his time at Ryerson, Boyagoda held a series of administrative positions at Ryerson University, including Chair of the English Department and the founding Director of Zone Learning, a university-wide experiential learning program. In 2011, Boyagoda published his second novel, Beggar’s Feast, followed by a biography of Fr. Richard John Neuhaus in 2015. From 2015 to 2017, Boyagoda served as the President of PEN Canada. In 2016, Boyagoda became the Principal and Vice President of the University of St. Michael's College and was appointed to the Basilian Chair in Christianity Arts and Letters. He is also became a faculty member of the University of Toronto's English department. As a professor, Boyagoda teaches courses on the politics of the American novel and literary non-fiction, he also teaches the Gilson Seminar in Faith and Ideas, a course for students in their first-year of university studies at the University of Toronto. Boyagoda’s third novel, Original Prin, was published in 2018. Boyagoda is now researching the relationship between transnationalism and nationalism in the creation of the \\"Great American Novel,” in addition to working on a sequel to Original Prin, titled Dante’s Indiana. Boyagoda is the jury chair for the 2019 Scotiabank Giller Prize. Boyagoda lives in Toronto’s East End with his wife and four daughters.  Work  Boyagoda's first novel, Governor of the Northern Province, was nominated for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and published to national acclaim. The deeply satirical novel told the tale of Sam Bokarie, an ex–African warlord who moves to small-town Canada to capitalize on its zealous hospitality. Books in Canada commented, \\"In his take-no-prisoners novel about politics, immigration, and rock-solid Canadian naiveté, Randy Boyagoda emerges as the Evelyn Waugh of the North.\\"\\"First Novels\\" It was described by the National Post as an \\"auspicious debut.\\"\\"A Feast of Words\\" National Post His second book, a monograph based on his doctoral dissertation, was published in 2008. In this book, he argues that the work of Salman Rushdie, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner reveals a century- long transformation of how American identity and experience have been imagined, and that these transformations have been provoked by new forms of immigration and by unanticipated mixings of cultures and ethnic groups. His scholarly work (on such authors as Herman Melville, Don DeLillo, and Flannery O'Connor) has also appeared in journals including the Southern Literary Journal, Studies in American Culture, and South Asian Review. Boyagoda's second novel, Beggar's Feast, has been published around the world to critical acclaim, by Penguin Canada in 2011, Perera-Hussain (Sri Lanka) and Penguin US in 2012, Harper-Collins India in 2013, and Penguin UK in 2014. Told in four parts, the novel traces the story of Sam Kandy, who is born to low prospects in a Ceylon village in 1899 and dies a hundred years later as the wealthy headman of the same village—a self-made shipping magnate and the father of 16 who's been married three times and widowed twice.\\"The Apprenticeship of Randy Boyagoda\\" National Post 10 May 2011 Praised by The Globe and Mail as \\"a post- colonial Gatsby\\",Mark Jarman, \\"A Postcolonial Gatsby\\" The Globe and Mail 22 April 2011 Sam Kandy is the center of a novel about family, pride, and ambition.

In 2015, Boyagoda published a biography of Richard John Neuhaus, a project supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Neuhaus (1936-2009) was the prolific and influential Catholic priest and New York intellectual whose lifelong effort was to argue for the place of religion in American public life, something he did as a radical Leftist and Lutheran minister and as a neoconservative Catholic priest. Boyagoda's biography, entitled Richard John Neuhaus: A Life in the Public Square, has met with wide critical attention, with notable reviews running in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Globe and Mail. Boyagoda’s third novel, Original Prin, was published by Biblioasis in Canada in 2018 and in the United States in 2019. The novel, the first of a projected trilogy, tells the story of Prin, a forty-year-old professor at a Catholic college in downtown Toronto. After surviving cancer, Prin commits to becoming a better husband and father. His pursuit of this goal is interrupted by the imminent shutdown of his college and the arrival of Prin’s ex-girlfriend from graduate school, Wende, who is now working as a consultant to the college. Divinely inspired, Prin agrees to travel to the Middle East with Wende to launch an academic partnership that has deadly consequences. The Toronto Star called the novel “fresh and utterly original.” The sequel, Dante’s Indiana, is expected to be published in 2021. As a literary and cultural commentator, Boyagoda is a frequent contributor to magazines and newspapers including the Financial Times, Chronicle of Higher Education, the Paris Review, Harper's Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, First Things, the Walrus, the New York Times, the National Post, and The Globe and Mail, the New Statesman and The Guardian. His criticism includes reviews of Enid Blyton, Haruki Murakami, Orhan Pamuk, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Jose Saramago, among others.

History The French expedition under Captain Jules Dumont d'Urville landed on Débarquement Rock in the Dumoulin Islands on 22 January 1840. Because rock samples were obtained, they gave the name \\"Pointe Géologie\\" to a coastal feature charted as lying south of Débarquement Rock. The archipelago was delineated, in part, from aerial photographs taken by the U.S. Navy's Operation Highjump in 1946–47. Following surveys by French Antarctic Expedition parties during the 1950–52 period, the French gave the name \\"Archipel de Pointe Géologie\\" to the entire archipelago, as d'Urville's coastal feature is believed to correlate with portions of the cluster of islands close to the north of Astrolabe Glacier Tongue. In 1952, a small base was built on Île des Pétrels (Petrel Island) to study a nearby colony of emperor penguins. This base was called Base Marret. As the main base, Port Martin, was destroyed by fire on the night of 23 January 1952, Base Marret was chosen as the overwintering site for 1952–53. The new main base, Dumont d'Urville Station, was built on the same island, located west of Port Martin, and opened on 12 January 1956, to serve as a centre for French scientific research during the Antarctic International Geophysical Year 1957–58. The station has remained in active use ever since. Antarctic Specially Protected Area A site cluster in the heart of the Géologie Archipelago, south and east, and in the immediate vicinity, of Petrel Island, comprises Jean Rostand, Le Mauguen, Claude Bernard and Lamarck Islands, Bon Docteur Nunatak, and a breeding site of emperor penguins on the intervening sea ice. The site is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.120. It was designated as such because it contains representative examples of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems. Apart from the emperor penguin colony, the only one of about 30 in Antarctica that lies close to a permanent research station, birds nesting in the area include Adélie penguins, Antarctic skuas, Wilson's storm petrels southern giant petrels, snow petrels and Cape petrels. Weddell seals also occur there.

Historic site The rock shelter known as Granite House was built in 1911, for use as a field kitchen, by Griffith Taylor’s second geological excursion in the course of the Terra Nova expedition. It was enclosed on three sides with granite boulder walls and used a sled to support a sealskin roof. The stone walls of the shelter have partly collapsed. It contains the corroded remains of tins, a sealskin and some cord. The sled lies 50 m seaward of the shelter and consists of a few scattered pieces of wood, straps and buckles. The site has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 67), following a proposal by New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Operational history  SKG 210 had its origins in Erprobungsgruppe 210 (Test Wing 210), formed at Köln-Ostheim airfield under the command of Hptm. Walter Rubensdörffer in July 1940 as the official service test unit for the then-new Messerschmitt Me 210, the intended successor to the earlier Messerschmitt Bf 110. However, such were the delays in that aircraft’s development that the unit was utilised to develop tactical and strategic practices required to operate the in-service Bf 110s in newer, fighter-bomber and ground-attack roles they were being adapted to. By the time the unit was re-designated I. Gruppe, Schnellkampfgeschwader 210 in April 1941 the unit was based at Abbeville, bombing Allied shipping and land-based targets. The unit then moved east to prepare for the attack on Soviet Russia as part of 2nd Air Corps and originally based at Radzyn. II/SKG 210 was formed from III/ZG 76. Some 50 serviceable Bf 110s took part in Operation Barbarossa from two units; Zerstörergeschwader 26 and Schnellkampfgeschwader 210. The Bf 110 provided support to the German Army, carrying out strike missions in the face of heavy AA and ground defences. In the opening air strikes, on 22 June, SKG 210 claimed 344 Soviet aircraft destroyed, more than any other unit, for the loss of 7 Bf 110s destroyed and damaged.Bergström 2007, p. 19. SKG 210 flew over the Central part of the front supporting the German army's encirclement and overrunning of Russian land forces in the Białystok and Minsk areas in the early phase of the campaign, and flew in support of the advancing Army Group Centre advance to Moscow in 1941. Between 22 June 1941 and 26 July 1941 the unit claimed to have destroyed 823 Soviet aircraft on the ground and 92 in the air, 2,136 vehicles and 165 tanks destroyed for 57 Bf 110s lost to enemy action.Bergström 2007, p. 50.

It is so named because it was the van which carried the body of Edith Cavell when it was repatriated to the United Kingdom following the end of the First World War. The van also carried the bodies of Charles Fryatt and The Unknown Warrior. It served with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, the Southern Railway and British Railways before entering into preservation at the Kent and East Sussex Railway. The van was fully restored in 2010. History The Cavell Van was designed by Richard Maunsell. It was built to Diagram 960 by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway at Ashford Works in 1919 and was the prototype Parcels and Miscellaneous Van. In 1919, it was used for the carriage of the bodies of two people killed during the First World War – Edith Cavell and Charles Fryatt. It carried the body of The Unknown Warrior in 1920. =Edith Cavell= Plaque carried on the van Edith Cavell was born in Swardeston, Norfolk in 1865. She trained as a nurse in 1907 and worked at various hospitals in Belgium. During 1914–15, she helped over 200 allied POWs escape before being arrested and subsequently executed. Her body was repatriated from Belgium in May 1919, and was transported in the Cavell Van from Dover to London. =Charles Fryatt= Charles Fryatt was born in Southampton, Hampshire in 1872.

His body was carried from Dover to London on board the Cavell Van on 10 November 1920, prior to the funeral service at Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920. =Service history= Interior Cavell Van, Bodiam The van was numbered 132 by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. It passed to the Southern Railway in 1923 and was renumbered 1972, then 374S on transfer to departmental service in August 1946. The van was used as a stores van serving Lancing Carriage Works and Brighton Works. Under British Railways it was numbered DS734. It was transferred to the internal user pool in October 1967 and renumbered 082757. The van ended its service at Guildford cable depot. The van was withdrawn from service in 1991 and stored at Hoo Junction. It was sold to the Tenterden Rolling Stock Group in 1992 and moved to the Kent and East Sussex Railway. It was delivered to on 22 January 1992. The van is numbered 93 on the Kent and East Sussex Railway stocklist. In 1994, the van was moved to the Rother Valley Railway at . During its stay at the Rother Valley Railway, the van was sold and its condition deteriorated. It was sold again in 2003 and returned to the Kent and East Sussex Railway in 2004. In December 2009, an appeal was opened to raise £35,000 to fully restore the van, with the intention of completion by 10 November 2010, the 90th anniversary of the carriage of the body of The Unknown Warrior. The fully restored van was unveiled on 10 November 2010, and will now be used as a museum to commemorate The Unknown Warrior, Cavell and Fryatt. The exhibition mounted inside the van was put together by pupils from Homewood School, Tenterden, in a joint project between the school and the railway. The pupils carried out research at the Imperial War Museum, London, where they were allowed access to letters written by Cavell. The project was entered in a competition organised by the British Interactive Media Association. Homewood School were declared the winners of the competition on 8 July 2010. The van's historical importance is assessed as \\"very important\\" by the Vintage Carriages Trust. In October 2015, the van was transported by road to Norwich, Norfolk as part of the commemorations for the 100th anniversary of Edith Cavell's death. The van was on display outside The Forum until 17 October.

The peak is visible from Calgary, weather permitting. Mount Glasgow's nearest higher peak is Mount Cornwall, to the southwest. History Peter Fidler, the first non-native to visit southern Alberta, took bearings on this identifiable peak as he traveled south across the prairies near present-day Calgary. He wrote of it: \\"a remarkable high cliff, very much resembling a pyramid - from which very near resemblance I shall call it by that name.\\" This is the first known instance of a non-native naming a peak in the Canadian Rockies. However, the Pyramid name did not stick, and Mount Glasgow was named in 1922 for , a British warship involved in the Battle of the Falkland Islands during the First World War in the South Atlantic. The mountain's name became official in 1939 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1949 by Arnold Choquette. Geology Mount Glasgow is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Glasgow is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below with wind chill factors below . Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Elbow River which is a tributary of the Bow River.
