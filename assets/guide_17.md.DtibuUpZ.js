The population is unknown and may have gone locally extinct in some areas due to hunting; it is listed as vulnerable in Argentina. Behaviour Despite being active during the day, Azara's agoutis are quite difficult to study, as they are naturally extremely shy and will flee and hide when humans approach. Their shyness may be related to their solitary lifestyles, but may be because they are heavily preyed upon by many carnivorous species, including humans. However, if bred in captivity, they can become trusting animals. Azara's agoutis will let out little barks when alarmed. These animals are sometimes known as \\"jungle gardeners\\", as they often bury nuts and seeds and forget where they put them, therefore helping new plants to grow. References *John F.

Dogmeat was introduced as an optional companion to the player character in the original Fallout (1997), and has made cameo appearances in the sequel Fallout 2 (1998) and in some other video games. Other, different Dogmeats are featured in the same role in Fallout 3 (2008) and Fallout 4 (2015). All incarnations of the character were well received, becoming widely regarded as one of the best remembered features in the series, as well as one of the most popular sidekick type characters in video gaming overall. Appearances In the original Fallout by Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the protagonist player character, the Vault Dweller, first encounters the feral Dogmeat in Junktown. Dogmeat's former owner (an unnamed man closely resembling Max Rockatansky) died at the hands of thugs hired by a local gangster named Gizmo. If the player character feeds Dogmeat or is wearing a leather jacket, Dogmeat will follow them and fight in their defense. According to the series' canon, Dogmeat was adopted by the Vault Dweller on 30 December 2161, and killed by a force field barrier during the Vault Dweller's assault on the Master's Military Base on 20 April 2162. Dogmeat was supposed to appear in the canceled film adaptation of the game as well.Matt Bertz, Codec Chatter: Assassin's Creed Scribe Corey May, Game Informer, 1 October 2009. In Fallout 2, Dogmeat makes a non-canonical appearance in an Easter egg type special encounter \\"Café of Broken Dreams\\". During the encounter, Dogmeat can be picked up by the player character, the Chosen One, if the player approaches him wearing Vault 13 jumpsuit (or the Bridgekeeper's robes, due to a bug in the game). If the player chooses to kill Dogmeat, a man named Mel (in a reference to Mel Gibson, the actor who played Mad Max in the film) will appear and try to avenge him. Dogmeat has made uncredited cameo appearances outside of the Fallout universe in Troika Games' 2001 Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura (created by Fallout designer Tim Cain) and in 2004 The Bard's Tale by inXile Entertainment (headed by Fallout producer Brian Fargo). However, there were no plans to bring back Dogmeat for the original third Fallout game project by Black Isle Studios, the canceled Van Buren. An entirely different dog named Dogmeat appears in Fallout 3 by Bethesda Softworks, which begins in the year 2277. His master, a scavenger, was killed by a band of raiders in the scrapyard where the dog is to be found. Dogmeat can be recruited by Fallout 3s player character, the Lone Wanderer. The dog can find objects of value across the landscape and bring them to the player.Chris Hicks, Three Fallout 3 screens – including Dog Meat  Faithful friend returns in sequel, GamesRadar, 21 April 2008. Fallout 3 expansion set Broken Steel optionally (enabled by choosing the 'perk' bonus \\"Puppies!\\" after reaching 22nd experience level) allows a killed Dogmeat to be replaced by a new one (with twice as many hit points, that is a starting value of 1,000 instead of 500) whenever he dies during the game.Karen Schrier, David Gibso, Designing Games for Ethics: Models, Techniques and Frameworks, page 33.

In this game Dogmeat is a German Shepherd, and cannot die. Character design Blue Heeler breed (pictured) to resemble the dog of Mad Max from the film Mad Max 2 Dogmeat was inspired by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been \\"Dogshit\\" and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood \\"Dogmeat\\". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, \\"Leonard Boyarsky, the [game's] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game would be really cool. [It's] why we wanted a dog in the first place.\\" Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably \\"one person to thank for Dogmeat.\\" Heinig himself said: \\"My understanding is that [Fallout designer] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question.\\" In 2009, Fallout designer Chris Taylor said they \\"never expected that Dogmeat would become such a popular character.\\" Taylor said: \\"I always intended that the various NPCs that joined up with the player would come to a violent end. I was shocked when I heard of all the work people went through to keep Dogmeat alive to the end – especially the hell that they went through with the force fields in the Military Base.\\" According to Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas designer Chris Avellone, Dogmeat is \\"arguably the most successful NPC companion ever\\" for several reasons: \\"One, he doesn't talk, so the players can project a personality on to him. Two, he's effective in combat ... and three, he's a dog that stays with you through thick-and-thin.

He was the great grandson of Amlaibh, the grandson of Mormaer Ailín II through the male line. He was the chief of a kin-group tracing its origins to the settlement which followed the death of Ailín II, where the ten brothers of Mormaer Maol Domhnaich were compensated with lands. Baltar and his kin achieved the Mormaerdom because he was allowed to marry the daughter of Mormaer Domhnall, Margaret. When Domhnall died in 1365, Margaret succeeded with Baltar as de facto ruler. It had been Domhnall's intention that the marriage would eventually allow the succession of a grandson, but it seems that Baltar was intended to rule in his turn. Indeed, Baltar and Margaret had a son, Donnchad, who was probably a young man by the time Baltar and Margaret succeeded. We do not know how relations deteriorated, but it seems that Donnchadh got impatient. In the summer of 1384, King Robert II issued two charters formally conferring the Mormaerdom on Baltar. However, a year later he and his wife Margaret resigned the Mormaerdom over to their eldest son Donnchadh. Brown (p. 215) attributes this change as a policy change of the monarchy triggered by the increased influence of John of Carrick, the future king Robert III. However, in 1388, Baltar and Margaret were handed custody of the Mormaerdom for the remainder of their lives, with Donnchadh retaining the title. Donnchadh was confined to a stronghold in Loch Lomond, Inchmurrin castle. See also *Faslane Castle, Shandon Castle, and St Michael's Chapel, Faslane was once the seat of Walter de Faslane.

Haenschen, was an American bandleader, composer, and radio musician.  Name origin  The Carl Fenton Orchestra (AKA \\"Carl Fenton’s Orchestra\\") was a title given to Brunswick Records studio bands through the 1920s. The name was invented by Brunswick music director Walter Gustave \\"Gus\\" Haenschen shortly after taking the position for their brand-new American division. Later, the name was taken by violinist Rudy Greenberg. Haenschen, whose own name was considered ill-suited for commercial recordings, haphazardly chose the name \\"Fenton\\" after the town of Fenton, Missouri, near his hometown of St Louis, Missouri. He attended Washington University. (He told an interviewer \\"How do you find a name? Just pull it out of a hat.\\" The first name \\"Carl\\" was likely selected by Brunswick's office staff.  Early recordings  The earliest songs recorded by Carl Fenton's Orchestra were Karavan and Romance, from October 1919. Brunswick Records released many \\"Carl Fenton\\" records, with various line-ups of musicians. The band was typically led by Haenschen in the studio, but was led by studio musician/conductor Reuben \\"Rudy\\" Greenberg during their occasional concerts.  Orchestra change  Around the time that Haenschen left Brunswick Records in mid-1927, Greenberg purchased the rights to the Carl Fenton name. From 1928-1930 Greenberg was musical director for Gennett Records, where he recorded as \\"Carl Fenton’s New Yorkers\\". Under the direction of Greenberg, the Carl Fenton Orchestra then moved to radio, where they co- starred with a young Bing Crosby from 1931-1932 on the CBS network (on tour the orchestra was named \\"Cremo Orchestra\\" after sponsor Cremo Cigars). In 1932, Greenberg had his name legally changed to Carl Fenton. He continued to work as a music director for radio and theaters till his death in January, 1942.

It lies between Kimmage, Tallaght, Templeogue, Terenure and Walkinstown, and includes the residential developments of Greenhills Estate, Greenpark, Limekiln Estate and Temple Manor. Greenhills is in the Dublin 12 postal area. Name and history The area's name comes from the sand-based hills that made up a glacial esker which formed in the area at the end of the Ice Age. Greenhills may have housed settlements since at least the Bronze Age, as an urn dating from that time was found in the area in the late 1890s. Discovered in a former quarry between the Greenhills Road and St. Columba's Road, this urn is now held by the National Museum of Ireland. However, the area was mostly farmland until expansion in the 1950s and 1960s, when new housing estates were built. Facilities Tymon Park is situated in the old townland of Greenhills and is located to the south of the Limekiln estate. It is administered by South Dublin County Council. The River Poddle and connected artificial ponds are features within the park. The M50 motorway splits the Greenhills side of the park from Kilnamanagh and the Tymon North estate (both in Tallaght). A smaller park, Greenhills Park, is also administered by the South Dublin County Council and is used for association football. The Church of the Holy Spirit is the local Roman Catholic church. It has a verdigris copper roof. The church stands beside a community centre, which has function rooms, and advice, adult education and other services. Local primary schools include Holy Spirit Junior and Senior Schools which were formed in September 2015 following the amalgamation of St. Paul's Junior and Senior Girl's National Schools, and St. Peter's Boy's National School. Riverview Educate Together National School opened on Limekiln Road in 2016. Secondary schools include St. Paul's Secondary (girls) and Greenhills College VEC (boys). Greenhills College also provides Post Leaving Certificate and adult education courses. The local scout group is the 65th Greenhills. Communications Walkinstown Roundabout The Walkinstown Roundabout, or Walkinstown Cross, is a junction which serves seven local roads - the Greenhills Road into Tallaght, Ballymount Road towards Ballymount and the M50, Walkinstown Avenue towards Ballyfermot, Walkinstown Road towards Drimnagh, Cromwellsfort Road towards Kimmage and Crumlin, Bunting Road towards Crumlin and St. Peter's Road towards Greenhills and Templeogue.

For the 2005 International Cup, the side wore the colours in a vertical pattern (similar to the St Kilda Football Club in the Australian Football League) with the official Samurais' logo featuring a caricature of a samurai warrior. In 2006, the design featured a predominantly black stripe with white stars and red trim. For the 2008 International Cup, the team reverted to a predominantly white strip with a red sash. History The Samurais' first international opposition was in 1995 when the team competed in the Arafura Games. They have since competed in the games in 1997, 1999 and 2001. In 2001, Troy Beard became coach of the Samurais. Japan's Samurais competed in the inaugural Australian Football International Cup in 2002 finishing in 10th place. The year 2004 saw a vastly improved Samurai touring Australia and Singapore, playing six matches and winning four. One of these games was again against New Zealand, but this time an Auckland club rather than the national team, which Japan lost by just two points. In 2005, the Samurai took home the Silver medal in the Arafura Games. Later that year, the team again competed in the International Cup, lifting its international ranking to 9th and included its first International Cup win, by 71 points against Spain. Richard Laidler, who had been Troy Beard's assistant for four years previously took on the senior coaching position in 2006 and the Samurai again toured Australia with a young squad playing 4 games finishing with a 2-point win against Box Hill North Football Club, but losses to the Howlong Football Club, Box Hill North Superules and Melbourne Vietnam Australian Football Club. In 2007, the Samurai toured Australia, finishing 6–9 (45) in its game against the newly formed Melbourne based Vietnamese side, the Elgar Park Dragons 13–7 (85).Vietnamese overcome determined Samurais outfit from worldfootynews.com Against Box Hill they registered a 30-point win. In the lead-up to the 2008 International Cup, Japan once again competed against its sister club Box Hill, this time easily accounting for its Australian rivals, winning by 56 points. This increased expectations for the Japanese side. During the cup, they had a breakthrough win against Samoa, following it with a thrashing of India which helped them to climb to 8th in the overall tournament ranking. Notable players Michito Sakaki, current captain of the Samurai, has trained with the Essendon Football Club and played semi- professionally in Australia has been All-International in both 2005 and 2008. Teammate Tsuyoshi Kase also trained with Essendon and has played amateur football in Australia.

Background Commodore Matthew C. Perry, commander of the U.S. Home Squadron had recently captured the port cities of Tuxpan and Carmen.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846–1848, New York:Macmillan, He next decided to move against the city of San Juan Bautista (present day Villahermosa), the capital of the state of Tabasco. Perry had received reports in April that the Mexican commander in Tabasco, Col. Domingo Echagaray, had strengthened the city's defenses and built obstructions in the Tabasco River (present day Grijalva River). Perry assembled the Mosquito Fleet, consisting of the steamboats Scourge, Scorpion, Spitfire, and Vixen, plus the brigs Washington, Stromboli, and Vesuvius, and the merchant schooner Spitfire, off Frontera on 14 June and began moving upstream, towing 40 ship's boats carrying 1,050 men and seven surfboats with a field piece each. Battle At 4:15 PM, near Santa Teresa, 12 miles (19 km) below San Juan Bautista, the fleet ran through an ambush with little difficulty. At 5:45 PM, at an \\"s\\" curve in the river known as the \\"Devil's Bend\\", Perry encountered Mexican fire from the chaparral, dispersed some cavalry with the Vesuvius, and anchored for the night intending to deal with the obstructions ahead during daylight the next day. At dusk, a lone Mexican shot one of Perry's men on the Vesuvius's forecastle. On 16 June, while investigating the obstructions, one of Perry's lieutenants, William May, was wounded, and Perry decided to lead ashore 1,173 men and ten pieces of artillery. They quickly took Acachapan, when Col. Claro Hidalgo's 600 men fled, abandoning their uneaten breakfasts. In the meantime Lieutenant David D. Porter, on board the Spitfire, managed to remove the piles obstructing the river and move the steamers past by 10 AM. At one point just as Perry was approaching the Mexican defenses, Porter opened fire on them mistaking the Americans for the Mexicans. The mistake was quickly remedied, and Porter kept on moving upriver, soon reaching Fort Iturbide guarding the city from the riverbank. Two ships, Scorpion and Spitfire, ran past the fort and began shelling it from the rear. Porter led 68 men ashore, seized the fort, and raised the American flag. The steamers continued on to capture the town, raising the US flag over the governor's house by 11:50 AM. Perry and the landing force arrived at 3:30 PM. Aftermath The last Mexican port on the Gulf coast had been captured. Colonel Echagaray withdrew further upstream to Tamulte with 111 soldiers and 115 civilians, but guerrilla bands lingered behind. Perry left a garrison in Tabasco, under the command of Commander Gershom J. Van Brunt, but yellow fever and the constant presence of guerrillas persuaded Perry to withdraw the garrison on 22 July, but maintained the blockade at Frontera, periodically patrolling the river. In the aftermath of the U.S. victory, a movement in the states of Tabasco and Chiapas arose which sought to break the two states from Mexico and join with Guatemala, but Perry withheld support, and the movement eventually died off.

The Northern Front was created on June 24, 1941 from the Leningrad Military District. Its primary goal was the defense of the Kola Peninsula and the northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. On August 23, 1941, the Front's forces were divided into the Karelian Front and the Leningrad Front. Lieutenant General Markian M. Popov commanded the Front for the three months of its existence. The Front's major force structure was based on the 7th Army, 14th Army, 23rd Armies and the Leningrad People's Opolcheniye Army. Other forces included four Rifle Corps, two Mechanized Corps, seventeen Rifle Divisions, four Tank Divisions, two Motor Rifle Divisions, eight artillery regiments of the Reserve of Highest Command, eight Aviation Divisions (including one objective air division), seven Fortified Regions, one Fortified Position, and thirteen machinegun battalions.

History The KBW consisted of 10 new cavalry regiments, an infantry division and two buffer brigades. The corps itself was subordinate to the Ministry of Public Security. By the end of August 1945, its force was made up of 29,053 soldiers and 2,356 officers. The KBW was called forth to protect key public infrastructure such as railways, but mainly to combat and suppress the anti-communist resistance in Poland including activities of the Cursed soldiers as well as all organizations which continued their armed struggle against the Communist takeover; such as the Freedom and Independence (WiN), the National Armed Forces (NSZ), and the remnants of the Polish Home Army (AK) among others. Original postwar Garrison of the Internal Security Corps in Szczecin, Poland Between 1945 and 1954, the KBW fell under the responsibility of Minister Jakub Berman of the Politburo, who was in charge of the Ministry of Public Security. Later, it was part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Between March 1945 and April 1947 alone, units of the KBW killed over 1,500 members of the Democratic Underground known as the Cursed soldiers, wounded 301, and apprehended 12,200 others. In 1965, the KBW was renamed as the Wojska Obrony Wewnętrznej (Internal Defense Force). It was included in the framework of National Defense.

There is substantial variation within this range, and the Green Acouchi, as currently recognized, may contain more than one species. Because the application of the scientific name acouchy, currently in use for the Red Acouchi, has historically been disputed, the name Myoprocta acouchy has sometimes been used for this species instead of Myoprocta pratti.Voss, R.S., Lunde, D.P. and Simmons, N.B. 2001.

The species is named for Antwerp Edgar Pratt who was a British naturalist.  Description  An adult green acouchi weighs around , and has a short tail. The acouchi is a frugivore and so is prone to the dental disease caries. Behavior Green acouchis are diurnal, surface dwelling rodents and have a complex array of behavior patterns relating to social interaction. In addition, they are food hoarders, employing a scatter hoarding strategy. Reproduction Female acouchis have an average oestrus cycle length of around 43 days and have a set breeding season between autumn-spring with a 99-day gestation. Females produce small litters of relatively precocial young, mothers produce a 'purring' vocalisation to maintain contact with young. Unusually pregnant acouchis do not specifically nest build but will instead choose a preferred nest site for the first week of lactation. Mothers can become very aggressive after parturition and raise their litters in isolation; weaning is extended and young remain with the mother for several weeks or months post-weaning to benefit from the mother's protection.

It formed in 2002 with the amalgamation of Kelvin Grove State High School and Kelvin Grove State School and is one of the largest government educational institutions in Australia. The school is recognised for its emphasis on the performing arts, achievements in all facets of school life and its cultural diversity reflecting the experience of inner city Brisbane communities. The amalgamation was an initiative of the Government of Queensland's Smart State initiative. The name was voted upon by students, staff and administration in 2001 from a selection of choices. Thus, the school became a P-12 (prep to year twelve) school for state enrolments. The amalgamation also created 3 sub schools; 'The Junior School' catering for grades prep to 5, 'The Middle School' catering for grades 6 to 9 and 'The Senior School' catering for grades 10 to 12. In 2006 the school joined the Healthy State system and removed a large proportion of junk food, including all soft drinks. In 2016, Kelvin Grove State College became an independent public school. In 2017, Kelvin Grove announced Michele Bridges as their Nutrition Ambassador for the Sporting Excellence programs. Motto The school's motto is 'The Pursuit of Excellence With All Thy Might'. The old motto ,which appears in the school anthem, 'Scientia ad Sidera' (Latin for 'knowledge to the stars'), was the Kelvin Grove State High School motto before amalgamation. The motto of Kelvin Grove State School, 'With All Thy Might' remains an underlying principle of the school, and awards under the name of this motto are awarded for high levels of drive and passion, regardless of academic performance. On most certificates, awards and emblems, the motto, 'With All Thy Might' is used.  Schools of excellence  As of 2013, the College has a number of schools of excellence, which students can choose to extend their learning choices in a particular field. They are: (Year Levels available to) * Engineering Technology School of Excellence (11-12) * Queensland Aviation School of Excellence (10-12) * Queensland Dance School of Excellence (7-9) * Queensland Golf School of Excellence (4-12) * Queensland Football School of Excellence (6-12) * Queensland Tennis School of Excellence (5-12) * Art and Design School of Excellence (11-12) * Music School of Excellence (3-12) * Queensland Senior Ballet Program (10-12) Some limitations do apply to entry and an audition process is usually required to gain entry. All these schools of excellence are an extra cost to the free education provided by a state school. Limited scholarships are available to some applicants. Isaka Cernak & Adam Sarota who play for Brisbane Roar as well as Robbie Kruse who plays for Melbourne Victory and Scott Higgins who is signed for Gold Coast United in the A-league are former students with KGSC's Soccer Excellence. David Williams (footballer) is another former student of the Soccer Excellence. Williams now plays for The Wellington Phoenix has two caps for the Socceroos (Australian National Team). Arts The Performing Arts Department offers courses in drama, dance and music with links to QUT’s \\"Creative Industries\\" program. Students can also expand their performing arts studies with the following specialised programs: *Queensland Senior Ballet Program (QBSP) in partnership with Queensland Ballet (Years 10-12) QBSP is a comprehensive, part-time program which consists of four hours of dance training in the mornings and three hours of academic classes each weekday afternoon, with a further five hours of dance training on Saturdays. Kelvin Grove also has the largest Visual Art department in Queensland, with a dedicated art faculty and computer design laboratories. Kelvin Grove music student Sarah Bakker has performed in numerous roles including the understudy in Phantom Of The Opera, the cast toured around Australia in 2008 and 2009. Many QDSE dancers, vocalists, choir members and a select group of musicians have taken part in celebrations and concerts such as the Q150 Creative Generations concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. Kelvin Grove has an excellent Instrumental Music Program. In 2013, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble and Corelli Strings toured to Sydney. The Percussion Ensemble perform regularly at school events and competitions throughout Brisbane.  Sporting houses  There are four sporting houses at KGSC which were also the sporting houses of KGSHS: # Herbert # Lutwyche # Petrie # Bowen The houses were originally based on the first letter surname, however, to even out the numbers in each house this has become less obvious. In previous years, members of Schools of Excellence were all placed in the same sporting house, however this was unfair on other houses and the policy was scrapped. The names of the houses are all derived from important persons in the development of Queensland. Many suburbs near the school are also named after these people, and so many students have come to believe that the houses are named after the suburbs. The primary school used to have its own separate houses before amalgamation. They were Long (yellow), Bancroft (red) and Walker (Blue). Long and Walker were both long serving principals from the early years of KGSS, while Bancroft was a local person of importance.

The objective of these technologies is to render an image more usable by Fourier or other filtering techniques. These technologies were most actively advanced in the 1960s and early 1970s in the fields of strategic reconnaissance and medical electronics. The term Digital ICE initially applied specifically to a proprietary technology developed by Kodak's Austin Development Center, formerly Applied Science Fiction (ASF), that automatically removes surface defects, such as dust and scratches, from scanned images.  Technology  The ICE technology works from within the scanner, so unlike the software-only solutions it does not alter any underlying details of the image. Subsequent to the original Digital ICE technology (circa 1989), which used infrared cleaning, additional image enhancement technologies were marketed by Applied Science Fiction and Kodak under similar and related names, often as part of a suite of compatible technologies. The ICE technology uses a scanner with a pair of light sources, a normal RGB lamp and an infrared (IR) lamp, and scans twice, once with each lamp. The IR lamp detects the dust locations with its unique detection method, and then inpainting is applied based on this data afterwards. The general concept is locate scratches and dust on the RGB image and mask them. = Limitations of Digital ICE = Digital ICE is used to detect scratches and dust during transparent film scan and is not applicable for opaque document scanning. While chromogenic black-and-white films are supported by Digital ICE, other black-and-white films containing metallic silver, which form from silver halides during the development process of the film, are not. This is because the long wave infrared light passes through the slide but not through dust particles. The silver particles reflect the infrared light in a similar manner to dust particles, thus respond equally in visible light and infrared. A similar phenomenon also prevents Kodak Kodachrome slides from being scanned with Digital ICE. Kodachrome's cyan layer absorbs infrared. = Further development = Kodak's own scanner, the \\"pro- lab\\" Kodak HR500 Plus was equipped with Digital ICE that could scan Kodachrome slides effectively; however, this scanner was discontinued in 2005. Nikon produced the Nikon Super Coolscan LS-9000 ED scanner with a new version of ICE (Digital ICE Professional) from 2004 until it was discontinued in 2010. This was capable of scanning Kodachrome slides reliably, dust- and scratch-free, without additional software. LaserSoft Imaging released an infrared dust and scratch removal tool (iSRD - Infrared Smart Removal of Defects) in 2008, that allows Nikon's film scanners for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, as well as many scanners from other manufacturers to make high quality scans of Kodachrome slides. Fujifilms system for dust and scratch removal, called \\"Image Intelligence\\", works on a similar principle as Digital ICE and will also work on Kodachrome film.

The character first appeared in Conan the Barbarian #15 (May 1972) as a foe of Conan. He was later fully integrated into the Marvel Universe, and became popular for his appearances in X-Men. In 2006, he was used in Dynamite Entertainment's revamped Red Sonja series.  Fictional character biography  =Conan era= Kulan Gath was a sorcerer in Earth's Hyborian Era, the ancient time period in which Conan the Barbarian lived. At some point, he marries the witch Vammatar in an alliance to obtain the power of the demon Shuma-Gorath. He has an apprentice named Razal Gulath, and is an enemy of the immortal vampire-like mutant named Selene. In his first appearance, he seeks the power of the Melnibonéan sorceress Terhali, who had been exiled to Earth and placed in suspended animation; when Terhali awoke, she disintegrated Kulan Gath with a magical bolt of energy. This proves to be only a setback for Kulan Gath, as he had achieved effective immortality by placing his life energy into a magical amulet. He eventually regains his body, allied with Vammatar, and fought Conan and Red Sonja. Kulan Gath and his bride were apparently destroyed when they attempted to control the demon Shuma-Gorath. Kulan Gath returned again in the miniseries Conan: The Flame and the Fiend, thanks to the efforts of his new wife, Armati, but he was killed by Conan. At some point, his body was restored, but his heart was cut out by Red Sonja; a silhouetted scene in Marvel Saga No. 1 suggests that this may have occurred with the assistance of Conan. =Modern adventures= Millennia later, Kulan Gath returned to life in the modern world when the necklace that housed his essence turned up at a museum display in New York City. The necklace was donned by a night watchman; the sorcerer transformed the guard's body into a duplicate of his own, which he then possessed. He was defeated by Red Sonja, who had been temporarily reincarnated in the present day in the body of Mary Jane Watson, and her newfound ally Spider-Man. Spider-Man later tossed the necklace off of a ferry bound for Staten Island, but it was found not long afterwards by a fisherman named Jaime Rodriquez; although Jaime resisted Kulan Gath, a mugger who subsequently killed him was considerably weaker in willpower, and when the mugger donned the necklace, he was possessed instantly and transformed by the wizard. Kulan Gath, now returned to the height of his power, transformed Manhattan into a likeness of his native time. Everyone trapped on the island believed that the transformed world was the true world, with the exceptions of his enemy Spider-Man and the modern-day Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange. Kulan Gath mystically bound Strange, and transformed Professor X and Caliban into a hybrid creature under his control. He also took control of the minds of the Avengers, the X-Men, the New Mutants and the Morlocks, who hunted down Spider-Man. In the end, Spider-Man and several other heroes were killed by Kulan Gath, his enemy Selene, or the mind-controlled agents of one of the two. Strange and the New Mutant Magik used their powers to change time so that the mugger who had originally killed Jaime Rodriquez and had been Kulan Gath's host had instead been slain by the time-travelling android Nimrod, creating a new divergent timeline in which all the changes and deaths caused by Gath never occurred. In the process of the mugger's death, Kulan Gath's amulet was lost in the New York City sewers; Gath, however, still possessed the memories of the original timeline. In gratitude for saving his life, Jaime took Nimrod into his home, unaware of the Sentinel's true nature. Yet another fisherman later found the amulet and was transformed into Kulan Gath's new host. Kulan Gath traveled to the Latin American nation of Costa Verde, and transformed the region inhabited by the fictional Kamekeri Native Americans as he had previously transformed Manhattan. The Avengers- currently consisting of the Wasp, Iron Man, She-Hulk, Warbird, Goliath, the Scarlet Witch and Triathlon, and accompanied by their ally Silverclaw, traveled to Costa Verde to stop him. He attempted to sacrifice Silverclaw's mother, the Kamekeri goddess Pelali, to his demonic gods, but Silverclaw was able to free her (though Pelali died from the effects of the ritual later). The gods, having been partially summoned, still required a sacrifice, and when no other victim was offered, they took the unwilling Kulan Gath to their native dimension. In the 2008 Spider-Man/Red Sonja mini-series, Gath was able to return to Earth when the amulet came into contact with a corrupt U.S. senator, providing him with a new body that he subsequently used to transform New York once again. Knowing that Red Sonja would return to fight him, Gath attempted to negate that threat by enchanting Sonja's blade so that she saw Spider-Man as an enemy, but Sonja was eventually able to overcome the spell and fought alongside the wall-crawler, encouraged to trust him by Mary Jane's residual memories. Seeking to enhance his power, Gath attempted to lure Venom to him, subsequently stealing the symbiote and bonding with it to become \\"Kulan Venom\\", intending to then sacrifice Red Sonja and use her holy blood, blessed by a goddess, to complete his dominion over this plane and then expand to all others. Despite his attempts to delay his adversaries by pitting them against altered versions of Vermin, Lizard, Scorpion and Hobgoblin, the symbiote's attempts to rejoin with Brock distracted Gath long enough for Sonja to destroy the amulet and break Gath's spell, thus restoring the world to normal. In Legenderry Red Sonja v2, he has a son named D'Nar. Other versions =Exiles= In Exiles #s 55-57, the Exiles visited an alternative universe where Kulan Gath's spell (from X-Men #s 189-191) was still active but controlled by Zarathos. At first, they were transformed by the spell, but were then freed by Illyana Rasputin and Spider- Man, who were working with Kulan Gath. Eventually, after helping Gath fight Zarathos, Werewolf by Night, Morbius and others, Heather Hudson turns into Tanaraq and kills Gath, leaving Selene to undo the spell. =Paradise X= In Paradise X, one of many alternate realities shown is a continuation of the original timeline in which Kulan Gath transformed Manhattan and killed Spider- Man. Gath went on to kill many other super-heroes and reverted the entire world back to a primitive age which he ruled over, turning the population into a barbarian army under his control. He had just executed Mr. Fantastic, symbolizing his final triumph over the modern age of science and super-human heroes, when alternate universe versions of X-51 and Hyperion arrived hoping to warn the people of that reality of the Celestial seed in the Earth's core. When Gath stated that the Celestial seed was the source of his power, Hyperion killed him, allowing X-51 to pass on information to the people of that reality to help them save their world.

He was a leader of the \\"Imperial school\\" of historians who studied the British Empire from the perspective of London, and generally praised the administrative efficiency and political fairness of the Empire. Career A native of Greeley, Colorado, Gipson moved with his family to Caldwell, Idaho, as a boy. After dropping out of high school, he worked at various odd jobs (such as mining and driving stage coaches), as well as at the family business, Caxton Press, which published Idaho Odd Fellow, the Gem State Rural and Livestock Farmer. Gipson graduated from the University of Idaho in 1903. He was then selected to be one of the first Rhodes Scholars. Receiving his B.A. from Oxford University in 1907 he said: \\"One disadvantage that our first delegation of Rhodes Scholars labored under was the fact that we attracted so much attention. I am sure that no subsequent group was ever the object of such intense curiosity. Almost inevitably we were made conscious that each of us was on trial, especially in the eyes of the scholarly world. We were even made to feel that in a sense the reputation of American scholarship was in our hands.\\" Returning to the United States, Gipson taught at The College of Idaho for three years and, in 1909, married Jeannette Reed (who died in 1967). He then attended Yale University as a Farnham Fellow from 1910 to 1911 before being named head of the history department at Wabash College, a position he held until 1924. While teaching at Wabash, he received his Ph.D. from Yale University, in 1918. He studied with the eminent colonialist Charles M. Andrews and received the university's John Addison Porter Prize for that year. Historian In 1924, Gipson was appointed professor of history at Lehigh University, a position he held until his death. Although best known as a historian of Colonial America and its place in the British Empire, two of Gipson's earliest articles had to do with the Civil War and Reconstruction. His assessment of Andrew Johnson (\\"The Statesmanship of President Johnson: A Study of the Presidential Reconstruction Policy\\") was published in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review in December 1915; and \\"The Collapse of the Confederacy\\" appeared in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review in March 1918. His Yale doctoral dissertation, which was written under the guidance of Charles M. Andrews, was accepted in 1918 and published two years later by Yale University Press as Jared Ingersoll: A Study of American Loyalism in Relation to British Colonial Government (1920), for which he received the Justin Winsor Prize from the American Historical Association. He contributed seven entries to the Dictionary of American Biography, and three articles to the Dictionary of American History. Gipson's magnum opus was the fifteen-volume series The British Empire Before the American Revolution (15 vols., 1936–70) - the first three volumes were published by The Caxton Printers in Caldwell, Idaho, and the remaining volumes were published by Alfred A. Knopf in New York. Gipson spent decades on the project, completing the final volume only shortly before his death. Three of the volumes were given significant historical prizes: *The Great War for the Empire: The Years of Defeat, 1754-1757 (volume 6): The 1948 Columbia University Loubat Prize *The Great War for the Empire: The Victorious Years, 1758-1760 (volume 7): The 1950 Bancroft Prize of Columbia University *The Triumphant Empire: Thunderclouds Gather in the West, 1763-1766 (volume 10): The 1962 Pulitzer Prize in History Gipson believed that the American Revolution was a direct result of changes that occurred in the British Empire after 1763, due to Britain's victory in the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War, which he referred to as \\"The Great War for the Empire.\\" His thesis is succinctly presented in his article \\"The American Revolution as an Aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754-1763,\\" which was published in the March 1950 issue of Political Science Quarterly. He paid tribute to his mentor in \\"Charles McLean Andrews and the Re-orientation of the Study of American Colonial History,\\" which appeared in the July 1935 issue of the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography. One of Gipson's last publications was the introduction to a 1969 Festschrift for Ross J. S. Hoffman, who was a history professor at Fordham University. Gipson noted that he himself was a member of the Congregational Church and a descendant of the pilgrim William Brewster, while Hoffman was a convert to Roman Catholicism and a staunch defender of that faith - and yet they were good friends. Gipson died on September 26, 1971, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; his ashes were buried in Caldwell. He left his entire estate to Lehigh University, providing the core funding for the Gipson Institute.

Early life and college career Anderson attended St. Xavier High School, which was also attended by MLB players Paul Byrd, Chris Burke, and Jack Savage. After high school, he went on to Rice University. In 1995, Anderson was a Southwest Conference all-star. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1997 he was a Western Athletic Conference all-star and a First Team College All-American. Anderson set Rice University records for career wins (30) and saves (14), and also posted a 1.82 earned run average (ERA) during his final year with the team. In the 1997 amateur entry draft, Anderson was selected first overall by the Detroit Tigers. He eventually signed with the team for a $2.5 million signing bonus. Professional career Anderson was named the 24th best prospect in 1998 by Baseball America. In 1998, he was called up by the Tigers from the minors, where he had an ERA under 0.70. In his first Major League season, he went 5–1 with a 3.27 ERA in 42 games. He also struck out 44 batters in 44 innings pitched. Anderson's numbers were never again as impressive as those of his rookie season, although he was able to record 22 saves (with a 4.82 ERA) in 2001. In May 2002, Anderson tore a muscle in the armpit of his throwing arm while throwing a bullpen session. Earlier the same day, he had participated in a Tigers- sponsored fan octopus-throwing contest along with Jeff Weaver, leading to the perception (though disputed by Anderson) that he'd torn the muscle in hopes of winning Detroit Red Wings playoff tickets. After returning from the injury, he was unable to hit 90 mph on his fastball in his remaining days in Detroit, after regularly topping 100 mph on the radar gun, including a high mark of 103 mph twice. After spending all of 2004 in AAA for the Tigers, Anderson made his final appearances in the bigs in 2005. Anderson walked 11 batters and gave up 19 hits in 10 innings with the Colorado Rockies that season. Anderson started the 2006 season with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies in the San Francisco Giants organization. After going 1–2 with a 9.17 ERA in 29 games in relief with them, he was released by the Giants and signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League, where he went 1–1 with a 4.11 ERA in 15 games. After not pitching at all in 2007, he was signed to a minor league contract with a non-roster invitation to spring training for 2008 by the Chicago White Sox. He did not make the team and pitched for the Charlotte Knights, the White Sox's Triple-A team. On January 14, 2011, Anderson signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. On April 2, 2011, he was released.

Background In 1987, Neil Hebert was arrested for armed robbery. He was informed of his rights and taken to an RCMP detachment. Upon consulting a lawyer, he said he was not going to make any statements. Hebert was put in a cell with an undercover agent posing as another arrested suspect. The undercover agent chatted with Hebert and managed to elicit several incriminating statements from him. At trial, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of the conversation. The judge found that Hebert's right to counsel under section 10(b) of the Charter, and his right to remain silent under section 7 were violated. On appeal the court found that Hebert's rights were not violated and a new trial was ordered. Opinion of the Court Beverley McLachlin, writing for the majority, held that the evidence was inadmissible and upheld the trial judge's ruling. McLachlin found that the right to silence was a principle of fundamental justice and as such was protected under section 7. Once in police custody, an accused's right cannot be undermined through acts of police trickery. However, if the accused were to divulge information to an informer or undercover agent of their own free will then the statements could be used against them.

The Americans captured the British vessel after a one-sided cannonade, but the British merchant convoy escaped. Prelude USS Peacock was one of a class of three heavy sloops-of-war designed by William Doughty,Forester, pp.168–169 and was named after the victory the previous year over the Royal Navy brig . Peacock sortied from New York on 12 March 1814 and, having eluded the British blockade, delivered some stores to St. Marys, Georgia. Peacock was then supposed to rendezvous with the frigate , but President had been unable to break out of New York. While waiting for President to appear, Warrington cruised around the Bahamas, hoping to intercept British merchant ships sailing from Jamaica. Early on the morning of 28 April, several sail were sighted to windward. They belonged to a small convoy that had sailed from Havana on 23 April, escorted by Epervier. When the convoy sighted Peacock the merchant ships made all sail to escape, while Epervier prepared to engage. The British vessel was more lightly armed than the American. Epervier carried sixteen 32-pounder carronades and two 18-pounder carronades as bow chasers. Peacock carried twenty 32-pounder carronades and two 12-pounder guns. The ratio of the vessels' broadsides was 256 pounds to 320. Battle As the two vessels made toward each other, the wind shifted to the southward, giving neither Peacock nor Epervier the advantage of the windward position.Roosevelt, p.173 At about 10:20 in the morning, both ships fired their starboard broadsides on opposite tacks, aiming high to disable their opponent's rigging. Both vessels received damage aloft, after which Epervier turned downwind and engaged Peacock on a parallel course. Peacock directed her fire against Eperviers hull with great effect. The British fire fell away rapidly, and Epervier probably scored no hits after the first broadside from the port battery. After 40 minutes, Epervier was badly damaged, with 45 shot holes in the hull, and of water in the hold. Commander Wales summoned boarding parties to muster, intending to board and capture Peacock, but his crew refused.Forester, p.172 At 11:05, Epervier struck her colours. Epervier had eight men killed and 15 wounded (about 20 percent of the crew.) Aftermath The Americans repaired the damage to Peacocks rigging within an hour. Peacocks first lieutenant took charge of the prize and succeeded in preventing it from sinking; the prize crew had the brig ready to sail by nightfall. Epervier was found to be carrying $118,000 in specie, which was private rather than Government property.Forester, p.170 The next day, The Americans sighted two British frigates. Peacock successfully decoyed them away from Epervier and also herself escaped, with the result that both vessels reached Savannah, Georgia, a few days later. The Americans repaired Epervier and took her into the United States Navy as USS Epervier. Warrington set out again in Peacock and made a successful raiding cruise in British waters, capturing 14 merchant vessels. Results The victory of Peacock over Epervier was one of the most one-sided of the War of 1812, even though the two opposing vessels were not grossly disparate in strength. It was stated that although Peacocks fire had dismounted some of Eperviers carronades, more of them fell from their mounts when they were fired. Wales had carried out little of the gunnery practice that would have revealed defects in the guns or carriages before it was too late to remedy them.Forester, p.172 Wales had also reported disaffection and unrest among his crew and, unusually for the Royal Navy in the War of 1812, they failed in their duty to fight to their utmost. The court martial (on 20 January 1815) revealed that Epervier had the worst crew of any vessel on her station. In particular, her crew consisted mostly of invalids from the hospital. Post script On 21 October 1814, Congress passed a resolution that in honour of their capture of Epervier, each of Peacocks officers would receive a silver medal and each of her midshipmen would receive a sword.

Peter Timothy was from his early years a Patriot, was known to join in from time to time around the Liberty Tree, and expressed his views in the Gazette. When, in 1780, as Charleston prepared again for an invasion by the British, Peter Timothy boarded a ship with Colonel John Laurens (e.g., John's March 4, 1780 letter to his father), to chase the British and keep his Journal reporting on the events of the time, making Peter Timothy one of America's earliest war correspondents. However, when Charleston was captured in May, 1780, the Gazette was seized by the British and given to the Tory Robert Wells, who continued it as the Royal Gazette, reflecting the British perspective. In August Peter Timothy was one of almost 100 leading citizens dragged out of his house and put aboard the prison ship Sandwich, headed for prison in St. Augustine while their families are exiled to Philadelphia because \\"there are too many plots a-foot.\\" Although another prisoner, Christopher Gadsden, reports that all have arrived safely enough, he apparently did not know that Peter Timothy had not arrived.

The outnumbered French repelled several Allied assaults on their right flank, but their center and left flank were overcome and Soult was compelled to retreat. At first the withdrawal was conducted in good order, but it eventually ended in a scramble for safety and many French soldiers became prisoners. The engagement occurred near the end of the Peninsular War. In mid-February, Wellington's army broke out of its small area of conquered territory near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a pause in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse. Preliminaries =Armies= The Battle of the Nive ended on 13 December 1813 when Wellington's army repulsed the last of Soult's assaults. This ended the fighting for the year. Soult had found the Allied army divided by the Nive River but failed to inflict a damaging defeat. The French then pulled back within Bayonne's defenses and entered winter quarters. Heavy rains brought operations to a standstill for the next two months. After the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813, Wellington's Spanish troops had gone out of control in seized French villages. Horrified at the idea of provoking a guerilla war by French civilians, the British commander imposed a vigorous discipline on his British and Portuguese soldiers and sent most of his Spanish troops home. Since his men were paid and fed by the British government, Pablo Morillo's Spanish division remained with the army. Wellington's policy paid dividends; his soldiers soon found that guarding the roads in his army's rear areas was no longer required. In January 1814, Soult sent reinforcements to Napoleon. Transferred to the Campaign in Northeast France were the 7th and 9th Infantry Divisions and Anne-François-Charles Trelliard's dragoons. Altogether, this totaled 11,015 foot soldiers under Jean François Leval and Pierre François Xavier Boyer and 3,420 horsemen in the brigades of Pierre Ismert, François Léon Ormancey and Louis Ernest Joseph Sparre. This left Soult with the 1st Division under Maximilien Sébastien Foy (4,600 men), 2nd Division led by Jean Barthélemy Darmagnac (5,500 men), 3rd Division commanded by Louis Jean Nicolas Abbé (5,300), 4th Division directed by Eloi Charlemagne Taupin (5,600 men), 5th Division commanded by Jean-Pierre Maransin (5,000 men), 6th Division under Eugène-Casimir Villatte (5,200 men), 8th Division led by Jean Isidore Harispe (6,600 men) and Cavalry Division under Pierre Benoît Soult (3,800 men). Marshal Soult also commanded 7,300 gunners, engineers and wagon drivers plus the garrisons of Bayonne (8,800 men) and Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (2,400 men). Wellington's army consisted of the 1st Division under Kenneth Howard (6,898 men), 2nd Division commanded by William Stewart (7,780 men), 3rd Division led by Thomas Picton (6,626 men), 4th Division directed by Lowry Cole (5,952 men), 5th Division under Andrew Hay (4,553 men), 6th Division commanded by Henry Clinton (5,571 men), 7th Division led by George Townshend Walker (5,643 men), Light Division under Charles Alten (3,480 men), Portuguese Division directed by Carlos Lecor (4,465 men) and Spanish Division led by Morillo (4,924 men). Stapleton Cotton commanded three British light cavalry brigades under Henry Fane (765 men), Hussey Vivian (989 men) and Edward Somerset (1,619 men). There were also three independent infantry brigades, 1,816 British led by Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 2,185 Portuguese under John Wilson and 1,614 Portuguese directed by Thomas Bradford. =Operations= Map of Pyrenées-Atlantiques department shows Bayonne on the coast at left, Saint-Palais on the Bidouze at lower center and Orthez on the Gave de Pau at right center. Wellington planned to use the greater part of his army to drive the bulk of Soult's army well to the east, away from Bayonne. Once the French army was pressed sufficiently far to the east, a strong Allied corps would seize a bridgehead over the Adour River to the west of Bayonne and encircle that fortress. Because Soult's army was weakened by three divisions, Wellington's forces were superior enough to risk dividing them into two bodies. Soult wished to contain his opponent in a wedge of occupied French territory. Strongly garrisoned Bayonne blocked the north side of the Allied- occupied area. East of the city, three French divisions held the line of the Adour to Port-de-Lanne. The east side of the Allied-occupied area was defended by four French divisions along the Joyeuse River as far south as Hélette. Cavalry patrols formed a cordon from there to the fortress of Saint-Jean-Pied- de-Port in the Pyrenees. On 14 February, Wellington launched his offensive toward the east. On the right flank was Rowland Hill's 20,000-man corps which included the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, Lecor's Portuguese and Morillo's Spanish divisions and Fane's cavalry. Hill's main column struck toward Harispe's division at Hélette. Picton moved on the left flank against Villatte's division at Bonloc and Morillo took his men through the foothills on the right flank. On 15 February, Hill's column defeated Harispe's division in the Battle of Garris and forced the French to abandon Saint-Palais and the line of the Bidouze River. Marquess Wellington The 25,400-strong Allied left flank corps under William Beresford began its advance on 16 February, aiming for the village of Bidache. Beresford's corps was made up of the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Division as well as Somerset's and Vivian's cavalry. Altogether, Wellington had 42,000 foot soldiers and 3,000 horsemen marching to the east. Reacting to the Allied pressure, Soult joined two of the three divisions north of the Adour to the four divisions farther east. This action created a field army of 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. The French divisions were directed to form a new line behind the Gave d'Oloron River, along a line from Peyrehorade to Sauveterre-de-Béarn to Navarrenx. On 17 February, Hill's corps forded the Saison River, breaching yet another French defensive line. The French marshal sent Abbé's division to help defend Bayonne, a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight Wellington. By 18 February, Soult had his troops in position on the Gave d'Oloron. That day the weather broke again, causing another pause in operations. During the lull, Wellington ordered John Hope's corps to begin the isolation of Bayonne. Since Adour is wide with a tidal rise of below Bayonne, Soult never suspected the Allies would cross there and did not guard the north bank. Facing an Allied offensive that required crossing rivers, the French marshal believed that his foes would not have enough boats or pontoons to bridge the river. Hope sent eight companies from the 1st Division across the Adour on 23 February to form a bridgehead. That evening Congreve rockets dispersed two French battalions that were sent to investigate the incursion. The next day 34 vessels of 30 to 50 tons sailed into the mouth of the Adour, were moored together and a roadway was built across their decks. By the evening of 26 February, Hope marched 15,000 of his 31,000 men over the bridge onto the north bank. After sustaining 400 casualties in a successful bid to capture the Sainte-Étienne suburb, the Allies encircled Bayonne on 27 February. French casualties were only 200 in the action. The siege was pursued in a lackadaisical fashion until 14 April when the bloody and pointless Battle of Bayonne erupted. On 24 February, Wellington launched a new offensive against Soult's army. For this operation, Hill was reinforced by the 6th and Light Divisions. Beresford with two divisions mounted a feint attack against the northern end of the French line. Picton was supposed to demonstrate opposite Sauveterre but he exceeded his orders. He found an apparently unguarded ford about from the bridge and pushed four light companies from John Keane's brigade across. After a steep climb, they reached high ground only to be overpowered by a battalion of the 119th Line Infantry from Villatte's division. In their flight down the slope and across the river, about 30 men were captured and a few drowned; about 80 of the 250 men became casualties. Hill built a boat bridge and thrust 20,000 troops across the Gave d'Oloron at Viellenave-de-Navarrenx between Sauveterre and Navarrenx. With his latest position compromised, Soult ordered a retreat to Orthez on the Gave de Pau River. Battle =Plans and forces= A map of the Battle of Orthez shows Allied units in white and French units in black and white. North is down. Since Wellington was anxious not to bring on an engagement, he tried to flank Soult out of position. He sent Beresford to cross the Gave de Pau downstream at Lahontan and circle around Soult's right flank. At the same time, Hill's corps moved directly toward Orthez. By 25 February, Soult had massed his army at Orthez and courted battle with the Allies. The French marshal counted 33,000 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 48 field guns. Wellington could bring 38,000 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 54 artillery pieces against the French. Five battalions were absent: 1/43rd Foot and 1/95th Rifles from the Light Division, 2nd Provisional from 4th Division, 79th Foot from 6th Division and 51st Foot from 7th Division. Confronted with Soult in a fighting mood, the British commander planned to send Beresford to break Soult's right flank while Picton and three divisions kept the French center busy. Meanwhile, Hill's corps was to attack Orthez, get across the Gave de Pau and envelop the French left flank. With luck, Soult would be crushed between Beresford and Hill. Comte d'Erlon At Orthez, the Gave de Pau runs approximately from southeast to northwest. Since Beresford was already on the same side of the Gave de Pau, the river only protected Soult's position to the east of Orthez. However, there is an east–west ridge on the north side of Orthez that ends at the village of Saint-Boès on the west. The ridge is about high and the road from Orthez to Dax runs along its crest. However, the knolls at the Lafaurie, Luc and Plassotte Farms were even higher, the last-named rose above Saint-Boès. The three high points were crowned with French artillery. Aside from Saint-Boès, the ridge can be approached from the west by two spurs with marshy ground in between. Soult posted four and one-half divisions along this ridge, one division in Orthez and one division in reserve. Unlike the other divisions which had two brigades, Harispe's division contained three brigades. His third brigade under Marie Auguste Paris was detached to the right flank. Going from right to left, the ridge was held by the divisions of Taupin, Claude Pierre Rouget, Darmagnac and Foy. Rouget was in temporary command of Maransin's division. Harispe's remaining two brigades held Orthez while Villatte's division was in reserve north of Orthez. Honoré Charles Reille commanded Taupin, Rouget and Paris on the right flank, Jean Baptiste Drouet, comte d'Erlon led Darmagnac and Foy in the center and Bertrand Clausel supervised Harispe and Villatte on the left flank. Pierre Soult's cavalry was scattered. The 2nd Hussars and the 22nd Chasseurs-à-Cheval were near Pau and out of the battle. The 13th, 15th and 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval were detached to Harispe, D'Erlon and Reille, respectively, while the 5th and 10th Chasseurs-à- Cheval were in reserve. Wellington planned to send Cole's 4th Division supported by Walker's 7th Division to attack the western end of the ridge under the direction of Beresford. Picton would lead his own 3rd Division and Clinton's 6th Division in pinning the French center. Hill's corps was ordered to feint against Orthez with a Portuguese brigade and hold his two divisions ready to cross the Gave de Pau to the east of Orthez. Alten's Light Division was placed under cover behind an old Roman camp where Wellington set up his headquarters. The camp was located between Beresford's and Picton's columns. The 44,402-strong Allied army included 3,373 light cavalry in three brigades and 1,512 gunners, engineers and wagon drivers. Morillo's division was besieging Navarrenx while five British battalions were not present in the field while being issued fresh uniforms. The 1st Hussars King's German Legion (KGL) Regiment was part of the Allied cavalry. =Action= Lowry Cole The morning of 27 February 1814 saw a light frost, but the ground was not frozen. At 8:30 a.m. the 4th Division assaulted Taupin's soldiers at Saint-Boès. The initial rush seized the church which stood on a separate hill. The brigade of Robert Ross swept through Saint-Boès but was repulsed by the battery on the Plassotte knoll. When his soldiers fell back into the village, Cole brought up a KGL battery to duel with Taupin's guns. The battery immediately became the target of the French batteries on the Plassotte and Luc knolls; two guns were knocked out and Captain Frederick Sympher was killed. Cole deployed José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on Ross' right and sent his line forward again. The result was a second repulse in which Ross went down with a wound. The subsequent counterattack by Taupin's troops recovered part of Saint-Boès. For a time there was a lull as the two sides fired away at each other from the houses, but Vasconcellos' men had no cover and began to edge backward. Wellington sent over the 1st Caçadores Battalion from the Light Division. Cole's line collapsed just as the reinforcement arrived. Taupin recovered the entire village and drove the Allies back to their starting point. Ross' brigade suffered 279 casualties and Vasconcellos' brigade lost 295. Eloi Taupin Picton's probing attacks against the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's position and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs were deep and muddy, both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved forward until it came into contact with Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press any farther. For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack to make progress as the two sides skirmished. Wellington quickly changed his plans after seeing his flank attack fail. He converted his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held back only 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Caçadores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn and replaced by the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Boès broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed to the left and John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade was on the right. Taupin's tired soldiers, who had been fighting for about four hours, were driven back behind the Plassotte knoll where they rallied. Maximilien Foy When it advanced, Brisbane's brigade came under artillery fire that caused many casualties. The brigade finally reached some dead ground where the guns could not hit them, but French skirmishers began picking off the soldiers. After some urging by Edward Pakenham, Brisbane continued the attack. The 1/45th Foot fought its way close to the top of the ridge where Joseph François Fririon's brigade of Foy's division held the ridgeline. On the left of Brisbane's brigade, the 1/88th Foot had two companies guarding the divisional artillery battery as it began pounding the French line. Soult spotted the threat and ordered a squadron of the 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval to charge. The cavalry overran the two companies, inflicting heavy losses, and then went after the gunners. The remaining companies of the 88th immediately opened fire on the French horsemen, mowing most of them down. The 21st Chasseurs went into combat 401 strong but 11 days later reported only 236 men on active duty. The 88th Foot suffered 269 killed and wounded, by far the most of any British unit. Thomas Picton While Foy walked behind his front line units, a shrapnel shell burst over his head, driving a bullet into his left shoulder. His wounding disheartened his soldiers, who began falling back. At about the same time, Brisbane's brigade was replaced in the front line by two brigades of Clinton's 6th Division. These fresh troops fired a volley from close range and advanced with the bayonet, driving the French down the ridge's rear slope. Pierre André Hercule Berlier's brigade of Foy's division, which was closer to Orthez, fell back after Fririon's retreat exposed its flank. With Berlier gone, Harispe's two battalions in Orthez were compelled to retreat in order to avoid capture. On the left spur, Picton's two brigades under Keane and Power pressed against Darmagnac's division. After Foy's division gave way, Darmagnac retreated to the next ridge in the rear, where his troops took position on the right of Villatte's division. The divisional batteries of Picton and Clinton zeroed in on the new French position. Rouget's division and Paris' brigade apparently began to pull back after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and drive a wedge into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men across some marshy ground and then up the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold at the top of the ridge on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to save all but two of its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's division and Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies. John Buchan's brigade skirmished with the French defenders of Orthez all morning. Having received orders to cross the Gave de Pau, Hill got his troops marching for the Souars Ford at 11:00 am. Arriving there, the 12,000 Anglo-Portuguese brushed aside the cavalry regiment and two battalions of the 115th Line Infantry Regiment defending the ford. Hill's troops were soon across the river in strength and pressing back Harispe's outnumbered division. They were joined by Buchan's Portuguese who crossed at the Orthez bridge the moment the town's defenders pulled out. Joined by some newly arrived conscript battalions, Harispe attempted to make a stand at the Motte de Tury heights. The raw recruits proved to be poor fighting material; Hill's men broke Harispe's line and captured three guns. Wellington's Spanish liaison officer, Miguel Ricardo de Álava y Esquivel, was hit by a spent bullet during the advance. As Wellington was teasing Álava, he was knocked off his horse when a bullet-sized canister shot struck his sword hilt. In pain from a badly bruised hip, the British army commander remounted and continued to direct the battle. At this time, Soult realized that Hill's column might cut off his army from the Orthez to Sault-de-Navailles road. He ordered his army to retreat, covered by Villatte, Darmagnac, Rouget and Paris. At first, the tricky withdrawal was conducted in good order, though it was closely followed by British horse artillery and infantry. Because they had to retreat on narrow paths and across country, the retreating French units became badly mixed and unit cohesion was lost. Fearful of capture, the retreating soldiers became more and more confused and demoralized. Villatte and Harispe covered the withdrawal. At Sallespisse the troops from the French right and center poured into the main road. Soldiers from Villatte's division held that village until expelled by the 42nd Foot (Black Watch) in a hard fight. For the final to the Sault-de-Navailles bridge, most of Soult's army was a mob. That the cavalry brigades of Fane, Vivian and Somerset did not wreak havoc on the French was due to the terrain, which was criss-crossed with walls and ditches. Only the 7th Hussars made an effective charge, riding down one battalion of the 115th Line and a French National Guard unit from Harispe's division. At Sault-de- Navailles, Soult's artillery chief Louis Tirlet set up a 12-gun battery to cover the bridge over the Luy de Béarn. Soult's beaten men flowed across the bridge and kept going until they reached Hagetmau. Villatte and Harispe's infantry and Pierre Soult's cavalry stayed in Sault-de-Navailles until 10:00 pm when they blew up the bridge and joined the retreat. Results Jean de Dieu Soult The French lost the battle on French soil as Soult lost six field guns and 3,985 men including 542 killed, 2,077 wounded and 1,366 prisoners. Foy and brigadiers Étienne de Barbot and Nicolas Gruardet were wounded. General of Brigade Jean-Pierre Béchaud of Taupin's division was killed. The Allies sustained losses of 367 killed, 1,727 wounded and 80 captured for a total of 2,174. Of these, Portuguese casualties numbered 156 killed, 354 wounded and 19 captured, while British losses were 211 killed, 1,373 wounded and 61 captured. In addition to battle casualties, many of the recently conscripted French soldiers promptly deserted. Soult did not attempt to defend the Luy de Béarn with his demoralized army. Instead he retreated north to Saint-Sever on the Adour. Soult was in a dilemma. He could not defend both the important southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided that trying to hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary at his back and that it would be difficult to obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days. Wishing to capitalize on Soult's failure to defend Bordeaux, Wellington sent Beresford and the 4th and 7th Divisions to seize the seaport. Beresford departed the Allied camp on 7 March and occupied Bordeaux on 12 March. Leaving the 7th Division as an occupation force, Beresford hurried back with the 4th Division to join Wellington on 19 March. During this period, Allied infantry strength fell to 29,000 which was why Wellington did not trouble Soult. To make up for the deficit, the British army commander called for his heavy cavalry brigades to join him. He also asked for 8,000 Spanish reinforcements to be forwarded to the army, the soldiers to be paid by the British treasury. The Battle of Toulouse would be fought on 10 April.

The circle above is transformed into the Joukowsky airfoil below. In applied mathematics, the Joukowsky transform, named after Nikolai Zhukovsky (who published it in 1910), is a conformal map historically used to understand some principles of airfoil design. The transform is : z = \\\\zeta + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}, where z = x + iy is a complex variable in the new space and \\\\zeta = \\\\chi + i \\\\eta is a complex variable in the original space. This transform is also called the Joukowsky transformation, the Joukowski transform, the Zhukovsky transform and other variations. In aerodynamics, the transform is used to solve for the two- dimensional potential flow around a class of airfoils known as Joukowsky airfoils. A Joukowsky airfoil is generated in the complex plane (z-plane) by applying the Joukowsky transform to a circle in the \\\\zeta-plane. The coordinates of the centre of the circle are variables, and varying them modifies the shape of the resulting airfoil. The circle encloses the point \\\\zeta = -1 (where the derivative is zero) and intersects the point \\\\zeta = 1. This can be achieved for any allowable centre position \\\\mu_x + i\\\\mu_y by varying the radius of the circle. Joukowsky airfoils have a cusp at their trailing edge. A closely related conformal mapping, the Kármán–Trefftz transform, generates the much broader class of Kármán–Trefftz airfoils by controlling the trailing edge angle. When a trailing edge angle of zero is specified, the Kármán–Trefftz transform reduces to the Joukowsky transform. General Joukowsky transform The Joukowsky transform of any complex number \\\\zeta to z is as follows: :\\\\begin{align} z &= x + iy = \\\\zeta + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}  &= \\\\chi + i \\\\eta + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\chi + i\\\\eta} \\\\[2pt] &= \\\\chi + i \\\\eta + \\\\frac{\\\\chi - i\\\\eta}{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2} \\\\[2pt] &= \\\\frac{\\\\chi\\\\left(\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2 + 1\\\\right)}{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2} + i\\\\frac{\\\\eta\\\\left(\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2 - 1\\\\right)}{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2}. \\\\end{align} So the real (x) and imaginary (y) components are: :\\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\frac{\\\\chi\\\\left(\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2 + 1\\\\right)}{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2}, \\\\[2pt] y &= \\\\frac{\\\\eta\\\\left(\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2 - 1\\\\right)}{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2}. \\\\end{align} =Sample Joukowsky airfoil= The transformation of all complex numbers on the unit circle is a special case. :\\\\zeta = \\\\sqrt{\\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2} = 1, \\\\quad \\\\text{which gives} \\\\quad \\\\chi^2 + \\\\eta^2 = 1. So the real component becomes x = \\\\frac{\\\\chi (1 + 1)}{1} = 2\\\\chi and the imaginary component becomes y = \\\\frac{\\\\eta (1 - 1)}{1} = 0. Thus the complex unit circle maps to a flat plate on the real-number line from −2 to +2. Transformation from other circles make a wide range of airfoil shapes. Velocity field and circulation for the Joukowsky airfoil The solution to potential flow around a circular cylinder is analytic and well known. It is the superposition of uniform flow, a doublet, and a vortex. The complex conjugate velocity \\\\widetilde{W} = \\\\widetilde{u}_x - i\\\\widetilde{u}_y, around the circle in the \\\\zeta-plane is : \\\\widetilde{W} = V_\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\alpha} + \\\\frac{i\\\\Gamma}{2\\\\pi(\\\\zeta - \\\\mu)} - \\\\frac{V_\\\\infty R^2 e^{i\\\\alpha}}{(\\\\zeta - \\\\mu)^2}, where : \\\\mu = \\\\mu_x + i \\\\mu_y is the complex coordinate of the centre of the circle, : V_\\\\infty is the freestream velocity of the fluid, : \\\\alpha is the angle of attack of the airfoil with respect to the freestream flow, : R is the radius of the circle, calculated using R = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(1 - \\\\mu_x\\\\right)^2 + \\\\mu_y^2}, : \\\\Gamma is the circulation, found using the Kutta condition, which reduces in this case to :: \\\\Gamma = 4\\\\pi V_\\\\infty R\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\alpha + \\\\sin^{-1}\\\\frac{\\\\mu_y}{R}\\\\right). The complex velocity W around the airfoil in the z-plane is, according to the rules of conformal mapping and using the Joukowsky transformation, : W = \\\\frac{\\\\widetilde{W}}{\\\\frac{dz}{d\\\\zeta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\widetilde{W}}{1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta^2}}. Here W = u_x - i u_y, with u_x and u_y the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively (z = x + iy, with x and y real-valued). From this velocity, other properties of interest of the flow, such as the coefficient of pressure and lift per unit of span can be calculated. A Joukowsky airfoil has a cusp at the trailing edge. The transformation is named after Russian scientist Nikolai Zhukovsky. His name has historically been romanized in a number of ways, thus the variation in spelling of the transform.  Kármán–Trefftz transform  chord length. The Kármán–Trefftz transform is a conformal map closely related to the Joukowsky transform. While a Joukowsky airfoil has a cusped trailing edge, a Kármán–Trefftz airfoil—which is the result of the transform of a circle in the \\\\zeta-plane to the physical z-plane, analogue to the definition of the Joukowsky airfoil—has a non-zero angle at the trailing edge, between the upper and lower airfoil surface. The Kármán–Trefftz transform therefore requires an additional parameter: the trailing-edge angle \\\\alpha. This transform is where b is a real constant that determines the positions where dz/d\\\\zeta = 0, and n is slightly smaller than 2. The angle \\\\alpha between the tangents of the upper and lower airfoil surfaces at the trailing edge is related to n as : \\\\alpha = 2\\\\pi - n\\\\pi, \\\\quad n = 2 - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}. The derivative dz/d\\\\zeta, required to compute the velocity field, is : \\\\frac{dz}{d\\\\zeta} = \\\\frac{4n^2}{\\\\zeta^2 - 1} \\\\frac{\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}\\\\right)^n \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}\\\\right)^n} {\\\\left[\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}\\\\right)^n - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta}\\\\right)^n \\\\right]^2}. =Background= First, add and subtract 2 from the Joukowsky transform, as given above: : \\\\begin{align} z + 2 &= \\\\zeta + 2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta} (\\\\zeta + 1)^2,  z - 2 &= \\\\zeta - 2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta} (\\\\zeta - 1)^2. \\\\end{align} Dividing the left and right hand sides gives : \\\\frac{z - 2}{z + 2} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\zeta - 1}{\\\\zeta + 1} \\\\right)^2. The right hand side contains (as a factor) the simple second-power law from potential flow theory, applied at the trailing edge near \\\\zeta = +1. From conformal mapping theory, this quadratic map is known to change a half plane in the \\\\zeta-space into potential flow around a semi-infinite straight line. Further, values of the power less than 2 will result in flow around a finite angle. So, by changing the power in the Joukowsky transform to a value slightly less than 2, the result is a finite angle instead of a cusp. Replacing 2 by n in the previous equation gives : \\\\frac{z - n}{z + n} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\zeta - 1}{\\\\zeta + 1} \\\\right)^n, which is the Kármán–Trefftz transform. Solving for z gives it in the form of equation . Symmetrical Joukowsky airfoils In 1943 Hsue-shen Tsien published a transform of a circle of radius a into a symmetrical airfoil that depends on parameter \\\\epsilon and angle of inclination \\\\alpha: : z = e^{i\\\\alpha} \\\\left(\\\\zeta - \\\\epsilon + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta - \\\\epsilon} + \\\\frac{2\\\\epsilon^2}{a + \\\\epsilon}\\\\right). The parameter \\\\epsilon yields a flat plate when zero, and a circle when infinite; thus it corresponds to the thickness of the airfoil.

He was a member of the Devětsil (Butterbur) movement in the 1920s and also worked as an editor and graphic designer for Devětsil's monthly magazine ReD (Revue Devětsilu). One of his major works on architecture theory is The Minimum Dwelling (1932).The Minimum Dwelling. mitpress.mit.edu. Life and career Teige was born in Prague. With evidently endless energy, he introduced modern art to Prague. Devětsil-sponsored exhibitions and events brought international avant-garde figures like Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Paul Klee, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Walter Gropius, among many others, to lecture and perform in Prague. Teige interpreted their work, sometimes literally, for the Czech audience. In his 1935 Prague lecture, André Breton paid tribute to his \\"perfect intellectual fellowship\\" with Teige and Nezval: \\"Constantly interpreted by Teige in the most lively way, made to undergo an all-powerful lyric thrust by Nezval, Surrealism can flatter itself that it has blossomed in Prague as it has in Paris.\\" \\"Surrealist situation of the object\\" in , p256 Although not an architect, Teige was an articulate and knowledgeable architecture critic, an active participant in CIAM, and friends with Hannes Meyer, the second director of the Bauhaus. From 1929 to 1930 he gave guest lectures at the Bauhaus in Dessau Dluhosch, Eric (ed.); Svacha, Rostislav (ed.) (1999) Karel Teige / 1900-1951: L’enfant terrible of the Czech modernist avant-garde. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Teige and Meyer both believed in a scientific, functionalist approach to architecture, grounded in Marxist principles. In 1929 he famously criticized Le Corbusier's Mundaneum project (planned for Geneva but never built) on the grounds that Corbusier had departed from rational functionalism, and was on his way to becoming a mere stylist. Teige believed that 'the only aim and scope of modern architecture is the scientific solution of exact tasks of rational construction.' After welcoming the Soviet army as liberators, Teige was silenced by the Communist government in 1948. In 1951 he died in Prague of a heart attack, said to be a result of a ferocious Soviet press campaign against him as a 'Trotskyism degenerate,' his papers were destroyed by the secret police, and his published work was suppressed for decades.

Operation RPG-22 (third from the bottom) with comparable Soviet/Russian rocket launchers The smoothbore container is made from two fibreglass parts; a main tube containing the rocket, and a telescoping forward extension, which slides over the barrel. In transport mode, both ends of the barrel are closed by plastic covers, which open when the weapon is extended. The firing mechanism is manually cocked by raising the rear sight. Lowering the rear sight de-cocks the weapon if there is no target. On firing, there is a backblast danger area behind the weapon, of at least 15 metres. The solid propellant motor completely burns out while the rocket is still in the barrel tube, accelerating it to about 133 metres per second. The weapon has simple pop-up sights graduated to ranges of 50, 150 and 250 metres. To keep training costs down, a reusable RPG-22 is available that fires a 30 mm subcalibre projectile, weighing 350g, to operational ranges. Handling is identical to that of the full calibre version, with the exception of the discharge noise and backblast.

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. It can also be itchy or painful. The condition can last for days to years. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria such as Staph. aureus. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Often a number of factors are involved. Other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function. Diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. Frequently an antifungal and antibacterial cream is also tried. Angular cheilitis is a fairly common problem, with estimates that it affects 0.7% of the population. It occurs most often in the 30s to 60s, although is also relatively common in children. In the developing world, iron and vitamin deficiencies are a common cause. Signs and symptoms Angular cheilitis – a fissure running in the corner of the mouth with reddened, irritated facial skin adjacent. A fairly mild case of angular cheilitis extending onto the facial skin in a young person (affected area is within the black oval). Angular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site (i.e. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. There is not usually any bleeding. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\\"collapse of jaws\\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling.  Causes  Angular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of angular cheilitis with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Angular cheilitis can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic. =Infection= The involved organisms are: * Candida species alone (usually Candida albicans), which accounts for about 20% of cases, * Bacterial species, either:  Staphylococcus aureus alone, which accounts for about 20% of cases,  β-hemolytic streptococci alone. These types of bacteria have been detected in between 8–15% of cases of angular cheilitis, but less commonly are they present in isolation, * Or a combination of the above organisms, (a polymicrobial infection) with about 60% of cases involving both C. albicans and S. aureus. Candida can be detected in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. This organism is found in the mouths of about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. This is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed \\"angular herpes simplex\\". A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir. =Irritation contact dermatitis= A famous sketch by Leonardo da Vinci in preparation to depict the face of Judas Iscariot in The Last supper. The subject shows overclosure of the jaws and loss of facial support around the mouth. Pronounced skin folds extending from the corner of the mouth. 22% of cases of angular cheilitis are due to irritants. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva more than any other part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular skin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture- related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning \\"to lick one’s lips\\"), or \\"factitious cheilitis\\" is applied to this habit. The term \\"cheilocandidiasis\\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.Gibson, Lawrence E., M.D., \\"Dry Skin\\" , Mayo Clinic The sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms. =Nutritional deficiencies= Several different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC. In general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). =Systemic disorders= Some systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome). =Drugs= Several drugs may cause AC as a side effect, by various mechanisms, such as creating drug-induced xerostomia. Various examples include isotretinoin, indinavir, and sorafenib. Isotretinoin (Accutane), an analog of vitamin A, is a medication which dries the skin. Less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis A,Kliegman: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 18th ed. which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin A in the form of vitamin supplements. Recreational drug users may develop AC. Examples include cocaine, methamphetamines, heroin, and hallucinogens. =Allergic contact dermatitis= Patch test Allergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. It is usually impossible to tell the difference between irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis without a patch test. =Loss of lower facial height= Severe tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. This can be corrected with onlays or crowns on the worn teeth to restore height or new dentures with \\"taller\\" teeth. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Diagnosis Photographic Comparison of: 1) a Canker Sore - inside the mouth, 2) Herpes, 3) Angular Cheilitis and 4) Chapped Lips. Angular cheilitis is normally a diagnosis made clinically. If the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. The lesions are normally swabbed to detect if Candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. Persons with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often also will have their denture swabbed in addition. A complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 (and possibly other B vitamins), and folate. =Classification= Angular cheilitis could be considered to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, angular cheilitis is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form angular cheilitis which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed \\"Candida-associated angular cheilitis\\", or less commonly, \\"monilial perlèche\\". Angular cheilitis can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).  Management There are four aspects to the treatment of angular cheilitis. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. This involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. Commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. Improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. This may require the construction of a new denture with an adjusted bite. Rarely, in cases resistant to normal treatments, surgical procedures such as collagen injections (or other facial fillers such as autologous fat or crosslinked hyaluronic acid) are used in an attempt to restore the normal facial contour. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. zinc oxide paste) at night. Thirdly, treatment of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. Diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario. Finally, if the condition appears resistant to treatment, investigations for underlying causes such as anemia or nutrient deficiencies or HIV infection. Identification of the underlying cause is essential for treating chronic cases. The lesions may resolve when the underlying disease is treated, e.g. with a course of oral iron or B vitamin supplements. Patch testing is recommended by some in cases which are resistant to treatment and where allergic contact dermatitis is suspected. Prognosis Most cases of angular cheilitis respond quickly when antifungal treatment is used. In more long standing cases, the severity of the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. Epidemiology AC is a relatively common condition, accounting for between 0.7 – 3.8% of oral mucosal lesions in adults and between 0.2 – 15.1% in children, though overall it occurs most commonly in adults in the third to sixth decades of life. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Angular cheilitis is the most common presentation of fungal and bacterial infections of the lips. Etymology The term \\"angular cheilitis\\" is from Ancient greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

The verses below read: The Mighty Combatant, the first in Fame, The lasting Glory of his Native Thame, Rash, & unthinking Men! at length be Wise, Consult your Safety, and Resign the Prize, Nor tempt Superior Force; but Timely Fly The Vigour of his Arm, the Quickness of his Eye. James Figg (1684 – 7 December 1734, surname sometimes spelt 'Fig') exhibited and taught methods of fighting with swords, cudgels and fists from a base in London in the eighteenth century. He is widely recognized as the first English bare-knuckle boxing champion, reigning from 1719 to 1730. Life James Figg was born in Thame in Oxfordshire, \\"during the reign of William III\\", and fought his early prize fights there. According to one source, he came to the attention of the Earl of Peterborough, who was a \\"staunch patron of all brave and manly sports\\", and who brought him to London. In 1719 he started his own school based at an amphitheatre in Tottenham Court Road, London, where he taught boxing, fencing, and quarterstaff. In 1720, he was fighting at an amphitheatre in Marylebone near the Oxford Road (now called Oxford Street). He also demonstrated his skills at booths and rings set up on parks and fields. In 1725, the poet John Byrom visited Figg's amphitheatre where, at a cost of 2s 6d, he saw Figg fight Ned Sutton. He reported: \\"Figg had a wound and bled pretty much; Sutton had a blow with a quarterstaff just upon his knee, which made him lame, so then they gave over\\". In June 1727, Sutton had his revenge over Figg, beating him at his own amphitheatre. Figg was forced to withdraw, having suffered a wound in the belly and being \\"Cloven in the Foot\\". On 11 October 1729, it was reported that Figg had been made gate-keeper to Upper St James's Park by the Earl of Essex. In October 1730, it was reported: \\"yesterday the invincible Mr. James Figg fought at his Amphitheatre Mr. Holmes, an Irishman, who keeps an Inn at Yaul near Waterford in Ireland, and came into England on purpose to fight this English Champion\\". It was reported that during the bout, Holmes had his wrist cut to the bone and was therefore forced to retire. It was stated that this fight was the two hundred and seventy-first contest fought by Figg without defeat. In December 1731, Figg contested a sword-fight with John Sparks before the vising Duke of Lorraine. Foreign ministers and Nobility were also stated to be in the audience for the fighting which took place at the New Theatre, Haymarket. Although records weren't kept as precisely at the time, the common belief is that Figg had a record of 269–1 in 270 fights. His only loss came when Ned Sutton beat him to claim the title. Figg demanded a rematch, which he won, and also went on to retire Sutton in a rubber match. After 1730 he largely gave up fighting, and relied on his three protégés to bring in spectators: Bob Whittaker, Jack Broughton, and George Taylor. Taylor took over Figg's business upon Figg's death in 1734, though Broughton went on to become his most famous protégé. Figg died on 7 December 1734 and was buried in St Marylebone Parish Churchyard on 12 December of that year. He left behind a wife and several children. https://iainabernethy.co.uk/article/james-figg- first-bare-knuckle-boxing-champion The Gentleman's Magazine of April 1735, published the following epigram: > Brave Figg is conquer'd, who had conquer'd all, Yet death can boast but > little by his fall, For, half afraid, he threw a leaden dart, And maim'd > him, e'er he pierc'd his noble heart. Th' undaunted hero, grimly, as he > fell, Look'd for his arms, and swore by heav'n and hell, Death never should > his conquest have secur'd Had he fought fairly with a staff or sword. Legacy * Captain John Godfrey, who had been trained in sword-fighting by Figg and who later wrote A Treatise Upon the Useful Science of Defence, refers to Figg as the \\"Atlas of the Sword\\". * Jack Dempsey called him the father of modern boxing, although this accolade has also been awarded to Jack Broughton. Many of the bouts at the time consisted of boxing, wrestling and fencing with sharp swords. Figg was also a great fencer who engaged in sword duels and singlestick matches. * Pugilism.org describes Figg as one of the 5 Hardest Men of the Pugilistic Era and founder of the modern sport of boxing.Figg on the Pugilism.org website * Figg was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.James Figg on the IBHF Website *In 2010, Figg was inducted in the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame. * A blue plaque dedicated to him was unveiled at The James Figg Pub (formerly The Greyhound Inn), Cornmarket, Thame, on 14 April 2011.James FIGG (1684–1734). Oxfordshire Blue Plaques * William Hogarth painted his portrait. =Relationship with William Hogarth= James Figg features as the mounted swordsman, bottom right, in Hogarth's Southwark Fair William Hogarth was reputedly a friend and fan. Figg sometimes featured in his pictures, such as Southwark Fair (where he can be seen riding a horse on the far right). It is not unlikely that Hogarth used Figg as model for some of his well known works such as A Rake’s ProgressJames Figg on BBC Oxford and A Midnight Modern Conversation.A Midnight Modern Conversation (1733) on the website of the Royal Collection Trust But as records in this time are unreliable (Hogarth himself warned against finding likenesses of individuals in his depiction of drunks, stating that \\"We lash the Vices but the Persons spare\\")A Midnight Modern Conversation on the website of the Indianapolis Museum of Art this cannot be ascertained with certainty. A typical example is James Figgs' trade card which was believed to be engraved by Hogarth,James Figgs'trade card on the website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art but the general consensus is that it was engraved by somebody else, it is even suggested that the trade card itself is a forgery.The trade card on the website of British Museum In popular culture James Figg's great-grandson appears as a central character in the Marc Olden novel Poe Must Die and appears alongside other historical figures including Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Dickens. Whilst he is a fictional adaption, Olden's character references the life and experiences of the real Figg.

The main thoroughfares are Interstate 395 (Shirley Highway) which divides the neighborhood into North and South Fairlington, State Route 7 (King Street) and State Route 402 (Quaker Lane). The neighborhood consists of primarily townhouse-type condominium apartments built in the 1940s as the largest housing project financed by the Defense Homes Corporation during World War II. Fairlington is listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and on the Virginia Landmarks Register. Name, boundaries, and geography Fairlington was originally called Seminary Heights but it was changed due to confusion with other nearby geographical features named for Alexandria's Virginia Theological Seminary including Seminary Drive, Seminary Road, and Seminary View, among others. A new name, Fairlington, was chosen combining the two counties in which the neighborhood was then located: Fairfax and Arlington. (The former Fairfax County section is now part of the City of Alexandria.) The neighborhood is wooded and sits on heights overlooking the Four Mile Run valley. It is bisected by I-395 into North and South Fairlington connected by the Fairlington Bridge (South Abingdon Street). History =Early history= Fairlington Entrance at 32nd Road South Upon the arrival of Europeans in the New World, the area that is now Fairlington was near a Necostin Indian village in the 17th century. In the early 18th century, a tract including Fairlington and extending to nearby Four Mile Run was granted under the headright system to William Struttfield, one of 48 original landowners in what is now Arlington County. By 1756, the land was owned by John Carlyle, a friend of future U.S. President George Washington, who was also the builder of Carlyle House in Alexandria. Carlyle and his heirs would possess the area of Fairlington for 150 years. Around 1770, Caryle began construction of a plantation and summer house near the current intersection of 30th Street South and South Columbus Street. The house was first called Torthorwald and later changed to Morven and stood until 1942.Both names reflect Carlyle's Scottish heritage. Torthorwald was a family property and Morven is a mythical land of the Gaels in an Ossian poem. One impetus for the change might have been that black residents in the area began to refer to Torthorwald as \\"T'otherworld\\" (i.e., the other world). (Noted in Richard Henry Spencer. [The Carlyle House and its Associations--Braddock's Headquarters-- Here the Colonial Governors met in Council, April, 1755.\\"] William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. Vol.18, No.1. (July 1909). p. 16.) Carlyle used his plantation as a stud farm and operated a grist mill downstream from Fairlington above what is now Arlandria. Following John Carlyle's death in 1780, the house passed to his nephew, Carlyle Fairfax Whiting. George Washington himself owned a portion of the land in what would become Fairlington, near the Abingdon Elementary School and South 28th Street after he bought two of the 48 Arlington land grants. Following the American Revolution, new federal district governed by Congress was created in 1790 and the area that is now Fairlington (except for part of the section now within Alexandria) was included within the original boundaries of the new District of Columbia, forming part of Alexandria County, D.C.. Congressional control began in 1801 and the area was no longer under Virginian jurisdiction.The base of one of the District of Columbia boundary stones is still in place near the intersection of King Street and South Wakefield Street. However, in 1846, the entire county was retroceded to Virginia and became Alexandria County, VA. =From Union occupation to World War II= With the secession of Virginia from the United States on 17 April 1861, Northern Virginia was quickly liberated by the United States government. A line of redoubts and breastworks above Four Mile Run was constructed to defend the main base of the occupying Army of the Potomac in Alexandria and the Fairlington area was the site of two of these. Fort Reynolds, a redoubt, was constructed in September 1861 to command the approach to Alexandria by way of the Four Mile Run valley. It had a perimeter of and emplacements for 12 guns and was located just northeast of what is now 31st Street South at South Woodrow Street. Battery Garesche at what is now South Abingdon Street at South 30th Road and was constructed late in 1861 to control the higher ground dominating Fort Reynolds, to the southeast. It had a perimeter of and emplacements for 8 guns. The area was never taken by Confederate forces and remained under US military control until 1870. Despite the military use of what is now Fairlington, the area retained a rural character; mostly wooded, with some small farms, into the 20th century. In 1879, the area of Fairlington was consolidated under Hawkins Smith who remodeled Morven and renamed it Hampton. His son, Hawkins Smith II, made Hampton a leading horse farm but sold it in 1926. It was subdivided with some of the land rented by sharecroppers. One cleared area in South Fairlington served as an airfield until the mid-1930s. In 1920, Alexandria County was renamed Arlington County to distinguish it from the neighboring independent City of Alexandria and in 1929, Alexandria annexed all of Arlington County south of Four Mile Run to the current boundary along Quaker Lane. =The creation of Fairlington= Fairlington Historical Marker At the time of the United States entry into World War II in December 1941, the Defense Homes Corporation (a component of the Federal Housing Administration) had purchased most of the area. The corporation was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 through the allocation of emergency funding and, by February 1942, it had assembled for construction of housing for civilian and military defense personnel to be called Seminary Heights. The site was only from the Pentagon which had begun construction in August 1941. As with nearby Parkfairfax, Alexandria, and several other sites throughout metropolitan Washington, the Corporation endeavored to quickly satisfy increased wartime demand for housing and, by the end of 1943, by which time the project was renamed Fairlington, there were almost 2,415 housing units completed. By 1945, there were 3,439 units when the project was completed at a cost of $35 million ($368 million in dollars). In 1947, the Defense Homes Corporation sold the property to Fairmac Realty Corporation, which operated Fairlington as rental apartments. The area surrounding Fairlington also began to urbanize with nearby Shirlington Shopping Center opening in 1945 and Bradlee Shopping Center in the 1950s. In 1952, the independent City of Alexandria annexed the small Fairfax County portion of Fairlington, rendering the name an anachronism. In 1966, a mutual agreement between Arlington and Alexandria adjusted the city- county boundary through North Fairlington that had followed the original District of Columbia-Virginia line. The new boundary followed the north and east sides of State Route 7 (King Street), 30th Street South, South Columbus Street, and 28th Street South. In 1954, the well-preserved Fort Reynolds was leveled to construct the Park Shirlington apartments. In 1967, as part of the conversion of Shirley Highway to interstate standards, a bridge connecting South Abingdon Street in North Fairlington and 34th Street South in South Fairlington was opened, directly connecting the two sections for the first time. =Fairlington as condominiums= By the late 1960s, Fairlington's owners, now Hartford Insurance, considered razing the apartments and constructing high-rise apartment buildings. Instead, it decided to convert the existing structures to condominium apartments in 1972. Virginia had only permitted condominium development since 1962 and Fairlington was the largest scale project ever undertaken to that date. Fairlington was sold to Chicago Bridge and Iron and operated by CBI-Fairmac and a five-year project to physically modify the apartments for their new use commenced. Common basement areas were divided between apartments and boiler houses were removed and replaced with recreation facilities. Beginning in South Fairlington, CBI- Fairmac converted the area into seven legal entities under the Virginia Horizontal Property Act. Six of the condominiums were in South Fairlington and the entirety of North Fairlington formed one condominium. The initial offerings sold for $19,000-$45,500 ($86,000-$203,000 in dollars) in 1972 and prices were increased for later sales with the final units sold in 1978. In 1979, Fairlington Elementary School was closed and the building became the Fairlington Community Center.Other Contributing Buildings, Fairlington Historic District, National Register of Historic Places In 1996, the value of Fairlington was assessed at $423,701,600 ($514,299,241 in dollars). Fairlington as a whole was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in December 1998 and the National Register of Historic Places in March 1999. =Historical marker= An Arlington County Office of Historic Preservation historical marker installed at the corner of Quaker Lane and South 32nd Street reads: :\\"Designed in the Colonial Revival style by Kenneth Franzheim and Alan B. Mills and constructed between 1942 and 1944, Fairlington is an early example of successful community planning and large-scale, publicly financed rental housing built for defense workers and their families during World War II. With 3,439 garden apartments, Fairlington was the largest project financed by Defense Homes Corporation (a component of the National Housing Agency) and the nation’s largest apartment complex at that time. The units were renovated and sold as condominiums between 1972 and 1977. The name Fairlington combines Fairfax and Arlington, the counties in which the project was located.\\" Civic organization Apartments in North Fairlington Fairlington is organized into seven, independent condominium associations sometimes called villages including Fairlington Arbor, Fairlington Commons, Fairlington Glen, Fairlington Green, Fairlington Meadows, and Fairlington Mews, all in South Fairlington, and Fairlington Villages in North Fairlington. There is a single civic association, the Fairlington Citizens Association, representing the community in local affairs and the Fairlington Historical Society promotes historical preservation. Physical environment =Layout= 1988 aerial photograph of Fairlington Fairlington's streets are all two lanes and they are neither on a grid with uniform city blocks nor in the suburban cul-de-sac style found in most American suburbs but are slightly winding and usually separated by the equivalent of two or more city blocks. Fairlington's apartment units are grouped in \\"courts,\\" usually three or four separate buildings of around 40-50 total units facing a parking lot (carpark). Most units are three levels (upstairs, ground level and basement) with front and back doors. Some units are two or three story walk-ups with units on a single floor. Prior to the condominium conversions, back doors opened to common areas with connecting sidewalks leading to back porches. Post-conversions, most units have a small courtyard off the back door, surrounded by a wooden fence. The common areas between the courts contain open areas for recreation. Originally the common areas included playgrounds and wading pools. The latter consisted of flat concrete squares with short concrete sides and a sprinkler in the center. These provided cooling and recreation in the summer when air conditioning was not widely available. With the conversion to condominiums, tennis, basketball courts, playgrounds, and swimming facilities replaced the original playgrounds and wading pools. Prior to the condominium conversions, each building had a common basement area, which could be reached from the basement of apartments which had basements, or from a stairway in buildings containing single-floor apartments. The common basement contained trashrooms and laundry facilities. Buildings with single-floor apartments also had storage units in the common basements. With the condominium conversions, the common areas were divided to become part of the basement areas of individual condominiums. Sidewalks (pavements) along the streets and in the common areas connect the neighborhood. Each condominium association in South Fairlington consists of around 15 courts. =Architecture= Fairlington's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places identifies 1024 historical buildings in Fairlington and 30 residential unit types and describes North and South Fairlington as follows: Townhouses in South Fairlington :In terms of style, materials and detailing, the two sections are very similar. All buildings are of the Colonial Revival style. Building heights range from 1½ to three stories. Gable roofs predominate, followed by hipped roofs, flat roofs, gambrel roofs, and a handful of mansard roofs. Most are slate. Walls primarily are brick, laid in five- or six-course American bond, although a few of the 1½-story buildings with steeply pitched gable roofs are of cut stone. Windows are six-over-six double-hung sash. Exterior doors are paneled, with or without lights. Front entrances are sheltered by porches or stoops. All of the one- story, one-bay porches feature hipped, shed or gable roofs supported by wooden Tuscan or Doric columns, square or turned wooden posts or brick piers. Front entrance stoops often are sheltered by bracketed canopies. Many buildings have nonfunctioning brick chimneys. Typical details include dentils and other decorative wood molding, stone window and door lintels, pilasters, sidelights, wheel and round windows, belt courses and inoperative shutters.From the Nomination to the National Register of Historic Places - Fairlington Historic District (.pdf file) - assembled by Gail H. Baker In journalist David Brinkley's 1988 Washington Goes to War, he mentions the area, describing life there in the summer of 1943 noting its lack of shopping and transportation options. However, \\"Fairlington at least had sturdy, well-designed housing (most of it still standing today and now expensive townhouses and condominiums).\\"Quoted in \\"A Brief History\\" from the Fairlington Villages Resident's Handbook Fairlington is listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places and, in 2002, the neighborhood was presented the \\"Test of Time\\" award by the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects, for the lasting value of its architectural design. Such listings and awards do not impose restrictions on property use which is the under the purview of the condominiums. Fairlington was the first large- scale apartment community to be considered for such designation and the campaign for listing was largely a volunteer effort. =Arboriculture= Fairlington's streets and common areas are heavily treed with oaks, maples, elms, and sycamores (planes). A Fairlington Notable Tree Walkhttp://www.fairlington.org/Smtown.htm showcases some of the more unusual trees in the area. Transportation =Roads= Fairlington Bridge (South Abingdon Street) over I-395 The controlled access Interstate 395 (Shirley Highway) divides Fairlington and is bridged by South Abingdon Street within the neighborhood but provides no direct access. State Route 7 (King Street) and State Route 402 (Quaker Lane) bound the neighborhood on the southwest and east respectively but are largely separated from it by chain link fencing with access only at street entrances. Although Fairlington's street names and addresses follow the rules of the grid-style Arlington County's street-naming system, the streets do not follow a grid but are also not the suburban cul-de- sac style found in most American suburbs. Intersections consist of both four- way stops and modern roundabouts (traffic circles).Fairlington's traffic circles follow modern roundabout rules with entering vehicles yielding and vehicles in the roundabout having priority over entering vehicles. Within Fairlington there are both bicycle lanes and an on-street bicycle route. =Buses= Several Metrobus routes traverse the neighborhood and adjacent roads provide additional Metrobus and Alexandria's DASH bus service. =Rail= Several Washington Metro stations are within of Fairlington and Metrobus and DASH directly connect the neighborhood with the King Street – Old Town Metro station in Alexandria and the Pentagon Metro station in Arlington. Alexandria Union Station provides Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express service to the area and is accessible by DASH from Fairlington. =Airports= Fairlington is located from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington County and from Washington Dulles International Airport in Sterling, Virginia. Recreation and commerce Fairlington Common Area The Fairlington Community Center, which was once an elementary school, is located at the northeast corner of 34th Street South and South Stafford Streets in South Fairlington. It provides space for a number of community and recreational activities. Utah Field Park and Abingdon Elementary School also have space for public recreation. Each condominium association within Fairlington also maintains its own system of swimming pools and tennis and basketball courts for its own residents. Within the confines of Fairlington, there are several commercial buildings that house local businesses such as health care service providers (dentist, physical therapy, chiropractic, etc.) and business offices (real estate, law, patent services, etc.) that cater to local residents and the broader community. Adjacent to Fairlington, The Village at Shirlington, provides restaurants, stores (shops), bars (pubs), a theater (theatre), a cinema, and the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail trailhead within walking distance for North Fairlington residents. South Fairlington residents are connected to Shirlington by a pedestrian walkway that crosses the Shirlington Circle interchange with I-395. The Fort Ward Museum and Historic Site, the Virginia Theological Seminary, both in Alexandria, are a short distance from South Fairlington. Alexandria's Bradlee and Fairlington shopping centers are adjacent to South Fairlington. Education The public Abingdon Elementary School is on 30th Road South in North Fairlington and serves all of Fairlington as do Gunston Middle School and Wakefield High School. The Arlington County Department of Parks, Recreation & Cultural Resources provides continuing education at the Fairlington Community Center. The Community Center began as the Fairlington Elementary School in 1940 and was converted into a community center in 1979. County and state services Fairlington is in the 3rd District of the Arlington County Police Department which cooperates with the Fairlington Citizens Association. Arlington Fire Station No. 7 of the Arlington County Fire Department housing Engine 107, located at is located on South Abingdon Street in North Fairlington. The Arlington County office of the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service is located in the Fairlington Community Center. All of Fairlington, including the Alexandria portion, is in the 22206 ZIP code area and is served by the United States Postal Service's Shirlington Annex Post Office although the Parkfairfax Post Office in Alexandria is closer to most of Fairlington.

In 1811 he captured the fortress of Chanderi on the eastern border of Sindhia's kingdom from the Bundela Rajput rulers. He led Sindhia's forces against British during the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818), and captured the fortress of Garha Kota near Sagar in 1817. In 1841, Jean Baptiste Filose, Colonel and Sardar in the services of Maharaja Scindia, permitted a Catholic school to be established in his property at Jamuna Bagh, Agra. A few years later, he made a donation of one lakh rupees, then a fabulous amount, for the construction of a new Catholic school for boys in Agra. The foundation stone was laid in 1846 by Major O'Gorman of the East India Company. This school was named St. Peter's College and continues today in Agra.

According to the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, her name means [Goddess] of Ṣarpān, an otherwise unknown village outside of Babylon.'Chicago Assyrian Dictionary Ṣ, 1961, p. 112. Others explain her name as meaning \\"the shining one\\", and she is sometimes associated with the planet Venus. By a play on words her name was interpreted as zēr- bānītu, or \\"creatress of seed\\", and is thereby associated with the goddess Aruru, who, according to Babylonian myth, created mankind. Helmer Ringgren, (1974) Religions of The Ancient Near East, Translated by John Sturdy, The Westminster Press, p. 67. In the documentation available to modern scholars, Ṣarpānītu only exists as a consort to her husband, without personality of her own. Her cult was located in Esagila, the great temple of Marduk in Babylon, where their divine marriage was celebrated during the great akītu ritual at the New Year. Ṣarpānītu also appears in a text given the title Love Lyrics, in which she confronts Marduk for chasing the goddess Ishtar through the streets of Babylon. as well as the article on Mariage sacré (Sacred marriage) in the same dictionary, p. 509. Other sources describe Ishtar as the wife of Marduk. Sarpanit was used as a theophoric element in women's names, as was an archaic form of the name, Erua. She was worshipped via the rising moon, and was often depicted as being pregnant. The Theology of Priesthood, a book to prepare seminary students for a career as a Catholic priest, speculates whether Sarpanit may be the same as Gamsu, Ishtar, and/or Bêlit.

Born in 1950 in Pinsk, Belarus, Izya moved to the United States in 1994 and quickly became known in the New York and Baltimore art circles for his unique style and ability to express himself through his work. Through his art, Izya Shlosberg attempts to teach others about the world and its many unknowns. With his complex, three-dimensional works, Shlosberg encourages those who view them \\"to think outside the box and then outside of that box\\". In 1999, Izya Shlosberg began to write novels, mostly describing thoughts behind his philosophical concepts. Some of the topics of interest to him included communications and understanding between living and \\"accepted as living\\" things, combination of mechanical and creative processes, a two way communication between the creator and his product, and others. When he began writing, Shlosberg created the idea that modern art pieces represent a specific complex product, rather than paintings. Specifically, he combined art and literature into one whole piece that tells a story. According to him, this inspiration came from him after he read history of art, referring to many well-known artists as writers. Shlosberg's paintings don't illustrate what his novels say and his novels don't repeat the story of his paintings. Although both objects are independent of one another, the combination of them creates a multidimensional, emotional, complex product. According to him, not only does this combination cause complex visual effects, but also creative ones. In 2002 he created an international club of multi-talented people, Shiva-club, which includes about 100 artists, authors, musicians, including such as artists as E. Zolotnitsky, D. Gerrman, G. Gurvich (USA), S. Zhilevich (Belarus), E. Berezin, A. Cherkasov (Russia), S. Livni (Israel), etc.), authors (P. Amnuel (Israel), M. Gelprin (USA), J. Gavrilenko, M. Drobkov (Russia), V.

Born in Rome into a family of artists (his father Francesco Trombadori was a painter) Trombadori lived a happy life in the Villa Strohl-Fern studio-home of his city, coming into contact with numerous intellectuals of the era. An intimate friend of Renato Guttuso and Corrado Cagli, he collaborated with them in his youth on a series of important magazines, including La Ruota, Primato, Città, Corrente and Cinema. Between the years of 1937 and 1940 he participated in a secret propaganda effort to convince Italian youth to abandon fascism. He was caught in 1941 and brought in front of the Special Tribunal, where he was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment. Due to his family’s celebrity, Benito Mussolini offered him absolution in return for a public apology and admission of tort. Trombadori refused and was consequentially jailed. On July, 1943 he escaped from prison and in collaboration with Giorgio Amendola, he attempted to defend Rome from the Nazis and was subsequently arrested by the Germans on February, 1944. He managed to escape in August of the same year. Soon after the Liberation of Rome he organized an exhibition titled “L’arte contro la barbarie [Art against barbarism]”. In 1945 he presented Renato Guttuso’s album of drawings, Gott mit unshttp://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid;=1234&page;=1&sole;=y&collab;=y&attr;=y&sort;=default&tabview;=bio and in the same year helped Roberto Rossellini and Carlo Lizzani in filming the masterpiece Roma, città aperta (Rome, Open City). Trombadori was an influential member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), becoming a member of its Central Committee. In 1967 he was envoyee to Vietnam for the party's journal, L'Unità. He collaborated also with Rinascita. Trombadori was elected four times in the Italian Chamber of Deputies for PCI, but in 1993 he declared himself \\"No more a Communist\\" and a voter of the Italian Socialist Party. Amongst his most important critical contributions were his introductions to the retrospective publications Donghi (Antonio Donghi) and Scipione (Gino Bonichi; both of 1985); Scuola romana (1986) and Roma appena ieri (Rome Just Yesterday) (1987). He also served as editor of the catalogue of artworks at Palazzo Montecitorio, the seat of the Chamber of Deputies. He married Fulvia Trozzi, daughter of the famous lawyer and socialist parliamentary Mario Trozzi and had two children: Duccio and Lucilla, and later have three granddaughters, Cecilia (1976), Hortense (1979) and Charlotte (1991).

It was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history and the largest on UK soil. Between 3,500 and 4,000 tonnes of ordnance exploded, mostly high explosives. The explosion crater with a depth of and across is still visible just south of Fauld, to the east of Hanbury, Staffordshire. It is now known as the Hanbury Crater. A nearby reservoir containing 450,000 cubic metres of water was obliterated in the incident, along with several buildings including a complete farm. Flooding caused by the destruction of the reservoir added to the damage directly caused by the explosion.Reed, John, (1977). \\"Largest Wartime Explosions: 21 Maintenance Unit, RAF Fauld, Staff. November 27, 1944\\", After the Battle, 18, pp. 35–40. . The exact death toll is uncertain; it is believed that about 70 people died in the explosion and the resulting flood. Cause Bombs being stacked in one of the tunnels at RAF Fauld The cause of the disaster was not made clear at the time. There had been staff shortages, a management position had remained empty for a year, and 189 inexperienced Italian POWs were working in the mines at the time of the accident. In 1974, it was announced that the cause of the explosion was probably a site worker removing a detonator from a live bomb using a brass chisel rather than a wooden batten. An eyewitness testified that he had seen a worker using brass chisels in contravention of the strict regulations in force. Effects No. 21 Maintenance Unit RAF Bomb Storage dump consisted of old gypsum mine workings which had been made into storage for a variety of ordnance; in addition to shells and bombs, the specifications included several types of weapons and up to 500 million rounds of small arms ammunition. Up to 4,000 tonnes exploded, including 3,500 tonnes of bombs packed with high explosives. At 11:15 hours on 27 November 1944, two huge explosions took place at the dump. Eyewitnesses reported seeing two distinct columns of black smoke in the form of a mushroom cloud ascending several thousand feet, and a blaze at the foot of the column. According to the commanding officer of 21 M.U., Group Captain Storrar, an open dump of incendiary bombs caught fire and it was allowed to burn itself out without damage or casualties. Property was damaged within a radius of mile of the crater.Ministry of Home Security report File RE. 5/5i region IX. Debris and damage occurred to all property within a circle extending for . Upper Castle Hayes Farm completely disappeared and Messrs. Peter Ford's lime and gypsum works to the north of the village and Purse cottages were completely demolished. The lime works was destroyed by the flooding after the destruction of the reservoir dam. Hanbury Fields Farm, Hare Holes Farm and also Croft Farm with adjacent cottages were all extensively damaged. Debris also damaged Hanbury village. The crater was by in length and deep, covering 12 acres. Approximately one third of the RAF dump exploded, an area of , but barriers of rock pillars between No. 3 and No. 4 sections held and prevented the other munition storage areas from exploding in a chain reaction. Casualties At the time, there was no careful tally of the number of workers at the facility. So, while the exact death toll is uncertain, it appears that about 70 people died in the explosion. The official report said that 90 were killed, missing or injured,File no RE5/5 region IX, now held by The National Archives as AIR 17/10 including: * 26 killed or missing at the RAF dump—divided between RAF personnel, civilian workers and some Italian prisoners of war who were working there—5 of whom were gassed by toxic fumes; also 10 severely injured. Six are buried in military graves. * 37 killed (drowned) or missing at Peter Ford & Sons gypsum mine and plaster mill, and surrounding countryside; also 12 injured. * Approximately 7 farm workers at the nearby Upper Castle Hayes Farm. * One diver was killed during search and rescue operations. Two hundred cattle were also killed by the explosion. Some live cattle were removed from the vicinity but were dead the following morning. Aftermath Memorial to the victims at the National Memorial Arboretum gives the number of victims as 70 A relief fund organised by the local people made payments to victims and their families until 1959. Much of the storage facility was annihilated by the explosion, but the site itself continued to be used by the RAF for munitions storage until 1966, when No. 21 Maintenance Unit was disbanded. Following France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military structure in 1966, the site was used by the US Army between 1967 and 1973 to store US ammunition previously stored in France. By 1979 the site was fenced off and the area is now covered with over 150 species of trees and wildlife. Access is restricted as a significant amount of explosives are still buried deep in the site; the UK government has deemed their removal too expensive to be feasible. On 13 September 1990, 46 years after the initial incident, it was announced that a memorial stone was to be built to commemorate those who died, to be paid for by the public because Hanbury Parish Council did not have the necessary funds. The stone used for the memorial was donated by the Italian government and flown to the United Kingdom on an RAF plane. It was unveiled on 25 November 1990. A second memorial was dedicated on the 70th anniversary of the explosion, 27 November 2014. A tourist trail leads to the crater from the Cock Inn pub in Hanbury, which was damaged by debris from the explosion.

The Incas inherited an architectural legacy from Tiwanaku, founded in the 2nd century B.C.E. in present-day Bolivia. A core characteristic of the architectural style was to use the topography and existing materials of the land as part of the design. The capital of the Inca empire, Cuzco, still contains many fine examples of Inca architecture, although many walls of Inca masonry have been incorporated into Spanish Colonial structures. The famous royal estate of Machu Picchu (Machu Pikchu) is a surviving example of Inca architecture. Other significant sites include Sacsayhuamán and Ollantaytambo. The Incas also developed an extensive road system spanning most of the western length of the continent and placed their distinctive architecture along the way, thereby visually asserting their imperial rule along the frontier.  Characteristics  Inca buildings were made out of fieldstones or semi-worked stone blocks and dirt set in mortar; adobe walls were also quite common, usually laid over stone foundations.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 11–12. The material used in the Inca buildings depended on the region, for instance, in the coast they used large rectangular adobe blocks while in the Andes they used local stones.Vergara, Teresa, “Arte y Cultura del Tahuantinsuyo”, p.317 The most common shape in Inca architecture was the rectangular building without any internal walls and roofed with wooden beams and thatch.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 5–6. There were several variations of this basic design, including gabled roofs, rooms with one or two of the long sides opened and rooms that shared a long wall.Hyslop, inca settlement, p. 6. Rectangular buildings were used for quite different functions in almost all Inca buildings, from humble houses to palaces and temples.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, p. 134. Even so, there are some examples of curved walls on Inca buildings, mostly in regions outside the central area of Peru.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 7–8. Two-story buildings were infrequent; when they were built the second floor was accessed from the outside via a stairway or high terrain rather than from the first floor.Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 8. Wall apertures, including doors, niches and windows, usually had a trapezoidal shape; they could be fitted with double or triple jambs as a form of ornamentation.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 9–10. Other kinds of decoration were scarce; some walls were painted or adorned with metal plaques, in rare cases walls were sculpted with small animals or geometric patterns.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 10–11. Twelve-angled stone in the Hatun Rumiyoc street of Cusco, is an example of Inca masonry The most common composite form in Inca architecture was the kancha, a rectangular enclosure housing three or more rectangular buildings placed symmetrically around a central courtyard.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 16–17. Kancha units served widely different purposes as they formed the basis of simple dwellings as well as of temples and palaces; furthermore, several kancha could be grouped together to form blocks in Inca settlements.Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 17. A testimony of the importance of these compounds in Inca architecture is that the central part of the Inca capital of Cusco consisted of large kancha, including Qurikancha and the Inca palaces.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, pp. 181, 185. The best preserved examples of kancha are found at Ollantaytambo, an Inca settlement located along the Urubamba River.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, p. 187. Inca architecture is widely known for its fine masonry, which features precisely cut and shaped stones closely fitted without mortar (\\"dry\\").Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 12. However, despite this fame, most Inca buildings were actually made out of fieldstone and adobe as described above.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 211. In the 1940s, American archaeologist John H. Rowe classified Inca fine masonry in two types: coursed, which features rectangular shaped stones, and polygonal, which features blocks of irregular shape.Rowe, An introduction, pp. 24–26. Forty years later, Peruvian architect Santiago Agurto established four subtypes by dividing the categories identified by Rowe:Agurto, Estudios acerca, pp. 144–175. * Cellular polygonal masonry: with small blocks * Ashlar polygonal masonry: with very large stones * Encased coursed masonry: in which stone blocks are not aligned * Sedimentary coursed masonry: in which stones are laid out in horizontal rows (i.e., ashlars) The first two types were used on important buildings or perimeter walls while the last two were employed mostly on terrace walls and river canalization.Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 15. Ashlar polygonal masonry at Sacsayhuamán According to Graziano Gasparini and Luise Margolies, Inca stonemasonry was inspired by the architecture of Tiwanaku, an archaeological site in modern Bolivia built several centuries before the Inca Empire.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, p. 25. They argue that according to ethnohistorical accounts the Incas were impressed by these monuments and employed large numbers of stoneworkers from nearby regions in the construction of their own buildings.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, pp. 78. In addition to these references, they also identified some formal similarities between Tiwanaku and Inca architecture including the use of cut and polished stone blocks, as well as of double jambs.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca architecture, pp. 12–13. A problem with this hypothesis is the question of how was expertise preserved in the three hundred years between the collapse of Tiwanaku and the appearance of the Inca Empire and its architecture. As a solution, John Hyslop has argued that the Tiahuanaco stonemasonry tradition was preserved in the Lake Titicaca region in sites such as Tanka Tanka, which features walls resembling Inca polygonal masonry.Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 23. A second major influence on Inca architecture came from the Wari culture, a civilization contemporary to Tiwanaku. According to Ann Kendall, the Huari introduced their tradition of building rectangular enclosures in the Cusco region, which formed a model for the development of the Inca kancha.Kendall, Aspects of Inca architecture, p. 352. There is evidence that such traditions were preserved in the Cusco region after the decline of the Wari as is attested by the enclosures found at sites such as Choquequirao (Chuqi K'iraw), 28 kilometers southeast of the Inca capital.Hyslop, Inka settlement, p. 20.  Masonry and construction methods  Inca wall in Cuzco Digital reconstruction of original Inca painting on Room 42 wall, Tambo Colorado; this late Inca period fortress/palace is still largely intact despite being constructed of adobe and located in an earthquake-prone area of Peru. Remaining traces of the original paint guided this 2005 reconstruction. Laser scan data taken from a CyArk/University of California research partnership Water engineer Ken Wright estimates that 60 percent of the Inca construction effort was underground. The Inca built their cities with locally available materials, usually including limestone or granite. To cut these hard rocks the Inca used stone, bronze or copper tools, usually splitting the stones along the natural fracture lines. Without the wheel the stones were rolled up with wood beams on earth ramps. Extraordinary manpower would have been necessary. The Inca Empire employed a system of tribute to the Inca government in the form of labor, called Mit'a that required all males between 15-50 to work on large public construction projects. Hyslop comments that the 'secret' to the production of fine Inca masonry “…was the social organization necessary to maintain the great numbers of people creating such energy-consuming monuments.” It is speculated that the stones were swung into place using friction to create perfectly convex and concave sides. Visible marks of facture like stone bosses were made using rope; these elements demonstrated the artistic value of labor and the power of Inca rule. Usually the walls of Incan buildings were slightly inclined inside and the corners were rounded. This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a peerless seismic resistance thanks to high static and dynamic steadiness, absence of resonant frequencies and stress concentration points. During an earthquake with a small or moderate magnitude, masonry was stable, and during a strong earthquake stone blocks were “ dancing ” near their normal positions and lay down exactly in right order after an earthquake. Another building method was called \\"pillow-faced\\" architecture. The Incas would sand large, finely shaped stones which they would fit together in jigsaw like patterns. Pillow-faced architecture was typically used for temples and royal places like Machu Picchu. Ashlar masonry was used in the most sacred, elite Inca structure; for example, the Acllawasi (\\"House of the Chosen Woman\\"), the Coricancha (\\"Golden Enclosure\\") in Cuzco, and the Sun Temple at Machu Picchu. Thus it seems that ashlar may have been more greatly valued by the Inca, perhaps considered more difficult than polygonal (\\"pillow- faced\\") masonry. Though polygonal masonry may be aesthetically more impressive, the facture of ashlar masonry tends to be unforgiving to mistakes; if a corner is broken in the process it can be reshaped to fit into the mosaic of polygonal masonry whereas you cannot recover a damaged rock in ashlar masonry.  Symbolism and patronage  = Aesthetics: Combining the Built and Natural Environments = Inca architecture is strongly characterized by its use of the natural environment. The Inca managed to seamlessly merge their architecture into the surrounding land and its specificities. At its peak, the Inca Empire spanned from Ecuador to Chile. Yet despite geographic variances, Inca architecture remained consistent in its ability to visually blend the built and natural environment. In particular, Inca walls practiced mortarless masonry and used partially worked, irregularly shaped rocks to complement the organic qualities and diversity of the natural environment. Through the dry fitted masonry techniques of caninacukpirca, the Incas shaped their stone to conceal natural outcrops, fit tight crevices, and ultimately incorporate the landscape into their infrastructure. The Inca also used natural bedrock as their structural foundations (to help keep the buildings stable). This pragmatically stabilized their structures built in the Andes mountain range of South America, while aesthetically disguising the boundaries between mountain and edifice. In combination, the diversity of stone shape, materiality, and facture all furthered the naturalistic illusion of the Inca's built environment. = Politics: Expansionist and Subservient Ideologies = Inca employment and integration of the natural environment into their architecture played an essential role in their program of civilizational expansion and cultural imperialism. Patronage of powerful elites and rulers of the Inca empire was a major impetus behind the construction of Inca structures, and much of the remaining architecture we see today was most likely royal estates or mobile capitals for Sapa Inca to inhabit. The Sapa Inca naturalized and asserted their political rule through their palaces' aesthetic appeal to a reciprocal relationship between their imperialism and the earth itself. The blended, architectural aesthetic colored their political expansion in a sense of inseparable, timeless, and spiritual authority. For example, in the royal estate of Chinchero, the Incas adapted their large-scale earthwork and massive stone construction to the land's dramatically steep valley in order to create intense, visual drama. Similarly to the architecture of other mountainous Inca citadels, such as Machu Picchu, the Chinchero estate's dynamic construction into the severe landscape demonstrated the raw, physical power of the Incas, and projected an authoritative aura for those who approached.

He was a native of Sussex County, Delaware and the son of U.S. Representative Caleb R. Layton.  Background  Layton studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where he also pitched for the baseball team. Following graduation from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and service in the offices of Ward & Gray in Wilmington, Layton was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1903. Layton then practiced law in Wilmington until 1915, when he returned to Georgetown to practice until his election as attorney general and later elevation to the Supreme Court.  Service for the Supreme Court  Two weeks after the expiration of the second term of James Pennewill, the previous Chief Justice, Governor C. Douglass Buck announced the appointment of Daniel J. Layton to replace him. Having been elected attorney general the previous November, and after having served in office for only six months, Layton resigned from that position to become chief justice. Governor Buck reappointed Josiah O. Wolcott as chancellor, as well as William Watson Harrington and Charles S. Richards as associate justices of the Supreme Court. In addition to these associate justices, Layton's colleagues in the law courts during his tenure as chief justice also included Richard S. Rodney, David J. Reinhardt, and Charles L. Terry. The resident judge of New Castle County, David J. Reinhardt, died in 1935 after two years of service and was replaced Frank L. Speakman. During Layton's 12 years as chief justice he wrote 221 of the 511 opinions produced by Delaware's law courts, including 49 of the 106 opinions issued by the Supreme Court. One of Layton's landmark decisions was Guth v. Loft in 1939. In this case Layton defined the relationship between corporate opportunities and the duty of loyalty for Delaware corporations. It was notable in its deviation from the 200 year precedent from Keech v. Sandford that a fiduciary should leave open no possibility of conflict of interest between his private dealings and the job he is entrusted to do. Another of Layton's landmark decisions was Bovay v. H.M. Byllesby & Co. in 1944, which reversed the chancellor's previous dismissal of a suit for an accounting and finding the complaint to state a claim for fraud and unfair dealing against corporate officers and directors for breach of trust, not \\"mere torts.\\" As William Prickett, Sr. stated at the proceedings in memory of Chief Justice Layton: \\"The Chief Justice wrote English, not a jargon of legalese. No \\"saids\\", \\"to-wits\\", \\"hereinaboves\\", or \\"aforementioneds\\" appear in any of his opinions. His language was striking in its clarity and in its picturesqueness.\\" Unquestionably, Chief Justice Layton was a brilliant judge with a genius for defining fundamental concepts in corporate law. But, unfortunately his aggressive domination of a proceeding at oral argument frequently silenced even his strong-willed colleagues. Worse still, Layton's air of apparent hostility extended to the lawyers arguing before him, whom he would repeatedly challenge in a combative manner. Judge Collins J. Seitz recalls: \\"It's an old story in the law heard everywhere about the judge who kept interrupting the lawyer who was arguing his case. Finally, the lawyer got irritated, and said, 'Your Honor, I don’t mind your interrupting me, but I hope you win it for me!\\"'  Failed renomination  Indeed, as an eminent lawyer remembers, Chief Justice Layton seemed to feel the \\"need to destroy you if he didn't agree with you.\\" As a consequence, and despite his achievements, Layton failed to be reappointed in 1945 in one of the most painful episodes in Delaware judicial history. Governor Walter W. Bacon, a Republican, nominated Layton and Judge Charles S. Richards, both well-known Republicans, to succeed themselves as chief justice and associate justice respectively, but the Delaware Senate, a majority of whom were also Republicans, twice rejected both nominees. It was generally said that the opposition to Layton was mounted by Hugh M. Morris, a former United States District Court judge but then a practicing attorney in Wilmington, and joined in by certain Sussex County lawyers who thought they had suffered too long under Layton's wrath in the courtroom. In a compromise arrangement. The Governor of Delaware withdrew Layton's name and nominated Judge Richards to be the new chief justice. He was confirmed. The governor then appointed James B. Carey of Georgetown to be the resident judge for Sussex County, succeeding Judge Richards.  Aftermath  But the political and judicial fallout of Layton's failed renomination continued. In 1946 the term of Judge Richard S. Rodney ended. Having completed twenty-four years of service as Judge of the Superior Court and as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, Rodney was universally acknowledged to be one of the most respected and loved judges in Delaware history. Governor Bacon then took his revenge for the Senate's rejection of Layton, making Rodney the victim. Bacon let it be known that, notwithstanding the fact that the constitution required the appointment of a Democrat, under no circumstances would he reappoint Democrat Rodney. In January 1946 Governor Bacon nominated Vice-Chancellor George Burton Pearson, Jr. to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the expiration of Judge Rodney's term of office. Pearson, a close friend and admirer of Judge Rodney, had supported his candidacy for reappointment and, in the end, he accepted the governor's offer only when it became certain that Judge Rodney would not be reappointed. Judge Rodney returned briefly to private practice before receiving an appointment to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in 1946. He remained on that court until his death in 1963 and never failed to serve with wisdom and grace. While the Layton years on the Supreme Court were often difficult and controversial for the bar, the period was one of outstanding growth for Delaware corporate law. Much of this growth was due not only to the judicial skill of Chancellor Wolcott but also to the brilliance and productive work of Chief Justice Layton. It is the judicial work product of luminaries like Curtis, Wolcott and Layton that provides the enduring legal and moral basis for much of what is right with the body of Delaware decisional law. He is interred at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. References * Horsey, Henry R. & Duffy, William . \\"The 'Leftover Judge' System\\".

The principal objective is to reduce the risks, including prevention or mitigation of cyber-attacks. These published materials consist of collections of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies. History Cybersecurity standards have existed over several decades as users and providers have collaborated in many domestic and international forums to effect the necessary capabilities, policies, and practices - generally emerging from work at the Stanford Consortium for Research on Information Security and Policy in the 1990s.http://fsi.stanford.edu/research/consortium_for_research_on_information_security_and_policy A 2016 US security framework adoption study reported that 70% of the surveyed organizations the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as the most popular best practice for Information Technology (IT) computer security, but many note that it requires significant investment. Cross-border, cyber-exfiltration operations by law enforcement agencies to counter international criminal activities on the dark web raise complex jurisdictional questions that remain, to some extent, unanswered. Tensions between domestic law enforcement efforts to conduct cross-border cyber-exfiltration operations and international jurisdiction are likely to continue to provide improved cybersecurity norms.  Standards  The subsections below detail the most commonly used standards. = ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 = ISO/IEC 27001, part of the growing ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, is an information security management system (ISMS) standard, of which the last revision was published in October 2013 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Its full name is ISO/IEC 27001:2013 – Information technology – Security techniques – Information security management systems – Requirements. ISO/IEC 27001 formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under explicit management control. ISO/IEC 27002 incorporates mainly part 1 of the BS 7799 good security management practice standard. The latest versions of BS 7799 is BS 7799-3. Sometimes ISO/IEC 27002 is therefore referred to as ISO 17799 or BS 7799 part 1 and sometimes it refers to part 1 and part 7\\\\. BS 7799 part 1 provides an outline or good practice guide for cybersecurity management; whereas BS 7799 part 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 are normative and therefore provide a framework for certification. ISO/IEC 27002 is a high level guide to cybersecurity. It is most beneficial as explanatory guidance for the management of an organisation to obtain certification to the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. The certification once obtained lasts three years. Depending on the auditing organisation, no or some intermediate audits may be carried out during the three years. ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS) replaces BS 7799 part 2, but since it is backward compatible any organization working toward BS 7799 part 2 can easily transition to the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process. There is also a transitional audit available to make it easier once an organization is BS 7799 part 2-certified for the organization to become ISO/IEC 27001-certified. ISO/IEC 27002 provides best practice recommendations on information security management for use by those responsible for initiating, implementing or maintaining information security management systems (ISMS). It states the information security systems required to implement ISO/IEC 27002 control objectives. Without ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002 control objectives are ineffective. ISO/IEC 27002 controls objectives are incorporated into ISO 27001 in Annex A. ISO/IEC 21827 (SSE-CMM – ISO/IEC 21827) is an International Standard based on the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) that can measure the maturity of ISO controls objectives. =NERC= An initial attempt to create information security standards for the electrical power industry was created by NERC in 2003 and was known as NERC CSS (Cyber Security Standards).Symantec Control Compliance Suite - NERC and FERC Regulation Subsection: History of NERC Standards Subsequent to the CSS guidelines, NERC evolved and enhanced those requirements. The most widely recognized modern NERC security standard is NERC 1300, which is a modification/update of NERC 1200. The newest version of NERC 1300 is called CIP-002-3 through CIP-009-3 (CIP=Critical Infrastructure Protection). These standards are used to secure bulk electric systems although NERC has created standards within other areas. The bulk electric system standards also provide network security administration while still supporting best-practice industry processes. =NIST= # The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) \\"provides a high level taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes.\\" It is intended to help private sector organizations that provide critical infrastructure with guidance on how to protect it, along with relevant protections for privacy and civil liberties. # Special publication 800-12 provides a broad overview of computer security and control areas. It also emphasizes the importance of the security controls and ways to implement them. Initially this document was aimed at the federal government although most practices in this document can be applied to the private sector as well. Specifically it was written for those people in the federal government responsible for handling sensitive systems. # Special publication 800-14 describes common security principles that are used. It provides a high level description of what should be incorporated within a computer security policy. It describes what can be done to improve existing security as well as how to develop a new security practice. Eight principles and fourteen practices are described within this document. # Special publication 800-26 provides advice on how to manage IT security. Superseded by NIST SP 800-53 rev3. This document emphasizes the importance of self assessments as well as risk assessments. # Special publication 800-37, updated in 2010 provides a new risk approach: \\"Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems\\" # Special publication 800-53 rev4, \\"Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations\\", Published April 2013 updated to include updates as of January 15, 2014, specifically addresses the 194 security controls that are applied to a system to make it \\"more secure\\". # Special publication 800-63-3, \\"Digital Identity Guidelines\\", Published June 2017 updated to include updates as of December 1, 2017, provides guidelines for implementing digital identity services, including identity proofing, registration, and authentication of users. # Special Publication 800-82, Revision 2, \\"Guide to Industrial Control System (ICS) Security\\", revised May 2015, describes how to secure multiple types of Industrial Control Systems against cyber attacks while considering the performance, reliability and safety requirements specific to ICS. =ISO 15408= This standard develops what is called the “Common Criteria”. It allows many different software and hardware products to be integrated and tested in a secure way. =ANSI/ISA 62443 (Formerly ISA-99)= ANSI/ISA 62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created by the International Society for Automation (ISA) and publicly released as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443 series. ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC as input to the IEC 62443 series of international standards following the IEC standards development process. Planned and published ISA62443 work products for IACS Security. All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called General, Policies and Procedures, System and Component.More information about the activities and plans of the ISA99 committee is available on the committee Wiki site () # The first (top) category includes foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. # The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program. # The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model. # The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products.  The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) Conformity Assessment Program  Established in 2007, The International Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ANSI/ISA 62443 standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) automation, control systems, and IOT devices , addressing securing the control systems supply chain. ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the ANSI/ISA 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure working groups have included subject matter experts from traditional process industries and building management system suppliers and asset owners. The ISASecure scheme requires that all products are properly tested during the supplier development process in conformance to ANSI/ISA 62443-4-1. exida from the United States was the first certification body accredited for the ISASecure scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center – Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and TÜV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS). Five additional certification bodies are being accredited in 2019 including TÜV SÜD. Two COm,TS product certifications are available under the ISASecure® brand: ISASecure-CSA (Component Security Assurance) certifying automation products to the IEC 62443-4-1 / IEC 62443-4-2 cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying systems to the IEC 62443-3-3 standard. A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies automation systems development organizations to the IEC 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard. =ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation= The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB, DAkkS, Singapore Accreditation Council, and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB). The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools. Through mutual recognition arrangements with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized. = IEC 62443 = The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are multi- industry standards listing cybersecurity protection methods and techniques. These documents are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals and other inputs are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted. The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees. To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. IEC 62443 Certification Programs IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies. Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures which describes their test methods, surveillance audit policy, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. Cybersecurity certification programs for IEC 62443 standards are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, SGS-TÜV Saar, TÜV Nord, TÜV Rheinland, TÜV Sud, UL and CertX. In the automation system market space most cybersecurity certifications have been done by exida.https://www.isasecure.org/en-US/End-Users/Certified-Components =Global Accreditation and Recognition= A global infrastructure has been established to ensure consistent evaluation per these standards. Impartial third party organizations called Certification Bodies (CB) are accredited to operate ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs...

As of 2010, it serves 1512 students in grades 9-12. It is the second oldest high school of the DeKalb County School District, having opened in 1917. Chamblee is a charter school and therefore accepts students from all of Dekalb County as well as from its local district. Chamblee was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 1996 and is one of 27% of schools in Dekalb to make the AYP of the No Child Left Behind Act. CHS was ranked #215 of the 1500 best public high schools by Newsweek magazine. Its students' SAT scores are ranked first in Dekalb County and sixth in the state. When adjusted for differences in demographics, Chamblee High School has the highest SAT scores of all Atlanta-metro schools (including Cobb, Gwinnett, and Forsyth). Its 84th percentile ranking is superior to Walton (73rd percentile) and other suburban counterparts. The student body also has one of the highest acceptance rates to tier 1 colleges and universities in the state of Georgia. The school offers a variety of extracurricular activities, courses, and sports. There are elective performing art classes which are bolstered by performances. CCHS offers 32 AP courses, the most of any high school in Dekalb County, and was named an AP Honor School in 2011 for every category in which it was eligible. History Graduation Day, 2010 *Prior to 1917: Chamblee High School and Chamblee Elementary School were housed in a single building on the present site of the First Baptist Church of Chamblee. *1917: DeKalb County authorized the purchase of land for the high school on Chamblee Dunwoody road. Construction began. *1919: The first classes were held in the partially completed school. *1922: M.E. \\"Prof\\" Smith was named principal. He served for 35 years. *1924: Ten classrooms and DeKalb County's first gymnasium were added to the campus. *1928: A home economics building was added. *1934: Depression-era WPA funding allowed Chamblee High School to add eight new classrooms, a new gymnasium, a canning plant, and a machine shop. The school became the first in DeKalb County to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. *December 8, 1941: The entire campus burned to the ground. Classes were relocated to area hospitals and Baptist and Methodist churches. *December 1942: The high school was rebuilt and classes resumed on campus. *1950: A lighted general athletic field was built for football and baseball games. *1962: North DeKalb Stadium opened next door to Chamblee High School. *1964: The school was remodeled, adding 19 classrooms and five laboratories. *1966: The new basketball gymnasium, chorus rooms, band rooms, and swimming pool were added. *1970: The old basketball gymnasium and home economics building were demolished. A new cafeteria was built on the site. *1973: The old 1942 classrooms were demolished and a new administration building and library were built. *1991: The first magnet class entered Chamblee High School. *1994: Chamblee High was named a National School of Excellence. *2001: Chamblee High was named a State School of Excellence. *2001: Chamblee High became a charter school. *2011: Senior and Sophomore halls were torn down for the rebuilding of the new school. *December 20, 2013: Demolition of the remaining old building started. *January 7, 2014: The new academic building held its first day of school. Facility Chamblee High School's main building was last renovated in 1971 and is being pushed fifty percent beyond maximum capacity. In the 2010-2011 school year, an additional 108 students were added to the school under the NCLB, but due to insufficient space, DeKalb diverted these students to an annex of the school, as allowed by the NCLB. These transferred students were in direct violation of Chamblee's charter, as not all of them met its requirements. This was ignored by the DCSD. The school is adjacent to North Dekalb Stadium, which is used by many sports teams and local schools. The DCSD board has approved construction of a new facility due to the poor conditions of CHS's current facility, such as vermin and insect infestations, mold, and inability to renovate. This new facility will use $58 million in federal stimulus bonds as well as $11 million already set aside by the special-purpose local-option sales tax. Construction of the new facility began in June 2011 and was to be completed by May 2013. The new completion date is August, 2014.  Athletics  The Chamblee Bulldogs participate in baseball, basketball, badminton, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. The varsity football, lacrosse and soccer teams play their home games at North DeKalb Stadium in Chamblee.

The families belonging to this clan ruled several small states in the Bundelkhand region from the 16th century.The Rajputs claim to be Kshatriyas or descendants of Kshatriyas, but their actual status varies greatly, ranging from princely lineages to common cultivators.  Mythical origin  The mythical accounts of the Bundela dynasties trace their ancestry to the Suryavansha (solar dynasty). An example of such an account is that of Gorelal or Lal Kavi (c. 1700 CE), who composed a poetic biography of the Bundela king Chhatrasal. The account goes like this: Brahma originated from Vishnu. The descendants of Brahma were: Marichi, Kashyapa, Surya (the sun; son of Kashyapa and Aditi), Ikshavaku, Dilipa, Raghu, Aja, Dasharatha, Ramachandra, Kusha, Haribrahma, and Vihagaraja. The seventh-generation descendant of Vihagaraja was Kiratdeva, who was the ancestor of Kashi king Virabhadra. The founder of the Bundela dynasty was a descendant of Virabhadra's son Jagdas (also known as Pancham, Devadasa or Hem Karan). Jagdas was a son of Virabhadra's junior queen. After being denied a share in the Kashi kingdom by the four sons of the elder queen, he came to the shrine of the goddess Vindhyavasini. There, he engaged in a long tapasya to seek the goddess' blessings. After failing to evoke response, he decided to sacrifice his head to the deity. As soon as the first drop of his blood fell on the ground, the goddess appeared before him. She declared that his son, a brave hero and a future ruler, would appear from the drop of the blood. This son – Bundela – was named after the drop (bund). The Bundela dynasties worshipped the Vindhyavasini as their kuladevi (family deity).  Expansion legends  According to Bundela legends, Jagdas' descendant Arjunpal was the ruler of Mahoni. His eldest son Birpal succeeded him as the king of Mahoni, although his younger son Sohanpal was the best warrior. To get his share of the kingdom, Sohanpal sought help from Naga (alias Hurmat Singh), the Khangar ruler of Kurar (Kundar). Naga demanded a matrimonial alliance in return. When Sohanpal refused, Naga tried to detain him and forcibly agree him to the condition. Sohanpal escaped, and unsuccessfully sought help from the Chauhans, the Salingars, and the Kachwahas. Ultimately, a Panwar chief named Panpal (or Punyapal) agreed to help him. Their joint army defeated Naga in 1288 CE. Sohanpal killed all the Khangar men in the fort, but spared the babies on the condition that the Khangars would serve as the servants of the Bundelas. Sohanpal became the king of Kurar, and his daughter married Panpal. The Bundelas formed \\"milk brotherhood\\" with the Ahirs. The Ahir wet nurses (dudh ma or \\"milk mothers\\") nourished the Bundela princes with their milk, while the Ahir men served as warriors in the Bundela armies.  Historical kingdoms  Rudra Pratap Singh (reigned 1501-1531 CE), said to be a descendant of Sohanpal, moved his capital from Garh Kundar to Orchha in 1531 CE. The Orchha State was the parent Bundela kingdom. Datia State (1626 CE) and Panna State (1657 CE) separated from the Orchha State. After the death of Panna's founder Chhatrasal in 1731, Ajaigarh State, Bijawar State and Charkhari State separated from Panna. The official records of the Chhatarpur State also mentioned the caste of its rulers as \\"Panwar Bundela\\". Its founder was a Panwar, who was in service of the Bundela ruler of Panna State until 1785 CE. The Bundelkhand (\\"Bundela domain\\") region was named after the Bundelas. The different Bundela chieftains of Bundelkhand often fought against each other which the Mughals often took advantage of.

Building on the success of their G3 design, the company developed a family of small arms (all using the G3 operating principle and basic design concept) consisting of four types of firearms: the first type, chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO; the second, using the Soviet 7.62×39mm M43 round; the third, chambered in the intermediate .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO; and the fourth type, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. Commercially the HK33 was a successful design but it did not sell as well as the G3. The HK33 series of rifles were adopted by the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira or FAB), the armed forces of Thailand and Malaysia where they were produced under a licence agreement. The rifle was also licence-built in Turkey by MKEK, and exported from France branded as MAS but actually made in Germany. Design details =Operating mechanism= A schematic of the Heckler & Koch roller- delayed blowback mechanism The HK33 is a selective fire weapon with Heckler & Koch's roller-delayed blowback system of operation. It employs a two-piece bolt consisting of a bolt head with a pair of rollers and bolt carrier. Upon firing, the two cylindrical rollers in the bolt head are cammed inward by inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and impart a rearward motion on the locking piece, which also propels the bolt carrier rearward. This built-in mechanical disadvantage delays the movement of the bolt head relative to the bolt head carrier which is withdrawing at significant higher velocity of the bolt head. The rollers soon compress entirely into the bolt head, clearing the locking recesses of the barrel extension, and both parts now continue rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls. The G3 roller-delayed blowback mechanism designed around 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition was downsized and revised for reliably using 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. This required changing geometrical transmission ratio relationships between parts. Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the recoil of the bolt head is delayed by a ratio of 3:1 for the 5.56×45mm NATO chambering. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves 3 times faster than the bolt head. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses. Like the G3 bolt the HK33 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \\"bolt head locking lever\\" is a spring- loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt). Further like the G3 the HK33 also contains a spring extractor and a buffer. The ejector lever was installed in the trigger housing and is actuated by the recoiling bolt. =Features= The HK33 is a modular weapon system. Its butt-stock, fore-stock and pistol-grip/fire-control assembly may be changed at will in a variety of configurations (listed below). Simple push-pins hold the components in place and removing them will allow the user to remove and replace parts rapidly. The rifle is disassembled into the following components for maintenance: the receiver/barrel, stock with return spring, bolt assembly and trigger pack in pistol grip. Trigger The HK33 has a conventional hammer-type firing mechanism. In the standard version, the rifle comes equipped with an ambidextrous trigger group with a selector lever that is simultaneously the weapon's safety (it has three positions: \\"S\\" or \\"0\\"—weapon is safe, \\"E\\"/\\"1\\"—semiautomatic fire, \\"F\\"/\\"25\\"—continuous fire). The \\"safe\\" setting mechanically disables the trigger. The trigger groups can be swapped out to meet the user's specific mission requirements. H&K; offers several different trigger assemblies: a three-shot burst fire control group with selector lever/safety (selector settings: \\"0\\" weapon is safe, \\"1\\" single fire, \\"2\\" 2-round burst or \\"3\\" 3-round burst; the selector lever is ambidextrous); a \\"Navy\\" trigger unit (three settings: safe, semi and full auto fire) and a four-position trigger group (selector settings: safe, single fire, 3-round burst and automatic fire). Feeding The rifle is fed from 20- or 25-round steel magazines weighing 250 g or 40-round aluminum magazines (weighing 157 g). 30-round arch magazines were also introduced for use with the rifle. Turkish MKEK-made rifles are issued with 30-round polymer magazines. Barrel The barrel contains 6 right-hand grooves and terminates with a slotted flash suppressor that enables the use of rifle grenades and supports a standard G3-type bayonet that mounts above the barrel. The barrel chamber is fluted, which assists in the initial extraction of a spent cartridge casing (since the breech is opened under very high internal cartridge case pressure). Initially the rifle was produced with a 305 mm (1:12 in) twist rate barrel, which was later upgraded to the faster 178 mm (1:7 in) twist rate (used to stabilize new, heavier NATO-standard SS109/M855 ammunition). Sights Drehvisier rotating drum sight pictures The firearm is equipped with a relatively low iron sight line that consists of a Drehvisier a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: in increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for 5.56×45mm NATO ball ammunition. The receiver housing has recesses that work with STANAG claw mounts/HK clamp adapters (standard with the HK33, G3, G3SG/1 and MP5) used to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4×24 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics. The Hensoldt Fero 4×24 telescopic sight and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero elevation knob features Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings for in increments calibrated for 5.56×45mm NATO ball ammunition. Accessories Included with the rifle are a detachable bipod, bayonet (from the G3), sling, cleaning kit and a magazine loader. Additionally, the HK33 can be used to mount a 40 mm under-barrel HK79 grenade launcher or a blank-firing adaptor. During its production life the rifle has received several minor improvements (these modified weapons are sometimes referred to collectively as the HK33E). The fixed stock was strengthened and the synthetic forearm replaced with a handguard that allows a lightweight bipod to be attached and stowed into two grooves at the base. The shoulder pad in rifles fitted with a telescopic stock was changed to a concave type used thus far in the MP5 series. Variants A Thai Army Military Policeman with the HK33. HK33A2 with Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight ;HK33A2 : Variant with a rigid synthetic stock. ;HK33SG/1 : An accurized model; equipped with a telescopic sight and improved trigger analogous to the one used in the G3SG/1. ;HK33A3 : Standard rifle but with telescoping metal stock. ;HK33KA3 : Carbine version with barrel reduced in length to the base of the front sight post; also equipped with a folding metal stock. Due to the short barrel, the HK33KA3 cannot be used to launch rifle grenades or mount a bayonet. ;HK53KL : Compact version of the HK33K. Has a short barrel, a forearm derived from the MP5 submachine gun and a telescopic shoulder stock or receiver endplate cover (later models also received a four-prong flash hider). ;HK13 : Light machine gun. It is fed from either box or drum magazines (the latter has a 100-round capacity), has a quick-change heavy barrel for sustained fire, shrouded with a sheet metal heat guard (replacing the synthetic forearm) and a 2-point bipod adapter. ;HK23 : Machine gun. It is fed from a disintegrating belt. It is otherwise the same as the HK13. ;Harrington & Richardson T223 :Licensed copy of the HK33 made during the mid-1960sHeckler & Koch entered into an agreement with Harrington & Richardson in 1963 to be their American partner. Heckler & Koch would submit their designs through Harrington & Richardson and their contacts rather than set up an American branch. The HK13/HK23/HK33/HK53 series was offered to Harrington & Richardson in 1964. to compete with the M16 during the smallbore rifle trialsSmall Arms Weapons Systems (SAWS) trial of 1965.. It was mechanically identical to the HK33, except for slight changes to meet the rifle trials requirements. The selector was marked in English (Safe, S.A. (semi-automatic), and F.A. (full automatic)) rather than German (S for Sicher - \\"secure\\", or safe; E for Einzelfeuer - \\"single fire\\", or semi-automatic; and F for Feuerstoss - \\"firing burst\\", or automatic fire). The adjustable bipod was redesigned so that it had a tab that slotted into a mount behind the forend, rather than clamping to the siderails. It used the early straight-walled aluminum 20-round magazine with a bolt hold-open device. There was a lever inside the front of the trigger guard that would release and close the open bolt. The basic T223 kit came with six 20-round magazines, a bipod with carrying case, a bayonet and scabbard, and a webbing-cloth sling. It could also use the later Hecker & Koch curved 25- or 40-round magazines, which gave it more capacity than the M16's 20- and 30-round magazinesThe improved curved magazines were available from 1966. The HK33 and its magazines lack the T223's hold-open system.. It wasn't a popular seller, as any qualified client outside the US military who wanted an HK33 could just buy one (and most were still buying G3s and FALs). It was no longer featured in the company catalog after 1967 and all stocks were sold off when H&R; went bankrupt in 1986. :The Navy SEALs trialed it during the Vietnam War with the extended 40-round magazine as standard. Their rifle kit was similar to the commercial box except it came packed with four 40-round magazines instead. Since the magazines wouldn't fit in standard US web gear pouches, SEALs carried them in Chinese-made webgear for AK47 magazines. Although it was popular, the bias against non-American designs, its lack of compatibility with M16 magazines and accessories, and its higher cost than the M16 kept it from being adopted as a standard weapon. Besides, they were still trying to iron out the problems with the Stoner system. ;Type 11 :A derivative of the HK33 manufactured in Thailand by the Ministry of National Defence for use by the Thai armed forces. A bullpup variant also exists with M16 sights and foregrip for close combat in jungle environments. ;MA-11 :A Myanmar-made version of the HK33 assault rifle which was fielded from the late 90s to early 2000s. It was made by KaPaSa in cooperation with Myanmar Fritz Werner Industries alongside engineers from the Electro-Mechanical and Engineering Corps of the Army of Myanmar (EMEC). A bayonet can be mounted underneath the barrel. It can use STANAG-adapted magazines.The World's Assault Rifles by Johnson and Nelson, Page 217. ;MA-12 :A Myanmar-made light machine gun of the HK33 made under license by KaPaSa in cooperation with Myanmar Fritz Werner Industries alongside engineers from the Electro-Mechanical and Engineering Corps of the Army of Myanmar (EMEC), which had a heavy barrel and bipod with a carry handle. It can use STANAG-adapted magazines. =Sporting variants= The Heckler & Koch HK43 is a semi-automatic rifle based upon the Heckler & Koch HK33 rifle and is the predecessor of the Heckler & Koch HK93. ;HK43 :Heckler & Koch also manufactured a semi-automatic only variant of the HK33A2 for the civilian market called the Heckler & Koch HK43. The HK40-series was designed for sale to conscripts so they could be familiar with their service rifle before entering military service, a common practice in Germany and Switzerland. They had a bayonet mount and furniture just like the military model, but came with a semi-auto trigger pack instead of a full auto trigger pack. This allowed a civilian rifle to be easily made into an assault rifle just by dropping in a full auto trigger pack. It would be succeeded by the HK93A2 and its retractable stock version the HK93A3. The HK93 series had a redesigned semi-automatic trigger pack and metal shelf installed in the trigger group well that made it impossible for it to fit a full-auto trigger pack. It also had the bayonet mount removed and had different furniture. ;C-93 : Civilian semi-automatic sporting version produced by Century International Arms, Inc. It comes with an 18.9 or barrel with a 1:9 twist ratio. A carrying handle and 40-round magazine are standard. Advertised weight is 8.2 lbs. The C-93 is built from Thai Type-11 parts kits using an American made barrel and other miscellaneous American parts.  Combat history  A copy of the Heckler & Koch HK33 was built under licence by Harrington & Richardson as T223 during the Vietnam War. Although heavier than the M16, it was used in small numbers by SEAL teams due to its available 40-round magazine. In Myanmar, the Karen National Liberation Army fielded government-made HK33s. Thai government units fielded HK33s during the South Thailand insurgency. Some of these rifles were seized by groups such as the Patani United Liberation Organisation or the Gerakan Mujahidin Islam Patani. The Kurdistan Workers' Party often claimed it seized HK33s from the Turkish forces. Users An Ecuadoran Marine armed with an HK33E rifle.

Not open to the general public, it is a property of the Max Planck Society and used for conferences.  History  The castle was the creation of Luitpold Emanuel Ludwig Maria, Duke in Bavaria (1890-1973) and his friend Friedrich Attenhuber (1877-1947), a Munich painter. The Duke was a member of the Wittelsbach family, former rulers of Bavaria. Like his famous relative, King Ludwig II, the Duke was obsessed with building fantastical structures. Indeed, Ludwig's Schloss Neuschwanstein inspired Schloss Ringberg. The Duke dedicated his life to building the castle. The two men met at Munich University, where from 1910-14 the Duke studied philosophy and the history of art. Attenhuber first gave painting lessons to the Duke, then traveled through Europe with him. What may have been a love affair developed into something more, with Attenhuber agreeing to supervise the building of the Duke's dream castle. The result was Schloss Ringberg. Everything at Ringberg was designed and crafted by Attenhuber himself, from the architecture to the interior decoration, including the paintings. In 1930, Attenhuber closed his Munich studio, took permanent residence at the castle and changed his painting style (apparently under pressure from the Duke) from post-impressionist to a realistic style close to the Blut und Boden style favoured by the Nazis, though it is not clear that the change was driven by political or ideological motives. He found his models in the farmhouses around the Tegernsee. Many of his paintings in this style hang in the ground and first floor rooms of the castle; on the second floor, paintings in his earlier style are on display. They include, however, his last self-portrait, which shows a reversion to his earlier style Schloss Ringberg aerial view In the 1930s, the relationship between the two men deteriorated drastically. Attenhuber was also tied to the castle since he had lost all his social contacts and the Duke did not allow him to leave. In 1947, Attenhuber jumped to his death from the Schloss Ringberg tower. After his death, Duke Luitpold continued to devote all his energies to the construction of the castle, selling family estates like Possenhofen Castle to pay for the building and travelling the more than 50 kilometres from his home in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich to supervise the progress of the work. He never actually lived in the castle but preferred to lodge at the Hotel Bachmair when he had to stay overnight. When he died in 1973 at the age of 82, he left Schloss Ringberg unfinished. In the mid- sixties, the Duke began to consider what should become of Schloss Ringberg after his death, since he had no direct heir. He requested the Bavarian authorities to grant his castle the status of a historical monument as a way of avoiding heavy tax duties, but his application was rejected. He was therefore confronted with the choice of either selling Schloss Ringberg to the Confederation of German Trade Unions or leaving it as gift to the Max Planck Society. He chose the latter. The contract was signed in 1967 and after the Duke's death in 1973 the castle passed into the hands of the Max Planck Society.

He was a son of Baltar mac Amlaimh and Margaret, daughter of Domhnall, Earl of Lennox. When Domhnall of Lennox died in 1365, Donnchadh's mother Margaret became ruler of Lennox. It had been Domhnall's intention that the marriage would eventually allow the succession of a son, i.e. Donnchadh, but it is probable that Baltar intended to rule in his turn. It is not known how relations deteriorated, but it seems that Donnchadh got impatient. In the summer of 1384, King Robert II issued two charters formally conferring the Mormaerdom on Baltar. However, a year later he and his wife Margaret resigned the Mormaerdom over to their eldest son Donnchadh, and hence Donnchadh became ruler. However, in 1388, Baltar and Margaret were handed custody of the Mormaerdom for the remainder of their lives, with Donnchadh retaining the title. Donnchadh was confined to a stronghold in Loch Lomond, Inchmurrin castle. Donnchadh was forced to form strong ties with the great Robert Stewart, who was the second son of King Robert II by his first wife Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan, and who ruled much of Scotland. In 1392, Donnchadh met Robert at Inchmurrin and agreed to marry his daughter Isabella to Robert's son, Muiredach if Robert could secure him the Mormaerdom. As Domhnall was heirless, the deal ensured that the Mormaerdom would pass to the Stewarts upon Donnchadh's death. It took much of the 1390s, but nevertheless Robert managed to secure his part of the bargain. Donnchadh hence became a part of the Albany Stewart nexus when the Earl of Albany acted as regent during King James's imprisonment in England. Albany refused to ransom King James and tried to prevent his return. After the king's return, they challenged the crown's authority. These Stewart ties led to Donnchadh's downfall. In 1425, he raised his men of Lennox in a revolt against King James I in support of Muiredach and his son Walter and was executed. He was the last male ruler of his line. Marriage and issue During the life of his father Baltar, Donnchadh forged ties with his Argyll neighbours, and married Helen, the daughter of Archibald Campbell of Lochawe.

Hay House has its headquarters in Carlsbad, California and is (as of 2018) run by Reid Tracy. Hay House describes itself as a \\"mind-body-spirit and transformational enterprise\\". Their target audience are readers interested in self-help, personal growth, and alternative medicine. History Hay House was founded in 1984, and incorporated in 1987, to market Louise Hay's self help books, including, Heal Your Body and You Can Heal Your Life. Soon after Hay House began publishing for other authors that fall into the category of mind-body-spirit such as Wayne Dyer, Suze Orman, Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Sylvia Browne, Tavis Smiley and Doreen Virtue. Reid Tracy joined Hay House as an accountant in 1988. He went on to take over as the CEO in 1990 at the age of 25. They are headquartered in Carlsbad, California with auxiliary offices in New York City, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi. According to The New York Times Magazine, the publisher sold more than 6 million books and other products in 2007, bringing in US$100 million in revenues. As of 2018, Hay House reports that they publish books by more than 130 authors and sells their products and services in over 35 countries and that they employ over 100 full time staff members. Mission and practice Hay House publishes authors who write on such topics as psychic reading, energy healing, meditation, tarot cards, alternative medicine, numerology, astrology, and holistic health. Hay House hosts group events where fans can pay for admission to seminars by the authors who can then make presentations. They also publish CDs, DVDs, calendars and card decks. The publisher also offers a radio station, Hay House Radio, which provides live radio shows by Hay House authors.

These services are available as applications for phones and tablets. They also have a division called Balboa Press, a self publishing company, which was created in partnership with Author Solutions in 2010. Hay House promotes the idea that \\"traditional Western learning, as codified by universities that bestow fancy degrees, is woefully incomplete, sometimes harmful, and must be supplemented by other ways of knowing\\". Hay House founder, Louise Hay, explains that Hay House does not actually endorse everything their authors write. They also do turn away some authors and work hard to stay on trend with the latest fashions in self-help. In a 2008 article Oppenheimer quotes current CEO, Reid Tracy, as saying, \\"As of right now we’ve sold over 40 million products in the U.S., and we think a lot of those people have been helped.\\" Hay House does not test the claims made by their authors. The authors gain merit with the publisher based on the testimonials they receive as opposed to the credibility or accuracy of their claims.

His band, Bamada, was a supergroup of West African musicians, which included Kélétigui Diabaté on balafon.  Musical style  Koité is known primarily for his unique approach to playing the guitar by tuning it on a pentatonic scale and playing on open strings as one would on a kamale n'goni. His music is also influenced by blues or flamenco which are two styles he learned under Khalilou Traore. Koité's vocal style is intimate and relaxed, emphasizing calm, moody singing rather than operatic technical prowess. Members of Bamada play the following instruments: talking drum, guitar, bass, drum set, harmonica, violin, calabash, and balafon. Koité composes and arranges all songs, singing in English, French, and Bambara.  History  Malian guitarist Habib Koité is one of Africa’s most popular and recognized musicians. Habib comes from a noble line of Khassonké griots, traditional troubadors who provide wit, wisdom and musical entertainment at social gatherings and special events. Habib grew up surrounded by seventeen brothers and sisters, and developed his unique guitar style accompanying his griot mother. He inherited his passion for music from his paternal grandfather who played the kamele n’goni, a traditional four-stringed instrument associated with hunters from the Wassolou region of Mali. \\"Nobody really taught me to sing or to play the guitar,\\" explains Habib, \\"I watched my parents, and it washed off on me.\\" Habib was headed for a career as an engineer, but on the insistence of his uncle, who recognized Habib's musical talent, he enrolled at the National Institute of Arts (INA) in Bamako, Mali. In 1978, after only six months, he was made conductor of INA Star, the school's prestigious band. He studied music for four years, graduating at the top of his class in 1982. (In fact his talent was so impressive, that upon graduation, the INA hired him as a guitar teacher). During his studies, Habib had the opportunity to perform and play with a series of recognized Malian artists, including Kélétigui Diabaté and Toumani Diabaté. He sang and played on Toumani Diabaté's 1991 release Shake the World (Sony), and Kélétigui Diabaté became later now a fulltime member of Habib’s band. Habib takes some unique approaches to playing the guitar. He tunes his instrument to the pentatonic scale and plays on open strings as one would on a kamale n'goni. At other times Habib plays music that sounds closer to the blue, style he studied under Khalilou Traoré a veteran of the legendary Afro-Cuban band Maravillas du Mali. Unlike the griots, his singing style is restrained and intimate with varying cadenced rhythms and melodies. Mali has rich and diverse musical traditions, which have many regional variations and styles that are particular to the local cultures. Habib is unique because he brings together different styles, creating a new pan-Malian approach that reflects his open-minded interest in all types of music. The predominant style played by Habib is based on the danssa, a popular rhythm from his native city of Keyes. He calls his version danssa doso, a Bambara term he coined that combines the name of the popular rhythm with the word for hunter’s music (doso), one of Mali’s most powerful and ancient musical traditions. “I put these two words together to symbolize the music of all ethnic groups in Mali. I’m curious about all the music in the world, but I make music from Mali. In my country, we have so many beautiful rhythms and melodies. Many villages and communities have their own kind of music. Usually, Malian musicians play only their own ethnic music, but me, I go everywhere. My job is to take all these traditions and to make something with them, to use them in my music.” In 1988, Habib formed his own group, Bamada (a nickname for residents of Bamako that roughly translates \\"in the mouth of the crocodile\\"), with young Malian musicians who had been friends since childhood. In 1991, Habib won first prize at the Voxpole Festival in Perpignan, France, which earned him enough money to finance the production of two songs. One of those tracks, “Cigarette A Bana (The Cigarette is Finished)” was a hit throughout West Africa. After the release of another successful single entitled, \\"Nanalé (The Swallow),” Habib received the prestigious Radio France International (RFI) Discoveries prize. This award made it possible for the group to undertake their first tour outside of Africa during the summer of 1994. In 1994, Habib met his current manager, Belgian Michel De Bock, director of the management and production company Contre-Jour. Working together, they recorded his first album Muso Ko. Upon its release the album quickly reached #2 in the European World Music Charts. From that point forward, Habib became a fixture on the European festival circuit and began to spread his infectious music and high energy shows around the world. Habib has played at most of Europe’s major venues and festivals. Habib’s second album, Ma Ya, was released in Europe in 1998 to widespread acclaim. It spent an amazing three months at the top spot on the World Charts Europe. A subtle production which revealed a more acoustic, introspective side of Habib’s music, Ma Ya was released in North America by Putumayo World Music in early 1999 and with sales over 100 000 units, worldwide, this success quickly helped establish , Habib as one of world music’s most exciting new figures. The critical and commercial response to Ma Ya was tremendous. In 2001, Habib Koité and Bamada became one the few African artists to appear on Late Night with David Letterman one of America’s most popular television variety shows, Habib’s artistry and powerful personality earned him some fans such as Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt, both of whom ended up visiting Habib in Mali. They have both done a great deal to support Habib’s music, by promoting private events designed to attract new audiences and even performing live with Habib on stage. Habib and his band even made a guest appearance on Bonnie Raitt’s 2002 album Silver Lining, in which Bonnie and Habib performed a duet on the co-written song “Back Around.” Habib Koite & Bamada released their third album, Baro, in 2001. The recording was also a huge success, selling more than 100,000 copies worldwide and further expanding Habib’s global audience. One of the keys to Habib’s success has been is dedication to touring. A true road warrior, Habib Koite & Bamada have performed nearly 1500 shows since 1994 and appeared on some of the world’s most prestigious concert stages. Habib has also participated in a number of memorable theme tours alongside other artists. In the spring 2000, he toured Europe as an invited guest with the legendary avant-garde jazz group, the Art Ensemble of Chicago. In the fall of 2000, Habib participated in the “Voices of Mali” tour with Oumou Sangare. In 2006 & 2007, Habib has also taken part in the Desert Blues project with fellow Malians Tartit and Afel Boucoum and Acoustic Africa tour with South African troubadour Vusi Mahlasela and the rising young star Dobet Gnahoré from the Ivory Coast. Habib Koite & Bamada’s transfixing performances have endeared them to an ever-growing audience, and in 2003 they released Fôly!, a double CD of live material. Devoted fans have waited a long time for Habib to return to the recording studio. In 2007 the band was on the road to present their new album « Afriki », a great combination of the Malian rhythmes, a meeting between tradition and more contemporay waves, with nice & intimate melodies. Recorded between Bamako, Brussels and Vermont (USA), this album is like a bridge between those 3 continents as well. For 2008, new adventures for Habib and the Bamada; a mandinguo opera created in collaboration Mondomiw and with 2.500 enfants in the South of France who learned some songs written by Habib and presented in nice venues like the Palace of the Festival in Cannes. After the big success, they made it again the year after in 2009. In 2010, a new version of the project Acoustic Africa was presented in Europe , Usa & Africa, with Afel Bocoum (Mali) & Oliver Mtukudzi (Zimbabwe) . A live CD & DVD were recorded during those tours During the Fall 2011 & 2013 , Habib participated to the Dutch project « 5 Great Guitars » created by Jan Kuiper, with 2 periods of tour with more than 30 concerts each. In 2013, they were touring with 2 great Brasilian voices for a project called African Samba. In 2012, Habib recorded in Bamako « Brothers in Bamako »; in collaboration with the US bluesman Eric Bibb, met in 1997, for the promotion of the Putumyao compilation ‘From Mali to Memphis » . Since this time, they kept the idea to play again together … The duo has been joined by Malian percussionist Mama Kone for more than 120 dates in Europe and the USA since the release of the album. \\"Soô\\", released in 2014, was realized and recorded in Bamako with a new group of young musicians, composed of two brothers, Issa (guitar, banjo) and Mama Koné (percussion), Charly Coulibaly (keyboard) surrounded by Abdoul Wahab Berthé (bass, kamala n'goni) of the original group Bamada. After presenting this album in Europe and in the USA, Habib is happy to be back with Vusi Mahalasela for a new US Acoustic Africa tour in the spring of 2016. At the end of 2016, and the year 2017, Habib and his band continue to delight audiences in Europe (including a beautiful UK tour). In 2018, between a few tour periods with his band, Habib will be touring Europe with Bassekou Kouyate and Amy Sacko. Both the shared pleasure of playing together and the enthusiasm of the public pushed these two leaders to continue the adventure in the US in spring 2019. But ... it was not counting on the problems of visas more and more palpable even for musicians on the roads for many years. And, Bassekou & Amy did not get their visas in time. Habib has therefore proposed these dates in US duet with his percussionist Mama Kone, for an intimate formula that has attracted much interest from the public. The Koite - Kouyate project - however, was presented in Canada for a few dates. recorded entirely in Bamako at the Maya studio, with the complicity of some guests such as Toumani Diabaté, Amy Sacko, Sekou Bembeya Kouyate guitar maestro, M'Bouillé Koite (2017 RFi Award) and CT Koite, son of Habib who has wrote and performed a piece of the album. The sound of the country, its rich and diversified musical traditions and its instruments (ngoni, flute, kora, doun doun ...) permeate the twelve titles that make up this superb project. With more than 400,000 albums sold, more than 1,700 concerts around the world, Habib has built, step by step, an exemplary career, with always a foot firmly rooted in its culture  Discography  Habib Koité 2014 at the Bardentreffen music festival in Nuremberg =Albums= * Muso Ko, 1995 * Ma Ya, 1998 * Baro, 2001 * Live!, 2004 * Afriki, 2007 * Acoustic Africa in concert, 2011 * Brothers in Bamako, 2012 * Soô, 2014 *Kharifa, 2017 = Notable songs = Foro Bana, a song that appeared in Koité's 1998 album Ma Ya, has been praised for its innovative guitar picking and melodious tunes.

He was a Woiworrung and Yorta Yorta man at Wallaga Lake in southern New South Wales. He was originally named Harry Penrith but took the name of his great grandfather, which means Great Warrior. He was orphaned at an early age and spent many years in children's homes run by the NSW Aborigines Welfare Board, most notably Kinchela Boys Home at Kempsey. The Welfare Board promoted his achievements in his rugby league and surf lifesaving at Kempsey in Dawn, and reported that he left Kinchela to become an Aboriginal pioneer in the NSW Public Service, working for the Department of Agriculture, where he remained for 13 years. He also played first grade Rugby Union for Parramatta, and both rugby league and cricket.Dawn, 1952 to circa 1963, see While attending the University of Tasmania in the late 1960s, he led a successful movement to reclaim the remains of Truganini from the Tasmanian Museum for cremation. He was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1975 to study other Indigenous people. He may be best remembered for planting the Aboriginal flag on the white cliffs of Dover on the Australian Bicentenary Day of 26 January 1988. This was his tongue-in- cheek way of claiming England, as Arthur Phillip had done to Burnum Burnum's homeland in 1788 when arriving with the First Fleet.

The first was Dark Age, a thriller set in outback and tropical Australia, and which also starred David Gulpillil as Burnum's son. The second was Ground Zero, a thriller containing themes critical of the British and Australian governments' treatment of Indigenous Australians during nuclear weapon testing at Maralinga. The third was a satirical film, Marsupials: The Howling III, in which Burnum's character becomes a werewolf in the form of a Tasmanian tiger.Norst, Marlene. 1999. Burnum Burnum: A Warrior for Peace.

Being semi-aquatic it is very similar to modern crocodiles. It ranged from 2–4 metres in length, and would have had a very similar lifestyle to the American alligator or Nile crocodile. Discovery and species G. crassidens holotype BMNH 3798 G. simus restoration The type species of the genus is G. crassidens which is known from the Berriasian of England, and the referable species G simus from the Berriasian of NW Germany, might be conspecific. Other species that are referable to Goniopholis include G. kiplingi from the Berriasian of England, and G. baryglyphaeus from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of Portugal making it the oldest known Goniopholis species. The species G. kiplingi honors the author Rudyard Kipling, \\"in recognition for his enthusiasm for natural sciences\\". Eggs attributed to Goniopholis were found in the Late Jurassic of Portugal.Russo, J., Mateus O., Marzola M., & Balbino A. (2017). Two new ootaxa from the late Jurassic: The oldest record of crocodylomorph eggs, from the Lourinhã Formation, Portugal. PLOS ONE. 12, 1-23. =Formerly assigned species= Two species were referred to Goniopholis from Brazil. Goniopholis hartti from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil is in fact a member of the genus Sarcosuchus. G. paulistanus, based on two tooth crowns and a disassociated fragment of the right tibia from the Upper Cretaceous Bauru Group, has been reassigned to Itasuchidae and given its own genus Roxochampsa. From North America, G. lucasii and G. kirtlandicus are currently placed in their own genera Amphicotylus and Denazinosuchus, respectively, while G. felix, G. gilmorei, and G. stovalli, all from the Morrison Formation, are referable to Amphicotylus and closely related to Eutretauranosuchus which are known from the same formation. G. phuwiangensis is known from NE Thailand, but this species is fragmentary and was recently reassigned to Sunosuchus. Nannosuchus from the Early Cretaceous (Berriasian stage) of England and Spain currently considered to be valid, was referred to as G. gracilidens by some authors. Willett's / Hulke's, Hooley's and Dollo's goniopholidids represent several complete specimens previously classified as either G. simus or G. crassidens, and one of them was recently re-described as the new species, G. willetti. More recently these specimens were removed from Goniopholis, and two of them, Hooley's and Hulke's goniopholidids, have been already reassigned to their own genera Anteophthalmosuchus and Hulkepholis, respectively. Dollo's goniopholidid has also been assigned to Anteophthalmosuchus.

According to local legend, the Shia community in Jabal Amil is one of the oldest in history, second only to the Shia community of Medina, and were converted to Islam by Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and an early supporter of Ali. Although there is frequent occurrence of this account in many religious sources, it is largely dismissed in academia, and historical sources suggest Shiism developed in Jabal Amel around the 3rd century A.H. The region is named after the Saleh Al Amel Banu 'Amilah, a Christian Yemenite tribe who, along with the kindred tribes of Hamadan, Lakhm, and Judham, settled in Syria, Palestine, parts of Jordan, and south Lebanon. The area was known in ancient times as Jabal 'Amilah, and later as Jabal 'Amil (Jabal Amel) or Belad Bechara. A legendary story has it that the tribe of Christian Banu 'Amilah migrated from Yemen to the Levant in pre- Islamic times because of a flood caused by the destruction of the Marib Dam.  Demographics  The inhabitants of Jabal Amel are mainly descendants of the population that has lived there since time immemorial, such as the Phoenicians who began speaking Aramaic. In addition, some families are descendants of the Southern Arab tribes that assimilated with the native population before Islamic conquest (most importantly Banu Amela). At such times, the majority who were Aramaic speakers also lived alongside small pockets of Greek, Arabic, and Persian speakers. This would form into the population of Lebanese known today. Besides Shi'a Muslims, other religious groups include: *Sunni Muslims (Sidon, Ain al-Meir, Yarine, Marwahine, Kfar Hamam, Kfar) *Druze (Hasbaya area) *Jews (Marjeyoun, Bint Jbeil, Sidon, Tyre, Hasbaya area) *Maronite and Greek Catholics (Ain Ebel, Aishieh, Alma Chaab, Bkassine, Debel, Jezzine, Kfar Falous, Maghdouché, Marjeyoun, Mieh ou Mieh, Rmaich, and Qaouzah) *Greek Catholics (Deir Mimas, Ibel el Saqui, Kfaroueh, Marjeyoun, Markaba, Qlaia and Jezzine) *Greek Orthodox Christians (Marjayoun, Deir Mimas, Rachaya Al Foukhar and Hasbaya areas) *Armenians (Ain Ebel) *Alewites (Ghajar village) (southern part occupied by Israel as part of the Golan heights) The towns of Baraachit, Khiam, Tebnine, Safad El Batikh, and Yaroun and many towns in municipal of Jezzine such as Mlikh, have a mixed population of Shi'a and Christians.

Caption: ETOYC ΙΘ΄ / BACIΛΕΩC ΠΟΛΕΜΩΝΟC. Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros, also known as Polemon II of Pontus and Polemon of Cilicia (; 12 BC/11 BC–74), was a prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia. He served as a Roman Client King of Pontus, Colchis, and Cilicia. Polemon II was the second son and middle child of the Pontic Rulers Polemon Pythodoros and Pythodorida of Pontus. His eldest brother was Zenon, also known as Artaxias III, who was Roman Client King of Armenia. His youngest sister was Antonia Tryphaena, who was married to Cotys VIII, King of Thrace.  Family  The Pontic royal family was of mixed Anatolian, Greek, and Roman origin. His paternal grandmother is unknown; however his paternal grandmother could have been named Tryphaena, while his paternal grandfather was Zenon, a prominent orator, aristocrat, and ally to Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. His maternal grandparents were Pythodoros of Tralles, a wealthy Greek and friend of Pompey, and Antonia. Polemon II was the namesake of his parents and his maternal grandparents. Through his maternal grandmother he was a direct descendant of Mark Antony and his second wife, Antonia Hybrida Minor. Antony and Antonia Hybrida were first paternal cousins. He was Antony's second born great grandson and great grandchild. Polemon II is the only known male descendant of Mark Antony that carries his name. The other male descendant of Mark Antony who carries a form of his name, Antonius, was the consul Quintus Haterius Antoninus. Through Antony, his great maternal aunt was Queen Cleopatra Selene II of Mauretania. Through Antony, he was a distant cousin to Roman Client King Ptolemy of Mauretania and the princesses named Drusilla of Mauretania. Through Antony, he was also a distant cousin to Roman emperors Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, and Roman empresses Valeria Messalina, Agrippina the Younger, and Claudia Octavia.  Reign  Polemon II's father died in 8 BC. His mother then married King Archelaus of Cappadocia, and the family had moved to Cappadocia, where Polemon II and his siblings were raised at the court of their stepfather. Archelaus died in 17, whereupon Polemon II and his mother moved back to Pontus. From 17 until 38, Polemon II lived as a private citizen in Pontus and assisted his mother in the administration of their realm. When his mother died in 38, Polemon II succeeded his mother as the sole ruler of Pontus, Colchis and Cilicia. According to an honorary inscription at Cyzicus in 38, Polemon II participated in celebrating the local games in the city, honoring Julia Drusilla, the late sister of Caligula;IGRR IV 145 in this way Polemon II expressed his loyalty to the emperor and the Roman state. With another Roman Client King, Antiochus IV of Commagene, Polemon II held athletic games in honor of Claudius in Cilicia in 47. Antiochus IV with Polemon II had showed favor towards Claudius in which they offered significant services to him.  Marriages  Around 50, Polemon II was attracted to the wealth and beauty of the Judean princess Julia Berenice, whom he had met in Tiberias during a visit to King Herod Agrippa I. Berenice in turn wanted to marry Polemon II to end rumors that she and her brother were committing incest. Berenice had become a widow in 48 when her second husband, her paternal uncle Herod of Chalcis, died. She had two sons by him, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. Berenice set the condition that Polemon II had to convert to Judaism, which included undergoing the rite of circumcision, before marriage. Polemon II assented, and the marriage went ahead. It did not last long, however, and Berenice left Pontus with her sons and returned to the court of her brother. Polemon II abandoned Judaism and, according to the legend of Bartholomew the Apostle, he accepted Christianity, only to become a pagan again. At an unknown date, perhaps after the early 50s, Polemon II married a princessBirley, Septimius Severus: The African Emperor, p. 70 called Julia Mamaea, who was from the Syrian Roman Client Emesene Kingdom.Levick, Julia Domna: Syrian Empress Mamaea was of Assyrian, Armenian, Greek, and Median ancestry. Polemon II married Mamaea as his second wife,Coinage of Polemon II and Julia Mamaea and the circumstances that lead Polemon II to marry her are unknown. Through Mamaea's marriage to him, she became a Roman Client Queen of Pontus, Colchis, and Cilicia. The relationship between Polemon II and Mamaea is unknown. Her name and identity is revealed from surviving bronze coinage.Birley, Septimius Severus: The African Emperor, p.222 Surviving coinage that was issued from Polemon II and Mamaea is extremely rare, as only three specimens are known. These coins show her royal title in Greek, ΙΟΥΛΙΑΣ ΜΑΜΑΙΑΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗΣTemporini, Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt: Principat, p.926 (of Julia Mamaea the Queen) or ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗΣ ΙΟΥΛΙΑΣ ΜΑΜΑΙΑΣ (of Queen Julia Mamaea). These coins can be dated from the second half of Polemon II's reign from 60 until 74. Mamea bore Polemon II two sons, Polemon and Rhoemetalces.On the Polemonid dynasty - see R.D. Sullivan, \\"Dynasts in Pontus\\", ANRW 7.2 (1980), pp. 925-930. For the intermarriages between the Polemonids and other dynasties of East Asia Minor, see R.D. Sullivan, \\"Papyri reflecting the Eastern Dynastic Network\\", ANRW 2.8 (1977), p. 919 The sons that she bore to Polemon II are known from a restored surviving inscription from Amphipolis Greece,Temporini, Politische Geschichte (Provinzen und Randvölker: Griechischer Balkanraum; Kleinasien): Griechischer Balkanraum; Kleinasien), p. 929 that commemorates Polemon II, Polemon and Rhoemetalces, and is dated from the second half of the 1st century. Polemon II renamed the town Fanizan after himself. He changed the name to Polemonium (modern Fatsa, Turkey). In 62, Nero induced Polemon II to abdicate the Pontian throne, and Pontus, including Colchis, became a Roman province. From then until his death, Polemon II only ruled Cilicia.

The clocks' bodies are effectively specialized censers that hold incense sticks or powdered incense that have been manufactured and calibrated to a known rate of combustion, used to measure minutes, hours, or days. The clock may also contain bells and gongs which act as strikers. Although the water clock and astronomical clock were known in China (example: Su Song), incense clocks were commonly used at homes and temples in dynastic times. History In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks were used in Asia and were fashioned in several different forms.Richards, p. 52 Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; spread to Japan, as one survives in the Shōsōin. Although popularly associated with China the incense clock is believed by some to have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form, if not function.Schafer (1963), pages 160-161Bedini (1994), pages 69-80 Early incense clocks found in China between the 6th and 8th centuries CE all seem to have Devanāgarī carvings on them rather than Chinese seal characters. To explain this, the American historian and sinologist Edward Schafer asserts that incense clocks were probably an Indian invention, transmitted to China. American historian Silvio Bedini on the other hand asserts that incense clocks were derived in part from incense seals mentioned in Tantric Buddhist scriptures, which first came to light in China after those scriptures from India were translated into Chinese, but holds that the time-telling function of the seal was incorporated by the Chinese. Types Several types of incense clock have been found, the most common forms include the incense stick and incense seal. =Stick incense clocks= An incense stick clock uses incense sticks that have been calibrated to known burning rates. Most of these clocks were elaborate, sometimes having threads with weights attached at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a set amount of time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray.Levy, p. 18 Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance.Richards, p. 130 The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples. In fact one of the side jobs of the time keeper in ancient Chinese cities was to mark calibrated incense with individual lines, to denote length of a burn for sale to the public. This was done to supplement the individual's often meager incomes. In Chinese medicine doctors would make multiple partial breaks on an incense stick as instructions to the patient such that the patient would take a dose of medication every time the incense has burned to one of these breaks. In Japan, a geisha was paid for the number of senko-dokei (incense clocks) that had been consumed while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. =Powdered incense clocks= Incense seal clocks are essentially specialized censers, that work through burning lines of powdered incense seals (香印 xiāng yìn in Chinese; 香時計 ko-dokei in Japanese). They were used for similar occasions and events as the stick incense clock. While religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.Bedini, pp. 103–104 The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed.Fraser, p. 52 These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a set amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or differently scented incense could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related to the size of the seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.Bedini, p. 105Fraser, p. 56 While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. They were often made of paktong in the form of multileveled small boxes with patterned perforated tops. Gold and silver powder incense clocks are considered quite rare. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.Bedini, pp. 104–106 Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.Bedini, p. 187 Although they are no longer used formally for time keeping, such incense clocks are still used by scholars and monks in the East for evoking moods and for aesthetics. Using incense seal clocks requires a period of preparation. A fine layer of damp white wood ash is first laid down in a small container, flattened, and lightly compacted. Seals that were in the form of patterned metal stencils were simply laid down on the ash while the incense powder was poured over it. After a light compaction of the incense powder by a tamper, lifting up the metal seal forms a long trail of incense powder that has been masked onto the ash. Other seals have a protruded pattern that creates a negative indentation in the wood ash. The incense powder is carefully spooned into the indentation in the ash and then recompacted again with the seal.

Tonalist won the Peter Pan Stakes in May 2014. He is the first horse since A.P. Indy in 1992 to win the Peter Pan/Belmont double. Later in the year he defeated older horses to win the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Background Tonalist in saddling paddock, note distinctively-shaped blaze marking on his face Tonalist is an unusually large bay colt, standing high. with an irregular white blaze bred in Kentucky by the Virginia-based Woodslane Farm. He was sired by Tapit, a gray son of Pulpit, who won the Wood Memorial Stakes and started second favorite for the 2004 Kentucky Derby. Tapit has become a successful breeding stallion with other progeny including Hansen, Stardom Bound, Tapitsfly (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf), Tapizar (Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile) and Untapable (Kentucky Oaks). Tonalist's dam, Settling Mist, a daughter of the Kentucky Derby winner Pleasant Colony, won once from nineteen starts in 2002 and 2003. As a great- granddaughter of the broodmare Missy Baba, Settling Mist was closely related to several major winners including Summer Squall, A.P. Indy, Duke of Marmalade and Lemon Drop Kid. As a yearling, Tonalist was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton Sale in August 2012, by Wayne and Cathy Sweezey on behalf of Woodlane Farm's owners, Rene and Lauren Woolcott. Wayne Sweezey described the colt as \\"one of the most stunning horses we had ever had on the farm. I've raised a lot of horses in my time, and he was special – not only in his looks but also in his temperament\\" but explained that after a \\"growth spurt\\" in July he looked less impressive when he entered the sales ring. He was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of $195,000. Shortly after the sale Tonalist was bought privately by Robert S. Evans largely because of a family connection: his father Thomas Mellon Evans had won the Kentucky Derby with Pleasant Colony. The colt was sent into training with the French-born trainer Christophe Clement, best known as a trainer of turf horses. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= On his only appearance as a two-year-old, Tonalist started a 16-1 outsider for a maiden race at Aqueduct Race Track on November 16 and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Matterhorn. According to Equibase, he was towards the rear in the early stages and was forced five wide on the final turn but made some progress in the closing stages. =2014: three-year-old season= Tonalist after the Belmont Tonalist began his second season at Gulfstream Park in Florida, winning a maiden race over nine furlongs in January and running second to Constitution in an allowance race a month later. Any chance he had of competing in the major trials for the Triple Crown ended when he contracted a lung infection which disrupted his training schedule. In May he was moved up sharply in class when he contested the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. Wearing blinkers for the first time, he was ridden by Joel Rosario and started the 6-5 favorite against six opponents on a \\"sloppy\\" track. He stumbled at the start but recovered to take the lead after a quarter of a mile and went clear in the straight to win by four lengths from Commissioner. After the race Clement commented \\"What impressed me was the last eighth of a mile, when he opened up again. I was very worried about the wet track. I don't breeze my horses on the wet track so that was a complete question mark. He answered that pretty nicely. Let's see how the horse comes out of it, but of course we have to think about the Belmont Stakes\\". Rosario said \\"He was doing it easy; he was doing it on his own. I don't think we were going that fast. He can go a mile and a half; I think he can run all day. He's a big horse with a long stride, when you get him in the bridle, the more you ask, the more he'll give\\". Tonalist after winning the 2014 Belmont, Joel Rosario up On June 7, in front of a crowd of 120,000, Tonalist contested the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes which attracted much attention as California Chrome, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes attempted to become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to complete the Triple Crown. Clement professed his lack of concern when Tonalist was drawn on the complete outside of the eleven runner field, saying \\"He's a really, really big horse with a long stride, so he can basically run his own race without worrying about anybody else.\\" After a late surge of support in the betting, he started the 9.2/1 fifth choice behind California Chrome, Wicked Strong, Ride on Curlin (runner-up in the Preakness) and Commanding Curve (runner-up in the Derby). Tonalist broke well from his outside draw and was third behind Commissioner and General A Rod after the first half mile. He maintained his position despite being forced four wide on the final turn and gradually wore down the opposition in the straight to win by a head from Commissioner, with Medal Count in third and California Chrome dead heating with Wicked Strong for fourth. After the race Rosario commented \\"He was going easy, I didn't want to be too far behind. When I got to the three-eighths pole I was a little confident. I was worried a little bit turning for home, but he started picking them up.\\" Evans said \\"This morning I went to my father's grave and thanked him for putting me in this position. I've been where Steve Coburn has been, and it's not fun. I remember it was real quiet after we lost [when Pleasant Colony finished third in the Belmont] in 1981.\\" When asked to respond to Coburn's statement that he had taken the \\"coward's way\\" by not running his horse in the first two legs of the series, Evans said \\"I don’t think I have a comment on that\\". Tonalist returned from a seven-week break for the Jim Dandy Stakes over nine furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on July 26. He raced in fifth place before making progress in the straight but was unable to catch Wicked Strong and finished second, beaten two and a quarter lengths. In the Travers Stakes on August 23, he pressed the pace on front-running Bayern and ran second for most of the race, but though he ran willingly, finished third behind winner V.E. Day and second place Wicked Strong.http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/SAR082314USA12.pdf On September 27 Tonalist faced Wicked Strong, V.E. Day and the leading older horse Moreno in the Jockey Club Gold Cup over ten furlongs at Belmont. For this race Clement removed the blinkers that the colt had worn in his recent races. He started the 3-1 favorite and won by one and three-quarter lengths from Zivo with Long River in third. Moreno was disqualified from fourth to last for cutting in and clipping heels with Wicked Strong,http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/BEL092714USA10.pdf resulting in the fall of his jockey, Rajiv Maragh, who suffered a broken arm. Wicked Strong ran loose on the track, but did not cause problems for the other horses as he moved to the outside. After the race, Clement admitted that he should have run the horse without blinkers in the Travers while Rosario said \\"He didn't get out very quick, but I just let him run on his own... He's a one- paced horse, and when he starts going, he goes forever\\". In the thirty-first running of the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park on November 1, Tonalist started the 4.4/1 joint second choice in the betting, behind Shared Belief and alongside California Chrome. Rosario held the colt up at the back of the fourteen runner field in the early stages and although Tonalist made steady progress in the second half of the race he never looked likely to threaten the leaders and finished fifth, five length behind the winner Bayern. =2015: four-year-old season= Tonalist in the saddling paddock prior to the 2014 Belmont Tonalist began his third season in the Grade III Westchester Handicap at Belmont on May 2, 2015. He maintained his perfect record at the track, overcoming a low start to win by three and three-quarter lengths from Confrontation. Commenting on the colt's progress, his jockey Joe Bravo said, \\"He was a boy (when I rode him at Gulfstream) and it's funny to now see him as a man. He just completely grew into himself.\\" On 6 June, Tonalist started the 1.7/1 favorite for the Metropolitan Handicap over a mile at Belmont, facing a field which included Bayern, Wicked Strong and Honor Code. After being restrained in the early stages he made steady progress in the straight and finished second, three and three-quarter lengths behind the winner Honor Code. Four weeks later, Tonalist carried top weight of 123 pounds in the Suburban Handicap and started 9/20 favorite but was beaten a head into second by the James Jerkens-trained Effinex. The colt was the beaten favorite for the third time in succession when he contested the Whitney Stakes at Saratoga on August 8: on this occasion he finished strongly after trailing the field for most of the way to take third behind Honor Code and Liam's Map. On October 3, after an eight-week break, Tonalist attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Jockey Club Gold Cup and started favorite ahead of five opponents including Effinex, Wicked Strong and Constitution (Donn Handicap). After racing towards the rear he took the lead in the stretch and drew away to win by four and three quarter lengths from Wicked Strong, with Effinex almost seven lengths back in third. Clement commented \\"I've never lost my faith in the horse. I never thought he was disappointing, he was a bit unlucky for the year, but the way he won today was very impressive\\". Following a fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic on October 31 and a win in the Cigar Mile Handicap on November 28, Tonalist was retired. Owner Robert Evans said at the time of Tonalist's retirement that the horse was still sound and he was planning to race him in 2016, but \\"the economic pressures make it hard to keep him in training.\\" Tonalist will stand at Bill Farish's Lane's End Farm in 2016.

The original compilation was Metal for Muthas, released in February 1980. The compilation was a sampling of various better-known artists of the NWOBHM, primarily known for having some of the earliest recorded material by heavy metal legends Iron Maiden. The original Metal for Muthas album reached No. 12 on the British LP chartsE. F. Band biography and became the basis of a tour by the artists who contributed songs to the compilation. Iron Maiden, who headlined the tour, became largely intertwined with the history of Sanctuary Records (whose namesake was the similarly named Iron Maiden track on the compilation). Metal For Muthas was followed by a second similar compilation, Metal for Muthas Volume II. The compilation featured less notable artists of the NWOBHM but is also reminiscent of the DIY ethic of the late 1970s and early 1980s British heavy metal underground scene.

Unfortunately only one nuclei is simply immunoreactive to just one of three calcium binding proteins, and that is the centromedial nuclei which stains for parvalbumin. A given region usually stains for two of the three proteins—parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin The neurons comprising the core are believed to be involved in propagation of 'driving' information, whereas neurons comprising the matrix are believed to play a more modulatory role. Overall, the calcium-binding proteins show a complementary staining pattern in the human thalamus. In general terms, the highest density of parvalbumin stain is in the nuclei of the ventral nuclear group (i.e. in the ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral posterior nuclei) and in the medial and lateral geniculate nuclear groups. Moderate amounts of parvalbumin staining are also present in regions of the medio- dorsal nucleus (MD). By contrast, calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivity show a similar distribution of dense staining in the rostral intralaminar nuclear group and in the patchy regions of the MD thalamus which appears to complement the pattern of parvalbumin staining. However, calbindin and calretinin also show low levels of staining in the ventral nuclear group and in the medial and lateral geniculate bodies which overlaps with the intense parvalbumin staining in these regions. These results show that the calcium- binding proteins are heterogeneously distributed in a complementary fashion within the nuclei of the thalamus. The primate thalamus consists of a matrix of calbindin immunoreactive cells and a superimposed core of parvalbumin immunoreactive cells which may have differential patterns of cortical projections.

History Lodi Township was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, on March 1, 1826, from the southern portion of New Barbadoes Township.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 80. Accessed October 7, 2015. On February 22, 1840, Hudson County was created from territories that had been Bergen Township (1693) and from the southern portion of Lodi Township. The portion of Lodi Township taken at this time formed the new Harrison Township in Hudson County. The border between the newly created Harrison Township in Hudson County and the portion of Lodi Township remaining in Bergen County was the New Barbadoes Turnpike, which is now called Paterson Plank Road. In 1852, some of the residents of the northern portion of Harrison Township requested to be returned to Bergen County. This area -- which had been part of Lodi Township -- was returned to Bergen County as Union Township. On February 21, 1893, Bergen Township (1893) was created from the southern section of Lodi Township. In 1894, with \\"Boroughitis\\" at its peak, the subdivision of Lodi Township kicked off with the creation of three boroughs: Hasbrouck Heights (July 31, 1894), Little Ferry (September 18, 1894) and Lodi (December 21, 1894). Moonachie was created on April 11, 1910, followed by Teterboro on March 26, 1917. During this period, several exchanges of territory were made with neighboring municipalities.Honeyman, Abraham Van Doren.

The immediate cause of this was the \\"Lodi Township Sewer Scandal\\" of 1930, allegedly a corrupt municipal contract to build a sewer where there were, as yet, no streets. State Senator Ralph W. Chandless was expelled from the New Jersey State Senate as a result of his role in this scandal. The campaign to expose the scandal and those involved in it, including Chandless, was led by The Bergen Evening Record of Hackensack, NJ, later \\"The Bergen Record\\" and now The Record of Hackensack.Armand Palazzi. South Hackensack celebrates: America's Bicentennial, 1776-1976; sesquicentennial, 1826-1976. N.p., n.d. [1976]. Arguably the sewer, built mainly along what is now Green Street, was a sensible idea intended to attract commercial and industrial development. Due to the Great Depression development did not take place until after World War II. The sewer line in question still exists in South Hackensack. Manhole covers along Green Street with the legend \\"Lodi Towns 1929\\" may still be seen.

Isabella of Lennox (d.1458) was the ruler of Lennox, from 1437–1458, and last in the line of Mormaers or Native Scottish rulers. As the wife of Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany (d.1425), she was also Duchess of Albany (1420–1425), but in 1425 her family would be almost completely destroyed when her husband, father and two sons were executed by the vengeful King James I of Scotland. Only one son, James the Fat, would escape the King's wrath, and he would die in exile in Ireland soon after. Isabella succeeded in escaping the fate of her family, and would eventually regain her title and estates, retiring to her castle in Loch Lomond where she raised her grandchildren, the children of her youngest son. She would eventually live to see the violent death of her former persecutor, King James. Though none of her four sons survived her, her grandson Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avandale would in time rise to become Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Early life Isabella was the daughter of Donnchadh, Earl of Lennox and Helena, the daughter of Sir Archibald Campbell. Her father Duncan sought to create powerful links with the great Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany, who was the second son of King Robert II by his first wife Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan, and who was to a certain extent the de facto ruler of Scotland, at points during the reigns of his father and elder brother. In 1392, Duncan agreed to marry Isabella to Robert's son, Murdoch Stewart. Murdoch and Isabella did marry, and had at least five children: * Robert (d. 1421) * Walter (d. 1425) * Alasdair (d. 1425) * James/Seamas Mòr (died 1429; some sources say 1449) * Isabel, who married Sir Walter Buchanan, 13th Laird of Buchanan Trial of 1425 Disaster struck Isabella's family when her husband, father, and sons Walter and Alasdair were tried for treason after her other son, James the Fat, raised a rebellion against the king, marched on Dumbarton, burned it, and killed the keeper of the royal castle there, Sir John Stewart of Dundonald, who was the King's uncle, along with the castle garrison. This led a jury composed of 21 knights and Peers to find her husband and two sons guilty of treason for which they were executed. James the Fat escaped the King's justice in 1425, escaping to Antrim, Ireland, where he would spend the rest of his life in exile. Isabella and her daughter survived the results of the rebellion by the Albany Stewarts, which almost obliterated her family, but she was forced to spend eight years as a royal hostage at Tantallon Castle. James died in 1429, prior to an abortive attempt to once again try to steal the throne of Scotland. Confusingly, some sources give his date of death as 1449. 1429 is the most common date given Death of James I Isabella lived to see James I of Scotland assassinated in February 1437 in a failed coup by his kinsman and former ally Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl. Walter Stewart, who had been on the jury that condemned her husband to death for treason also suffered a gruesome death soon afterward. He and his co-conspirators against the King were attainted and put to death in Edinburgh by a series of tortures for regicide. Restoration of her lands and title Soon afterwards, in 1437, Isabella was released from captivity and she recovered her lands and title. In the next few years, although forced to govern her province from her castle at Inchmurrin, Loch Lomond, she issued a large numbers of charters, was popular in the province, and was tolerated by King James II. At some point after she regained her liberty, Isabella brought her young grandchildren, the children of James the Fat, to be raised at her castle at Inchmurrin Isabella was described by Mark Napier, writing in 1835, as being: :\\"reserved and lofty in her demeanor, possessing a strong mind, a calm and indomitable spirit; and no lady of ancient or modern times ever stood more in need of such attributes to sustain her under sudden and violent calamities\\". Death and legacy When Isabella herself died in 1458, having outlived her enemies, the oldest continuous Gaelic mormaerdom came to an end. None of Isabella's four sons outlived her, but her grandchildren by James the Fat did survive. Among them was Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avondale, born in Antrim, Ireland. He became Lord of Avondale in 1459, and Lord Chancellor of Scotland in the same year, becoming one of the leading servants of King James III of Scotland. He would hold the office of Chancellor for 25 years, dying in 1488.Nelker, p.19 Bibliography * Brown, Michael, \\"Earldom and Kindred: The Lennox and Its Earls, 1200-1458\\" in Steve Boardman and Alasdair Ross (eds.)

The show was created by Paul Mendelson who was also credited on another British sitcom May to December. So Haunt Me was produced by Cinema Verity for the BBC and originally aired from 1992 to 1994. Peter Rokeby (played by George Costigan) loses his job as advertising copywriter, and resolves to become a freelance writer. Owing to this change in circumstances, he and his wife Sally (Tessa Peake-Jones) move with their children into a more modest home in Meadow Road, Willesden. The family soon finds that the ghost of a previous owner, Yetta Feldman (Miriam Karlin), still occupies the residence, and has been scaring occupants away for years. Yetta is a stereotypical interfering, middle-aged Jewish mother who died suddenly after choking on a chicken bone. While Sally can both see and speak to their ghost, Peter -- much to his frustration -- initially cannot. The family agrees to help Yetta find her grown-up daughter Carole (\\"Carol-with-an-E\\"). So Haunt Me aired on BBC1 as 18 half-hour episodes in three series and one special from 1992 to 1994.

It was constructed by John de Courcy, sometime near the beginning of the 13th century, following his invasion of Ulster. The castle, built to control access into Lecale from the west and south, stands on the top of a rocky hill commanding fine views south over Dundrum Bay and the Mourne Mountains, the lands west towards Slieve Croob and the plains of Lecale to the east. The Castle is a State Care Historic Monument in the townland of Dundrum, in Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area, at grid ref: J4047 3700. Origins and ownership The castle in 1791 De Courcy's original castle may have had defences of earth and timber, but the stone curtain wall of the upper ward was probably built at the beginning of the 13th century. As with other early enclosure walls, there were no towers, but defence was assisted by covered walks along the outside wall-head. An early timber hall may have been sited near the keep, where there is a double-latrine in the curtain wall. In 1203 de Courcy was expelled from Ulster by Hugh de Lacy. The earliest reference to the castle occurs in the mid 13th century Chronicle of Mann, which records of de Courcy's unsuccessful attempt to siege \\"the castle of Rath\\" in 1205, with the aid of one hundred ships of his brother-in-law, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles.McDonald, RA. Manx kingship in its Irish sea setting, 1187–1229: king Rǫgnvaldr and the Crovan dynasty, p.129. The castle was then captured by King John in 1210. Hugh de Lacy strengthened the castle with a massive round keep, probably employing master masons from the Welsh Marches, where such keeps were then popular. Although much of the second floor of this keep was rebuilt in the 15th century, it is clear from the survival of the old fireplace flue and spiral stair that it originally stood at least three storeys high. The basement was used for storage and had a cistern below the first floor, which appears to have been the great chamber for the lord's day-to-day living, while the floor above would have housed his private chamber. The castle remained Crown property until de Lacy was allowed to return to his Earldom in 1226. It was probably after de Lacy's second tenure as Earl of Ulster (1227–43) that the twin-towered gatehouse, similar to the one at Pembroke Castle, was inserted in the curtain wall. It has a lopsided design with only one projecting tower to protect the approach along a narrow ramp from the south-west. The stone curtain wall of the outer bailey is likely to have been built by the Mac Artáin chiefs of Kinelarty, who owned Dundrum in the late 15th century. At some point after 1333 it was managed by their cousins the Magennis clan, and is sometimes called \\"Magennis Castle\\". The Earl of Kildare briefly captured the castle in 1517 as did Lord Deputy Grey in 1538.. Phelim Magennis Mac Artáin and his son Donal Oge Mac Artáin later surrendered the castle to Lord Mountjoy in 1601. It was made over to Lord Cromwell in 1605 and sold to Sir Francis Blundell in 1636. The Mac Artáin clan were possibly regranted the castle at Dundrum, but later had it repossessed by the Parliamentarians, who dismantled the castle in 1652 after they withdrew their garrison. After 1660 the Blundells returned and built a gabled L-shaped mansion in the south-west corner of the outer bailey. This dwelling was ruined by the time the property passed to the second Marquess of Downshire in the early 19th century, though the trees on the hill were probably planted at this time. The castle and grounds were placed in State Care by the seventh Marquess in 1954. The castle is an important example of Norman architecture, and is a regular destination for tourists and school children. It was the subject of an episode of archaeological television programme Time Team, broadcast on 24 February 2013. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team/episode-guide/series-20/episode-9 Dundrum Castle, Co. Tipperary An unrelated structure called Dundrum Castle existed near Dundrum, County Tipperary and was the family seat of the of O’Dwyers Kilnamanagh, members of the Gaelic aristocracy. Following the invasion of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell and the ill-fated retributive capture of the Rock of Cashel by the last clan chief Philip O'Dwyer, the O'Dwyers lost their properties per the Act of Settlement 1662. Dundrum Castle was destroyed sometime afterwards. In 1730 a mansion known as Dundrum House was built on the site. Dundrum House served as the home of Cornelius Maude, Viscount Hawarden and his descendants until the early 20th century when the structure was sold to an order of Roman Catholic nuns. Transferred to private owners in 1978, Dundrum House now serves as a luxury hotel and golf club.

Plot  Esperanza is a child in Aguascalientes, Mexico, daughter of wealthy landowner Sixto Ortega. She lives on her family's ranch, El Rancho de la Rosas, with her mother, father, and grandmother Abuelita. The day before Esperanza's 13th birthday, her father is murdered on his way to town. Her uncle Tío Luis reveals he now owns their land, as it was not customary to leave property to women. Tío Luis offers to continue to care for them and their ranch on one condition: Esperanza's mother must marry him. When she refuses, he threatens that she will regret her decision. Their ranch later burns down during a fire caused by Tío Luis. Esperanza and her mother have to stay in the servant's quarters with their longtime servants and family friends, Alfonso, Hortensia, and their son Miguel. Abuelita, injured during the fire, is sent to a convent where she can recover. One day Esperanza says to Miguel that they both are on different sides of the river.Tío Luis returns and gives his offer of marriage again, and Esperanza's mother agrees. However, this is a lie as she, Alfonso, and Hortensia plan to flee to the United States. Abuelita cannot accompany them due to her injuries, but promises that she will join them as soon as she is better. Esperanza and what remains of her family travel to the United States. Esperanza has difficulty accepting she's now a \\"peasant\\" and scorns the other poor people traveling alongside them, to her mother's disappointment. They finally arrive safely in the United States, currently in the grip of the Great Depression and settle in a farm camp in Arvin, California with Alfonso's brother Juan, his wife Josefina, and their children, Isabel and twin babies Lupe and Pepe. All the adults work either at the farm camp, picking and packaging produce, or with the nearby railroad companies. Esperanza is too young for a job and instead helps Isabel take care of the babies during the day. Esperanza quickly realizes that she doesn't know how to do practical work, such as washing clothes or even sweeping the floor. She asks for Isabel's help to learn how to care for herself and the young children. She begins to adjust to her new life, but still fantasizes about Abuelita coming with her money and rescuing her from poverty. One day, the camp is caught in a dust storm, and Esperanza's mother contracts Valley fever. She has to be admitted to the hospital and the doctors are unsure if she will survive. Esperanza, desperate for money to support herself and pay her mother's medical bills, takes work on the farm camp despite being underage. She starts to save money after realizing that Abuelita is probably being spied on by Tío Luis and likely can't access her money in Mexico. She stockpiles money orders in the hopes of one day sending them to Abuelita and allowing her to travel to the United States Tensions rise in the camp as migrants from Oklahoma flee the Dust Bowl and look for work in California. They work for less pay and subsequently cost some Mexican immigrants their jobs, including Miguel's job with the railroad company. There are rumors that a camp is being built for Oklahoma migrants (likely based on places like Weedpatch Camp) that will have indoor plumbing, hot water, and even a swimming pool. Strikers from the farm camps insist that the only way to improve conditions in and for all of them is to unify and refuse to work, but many families are afraid of losing their only income and being unable to care for their children. Esperanza continues to work, crossing picket lines because she needs to pay for her mother's hospital stay. Following a massive demonstration by the strikers, the farm owners called immigration officials to round up the demonstrators. As part of the Mexican Repatriation initiative, many of the people deported were natural-born American citizens who had never been to Mexico. Faced with injustice after injustice and the strain of her sick mother, Esperanza has a breakdown and laments the terrible conditions they are subjected to. Miguel insists that things will get better as long as they wait and work hard, but Esperanza doesn't believe there is any hope. They have an argument, with Esperanza insisting that Miguel is \\"still a peasant\\" even in the United States and Miguel dismissing her as \\"still believing [she is] a queen.\\" The next day, they find that Miguel has left to seek work in Northern California. Esperanza's mother finally recovers and is allowed to return home. Esperanza proudly goes to show her mother the money orders she's saved for Abuelita that they could use, only to discover that the money was missing. It's clear Miguel took them when he left. Weeks pass until Miguel's family receives a note asking them to meet him at the train station, and to bring Esperanza. It was revealed he used the money orders to travel to Mexico and retrieve Abuelita in secret as \\"proof that things will get better.\\" The book ends on the day of Esperanza's 14th birthday and Esperanza has finally learned to be grateful for what she does have: her family reunited, friends who love her, and most of all: hope. Esperanza means hope in Spanish. Background information American laborers from Oklahoma were often hostile toward the Mexican workers because they felt they were taking away their jobs. Mexican migrant laborers would work for much lower pay, so there was much tension between the migrant workers on the fields. Some felt that their conditions were unlivable, so they began to protest for better working conditions. Still, others refused to join the protest in fear that they would be fired. In the 1920s and 1930s (about the time the story takes place) California remained about 86% white. Most of these people were those who owned the land, while the 36,800 workers, many of whom were Mexicans, did not. Critical reception Along with its Best Books citation, Publishers Weekly gave Esperanza Rising a starred review, citing its \\"lyrical, fairy tale - like style\\". It praised the way \\"Ryan poetically conveys Esperanza's ties to the land by crafting her story to the rhythms of the seasons\\" and the fact that \\"Ryan fluidly juxtaposes world events... with one family's will to survive\\". Kirkus Reviews disliked the \\"epic tone, characters that develop little and predictably, and... romantic patina\\". However it also found that the \\"style is engaging, her characters appealing\\", ultimately saying that the story \\"bears telling to a wider audience\\". Children's Literature praised Esperanza Rising and suggested that it \\"would be a great choice for a multicultural collection\\". The book has been incorporated into school curriculum in literature, social studies, and Spanish. The University of Missouri has a detailed literature unit available online, including maps, photos and links to other resources. Berkeley High School used recordings of the book with its English as a Second Language students in an Earphone English group. They found that Esperanza Rising doesn't just appeal to students who, like Esperanza, have emigrated from Mexico, but \\"also to those who have moved here after losing their fathers to violence in the former Yugoslavia\\". =Awards= * The 2001 Jane Addams Children's Book Award * The 2001 WILLA Literary Award for Children's/Young Adult Fiction * The 2001 Judy Lopez Memorial Award for Children's Literature * The 2001 Judy Goddard/Libraries Ltd.

Vedder authored numerous articles and twenty-seven books on church history and theology. Early life and education Vedder was born in De Ruyter, New York. He graduated from the University of Rochester with an A.B. in 1873, an A.M. in 1876 and a D.D. in 1897. He also graduated from the Rochester Theological Seminary in 1876. In 1894, Vedder accepted ordination into the Baptist ministry. Career He was an editor at the New York Baptist newspaper Examiner from 1876 to 1894 and the Baptist Quarterly Review from 1929 to 1935. In 1894, he became professor of church history at Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania and served in that capacity until 1926. After his retirement from the Crozer Theological Seminary, Vedder joined the editorial staff of the Chester Times newspaper in Chester, Pennsylvania. In addition to numerous articles, Vedder authored twenty-seven books. Vedder shifted from orthodoxy to evangelical liberalism and became the subject of criticism by fundamentalists in the 1920s. Between 1908 and 1912 Vedder began to embrace socialism, evolution and pragmatism, a new interpretation of the atonement, and salvation as both individual and social. Vedder joined \\"social gospel\\" efforts with theologian Walter Rauschenbusch. Vedder was a member of the American Society of Church History. Personal life Vedder was married to Minnie Lingham Vedder and together they had a son Edward Bright Vedder who became a U.S. Army physician and noted researcher of beriberi. Vedder died in Chester Hospital and is interred at the Chester Rural Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania. Four generations of Vedders have attended the University of Rochester including Henry Clay Vedder's son, Edward Bright Vedder who graduated in 1898, his grandson Henry Clay Vedder II attended the school before graduating from George Washington University and his great grandson, Henry Clay Vedder III graduated in 1998.

The Jepson Manual. of perennial herbs native to western North America; its common names include biscuitroot, Indian parsley, and desert parsley. It is in the family Apiaceae and therefore related to many familiar edible species such as carrots and celery; some Lomatium species were extensively used by Native Americans in the inland Northwest as a staple food. Description Roots range from woody taproots to more fleshy underground tuberous-thickened roots. Most lomatiums are desert species or grow on bluffs where water is limited for most of the year. They are green and grow the most during the spring when water is available, then set seed and dry out completely above ground before the hottest part of the year, while storing the energy they gained from photosynthesizing while water was available to them in their deep roots. For most of the year, the plant is not visible; the brown tops often are blown off or easily crushed, but it lies dormant underground for the next spring. The flowers are arranged in compound umbels, without involucral bracts (or with inconspicuous bracts). The flowers are white or yellow, more rarely a purple or maroon color. As with most Apiaceae, the fruit sets the genus apart from other yellow- or white-flowered look-alikes such as Cymopterus and Oreogenia. Uniquely, they are dorsally flattened and winged, which can be papery or corky, but help the seed to disperse further on the wind. The dorsal ribs may or may not be on the fruit, but are narrowly winged if at all. Leaves are mainly basal and dissected (ternately, pinnately, or ternate-pinnately dissected or compound), many look like ferns or can be mistaken for them. Ecology It grows in a variety of habitats throughout western North America, from coastal bluffs to piles of basalt rock. Conservation concerns Many species' habitats are under threat by grazing, development, and wildfires. Also, some concern exists about particular species such as L. dissectum, which is mainly harvested from the wild for herbal uses. Because the genus is so difficult to identify, but has great genetic diversity, new species are still being found today such as L. tarantuloides, many species often have a very limited range, they exist nowhere else, and are few to begin with. Cultivation and uses Several species, including L. cous, L. geyeri, and L. macrocarpum, are sometimes known as biscuit roots for their starchy edible roots. These are or have been traditional Native American foods, eaten cooked or dried and ground into flour. Some Native Americans ground Lomatium into mush and shaped it into cakes and stored them for later use. Their flavor has been compared to celery, parsnip, or stale biscuits.

It was named after the Haring family, who were early settlers to the region. The spelling was originally \\"Harington Township\\", based on the family name \\"Haring\\", but was changed to \\"Harrington\\" in the latter part of the 19th century. Harrington Township was formed by Royal Charter on June 22, 1775, and was created from the northern portions of both New Barbadoes Township and Hackensack Township.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 79. The new township stretched from the Hudson River on the east to the Saddle River in the west, and north to the New York border. On April 13, 1840, the territories west of the Hackensack River were taken from Harrington Township to form Washington Township. The passage of a revised Borough Act resulted in the \\"Boroughitis\\"-inspired subdivision of the township into new municipalities: Delford (now Oradell) on March 8, 1894; Eastwood (part, borough lasted until 1896 to become part of Old Tappan) on June 6, 1894; Schraalenburgh (now Dumont) on July 20, 1894; and Old Tappan on October 8, 1894. Portions of Harrington Township were taken on April 8, 1903, to form parts of both Demarest and Alpine. The final wave of departures saw the creation of Closter (January 1, 1904), Haworth (February 24, 1904), Harrington Park (March 29, 1904) and Norwood (March 14, 1905). On March 15, 1916, the remainder of Harrington Township became Northvale. With the creation of Northvale, Harrington Township was dissolved. References  Sources  *Westervelt, Frances A.

At the 2006 census, its population was 4,746, in 875 families. Alternate spellings include: Assalouyeh, Asalouyeh, Asalouyeh, Asaluyeh, Asaloyeh, Asalooyeh, Asaluye, Assaluyeh, Asalu. UNCTAD codes: IR YEH, IR PGU, IR ASA. Located on the shore of the Persian Gulf some 270 km SE of the provincial capital of Bushehr, it is best known as the site for the land based facilities of the huge PSEEZ (Pars Special Energy Economic Zone) project. The town itself is of minor significance, although it is common practice to refer to PSEEZ (established 1998) and Asaluyeh town collectively as Asaluyeh. Asalouyeh was chosen as the site of the PSEEZ facilities due to it being the closest land point to the largest natural gas field in the world, the South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field. In addition, an existing airport and direct access to international waters via a deep water port were already present.Location iranasalouyeh.com PSEEZ The PSEEZ (Pars Special Energy/Economic Zone) as it is known has been allocated 100 square kilometres of land at Asaluyeh for the various complexes and facilities. The site is a collection of different plants and refineries (known as \\"phases\\") and is administered by the PSEEZ agency onsite. A total of 27 phases are envisaged (12 gas, 15 petrochemical), plus a mix of light and heavy industry, and associated support facilities such as factories and warehouses. The scale of the project is huge. Some 28 refineries and 25 petrochemical complexes are scheduled to be established in Asalouyeh, in southern Bushehr province. Of these, 10 refineries and 7 petrochemical complexes were already operational in 2009.http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3463/html/economy.htm PSEEZ is a workers town - tourism is non-existent. Currently there are no hotels in Assalouyeh, although plans exist to construct a hotel between the airport and the Industrial area. Once completed, the Sadaf International Hotel will consist of 400 rooms in three buildings, on 1 square kilometre of land. A visa is required to enter Iran for most nationalities, and is therefore needed to visit the PSEEZ. The only exception to the visa requirement is if you visit Kish Island, which allows visitors to enter visa-free. As of August 2005, US$20 billion of foreign money had been invested in PSEEZ since 1997. According to Iran's oil ministry, sales of products from PSEEZ could be as much as $11 billion per year, over 30 years. Private companies are also constructing a business park and warehouses. Internet access and telephony facilities are also available via a Tehran based Internet Service Provider, Pars Online. No other ISP's are present at PSEEZ. In 2010, a large power plant with 1,000 megawatts output was inaugurated in Asalouyeh, aiming to supply electricity to the refineries of South Pars gas field phases 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 18. =Special economic zone= Pars Especial Economic Zone The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) is a special economic zone. PSEEZ was established in 1998 for the utilization of South Pars oil and gas resources. Goods can be brought in duty-free, but cannot leave the PSEEZ and enter the rest of Iran. This is to encourage construction within and development of the PSEEZ. The private sector has invested some $1.5 billion in the PSEEZ during the past 4 years (2009). Foreign entities have invested some $36 billion in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) during the past 10 years (2009). Asalouyeh City Asalouyeh city is surrounded by PSEEZ, but is still geographically separate and a few minutes drive from the nearest PSEEZ facility. Before the arrival of PSEEZ, the primary industry was fishing, albeit a very small one. Asalouyeh was a sleepy coastal hamlet, on a narrow strip of land between the Persian Gulf and the Zagros Mountains. Poverty existed in the small town, and it remains. Today it is the most knows akak shops. In 2006 part of the town's seafront was given a promenade with some landscaping and decoration. Construction The PSEEZ is one of the busiest ongoing construction sites in the world. At any one time up to 60,000 workers are onsite, mostly employed in construction of further gas and petrochemical refineries. Airport Construction of a new airport began in 2003. The new Persian Gulf International Airport (IATA code: YEH) opened to traffic in July 2006, replacing the original temporary airport. The volume of construction works for facilities such as runways and aircraft parking area, fence, and patrol roads and access routes to the airport's boulevard, construction of terminals with Jetways to handle 750,000 passengers per year. Control tower and technical buildings as well as supporting buildings such as fire station, meteorology section and so on have been started. Airport characteristics are the runway with length of 4000 meters asphalt paved, width of 45 meters with two 7.5m shoulders along the runway. Aircraft parking area is 330 × 150 Sqm concrete paved. Airport area and peripheral buildings will be constructed on 18 hectares of land. Iranian specialists are undertaking execution works for this airport and installation of the airport's navigation and lighting systems will be performed by foreign companies. Pars-Port Complex Logistic Port: Logistic port covers 150 hectares: The western breakwater is 2300 meters long and the eastern breakwater is 1000 meters long. The port basin is 100 hectares with capacity to accept ships of up to 80,000 tons deadweight. The nominal capacity of this port is 10 million tons per year including 1 million tons of granulated sulphur, 3 million of container products and 6 million tons of refinery machinery and parts. This port will have at least 10 berths that can simultaneously accommodate 10 ships and especially for exporting of sulphur, containers loading / unloading as heavy cargo. Water drought along the berths is at least 11 meters and at most 15 meters and the jetty in this port is 2600 meters long. At present, 5 berths are operational. All of the equipment needed by refineries and petrochemical industries were unloaded in this very port and installed on sites. Petrochemical Port: The petrochemical port with 15 berths and draught of 15 meters can accommodate ships of capacity 80,000 tons deadweight that especially carry gas and petrochemical products. The nominal capacity of this port is 35 million tons per year and it is predicted that 26 million tons of petrochemical products in liquid from will be exported through this port. In accordance with the operations time schedule for the Zone's petrochemical projects, execution operations on this port will be completed in three phases; phase 1 will be completed by 2005 and the project's completion date will be year 2006. Plants and Refineries Each of the phases of the South Pars project is estimated to have an average capital spend of around US$1.5bn, and most will be led by foreign oil firms working in partnership with local companies. The government of President Ahmadinejad, who came to power in 2005, has favoured local firms over foreign companies in the energy and other sectors. In 2010, Iran awarded $21 billion of contracts to local companies to develop six stages (phases 13, 14, 19, 22, 23 and 24) of the South Pars gas field.http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-15/iranian-companies- win-21-billion-in-gas-contracts-update1-.html Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters, the engineering arm of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, is part of the domestic group, as is Oil Industries Engineering and Construction and Iran Marine Industrial Co. The group also includes Iran Shipbuilding and Offshore Industries Complex Co., Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and National Iranian Drilling Co. Managing the projects by Iranian companies does not rule out the participation of foreign firms in South Pars projects. Any visitor to Asaluyeh will immediately notice the series of Gas and Petrochemical complexes running along the coast, one of the largest collection of such facilities in the world. The various plants and complexes currently run for some 12 km, and more are being constructed. A series of gas flares which line the facility are immediately obvious, including one enormous flare in particular, with flames of almost 100 m in height. This flare is visible far out to sea. The area also hosts the world's largest aromatic production plant, Noori Petrochemical Complex, with an annual capacity of 4.2 million tons. Once completed, South Pars development revenue will exceed current oil exports incomes. Gas production at South Pars rose by nearly 30 per cent between March 2009 and March 2010. The field's reserves are estimated at 14 trillion cubic meters of gas and of gas condensates. Production at South Pars gas field will rise to 175 million cubic meters per day in 2012. =Project phases= South Pars construction phases. *Phase 1 was developed by Petropars to produce per day of natural gas, per day of condensate, 1500 tons of LPG per day plus 200 tons of sulfur per day. *Phases 2 and 3 were developed by a consortium of Total S.A., Petronas, and Gazprom to produce per day of natural gas, per day of condensate, 3000 tons of LPG per day plus 400 tons of sulfur per day. It came online in March 2003. *Phases 4 and 5 were developed by Eni and Petropars, to produce per day of rich natural gas, per day of ethane, per day of condensate, 3000 tons of LPG per day plus 400 tons of sulfur per day. *Phases 6 to 8 being developed by Petropars and Statoil to produce lean gas for re-injection into the Aghajari oilfield, and heavy gas and condensate for export. It involves construction of three offshore platforms in addition to the land-based facilities. Statoil is developing the offshore platforms while Petropars is developing the land based facilities. A 31-inch (790 mm) pipe will be laid from each platform to the coast. These phases will produce per day of natural gas, per day of ethane, per day of condensate, 4500 Tons of LPG per day plus 600 tons of sulfur per day. *Phases 9 and 10 was assigned to a consortium of Oil Industrial Engineering and Construction Company (OIEC) and LG Company. These phases will produce per day of natural gas, per day of ethane, per day of condensate, 3000 tons of LPG per day plus 400 tons of sulfur per day. Phases 9 & 10 were inaugurated by President Ahmadinejad on March 2009. *Phases 11 will produce LNG through the Pars LNG project. The project was awarded to China National Petroleum Corporation in 2010 after that France's Total S.A. was excluded from the project by Iran. *Phases 12 development begin carried out by Petropars as a LNG project. This phase will produce per day of rich natural gas, per day of ethane, per day of condensate, 3000 tons of LPG per day plus 400 tons of sulfur per day. Venezuela’s state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) will finance 10 percent of the 7.8-billion-dollar project. Angola’s Sonangol Group has also been awarded a 20 percent stake in phase 12 project. *Phase 13 and 14 development will be for Persian LNG production. Development was awarded to an Iranian company (Khatam-ol-Osea) for $5 billion. The Iranian Khatam-ol-Osea Consortium is made up of several large Iranian companies, namely Khatam al-Anbia Construction Headquarters, Oil Industries Engineering & Construction (OIEC), SADRA, ISOICO, IDRO, and NIDC. The contract to develop phase 13 was signed with a consortium comprising Mapna, SADRA, and Petro Pidar Iranian companies and the phase 14 with another consortia consisting of Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO), National Iranian Drilling Company (NIDC) and Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Company (IOEC). Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol had been originally awarded phases 13 and 14 but were left out of the project by Iran due to their repeated delays. *Phases 15 and 16 development was awarded to Khatam al-Anbia. These phases will produce per day of natural gas, per day of ethane, per day of condensate, 3000 tons of LPG per day plus 400 tons of sulfur per day. In July 2010, the project was transferred to Iran Shipbuilding & Offshore Industries Complex. At that time, the 2 billion dollars project was already 50% complete. Phase 15 & 16 will be completed by March 2012. *Phases 17 and 18 development was assigned to a consortium of Industrial Project Management of Iran (IPMI), Oil Industrial Engineering and Construction Company (OIEC), Iran Offshore Engineering and Construction (IOEC) and Petropars.

South Pars Gas Field The field is located in the Persian Gulf. The field is the biggest gas field in the world, shared between Iran and Qatar, which contains gas in place and of condensate in place in both parts. The South Pars Field is the name of northern part, which is located in Iranian waters and the North Dome is the name of southern part, which is located in Qatari waters. South Pars Field was discovered in 1990 by NIOC. Production started from the southern extension of the field, the North Dome in 1989, at daily gas production rate of per day at standard conditions. Gas production started from South Pars field by commissioning the development phase 2 in December 2002 to produce per day at standard conditions of wet gas. The field consists of two independent gas- bearing formations, Kangan and Upper Dalan. Each formation is divided into two different reservoir layers, separated by impermeable barriers. Therefore, the field consists of four independent reservoir layers K1, K2, K3, and K4. Iranian sections contains of gas in place and around of recoverable gas. It covers an area of and is located 3 km below the seabed at a water depth of 65 m. The Iranian side accounts for 10% of the world's and 60% of Iran's total gas reserves. The field is planned to be developed in around 30 phases, each of which will require an initial investment of around $1bn. Downstream Industries Due to the availability of Petrochemicals and their by-products, 10 square kilometres at PSEEZ has been allocated for related industries, such as:www.iranasalouyeh.com * Resins & Adhesives * Rubber & Plastics * Synthetic fibers & textiles * Oils * Fertilizers * Polymers * Paints & Protective Coatings * Pesticides * Detergents Water supply project Construction of two water desalination plants each with a capacity of 10,000 cubic per day started in March 2005. The project was finished 10 months ahead of its contractual 16 months estimate, making it a landmark in project execution in the region. The creation of a network for transferring water distribution network in different sites is underway. Green space and environment In view of the Zone's policy on environmental protection and alleviation of industrial pollutions, first steps have been taken in the form of 1000 hectares of urban green space and 3000 hectares allocated to forestation and expansion of the mangrove trees in the tidal area of the sea. In this way, 10% of the total industrial site and 28% of the entire Zone will be transformed into green space. Foreign involvement Individual gas and petrochemical plants at Asoluyeh, when constructed, usually involve a partnership with a foreign company. The government of President Ahmadinejad, who came to power in 2005, has favoured local firms over foreign companies in the energy and other sectors. Due to the embargo in place against Iran by the United States, it is mostly European and Asian companies becoming involved. These include: * China National Petroleum Corporation * Daelim * Eni (formerly known as Agip) * Gazprom * Hyundai Engineering and Construction (with Linde Group) * Japan Gasoline Company (JGC) - involved in the construction of the world's largest gas refinery. * LG * Petronas * Statoil * Technip * Total * Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) However, the US company Halliburton and American Allied International Corporation, have contracts for and business dealing with South Pars via subsidiaries. Plans for LNG refining and export have been discussed - but it remains to be seen how this will be accomplished, as most LNG refining technology is US based and therefore subject to export control due to US sanctions.

J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846-1848, New York: Macmillan, Background Commodore David Conner of the Home Squadron, received orders from Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft to \\"exercise all the rights that belong to you as commander-in-chief of a belligerent squadron\\" in establishing a blockade of the Mexican east coast. On 14 May 1846, Conner established his base at Anton Lizardo, Veracruz and placed Veracruz, Alvarado, Tampico, and Matamoros under blockade. Commodore Matthew C. Perry was named as Conner's replacement in the fall of 1846, and suggested capturing \\"Tabasco\\", otherwise known as San Juan Bautista along the Tabasco River. On 16 Oct., Perry left Anton Lizardo with the steamboats Mississippi, Vixen and McLane and the schooners Reefer, Bonita, Nonata, and Forward. On 23 Oct., Perry captured Frontera and moved upriver, finding Tabasco the next morning at 9 AM. Battle Lt. Col. Juan B. Traconis withdrew his 700 men from the town allowing Perry to occupy the town by 5 PM, capturing five Mexican vessels. However, at night, Perry recalled his landing party and Traconis's forces returned to the city, barricading themselves inside buildings. Traconis received a delegation of U.S. Marines who requested their surrender, but responded \\"Tell Commodore Perry that I would sooner die with my garrison before handing over this place.\\" Perry realized that a bombardment of the city was the only option to drive out the Mexican troops, but would harm noncombatants, so he decided to retreat to Frontera with his prizes. On the morning of October 26, the Mexicans started firing on Perry's ships who replied in kind. As the U.S. troops began to bombard the town, the flagpole of the Mexican headquarters was shot through and fell. The Americans, believing that this signalled a surrender, stopped firing and sent a delegation to investigate, receiving the same answer as before from Traconis, who then fixed the flagpole to the tower of the Church, and the battle recommenced, continuing until evening. The foreign merchants asked for a ceasefire, which Perry complied with, but when one of his prizes was grounded and then fired upon, Perry once again returned fire, while continuing on to Frontera. Aftermath Perry managed to only establish a naval blockade with the McLane and Forward. after many preceding failures.

Like Steele Creek, Mountain Island was once largely its own township but nowadays has largely either been annexed or closely integrated to Charlotte. Mountain Island is named for a small island in Mountain Island Lake, on the border of Gaston and Mecklenburg counties. Located on the extreme southwestern end of the lake, the island is mainly used as an anchor point for recreation, picnicking, and camping. A cotton mill, said by some authorities to be the first in Gaston County, was established on Mountain Island in 1848 by Thomas R. Tate and Henry Humphreys, owners of the Mount Hecla steam-powered mill near Greensboro, North Carolina. They hoped to take advantage of the less expensive water power from the Catawba River. The site at river’s edge featured a partially completed canal around the shoals that could be used for a mill race, and a steep island whose top now rises from the lake. Machinery was moved from the Mount Hecla mill by mule-drawn wagon and operations began in 1849. A village of brick houses grew around the mill.

Orange and green trajectories are for small and large Stokes numbers, respectively. Orange curve is trajectory of particle with Stokes number less than one that follows the streamlines (blue), while green curve is for a Stokes number greater than one, and so the particle does not follow the streamlines. That particle collides with one of the obstacles (brown circles) at point shown in yellow. The Stokes number (Stk), named after George Gabriel Stokes, is a dimensionless number characterising the behavior of particles suspended in a fluid flow. The Stokes number is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of a particle (or droplet) to a characteristic time of the flow or of an obstacle, or :\\\\mathrm{Stk} = \\\\frac{t_0 \\\\,u_0}{l_0} where t_0 is the relaxation time of the particle (the time constant in the exponential decay of the particle velocity due to drag), u_0 is the fluid velocity of the flow well away from the obstacle and l_0 is the characteristic dimension of the obstacle (typically its diameter). A particle with a low Stokes number follows fluid streamlines (perfect advection), while a particle with a large Stokes number is dominated by its inertia and continues along its initial trajectory. In the case of Stokes flow, which is when the particle (or droplet) Reynolds number is less than unity, the particle drag coefficient is inversely proportional to the Reynolds number itself. In that case, the characteristic time of the particle can be written as : t_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \\\\mu_g} where \\\\rho_p is the particle density, d_p is the particle diameter and \\\\mu_g is the gas dynamic viscosity. In experimental fluid dynamics, the Stokes number is a measure of flow tracer fidelity in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments where very small particles are entrained in turbulent flows and optically observed to determine the speed and direction of fluid movement (also known as the velocity field of the fluid). For acceptable tracing accuracy, the particle response time should be faster than the smallest time scale of the flow. Smaller Stokes numbers represent better tracing accuracy; for \\\\mathrm{Stk} \\\\gg 1, particles will detach from a flow especially where the flow decelerates abruptly. For \\\\mathrm{Stk} \\\\ll1, particles follow fluid streamlines closely. If \\\\mathrm{Stk} < 0.1, tracing accuracy errors are below 1%.  Non-Stokesian drag regime  The preceding analysis will not be accurate in the ultra- Stokesian regime. i.e. if the particle Reynolds number is much greater than unity. Assuming a Mach number much less than unity, a generalized form of the Stokes number was demonstrated by Israel & Rosner. \\\\text{Stk}_\\\\text{e} = \\\\text{Stk} \\\\frac{24}{\\\\text{Re}_{o}} \\\\int^{\\\\text{Re}_{o}}_0 \\\\frac{d \\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}}{C_D(\\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}} Where \\\\text{Re}_ois the \\"particle free-stream Reynolds number\\", \\\\text{Re}_o = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_g \\\\mathbf{u} d_p}{\\\\mu_g} An additional function \\\\psi(\\\\text{Re}_{o}) was defined by, this describes the non-Stokesian drag correction factor, \\\\text{Stk}_{e} = \\\\text{Stk} \\\\cdot \\\\psi (\\\\text{Re}_{o}) It follows that this function is defined by, \\\\psi describes the non-Stokesian drag correction factor for a spherical particle \\\\psi (\\\\text{Re}_{o}) = \\\\frac{24}{\\\\text{Re}_{o}} \\\\int^{\\\\text{Re}_{o}}_0 \\\\frac{d \\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}}{C_D(\\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\text{Re}^{\\\\prime}} Considering the limiting particle free-stream Reynolds numbers, as \\\\text{Re}_{o}\\\\rightarrow0 then C_D(\\\\text{Re}_{o})\\\\rightarrow 24/\\\\text{Re}_{o} and therefore \\\\psi \\\\rightarrow 1 . Thus as expected there correction factor is unity in the Stokesian drag regime. Wessel & Righi evaluated \\\\psi for C_D(\\\\text{Re}) from the empirical correlation for drag on a sphere from Schiller & Naumann. \\\\psi(\\\\text{Re}_{o}) = \\\\frac{3(\\\\sqrt{c}\\\\text{Re}_{o}^{1/3}-\\\\arctan(\\\\sqrt{c}\\\\text{Re}_{o}^{1/3}))}{c^{3/2}\\\\text{Re}_{o}} Where the constant c=0.158. The conventional Stokes number will significantly underestimate the drag force for large particle free-stream Reynolds numbers. Thus overestimating the tendency for particles to depart from the fluid flow direction. This will lead to errors in subsequent calculations or experimental comparisons.  Application to anisokinetic sampling of particles  For example, the selective capture of particles by an aligned, thin-walled circular nozzle is given by Belyaev and Levin as: :c / c_0 = 1 + (u_{0} / u -1) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\mathrm{Stk} (2 + 0.617 u / u_{0})}\\\\right) where c is particle concentration, u is speed, and the subscript 0 indicates conditions far upstream of the nozzle. The characteristic distance is the diameter of the nozzle. Here the Stokes number is calculated, :\\\\mathrm{Stk} = \\\\frac{u_{0} V_{s}}{d g} where V_{s} is the particle's settling velocity, d is the sampling tubes inner diameter, and g is the acceleration of gravity.

It was named after Robert Baden-Powell, Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the world Scouting Movement.  Geography  The trail is about forty-eight kilometres (48 km) long, extending (west to east) from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver to Deep Cove in the District of North Vancouver. In between, the trail winds through the heavily forested North Shore Mountains. It also connects with several other local trails.  Points of interest  There are a number of scenic vistas and points of interest along the way. These include: * the summit of Black Mountain (1217m) * Hollyburn Mountain Old-Growth forest. * crossing the Capilano River by way of the Cleveland Dam * the Grouse Grind, a challenging fitness venue on Grouse Mountain (closed November- April) * the famous Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge in Lynn Canyon Park * a section along Lynn Creek * a narrow bridge crossing the Seymour Canyon * the Quarry Rock lookout in Deep Cove * a view of nearly all of Vancouver from \\"Eagle Bluff,\\" near Cypress Provincial Park.  Identifying the trail  A signpost on the Baden Powell Trail. The trail is marked with bright orange triangular tags that are attached to trees alongside the trail and some blue directional signage. In addition, regular signposts indicate directions and provide distance measurements. A number of stairways and bridges are installed along the trail to make it passable in steep, difficult, or dangerous terrain. However, the trail surface is not completely clear; there are many obstacles such as exposed roots, large rocks, and massive mud puddles. Some sections of the trail are especially steep and can feel somewhat exposed.  Construction  The trail was constructed in 1971 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of British Columbia's entry into Canada as a province. The project was initiated by the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides organizations of B.C. and much of the work of building it was done by their young members.  Events  Every year, an extremely demanding cross-country trail running race known as the Knee Knackering North Shore Trail Run (or Knee Knacker) is conducted along the full length of the Baden-Powell Trail.  Access  The trail has many access points throughout its entirety. On the West end, the trail starts where Highway 99 (Sea-To-Sky) and Highway 1 diverge, however there is very limited parking at this location. At the East end, the trail starts in Panorama Park, north of the heart of Deep Cove.

It is a three-storey Tower house named after its 16th century owner, John Audley. Audley's Castle tower house and bawn is a State Care Historic Monument in the townland of Castleward, in Down District Council area, at grid ref: J5781 5058. There are thousands of small stone towers similar to Audley's Castle in the Irish countryside. They are one of the commonest of archaeological sites, which indicates these were not buildings put up for the higher aristocracy, but for lesser lords and gentry. Most were built in the late Middle Ages (roughly 1350–1550). Audley's was built towards the end of this period. Features Audley's Castle consists of a tower set within a yard (technically known as a bawn) which is enclosed by a thin wall, with a simple gate. It is protected on its south side by a rocky cliff. The stone walls of the bawn have been reduced to low foundations, but its rectangular plan can still be traced. In the south-east area of the bawn are the foundations of an outhouse, probably a barn or servants quarters, and the tower house is at the north corner of the bawn. The south-east face of the tower house is dominated by two projecting square turrets, linked by an arch at parapet level (a machicolation), through which objects could be dropped on anyone attacking the door in the south turret below. The ground floor room is entered through a small lobby which has a murder-hole in its roof. The room is lit by narrow window loops and has a wall cupboard and a chute for slops. The south turret contains a spiral stair which leads to the two upper chambers and the roof. The first floor chamber has a semicircular barrel vault, designed as a defence against the spread of fire. A number of beam sockets and projecting stone corbels in the walls show how the vault was erected. The presence of window seats, a fireplace, two cupboards and a latrine (in the east turret) suggest that the first floor chamber was the main living room in the castle. The second floor chamber lacks a fireplace, but does have window seats and a latrine in the east turret and could have been a sleeping area. Above this floor is the roof level with a wall-walk behind a parapet and higher corner turrets, now largely demolished. The castle had a pitched roof as a drawing from 1840 shows a gable wall in place which later collapsed. the timber roof of the castle would have been covered with slates, wooden shingles, stone slabs or thatch. The tower has one main room on each floor, with one or two subsidiary rooms off each of the big ones. The ground floor has small windows and no fireplace or latrine and was for storage of provisions. The first floor has better windows, a large fireplace and access to a latrine; this was a room for the owner to live in and entertain his friends. It also has a chute for throwing dirty water away, so the large fireplace was also probably used for cooking on. The second floor was probably the lord's private room for sleeping and his family life: servants and others could be accommodated in the attic. A spiral stair leads to the first and second floor rooms and the roof. The first floor room has a reconstructed wooden floor and semicircular stone barrel vault. There is very little historical information about the buildings in the small courtyard around Audley's. Only a minority of towers had courtyard walls at all, and their buildings were clearly less important than the tower. The towers in different parts of the country vary, with distinct regional patterns. Audley's with its two turrets linked by an arch is one of a type found in County Down only. History The castle is probably of 15th century date, but its early history is unknown. The castle is named after its late 16th century owners, the Audleys, a Hiberno-Norman family who held land in the area in the 13th century, although it is not known if they built the castle. It was sold, with the surrounding estate, to the Ward family in 1646 and used in 1738 as an eye-catching focus of the long vista along Castle Ward's artificial lake, Temple Water.

He is best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist of rock band Blue October. He is also a member of the band Harvard of the South. Personal life When not touring with his band, Furstenfeld resides in San Marcos, Texas. He is the brother of Blue October drummer Jeremy Furstenfeld. He has a daughter named Blue Reed Furstenfeld, to whom he dedicated the album Any Man in America. Blue, and Furstenfeld's relationship with her mother, are the subject matter of much of the album. On June 13, 2012, Furstenfeld proposed to his pregnant girlfriend Sarah. On July 28, 2012, they were married in a private ceremony in Wimberley, Texas. Together they have a daughter named Sayde Belle, born August 23, 2012. On April 2nd, 2016, Furstenfeld and his wife had a son, Gunner Black. Music career Growing up, Furstenfeld listened to hip-hop, rock, country, dance; his favorite artists included Idaho, Marvin Gaye, The Smiths, Peter Gabriel, Red House Painters, The Cure, Cocteau Twins, Bauhaus, and Pink Floyd. His first musical memory was Roy Orbison's ballad, \\"Crying\\". During his high school years at Houston's prestigious High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA), he formed the band The Last Wish, which he played in from the age of 13 until 1995. When performing solo, Furstenfeld uses the moniker 5591, the number 5591 being his patient number when he was admitted to a mental institution following a breakup with his then-girlfriend Amanda. He tells this story in the confessionals on the Argue With a Tree DVD (found in the Special Features). He has written over 500 songs and counts among his influences: Michael Stipe, The Cure, The Smiths, The Pixies, Peter Gabriel, Idaho, Elliott Smith, Blue Miller, George Winston, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and U2. Furstenfeld also co- wrote and performed guest vocals on the Canvas song \\"All About You\\" from their album Four Days Awake. He also sings on the song \\"Medusa\\" on Tarja Turunen's album Colours in the Dark. In 2014, he provided guest vocals on Zeale's song \\"Invisible Prisons\\", and also sang on the song \\"When We Were Made\\" on Paco Estrada's 2015 album Bedtime Stories. In August 2008, Furstenfeld toured with Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series, in a sold out four-city book/concert tour. On October 22, 2009, the Pick Up the Phone Tour was cancelled after Furstenfeld was admitted to a hospital for an extreme anxiety attack, though the band still played two November dates in Austin. Furstenfeld wrote the song \\"Softspot\\" on The Meeting Place's 2019 album Haunt. = Musical style = Furstenfeld's vocal and performance style has been likened to Peter Gabriel, Genesis and \\"Fish\\" of Marillion. Personal life =Writing= In April 2009, Furstenfeld published the book Crazy Making – The Words and Lyrics of Justin Furstenfeld, in which he goes into explicit detail about the inspiration behind each and every Blue October song to date. =Painting= Furstenfeld's paintings have appeared on the covers of two Blue October albums, The Answers and History for Sale. His artwork is also featured on T-shirts and posters for the band.

History  The club was founded as Rixdorfer TuFC Tasmania1900 on 2 June 1900. It is believed the founders of the club were about to migrate to Australia at the end of the 19th century, so they named their club after their shared desired destination Tasmania. In 1965, Berlin's only Bundesliga side, Hertha BSC, had its license revoked and was relegated for breaking the league's player salary rules. The German Football Association wanted to keep a club in the city of Berlin for political reasons and this led to one of the strangest episodes in the Bundesliga's history. Both Karlsruher SC and FC Schalke 04 tried to avoid being demoted by laying claim to Hertha's place. It was decided to suspend relegation for one season and increase the number of teams in the league from 16 to 18 to accommodate the two teams which would normally be promoted from the Regionalligen (the Regional Leagues being the leagues below the Bundesliga at the time). Cold War politics led to a space being held for a team from the former capital city to replace Hertha. The winner of Regionalliga Berlin, Tennis Borussia Berlin, had failed to advance to the Bundesliga through the regular promotion round that saw Bayern Munich and Borussia Mönchengladbach move up. After the Regionalliga second- place finisher, Spandauer SV, refused an offer of promotion, the way was clear for third-place club Tasmania 1900 to take up the opportunity to represent Berlin in the Bundesliga — just two weeks before the start of the 1965–66 season. A top performer in the relatively weak Regionalliga Berlin, Tasmania 1900 would find themselves seriously overmatched in the Bundesliga. Despite a season-opening 2–0 win over Karlsruher SC at the Olympiastadion, they would go on to become the worst team in league history — in a 34-game season they won only twice. They scored only 15 goals while conceding 108 and finished the season in last place earning just 8 of a possible 68 points. The only team not to beat Tasmania was 1. FC Kaiserslautern which managed only two draws (0–0 and 1–1) against them. The 0–0 result at Betzenberg was the only point earned by Tasmania away from their home stadium. Tasmania were relegated at the end of the season and returned to the Regionalliga Berlin. Although the team made it to the promotion round twice between 1966 and 1973, they never managed a return to the Bundesliga. In 1973, the Neukölln sports association declared bankruptcy. = SV Tasmania Berlin = A successor team, SC Tasmania 73 Neukölln was created, becoming SV Tasmania-Gropiusstadt 1973 in 2000. While the new club's first team had to restart in the lowest division in 1973 and quickly rose through the ranks again, the club's youth teams were permitted to remain in the leagues they played in under the old name. Since 2011, the club has been known as SV Tasmania Berlin.

Official product site while others require the open space needed for larger models due to size and/or speed. Because of their size and relative ease of setup, ready-to-fly park flyers are among the most popular class of RC aircraft for beginners and advanced pilots alike. Advanced electronic and material technologies have even brought forth high-performance, park flyer sized \\"3D-flyers\\", or fully aerobatic aircraft capable of extreme high g manoeuvres and even nose-up hovering. Once the exclusive realm of giant scale, 3D flight is now possible both indoors and out with certain park flyer aircraft. Park flyers have created an inexpensive and convenient way for beginners to get involved in the hobby of RC flight. The modern materials used in the simple construction of these aircraft make field repairs possible even after significant crash damage. Their small size and quiet operation make it possible to fly them in residential areas. It is advisable to first learn how to fly at a club, and that way individuals have a better ability to assess suitable flying locations if wishing to fly at their local park. A parkflyer called the SQuiRT has been named \\"America's parkflyer\\" due to its travels around the United States of America traveling over 26,000 miles and being flown by over 700 different pilots. This is known as the Wings Across America 2008 adventure. The trade-off is that a model with low flying speed is more susceptible to wind and turbulence. Some park flyers cannot be flown in anything more than a light breeze: typically a wind speed of > 50% of the flying speed is the limit (although experienced pilots may enjoy flying with a negative ground speed). A note on safety: some 'park flyers' (especially small delta-wings) can fly at an appreciable speed. These can cause injury to passers-by in an accident. Pilots should consider what might happen if they lose control or have radio failure and fly into a person/dog/car/building; therefore keep at an appropriate distance. The Academy of Model Aeronautics 'recommends' a minimum safe distance of at least 50 feet from any spectators other than the pilot.

This includes chest pain from a heart attack. It is taken by mouth, under the tongue, applied to the skin, or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache and low blood pressure. The low blood pressure can be severe. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. It should not be used together with medications within the sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor) family due to the risk of low blood pressure. Nitroglycerin is in the nitrate family of medications. While it is not entirely clear how it works, it is believed to function by dilating blood vessels. Nitroglycerin was written about as early as 1846 and came into medical use in 1878. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The drug nitroglycerin (GTN) is a dilute form of the same chemical used as the explosive, nitroglycerin. Dilution makes it non- explosive. In 2017, it was the 143rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses Three different forms of nitroglycerin: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch. Nitroglycerin is used for the treatment of angina, acute myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, and acute coronary artery spasms. =Angina= GTN is useful in decreasing angina attacks, perhaps more so than reversing angina once started, by supplementing blood concentrations of NO, also called endothelium-derived relaxing factor, before the structure of NO as the responsible agent was known. This led to the development of transdermal patches of glyceryl trinitrate, providing 24-hour release. However, the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate is limited by development of tolerance/tachyphylaxis within 2–3 weeks of sustained use. Continuous administration and absorption (such as provided by daily pills and especially skin patches) accelerate onset of tolerance and limit the usefulness of the agent. Thus, glyceryl trinitrate works best when used only in short-term, pulse dosing. Glyceryl trinitrate is useful for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and pulmonary edema, again working best if used quickly, within a few minutes of symptom onset, as a pulse dose. It may also be given as a sublingual or buccal dose in the form of a tablet placed under the tongue or a spray into the mouth for the treatment of an angina attack. =Other uses= Tentative evidence indicates efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate in the treatment of various tendinopathies, both in pain management and acceleration of soft tissue repair. GTN is also used in the treatment of anal fissures, though usually at a much lower concentration than that used for angina treatment. GTN has been used to decrease pain associated with dysmenorrhea. =Tolerance= After long-term use for chronic conditions, nitrate tolerance—tolerance to agents such as GTN— may develop in a patient, reducing its effectiveness. Tolerance is defined as the loss of symptomatic and hemodynamic effects of GTN and/or the need for higher doses of the drug to achieve the same effects, and was first described soon after the introduction of GTN in cardiovascular therapy. Studies have shown that nitrate tolerance is associated with vascular abnormalities which have the potential to worsen patients' prognosis.Nakamura et al. These include endothelial and autonomic dysfunction.Gori et al. The mechanisms of nitrate tolerance have been investigated over the last 30 years, and several hypotheses to explain tolerance have been offered, including: # plasma volume expansion # impaired transformation of GTN into NO or related species # counteraction of GTN vasodilation by neurohormonal activationSuch activation is suggested to cause sympathetic activation, and release of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and angiotensin II. # oxidative stressHypothesis of Munzel et al. (1995). Recent evidence suggests that deleterious GTN-induced production of oxygen free radicals might induce a number of abnormalities, include those described above, so that the oxidative stress hypothesis might represent a unifying principle. Adverse events Glyceryl trinitrate can cause severe hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and severe headaches that necessitate analgesic intervention for pain relief, the painful nature of which can have a marked negative effect on patient compliance. GTN also can cause severe hypotension, circulatory collapse, and death if used together with vasodilator drugs that are used for erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. GTN transdermal patches should be removed before defibrillation due to the risk of explosion and/or burns, but investigations have concluded that GTN patch explosions during defibrillation were due to voltage breakdown involving the metal mesh in some patches. Mechanism of action GTN is a prodrug which must be denitrated, with the nitrite anion or a related species further reduced to produce the active metabolite nitric oxide (NO). Organic nitrates that undergo these two steps within the body are called nitrovasodilators, and the denitration and reduction occur via a variety of mechanisms. The mechanism by which such nitrates produce NO is widely disputed. Some believe that organic nitrates produce NO by reacting with sulfhydryl groups, while others believe that enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450 (CYP), and xanthine oxidoreductase are the primary source of GTN bioactivation. In recent years, a great deal of evidence has been produced that supports the conclusion that GTN's clinically relevant denitration and reduction produce 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (GDN) and NO, and that this reaction is catalysed by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2 or mtALDH). The NO produced by this process is a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase (GC) by heme-dependent mechanisms; this activation results in formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Among other roles, cGMP serves as a substrate for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates myosin light chain phosphatase. Thus, production of NO from exogenous sources such as GTN increases the level of cGMP within the cell, and stimulates dephosphorylation of myosin, which initiates relaxation of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. History It was known almost from the time of the first synthesis of GTN by Ascanio Sobrero in 1846 that handling and tasting of nitroglycerin could cause sudden intense headaches, From p. 248: \\"Il faut toutefois être sur ses gardes en faissant cet essai, car il suffit d'en tenir une très-petite quantité (ce qu'on peut en prendre en y mouillant légèrement le bout du petit doigt) sur la langue pour en éprouver une migraine assez forte pendant pleusieurs heures. Cette action sur le corps humain a été constatée par plusieurs personnes dans mon laboratoire, et je l'ai éprouvée plusieurs fois sur moi-même avant que je fusse certain qu'elle a des propriétés toxiques.\\" (It is always necessary to be on one's guard when making this test, for it suffices to take a very small quantity of it (which one can take by lightly wetting, in it, the tip of the little finger) on [one's] tongue in order to feel a quite strong headache for several hours. This action on the human body has been confirmed by several persons in my laboratory, and I tested it several times on myself before I was certain that it has toxic properties.) From p. 198: \\" … basta il tenere una gocciolina di Piroglicerina sulla lingua, senza inghiottirla, perchè si provi tosto un violento dolore di capo, quale è quello di una forte emicrania, accompagnato da pulsazioni interne assai penose: nello stesso tempo provasi debolezza alle estremità inferiori. Questo effetto sentii io più volte, ed il provarono il signor prof. Valerico Cauda prepartore della mia scuola, ed altre persone ehe tentarono l'esperimento.\\" ( … it suffices to hold a droplet of Piroglicerina [i.e., Sabrero's name for nitroglycerin] on [one's] tongue, without swallowing it, because one soon feels a violent pain in the head, which is a strong headache, accompanied by very painful internal throbbings; at the same time one would feel weakness in the lower extremities. This effect I felt many times, and it was felt by Prof. Valerico Cauda, who prepares lecture demonstrations at my school, and [by] other people who tried the experiment.) which suggested a vasodilation effect (as suggested by Sobrero).(Sobrero, 1849), pp. 198–199. On pages 198–199, Sobrero describes the results of administering nitroglycerin to a puppy, a mouse, and a guinea pig. After giving (orally) several centigrams of nitroglycerin to a puppy, the animal vomited, and within 7-8 minutes, it ceased to breath. Sobrero managed to revive it, but it convulsed. \\"L'apertura del suo corpo non diede a scorgere alterazione veruna al ventricolo. I vasi de cervello erano pieni di sangue, come rigonfii di sangue erano l'orocchietta destra de cuore e specialmente la vena cava superiore.\\" (The opening of its body did not reveal any deterioration of the ventricle. The vessels of the brain were full of blood; similarly swollen with blood were the right auricle of the heart and especially the superior vena cava.) Administering nitroglycerin to a mouse and a guinea pig produced similar results. Constantine Hering developed a form of nitroglycerin in 1847 and advocated for its dosing as a treatment of a number of diseases; however, its use as a specific treatment for blood pressure and chest pain was not among these. This is primarily due to his deep rooted focus in homeopathy. Note: Hering renamed nitroglycerine \\"glonoine\\". See pp. 22–23. Following Thomas Brunton's discovery that amyl nitrite could be used to treat chest pain, William Murrell experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and reduce blood pressure, and showed that the accompanying headaches occurred as a result of overdose. Murrell began treating patients with small doses of GTN in 1878, and the substance was widely adopted after he published his results in The Lancet in 1879. The medical establishment used the name \\"glyceryl trinitrate\\" or \\"trinitrin\\" to avoid alarming patients, because of a general awareness that nitroglycerin was explosive. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.

''' The Council of the Indies; officially, the Royal and Supreme Council of the Indies (, ), was the most important administrative organ of the Spanish Empire for the Americas and the Philippines. The crown held absolute power over the Indies and the Council of the Indies was the administrative and advisory body for those overseas realms. It was established in 1524 by Charles V to administer \\"the Indies,\\" Spain's name for its territories. Such an administrative entity, on the conciliar model of the Council of Castile, was created following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire in 1521, which demonstrated the importance of the Americas. Originally an itinerary council that followed Charles V, it was subsequently established as an autonomous body with legislative, executive and judicial functions by Philip II of Spain and placed in Madrid in 1561. The Council of the Indies was abolished in 1812 by the Cortes of Cádiz, briefly restored in 1814 by Ferdinand VII of Spain, and definitively abolished in 1834 by the regency, acting on behalf of the four-year-old Isabella II of Spain.Fernando Cervantes, \\"Council of the Indies\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, p. 36163. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.El Consejo Real de Castilla y la Ley History The palace of the Alcázar in Madrid, residence of the kings of Spain, in which the Council of the Indies was installed till 1701. Pedro Moya de Contreras, former archbishop of Mexico, President of the Council of the Indies Luis de Velasco II, Marqués de Salinas, Viceroy of New Spain and of Peru, later President of the Council of the Indies Juan de Solórzano Pereira, member of the Council of the Indies. Queen Isabella had granted extensive authority to Christopher Columbus, but then withdrew that authority, and established direct royal control, putting matters of the Indies in the hands of her chaplain, Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca in 1493. The Catholic Monarchs (Isabella and Ferdinand) designated Rodríguez de Fonseca to study the problems related to the colonization process arising from what was seen as tyrannical behavior of Governor Christopher Columbus and his misgovernment of Natives and Iberian settlers. Rodríguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy. He presided over a committee or council, which contained a number of members of the Council of Castile (Consejo de Castilla), and formed a Junta de Indias of about eight counselors. Emperor Charles V was already using the term \\"Council of the Indies\\" in 1519. The Council of the Indies was formally created on August 1, 1524. The king was informed weekly, and sometimes daily, of decisions reached by the Council, which came to exercise supreme authority over the Indies at the local level and over the Casa de Contratación (\\"House of Trade\\") founded in 1503 at Seville as a customs storehouse for the Indies. Civil suits of sufficient importance could be appealed from an audiencia in the New World to the Council, functioning as a court of last resort.Gibson, 94-95. There were two secretaries of the Council, one in charge of Peru, Chile, Tierrafirme (northern South America), and the Kingdom of New Granada; the other was in charge of New Spain, encompassing Mexico, Guatemala, Nueva Galicia, Hispaniola, and the Philippines. The name of the Council did not change with the addition of the indias orientales of the Philippines and other Pacific territories claimed by Spain to the original indias occidentales.Recopilación de las leyes de Indias, Libro II, Título VI. Internecine fighting and political instability in Peru and the untiring efforts of Bartolomé de las Casas on behalf of the natives' rights resulted in Charles's overhaul of the structure of the Council in 1542 with issuing of the \\"New Laws,\\" which put limits on the rights of Spanish holders of encomiendas, grants of indigenous labor. Under Charles II the Council undertook the project to formally codify the large volume of Council and Crown's decisions and legislation for the Indies in the 1680 publication, the Laws of the Indies (:es:Recopilación de las Leyes de Indias) and re-codified in 1791.Gibson, 109-110, note 24. The Council of the Indies was usually headed by an ecclesiastic, but the councilors were generally non-clerics trained in law. In later years, nobles and royal favorites were in the ranks of councilors, as well as men who had experience in the high courts (Audiencias) of the Indies. A key example of such an experienced councilor was Juan de Solórzano Pereira, author of Política Indiana, who served in Peru prior to being named to the Council of the IndiesCervantes, \\"Council of the Indies\\" p. 361. and led the project on the Laws of the Indies. Other noteworthy Presidents of the Council were :es:Francisco Tello de Sandoval; :es:Juan de Ovando y Godoy; Pedro Moya de Contreras, former archbishop of Mexico; and Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas, former viceroy of both Mexico and Peru. Although initially the Council had responsibility for all aspects of the Indies, under Philip II the financial aspects of the empire were shifted to the Council on Finance in 1556-57, a source of conflict between the two councils, especially since Spanish America came to be the source of the empire's wealth. When the Holy Office of the Inquisition was established as an institution in Mexico and Lima in the 1570s, the Council of the Indies was removed from control. The head of the Supreme Council of the Inquisition, :es:Juan de Ovando y Godoy became president of the Council of the Indies 1571-75. He was appalled by the ignorance of the Indies by those serving on the Council. He sought the creation of a general description of the territories, which was never completed, but the Relaciones geográficas were the result of that project.Cervantes, \\"Council of the Indies\\", p. 362. The height of the Council's power was in the sixteenth century. Its power declined and the quality of the councillors decreased. In the final years of the Habsburg dynasty, some appointments were sold or were accorded to people obviously unqualified, such as a nine-year-old boy, whose father had rendered services to the crown.Burkholder, Mark A. \\"Council of the Indies\\", vol. 2, p. 293. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. With the ascension of the Bourbon dynasty at the start of the eighteenth century, a series of administrative changes, known as the Bourbon reforms, were introduced. In 1714 Philip V created a Secretariat of the Navy and the Indies (Secretaría de Marina e Indias) with a single Minister of the Indies, which superseded the administrative functions of the Council, although the Council continued to function in a secondary role until the nineteenth century. Fifty years later Charles III set up a separate Secretary of State for the Indies (Secretarío del Estado del Despacho Universal de Indias).Gibson, 167-168. In the late eighteenth century, the Council became powerful and prestigious again, with a great number of well qualified councillors with experience in the Indies.Burkholder, \\"Council of the Indies\\" p. 293. In 1808 Napoleon invaded Spain placed his brother, Joseph Napoleon on the throne. The Cortes of Cádiz, the body Spaniards considered the legitimate government in Spain and its overseas territories in the absence of their Bourbon monarch, abolished the Council in 1812. It was restored in 1814 upon Ferdinand VII's restoration, and the autocratic monarch appointed a great number of Councillors with American experience.Burkholder, \\"Council of the Indies\\" p. 293. The Council was finally abolished in 1834, a year after Ferdinand VII's death and after the loss of most of Spain's empire in the Americas. The archives of the Council, the Archivo General de Indias one of the major centers of documentation for Spanish, Spanish American, and European history, are housed in Seville.

Pushbacks are carried out by special, low-profile vehicles called pushback tractors or tugs. Although many aircraft are capable of moving themselves backwards on the ground using reverse thrust (a procedure referred to as a powerback), the resulting jet blast or prop wash might cause damage to the terminal building or equipment. Engines close to the ground may also blow sand and debris forward and then suck them into the engine, causing damage to the engine. A pushback is therefore the preferred method to move the aircraft away from the gate. Procedure Airbus A380 pushback Pushbacks at busy aerodromes are usually subject to ground control clearance to facilitate ground movement on taxiways. Once clearance is obtained, the pilot will communicate with the tractor driver (or a ground handler walking alongside the aircraft in some cases) to start the pushback. To communicate, a headset may be connected near the nose gear. Since the pilots cannot see what is behind the aircraft, steering is done by the pushback tractor driver and not by the pilots. Depending on the aircraft type and airline procedure, a bypass pin may be temporarily installed into the nose gear to disconnect it from the aircraft's normal steering mechanism. Once the pushback is completed, the towbar is disconnected, and any bypass pin removed. The ground handler will show the bypass pin to the pilots to make it clear that it has been removed. The pushback is then complete, and the aircraft can taxi forward under its own power. Equipment = Moving light aircraft = Light aircraft can usually be moved by human power alone. Here, this Aerotechnik EV-97A Eurostar is being pulled into position for refueling Very small airplanes may be moved by human power alone. The airplane may be pushed or pulled by landing gear or wing struts since they're known to be strong enough to drag the airplane through the air. To allow for turns, a person may either pick up or push down on the tail to raise either the nose wheel or tail wheel off the ground, then rotate the airplane by hand. A less cumbersome method involves attaching a short tow bar to either the nose wheel or tail wheel, which provides a solid handhold and leverage to steer with, as well as eliminates the danger of handling the propeller. These tow bars are usually a lightweight aluminum alloy construction which allows them to be carried on board the airplane. Other small tow bars have a powered wheel to help move the airplane, with power sources as diverse as lawnmower engines or battery-operated electric drills. However, powered tow bars are usually too large and heavy to be practically carried on small airplanes. =Tractors and towbars= Photo shows a pushback tug carrying a towbar on apron. A conventional tractor hooked up to a United Airlines Boeing 777-200ER at Denver International Airport Large aircraft cannot be moved by hand and must have a tractor or tug. Pushback tractors use a low profile design to fit under the aircraft nose. For sufficient traction the tractor must be heavy, and most models can have extra ballast added. A typical tractor for large aircraft weighs up to and has a drawbar pull of . Often the driver's cabin can be raised for increased visibility when reversing and lowered to fit under aircraft. There are two types of pushback tractors: conventional and towbarless (TBL). Conventional tugs use a tow bar to connect the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The tow bar is fixed laterally at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the tow bar may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the tow bar acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The tow bar must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the tow bar wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The tow bar can be connected at the front or the rear of the tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug. A towbarless tug at Frankfurt Airport transporting a Lufthansa Airbus A340-300 Towbars are used to connect the tractor to the aircraft. Towbarless (TBL) tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground. This avoids the time penalty of connecting/disconnecting a towbar, and entirely removes the cost/complexity of maintaining towbars on the ramp. The tug itself does not need to be particularly massive - the aircraft's nosewheel weight provides the necessary downward force. Lastly, a TBL tug is much shorter (compared to a tug+towbar system) and has one only a single pivot point instead of one at either end of the towbar, so it has much simpler and precise control of the aircraft. This is very useful in general aviation settings with a wider variety of aircraft in more confined spaces than their airline counterparts. Manufacturers of electric TBL tugs offer models capable of moving any aircraft from the smallest single-engine type to narrow-body airliners, military cargo and airline-sized business jets. Just as specialized towbars are required for a wide range of aircraft, many TBL tugs use adapters which enable the movement of many unique aircraft. The majority of aircraft do not require adapters and can be moved without any special adjustments to the tug. This is in contrast to conventional tugs which often use so-called \\"universal\\" towbars which must be adjustable to suit many aircraft types. Electric TBL tugs are gaining popularity among general aviation operators and FBOs as an alternative to gas or diesel-powered conventional tugs. Being electric rather than internal combustion-powered, electric tugs are low-emission which is a major advantage for environmentally-conscious operators; this also enables the tug to be safely operated inside a closed hangar. =Robotic tractor= The Lahav Division of Israel Aerospace Industries has developed a semi-robotic towbarless tractor it calls Taxibot that can tow an aircraft from the terminal gate to the take-off point (taxi-out phase) and return it to the gate after landing (taxi-in phase). The Taxibot eliminates the use of airplane engines during taxi-in and until immediately prior to take-off during taxi-out potentially saving airlines billions of dollars in fuel that is used. The Taxibot is controlled by the pilot from the cockpit using the regular pilot controls. Other equipment applications While the vehicle is referred to as a pushback tug, it is also used to tow aircraft in areas where taxiing the aircraft is not practical or is unsafe, such as moving aircraft in and out of maintenance hangars, or moving aircraft that are not under their own power. Some airlines, notably Virgin Atlantic, advocated towing aircraft to the holding point of the runway to save fuel and reduce environmental impact, however, the practice was discontinued after landing gear maintenance costs increased due to the stresses originating during the towing process.Ellie Zolfagharifard, \\"Reducing runway emissions\\", The Engineer, December 7, 2009. Some fuel must still be burned to operate the auxiliary power unit to provide electrical and pneumatic power to run lighting, environmental and communications systems, unless the tug itself provides these sources of power, which some do. This method also places a larger workload on ground crews and equipment, especially if the aircraft and tow tractor ends up having to wait in a long line of aircraft. In media In an advertising campaign, also documented on the television show Fifth Gear, a Volkswagen Touareg was used to pull a Boeing 747. As cited before, the \\"tractor\\" needs to be heavy to aid traction. The Touareg carried 4.3 tons worth of cement bags, and the tires were inflated to twice the normal pressure to handle the extra weight. Tractor tires have high sidewall ratios for that reason. This is the world record for the heaviest load towed by a production car.

Enhancement marshes purify the wastewater and provide wetland habitat. Enhancement marsh effluent is disinfected to improve coliform index changes from birds using tertiary treatment enhancement marsh habitat. After leaving the treatment wetlands the effluent is mixed with water returning from the enhancement marshes. Wild bird feces contain coliform bacteria similar to those found in human sewage. Recreational access is limited to areas where effluent has received secondary treatment and disinfection. Conventional pollutants or wetland detritus Wetland plants use the energy of sunlight to produce five to ten times as much carbohydrate biomass per acre as a wheat field. Detritus from decomposing wetlands vegetation forms the base of a food chain for aquatic organisms, birds and mammals. Individuals who value wetland environments may not realize the effluent characteristics necessary for release of treated wastewater to Humboldt Bay. Although there is no evidence of harm to wildlife, some regulators suggest potential risk to wildlife using treatment wetlands because of an absence of significant research on wildlife exposure to partially treated effluent and to potential accumulation of chemicals being removed from effluent in wetland treatment processes. Ongoing research at Humboldt State University minimizes potential risk to Humboldt Bay wetlands and wildlife. The City of Arcata generates an average volume of of sewage per day. Winter rainfall onto the large surface area of treatment ponds and marshes increases the volume of effluent discharged from the wetland treatment system to as much as per day.United States Environmental Protection Agency Arcata, California -- A Natural System for Wastewater Reclamation and Resource Enhancement (1993) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulationsU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. \\"Secondary Treatment Regulation.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR Part 133. require monthly average effluent concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand and of total suspended solids to be no greater than 30 mg/L, with an additional requirement for removal of 85 percent of the quantities measured in untreated sewage from the City of Arcata. Unfortunately, when measuring concentrations leaving treatment wetlands, neither of these analytical methods can distinguish between unremoved conventional pollutants originally arriving in sewage, or detritus of decomposing wetland vegetation; so the limitations may apply to the sum of both.Franson, Mary Ann Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 14th Edition (1976) American Public Health Association pp.89-95&543-544 Wildlife The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary encompasses 307 acres of land situated along the Pacific Flyway. Over 327 species of birds have been recorded at the sanctuary. Numerous plant, mammal, fish, insect, reptile and amphibian species inhabit the marsh. These include river otters, gray foxes, red-legged frog, tidewater goby, bobcat, striped skunk, praying mantis and red-sided garter snake. Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center The Friends of the Arcata Marsh (FOAM) operate the Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center that contains exhibits about the operations of the treatment plant, the importance of the marsh, and about the plants and animals that live there. Volunteer docents give tours of the marsh. Education programs are offered for school, scout and other groups, as well as summer camp programs.

Technically a rebuild, the Beep (a portmanteau of \\"Baldwin Geep\\", whose official designation was derived from \\"SWitcher, Baldwin Locomotive Works\\") originally entered service on the Santa Fe as a Baldwin Model VO-1000. Following its successful CF7 capital rebuilding program, the company hoped to determine if remanufacturing its aging, non-EMD end cab switchers by fitting them with new EMD prime movers was an economically viable proposition. The conversion procedure proved too costly and only the one unit was modified. In 2008-2009, this locomotive was retired and stored operational at Topeka, Kansas. In May 2009 the unit was donated to the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow, California. History In the early 1960s the Reading Company sent 14 of their VO-1000s to General Motors Electro-Motive Division to have them rebuilt to SW900 specifications. Unlike the \\"Beep\\", these locomotives retained most of their original carbodies. The units were subsequently given the designation VO-1000m. =Development= VO-1000 No. 67729 emerged from the Baldwin Locomotive Works Eddystone, Pennsylvania, facility in July 1943 dressed in the Santa Fe Zebra Stripe livery and bearing #2220. In the early 1960s the unit would take on the blue and yellow Billboard paint scheme with \\"SANTA FE\\" displayed in small yellow letters above the accent stripe, as was the standard for all yard switchers. It is these colors that #2220 displayed when it was selected as a test subject. Much as with the CF7 conversions, the unit was stripped down to its bare frame, and the long hood, power plant, trucks, control gear, and electrical system scrapped; only the Baldwin cab remained. In a manner similar to the first CF7 modification, a sixteen-cylinder EMD 567 series diesel engine was fitted to the Baldwin's cast steel frame, which required a considerable amount of modification. A new long hood was fabricated by the shops to a GP7 pattern. The locomotive was configured in a B-B wheel arrangement and mounted atop two Blomberg B two-axle trucks, with all axles powered. The unit received an advanced electrical system. The completed Beep rolled out of the Cleburne shops in December 1970 (with one of its original Baldwin builder's plates still affixed) sporting fresh blue and yellow paint, though now the words \\"Santa Fe\\" were applied in yellow in Cooper Black font (logotype) along the sides below the accent stripe in the style otherwise reserved for road switchers and other main line locomotives. It was also assigned #2450 (the first CF7 was given #2649, with successive numbers applied in descending order) and placed in service in south Texas. =In service= Train crews favored #2450 due to the superior riding qualities of its Blomberg trucks, which ran more smoothly than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks. Being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher tractive effort, helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 as part of a general locomotive renumbering scheme. It was again renumbered along with the Santa Fe's few remaining EMD switchers and assigned #1460 in January, 1977. The Beep was transferred to Cleburne as the shop switcher in the mid-1980s, where in 1985 it was given a number of external modifications. A cab air conditioning system was added, and the rear cab windows were modified from their original Baldwin pattern to a new three- pane configuration that accommodated the use of standard window glass sizes common to many EMD locomotives. The unit was given fresh paint (the Billboard colors were maintained) and placed back in service. SW900 #1453, Santa Fe's last \\"standard\\" EMD switcher, was retired in 1987, thus making #1460 the only end cab switcher on the roster. The Beep continued working at Cleburne until the shops were closed later that year. Since then, the unit has worked as a shop switcher at both the Argentine shops in Kansas City and in Topeka, Kansas. The locomotive was equipped with remote control equipment (RCE) in the early 1990s so that it could be operated from a distance. After Santa Fe merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1995-1996 to form BNSF Railway, the Beep was one of only three blue and yellow units not affected by the new company's renumbering program. #1460's cab sides were affixed with a BNSF sublettering \\"patch\\" and retrofitted with a four-stack exhaust manifold.http://atsf.railfan.net/beep/sf1460ekimmel.jpg It was retired in 2008-2009, and later stored in Topeka, Kansas. In May 2009, the unit was donated to the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow, California, where it remains on static display. =Footnote= Santa Fe had designated a handful of other non-EMD switcher locomotives for rebuilding around 1970 (including two Fairbanks-Morse H-10-44s), but all of these units were subsequently scrapped when it was determined that the required modifications were not cost effective.

The title refers to the 1908 song \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", the official anthem of baseball. The episode aired during the 1998 World Series. Sisko and station staff play a baseball game in Quark's holosuites with the crew of a visiting Federation space vessel. This episode was first broadcast on October 21, 1998. Summary The episode develops the recurring motif of Captain Benjamin Sisko's love of baseball, which was established in the pilot episode \\"Emissary\\". Sisko accepts a challenge from a Vulcan crew to a game, and forms a team from his regular staff members in short order. The Vulcan crew's starship, the T’Kumbra is in for repairs after a tour of duty in the Dominion War. The DS9 team is called the \\"Niners\\",Larry Granillo, Take Me Out to the Holosuite: A Star Trek DS9 Breakdown, Baseball Prospectus, November 3, 2011 which in turn became a term for fans of the series.

By Frank Garcia, Mark Phillips This episode was written by Ronald D. Moore and directed by Chip Chalmers. Guest stars include Greg Wagrasky as Solok, Chase Masterson as Leeta, and Penny Johnson as Kasidy Yates.The Star Trek Encyclopedia By Michael Okuda, Denise Okuda, Debbie Mirek Plot A Starfleet starship docks at Deep Space Nine. Sisko recognises its captain, Solok, as a former classmate and longtime rival. Solok believes that his all-Vulcan crew are superior in every respect, and challenges Sisko to a baseball game in the holosuite. Sisko accepts, even though this gives him only two weeks to form a team into shape, and his son Jake is the only other potential member who has played the game before. Sisko's team trains hard and suffers injuries. Impatiently, he dismisses Rom from the team, and the squad nearly quits in protest. Sisko admits to Kasidy Yates that he is taking Solok's challenge so seriously, but it is not because of baseball, it is because of Solok: At Starfleet Academy, Sisko challenged Solok to a wrestling match after Solok provoked a drunken Sisko by announcing that he was studying \\"illogical human bonding rituals\\", but Solok won causing Sisko several injuries. Kasidy was amused that Ben would have even challenged Solok, because Vulcans are three times stronger than humans. Afterwards, Solok used the incident as evidence of his viewpoint that Vulcans are superior to humans. Solok published 5 papers on the wrestling match during their time at academy, and after they graduated Solok published over a dozen papers comparing Vulcans and humans, each beginning with an analysis of the wrestling match, and Sisko refused to lose at his favorite sport to Solok. Sisko makes Kasidy promise to keep this between them, but she immediately tells the truth to the whole team, making them understand just how much this means to Sisko. When the game is played, the Logicians (Solok's team) immediately build up a good score. Sisko gets into an argument with the umpire, security chief Odo, and is thrown out of the game for laying a finger on him. Near the end and 10-0 down, the Niners (Sisko's team) are desperate to score a run. Rom's son Nog makes it to third base. In consideration for Rom's feelings, Sisko sends him into the game. Rom accidentally hits a perfect bunt, which brings Nog home, giving the Niners their only run in a 10-1 loss. The team's celebration confuses Solok, who protests to Odo, but also touches him so Odo ejects him too. After the game, the DS9 crew relax at Quark's bar, toasting the triumph of team spirit over Vulcan superiority. Solok protests their celebration, only to be taunted. After continued disparaging attacks by Solok that are met with more mockery, Kira throws Sisko a baseball that his whole team has signed. When Sisko asks Solok if he wants to sign the ball, Solok leaves. Production Max Grodénchik, who plays Rom, is actually a baseball player in real life and considered going pro before deciding to become an actor. Because Grodénchik was so good at playing right-handed, he was forced to switch to playing exclusively left-handed on camera in order to give a convincingly \\"bad\\" performance. Cinefantastique (Volume 38) noted that Michael Piller was fond of baseball and this influenced some of his productions.

The episode premiered to Nielsen ratings of 4.6.http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings7.html Plot The mirror-universe Ezri shows up demanding that Quark bring a cloaking device to the Regent Worf in exchange for Grand Nagus Zek, who went to the other side in search of business opportunities. Quark enlists Rom's help in stealing one of those devices from a docked Klingon Bird-of-Prey (specifically, General Martok's Bird of Prey the Rotarran), which they hide by cloaking the cloaking device. When they reach the habitat ring, they avoid questions from a confused Benjamin Sisko and an impatient General Martok when they are noticed idly staring at a bulkhead. They manage to get the device to mirror Ezri, and are forced to transport to the mirror universe when Martok discovers the theft. Upon arrival at the alternate Deep Space 9 (now called Terok Nor), they meet Vic Fontaine, who is not a hologram in the mirror universe. The three are held captive, as the Rebellion cannot allow the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance to gain such cloaking technology. They are rescued by an alternate version of Brunt, who brings them to the Regent, where it is revealed that the alternate Kira Nerys had planned this all along. Quark and Rom discover that Kira and Ezri are lovers and are then imprisoned. Zek tells the other two Ferengi that he stole the plans to the multidimensional transporter so he could arrange business agreements with this universe, but the plan backfired when he was caught. Rom is forced to install the cloaking device on the Regent's ship, but despite his cooperation, he and Quark are still sentenced to die at the hands of mirror Elim Garak. Ezri, however, injects Garak with the poison meant for Quark and Rom; she reveals her motivations to be both a grudge against Garak and regret over the death of Brunt. The empire attempts to use the cloaking device on the Regent's ship, but it turns out that Rom had sabotaged the device to drain the power grid, and the ship is easily overtaken by the Defiant, forcing Worf to surrender to the Rebels. The Rebels bring the three Ferengi (and Zek's servant, Maihar'du) back to Terok Nor, where a Leeta who never married Rom comes to \\"debrief\\" Ezri.

Mubarak ascended the throne upon killing his half-brother, Muhammad Al- Sabah. Mubarak was the seventh ruler of the Al-Sabah dynasty. Mubarak was also the father of two rulers of Kuwait that succeeded him, Jaber and Salim, from which the Al-Jaber and Al-Salim in the Al-Sabah family branches originated respectively, and is the paternal ancestor of all successive rulers and prime ministers of Kuwait. Sheikh Mubarak signed the Anglo-Kuwaiti Treaty with Great Britain on November 23, 1899, pledging himself and his successors not to receive foreign agents or representatives or to cede or sell territory without the approval of the British government, with this agreement, and the guarantee it represented in Kuwait and the Al-Sabah family, he is regarded as the founder of modern-day Kuwait. German explorer Hermann Burchardt photographed Sheikh Mubarak in 1903, in what is now an iconic photograph.See Sheikh Mubarak, 1903 (Click on photo to enlarge). Early life Mubarak was born into Kuwaiti's powerful al-Sabah family in 1837 son of Sheikh Sabah II Al- Sabah (r. 1859-1866). Once he was older Mubarak served primarily as the cavalry commander of the Military of Kuwait in many operations, including several Ottoman campaigns; most notably: 1871, 1892, and 1894 campaigns into Hasa, Qatar, and southern Iraq. For his long service Mubarak received the title istabl-i amire payesi, “(Rank of) The Grand Equerry of his Imperial Majesty” in August 1879 for a campaign into Qatif and southern Iraq. He was given four more Ottoman honors as reward for his services in the Qatar campaign, though the value of his contributions are disputed. Although Mubarak was widely known for his ties with the British after his ascension to sheikhdom in 1896, he did have interactions with the British as early as 1863 when he met Sir Lewis Pelly, British political resident of Persia who went on many diplomatic missions around the region, and in 1883 when he was sent on an Ottoman diplomatic mission to Bahrain. Death of Muhammad and Jarrah Al- Sabah On May 8, 1896 Mubarak's half-brothers, Muhammad and Jarrah, were killed by him, enabling Mubarak's assumption of the Kuwaiti throne. Most scholars believe that Mubarak assassinated his half-brothers, but the details of the assassination vary widely. Jill Crystal posits that Mubarak, with his sons Jabir and Salim and loyal supporters assassinated his half-brothers in secret during the night. Frederick Anscombe also states that Mubarak “and his men” (not specified whether his sons were in on the plot) killed his half- brothers in the early hours of the day. There are several possible theories as to why Mubarak may have assassinated his half-brothers. One theory is that Mubarak resented being constantly sent away on tribal expeditions out into the desert. A second related theory is that Muhammad did not adequately fund Mubarak's expeditions. The third theory is that Muhammad was a weak and “indolent” leader whose unpopularity in Kuwait necessitated his removal. The most plausible theory is that Mubarak felt he did not receive his rightful share of the family wealth and property, causing contention and a strong desire to seize it. However, B.J. Slot, who is not even convinced that Mubarak was the assassin, asserts that “the widely divergent stories and interpretations… make it impossible to reach a firm conclusion about what happened in Kuwait in 1896.” Slot notes that on a local level there was a lack of support for people who claimed that Mubarak assassinated his half-brothers and that if he had indeed done it revenge would have been taken on him. Yet news of Mubarak's supposed assassination plot spread throughout the Ottoman Empire and abroad, which proved a serious obstacle in establishing his legitimacy as a ruler. Struggle for legitimacy Mubarak acted quickly to bribe the Ottoman bureaucracy through lavish gift giving in order to gain support for his appointment as kaymakam [sub governor] of Kuwait like his previous brothers. This is further illustrated through a memorandum by Captain J.F. Whyte, a British agent stationed in Basra: “Sheikh Mubarak has, since his usurpation, been employing his late brother’s wealth to secure his recognition as Sheikh and his appointment as Kaimakam of Koweit by the Sublime Porte.” Mubarak constantly avowed his loyalty to Istanbul, but a bitter debate raged among the ruling Ottoman Council on what course of action to take with Mubarak and his apparent fratricide. The debates were fueled by a lack of information and confusing accounts surrounding Mubarak, partly because of Mubarak's own manipulation and spread of disinformation. Some Ottoman officers considered military action in Kuwait as a solution to the problem, especially Hamdi Pasha the Wali of Basra, who proposed an intervention from Basra into Kuwait. The Ottomans were very hesitant to name Mubarak as kaymakam, but he was given the title on December 1897 in large part due to a controversy that exploded. The resolution passed due to a controversy and conspiracy that involved Mubarak and Basra's government regarding Mubarak's rival, Yusuf al-Ibrahim, . The controversy further destabilized relations in the region to dangerous levels. Because of the tension and instability of the situation the Ottoman Council decided that naming Mubarak kaymakam would be a better alternative to potentially bloody military action. Another reason was that military intervention may have further destabilized the region and destroyed any support that the Ottomans had with the Kuwaiti people. Finally, the Ottomans also had growing anxiety over possible encroachment by the Great Powers, most notably Britain and Russia into the region due to the construction of the Baghdad Railway. They thought that bestowing the title could dissuade any foreign powers from interfering with Kuwait. Relations with the British Empire See Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899 The long Ottoman indecisiveness in naming Mubarak kaymakam, as well as feelings of vulnerability helped pave the way for Mubarak to pursue British ties. On January 18, 1899 Mubarak signed a secret agreement with Major M.J. Meade, British political resident in Bushire, that guarded Kuwait against any outside foreign aggression. It also required Mubarak and his successors not to receive foreign agents or representatives or to cede or sell territory without the approval of the British government. Meade was eager to establish Kuwait as an official British protectorate with the intention of extending British influence further into the Persian Gulf and protecting its own trade as well as controlling the potential terminus for a purposed railway from Port Said and the prevention of a possible Ottoman or Russian takeover of Kuwait. However, neither Mubarak nor other British officials wanted to make Kuwait a protectorate. As a private letter from Sir Arthur Godley, Permanent Under-Secretary of India, wrote to Lord Curzon “…we don’t want Koweit, but we don’t want anyone else to have it.” Mubarak's British protection made him free to secure and strengthen his own power without fear of any outside interference from the Ottomans, surrounding tribes, or the Russians. 1901 campaign Mubarak, comforted by British protection felt free to pursue his own policies and mounted an invasion into Najd (Central Arabia) with an army of Kuwaiti townspeople. The objective was to claim the southern portion of the Rashidi dominions in hopes that Mubarak's dream of becoming the new, undisputed Arabian leader would be realized. The campaign was moderately successful until the Battle of Sarif on March 17, 1901 where most of Mubarak's force was destroyed, including the deaths of his brother and two nephews. This marked not only the end of Mubarak's dream but also put him on the verge of losing control of Kuwait. However, B.J. Slot challenges Anscombe's claim that Mubarak had a dream of being the Arab leader of the Arabian Peninsula; rather, Slot contends, it was a maneuver to contain and balance the power in the region that resulted from an alliance between the Rashidi Amir in al-awadhi, Mubarak's enemy Yusuf Al-Ibrahim, and the Baghdad Military Command. Mubarak's major defeat at Sarif severely threatened his rule. He requested on May 28, 1901 for British protectorate status (the British were still debating the meaning of the 1899 Agreement, and it was a secret anyway), but it was denied due to the international tensions surrounding Kuwait. The Ottomans tried to capitalize on Mubarak's major defeat by deliberating a military solution to gain direct control of Kuwait. The Ottomans slowly realized that the growing British presence around Kuwait was a sign of Mubarak's secret dealing with the British. The Ottomans attempted to firmly reestablish their control and influence by opening up customs and harbormaster posts. Through these posts the Ottomans tried to forcefully compel Mubarak to accept the new Ottoman presence, therefore showing real loyalty to the Ottomans. However, the British publicly reinforced Kuwait as they began solidifying the meaning of the 1899 Agreement. This showdown caused a crisis between the Ottomans and the British over Kuwait's status as a state. Status Quo Agreement After the Perseus Zuhaf encounter, where an Ottoman and British warship had a stand-off with each other, Mubarak, the British, and the Ottomans agreed to sign the Status Quo Agreement in September 1901. This agreement maintained that neither the Ottomans nor the British could place troops within Kuwait and that the Ottomans still had jurisdiction over Kuwait. The agreement averted the crisis, but Ottoman control was only nominal with Mubarak to freely pursue his own agendas in the years after. Mubarak after 1902 and increasing sovereignty Mubarak Al Sabah on horseback alongside an accomplice in 1903. Mubarak carried on different activities that helped Kuwait gain more power and sovereignty apart from the Ottomans. Mubarak allowed exclusive rights for Britain to set up a post office in Kuwait in 1904 and in 1905-06 it was being considered that Kuwait should fly its own flag instead of the Ottoman standard. However, neither the post office nor the flag would happen until World War I. Mubarak as well, in October 1907 sold the rights for any terminus railroad sites to the British, compromising the German-Ottoman plan to extend the Berlin-Baghdad Railway to the port, which would have given them access to trade on the Indian subcontinent. In exchange Mubarak received £4000 per year and a promise that Britain would recognize Kuwait's autonomy and the Sheikh's power over it. Mubarak also engaged in affairs concerning the neighboring areas around him, which caused consternation on both the Ottoman and the British sides. Mubarak supported and smuggled British guns to local Arabian leaders. In 1904-1906, while the Ottoman military occupied the important sub-region of al-Qasim in central Najd, Mubarak supported the Ottoman's opponent Ibn Sa’ud giving him “strong moral and material” support. In 1905 Mubarak also served as a mediator between the Saudis and the Ottomans, while simultaneously shaping Saudi strategy during the negotiations. A sign that the Ottoman attitude toward Mubarak was changing occurred in 1911 when in a draft message to Mubarak he was addressed not as “Kaymakam of Kuwait” but rather “Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its Tribes.” This change in attitude, which included other pressures and troubles for the Ottoman Empire including the British lobbying on Kuwait's behalf, led to the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which recognized Kuwait as an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire within the Green zone outlined in the map as well as an independent entity within the red zone outlined in the map. By the time World War I began Mubarak closely sided with the British against the Ottomans, and the 1913 Convention was rendered null. In support of the war effort Mubarak sent a force to Umm Qasr, Safwan, Bubiyan, and Basra to expel the Ottomans in November 1914. In exchange the British government recognized Kuwait as an “independent government under British protection.” There is no report on the exact size and nature of Mubarak's attack, though Ottoman forces did retreat from those positions weeks later. Mubarak soon removed the Ottoman symbol that was on the Kuwaiti flag and replaced it with “Kuwait” written in Arabic script. Mubarak's participation and previous exploits in obstructing the completion of the Baghdad railway helped the British safeguard the Persian Gulf from providing Ottoman and German reinforcements. Death During the later years of Mubarak's life he wrestled with bouts of illness. Mubarak died on November 28, 1915 due to an attack of malaria aggravated by his bad heart. Legacy After Mubarak's death his son Jaber II Al-Sabah ascended to the throne without any problems and when Jaber died his brother Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah took over. Since then to the present day all of Kuwait's rulers have been direct descendants of Mubarak through his two sons. Mubarak's skillful diplomacy and manipulation of the Ottomans and British strengthened his powerbase ensuring Kuwait's eventual independence. Mubarak's interference in tribal affairs and the example he made of himself destabilized the region in that it eventually broke the Ottoman hold over the Persian Gulf. Other rulers in the Gulf were inspired or influenced by Mubarak to take similar actions, many allying strongly with the British. Mubarak established not only the foundations of modern Kuwait but was a key person in the establishment of the modern Persian Gulf.

As a part of a major redistribution before the 1950 election, his seat, North-East Fremantle, was abolished. Tonkin ran for the newly formed seat of Melville, which he won. Tonkin was made Deputy Premier on 23 February 1953 as part of the Cabinet of Albert Hawke. He regained his role as Minister for Education, and was also appointed Minister for Works and Minister for Water Supplies. In April 1956, he was stripped of his education portfolio in favour of Bill Hegney, as part of a cabinet reshuffle. The Labor Party lost government at the 1959 state election. After Labor, again under Hawke, lost both the 1962 and 1965 elections, Tonkin was elected Leader of the Opposition in January 1967. His party lost the 1968 election, but gained two seats. His wife, Rosalie, died in 1969 of cancer. He married his second wife, Joan West, in Wesley Church, Perth, on 13 June 1971, with a reception being held at Perth Airport.\\"She kept him waiting\\" – The Age. Published 14 June 1971. Retrieved from Google News, 7 December 2011. Tonkin gained power at the 1971 state election, narrowly defeating the coalition led by Sir David Brand. Tonkin was in a rather shaky position. Labor had only won government by one seat in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Owing to a severe malapportionment that over-represented rural areas, Tonkin had to contend with a legislative council in which Labor was outnumbered by almost 2-to-1. He was also not helped by the unpopularity of the Whitlam federal Labor government. As a result, despite gaining a modest swing in the Perth area, Labor lost its majority in the 1974 state election Although the Liberals came up two seats short of a majority in that election, the balance of power was held by the National Alliance, a merger between the WA branches of the Country and Democratic Labor parties. Liberal leader Charles Court quickly formed a coalition with the National Alliance, forcing Tonkin to resign. He was thus one of the few state premiers to have been turned out of office after only one term. He stayed on after the election as State parliamentary leader of the ALP, forming a shadow ministry, until his retirement in 1976, when Colin Jamieson succeeded him as Labor leader. After his first wife and daughter died of cancer, Tonkin campaigned for many years for radio-wave therapy treatments for cancer sufferers; and he set up a treatment clinic run by cancer surgeon John Holt in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. At the time he became Premier and married his second wife in the early 1970s, he was already renowned for his tireless support of the Tronado anti-cancer machine. In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1977, John Tonkin was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia.It's an Honour He died in Perth in 1995, at the age of 93.

He spent much of his rule dealing with natural disasters, maintaining stability as well as building stronger ties with the Ottoman Empire which supplied the most vital resource in Kuwait, drinking water. Furthermore, the first coins minted by Kuwait began during his reign  Physical description  Sheik Abdullah II, in his later years, was described as tall with a heavy athletic body and a long white beard. He wore a purple bisht made of silk and copiously adorned with gold embroidery over a thawb, with a white silk scarf used as a belt. On both hands rested many diamond rings. At his waist was an ornate janbiya with a hilt made of solid gold, encrusted with pearls and gemstones.  Early life  Under the orders of his father, on April 24, 1841 Abdullah II signed a one-year naval truce with Samuel Hennell who spoke on behalf of the British which expired and was never renewed. The truce prohibited Kuwait from undertaking any form of maritime offense as well as giving all mediation efforts in maritime disputes over to the British Empire. Reign Sheikh Abdullah II excelled in the art of diplomacy and negotiated with both the Al-Saud family as well as the Ottomans to maintain power. Throughout his reign he constantly rebuffed requests from British Commissioner Sir Bealy, speaking on behalf of the British Empire, to rise up against the Ottomans. He ruled from November 1866 to 1892, inheriting a state that had undergone a century long increase in merchant marine and navy traffic with stable governance partly due to British support. Upon becoming ruler, he quickly pivoted towards the Ottoman Empire and away from the British. He was considered a modest man with simple tastes and had a high degree of public approval. A great deal of this approval hinged on his relief work during natural disasters. In 1868 a great famine struck and he worked tirelessly to bring an end to the rampant starvation. In September 1871 disaster struck again, this time in the maritime industry of Kuwait. Hundreds of Kuwaiti pearling vessels were sunk along with their crews due to extremely high waves. Historians are split on whether this was due to great storms in the Indian Ocean or caused by the eruption of Bushehr. In 1886–87, under Sheikh Abdullah II, Kuwait began minting coins in copper due to the lack of Indian rupees circulating in the local economy. Sheikh Abdullah sided with the Jabir bin Mardaw, Emir of Khorramshar during the Basra and Muhamarrah conflict with the Al-Nasser tribe under his reign, and helped him consolidate power in the region. Due to his allegiance to the Ottoman Empire, in 1871, he was given the title Kaymakam which means provincial sub-governor. He also held the title of Pasha.

In 2006 the course was changed to make the course more of a cross country course and less of a road course. The 5k (3.1 mi.) course at Wickham Park is famous for \\"The Green Monster\\" which is the course's most difficult hill located about 1.5-1.75 miles into the race. The finish of the course is slightly uphill. With the 2006 changes, the best high school runners in Connecticut completed the course in just under 16 minutes. In previous years the winning times were usually 15:25 or less. This increase of about 30–40 seconds is mostly due to a large change in the course after the one-mile (1.6 km) mark, when the course turns onto a wood-chip trail that leads runners downhill around the finish line of the course instead of taking a road down past (in front of) the finish.

It was first published in 1997 by University of Queensland Press, and a new edition with updated information was issued by the same publisher in 2003. The book won the Brisbane City Council's One Book One Brisbane competition in 2003. Plot and themes The Mayne Inheritance tells the story of Patrick Mayne, a young man who migrated to Australia from his impoverished background in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1841. He soon moved to the infant town of Brisbane where he found work as a slaughterman in an abattoir. In 1848 a sawyer, Robert Cox, was savagely murdered at Kangaroo Point and a considerable amount of money was presumed to have been stolen. The next year, Patrick Mayne married and, despite being a poorly paid labourer, bought his own butcher's shop in what is now Brisbane's central business district. He then expanded his business empire through investing cleverly and soon became one of Brisbane's richest men. Patrick became one of the aldermen on the first Brisbane Municipal Council in 1859. He died in 1865 from an unspecified illness, and according to the book during his dying days confessed to the murder of Robert Cox. He left behind a widow and five children who had to survive in a hostile colonial environment which ostracised them for being the children of a confessed murderer. The second half of the book deals mainly with the lives of these children, none of whom married, and in particular James O'Neil Mayne who used the wealth inherited from his father to become a philanthropist. His most notable deed was funding the purchase of of land at St Lucia for the University of Queensland. This spacious riverside site is still the main campus of the University. The story of The Mayne Inheritance spans nearly a century, from Patrick's arrival in Australia in the 1840s to the death of his last surviving child, Mary Emelia Mayne, in 1940, at the age of 81. The narrative takes place within the context of Brisbane's history, and the reader is also taken on the journey of Brisbane's transformation from an isolated colonial hamlet to a major Australian city. Adaptations The book was adapted for the stage by Errol O'Neill and premiered at Brisbane's La Boite Theatre in 2004.

Two nearly identical spacecraft were launched in 2006 into orbits around the Sun that cause them to respectively pull farther ahead of and fall gradually behind the Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections. Contact with STEREO-B was lost in 2014, but STEREO-A is still operational. Mission profile This introductory video demonstrates STEREO's locations and shows a simultaneous image of the entire Sun. The two STEREO spacecraft were launched at 00:52 UTC on October 26, 2006, from Launch Pad 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on a Delta II 7925-10L launcher into highly elliptical geocentric orbits. The apogee reached the Moon's orbit. On December 15, 2006, on the fifth orbit, the pair swung by the Moon for a gravity assist. Because the two spacecraft were in slightly different orbits, the \\"ahead\\" (A) spacecraft was ejected to a heliocentric orbit inside Earth's orbit, while the \\"behind\\" (B) spacecraft remained temporarily in a high Earth orbit. The B spacecraft encountered the Moon again on the same orbital revolution on January 21, 2007, being ejected from Earth orbit in the opposite direction from spacecraft A. Spacecraft B entered a heliocentric orbit outside the Earth's orbit. Spacecraft A will take 347 days to complete one revolution of the Sun and Spacecraft B will take 387 days. The A spacecraft/Sun/Earth angle will increase at 21.650° per year. The B spacecraft/Sun/Earth angle will change −21.999° per year. Given that the length of Earth's orbit is around 940 million kilometres, both craft have an average speed, in a rotating geocentric frame of reference in which the Sun is always in the same direction, of about 1.8 km/s, but the speed varies considerably depending on how close they are to their respective aphelion or perihelion (as well as on the position of Earth). Their current locations are shown here. Over time, the STEREO spacecraft will continue to separate from each other at a combined rate of approximately 44° per year. There are no final positions for the spacecraft. They achieved 90° separation on January 24, 2009, a condition known as quadrature. This is of interest because the mass ejections seen from the side on the limb by one spacecraft can potentially be observed by the in situ particle experiments of the other spacecraft. As they passed through Earth's Lagrangian points and , in late 2009, they searched for Lagrangian (trojan) asteroids. On February 6, 2011, the two spacecraft were exactly 180° apart from each other, allowing the entire Sun to be seen at once for the first time. Even as the angle increases, the addition of an Earth-based view, e.g., from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, will still provide full-Sun observations for several years. In 2015, contact was lost for several months when the STEREO spacecraft passed behind the Sun. They will then start to approach Earth again, with closest approach sometime in 2023. They will not be recaptured into Earth orbit. =Loss of contact with STEREO-B= On October 1, 2014, contact was lost with STEREO-B during a planned reset to test the craft's automation, in anticipation of the aforementioned solar \\"conjunction\\" period. The team originally thought that the spacecraft had begun to spin, decreasing the amount of power that could be generated by the solar panels. Later analysis of the received telemetry concluded that the spacecraft was in an uncontrolled spin of about 3° per second; this was too rapid to be immediately corrected using its reaction wheels, which would become oversaturated. NASA used its Deep Space Network, first weekly and later monthly, to try to re-establish communications. After a silence of 22 months, contact was regained at 22:27 UTC on August 21, 2016, when the Deep Space Network established a lock on STEREO-B for 2.4 hours. Engineers planned to work and develop software to fix the spacecraft, but once its computer was powered up, there would only have been about 2 minutes to upload the fix before STEREO-B entered failure mode again. Further, while the spacecraft was power-positive at the time of contact, its orientation would drift, and power levels fall. Two-way communication was achieved, and commands to begin recovering the spacecraft were sent through the rest of August and September. Six attempts at communication between September 27 and October 9, 2016, failed, and a carrier wave was not detected after September 23. Engineers determined that during an attempt to despin the spacecraft, a frozen thruster fuel valve probably led to the spin increasing rather decreasing. As STEREO-B moved along its orbit, it was hoped that its solar panels may again generate enough power to charge the battery. Four years after the initial loss of contact, NASA terminated periodic recovery operations effective October 17, 2018. Mission benefits The principal benefit of the mission is stereoscopic images of the Sun. In other words, because the satellites are at different points along the Earth's orbit, but distant from the Earth, they can photograph parts of the Sun that are not visible from the Earth. This permits NASA scientists to directly monitor the far side of the Sun, instead of inferring the activity on the far side from data that can be gleaned from Earth's view of the Sun. The STEREO satellites principally monitor the far side for coronal mass ejections — massive bursts of solar wind, solar plasma, and magnetic fields that are sometimes ejected into space. Since the radiation from coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, can disrupt Earth's communications, airlines, power grids, and satellites, more accurate forecasting of CMEs has the potential to provide greater warning to operators of these services. Before STEREO, the detection of the sunspots that are associated with CMEs on the far side of the Sun was only possible using helioseismology, which only provides low-resolution maps of the activity on the far side of the Sun. Since the Sun rotates every 25 days, detail on the far side was invisible to Earth for days at a time before STEREO. The period that the Sun's far side was previously invisible was a principal reason for the STEREO mission. STEREO program scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta expects \\"great advances\\" in theoretical solar physics and space weather forecasting with the advent of constant 360° views of the Sun. STEREO's observations are already being incorporated into forecasts of solar activity for airlines, power companies, satellite operators, and others. STEREO has also been used to discover 122 eclipsing binaries and study hundreds more variable stars. STEREO can look at the same star for up to 20 days. On July 23, 2012, STEREO-A was in the path of the solar storm of 2012, which was similar in strength to the Carrington Event. Its instrumentation was able to collect and relay a significant amount of data about the event. STEREO-A was not harmed by the solar storm. Science instrumentation Instrument locations on STEREO Each of the spacecraft carries cameras, particle experiments and radio detectors in four instrument packages: * Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) has five cameras: an extreme ultraviolet imager (EUVI) and two white-light coronagraphs (COR1 and COR2). These three telescopes are collectively known as the Sun Centered Instrument Package or SCIP. They image the solar disk and the inner and outer corona. Two additional telescopes, heliospheric imagers (called the HI1 and HI2), image the space between Sun and Earth. The purpose of SECCHI is to study the 3-D evolution of coronal mass ejections through their full journey from the Sun's surface through the corona and interplanetary medium to their impact at Earth. * In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT), to study energetic particles, the three-dimensional distribution of solar-wind electrons and interplanetary magnetic field. * PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC), to study the plasma characteristics of protons, alpha particles and heavy ions. * STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) is a radio- burst tracker to study radio disturbances traveling from the Sun to the orbit of Earth. Spacecraft subsystems Each STEREO spacecraft had a dry mass of and a launch mass of . In their stowed configuration, each had a length, width and height of . Upon solar-array deployment, its width increased to . With all of its instrument booms and antennae deployed, its dimensions are . The solar panels can produce an average of 596 watts of power, and the spacecraft consumes an average of 475 watts. The STEREO spacecraft are 3-axis-stabilized, and each has a primary and backup miniature inertial measurement unit (MIMU) provided by Honeywell. These measure changes to a spacecraft's attitude, and each MIMU contains three ring laser gyroscopes to detect angular changes. Additional attitude information is provided by the star tracker and the SECCHI Guide Telescope. STEREO's onboard computer systems are based on the Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), a device that combines core avionics in a single box. Each single-string spacecraft carries two CPUs, one for command and data handling and one for guidance and control. Both are radiation-hardened 25-megahertz IBM RAD6000 processors, based on POWER1 CPUs (predecessor of the PowerPC chip found in older Macintoshes). The computers, slow by current personal computer standards, are typical for the radiation requirements needed on the STEREO mission. STEREO also carries Actel FPGAs that use triple modular redundancy for radiation hardening. The FPGAs hold the P24 MISC and CPU24 soft microprocessors. For data storage, each spacecraft carries a solid-state recorder able to store up to 1 gigabyte each. Its main processor collects and stores on the recorder images and other data from STEREO's instruments, which can then be sent back to Earth. The spacecraft have an X-band downlink capacity of between 427 and 750 kbit/s.

The T30 was designed at the same time as the T29 Heavy Tank. Early tanks Plans for four pilot heavy tanks were put forward in 1944; two T29 with a 105 mm gun and two T30 with a 155 mm gun. The T30 pilot models were started in April 1945 and were delivered in 1947. Apart from modifications to fit the different engine, the chassis was the same as the T29. The gun fired separate loading (shell and charge) ammunition. The loader was assisted by a spring rammer.Heavy Tank T30 The T30 was fitted with one of the largest guns ever used on an American tank. The notably high, rounded edge, turret was needed to accommodate the standing loader and large gun mount. Even then the gun could only be loaded at limited elevations. It could carry a mixed assortment of 34 T35E1 HVAP (high-velocity armor piercing), M112B1 and T29E1 APCBC-HE (armor-piercing capped ballistic cap high-explosive) M107 HE (high explosive), or M110 WP (Smoke) rounds. Variants One pilot model, designated T30E1, had an automatic system added to load the ammunition. This brought the gun breech into position, loaded the round and then returned the gun to the initial angle. An additional hatch at the back of the turret was added for the automatic ejection of the empty shell casings. The weight of the shell was and the charge , a total of for the whole round, which made it difficult to handle and gave it a rate of fire of only two rounds per minute when manually loaded.

Metabolism in humans While a significant amount of toluene, 25%–40%, is exhaled unchanged via the lungs, a greater proportion is metabolised and excreted via other pathways. The primary route of toluene metabolism is by hydroxylation to benzyl alcohol by members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. There are five CYPs which are important in toluene metabolism, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, and CYP1A1. The first four seem to be involved in the hydroxylation of toluene to benzyl alcohol. CYP2E1 seems to be the primary enzyme in the hydroxylation of toluene, accounting for roughly 44% of toluene metabolism; however, there is a great deal of ethnic variability, in the Finnish population for example the primary enzyme is CYP2B6. CYP2E1 catalyses the formation of benzyl alcohol and p-cresol, while CYP2B6 produces comparatively little p-cresol. It is believed that in humans, benzyl alcohol is metabolised to benzaldehyde by CYP rather than alcohol dehydrogenase; however, this belief does not appear to be universal. Benzaldehyde is in turn metabolised to benzoic acid, primarily by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH-2), while only a small percentage is metabolised by cytosolic ALDH-1. Benzoic acid is metabolised to either benzoyl glucuronide or hippuric acid. Benzoyl glucuronide is produced by the reaction of benzoic acid with glucuronic acid, which accounts for 10–20% of benzoic acid elimination. Hippuric acid is also known as benzoylglycine and is produced from benzoic acid in two steps: first benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl-CoA by the enzyme benzoyl-CoA synthase; then benzoyl-CoA is converted to hippuric acid by benzoyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase. Hippuric acid is the primary urinary metabolite of toluene. centre Ring hydroxylation to cresols is a minor pathway in the metabolism of toluene. The majority of the cresol is excreted unchanged in urine; however, some of the p-cresol and o-cresol is excreted as a conjugate. Studies in rats have shown that p-cresol is primarily conjugated with glucuronide to produce p-cresylglucuronide, though this may not be applicable to humans. o-cresol appears to be excreted mostly unchanged in urine or as the glucuronide or sulfate conjugate. There appears to be some dispute over whether m-cresol is produced as a metabolite of toluene or not. centre Environmental influences When exposure to toluene occurs there is usually simultaneous exposure to several other chemicals. Often toluene exposure occurs in conjunction with benzene and since they are to some degree metabolised by the same enzymes, the relative concentrations will determine their rate of elimination. Of course the longer it takes for toluene to be eliminated the more harm it is likely to do. The smoking and drinking habits of those exposed to toluene will partially determine the elimination of toluene. Studies have shown that even a modest amount of acute ethanol consumption can significantly decrease the distribution or elimination of toluene from the blood resulting in increased tissue exposure. Other studies have shown that chronic ethanol consumption can enhance toluene metabolism via the induction of CYP2E1. Smoking has been shown to enhance the elimination rate of toluene from the body, perhaps as a result of enzyme induction. The diet can also influence toluene elimination. Both a low-carbohydrate diet and fasting have been shown to induce CYP2E1 and as a result increase toluene metabolism. A low protein diet may decrease total CYP content and thereby reduce the elimination rate of the drug. Measure of exposure Hippuric acid has long been used as an indicator of toluene exposure; however, there appears to be some doubt about its validity. There is significant endogenous hippuric acid production by humans; which shows inter- and intra-individual variation influenced by factors such as diet, medical treatment, alcohol consumption, etc. This suggests that hippuric acid may be an unreliable indicator of toluene exposure. It has been suggested that urinary hippuric acid, the traditional marker of toluene exposure is simply not sensitive enough to separate the exposed from the non-exposed. This has led to the investigation of other metabolites as markers for toluene exposure. Urinary o-cresol may be more reliable for the biomonitoring of toluene exposure because, unlike hippuric acid, o-cresol is not found at detectable levels in unexposed subjects. o-Cresol may be a less sensitive marker of toluene exposure than hippuric acid. o-Cresol excretion may be an unreliable method for measuring toluene exposure because o-cresol makes up <1% of total toluene elimination. Benzylmercapturic acid, a minor metabolite of toluene, is produced from benzaldehyde. In more recent years, studies have suggested the use of urinary benzylmercapturic acid as the best marker for toluene exposure, because: it is not detected in non-exposed subjects; it is more sensitive than hippuric acid at low concentrations; it is not affected by eating or drinking; it can detect toluene exposure down to approximately 15 ppm; and it shows a better quantitative relationship with toluene than hippuric acid or o-cresol. Effects of long-term exposure Serious adverse behavioural effects are often associated with chronic occupational exposure and toluene abuse related to the deliberate inhalation of solvents. Long-term toluene exposure is often associated with effects such as: psychoorganic syndrome; visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormality; toxic polyneuropathy, cerebellar, cognitive, and pyramidal dysfunctions; optic atrophy; hearing disorders and brain lesions. The neurotoxic effects of long-term use (in particular repeated withdrawals) of toluene may cause postural tremors by upregulating GABA receptors within the cerebellar cortex. Treatment with GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines provide some relief from toluene-induced tremor and ataxia. An alternative to drug treatment is ventral intermediate nucleus (vim) thalamotomy. The tremors associated with toluene misuse do not seem to be a transient symptom, but an irreversible and progressive symptom which continues after solvent abuse has been discontinued. There is some evidence that low-level toluene exposure may cause disruption in the differentiation of astrocyte precursor cells. This does not appear to be a major hazard to adults; however, exposure of pregnant women to toluene during critical stages of fetal development could cause serious disruption to neuronal development.

As a child, he enjoyed drawing and by the time he was five years old, he would spend hours on end watching Disney videos. He tried to draw the characters that he saw with unusual expressions on their faces. Álvarez received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. Yenny Álvarez enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico after graduating from high school and continued to study art. In 1988, while still a student, he began to draw his first comic strip, Zacha and Anyelin, which was published in the local newspaper. He paid for his college expenses with the money earned. The comic strip eventually became known as \\"Yenny\\". Yenny is a beautiful girl with a pet iguana who wants to become a model; the only problem is that she has enormous feet. With the success of Yenny, Álvarez decided to self-publish a comic book called Changuy with David Martínez, about a Batman- like crow. Warner Bros. Álvarez read in an animation magazine that Warner Bros. was making new projects, among them Space Jam. He sent samples of his work and after a year of waiting was finally contacted and began working for them as a freelance artist. The first story that he drew was an Animaniacs story and the second story was a Sylvester story called \\"Frankentweety\\". Álvarez developed the idea of including cameos of obscure Looney Tunes characters within the storyboard panels. Among the people he has worked with and whom he considers his inspiration are Chuck Jones, Tex Avery and Bob Clampett. He also illustrated a short Chuck Jones tribute story written by Dan Slott. On August 29, 2018, comics with DC villains with the Looney Tunes, which were illustrated by Alvarez, was released. Later years / The ChickenDuck Show / Changuy David Álvarez plans on introducing and publishing his characters in the United States market. He also does freelance work for Disney and other companies. He currently lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico with his wife and child. David also freelanced storyboards for Cartoon Network's Mighty Magiswords created by Kyle Carrozza, whom he frequently collaborates. He also created the character ChickenDuck (based on a character from his strip Kee Kee Koki), made two shorts based on him (with Kyle Carrozza voicing ChickenDuck and other characters in the second short) and made an Indiegogo for a potential online series called \\"The ChickenDuck Show\\".https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-chickenduck-show# A Kickstarter campaign was originally launched but was cancelled in favor for Indiegogo.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/239470603/the-chickenduck- show?ref=nav_search The Indiegogo campaign did not meet its goal but David stated that storyboards for the series is still in the works, hinting that production is still being continued. On June 20, 2019, David Álvarez launched a Kickstarter campaign for a Changuy origin issue entitled Rise of the Chango, which did not reach its initial goal of $3,000.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/changuy/changuy-rise-of-the-chango See also *List of Puerto Ricans References External links  Lambiek Comiclopedia entry * * An Interview With Comic Book Artist David Álvarez *Interview with David Álvarez Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Disney comics artists Category:Puerto Rican comics artists Category:American storyboard artists Category:People from San Juan, Puerto Rico ","title":"David Álvarez (artist)"},{"id":"3394150","text":"The Cave is a student-led music and entertainment venue, located at Carleton College.

He controlled the Casa de Contratación, an agency which managed expeditions to the New World on behalf of the Spanish crown. He later served as the president of the Council of the Indies, when it was founded in 1521. He managed the administration of a number of significant Spanish expeditions including voyages by Christopher Columbus and Magellan's circumnavigation of the earth. Early life Rodríguez de Fonseca was born in 1451 in his family's castle in the town of Toro, in the Province of Zamora, the son of Fernando de Fonseca, lord of the towns of Coca and Alaejos, one of his three children with Teresa de Ayala, daughter of the Marquis of Cañete The family had originated in Portugal and migrated to the Kingdom of Castile a century earlier. As younger sons, he and his brother, Alonso de Fonseca y Acevedo, were destined for careers in the Church. He was the nephew of Alonso de Fonseca y Ulloa, Archbishop of Seville. In the dispute over the claim to the throne between Isabella of Castile and Joanna la Beltraneja, the family pledged their loyalty to Isabella, and helped her to ascend to the throne. With gratitude for his services in this struggle, the young queen recommended Rodríguez de Fonseca to her confessor, the Hieronymite monk, Hernando de Talavera, to educate him in theology and the humanities.la web de las biografías \\"Rodríguez de Fonseca, Juan\\" Rodríguez de Fonseca was ordained a priest on 6 April 1493 in the bishop's palace in Barcelona. He was quickly elected by the cathedral chapter of Seville to join them as a canon of the cathedral. He was soon appointed Dean of the cathedral.Historia del Nuevo Mundo \\"Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, la cabeza del Nuevo Mundo\\" He later served as Vicar General of the archdiocese. Additionally he held the office of Archdeacon for Olmedo, Ávila and Seville. Control of New Spain The sovereigns entrusted Rodríguez de Fonseca with building a colonial administration from as early as Columbus’ second voyage in 1493, which he organized. From that date he gained increasing influence over Castilian colonial policy and emerged as the kingdom’s de facto Minister of Colonial Affairs. Rodríguez de Fonseca clashed early with Columbus who, he believed, was asserting too much independence from royal authority, and in 1499 Queen Isabella, influenced by him, removed Columbus as governor of the newly found lands overseas. Rodríguez de Fonseca then began to plan and organize a series of voyages, under such captains as Alonso de Ojeda, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, Diego de Lepe, and Rodrigo de Bastidas, which steadily expanded new discoveries and increased understanding of the islands and mainland of what quickly became known as a New World. In 1503 Rodríguez de Fonseca organized and supervised an important new institution called the Casa de Contratación, which assumed major responsibilities over the management of the new overseas settlements. He also took the leading role in the evolving Council of the Indies (formally established in 1524), which in time became the most influential royal institution governing the new settlements. Upon the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, an aging King Ferdinand allowed Fonseca almost unlimited scope in administering the overseas colonies. Rodríguez de Fonseca was successively named Bishop of Badajoz (1495), of Córdoba (1499), of Palencia (1504), and, finally, of Burgos (1514), one of Castile’s wealthiest dioceses. In 1519 he was also named Archbishop of Rossano in the Kingdom of Naples.Catholic Hierarchy \\"Archbishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca\\" He was named Count of La Pernía by the monarchs. In 1513 King Ferdinand had asked the pope to elevate Rodríguez to a new title, that of Patriarch of the West Indies, a position that would bring a cardinal’s red hat. But the papacy was reluctant to create this title and the patriarchate was not created until shortly after Fonseca's death. Upon Ferdinand’s death in 1516, Rodríguez de Fonseca continued his work under the new sovereign, King Charles I. He did not enjoy, however, the same confidence he had under the previous monarchs. He rounded off his career by sponsoring and organizing the epic voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, the first one to circumnavigate the globe. Over his long career, Rodríguez de Fonseca inevitably made many enemies, most notably the Dominican bishop, Bartolomé de las Casas, known as the Protector of the Indians, who denounced him for his indifference to the cruelties that Spanish settlers inflicted on the native population of the new lands: when told that 7,000 children had been slaughtered in Cuba in three months, he is said to have retorted \\"and how does that concern me?\\"Diaz, B., 1992, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books. p. xxiii. He also clashed with Hernán Cortés,Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, conqueror of Mexico, which led to Cortes' removal from office in 1523. Death Rodríguez de Fonseca died in Burgos, where he was still bishop, on 4 March 1524. He was buried at the Church of Santa María la Mayor en Coca in Segovia, where his tomb still exists.

Chemistry  In chemistry, \\"activation\\" refers to the reversible transition of a molecule into a nearly identical chemical or physical state, with the defining characteristic being that this resultant state exhibits an increased propensity to undergo a specified chemical reaction. Thus, activation is conceptually the opposite of protection, in which the resulting state exhibits a decreased propensity to undergo a certain reaction. The energy of activation specifies the amount of free energy the reactants must possess (in addition to their rest energy) in order to initiate their conversion into corresponding products—that is, in order to reach the transition state for the reaction. The energy needed for activation can be quite small, and often it is provided by the natural random thermal fluctuations of the molecules themselves (i.e. without any external sources of energy). The branch of chemistry that deals with this topic is called chemical kinetics. Biology =Biochemistry= In biochemistry, activation, specifically called bioactivation, is where enzymes or other biologically active molecules acquire the ability to perform their biological function, such as inactive proenzymes being converted into active enzymes that are able to catalyze their substrates' reactions into products. Bioactivation may also refer to the process where inactive prodrugs are converted into their active metabolites, or the toxication of protoxins into actual toxins. An enzyme may be reversibly or irreversibly bioactivated. A major mechanism of irreversible bioactivation is where a piece of a protein is cut off by cleavage, producing an enzyme that will then stay active. A major mechanism of reversible bioactivation is substrate presentation where an enzyme translocates near its substrate. Another reversible reaction is where a cofactor binds to an enzyme, which then remains active while the cofactor is bound, and stops being active when the cofactor is removed. In protein synthesis, amino acids are carried by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules and added to a growing polypeptide chain on the ribosome. In order to transfer the amino acids to the ribosome, tRNAs must first be covalently bonded to the amino acid through their 3' CCA terminal. This binding is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and requires a molecule of ATP. The amino acid bound to the tRNA is called an aminoacyl-tRNA, and is considered the activated molecule in protein translation. Once activated, the aminoacyl-tRNA may move to the ribosome and add the amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. =Immunology= In immunology, activation is the transition of leucocytes and other cell types involved in the immune system. On the other hand, deactivation is the transition in the reverse direction. This balance is tightly regulated, since a too small degree of activation causes susceptibility to infections, while, on the other hand, a too large degree of activation causes autoimmune diseases. Activation and deactivation results from a variety of factors, including cytokines, soluble receptors, arachidonic acid metabolites, steroids, receptor antagonists, adhesion molecules, bacterial products and viral products.  Electrophysiology  Activation refers to the opening of ion channels, i.e. the conformational change that allows ions to pass.

Photographer Erik Reuterswärd suspected a meteor was depicted in his widely circulated photo. The Swedish Army, who released the picture, was less certain. Ghost rockets (, also called Scandinavian ghost rockets) were rocket- or missile-shaped unidentified flying objects sighted in 1946, mostly in Sweden and nearby countries. The first reports of ghost rockets were made on February 26, 1946, by Finnish observers. About 2,000 sightings were logged between May and December 1946, with peaks on 9 and 11 August 1946. Two hundred sightings were verified with radar returns, and authorities recovered physical fragments which were attributed to ghost rockets. Investigations concluded that many ghost rocket sightings were probably caused by meteors. For example, the peaks of the sightings, on 9 and 11 August 1946, also fall within the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower. However, most ghost rocket sightings did not occur during meteor shower activity, and furthermore displayed characteristics inconsistent with meteors, such as reported maneuverability. Debate continues as to the origins of the unidentified ghost rockets. In 1946, however, it was thought likely that they originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde, and were long-range tests by the Soviets of captured German V-1 or V-2 missiles, or perhaps another early form of cruise missile because of the ways they were sometimes seen to maneuver. This prompted the Swedish Army to issue a directive stating that newspapers were not to report the exact location of ghost rocket sightings, or any information regarding the direction or speed of the object. This information, they reasoned, was vital for evaluation purposes to the nation or nations assumed to be performing the tests. Descriptions and early investigations The early Soviet origins theory was rejected by Swedish, British, and U.S. military investigators because no recognizable rocket fragments were ever found, and according to some sightings, the objects displayed some combination of leaving no exhaust trail, moving too slowly, flying horizontally, traveling and maneuvering in formation, and appearing to be silent. The sightings most often consisted of fast-flying rocket- or missile-shaped objects, with or without wings, visible for mere seconds. Instances of slower moving, cigar-shaped objects are also known. A hissing or rumbling sound was sometimes reported. Crashes were not uncommon, almost always in lakes. Reports were made of objects crashing into a lake, sometimes then propelling themselves across the surface before sinking. The Swedish military performed several dives in the affected lakes shortly after the crashes, but found nothing other than occasional craters in the lake bottom or torn off aquatic plants. Swedish Air Force officer Karl-Gösta Bartoll searches for a \\"ghost rocket\\" seen to crash into Lake Kölmjärv on July 19, 1946. The best known of these crashes occurred on July 19, 1946, into Lake Kölmjärv, Sweden. Witnesses reported a gray, rocket-shaped object with wings crashing in the lake. One witness interviewed heard a thunderclap, possibly the object exploding. However, a 3-week military search reported nothing. Immediately after the investigation, the Swedish Air Force officer who led the search, Karl-Gösta Bartoll submitted a report in which he stated that the bottom of the lake had been disturbed but nothing was recovered and that \\"there are many indications that the Kölmjärv object disintegrated itself...the object was probably manufactured in a lightweight material, possibly a kind of magnesium alloy that would disintegrate easily, and not give indications on our instruments\\".Carpenter chronology When Bartoll was later interviewed in 1984 by Swedish researcher Clas Svahn, he again said their investigation suggested the object largely disintegrated in flight and insisted that \\"what people saw were real, physical objects\\".Randles, 29-30 On October 10, 1946, the Swedish Defense Staff publicly stated, \\"Most observations are vague and must be treated very skeptically. In some cases, however, clear, unambiguous observations have been made that cannot be explained as natural phenomena, Swedish aircraft, or imagination on the part of the observer. Echo, radar, and other equipment registered readings but gave no clue as to the nature of the objects\\". It was also stated that fragments alleged to have come from the missiles were nothing more than ordinary coke or slag.Clark, 247 On December 3, 1946, a memo was drafted for the Swedish Ghost Rocket committee stating \\"nearly one hundred impacts have been reported and thirty pieces of debris have been received and examined by Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA)\\". The debris was later said to be meteorite fragments [reference?]. Of the nearly 1,000 reports that had been received by the Swedish Defense Staff to November 29, 225 were considered observations of \\"real physical objects\\" and every one had been seen in broad daylight.Joel Carpenter chronology U.S. involvement In early August 1946 Swedish Lt. Lennart Neckman of the Defense Staff's Air Defense Division saw something that was \\"without a doubt ... a rocket projectile\\". On August 14, 1946, the New York Times reported that Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson was \\"very much interested\\" in the ghost rocket reports, as was U.S. Army Air Forces intelligence as indicated nonpublicly by later documents (Clark, 246). Then on August 20, the Times reported that two U.S. experts on aerial warfare, aviation legend General Jimmy Doolittle and General David Sarnoff, president of RCA, arrived in Stockholm, ostensibly on private business and independently of each other. The official explanation was that Doolittle, who was now vice-president of the Shell Oil Company, was inspecting Shell branch offices in Europe, while Sarnoff, a former member of General Dwight D. Eisenhower's London staff, was studying the market for radio equipment. However, the Times story indicated that the Chief of the Swedish Defense Staff, made no secret that he \\"was extremely interested in asking the two generals advice and, if possible, would place all available reports before them\\". (Carpenter chronology) Doolittle and Sarnoff were briefed that on several occasions the ghost rockets had been tracked on radar.Clark, 246 Sarnoff was quoted by the N.Y. Times on September 30 saying that he was \\"convinced that the 'ghost bombs' are no myth but real missiles\\". On August 22, 1946, the director of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), Lt. Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, wrote a Top Secret memo to President Truman, perhaps based in part on information from Doolittle and Sarnoff. Vandenberg stated that the \\"weight of evidence pointed to Peenemünde as origin of the missiles, that US MA [military attaché] in Moscow had been told by 'key Swedish Air Officer' that radar course-plotting had led to conclusion that Peenemünde was the launch site. CIG speculates that the missiles are extended- range developments of V-1 being aimed for the Gulf of Bothnia for test purposes and do not overfly Swedish territory specifically for intimidation; self-destruct by small demolition charge or burning\\". Nevertheless, there are no reports of rocket launches at Peenemünde or the Greifswalder Oie after February 21, 1945 (See also: List of V-2 test launches). Swedish military opinion November 1948 USAF Top Secret document citing extraterrestrial opinion Although the official opinion of the Swedish and U.S. military remains unclear, a Top Secret USAFE (United States Air Force Europe) document from 4 November 1948 indicates that at least some investigators believed the ghost rockets and later \\"flying saucers\\" had extraterrestrial origins. Declassified only in 1997, the document states: :\\"For some time we have been concerned by the recurring reports on flying saucers. They periodically continue to pop up; during the last week, one was observed hovering over Neubiberg Air Base for about thirty minutes. They have been reported by so many sources and from such a variety of places that we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence thinking. :\\"When officers of this Directorate recently visited the Swedish Air Intelligence Service, this question was put to the Swedes. Their answer was that some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the conclusion that 'these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth'. They are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the earth\\". The document also mentioned a search for an object crashing in a Swedish lake conducted by a Swedish naval salvage team, with the discovery of a previously unknown crater on the lake floor believed caused by the object (possibly referencing the Lake Kölmjärv search for a ghost rocket discussed above, though the date is unclear). The document ends with the statement that \\"we are inclined not to discredit entirely this somewhat spectacular theory [extraterrestrial origins], meantime keeping an open mind on the subject\\".Good (2007), 106-107, 111; USAFE Item 14, TT 1524, (Top Secret), 4 November 1948, declassified in 1997, National Archives, Washington D.C. Greek government investigation The \\"ghost rocket\\" reports were not confined to Scandinavian countries. Similar objects were also reported early the following month by British Army units in Greece, especially around Thessaloniki. In an interview on September 5, 1946, the Greek Prime Minister, Konstantinos Tsaldaris, likewise reported a number of projectiles had been seen over Macedonia and Thessaloniki on September 1. In mid- September, they were also seen in Portugal, and then in Belgium and northern Italy. The Greek government conducted their own investigation, with their leading scientist, physicist Dr. Paul Santorinis (Παύλος Σαντορίνης), in charge. Santorinis had been a developer of the proximity fuze on the first A-bomb and held patents on guidance systems for Nike missiles and radar systems. Santorinis was supplied by the Greek Army with a team of engineers to investigate what again were believed to be Soviet missiles flying over Greece. In a 1967 lecture to the Greek Astronomical Society, broadcast on Athens Radio, Santorinis first publicly revealed what had been found in his 1947 investigation. \\"We soon established that they were not missiles. But, before we could do any more, the Army, after conferring with foreign officials (presumably U.S. Defense Dept.), ordered the investigation stopped. Foreign scientists [from Washington] flew to Greece for secret talks with me\\". Later Santorinis told UFO researchers such as Raymond Fowler that secrecy was invoked because officials were afraid to admit of a superior technology against which we have \\"no possibility of defense\\".Good (1988), 23; Keyhoe, 142 See also *List of reported UFO sightings *Foo fighter, World War II predecessor of ghost rockets *Operation Backfire (WWII) References * Jerome Clark, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial, 1998, Visible Ink Press, * Timothy Good, Above Top Secret, 1988, William Morrow & Co., * Timothy Good, Need to Know: UFOs, the Military, and Intelligence, 2007, Pegasus Books, * Donald Keyhoe, Aliens From Space, 1973, Doubleday & Co., * Jenny Randles, UFO Retrievals: The Recovery of Alien Spacecraft, 1995, Blandford Press, * Reuben Stone, Alien Worlds, 1993, Longmeadow Press, (Contains photo of search for ghost rocket seen crashing in Lake Kölmjärv) External links *The Ghost Rockets of 1946 - Saturday Night Uforia *Extensive Ghost Rocket chronology by Joel Carpenter on Project 1947 website, many documents and photos. *See Ghost Rockets World Tour by Charles Stankievech for a project that maps the history of ballistics by staging rocket launches at historic sites including Peneemünde, Helsinki, Berlin, Russia, California, Alaska and others. *Ghost Rockets Documentation Project Contains Photos, Video and links to updates of UFO Sweden's investigation. *The Greek Ghost Rockets of 1946 The sightings in Greece and Santorinis' involvement. *\\"Radio Rockets\\" a 1946 Flight news item Category:UFO sightings Category:1946 in Sweden Category:Unidentified flying objects Category:Experimental rockets Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union Category:History of modern Greece Category:1946 in Finland ","title":"Ghost rockets"},{"id":"3394261","text":"Shannon Jay McDonnell (born 5 August 1987) is a former Ireland international rugby league footballer who last played for St Helens in the Super League.

Background He was born in Camden, New South Wales, Australia. Club career =West Tigers= 120px A Umina Bunnies junior, Heighington made his début for Wests Tigers in 2003. He later said, \\"To be honest, I couldn't believe I was making my début. It was a great experience. It came so quickly. I only started the pre-season at the end of 2002.\\" He made seven appearances from the bench that year, and was a backup again in 2004. By 2005 he had cemented his place in the team and played from the interchange bench in the Tigers' 30–16 victory in the 2005 NRL grand final over the North Queensland Cowboys. Following the grand final victory, Heighington was interviewed by Channel 9 sideline commentator Matthew Johns. Johns asked Heighington to describe the feeling of winning the premiership. Heighington replied “Yeah mate it’s fucking awesome, you don’t know how to fucking ... there’s no words for it, it’s just fucking unbelievable\\". In the following days, the Wests Tigers club issued a statement apologising for the inappropriate language used by some of their players. As NRL Premiers Wests faced Super League champions Bradford Bulls in the 2006 World Club Challenge. Heighington played at second-row forward in the Tigers' 30–10 loss. Heighington won the award for Wests Tigers' Player of the Year for 2008.

In 2016, he came off the bench in Cronulla's first premiership win 14-12 over the Melbourne Storm for his second premiership victory. Heighington played his 300th game on 1 April 2017, saying, \\"It’s hard to believe I’m on the same list of 300-game players as him.

Gembrook recorded a population of 2,350 at the 2016 Census. Gembrook is a popular destination for the residents of Melbourne as it is less than 1.5 hours drive from the city centre. History Gembrook was settled in 1873 for farming and timber; the surrounding countryside was suitable for both dairy and orchards. Timber provided income while farms were established. The name Gembrook came from the small gems that were found in small creeks and watercourses in the surrounding area. The Post Office opened on 5 October 1877. Puffing Billy railway 6A at Gembrook. The Gembrook railway line was opened from Upper Ferntree Gully on 18 December 1900. The narrow gauge line, these days known as Puffing Billy, brought tourists from Melbourne, as well as enabling timber and local produce, including fruit trees and potatoes, to be taken back to Melbourne. More than 20 timber mills were operating in the Gembrook area, with timber from the mills transported to the station on narrow gauge timber tramways. After the devastating fires in 1926 and 1939 which destroyed many of the timber mills, there was talk of closing the line. The line eventually closed on 30 April 1954 after a landslide blocked part of the line the previous year (the line was already in decline because motor traffic had replaced much of the railway's patronage). Soon after this time (between 1958 and 1962) the broad gauge line to Upper Ferntree Gully was extended to Belgrave which is less than 18 km away from Gembrook. In 1962, the western end of the Gembrook railway line which extended from Belgrave to Menzies Creek was reopened as a heritage tourist railway. Later extensions to Emerald in 1965, and Lakeside (in Emerald Lake Park) in 1975, were opened and finally the last section to Gembrook in 1998, which saw the complete service resume between Belgrave and Gembrook. A short section from Gembrook towards Cockatoo was gradually reopened in the early 1990s as restoration work progressed. Tourism Tourism in the region developed as a direct result of the railway opening the area up. The Ranges Hotel originally constructed in 1894, was expanded in 1901 to cater for day trippers and excursionists from Melbourne as well as the local population. The Ranges Hotel reopened in 2017 after an extended renovation, including the sale of the hotel. On 24 September 2018 the hotel was destroyed in a fire; the site was cleared and eventually sold, and awaits redevelopment. The historic Kurth Kiln is about 7 km north of the town. Modern Gembrook Today Gembrook is seen by some as a suburb of Melbourne as it is within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Gembrook no longer relies on the income generated from farming and timber but rather from tourism and other professional services. The current population of Gembrook is over 2,000. The town is located within the Shire of Cardinia, and is within the state electoral area of Gembrook, and the federal electorate area of La Trobe. Gembrook is served by a regular daily bus service running from/to Belgrave (route 695). A Friday evening and Saturday/Sunday service also runs from/to Fountain Gate shopping centre at Narre Warren (route 695F). A daily (excluding Sundays) service runs from/to Pakenham (route 840). Together with its neighbouring township Cockatoo, Gembrook has an Australian Rules football team (Gembrook Cockatoo) competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League. Gembrook is known as a major winemaking region, containing several well-known wineries. The town is also home to the Gillwell Park Scout Camp one of the largest scout camps in the southern hemisphere.

Mongolian Horse Archers First Khan of the White Horde Orda Ichen (c. 1206-1251 CE) is credited for founding the White Horde; he was the eldest son of Jochi and the first grandson of Genghis Khan. At the death of his father and grandfather, Orda Khan inherited the Eastern portions of his father's lands; while he was the elder, he nevertheless agreed that his younger brother Batu Khan ruled the whole Golden Horde (also known as the Jochid Ulus). This mainly consisted of the territories between Lake Balkhash and the Volga river; it was in these lands that Orda eventually founded the White Horde. West of the Volga river were the lands of his younger brother Batu, who became the first ruler of the Blue Horde and the supreme khan of the Golden Horde. Güyük Khan ordered Temuge Otchigin, who tried to illegally usurp the throne for himself, to be investigated by Orda and Möngke in c. 1246. Family tree origins rightHoelun from the Olkhunut of Onggirat tribe was supposed to marry a Mergid warrior called Yehe Chiledu, but Yesugei Baghatur from the Khiyad tribe abducted Hoelun while she was traveling from the Onggirat to the Mergid. This event triggered hostilities between the Mergit and Khiyad tribes. Temüjin was born from the marriage between Hoelun and Yesugei. When Temüjin became 16 years old he married Börte Ujin from the Onggirat tribe, the Mergids took revenge by abducting Börte when Temüjin was 18. Temüjin formed an alliance with his blood brother Jamuha and his foster-father Toghril, the Mergids were defeated by the alliance which Temüjin had formed and his wife Börte was reclaimed. Jochi supposedly was born shortly after Börte was liberated and Genghis Khan always accepted Jochi as his first-born son, but to some it remained uncertain whether Temüjin Borjigin or Chilger Bökh was the real father of Jochi. As Genghis Khan's first-born son, Jochi was favored as rightful heir to the Mongol Empire. It was Chagatai who brought up the dispute of Jochi's illegitimacy, but Genghis Khan remained determined that Jochi was his legitimate first-born son. It was when Genghis named Ögedei as his rightful successor that Jochi rebelled against his father, Chagatai and Ögedei were sent against Jochi who died in February 1227 before it came to any hostilities. Jochi's descendants were the oldest branch of the Genghis Khan family, although they were not favored for succession by other rivaling family members. Younger brothers Orda Ichen was the first-born son of Jochi, his younger brothers were Batu, Berke, Shayban, Sinkur, Toga-Timur and Baul-Teval. After the death of Genghis Khan the Mongol empire was divided into four sub- khanates, after the invasion of Europe four other Khanates also established within the empire; the princes of the left wing commanded by Orda Khan, the Blue Horde commanded by Batu Khan, Sibirean Khanate commanded by Shayban and a Khanate on the upper reaches of the Volga river centered on Volga Bulgaria commanded by Toga-Timur (which later became known as the Qasim Khanate). All these were brothers of each other and Orda Khan was the oldest, Orda was known to have participated in the massive Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1237-1242. His younger brother, Batu Khan, claimed his authority over the Jochid Hordes in accordance with Orda's wish. Invasion of Poland Subutai & Batu Khan led two armies against Hungary, while Orda Khan with Chagatai's sons Baidar & Kadan attacked Poland as a diversion to prevent the Poles and Czechs from assisting Hungary in combat. Orda's forces assaulted the southwestern border of Lithuania, then sacked the cities of Sandomierz and Kraków in April 1241, but were unable to conquer Wrocław (Breslau), the capital of Lower Silesia. While Orda was preparing siege on Wrocław, Baidar and Kadan received glowing reports that king Wenceslaus I of Bohemia was two days away with an army of 50,000 soldiers. Orda Khan broke off the siege and turned to Legnica where he intercepted the military forces of Henry II the Pious, before there could be any kind of merging between the forces of Henry II and the forces of king Wenceslaus I. Orda's deployment of 20,000 mounted archers demonstrated speed & tactical superiority versus the slower more heavily armored European armies, series of deceptive Mongolian attacks separated the Polish formation making them vulnerable for salvoes of Mongolian arrows. A smoke screen was used to conceal Mangudai's feigned retreat, thereby misleading Henry's military forces. After the European knights pursued the fleeing Mangudai, the Mongols were able to separate the knights from the infantry and defeated them one by one. Henry II the Pious was intercepted while trying to escape the battlefield, his head was paraded on a spear while marching through the town of Legnica. King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia arrived at the battle field too late. When he heard that one Mongol group raided as far as the Saxonian town Meissen (Mongol raid on Meissen, Germany) Powell, James M. \\"Crusade and Christendom Annotated Documents in translation from Innocent III to the fall of Acre, 1187-1291\\", p. 312. promptly marched there and seek reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony. Meanwhile, rapid Mongol troops returned to the East (i.e. Central Silesia) and tried attack Bohemia via Kłodzko Land but they were stopped at the border. Afterwards Orda with Mangudai joined the forces of Kadan and Baidar at Otmuchów (Otmachau) and together quickly passing through Moravia (which was severely looted and devastated) joining with the main Mongolian army in Hungary around the city of Esztergom. Death Orda Khan died in 1251 before he could consolidate his ülüs (district). After his death his grandson Köchü extended the line of successors for the White Horde. =Descendants= Very little is known about Orda's wife and children, however his dynastic lines lived on for many generations. His early successors were friendly towards Ilkhanate and Yuan emperors. Urus the eighth Khan of the White Horde was a direct descendant of Orda khan, Urus Khan became the leader of both the Blue and White Horde. Tokhtamysh was one of Orda's descendants, he dethroned the Batukhanids and ascended the throne of the Golden Horde in the late 14th century.

Made famous in 1925 by his poster for the Revue Nègre, which helped to launch the career of Josephine Baker (who became his mistress), he worked for over forty years in the theatre, creating not only posters but also numerous sets and costumes. Very Art déco at the outset, (his Le Tumulte noir is a masterpiece of the genre), his style quickly became highly personal and impossible to categorize: the synthetic accuracy of his portraits, the evocative force of his posters for grand causes so marked him as a master of visual communication that his work today remains relevant and fresh. A student of Eugène Vallin and of Victor Prouvé, he is considered a master of the modern school of poster art. He is the author of more thab 1,400 posters and many theatrical set and costume designs. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

It had approximately 90 members, including electricity generation companies and those offering support services. History The Association was founded in 1987 as the Association of Independent Electricity Producers, with the initial remit of lobbying the UK government's Department of Energy to remove restrictions on private companies operating within the electricity industry. The idea for the AIEP came from David Andrews who was an engineer promoting small scale Combined Heat and Power - mini- CHP who was frustrated by the blatant attempts of the then CEGB to manipulate the market against mini-CHP. He called the first meeting held at Orchard Partners in London, then also active in promoting CHP, with John Macadam of Orchard Partners and Martin Alder then of Wessex Water and Trevor Dooley of Electrical Review who provided valuable initial publicity. Early on Andrews suggested that a contact, David Porter, who had a small desk top publishing business provide a newsletter - Porter went on to become the Director and Chief Executive. =Electricity privatisation= This early goal, against the CEGB, was achieved with the passing of the Electricity Act in 1989, and the subsequent full privatisation of the industry (with the exception of nuclear power). In 1995, recognising that little remained from which the organisation could be \\"independent\\", it changed its name to the Association of Electricity Producers. In 1999 it moved to its current offices in London. It used to be based further towards Pall Mall on Waterloo Place. Harby in Nottinghamshire Structure The Association employed 12 staff. Its President was Sir Michael Spicer former MP, and David Porter was its Chief Executive from 1991. The UK electricity industry is worth £54 million, and directly employs 87,000 people.

The Senate is the upper house, and consists of 80 members, 60 of whom are elected by proportional representation from ten six-member constituencies corresponding to the country's provinces. Of the remaining 20 seats, 18 are reserved for chiefs, and two for people with disabilities. The National Assembly is the lower house, and consists of 270 members. Of these, 210 are elected from single-member constituencies. The remaining 60 seats are reserved for women, and are elected by proportional representation from ten six-member constituencies corresponding to the country's provinces. The first legislature in what is now Zimbabwe was the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council, established in 1898 in what was then the British South Africa Company territory of Southern Rhodesia. Company rule in Rhodesia ended in 1923 when the territory became a self-governing colony, and the Legislative Council was replaced by the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly. In 1970, five years after the colony's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Rhodesia replaced the unicameral Legislative Assembly with a bicameral Parliament, consisting of a Senate and House of Assembly. This parliamentary structure was retained upon Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Per the constitution produced by Lancaster House Agreement in 1979, the Senate was composed of 40 seats and the House of Assembly was composed of 100, with ten Senate seats and 20 seats in the House of Assembly reserved for white Zimbabweans. The white-reserved seats were abolished in 1987, and a constitutional amendment in 1989 abolished the Senate and expanded the House of Assembly to 120 seats. In 2005, the Senate was reintroduced and the House of Assembly expanded. The House of Assembly was expanded once again in 2007 to 210 seats. The present parliamentary structure has been in place since the adoption of a new constitution in 2013. The Senate is presided over by the President, who is assisted by a Deputy President. The National Assembly is presided over by a Speaker, who is not a Member of Parliament. The Speaker is assisted by a Deputy Speaker. The 9th Parliament of Zimbabwe is the current Parliament since the 2018 general election. The Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front, the ruling party since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, holds supermajorities in both chambers of Parliament.

It was first shown by Harold Hotelling, and is widely used in the theory of the firm. The lemma can be stated as: The change in profits from a change in price is proportional to the quantity produced. :\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\pi (p)}{\\\\partial p} = y(p) For \\\\pi the profit function of the firm n terms of the good's price p and y the production function in terms of the good's price p, assuming that p > 0 and that derivative exists. Proof for Hotelling's lemma The proof of the theorem stems from the fact that for a profit-maximizing firm an under duality, the maximum of the firm's profit at some output y^*(p) is given by the minimum of p^* y^*(p) - \\\\pi (p^*) = wx which is the cost at some price, p^*, namely where \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\pi (p)}{\\\\partial p} - y = 0 holds. Thus, y(p)= \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\pi (p)}{\\\\partial p}; QED. The proof is also a corollary of the envelope theorem. Application of Hotelling's lemma Let the firm's profit function be: :\\\\pi=py- wx where: *\\\\pi is profit *p is the price of output y *y is output *w is input price for input x *x is the single input needed for producing y If a firm produces 10 units of y using 5 units of input x which cost 1 dollar each and sells each output for 2 dollars. the profit the firm makes is: :\\\\pi_1=(2)(10)-(1)(5)=15 If the firm increases the price of the output to 3 dollars and still sells the same amount of y, the firm's profits are now: :\\\\pi_2=(3)(10)-(1)(5)=25 Taking the difference between \\\\pi_1 and \\\\pi_2 :\\\\Delta \\\\pi=\\\\pi_2-\\\\pi_1=25-15=10 The change in profits from a change in price is 10, which is exactly the same as the output produced. thus the statement of y(p)= \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\pi (p)}{\\\\partial p} holds.  Criticisms and empirical evidence  A number of criticisms have been made with regards to the use and application of Hotelling's lemma in empirical work. C.Robert Taylor points out that the accuracy of Hotelling's lemma is dependent on the firm maximizing profits, meaning that it is producing profit maximizing output y^* and cost minimizing input x^*. If a firm is not producing at these optima, then Hotelling's lemma would not hold.

Schepmann was an Obergruppenführer in the Nazi Party para- military branch known as the Sturmabteilung (SA) when he was appointed by Adolf Hitler to succeed Viktor Lutze as Stabschef (SA) in 1943. Lutze had died in May that year, after a serious car accident. However, by then the SA had been thoroughly marginalized as far as political power in Nazi Germany. Since January 1939, the role of the SA was officially mandated as a training school for the German armed forces with the establishment of the SA Wehrmannschaften (SA Military Units). Then with the September 1939 invasion of Poland, the SA lost most of its remaining members to military service in the Wehrmacht (armed forces).McNab, Chris. Hitler's Elite: The SS 1939–45, Osprey Publishing, 2013, pp. 20–22. The SA officially ceased to exist in May 1945 when Nazi Germany was defeated and surrendered. The SA was banned by the Allied Control Council shortly after Germany's capitulation. In 1946, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg formally judged the SA not to be a criminal organization.  Early life  Wilhelm Schepmann was born June 1894 in the German city of Hattingen. After attending the Gymnasium (secondary school), Wilhelm Schepmann completed the teacher’s seminar and then worked as a teacher in Hattingen. He served in the First World War from 1914 to 1918 as a soldier of the Westphalian hunter battalion No.7 and was deployed on both the western and eastern fronts. During the war, he was first company commander in the rank of lieutenant of the reserve, then battalion adjutant, and finally court officer. During the war he was wounded, receiving the Wound Badge (1918) in Black and Iron Cross 2nd class.  Political career  Schepmann joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) (No. 26.762) in 1925. Together with Viktor Lutze, he organized the formation of the SA in the Ruhr area and as early as 1928 he was a local Party leader. At the same time, he worked as an NSDAP city councillor and as an SA leader in Hattingen where he contributed significantly to making the city one of the strongholds of the Nazis in the Ruhr area. From 1932 to 1933 Schepmann was a member of the Prussian Landtag and from November 1933 a member of the Reichstag. He worked as a leader of the SA subgroup Westphalia- South in the rank of SA superintendent. From November 1932 he took over the leadership of the SA Group Westfalen. In February 1933 he was appointed police president of Dortmund. On 1 April 1934 he became the leader of the SA Group X (Niederrhein and Westphalia). In the wake of the Night of the Long Knives, Schepmann took over the leadership of the SA Group in Saxony from November 1934 onwards. In March 1936 Schepmann was commissioned to manage the position of the Kreishauptmann (district governor) of Dresden-Bautzen and received the appointment as district governor three months later. Subsequently, until August 1943, Schepmann served as the President of the Dresden-Bautzen district. After the accidental death of Viktor Lutze on 2 May 1943, Max Jüttner took over the interim position of SA Chief of Staff. In August 1943 Schepmann became the Chief of Staff of the SA, although his promotion was not supported by all Party leaders. He held this position until the end of the war in Europe. Sturmabteilung leader Schepmann as Stabschef Schepmann began working to restore the morale and the esteem of the SA. He managed to have units in the army (Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle), Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe (Jagdgeschwader 6 Horst Wessel) given SA honour titles, and even a Waffen-SS division (18. SS Freiwilligen-Panzergrenadier-Division Horst Wessel). On 26 September 1944, Schepmann was appointed Chief of Staff for the German Volkssturm’s Shooting Training (Inspekteur der Schießausbildung im Deutschen Volkssturm).  Post-war  After the end of the war in Europe, Schepmann lived under an assumed name (\\"Schumacher\\") in Gifhorn and worked as a material manager in the district hospital. In April 1949 he was recognized and arrested by the British Secret Intelligence Service, and tried before a Dortmund jury at the end of June 1950. He was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment, appealed and was released in 1954. In the denazification process, he was classified as unloaded (category V) in April 1952. Schepmann wanted to pursue his previous work as a teacher again, but this was refused by the Lower Saxony Ministry of Education.

MALT is populated by lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells, as well as plasma cells and macrophages, each of which is well situated to encounter antigens passing through the mucosal epithelium. In the case of intestinal MALT, M cells are also present, which sample antigen from the lumen and deliver it to the lymphoid tissue. MALT constitute about 50% of the lymphoid tissue in human body. Categorization The components of MALT are sometimes subdivided into the following: * GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Peyer's patches are a component of GALT found in the lining of the small intestines.) * BALT (bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue) * NALT (nasal- associated lymphoid tissue) * CALT (conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue) * LALT (larynx-associated lymphoid tissue) * SALT (skin-associated lymphoid tissue) * VALT (vulvo-vaginal-associated lymphoid tissue) * TALT (testis- associated lymphoid tissue) It can be also distinguished by level of organization of the tissue: * O-MALT (organized mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue); specifically, the tonsils of Waldeyer's tonsillar ring are O-MALT.Gray's Anatomy, 38ed. p. 1442 ff. * D-MALT (diffuse mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue); MALT that is not organized as a separately macroscopically anatomically identifiable mass, tissue or organ (such as the aforementioned O-MALT) is diffuse MALT. Role in disease MALT plays a role in regulating mucosal immunity. It may be the site of lymphomas, usually a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A specific entity is the marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (a subtype of which is termed MALT lymphoma). Certain subtypes of marginal zone B cell lymphomas such as those occurring in the stomach are commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.

He previously played for the Newcastle Knights, the Wests Tigers and the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League, and the Widnes Vikings in the Super League. Craigie primarily played as a , as well as a and . Craigie's career was cut short due to ongoing injuries. Personal life Craigie is the eldest of three children. Craigie was born into a family with a long line of Rugby League players. Playing career While attending Hamilton St. Francis Xavier, Craigie played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1994, 1995 and 1996. He is the only player to make the team three years running. Danny Buderus described him as, \\"the most freakish talent I came across in my junior days.\\" =Newcastle Knights= Craigie made his first grade début in 1995 against the Brisbane Broncos as a seventeen-year-old while he was still attending school, and in his four years at the Knights he often displayed his brilliant natural ability and skill. He scored 32 tries for the Knights, and was a member of the 1997 premiership winning team. Andrew Johns said he was the \\"best naturally talented player I played with.\\" During the 1997 season, Craigie complained that he had been racially vilified during a match against North Sydney Bears. Offending player, Chris Caruana was dropped from the Norths team and was fined. At the end of the 1999 season, Craigie's contract had ended and he was quickly signed by the Wests Tigers. =Wests Tigers= Craigie played for two seasons at the Tigers, but his problems only grew as he spent a large time on the sidelines. His two seasons were cut short by on several occasions by many niggling injuries, as well as his previous problems of form and fitness he had battled at the Knights, and as a result his contract was not renewed. =South Sydney Rabbitohs= In 2002, the South Sydney Rabbitohs signed Craigie on a two-year deal in the hope that his fitness problems could be overcome and he could further display his ability he had shown in glimpses at his two previous clubs. In his first season at the southern Sydney side, he started twenty one of the twenty four games the Rabbitohs played in their season, and things finally looked to be on the up for Craigie. However, with new coach Paul Langmack taking over at the Rabbitohs in 2004, Craigie only began two of the first twelve games of the season. Craigie publicly accused Langmack of being racist, which was denied by Langmack. Not long after Langmack was released from the club, with Arthur Kitinas being appointed as head coach. With a new coach at the helm Craigie began to prosper again, and the Rabbitohs won the next three of their four matches, including a win over 2003 premiers the Penrith Panthers in which Craigie was awarded man of the match. =Widnes Vikings= For the 2005 season, Craigie signed for English Super League club Widnes Vikings. However, injuries, family troubles and fitness problems meant that his new beginning never really lifted to the heights that the English club had hoped and wished for. Midway through the Super League season Craigie and the club came to a mutual agreement to terminate his contract after he suffered a serious knee injury. Craigie quickly moved back to Australia.

It was discovered on 22 October 1968, by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was named for WWII partisan Vera Voloshina.  Classification and orbit  Voloshina orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,009 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. In March 1926, Voloshina was first observed as at Yerkes Observatory and one day later at Heidelberg Observatory. Its observation arc begins at Heidelberg, 62 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Voloshina has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan- STARRS photometric survey. = Lightcurves = In May 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Voloshina was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory () in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 5.896 hours with a brightness variation of 0.40 magnitude (). In January and February 2014, astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory found a period of and hours with an amplitude of 0.32 and 0.27 magnitude, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Voloshina measures between 21.19 and 34.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0698 and 0.120. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0487 and calculates a diameter of 34.67 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.2.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Vera Danilovna Voloshina (1919–1941), a partisan of the Soviet Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), also known as the Eastern Front of the Second World War. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 September 1978 ().

The film won the 1985 Grammy Award for \\"Best Video, Short form\\" (Later renamed \\"Best Music Video\\"), which proved to be Bowie's only competitive Grammy Award during his lifetime. Plot The film depicts the adventures of the socially incompetent Vic (played by Bowie) as he tries to win the affections of a beautiful girl by claiming to personally know her favourite rock star, Screaming Lord Byron (also played by Bowie). Rightfully disbelieving him, she challenges Vic to introduce her to him. They make a date for a Screaming Lord Byron show, where Vic attempts to sneak backstage to convince a cowering, paranoid Mr. Screaming to come say hello to him and the girl after the show. Screaming does come to Vic's table after the show and says hello to him and the girl, but the girl and Screaming Lord Byron have already met (in Peru), and she leaves with the rock star instead of Vic. As they drive off, Bowie breaks the fourth wall and asks the director why the story changed from his concept.

The video footage playing in the pub is from the performance in the club at the conclusion of the film. Bowie takes the opportunity at several points in this film to poke fun at himself and his career – particularly his history of drug abuse, his relationships with groupies, and the commercialization of his music (\\"You conniving, randy, bogus-Oriental old queen! Your record sleeves are better than your songs!\\"). Kinder self-references are also present, such as the song \\"Warszawa\\" being played backstage to soothe Mr. Screaming while he's applying his makeup.

It is slightly modified: in the club where the girl is watching a Screaming Lord Byron video, the screen originally showed footage of the very same concert she and Vic would later attend. On the DVD version, a different promotional video for the song is overlaid on the screen – this is also the trigger for another easter egg, which is itself that alternate video. The portion of the movie where Screaming Lord Byron performs the song \\"Blue Jean\\" in front of the crowd was used as the standard-length music video and clocks in at just over three minutes.

He was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000 for his work on the film Malèna. Early years and career Born at the beginning of the Cold War, he became interested in film at a very young age, though in Hungary at the time, film containing subversive content was heavily censored. He shot his first short on a Super 8 film camera at the age of 14 and began to draft short scripts and turn them into movies starring friends and family. One year he won first and second prizes at a local amateur film festival, and coincidentally another young filmmaker, István Szabó, was the head of the jury. Koltai graduated from the School of Drama and Film in Budapest, a school known for nurturing such legends as Vilmos Zsigmond and László Kovács. Collaboration with István Szabó Still early in his career he gained international recognition during his collaborations with Szabó, namely his film Mephisto, which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the cult political classic \\"Angi Vera\\" by Pal Gabor. At this point the international film community was starting to take notice of these Eastern European films. While Hollywood was at the peak of creativity a decade before after several decades of turning out films that didn't face the same restrictions as in these parts of the world, the Hungarian artistic spirit was beginning to find its place in the world, and many Hungarian directors were confronting truths about their country's tainted Nazi-affiliated history . What followed was several artistic and political masterpieces, the teen-oriented Time Stands Still (1982), a film many considered to be well ahead of its time, Cannes Film Festival winner Colonel Redl (1985), which garnered yet another Oscar nomination, and Hanussen, another political drama loosely based on the rise of Hitler. In 1995 at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival he won the Special Silver St. George for the Director of Photography for his work on the film Mario and the Magician. Work in Hollywood Around this time Koltai decided to make the move to the United States, a dramatic departure for any European filmmaker, let alone cinematographer, though clearly many opportunities lied in the Hollywood playing field. So he joined the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) and began to compile an impressive body of work, notably Luis Mandoki's White Palace, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, Born Yesterday, When a Man Loves a Woman, Just Cause, Jodie Foster's Home for the Holidays, and Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's last film together Out to Sea. While none of these films had a particularly signature or even beautiful style (save perhaps Mandoki's White Palace), due to the cookie-cutter industry standards Hollywood notoriously places over artistic license, it was around this time that another fateful collaboration took place, and that would be with Giuseppe Tornatore, the legendary director of Cinema Paradiso. The Legend of 1900 would be their first film together, a story about a piano player who was born and raised on a steam boat. Tornatore brought out some of Koltai's best work by allowing an actual creative collaboration to take place on set, instead of the cinematographer just taking orders from the director, and the result is what many (including Koltai himself) consider to be his most beautiful work. This led to a career high for any cinematographer, being nominated for an Academy Award for Tornatore's sweeping love story Malèna in 2000. Fateless In 2004 Koltai directed his first film, the Holocaust drama Fateless (Sorstalanság), based on the novel by the same name by Nobel Prize winning writer Imre Kertész. It was released in Hungary in February 2005 with moderate success and it was released in the United States in the fall of 2005. It has had much exposure and success on the film festival circuit premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Chicago Film Festival, the Los Angeles Film Festival, the Washington Jewish Film Festival, The Boston Jewish Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Berlinale, or Berlin Film Festival, where it was nominated for the prestigious Golden Berlin Bear, and countless others. It was also nominated for Best Score (Ennio Morricone) and Best Cinematography (Gyula Pados) at the European Film Awards, and Hungary nominated it for the 2006 Academy Awards, but out of the list of 58 countries as potential nominees for Best Foreign Film, it didn't make it to the final five. Recent work As of 15 February 2006: Koltai finalized his first American directing deal for Focus Features, on the film Evening, scripted by Susan Minot (Stealing Beauty) and Michael Cunningham (The Hours). Shooting took place summer 2006 in Rhode Island. Actresses Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Vanessa Redgrave and Meryl Streep star in the movie. Koltai's next projects are Aline & Wolfe, and Spider Dance. The former, which is scheduled to commence principal photography in 2009, tells the story of American writer Thomas Wolfe (1900–1938, Look Homeward, Angel) and his tumultuous affair with the much older and married arts patron and Broadway set designer Aline Bernstein, who is credited with inspiring Wolfe's writing career. Spider Dance is based upon the life of Lola Montez; focusing on her travels in Australia and is set for release in Christmas 2010.

She was the first female leader of Sinn Féin and was the first Irishwoman to lead a political party. Early life Originally from Cork, she joined Inghinidhe na hÉireann, which was founded in 1900, taking an active role in the women's movement. She was involved in anti-British royal visit protests in 1903 and 1907 and was among the group that founded An Dún in Cork in 1910. In 1906, she married Patrick Buckley, described as \\"a typical rugby-playing British civil servant\\". After his death she moved into a house in Marguerite Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. Later, she returned to Cork to care for her elderly father. Revolutionary Arrested in the aftermath of Easter Rising she was released in the amnesty of June 1917 and played a prominent role in the reorganisation of Sinn Féin. She was involved in the War of Independence in Cork.Sinn Féin A Hundred Turbulent Years by Brian Feeney p178 After the death of her father, she returned to Dublin. In 1920, she became a Dáil Court judge in the North city circuit, appointed by Austin Stack, the Minister for Home Affairs of the Irish Republic. She opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was interned in Mountjoy and Kilmainham, where she went on a hunger strike. She was released in October 1923. During her imprisonment, she was elected Officer Commanding (OC) of the republican prisoners in Mountjoy, Quartermaster (QM) in the North Dublin Union and OC of B-Wing in Kilmainham. She was an active member of the Women Prisoners' Defence League, founded by Maud Gonne and Charlotte Despard in 1922. In 1929, she served as a member of Comhairle na Poblachta which unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the differences between Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army. Buckley was also an organiser for the Irish Women Workers' Union. President of Sinn Féin At the October 1934 Sinn Féin ardfheis, she was elected one of the party's vice-presidents. Three years later in 1937 she succeeded Cathal Ó Murchadha who was a former TD of the second Dáil Éireann as President of Sinn Féin, at an ardfheis attended by only forty delegates, making her the first Irishwoman to lead a political party. When she assumed the leadership of Sinn Féin, the party was not supported by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had severed its links with the party in 1925. When she left the office in 1950, relations with the IRA had been resolved. As President she began the lawsuit Buckley v. Attorney-General, the Sinn Féin Funds case, in which the party sought unsuccessfully to be recognised as owners of money raised by Sinn Féin before 1922 and held in trust in the High Court since 1924. In 1938, she published her book The Jangle of the Keys about the experiences of Irish Republican women prisoners interned by the Irish Free State. In 1956, her book Short History of Sinn Féin was published. She served as honorary vice-president of Sinn Féin from 1950 until her death in 1962. She was the only member of the ardchomairle of the party not to be arrested during a police raid in July 1957. She died on 24 July 1962 and is buried in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.

It is a cancer originating from B cells in the marginal zone of the MALT, and is also called extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma. Diagnosis and staging MALT lymphoma is an often multifocal disease in the organ of origin and is frequently macroscopically indistinguishable from other disease processes in the GI tract. Endoscopy is key to diagnosing MALT lymphoma, with multiple biopsies of the visible lesions required, as well as samples of macroscopically normal tissue, termed gastric mapping. Histologically, there is expansion of the marginal zone compartment with development of sheets of neoplastic small lymphoid cells. The morphology of the neoplastic cells is variable with small mature lymphocytes, cells resembling centrocytes (centrocyte like cells), or marginal zone/monocytoid B cells. Plasmacytoid or plasmacytic differentiation is frequent. Lymphoid follicles are ubiquitous to MALT lymphoma but may be indistinct as they are often overrun or colonized by the neoplastic cells. Large transformed B cells are present scattered among the small cell population. If these large cells are present in clusters or sheets, a diagnosis of associated large B-cell lymphoma should be considered. A characteristic feature of MALT lymphoma is the presence of neoplastic cells within epithelial structures with associated destruction of the glandular architecture to form lymphoepithelial lesions. MALT lymphoma may be difficult to distinguish from reactive infiltrates, and in some cases, multiple endoscopies are required before a confident diagnosis is reached. The Wotherspoon score, which grades the presence of histological features associated with MALT lymphoma, is useful in expressing confidence in diagnosis at presentation. Immunohistochemistry can be used to help distinguish MALT lymphoma from other small B-cell NHLs. B-cell-associated antigens such as CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD79a are usually expressed. In contrast to small lymphocytic lymphoma and MCL, staining for CD5 is usually negative, and these lymphomas can be further distinguished with CD23 (positive in small lymphocytic lymphoma) and CyclinD1 (positive in MCL).  Associations  Gastric MALT lymphoma is frequently associated (72–98%) with chronic inflammation as a result of the presence of Helicobacter pylori, potentially involving chronic inflammation, or the action of H. pylori virulence factors such as CagA. The initial diagnosis is made by biopsy of suspicious lesions on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, upper endoscopy). Simultaneous tests for H. pylori are also done to detect the presence of this microbe. In other sites, chronic immune stimulation is also suspected in the pathogenesis (e.g. association between chronic autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and MALT lymphoma of the salivary gland and the thyroid).  Treatment  Due to the causal relationship between H. pylori infection and MALT lymphoma, identification of the infection is imperative. Histological examination of GI biopsies yields a sensitivity of 95% with five biopsies, but these should be from sites uninvolved by lymphoma and the identification of the organism may be compromised by areas of extensive intestinal metaplasia. As proton-pump inhibition can suppress infection, any treatment with this class of drug should be ceased 2 weeks prior to biopsy retrieval. Serology should be performed if histology is negative, to detect suppressed or recently treated infections. Following the recognition of the association of gastric MALT lymphoma with H. pylori infection, it was established that early-stage gastric disease could be cured by H. pylori eradication, which is now the mainstay of therapy. Fifty to 95% of cases achieve complete response (CR) with H. pylori treatment. A t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation, giving rise to an API2-MLT fusion gene, is predictive of poor response to eradication therapy. = Radiotherapy = Radiotherapy is a valid first option for MALT lymphoma. It provides local control and potential cure in localized gastric stage IE and II 1E disease with 5-year EFS of 85-100% reported in retrospective studies. However, the irradiation field is potentially large as it must include the whole stomach, which can vary greatly in size and shape. Irradiation techniques have improved considerably in the last 20 years, including treating the patient in a fasting state, decreasing the irradiated field and required dose. The moderate dose of 30 Gray (Gy) of involved-field radiotherapy administered in 15 fractions (doses) can be associated with tolerable toxicity and excellent outcomes. Hence, radiotherapy is the preferred approach for local disease where antibiotic therapy has failed, or is not indicated. Evidence also suggests that radiotherapy can be utilized to control localized relapses outside the original radiation field. = Chemotherapy = MALT lymphoma is exquisitely immunotherapy sensitive. Chemotherapy is reserved for those uncommon patients with disseminated disease at presentation or lack of response to local treatment. Rituximab, the anti-CD20 chimeric antibody, is a key component of therapy. Responses vary from 55% to 77% with monotherapy and 100% in combination with chemotherapy. Oral alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil have been administered for a median duration of 12 months with high rates of disease control (CR up to 75%) but appear not to be active in t(11;18) disease. The purine nucleoside analogs fludarabine and cladribine also demonstrate activity, the latter conferring a CR rate of 84% (100% in those with gastric primaries) in a small study. A pivotal study of rituximab plus chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone (IELSG-19 study, n = 227) demonstrated a significantly higher CR rate (78% vs. 65%; p = 0.017) and 5-year EFS (68% vs. 50%; p = 0.024) over chlorambucil alone. However, 5-year OS was not improved (88% in both arms). First-line treatment of choice is generally rituximab in combination with single alkylating agents or fludarabine, or a combination of all three drugs. The final results of this study, including the later addition of a rituximab-alone arm, are pending. Two other genetic alterations are known: * t(1;14)(p22;q32), which deregulates BCL10, at the locus 1p22. * t(14;18)(q32;q21), which deregulates MALT1, at the locus 18q21. These seem to turn on the same pathway as API2-MLT (i.e., that of NF-κB). They both act upon IGH, which is at the locus 14q32.

The dioptra was a sighting tube or, alternatively, a rod with a sight at both ends, attached to a stand. If fitted with protractors, it could be used to measure angles. Use Greek astronomers used the dioptra to measure the positions of stars; both Euclid and Geminus refer to the dioptra in their astronomical works. It continued in use as an effective surveying tool. Adapted to surveying, the dioptra is similar to the theodolite, or surveyor's transit, which dates to the sixteenth century. It is a more accurate version of the groma. The dioptra may have been sophisticated enough, for example, to construct a tunnel through two opposite points in a mountain. There is some speculation that it may have been used to build the Eupalinian aqueduct. Called \\"one of the greatest engineering achievements of ancient times,\\" it is a tunnel 1,036 meters (4,000 ft) long, \\"excavated through Mount Kastro on the Greek island of Samos, in the 6th century BCE\\" during the reign of Polycrates. Scholars disagree whether the dioptra was available that early. An entire book about the construction and surveying usage of the dioptra is credited to Hero of Alexandria (also known as Heron; a brief description of the book is available online; see Lahanas link, below). Hero was \\"one of history’s most ingenious engineers and applied mathematicians.\\" The dioptra was used extensively on aqueduct building projects. Screw turns on several different parts of the instrument made it easy to calibrate for very precise measurements The dioptra was replaced as a surveying instrument by the Theodolite.

Lanier. The 1895 census shows a population of 87 persons along with a post office, express office and a railroad depot. However, the town was abandoned shortly thereafter when dual freezes wiped out the citrus crop in the area. The official plat of the town can be found in Plat Book 1, Page 22 (lower half of the page) of Sumter County and is titled \\"The Infant Town of Florida, Map of Orange Bend.\\" In 1887 Lanier became part of Lake County. Col. Lanier purchased the land from Hubbard Hart, who had purchased it from the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida. The plat consists of 35 lots and also contains the following advertisement: Situated Five miles from Leesburg. Offers Special Inducements of the new extension of the Florida Southern Railway to the Settlers as Follows: Large bodies of the richest drained prairie Land bordering Lake Griffin. Best possible track farming insuring great crops and freedom from drought. The new town and station are situated on healthful high pine land adjoining the great famous hammocks and wild budded orange groves which have made the place a center of wealth and wealthy men. Col. Thomas C. Lanier 1886 The Lake County Historical Society has some additional information about this town. It apparently was the 2nd post office ever established in Lake County. There is also a copy of a speech in their records that claims the town was founded by a relative of Sydney Lanier. However, if Col. Thomas C. Lanier is related to Sydney Lanier, the relationship is not close. In February 2003, most of the platted lots were purchased by Cattle Country, LLC. This company began marketing the land based on the original map of the town. Lake County required aggregating the old lots to comply with the current density rules, so each of the lots marketed by Cattle Country, LLC contain at least two of the original lots of the old plat. Although all of the roads actually built are from the original plat, there were also a number of roads that were no longer needed (because of the aggregation of old lots) which were either vacated or simply not built. This land was also marketed under the name Lanier Glen, but only for marketing purposes. During the redevelopment of this land, fragments of porcelain and glass were the only evidence found from the previous settlement. Col. Thomas C. Lanier's personal groves are shown on the original plat. Although they were not given a lot number, they are just east of the numbered lots. It is unknown if he had a house on this land or not. Today his land can be found at the southwest corner of the intersection of Treasure Island Ave and North Treasure Island Rd, Leesburg, Florida. This land and some additional land on the north side of Treasure Island Ave were platted by Cattle Country, LLC in 2004 as Lanier Groves.

As we change parameters of the objective, the envelope theorem shows that, in a certain sense, changes in the optimizer of the objective do not contribute to the change in the objective function. The envelope theorem is an important tool for comparative statics of optimization models. Statement Let f(x,\\\\alpha) and g_{j}(x,\\\\alpha), j = 1,2, \\\\ldots, m be real-valued continuously differentiable functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+l}, where x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} are choice variables and \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{l} are parameters, and consider the problem of choosing x, for a given \\\\alpha, so as to: : \\\\max_{x} f(x, \\\\alpha) subject to g_{j}(x,\\\\alpha) \\\\geq 0, j = 1,2, \\\\ldots, m and x \\\\geq 0. The Lagrangian expression of this problem is given by :\\\\mathcal{L} (x, \\\\lambda, \\\\alpha) = f(x, \\\\alpha) + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot g(x, \\\\alpha) where \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m} are the Lagrange multipliers. Now let x^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha) and \\\\lambda^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha) together be the solution that maximizes the objective function f subject to the constraints (and hence are saddle points of the Lagrangian), :\\\\mathcal{L}^{\\\\ast} (\\\\alpha) \\\\equiv f(x^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha), \\\\alpha) + \\\\lambda^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha) \\\\cdot g(x^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha), \\\\alpha), and define the value function :V(\\\\alpha) \\\\equiv f(x^{\\\\ast}(\\\\alpha), \\\\alpha). Then we have the following theorem. Theorem: Assume that V and \\\\mathcal{L} are continuously differentiable. Then : \\\\frac{\\\\partial V(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}^{\\\\ast} (\\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L} (x^{\\\\ast} (\\\\alpha), \\\\lambda^{\\\\ast} (\\\\alpha), \\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k}}, k = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, l where \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L} / \\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k} = \\\\partial f / \\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k} + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\partial g / \\\\partial \\\\alpha_{k}. For arbitrary choice sets Let X denote the choice set and let the relevant parameter be t\\\\in \\\\lbrack 0,1]. Letting f:X\\\\times \\\\lbrack 0,1]\\\\rightarrow R denote the parameterized objective function, the value function V and the optimal choice correspondence (set- valued function) X^{\\\\ast } are given by: : V(t) =\\\\sup_{x\\\\in X}f(x,t) (1) : X^{\\\\ast }(t) =\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X:f(x,t)=V(t)\\\\\\\\} (2) \\"Envelope theorems\\" describe sufficient conditions for the value function V to be differentiable in the parameter t and describe its derivative as : V^{\\\\prime }\\\\left( t\\\\right) =f_{t}\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) \\\\text{ for each }x\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right), (3) where f_{t} denotes the partial derivative of f with respect to t. Namely, the derivative of the value function with respect to the parameter equals the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to t holding the maximizer fixed at its optimal level. (The term derives from describing the graph of V as the \\"upper envelope\\" of the graphs of the parameterized family of functions \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f\\\\left( x,\\\\cdot \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{x\\\\in X}.) Traditional envelope theorem derivations use the first-order condition for (1), which requires that the choice set X have the convex and topological structure, and the objective function f be differentiable in the variable x. (The argument is that changes in the maximizer have only a \\"second-order effect\\" at the optimum and so can be ignored.) However, in many applications such as the analysis of incentive constraints in contract theory and game theory, nonconvex production problems, and \\"monotone\\" or \\"robust\\" comparative statics, the choice sets and objective functions generally lack the topological and convexity properties required by the traditional envelope theorems. Paul Milgrom and Segal (2002) observe that the traditional envelope formula holds for optimization problems with arbitrary choice sets at any differentiability point of the value function, provided that the objective function is differentiable in the parameter: Theorem 1: Let t\\\\in \\\\left( 0,1\\\\right) and x\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }\\\\left(t\\\\right) . If both V^{\\\\prime }\\\\left( t\\\\right) and f_{t}\\\\left(x,t\\\\right) exist, the envelope formula (3) holds. Proof: (1) implies that for x\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) , : \\\\max_{s\\\\in \\\\left[ 0,1\\\\right] }\\\\left[ f\\\\left( x,s\\\\right) -V\\\\left( s\\\\right)\\\\right] =f\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) -V\\\\left( t\\\\right) =0. Under the assumptions, the objective function of the displayed maximization problem is differentiable at s=t, and the first-order condition for this maximization is exactly (3). Q.E.D. While differentiability of the value function in general requires strong assumptions, in many applications weaker conditions such as absolute continuity, differentiability almost everywhere, or left- and right- differentiability, suffice. In particular, Milgrom and Segal 's (2002) Theorem 2 offers a sufficient condition for V to be absolutely continuous, which means that it is differentiable almost everywhere and can be represented as an integral of its derivative: Theorem 2: Suppose that f(x,\\\\cdot ) is absolutely continuous for all x\\\\in X. Suppose also that there exists an integrable function b:[0,1] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}_{+} such that f_{t}(x,t)\\\\leq b(t) for all x\\\\in X and almost all t\\\\in \\\\lbrack 0,1]. Then V is absolutely continuous. Suppose, in addition, that f(x,\\\\cdot ) is differentiable for all x\\\\in X, and that X^{\\\\ast }(t) eq \\\\varnothing almost everywhere on [0,1]. Then for any selection x^{\\\\ast }(t)\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }(t), : V(t)=V(0)+\\\\int_{0}^{t}f_{t}(x^{\\\\ast }(s),s)ds. (4) Proof: Using (1), observe that for any t^{\\\\prime},t^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }\\\\in \\\\lbrack 0,1] with t^{\\\\prime }, : V(t^{\\\\prime \\\\prime })-V(t^{\\\\prime }) \\\\leq \\\\sup_{x\\\\in X}f(x,t^{\\\\prime\\\\prime })-f(x,t^{\\\\prime }) =\\\\sup_{x\\\\in X}\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\int_{t^{\\\\prime }}^{t^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }}f_{t}(x,t)dt\\\\right\\\\vert \\\\leq \\\\int_{t^{\\\\prime }}^{t^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }}\\\\sup_{x\\\\in X}f_{t}(x,t)dt\\\\leq \\\\int_{t^{\\\\prime }}^{t^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }}b(t)dt. This implies that V is absolutely continuous. Therefore, V is differentiable almost everywhere, and using (3) yields (4). Q.E.D. This result dispels the common misconception that nice behavior of the value function requires correspondingly nice behavior of the maximizer. Theorem 2 ensures the absolute continuity of the value function even though the maximizer may be discontinuous. In a similar vein, Milgrom and Segal's (2002) Theorem 3 implies that the value function must be differentiable at t=t_{0} and hence satisfy the envelope formula (3) when the family \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f\\\\left( x,\\\\cdot \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} _{x\\\\in X} is equi-differentiable at t_{0}\\\\in \\\\left( 0,1\\\\right) and f_{t}\\\\left(X^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) ,t_{0}\\\\right) is single-valued and continuous at t=t_{0}, even if the maximizer is not differentiable at t_{0} (e.g., if X is described by a set of inequality constraints and the set of binding constraints changes at t_{0}). Applications =Applications to producer theory= Theorem 1 implies Hotelling's lemma at any differentiability point of the profit function, and Theorem 2 implies the producer surplus formula. Formally, let \\\\pi \\\\left( p\\\\right) denote the profit function of a price-taking firm with production set X\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{L} facing prices p\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and let x^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( p\\\\right) denote the firm's supply function, i.e., : \\\\pi (p)=\\\\max_{x\\\\in X}p\\\\cdot x=p\\\\cdot x^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( p\\\\right) \\\\text{.} Let t=p_{i} (the price of good i) and fix the other goods' prices at p_{-i}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L-1}. Applying Theorem 1 to f(x,t)=tx_{i}+p_{-i}\\\\cdot x_{-i} yields \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\pi (p)}{\\\\partial p_{i}}=x_{i}^{\\\\ast }(p) (the firm's optimal supply of good i). Applying Theorem 2 (whose assumptions are verified when p_{i} is restricted to a bounded interval) yields :\\\\pi (t,p_{-i})-\\\\pi (0,p_{-i})=\\\\int_{0}^{p_{i}}x_{i}^{\\\\ast }(s,p_{-i})ds, i.e. the producer surplus \\\\pi (t,p_{-i})-\\\\pi (0,p_{-i}) can be obtained by integrating under the firm's supply curve for good i. =Applications to mechanism design and auction theory= Consider an agent whose utility function f(x,t) over outcomes x\\\\in \\\\bar{X} depends on his type t\\\\in \\\\lbrack 0,1]. Let X\\\\subseteq \\\\bar{X} represent the \\"menu\\" of possible outcomes the agent could obtain in the mechanism by sending different messages. The agent's equilibrium utility V(t) in the mechanism is then given by (1), and the set X^{\\\\ast }(t) of the mechanism's equilibrium outcomes is given by (2). Any selection x^{\\\\ast }(t)\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }(t) is a choice rule implemented by the mechanism. Suppose that the agent's utility function f(x,t) is differentiable and absolutely continuous in t for all x\\\\in Y, and that \\\\sup_{x\\\\in \\\\bar{X}}f_{t}(x,t) is integrable on [0,1]. Then Theorem 2 implies that the agent's equilibrium utility V in any mechanism implementing a given choice rule x^{\\\\ast } must satisfy the integral condition (4). The integral condition (4) is a key step in the analysis of mechanism design problems with continuous type spaces. In particular, in Myerson's (1981) analysis of single-item auctions, the outcome from the viewpoint of one bidder can be described as x=\\\\left( y,z\\\\right) , where y is the bidder's probability of receiving the object and z is his expected payment, and the bidder's expected utility takes the form f\\\\left( \\\\left( y,z\\\\right) ,t\\\\right) =ty-z. In this case, letting \\\\underline{t} denote the bidder's lowest possible type, the integral condition (4) for the bidder's equilibrium expected utility V takes the form : V(t)-V(\\\\underline{t})=\\\\int_{0}^{t}y^{\\\\ast }(s)ds. (This equation can be interpreted as the producer surplus formula for the firm whose production technology for converting numeraire z into probability y of winning the object is defined by the auction and which resells the object at a fixed price t). This condition in turn yields Myerson's (1981) celebrated revenue equivalence theorem: the expected revenue generated in an auction in which bidders have independent private values is fully determined by the bidders' probabilities y^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) of getting the object for all types t as well as by the expected payoffs V(\\\\underline{t}) of the bidders' lowest types. Finally, this condition is a key step in Myerson's (1981) of optimal auctions. For other applications of the envelope theorem to mechanism design see Mirrlees (1971), Holmstrom (1979), Laffont and Maskin (1980), Riley and Samuelson (1981), Fudenberg and Tirole (1991), and Williams (1999). While these authors derived and exploited the envelope theorem by restricting attention to (piecewise) continuously differentiable choice rules or even narrower classes, it may sometimes be optimal to implement a choice rule that is not piecewise continuously differentiable. (One example is the class of trading problems with linear utility described in chapter 6.5 of Myerson (1991).) Note that the integral condition (3) still holds in this setting and implies such important results as Holmstrom's lemma (Holmstrom, 1979), Myerson's lemma (Myerson, 1981), the revenue equivalence theorem (for auctions), the Green–Laffont–Holmstrom theorem (Green and Laffont, 1979; Holmstrom, 1979), the Myerson–Satterthwaite inefficiency theorem (Myerson and Satterthwaite, 1983), the Jehiel–Moldovanu impossibility theorems (Jehiel and Moldovanu, 2001), the McAfee–McMillan weak-cartels theorem (McAfee and McMillan, 1992), and Weber's martingale theorem (Weber, 1983), etc. The details of these applications are provided in Chapter 3 of Milgrom (2004), who offers an elegant and unifying framework in auction and mechanism design analysis mainly based on the envelope theorem and other familiar techniques and concepts in demand theory. =Applications to multidimensional parameter spaces= For a multidimensional parameter space T\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{K}, Theorem 1 can be applied to partial and directional derivatives of the value function. If both the objective function f and the value function V are (totally) differentiable in t, Theorem 1 implies the envelope formula for their gradients: abla V\\\\left( t\\\\right) = abla _{t}f\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) for each x\\\\in X^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) . While total differentiability of the value function may not be easy to ensure, Theorem 2 can be still applied along any smooth path connecting two parameter values t_{0} and t. Namely, suppose that functions f(x,\\\\cdot ) are differentiable for all x\\\\in X with  abla _{t}f(x,t)\\\\leq B for all x\\\\in X, t\\\\in T. A smooth path from t_{0} to t is described by a differentiable mapping \\\\gamma :\\\\left[ 0,1\\\\right] \\\\rightarrow T with a bounded derivative, such that \\\\gamma \\\\left( 0\\\\right) =t_{0} and \\\\gamma \\\\left( 1\\\\right) =t. Theorem 2 implies that for any such smooth path, the change of the value function can be expressed as the path integral of the partial gradient abla _{t}f(x^{\\\\ast }(t),t) of the objective function along the path: : V(t)-V(t_{0})=\\\\int_{\\\\gamma } abla _{t}f(x^{\\\\ast }(s),s)\\\\cdot ds. In particular, for t=t_{0}, this establishes that cyclic path integrals along any smooth path \\\\gamma must be zero: :\\\\int abla _{t}f(x^{\\\\ast }(s),s)\\\\cdot ds=0. This \\"integrability condition\\" plays an important role in mechanism design with multidimensional types, constraining what kind of choice rules x^{\\\\ast } can be sustained by mechanism-induced menus X\\\\subseteq \\\\bar{X}. In application to producer theory, with x\\\\in X\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{L} being the firm's production vector and t\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L} being the price vector, f\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) =t\\\\cdot x, and the integrability condition says that any rationalizable supply function x^{\\\\ast } must satisfy : \\\\int x^{\\\\ast }(s)\\\\cdot ds=0. When x^{\\\\ast } is continuously differentiable, this integrability condition is equivalent to the symmetry of the substitution matrix \\\\left(\\\\partial x_{i}^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) /\\\\partial t_{j}\\\\right) _{i,j=1}^{L}. (In consumer theory, the same argument applied to the expenditure minimization problem yields symmetry of the Slutsky matrix.) =Applications to parameterized constraints= Suppose now that the feasible set X\\\\left( t\\\\right) depends on the parameter, i.e., : V(t) =\\\\sup_{x\\\\in X\\\\left( t\\\\right) }f(x,t) : X^{\\\\ast }(t) =\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X\\\\left( t\\\\right) :f(x,t)=V(t)\\\\\\\\}\\\\text{, } where X\\\\left( t\\\\right) =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x\\\\in X:g\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) \\\\geq 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for some g:X\\\\times \\\\left[ 0,1\\\\right] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{K}. Suppose that X is a convex set, f and g are concave in x, and there exists \\\\hat{x}\\\\in X such that g\\\\left( \\\\hat{x},t\\\\right) >0 for all t\\\\in \\\\left[ 0,1\\\\right] . Under these assumptions, it is well known that the above constrained optimization program can be represented as a saddle-point problem for the Lagrangian L\\\\left( x,\\\\lambda,t\\\\right) =f(x,t)+\\\\lambda\\\\cdot g\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) , where \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{K} is the vector of Lagrange multipliers chosen by the adversary to minimize the Lagrangian. This allows the application of Milgrom and Segal's (2002, Theorem 4) envelope theorem for saddle-point problems, under the additional assumptions that X is a compact set in a normed linear space, f and g are continuous in x, and f_{t} and g_{t} are continuous in \\\\left( x,t\\\\right) . In particular, letting \\\\left( x^{\\\\ast}(t),\\\\lambda^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) \\\\right) denote the Lagrangian's saddle point for parameter value t, the theorem implies that V is absolutely continuous and satisfies : V(t)=V(0)+\\\\int_{0}^{t}L_{t}(x^{\\\\ast }(s),\\\\lambda^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( s\\\\right) ,s)ds. For the special case in which f\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) is independent of t, K=1, and g\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) =h\\\\left( x\\\\right) +t, the formula implies that V^{\\\\prime }(t)=L_{t}(x^{\\\\ast }(t),\\\\lambda^{\\\\ast }\\\\left( t\\\\right) ,t)=\\\\lambda^{\\\\ast}\\\\left( t\\\\right) for a.e. t. That is, the Lagrange multiplier \\\\lambda^{\\\\ast}\\\\left( t\\\\right) on the constraint is its \\"shadow price\\" in the optimization program. =Other applications= Milgrom and Segal (2002) demonstrate that the generalized version of the envelope theorems can also be applied to convex programming, continuous optimization problems, saddle-point problems, and optimal stopping problems.

Bell was born in Merthyr Tydfil and became a high-profile trade unionist, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. He was elected for Derby, a two-member constituency, alongside a Liberal in the 1900 general election. He sympathised with the Liberals on most issues, except those that directly affected his union. This meant that he was not very compatible with the other Labour MP, Keir Hardie, a committed socialist member of the Independent Labour Party. Although its chairman in 1902–03, by 1903 Bell was struggling to adhere to the rules of the LRC group in Parliament, which now had five members following a series of by-elections. By 1904 he was considered to have lapsed from the group and was associated with the Liberal Party.David Martin, \\"Ideology and Composition\\", in The First Labour Party 1906-1914, ed. K.D. Brown (London: Croom Helm Ltd, 1985), 17 He was re-elected at the 1906 general election. His supporters in the Derby Trades Council became disillusioned with Bell and replaced him at the January 1910 general election with another trade unionist from the ASRS, Jimmy Thomas. After leaving Parliament, Bell joined the Employment Exchange branch of the Board of Trade. He retired from that in 1920 but continued in local politics and served as a member of the Southgate Urban District Council 1922–29.  Industrial interests  In 1903, Bell joined William John Parry in forming North Wales Quarries Ltd. which owned three slate quarries in Bethesda, Gwynedd. These were intended to be run co-operatively with the workers, most of whom were on strike against the owners of the nearby Penrhyn Quarry. The three-year strike against Penrhyn was the longest industrial dispute in British history, and brought great hardship to the 2,000 quarrymen who were locked out. The operation of Pandreiniog, Moel Faban and Tanybwlch quarries failed to provide a lasting model of co-operation, but they did keep many skilled quarrymen from emigrating to the United States.

The contract refers to an agreement reached by the Polish United Workers' Party and the Solidarity (Solidarność in Polish) movement during the Polish Round Table Agreement. The final agreement was signed on April 5, 1989. As a result, real political power was vested in a newly created bicameral legislature and in a president who would be the chief executive. Solidarność became a legitimate and legal political party. Perhaps the most important decision reached during the talks was to allow for partially free elections to be held in Poland. All seats to the newly created Senate of Poland were to be elected democratically, as were 161 seats (35 percent of the total) in Sejm. The remaining 65% of the seats were reserved for the Communist Party and its satellite parties. In addition, all 35 seats elected via the country-wide list were reserved for the Party's candidates provided they gained a certain quota of support. This was to ensure that the most notable leaders of the Party were elected. The outcome of the election was largely unpredictable. After all, Poland had not had a truly fair election since the 1920s, so there was little precedent to go by. It was clear that the Communists were unpopular, but there were no hard numbers as to how low support for them would actually fall. The Communist government still had control over most major media outlets and employed sports and television celebrities for candidates, as well as successful local personalities and businesspeople. Some members of the opposition were worried that such tactics would gain enough votes from the less educated segment of the population to give the Communists the legitimacy that they craved. The election of June 4, 1989 (and the second round of June 18) brought a landslide victory to Solidarność: 99% of all the seats in the Senate and all of the possible seats in the Sejm. Out of 100 seats in the Senate, 99 were won by Solidarity and 1 by an independent candidate. Out of 35 seats of the country-wide list, only one was gained by the Party candidate (Adam Zieliński) and one by a United People's Party satellite party candidate, while the remainder were taken by the Solidarity in the second run. Altogether, out of 161 seats eligible, Solidarity took 160. The turnout was surprisingly low: only 62.7% in the first round and 25% in the second. The outcome was a major surprise to both the Party and Solidarity. Only a few days before June 4 the party Central Committee was discussing the possible reaction of the Western world should Solidarity not win a single seat. At the same time the Solidarity leaders were trying to prepare some set of rules for the non-party MPs in a Communist- dominated parliament, as it was expected that the Solidarity would win not more than 20 seats. Although the elections were not entirely democratic, they paved the way for creation of Tadeusz Mazowiecki's cabinet and a peaceful transition to democracy, which was confirmed after the Polish parliamentary elections of 1991.

M. and three hundred is a short (14 pages), anonymous English Christian text, probably written in the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century and first printed in about 1531. It consists of a prose tract, in the form of a polemical prayer, expressing Lollard sentiments and arguing for religious reform. In it, the simple ploughman/narrator speaks on behalf of \\"the repressed common man imbued with the simple truths of the Bible and a knowledge of the commandments against the mighty and monolithic conservative church\\".Douglas H. Parker (ed): Praier & Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe, University of Toronto Press, 1997. . The pastoral- ecclesiastical metaphor of shepherds and sheep is used extensively as a number of criticisms are made about such things as confession, indulgences, purgatory, tithing and celibacy. The Prayer became important in the sixteenth century, when its themes were taken up by proponents of the Protestant Reformation. History of the Prayer The Prayer was probably written as a manuscript in the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century, but no manuscript copies survive. It was first printed by a Protestant printer, Martinus de Keyser, in Antwerp, in about 1531, and then in London, by another Protestant printer, Thomas Godfray, in about 1532, although Godfray's name does not appear in the edition. A preface in both editions, \\"To the Reader\\", dates itself 28 February 1531 and claims (undoubtedly in error) that the Prayer was written \\"not longe after the yere of our Lorde A thousand and thre hundred.\\" John Bale included the Prayer, under the curious Latin title of Agricolae Praecatione in his bibliographic work, Scriptorum Illustrium maioris Brytannie . . . Catalogus (Basel, 1557–59). John Foxe included the text of the Prayer (identifying Tyndale as its editor) in his second (1570) edition of Acts and Monuments, but it was deleted in the third (1576) edition, and reinstated in the fourth (1583) and subsequent editions. Foxe's 1570 introduction dates the Prayer to the mid-fourteenth century and claims not to have changed any of it since the antique language gives \\"credit\\" to it and its \\"testimony.\\" Marginal notes explicate the most difficult words as well as the points that square with Protestant attacks on Roman Catholicism. An edition was edited and reprinted by the University of Toronto Press in 1997. Author of the Prayer In 1662, Thomas Fuller attributed the Prayer to \\"Robert Langland,\\" then supposed by Robert Crowley and Bale to be the author of Piers Plowman, a poem whose author is now usually identified as William Langland). Fuller was familiar with Piers Plowman and with several separate editions of the Prayer, which he believed were printed by Tyndale and Foxe. The preface to the published edition is signed \\"W.T.\\". Parker and others take this to mean that William Tyndale wrote it; Anthea Hume disagrees and suggests George Joye as the writer.Anthea Hume: Edmund Spenser: Protestant Poet. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984. Godfrey may indeed have printed the Prayer by or with the approval of Tyndale (as John Foxe indicates) ca.1532-6 in London or in 1531 in Antwerp. Tyndale could have been involved with the first edition, since he is known to have been in Antwerp that year, and Godfrey had printing connections with Tyndale and Antwerp. Controversial content The Prayer was highly controversial, owing to its questioning of some of the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church. Thomas More (1478-1535) was probably referring to the Prayer, when he attacked the \\"Ploughmans Prayour\\" in his preface to his Confutation of Tyndale's Answer (published in 1532 by More's nephew, William Rastell). In 1546, the Prayer was among the books banned by name in England, according to Robert Steele, along with all the works of John Frith, William Tyndale, John Wycliffe, John Bale, Robert Barnes, Miles Coverdale, and others.Robert Steele: \\"Notes on English Books Printed Abroad, 1525-1548\\", Transactions of the Bibliographic Society 11 (1911): 189-236. The preface to the printed version (by \\"W.T\\") underlines some of the controversial content, for example comparing the Protestant reformers to Christ. Both were attacked as \\"innovators\\" when, according to the preface, they were only teaching the true and ancient doctrines. In this way, the Prayer is mustered up as an old proto-Protestant English text showing the truth and putatively traditional basis of Protestant teachings. The text of the Prayer echoes other reformist texts, such as Rede Me and Be Nott Wrothe. W.T., in his preface, also argues that those in positions of wealth and power are corrupted by self-interest, and only the poor commons can see the truth of scripture. Some of these criticisms are directed toward the king and other rulers; W.T. does explicitly denounce the murder of Archbishop John Fisher, whom the king had executed 1535 for refusing the Oath of Supremacy.

The picture is made from rocks including Ashford Black Marble and Blue John. The village is overlooked by Ecton Hill, which has probably been mined for copper and lead since the sixteenth century. It was leased by the owner the Duke of Devonshire until, in 1760, the fourth duke decided to work it on his own account. Within fifty years, it became the richest individual copper mine in England producing over sixty thousands tons of ore. Until 1769, when the fifth Duke, William Cavendish, opened his own works at nearby Whiston in the Churnet Valley, the ore was carried to Denby by packhorse for smelting. Much of the copper was used for making brass, but over three hundred tons was supplied to the Navy to protect the hulls of its ships against boring worms, after being rolled at the works of Thomas Evans in Derby. By 1790 the mine was employing 400 workers, men, women and children, producing 4000 tons a year. By 1800 the ore had almost been worked out and the Duke relinquished his interest, the mine finally closing in 1891. The Duke's profits had been almost a third of a million pounds and enabled him, so it is said, to build The Crescent at Buxton. Lead was smelted on the spot and sent initially to Derby by packhorse, but later by the Cromford Canal en route for the lead market at Hull.Cooper, B., (1983) Transformation of a Valley: The Derbyshire Derwent, Heinemann, republished 1991 Cromford: Scarthin Books Arthur Ratcliffe MP built a house, modelled on a mediaeval castle, complete with battlements, next to the former lead mine in 1932. Railway station Site of the station in 1993 Ecton was served by a railway station which was opened by the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway on 27 June 1904 whilst being entirely operated by the North Staffordshire Railway. The line was closed in 1934 and since the 1937 the route of the line has been a foot and cycle path, the Manifold Way. Ecton Creamery The Express Dairies creamery at Ecton created most of the freight traffic on the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway line, with most of its product destined via dedicated milk trains for London. In 1911 were brought in from the L&MVLR; growing to in 1922. Initially all the milk was carried in milk churns, which had to be manhandled across the railway platforms at Waterhouses. After the First World War the churns were loaded into standard-gauge vans taken to and from Ecton on the transporter wagons. Eventually milk tankers were also used, again being transferred between Ecton and Waterhouses on the transporters. The importance of the milk traffic was such that between 1919 and 1926, a special milk trains ran direct between Waterhouses and London, rather than the vans being shunted between various trains until the milk reached its ultimate destination. In 1932 Express Dairies closed its Ecton creamery, concentrating on its new Rowsley creamery, re-routing milk collection in the area to road transport.

Location  Paris is located in northern central France. By road, it is southeast of London, south of Calais, southwest of Brussels, north of Marseille, northeast of Nantes, and southeast of Rouen.Google Maps, Retrieved 6 July 2013 Paris is located in the north-bending arc of the river Seine and includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.  Area  Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about in area, enclosed by the ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique. The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of , the city limits were expanded marginally to in the 1920s.

Climate  225x225px Paris has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb ) which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet. Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between , and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above . Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded for weeks, reached on some days and seldom cooled down at night. Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, nights cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around . Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature will dip below for only a few days a year. Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground. The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation. Paris has an average annual precipitation of , and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However the city is known for intermittent abrupt heavy showers. Paris has a rich history of meteorological observations, with some going back as far as 1665. The highest recorded temperature is on 25 July 2019, and the lowest is on 10 December 1879.

It was leveled in the 18th century. * Belleville: ASL\\"Paris Facts\\" at Paris-walking-tours.com. * Menilmontant: ASL * Buttes-Chaumont: ASL * Passy: ASL * Chaillot: ASL * Montagne Sainte-Geneviève: ASL * Butte-aux-Cailles: ASL * Montparnasse: ASL The highest elevation in the City of Paris is not, as often thought, on the hill of Montmartre, where the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur is located, but on the hill of Belleville on the , which reaches . In the greater urban area, the highest point is in the Forest of Montmorency (Val-d'Oise département), north- northwest of the center of Paris as the crow flies, at above sea level. The lowest elevation is , indicated on the river Seine at the western city limits. Paris lies in the so-called \\"Paris Basin,\\" a low-lying continental shelf region that is occasionally submerged by ocean waters over geologic time, which leaves marine sedimentary deposits behind (e.g., limestone, which was used to construct many of the buildings of the city; this was excavated from an underground quarry called the \\"Quarries of Paris\\"). When the region is above sea-level, as at the present time, rivers draining water from the land form, and these cut channels into the landscape. The rivers therefore strongly influence the topography of Paris. The Seine river cuts through Paris, but has apparently meandered in the past within a larger valley whose edges lie on the outskirts of the metropolitan area (the edges of this larger valley are visible from tall buildings in Paris). Many of the \\"hills\\" in Paris, appear to be formed as the result of cutoffs from previous meanders in the Seine river, which is now largely channelized to maintain its stability.  Divisions  = Arrondissements of Paris = The city of Paris is divided into twenty arrondissements municipaux, administrative districts, more simply referred to as arrondissements. These are not to be confused with departmental arrondissements, which subdivide the 101 French départements. The word \\"arrondissement\\", when applied to Paris, refers almost always to the municipal arrondissements. The number of the arrondissement is indicated by the last two digits in most Parisian postal codes (75001 up to 75020).

Biography Blackwood was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He studied piano there and was doing solo appearances at the age of 14 with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. After studies at many places (including Yale University, where he earned his Master of Arts degree) in the United States, he went to Paris to study from 1954 to 1956. His teachers include Olivier Messiaen, Paul Hindemith, and Nadia Boulanger. For forty years, from 1958 to 1997, Blackwood taught at the University of Chicago, most of the time with the title of Professor. He then became Professor Emeritus at the University. Blackwood's initial compositions were not particularly unconventional although in them he employed polyrhythm and wide melodic contours. This early music by Blackwood has been characterized as in an atonal yet a formally conservative style. In 1980–81 Blackwood shifted rather abruptly to a new style, releasing Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media. For these pieces, he used microtonality to create unusual equal tempered musical scales. Blackwood has explored all equal temperaments from 13 through 24, including 15-ET and 19-ET.Blackwood, Easley and Kust, Jeffrey (1996/2005). Easley Blackwood: Microtonal Compositions. Cedille.

As a performer at the piano, Blackwood has played diverse compositions and has promoted the music of Charles Ives, Pierre Boulez, and the Second Viennese School. In addition to his solo piano performances, Blackwood is pianist in the chamber group Chicago Pro Musica, largely comprising members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Some in length, it runs from Hulme End in the north to Waterhouses in the south, mostly through the Manifold Valley and the valley of its only tributary, the River Hamps, following the route of the former Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway, a gauge line which closed in 1934 after a short life. The Manifold Way was opened in July 1937 by Staffordshire County Council after the LMS handed over the trackbed to them. Tarmacked throughout, and with only a slight downhill gradient from north to south, the path is also ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. For about , near Wetton Mill, the original route along the former railway is shared with motor traffic where what is now a minor unclassified road has been diverted along its route. This section includes Swainsley tunnel. However, the signed Manifold Trail is routed along the eastern bank of the river and largely avoids the on-road route. Unlike other nearby walk- and cycleways, such as the Tissington Trail and the High Peak Trail, which cross elevated areas of the Peak District, the Manifold Way follows the valley bottoms and is altogether more sheltered. The path passes through attractive scenery, and indeed tourism was one of the reasons for the original construction of the line. Popular locations along the route include Thor's Cave, the mill at Wetton Hill and Beeston Tor. A little to the east lies Dovedale, a better-known beauty spot. The Manifold Way does not pass through any significant centres of population; indeed it was once described by a railway worker as a line that started in the middle of nowhere, and ended up in the same place. Whilst the railway did serve villages and hamlets along its route, these were mostly located about a mile above the valley, a fact which contributed to the railway's ultimate demise. Whilst walking along the Manifold Way the rivers Manifold and Hamps are never far away - in fact there are dozens of small bridges crossing them. However, over the summer months the River Manifold disappears down a swallet or sink hole near Wetton Mill, to reappear some distance way, at Ilam. In all there were ten stations and halts along the line. Most had some sort of waiting room, and also a siding, but were only small affairs. The sites of the halts can be seen today, and there is also some evidence of the loading platforms, especially at Ecton, where the dairy provided much business for the railway. The valley-bottom nature of the Manifold Way offers much to see in the way of flora and fauna, and animal wildlife. Apart from the official Manifold Way route itself, the area also lends itself to many circular walking routes which utilize the route. The Manifold Way passes through some areas which comprise the South Peak Estate, land holdings owned by the National Trust. At Hulme End, the old station building has been restored as a visitor centre, and the cafe/shop at Wetton Mill is a popular spot. At Ecton Hill lie the remains of a 4,000-year-old copper mine, and the caves at Beeston Tor have revealed Neolithic and Bronze Age remains. The trackway is well maintained and there are a number of car parks and refreshment facilities (some mobile) situated at convenient intervals along its length. There are campsites at Hulme End and Wetton Village, and bikes can be hired at Waterhouses, at the southern end of the trail.A typical view - looking south along the route today, near Wetton. Another typical view - looking north from the same viewpoint.

Eugenio Chiaradia and Guglielmo Siniscalco played in early years; Dano De Falco, Arturo Franco, and Vito Pittalà in late years. The spiritual father, long-time coach, and non-playing captain through 1966 was Carl'Alberto Perroux. History In 1951 Italy won its first European championship (Open teams) and lost to the United States for the second Bermuda Bowl, on home ground in Naples.

Select \\"Venue\\" city name, then \\"Open series\\" team name, to see a list of team members. Soon afterward Captain Perroux undertook long-term preparations to win those events, the only major international championships at the time. United States teams were considered the best in the world after the war, and they won two more Bermuda Bowls for North America against Europe. Great Britain, France, and Sweden were also strong, and Europe won the fifth and sixth tournaments with six-man teams from Great Britain and France before Italy won again at the European level. The breakthrough came in 1956, when the Blue Team defeated Bermuda Bowl champion France in Stockholm earning the right to contest the 1957 Bermuda Bowl in New York City where they went on to defeat a United States team on its home ground. The players were now Walter Avarelli, Giorgio Belladonna, Eugenio Chiaradia, Massimo d'Alelio, Pietro Forquet, and Guglielmo Siniscalco. With remarkably stable personnel, the reign of the Blue Team continued, winning twelve world team championships in the thirteen years between 1957 and 1969, broken only by a sixth-place finish in the inaugural 1960 World Team Olympiad in Turin. The Blue Team retired after 1969 but key members returned to win four more world titles in the four years from 1972 to 1975. A large part of the Blue Team's success lay in new and inventive bidding systems, which were often deemed quite strange, especially by conservative US circles. Losing teams sometimes even complained that the Italians had an unfair advantage using bids that were partly incomprehensible to Americans. Belladonna of Rome and his partners played Roman Club, a \\"short club\\" system. Neapolitans Chiaradia and Forquet played Neapolitan Club, a strong club system attributed to Professor Chiaradia and developed with Forquet.The online magazine neapolitan club (Italian language with English versions of many pages) sketches the system on its homepage, center column, and may provide much more system information. There is one interview about features of the historic system, by Laura Camponeschi (consultancy by Paolo Enrico Garrisi) with Agustin Madala of Argentina and Italy, \\"Agus on Neapolitan Club\\" (2010-11-29). Camponeschi or Garrisi call it \\"Chiaradia's system\\" and make this claim about one feature discussed: :\\"The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge attributes this convention to the Blue Team Club of Forquet–Garozzo. It's a mistake. The convention is of Eugenio Chiaradia, who developed it with Pietro Forquet from an own preceding idea, the 'Neapolitan 4', and who anyway published it before the Blue Team Club.\\" Both systems featured canapé-style openings, and often light opening bids and interventions. When young, inventive and cocky Garozzo joined the team in 1960, he further developed with Forquet the Neapolitan system into the Blue Club, which gained worldwide popularity in later years. Denouement. The string of Blue Team wins lasted until 1969, when the members announced their retirement. The American Dallas Aces team finally regained world titles for the US in the 1970 and 1971 Bermuda Bowls, when the Blue Team was absent. The Blue Team re-formed and captured the 1972 Olympiad and the 1973 and 1974 Bermuda Bowls, each time defeating the Americans. The original Aces disbanded in 1974, and the Italians again beat the USA team in 1975. In 1976, the Bermuda Bowl was won by the US and the Olympiad by Brazil, marking the end of Italy's dominance in the Open category. Toward the end of their string of victories the Italians changed their lineup; Forquet, Pabis Ticci and D'Alelio withdrew, while Garozzo and Belladonna paired off, playing a version of Precision Club modified by Garozzo and called \\"Super Precision\\". The team was no longer officially called \\"Blue Team\\", but it still won. Cheating and Controversies The string of Blue Team victories was also followed by some cheating allegations. Originally the evidence only surfaced against \\"lesser\\" team members only, but in Avon Wilsmore's 2018 book the evidence was shown against the whole of the blue team, based on historical game records and bids. An unusual lead. One of those featured a deal from the 1968 Bermuda Bowl in which Camillo Pabis Ticci led the ace of clubs against a four spades contract, holding . With a singleton in partner's hand the defense won two aces and two club ruffs. According to a review by John Swanson,Ron Garber, Review of Inside the Bermuda Bowl by John Swanson. Published in Southern California Bridge News, June 1998. Reprint by John Swanson retrieved 2010-03-31. which gives the opponent's bidding as 1 [South], 2, 2, 3, 4 and concludes that Pabis Ticci's explanation of the unusual lead was \\"patently absurd\\". However, in earlier review by Victor Mollo and Aksel J. Nielsen,Defence at Bridge (1976), Question #2 where the bidding is given as, 1 [North], 1, 2, 3, 4, they conclude \\"On the bidding, D'Alelio [the partner of Pabis Ticci] was hardly likely to have the A or a quick entry in trumps. The best chance to best the contract was, therefore, to find him with a singleton in one of the minors, and give him a ruff. Which minor? North's 2 bid pointed the way.\\" However, the contemporary Sports Illustrated article (1968) collides with the bidding given by Mollo and Nielsen: \\"As North-South had not bid clubs, it did not seem likely that the defense would hit on the killing club ruff.\\"\\"A Familiar Finish For The Blues From Italy\\", Sports Illustrated, July 1, 1968 Later sources\\"Is GIB Cheating?\\". wordpress.com. note that Pabis Ticci had no reason to tell Swanson why he made the lead, and presumed the recorded: \\"Arthur Robinson had led the A to defeat a partscore in an earlier session and he thought it would be nice to ‘hoist him by his own petard’\\" given by Swanson, failed to discern this was in jest. This source also notes the discrepancy between listed bidding auctions, but fails to resolve it. The \\"foot-tapping\\" scandal. The best-known controversy occurred in 1975, when the Bermuda Bowl was held at its home site of Bermuda.It is described in detail in Bob Hamman's autobiography At the Table Journalist Bruce Keidan reported that partners Gianfranco Facchini and Sergio Zucchelli were touching each other's shoes under the table in an apparent attempt to relay information about their hands. Cheating is of course illegal and normally grounds for expulsion from any bridge organization. Keidan's observations, which were confirmed by several witnesses, were presented to the presiding authorities of the event, who \\"severely reprimanded\\" Facchini and Zucchelli for their activity but allowed the players to continue competing in the event. Although the Italians were allowed to stay, the Bermuda Bowl authorities placed blocks underneath the tables to prevent any further foot contact.\\"Bermuda Incident\\". Bridgebum.com.John Swanson, The Italian Foot Soldiers. An anonymous accusation. Another incident occurred during the 1963 tournament.ACBL Hall of Fame: John Gerber An anonymous letter written in Italian was delivered to the American coach John Gerber. He secured a translator to read it aloud, but asked the translator to stop after the first paragraph, to deliver the letter to Italian captain Carl'Alberto Perroux, and to explain that Gerber had heard only the first paragraph. The writer had accused the Blue Team of cheating. After reading the letter to his team, Perroux suggested that the match be played with screens running across the tables (12 years before modern screens were introduced), but Gerber would have none of it. The goodwill engendered by this exchange inspired Perroux and his team to present their championship trophies to Gerber and the American team in what was described as the greatest act of sportsmanship in bridge history. Avon Wilsmore book. In 2018, former Australian champion Avon Wilsmore published the book Under the Table: The Case Against the Blue Team in which he documented several hands from the various World Championships and Olympiads in which he regarded the Blue Team's bidding as suspicious. In particular he noted many deviations from their announced bidding system, liberal use of \\"off shape\\" takeout doubles and suspiciously high rate of killing opening leads.

This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as \\"Dialogue between gentleman & plowman.\\" While clearly in the Piers Plowman Tradition, Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century Lollard anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. The English Works of Wyclif.) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. The dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in purgatory and indulgences is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 \\"Reformation Parliament\\"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to Simon Fish's A Supplicacyon for the Beggers and Thomas More's rebuttal and defense of purgatory in The Supplycacyon of Soulys (1529). King John, Sir John Oldcastle, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of William Tyndale's New Testament in 1526 and Henry V's persecution of Lollards. To defend Lutherans and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of \\"newfangledness,\\" the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices.

The work contains a possible allusion to 1 Corinthians 9:10: \\"...when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing the harvest.\\" This verse is used by St Paul in an argument that the Apostles' (\\"we [who] have sown spiritual seed among you\\"1 Corinthians 9:11) food and other basic needs should be supplied by the laity of the early Christian church.

Synopsis Valérian and Laureline are departing the Earth colony Technorog following a tour of inspection. Passing through the protective shield that surrounds the planet, Laureline is suddenly enveloped in a blue flame and rendered cataleptic. Recovering she reveals that she could hear what sounded like a cry for help. Checking their tracking instruments, they find an alien spacecraft falling towards Technorog. It strikes the protective shield and bounces into the asteroid belt that rings the planet. Valérian and Laureline spacewalk to the alien ship which they find deserted. Suddenly, Laureline is again rendered cataleptic and this time floats out of the spacecraft and into the asteroids. Following, Valérian finds Laureline surrounded by a group of strange aliens. The lead alien, unable to bring Laureline round, moves to open her spacesuit. Valérian intervenes. The lead alien introduces himself, using telepathy, as Argol, He-Who-Has-The-Gift-Of-Speaking-In-Minds. His family's maternal ancestor, Garol, She-Who-Has-The-Gift-Of-Taking-Over-Minds, has fallen gravely ill. In an attempt to get help she has taken over Laureline's mind but is now too sick to free her. Argol's wife, Orgal, She-Who-Has-The-Gift-Of-Making- Things-Move-Through-Space, used her telekinetic powers to bring Laureline to them. Valérian offers to bring them back to his astroship to see if he can cure Garol's illness. On the way, Argol introduces the rest of his family: his son Lagor and daughter Logar, who haven't yet discovered their gifts, and the Goumon, their pet. He explains that they come from the planet below them which is called Alflolol and that they have been away exploring other worlds. Valérian tells him that the planet below him is called Technorog and belongs to Earth. Argol laughs and says his people have just been away on a little trip. Valérian estimates their \\"little trip\\" has lasted 4,000 years. Algol explains that his people live for hundreds of thousands of years. Reaching the astroship, Valérian takes them to its medical unit where he manages to stabilise Garol's condition. Laureline recovers, much to the delight of the Goumon which has taken a shine to her. Valérian contacts the Governor of Technorog requesting permission to return to the planet. As the astroship flies over the surface of their planet, the Alflololians are dumbfounded by the activities of human settlers – the salt extraction plants on the ocean, the mines, the factories and the hydroponic plantations. They are even more dismayed when they discover that the humans have built their capital, Technorogville, on top of where they had their campsite. Landing, the guards that greet them demand that the Alflololians are put through sanitary control. Laureline goes with them while Valérian goes to the Governor's office. He explains to the Governor that Technorog's original inhabitants have returned and that, under Galaxity's laws, they have the right to return to the land that is theirs. The Governor wants to refer the matter to Technorog's council before making a decision. Suddenly, the door opens and Laureline arrives with the Alflololians. At the same time, alarms start going off all around the city – chaos has broken out as the automatic control systems have broken down. Laureline admits that the Alflololians had been having a bit of fun before they came to the Governor's office which they have come to claim as their own since it lies on the exact spot they lived on before they departed. Left with no choice, the Governor leaves them to it and Algol and his family begin celebrating their return. The party lasts for several days and, eventually, Valérian and Laureline, exhausted, fall asleep in the corridor outside. Waking up, the pair find the Alflololians have gone. Algol has left a message – the city doesn't agree with them and they have set out for their traditional hunting grounds. The Governor arrives with the rest of the council. He orders Valérian and Laureline to lead an expedition to bring them back – at least, up to now, they knew where the Alflololians were and what they were doing. Now, they present a threat to industrial production. The Governor provides the best men and equipment but they prove no match for the harsh environment and soon, their equipment destroyed, the last of the able-bodied men are forced to turn back leaving Valérian and Laureline alone in the jungle. Making camp, they soon fall asleep but, suddenly, Laureline is grabbed by a huge tentacled beast and borne away into the jungle. Valérian gives chase and follows them out of the jungle to the shores of Magnet Ocean. Left with no choice, Valérian draws his gun and prepares to fire, hoping he won't hit Laureline. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, the Goumon appears and attacks the creature. Valérian drags Laureline out of the water as Argol and the rest of the family arrive but she has fallen sick – the creature is a Shalafut-Personality-Splitter. Suddenly, Logar stands over Laureline and cures her. Algol is delighted – his daughter has found her gift – he tells her she will henceforth be known as Logar, She- Who-Saves-From-Nasty-Beasts. He invites Valérian and Laureline to accompany them on their boat where his son, Lagor, will be taught how to kill his first Furutz, one of the vicious sea creatures that inhabits the ocean. On the boat, on the hunt, they close in on a herd of Furutz swimming near the salt extraction plants when suddenly a squadron of aircraft fly over them. Valérian's radio crackles into life and the Governor's voice orders them to withdraw from the area as it is restricted. Algol warns them to get clear – a panicked herd of Furutz can cause untold damage. The Governor ignores them and opens fire. The Furutz are enraged and attack the salt extraction plants causing spectacular damage. Somehow, in the middle of the devastation, Lagor manages to make the kill and the Alflololians drag the huge beast onto the shore. The Governor and his men land. The situation has gotten worse – a hundred Alflololian families have now arrived and are demanding to be allowed to return to their home. Laureline is horrified to discover that the Governor plans to put them on a reservation. Valérian is left in charge of administering the new arrangement. The reservation is on the edge of the desert near some factories on the worst hunting grounds on the planet. There is little game and all the food is contaminated by the pollution from the factories. Hunting becomes impossible when the sirocco winds blow from the desert. With the Alflololians on the brink of starvation, Valérian convinces the council to give them food-aid. But there is a price – the Alflololians must work for their food. This is the last straw for Laureline who leaves Valérian and, throwing her lot in with the Alflololians, heads off to the hydroponic plantations with them. Fed up, Valérian sets up camp in the desert. Some days later, he receives an urgent call from the Governor – a catastrophe has occurred at the hydroponic plantations. Arriving there, he discovers that all the foodstuffs have been transformed into pretty flowers. Algol informs him that his son has discovered his gift and will now be known as Lagor, He- Who-Has-The-Gift-Of-Making-Ugly-Things-Beautiful. Unfortunately, the flowers are not edible and the planet is now on the brink of starvation. The Governor has a new plan: the Alflololians will be split up – some to the mines, some to the factories, some to the power plants. Valérian refuses to comply with his new orders. The Governor threatens to inform Galaxity about Laureline's rebellious behaviour – if Valérian doesn't co-operate, Laureline will be dismissed from the Spatio-Temporal Service and will finish her days in the mines. Reluctantly, Valérian complies. Several days later, Valérian begins a tour of inspection to see how the Alflololians are getting on. Arriving at a factory, he discovers that the spaceships they have been making have all been transformed into colourful sculptures. The situation is similar in the other factories – the atomic weapons factory can only make pocket-knives while at the biology centre, everyone has hay-fever. Moving on to the mines, he discovers that the drilling rigs are paralysed. Flying over the power plants he finds a huge fire raging. Reaching Technorogville, he finds it plunged in darkness due to a system-wide power cut. Entering the Governor's office, the council are in a state of despair – production has ground to a complete halt. Finally they agree that the Alflololians should be allowed to roam free on their own world. Heading to the reservation to pass on the good news, Valérian is surprised to discover the Alflololians leaving in their spaceships. The only ones left are Algol and his family, who cannot leave because their ship is too badly damaged. Laureline is with them – she explains that the Alflololians had had enough and have chosen to return to travelling. Valérian offers Algol a lift in his astroship and Laureline finally makes up with him. Leading the flotilla of Alflololian ships through the protective shield, they say their farewells to the Governor who warns them never to come back. The Alflololian ships go their separate ways. Valérian takes Algol and his family to Galaxity, promising them there will be plenty to eat and drink and their celebrations will be appreciated. The high-ranking officials of Galaxity await them as ambassadors and prepare a reception for them.

Alflolol is a yellow/orange planet surrounded by a rocky asteroid belt. The planet has at least one ocean and a desert from which fierce sirocco winds blow across the surface. It rotates on its axis once every 60 Earth days. It has a single moon that rotates every 30 days. The native Alflololians are few in number due to spontaneous birth control practices and are arranged in familial groups. Their life spans are very long compared with humans – approximately 25,000 Earth years. Each Alflololian is born with an individual paranormal gift, such as telepathy or telekinesis, which first begins to manifest during childhood at around 2,500 to 3,500 years old. When this happens the young Alflololian's name changes to include a description of the gift – e.g. Argol, He-Who-Has-The-Gift-Of-Speaking-In-Minds. It is an important right-of-passage for a young Alflololian male to hunt and kill one of the cruel Furutz that swim in the ocean. Although highly intelligent, Alflololians generally have little interest in wealth or material goods and even less interest in work. They are, however, curious about other cultures and periodically leave their homeworld, in spacecraft pulled from the soil of Alflolol by their ancestors, to visit other worlds. These journeys can often last for thousands of Earth years and usually the entire population leaves together leaving their homeworld deserted. The human settlers from Earth have come to Alflolol, which they have named Technorog, attracted by the valuable natural resources it offers. To provide protection, they have placed huge electro-magnetic relay beacons on the asteroids in the belt that rings the planet. When activated these beacons generate an impenetrable shield around the planet. Ingress and egress is only permitted to authorised spacecraft through a narrow channel that can be opened in the asteroid belt. Alflolol's harsh atmospheric conditions are harmful to humans if exposure to them is prolonged so they live under domes and wear protective clothing when working outside. The domes also simulate an Earth-like cycle of day and night. The capital city they have constructed is called Technorogville and it lies on a hill on the ancestral burial site of Argol's family. Nearby is a forest, known as Ananil to the Alflololians, which leads to the shores of the sea, named Magnet Ocean by the humans, where the settlers use floating platforms to extract magnetic salts which fuel the ultra-light motors of Galaxity's spacecraft. In the surrounding mountains, gigantic mines extract rare metals which are processed and used in manufacturing in the colossal factories that lie on the plains near the desert. Great hydroponic plantations are required to feed the workers who keep this vast enterprise going. The planet is administered by a technocrat Governor who reports to a council representing the business interests on the planet. Notes * The two key themes in this album – the ecological and sociological impact of industrial development and the treatment of indigenous peoples under colonialism – make this one of the most political of the Valérian albums. This is the first time in the series that Galaxity is portrayed in a less than favourable light and is used to hold a mirror up to modern Western society. * This album was translated into English by S.

King, English Reformation Literature: The Tudor Origins of the Protestant Tradition (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982) Shepherd was such a good imitator that several of his poems were misattributed to Skelton. John Bon led to Shepherd's being jailed, but it was popular at court and earned the compliments of Sir John Gresham. John King describes it as \\"a memorable fusion of medieval and Lutheran\\" satire, the latter being represented in the German works of Hans Sachs. The work attacks the feast of Corpus Christi and transubstantiation as the title character, a simple plowman, bests a priest in argumentation about these subjects on the eve of Corpus Christi. King speculates that the publication may have been timed to coincide with the disestablishment of that feast in 1548 by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Shepherd's satires are available in a critical edition by Janice Devereux from the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies.

The APF-M1000 was built specifically to compete with the Atari 2600. The full APF Imagination Machine, including the APF-M1000 console and the IM-1 computer component, originally sold for around ().

Most retailers of the system offered a full and hefty instruction manual to explain how the specialized code works, and a tech sheet that specifies every function of every chip on the console, so as to allow the users to make the most efficient code possible. To encourage more home users to create their own games and trade them, a monthly mailing list lasted well through the video game crash of 1983 and into the next generation of consoles. =Special cassette= One of the most marketed features of the console is the dual-sided cassette drive that allows the user to write or use a stored program, and also to record or play audio. The feature is generally used for programmers to leave notes about their work, or for instructions to be read aloud before a game is played. =Peripherals= The console has a number of aftermarket add-ons: *RS232 Storage Cartridge *Floppy Disk Storage *8k RAM Cartridge *Mini Floppy Disk Storage *Telephone Modem It has a hub of sorts, generally called the \\"building block\\", which allows for the connection of some standard computer accessories. Games In addition to the 1 Basic interpreter cartridge bundled with the system, only 15 official game cartridges were ever released by APF Electronics Inc, although several cartridges contain multiple games. Many games were created by an active programming community of owners and distributed through the monthly newsletter, released on cassette tape or printout. The official game list is as follows: *Artist and Easel *Backgammon *Baseball *Blackjack *Bowling / Micro Match *Boxing *Brickdown / Shooting Gallery *Budget Manager *Casino *Catena *Hangman / Tic-Tac-Toe / Doodle *Pinball / Dungeon Hunt / Blockout *Rocket Patrol *Space Destroyers *UFO / Sea Monster / Break it down / Rebuild / Shoot APF IM-2 console APF had planned on releasing a follow up to the original M1000 Imagination Machine game console, but went out of business just before the console could go to market. No official specs have ever been released, although some former employees have mentioned that it was essentially the same M1000 core with typical upgrades. Development The impetus for the Imagination Machine was to beat to market Atari's preannounced but never-launched plans to extend the Atari 2600 to become a home computer. The design was inspired by reverse engineering the TRS-80, Commodore Pet, and Apple I home computers. Working directly with Fairchild Semiconductor, the team got much of its I/O design from Andy Grove. The engineering department wanted to make the design modular for optional expansion, but the marketing department wanted to bundle some features, so the preliminary result was an integrated cassette tape drive. This was removed when, three months later, the first floppy drives appeared on the market as a superior storage technology. Reception Games magazine said in mid-1980, \\"APF's hardware is impressively solid in both design and performance, and if you're not ready to plunk down $600, you can buy just the game system (MP 1000) for $130 and decide later if you really want the computer component. But it's the whole system that's exciting. If what you want is just a video game, you may as well stick with Atari.\\" Mechanix Illustrated in October 1980 called the system \\"one smart television that's inexpensive, completely programmable, and easy to use\\". The magazine praised its large RAM and ROM capacities, and called it the first computer that can let the user store new data on the same cassette as the application.

Napoleon Bonaparte, recently appointed commander of the French Army of Italy, led a rapid and conclusive attack through Italy as part of the French Revolutionary Wars. In April and May of that year he had defeated Piedmont army and driven the Austrian army out of almost all of Northern Italy. In November, Napoleon joined battle with József Alvinczi near the junction of the Adige and Alpone rivers. Despite lacking basic equipment and food, the French army went on the offensive. On 14 November, they crossed the Adige. All that remained between the two armies now was the Alpone. On 15–16 November, the French made repeated attempts to cross the bridge at Arcole. These initial assaults were beaten back by Austrian firepower. By 17 November, French flanking moves convinced Alvinczi that he was threatened with encirclement and he ordered a tactical withdrawal. The following year Napoleon went on to crush the Austrians at Rivoli, forcing them to sign the Peace of Campo Formio later that year.

The usual rules rely on establishing that a duty of care is owed by the defendant to the claimant, and that the defendant is in breach of that duty. The standard test of breach is whether the defendant has matched the abilities of a reasonable person. But, by virtue of the services they offer and supply, professional people hold themselves out as having more than average abilities. This specialised set of rules determines the standards against which to measure the legal quality of the services actually delivered by those who claim to be among the best in their fields of expertise. The relationship between contract and tort In principle, the tortious liability runs in parallel to liability in contract. Subject to the rules of privity of contract, one who has entered into a contract can sue or be sued on the contract which will set out the terms of the service to be provided by the professional person, and if there is no express term to this effect, there will be an implied term that the service will be performed with reasonable care and skill, per s 49(1) Consumer Rights Act 2015. The standard of care required to satisfy this contractual obligation is the same as in negligence, but the circumstances in which each liability may arise differ in that contracts are voluntarily created between the parties, while the duty of care is imposed by operation of law. However, suppose that a solicitor contracts with a medical expert to prepare a report for the purposes of personal injury litigation. The beneficiary of this work will be the client but there is no direct contractual relationship between the expert and the client. It may therefore be argued that since the parties have decided to arrange their relationships to avoid direct contractual obligations, the client should not be permitted to sue in tort, bypassing the privity rule and any exclusion clauses in the contract. In Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1995] 2 145 the potential effectiveness of this argument was acknowledged in a case where there was a formalised structure of agent and sub-agent, but the general scope of this potential limitation remains unclear. However, it is clear that if there is concurrent liability in contract and tort, the quantum of damages is limited to the actual loss suffered and does not increase because there are two causes of action. In Thake v Maurice [1984] 2 513 a railway guard and his wife had five children living in a three-bedroomed council house and were unwilling to have further children. Thake consulted the surgeon who made it clear that a vasectomy was final and that Thake after the operation would become permanently sterile. Although the vasectomy was properly performed, the effect of this operation was naturally reversed and, not unexpectedly, Mrs. Thake conceived and a daughter was born. It was held that, applying the objective standard, the surgeon had contracted not merely to perform a vasectomy but had contracted to make Mr. Thake irreversibly sterile. The judge relied on the consent forms which stated that the vasectomy would be final. The claim was brought in contract and in tort. Peter Pain found that there was no reason why public policy prevented the recovery of expenses arising from the birth of a healthy child. He awarded damages in respect of the expenses of the birth and the mother's loss of wages but refused damages for the pain and distress of labour holding that these were off set by the joy occasioned by the birth. He did, however, award damages in an agreed sum for the child's upkeep to its seventeenth birthday. The Court of Appeal held that damages should be awarded for pain and suffering \\"per the majority\\" in tort rather than contract. The joy of having the child could be set off against the time, trouble and care in the upbringing of the child but not against prenatal pain and distress. For the latter, damages should be awarded. The case is also interesting because there was an alternative interpretation of the consent form. After sterilisation, some couples want to change their minds because their children have died or because they are seeing better days. Instead of the surgeon giving a guarantee of irreversible sterility which depended on the way in which human tissue healed, the warning of finality could be aimed at telling both husband and wife that they could not change their mind later and complain if the spouse had become permanently sterile. Discussion Even though the general objective standard of care cannot come down, it can be raised where the individual defendant has expressly or impliedly represented skills and abilities in excess of the ordinary person. It is an unfortunate fact of life that some professionals prove to be negligent because even those with the most experience can make a mistake. The consequences to their clients can be disastrous. Thus, professionals providing services in a wide range of situations, from surveyors and estate agents to doctors, solicitors, accountants, financial services providers, Information Technology professionals, patent agents, etc., will be judged by the standards of those claiming to have that same set of skills and abilities. This is the basis of the Bolam test for medical negligence derived from Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957) 1 583. This test is not significantly different from the test used in any other professional negligence litigation, but it causes greater difficulty for the courts than would a claim against, say, a lawyer or an accountant, because of the technical issues involved. In addition, Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd (1964) 465 created the rule of \\"reasonable reliance\\" by the claimant on the skills of the defendant. Cases of professional liability blur the distinction between acts and statements, e.g. a medical specialist prepares a report for personal injury litigation, which can be characterised as a statement, but it must be based on the prior acts of carrying out a review of the medical records and performing a physical examination of the client. Actions nominally based on Hedley Byrne by definition include negligent acts or omissions, even though the ratio decidendi of Hedley Byrne was cast in terms of liability for statements. In Caparo Industries plc. v Dickman (1990) 2 605 the criteria for a duty of care in giving advice were stated in more restricted terms: Following Caparo, the Court of Appeal in James McNaughton Papers Group Ltd. v Hicks Anderson & Co. (1991) 1 134 adopted a more restricted approach, focusing in the adviser's actual and constructive knowledge of the purpose for which the statement was made. Thus, the duty was to be limited to transactions or types of transactions where the adviser knew or ought to have known that the advisee would rely on the statement in connection with that transaction without obtaining independent advice. It also had to be shown that the advisee did in fact reasonably rely on the statement without using his own judgment or obtaining independent advice. In Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd. the Lords reasserted the underlying principle that liability under Hedley Byrne was a voluntary assumption of responsibility for performing the given task by a person rendering professional or quasi-professional services irrespective of whether there was a contractual relationship between the pages. Medical negligence :For a full explanation, see Bolam Test Medical negligence (also known as medical malpractice) differs from other litigation because the claimant must rely on expert medical evidence to establish all the major elements of liability. Causation is particularly difficult to prove because the effects of the allegedly negligent treatment must be distinguished from those of the patient's underlying condition which gave rise to the need for treatment. Further, the assessment of damages is often complicated because the court must compare the claimant's actual condition and prognosis with the hypothetical condition and prognosis if the patient had received competent medical treatment. The court must only compensate for the injuries caused by negligent treatment, not for any underlying condition. In Bolam McNair stated at 587, that the defendant had to have acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a \\"responsible body of medical men.\\" Later, at 588, he referred to \\"a standard of practice recognised as proper by a competent reasonable body of opinion.\\" To determine whether a body of opinion is responsible, reasonable or respectable, the judge will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter. For example, in Hucks v Cole reported in (1993) 4 Med. L.R. 393, a doctor failed to treat a patient who was suffering from septic places on her skin with penicillin even though he knew there was a risk of puerperal fever. Sachs said at 397: Similarly, in Edward Wong Finance Co. Ltd. v Johnson Stokes & Master (1984) 1 AC 296, solicitors had completed a mortgage transaction in \\"Hong Kong style\\" rather than in the English style. The fact that this style was almost universally adopted in Hong Kong did not make it reasonable or responsible because it did not guard against the risk of fraud. Thus, the solicitors were liable for negligence because they should have taken precautions against an obvious risk. But, the Lords in Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority (1997) 4 AER 771 held that it will very seldom be right for a judge to reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert are unreasonable. Legal negligence =Solicitors= As to solicitors, Ross v. Caunters [1979] 3 AER 580, holds that lawyers can owe a duty of care both to their clients and to third parties who suffer loss or damage. In that case, the solicitors failed to prevent a beneficiary from attesting the will. They admitted negligence but denied that they were liable to the claimant, contending (i) that a solicitor was liable only to his client and then only in contract and not in tort and could not, therefore, be liable in tort to a third party, (ii) that for reasons of policy, a solicitor ought not to be liable in negligence to anyone except his client, and (iii) that in any event, the plaintiff had no cause of action in negligence because the damage suffered was purely financial. Applying the principles in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd and Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562, a solicitor who is instructed by a client to carry out a transaction that will confer a benefit on a third party owes a duty of care towards the third party in carrying out that transaction, in that the third party is a person within his direct contemplation as someone who is likely to be so closely and directly affected by his acts or omissions that he can reasonably foresee that the third party is likely to be injured by those acts or omissions. This was confirmed in White v Jones [1995] 1 AER 691 which applied Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 1 AER 568 holding that there is a close and direct relationship characterised by the law as proximity or neighbourhood; and the situation is one where it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose the duty of the given scope upon the one party for the benefit of the other. But in Carr-Glynn v Frearsons [1997] 2 AER 614 the solicitor admitted uncertainty as to whether the will as drawn would be effective. The testatrix undertook to seek out the information needed to clarify the issue. She died more than three years later without verifying the will. White v Jones was distinguished because the testatrix had assumed the duty of care, but the court was critical of the failure of the solicitors to send a letter of reminder. The case law also indicates the necessity for firms of solicitors to keep detailed attendance notes. Gran Gelato Ltd. v Richcliff (Group) Ltd. (1992) Ch 560 involved a solicitor's replies to preliminary enquiries in a conveyancing transaction. It was therefore foreseeable that others would rely on the answers given but the court held that there was no duty of care. A solicitor owes a professional duty of care to the client and no one else. He or she is subject to professional rules and standards, and owes duties to the court as one of its officers. Thus, in general, when acting for the seller of land a solicitor does not owe a duty to the buyer. Similarly, Al-Kandari v J.R. Brown & Co. (1988) QB 665 held that a solicitor acting for a party in adversarial litigation does not owe a duty of care to that party's opponent. This was a family case involving contested custody, where the husband had previously abducted the two children of the parties. Solicitors undertook to keep the husband's passport (which included the children's names) under their control. Bingham said at 675: Further, and perhaps most strikingly, it has been held that a solicitor advising a client about a proposed dealing with his property in his lifetime owes no duty of care to a prospective beneficiary under the client's then will who may be prejudicially affected. In Clarke v Bruce Lance & Co. (1988) 1 WLR 881, it was recognised that solicitors may sometimes give advice which directly prejudices the interests of others who have a relationship with the client. But, so long as this advice is consistent with the duty owed to the client, there will be no liability to that third party. Exceptionally, solicitors have been held to have assumed a responsibility towards the claimant, i.e. in situations analogous to a holding a fund on behalf of both sides of a dispute pending its resolution. =Barristers= In Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd the rule was established that irrespective of contract if someone who possesses a special skill undertakes to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relies upon that skill, a duty of care will arise. The fact that the barrister did not enter into a contract with his solicitor or client ceased to be a ground of justification for the immunity. Nevertheless, in a unanimous decision, Lord Reid said in Rondel v Worsley (1969) 1 AC 191 at 227 that the ancient immunity should be continued on considerations of \\"public policy [which are] not immutable.\\" In Saif Ali v Sydney Smith Mitchell & Co. (1980) AC 198 the scope of the immunity was considered. Lord Wilberforce said at 213 that \\"...barristers . . . have a special status, just as a trial has a special character: some immunity is necessary in the public interest, even if, in some rare cases, an individual may suffer loss.\\" When s51 Supreme Court Act 1981 (substituted by s4 Courts and Legal Services Act 1990) introduced the power to make wasted costs orders against legal practitioners, Ridehalgh v Horsefield (1994) Ch 205 ruled that orders could be made against barristers personally. As to criminal trials, prosecuting counsel owes no duty of care to a defendant: Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1995) QB 335. If a defendant is convicted after a full and fair trial, the remedy is to appeal. An attempt to challenge the convictions by suing the defence advocate would be an abuse of process: Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529. If any challenge is to be made following an unsuccessful appeal, the only legitimate avenue would be the Criminal Cases Review Commission even though the body is under-resourced. But the question remained as to whether a civil action might be maintained if the appeal was successful. In Arthur J.S. Hall and Co. v Simons (2000) 3 AER 673, the Law Lords re-evaluated the public policy issues. The critical factor was the duty of a barrister to the court under ss27(2A) and 28(2A) Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (inserted by s42 Access to Justice Act 1999). The question was whether the immunity is needed to ensure that barristers will respect their duty to the court. In 1967, the answer was that assertions of negligence would tend to erode this duty and accorded a special status to barristers. Nowadays a comparison with other professionals demonstrated that barristers' immunity against being sued in negligence was anomalous. Allowing civil action was unlikely to produce a flood of claims and, even if some claims did emerge, a claimant alleging that poor advocacy resulted in an unfavourable outcome would face the very great difficulty of showing that a better standard of advocacy would have resulted in a more favourable outcome. Unmeritorious and vexatious claims against barristers are simply struck out. Thus, it was no longer in the public interest that the immunity in favour of barristers should remain in either civil or criminal cases. This did not imply that Rondel v Worsley was wrongly decided. But in today's world, that decision no longer correctly reflected public policy. The basis of the immunity of barristers has gone. And exactly the same reasoning is applied to solicitor advocates. =Witnesses= Since Watson v M’Ewan (1905) AC 480,Watson v M’Ewan (1905) AC 480 English law has allowed a public policy immunity to any witness, including those who give evidence that is \\"false and injurious\\" or merely negligent. In Evans v London Hospital Medical College (1981) 1 WLR 184, Drake J. said that, in criminal proceedings, the immunity covered, \\"the statement ...made for the purpose of a possible action or prosecution and at a time when a possible action or prosecution is being considered.\\" He also thought the immunity extended to, \\"...acts of witnesses in collecting or considering material on which he may be called to give evidence.\\" In Stanton v Callaghan (1999) 2 WLR 745,Stanton v Callaghan (1999) 2 WLR 745 Chadwick said: In Arthur J.S. Hall and Co. v Simons (2000) UKHL 38, Lord Hoffmann justified the policy in that without the immunity, witnesses \\"...would be more reluctant to assist the court\\". In Darker and others v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police (2000) 3 WLR 747, the claimant alleged that police officers had conspired with an informant to forge and manipulate records of evidence. Lord Clyde confirmed the immunity for the preparation of a report to be used in court. He said: This confirms the general principle that a witness does not owe a duty of care to anyone in respect of the evidence given to the court. The only duty is to tell the truth. In Part 35.3 Civil Procedure Rules, the expert’s duty is to help the court and this duty \\"overrides\\" any obligation there might be to the client or the person who instructs and/or pays him or her. However, the position in respect of expert witnesses was altered by the decision of the Supreme Court in 2011 in Jones v Kaney, which overruled Stanton v Callaghan. As before, an expert will be liable to his client for advice which is tendered to and relied upon by the client under normal principles. However, as a result of the decision, an expert who provides a report which is adduced in evidence before a court no longer enjoys immunity from suit for claims for negligence or breach of contract (although immunity in defamation remains).

It was situated south of Subic Bay and north of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. Operational history Vietnamese Boy Scouts at the PRPC Opened in 1980, the Philippine Refugee Processing Center (PRPC) prepared Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian refugees, including ethnic minorities (such as the Chinese) from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, for immigration to a variety of resettlement nations such as Canada, Norway, Australia, France, and primarily the United States. An estimated 400,000 number of refugees were said to have settled in the area. On February 21, 1981, Pope John Paul II visited the site and held a field mass which was attended by various refugees of different religion. During his visit, he sought for love and compassion for the Indochinese refugees and called for other nations to assist them in rebuilding their war- torn lives. A Vietnamese refugee crafted a wooden cross and gave it to the pope as tribute. In honor of the pope's visit, the Bataan Technology Park built the Replica of Papal Shrine near the actual grounds of where the mass was once held. It was inaugurated on May 2, 2011, the same day when Pope John Paul II was beatified in Rome.http://atmanda.com/news-and-events/ PRPC funding came to an end in the early 1990s as the wave of Indochinese refugees went from a flood to a trickle. The site was permanently closed and fell to looters and squatters, and eventually into disrepair by the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, the Government of the Philippines decided to reclaim the site from the jungle, and turned it into the Bataan Technology Park, loosely associated with the new complex which had been built on the nearby site of the former Subic Bay Naval Base. A museum dedicated to the refugee camp and experience now stands on part of the former site as well.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/693786/viet-refugees-roamed-this-bataan-camp Organization PRPC was funded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and was capable of holding up to 18,000 refugees at any one time. Coupled with a large population of Filipino and employees from other developing countries, PRPC operated like a small city with schools, hospitals, libraries, restaurants, sports facilities, fire brigades, sewage treatment facilities, power generation facilities, water treatment centers, markets, and houses of worship for four religions. Refugee accommodation A board showing statistics in the center from 1980 to 1990 The main functions of the camp were to hold the refugee population long enough to complete tuberculosis testing, wrap up bureaucratic requirements before departure, and—assuming the refugee was heading to an English speaking nation—give them an opportunity for English as a second language training. Virtually all refugees had confirmation before arrival at PRPC that they had been accepted to resettle in the West and therefore the mood among the refugee population was frequently upbeat and positive. The ESL program was operated by the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) and was funded by the U.S. Department of State. ICMC provided training to adult refugees aged 17 to 55. Aside from ESL classes, it offered Cultural Orientation (CO) and Work Orientation (WO). A similar ESL program was offered to children by World Relief through an extensive primary education program that took place within classrooms throughout the site.

All subsequent rows are described as modern day rows.\\"Completed ocean rows in chronological order\\". oceanrowing.com. The Ocean Rowing Society International. Retrieved January 8, 2019.  History  The first ocean to be deliberately rowed across was the Atlantic by Frank Samuelsen and George Harbo, two Norwegian-born Americans, in June 1896. The pair left Battery Park, Manhattan, on 6 June 1896, arriving on the Isles of Scilly, 55 days and 13 hours later, having covered . They continued to row to Le Havre, France. The first solo crossing of an ocean was completed by John Fairfax of Britain on 19 July 1969. He rowed from Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands to Hollywood Beach, Florida in 180 days. In the same year Tom McClean, also of Britain, rowed from Newfoundland, Canada arriving in Blacksod Bay, Ireland on 27 July 1969. Despite having left almost four months after Fairfax, he came within 8 days of beating Fairfax to the title of first solo rower of any ocean. In 1974, Derek Paul King and Peter Bird rowed across the Atlantic Ocean from Gibraltar to St. Lucia in Britannia II - the boat designed by Uffa Fox and first rowed by John Fairfax and Sylvia Cook across the Pacific Ocean in 1971/72. Kathleen and Curtis Saville were the first people born in America to row across the Atlantic Ocean from Casablanca to Antigua in 1981 and Kathleen was the first woman to row the North Atlantic Ocean. Kenneth Crutchlow, the founder of ORSI, was the major contributor to popularizing ocean rowing.  Atlantic crossings  Amyr Klink was the first person to row across the South Atlantic, leaving from Lüderitz, Namibia on 9 June 1984 and arriving 101 days later in Salvador, Brazil on 18 September 1984. In September 1987, Don Allum became the first to row the Atlantic in both directions, having successfully completed a 77-day solo journey from Newfoundland, Canada to Achill Island, Ireland and having previously rowed from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 1971 with his cousin Geoff Allum, in 73 days. An eleven-man French crew aboard La Mondiale set the record for the fastest ocean rowboat to cross the mid- Atlantic, from Santa Cruz de La Palma to Martinique, in 1992 at 35 days, 8 hours, and 30 minutes. On 3 December 1999, Tori Murden of the United States became the first woman to row any ocean solo when she arrived in Guadeloupe, having set off from Tenerife in the Canary Islands 81 days earlier. In March 2006, Julie Wafaei of Canada became the first woman to row across the Atlantic from mainland to mainland.Ocean Rowing Angus Adventures On 10 July 2005, the Vivaldi Atlantic four-man team (Nigel Morris, George Rock, Steve Dawson, Rob Munslow) set the record for fastest unsupported row from St John's, Newfoundland to the longitude of Bishop Rock lighthouse, United Kingdom. They left on 31 May 2005, arriving back on 10 July 2005 in a time of 39 days 22 hours and 10 minutes setting a Guinness World Record. The Vivaldi Atlantic four also became the first four-man team ever to row the North Atlantic west to east. The fastest unsupported row from the United States to England was set in 2005 by The Ocean Fours (NL) (Gijs Groeneveld, Robert Hoeve, Jaap Koomen, Maarten Staarink) with the Vopak Victory. They left New York on 27 May and crossed the Bishops Rock longitude 60 days, 16 hours, and 19 minutes later. This record was beaten by Leven Brown and his crew in 2010. Their boat Artemis Investments left New York on 17 June 2010 and arrived in St Mary's on 31 July 2010 in a time of 43 days 21 hours 26 mins and 48 seconds.

The race begins in early December, with up to 30 teams participating from around the world.  Pacific Ocean rowing  Following his successful Atlantic Ocean crossing, John Fairfax set off from San Francisco in California on 26 April 1971 with Sylvia Cook. After three stops (in Mexico, Fanning Island and the Gilbert Island of Onotoa), the two arrived on Hayman Island in Australia 361 days later on 22 April 1972. Cook became the first woman to row any ocean. Kathleen and Curtis Saville were the first to row from South America (Callao, Peru) to Cairns, Australia from 1984 - 1985. Their journey was recorded on the Ocean Rowing Society's site. Kathleen is also the first woman to row across two oceans - Atlantic Ocean in 1981 and South Pacific Ocean from 1984 to 1985. In 1976 Patrick Quesnel completed a crossing from Washington State to Hawaii, a journey of which took him 114 days.Quincey, C. (1977). Tasman Trespasser, page 202. Auckland: Hodder & Stoughton. In 1977 Colin Quincey became the first to cross the Tasman Sea, the segment of the Pacific Ocean between Australia and New Zealand.

The first person to row the width of the Pacific Ocean solo was Peter Bird of Britain. Bird set off from San Francisco, California and arrived at the Great Barrier Reef Australia 294 days later on 14 June 1983. Bird would later die attempting the west to east journey across the Pacific. Briton Jim Shekhdar later made the claim to be \\"the first person to row across the Pacific single-handed\\". Shekhdar had rowed across the Pacific non-stop, solo and unassisted arriving in Australia on 30 March 2001. Some within the sport felt that Shekhdar had not given due credit to the achievement of Peter Bird and the term \\"unassisted\\" also came under some scrutiny. Roz Savage rowed from San Francisco to Hawaii in 2008, the first woman to do so solo, and from Hawaii to Tuvalu in 2009. She completed the third leg her trip (from Tuvalu to PNG) in 2010 and so became the first woman to row across the Pacific Ocean unassisted. Chris Martin and Mick Dawson rowed a two-man boat from Choshi, Japan to San Francisco Harbour, USA in 2009. Their journey took 189 days and in doing so they achieved the Guinness World Record for being the first team to row across the North Pacific Ocean.Guinness World Records 2011 page 118 From 10 July 2007 to 17 May 2008 Erden Eruç rowed westward from Bodega Bay, California for a total of 312 consecutive days, setting the current world record for a non-stop unassisted ocean row. Eruç completed a solo human-powered circumnavigation from 2007 to 2012, crossing the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans becoming the first person to row all three. From 22 December 2013 to 31 May 2014 Fyodor Konyukhov crossed Pacific Ocean starting in the Chilean port of Concón and finishing in Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia without entering ports and without any external help or assistance. He covered the distance of more than 17408 km (9400 nautical miles) on the Turgoyak rowboat in just 162 days.62 yo Russian solo sailor crosses Pacific on rowboat covering 17,000km in just 162 days On 26 December 2015, British-born Canadian, John Beeden, 53, became the first person to successfully row non-stop, unassisted from North America to Australia covering 7400 nautical miles in 209 days. Beeden had previously completed a non-stop, solo Atlantic crossing in 2011. =Great Pacific Race= In June 2014, the first rowing race to take place on the Pacific Ocean started from Monterey, California, and ended in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Great Pacific Race was organized by New Ocean WaveOcean Wave homepage which is run by Chris Martin and Roz Savage, both experienced ocean rowers.New Ocean Wave - About us Thirteen crews started the first Great Pacific Race in June 2014—four solo crews, three pairs, and six four-person teams representing ten nationalities. Due to logistical difficulties, some crews did not pass mandatory boat checks before the start of the race, and the decision was taken to operate a split start. Crews who were ready started on June 9, and the rest departed during the next available weather window on June 18. Rough weather at the start prompted several of the entrants to retire in the first few days. The pairs team Clearly Contacts retired after due to sea sickness and rowed back to Monterey. The solo entrant, Daryl Farmer, also accepted a tow by one of the race support boats after severe sea sickness that lasted several days.Statement on Daryl Farmer / Rowing 4 Reefs Other crews retired early for various reasons. The crew of Pacific Rowers was rescued by a USCG helicopter when their boat started to take on water after a few days at sea. One of the support vessels for the race had arrived at the scene but was unable to recover the crew due to the severe weather. The USCG rescue swimmer said it was, \\"the most challenging rescue I've ever had.\\" Of the thirteen crews that started the race, seven successfully made it to Honolulu. The winner of the race and the first fours team to ever row the Pacific was Team Uniting Nations comprising rowers from the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Great Britain.Uniting Nations is first boat to row from Monterey to Hawaii in Great Pacific Race. They completed the course in 43 days, 5 hours, and 30 minutes.

Sami Inkinen and Meredith Loring of Fat Chance Row were rowing to promote the dangers of sugar in the diet and completed the row having had a diet primarily based on fats and proteins.Expedition The married couple, rowing in an open class row boat had completed the race in the second fastest time. Since they were not ready for the first start of the race on June 9, they started late and posted an official finish time of 53 days, 23 hours, and 43 minutes. The remaining fours crews of Pacific Warriors and Boatylicious were approaching Hawaii as Hurricane Iselle became a threat. A race support yacht towed Pacific Warriors the final to O'ahuDay 58 Race Report before returning to sea the next day to accompany Boatylicious in their final few miles to ensure they reached a safe harbor before the hurricane arrived. Both crews arrived safely at the Waikiki Yacht Club before the hurricane struck the island later that day.Day 59 Race Report The final boat to finish the initial Great Pacific Race was CC4 Pacific. Being several hundred miles behind Boatylicious, the French cousins aboard the classic pairs boat missed Hurricane Iselle but were asked by the race organizers to deploy their parachute anchor to prevent them from rowing into the path of Hurricane Julio which was close behind. CC4 Pacific encountered severe weather with winds in excess of and seas over .Day 61 Race Report The boat never capsized and the pair completed the race in 75 days, 9 hours, and 25 minutes.Great Pacific Race finally reaches conclusion The only soloist remaining at sea after the first few weeks of the race, Elsa Hammond, and her boat Darien were recovered by one of the race's support yachts, far off course, south of Isla Guadalupe, Mexico after 52 days at sea. 2016 race The fastest crossing westbound to Hawaii was set in 2016 by the winning team of Uniting Nations (Carlo Facchino, Fiann Paul, Cyril Derreumaux, and Thiago Silva) with a crossing time of 39 days, 9 hours, and 56 minutes, earning Fiann Paul the third of four overall speed records and the Guinness World Record for \\"The first person to hold current speed records on four oceans.\\" In 2016, Erden Eruç rowed with Louis Bird, the son of Peter Bird, as a substitute for a race partner who had withdrawn for health reasons. They set the fastest time in the classic pair class, 54 days, 3 hours, and 45 minutes, finishing first among three boats in the same class.  Indian Ocean rowing  The Indian Ocean was first crossed by Anders Svedlund of Sweden in 1971. He set off from Kalbarri in Western Australia on 29 April 1971 and arrived near Diego Suarez, Madagascar, 64 days later on 23 June. Sarah Outen, a 24-year-old Briton, left Fremantle, Western Australia on 1 April 2009. Rowing her boat Serendipity, she arrived at Bois des Amourettes, Mauritius, 124 days later on 3 August. She became the first woman soloist to attempt and successfully complete the crossing. The previous speed record for rowing the Indian Ocean was held by the 8 person crew of Audeamus ('Let Us Dare'), who took a little over 58 days to set the new record in 2009. The crew consisted of Bernard Fisset (Belgium); Doug Tuminello, Brian Flick and Angela Madsen (USA); and Helen Taylor, Ian Couch, Simon Chalk and Paul Cannon (UK). Audeamus is the first boat ever to row unassisted, land to land cross the Indian Ocean, landing just a few weeks ahead of \\"Team MSS\\". It is also the first, multi- person boat and the first mixed boat to row the Indian Ocean and the first 8-person boat to row any Ocean. All are Guinness World Records. Helen Taylor and Angela Madsen are the first women to row across the Indian Ocean, landing just a few weeks ahead of Sarah Outen. There are several other Guinness world records associated with the boat. The first all female crew to cross the Indian Ocean left Australia, Geroldton on 19 April 2009 taking 78 days to cross the ocean coming second in the first ever 'Woodvale Indian Ocean Rowing Race'. The Ocean Angels (www.oceanangels.co.uk) supported Breast Cancer Care on their journey, consisting of Fiona Waller, Sarah Duff, Elin Davies and Joanna Jackson. On 19 April 2009 Andrew Delaney and Guy Watts began their unsupported ocean row from Geraldton, Western Australia across the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. They set five world records and broke two race speed records. They were the first pair to row unassisted land to land across the Indian Ocean and they were winners of the ‘pair’s class’ in the inaugural Indian Ocean Rowing Race. From 13 July 2010 to 20 April 2011 Erden Eruç set four Guinness World Records for rowing on the Indian Ocean as part of his successful first solo human-powered circumnavigation, becoming the first person to row from mainland Australia to mainland Africa, completing the greatest distance rowed on the Indian Ocean from mainland Australia to Madagascar and across the Mozambique Channel to mainland Africaand the greatest distance rowed solo as well as the greatest distance rowed non-stop on the Indian Ocean from Australia to Madagascar. On 5 August 2013, Maxime Chaya (Lebanon) and his 2 team mates Stuart Kershaw (England) and Livar Nysted (Faroe Islands) arrived in Mauritius 57 days, 15 hours, and 49 minutes with the average speed of 2.27 knots after setting off from Geraldton, Western Australia aboard rowboat tRIO. They set a new world speed record, beating the previous one set by an 8-person crew in 2009. In addition, the trio Chaya, Kershaw and Nysted became the first 3-man team to cross the Indian or any ocean.https://www.rowingtheindianocean.com/ The fastest crossing of the Indian Ocean was set in 2014 by a six-man crew aboard Avalon: (Leven Brown, Jamie Douglas-Hamilton, Tim Spiteri, Fiann Paul, Cameron Bellamy and Heather Rees- Gaunt) with a crossing time of 57 days from 10 hours and 58 mins from Geraldton, Australia to Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles with an average speed of 2.65 knots covering distance 600 nautical miles longer than the previous world record holders which calculates into approximately 10 days advantage over the previous record holders. The crew also set the record for the longest distance rowed by a crew. It was the second of 4 overall speed records allowing Fiann Paul to earn Guinness title of \\"The first person to hold current speed records on 4 oceans\\" in 2017. Fiann Paul, Alex Gregory and Carlo Facchino ocean rowing aboard Polar Row II  Arctic Ocean rowing  Polar Row (composed of Polar Row I and Polar Row II) in total covered 1251 Nautical Miles measured in a straight line (1440 Miles or 2361 Km) in the Arctic Ocean and pioneered ocean rowing routes from Tromsø to Longyearbyen, from Longyearbyen to the Arctic Ice Shelf (79'55'500 N) and from the Arctic Ice Shelf to Jan Mayen. They became the most record-breaking ocean row and the most record-breaking man-powered expedition, claiming over a dozen world records in total. Polar Row I: The fastest crossing of the Arctic Ocean was set in 2017 by a five-man crew aboard Polar Row I, (Fiann Paul, Tor Wigum, Tathagata Roy, Carlo Facchino, Jeff Willis) with a crossing time of 7 days and 7 hours, from Tromsø, Norway to Hornsund and next to Longyearbyen (additional 36h), Svalbard, with an average speed of 2,58 knots. In total they covered distance of 600 miles (521 nm) (965 km), breaking the existing Arctic Ocean overall speed record by 3,5 times. Polar Row I's triumph was the biggest record demolition in the history of Ocean Rowing. Arctic Ocean overall speed record was set higher than the Pacific Ocean overall speed record. Even more, it was the first recorded complete row across the Barents Sea. After this crossing captain Fiann Paul became the first person to row all 4 oceans. It was the 4th of 4 overall speed records claimed by Fiann Paul and upon this achievement he received Guinness Titles of: \\"First to row 4 Oceans\\" and \\"First to hold current speed records on all 4 oceans\\". The crew also broke the 27-years-standing record of Northernmost Latitude reached by a rowing vessel. Polar Row II: In Longyearbyen 3 of the 5 crew members were replaced and one new member joined, forming the 6 man team of Polar Row II. The new rowers were Danny Longman, Alex Gregory, Samuel Vie and Tyler Carnevale. The crew rowed North to the Arctic Ice Shelf, reaching the Northernmost latitude attained by a rowing vessel.http://oceanrowing.com/Polar_row2017.htm The crew then turned South, to continue on their journey to Iceland. Heavy weather and equipment failure lead to a decision to change course, with the crew arriving safely in Jan Mayen under their own power. On Jan Mayen four of the six crew members decided they would not continue to Iceland for health reasons. Captain Fiann Paul and Carlo Facchino aimed to continue to Iceland which was an additional 350 nautical miles south. Fiann organized Team Polar Row III (Fiann Paul, Carlo Facchino, James Plumley, Arnar Már Árnason, Gísli Hjartarson, Yngvi Yngvason) and attempted to have 4 new rowers transported to Jan Mayen by a private plane from Iceland, but the airplane didn't receive the landing permit due to military restrictions on Jan Mayen. After multiple attempts of trying to solve the logistics Fiann declared the expedition finished in Jan Mayen. Fiann Paul and Carlo Facchino became the first people to row the Arctic Ocean both directions. Circumnavigation of Britain In 2005, four British army officers rowed around Great Britain in 26 days. Guinness World Records designated their effort as \\"fastest unsupported row circumnavigating UK mainland waters\\". In 2008 and 2009, the challenge was independently attempted again, each ending in failure. In 2010, Sir Richard Branson sponsored the inaugural multi boat race, called Virgin GB Row 2010. Four crews entered but only two made it through rigorous scrutiny to the Start line. The men's crew in ORCA were forced to retire as the boat lost its anchor at Wolf Rock, off Lands End, leaving the ladies crew to complete the race in 51 days, setting a world record as the fastest unsupported female four to complete the entire challenge, starting and finishing at Tower Bridge in London. The all female crew was composed of Belinda Kirk, 35, from Bristol, Royal Navy nurse Laura Thomasson, 23, from Kent, IT support manager Beverley Ashton, 29, from Oxfordshire, and former US Marine Angela Madsen, 50 from Long Beach, California. In 2010, two Army doctors, Nick Dennison and Hamish Reid, circumnavigated Britain in a single journey in an ocean rowing boat. The pair started and finished in Lymington, and completed the journey in 50 days and 5 hours.BBC 1 July 2010 - Row for Heroes pair set world record around Britain On 1 June 2013, 6 boats set off for the honours of World Records plus a chance at winning £100,000 to the first boat to beat the fastest time world record. Southern Ocean rowing A boat captained by Fiann Paul crossed the Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the Antarctic Peninsula in December 2019. The six- man crew also included first mate Colin O'Brady, Cameron Bellamy, Andrew Towne, Jamie Douglas-Hamilton, and John Petersen. The row was the first entirely human-powered crossing of the Southern Ocean, taking 12 days, 1 hour, and 45 minutes. Mediterranean Sea Rowing A biennial series of ocean rowing races in the Mediterranean Sea between Barcelona and Ibiza began in 2013. Organised by the NOMAN is an Island: Race to End HPV Campaign NOMAN is an Island Mediterranean rowing the record is held by Team Monex Europe, who completed the crossing of the Balearic Sea in 54h30 minutes in July 2019.

It was administered by Birkbeck, University of London, one of the constituent colleges of the University of London, and fell under the Humanities list of courses at Birkbeck. The London Consortium was a collaborative program composed of Birkbeck, the Architectural Association, Institute of Contemporary Arts, the Science Museum and the Tate Gallery. As of 2013, The London Consortium exists solely as a legacy partnership between the constituent institutions for the benefit of the remaining PhD students until the completion of their dissertations. History The Consortium was founded in 1993 by the late social philosopher Paul Hirst (1947-2003), Mark Cousins, Richard Humphreys, and Colin MacCabe. Until 1999, the British Film Institute was part of the Consortium. After the BFI (British Film Institute) removed its involvement (due to policy changes and external pressures at that institution), it was replaced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In 2007, the Science Museum joined the collaboration, with its Head of Research, Peter Morris, contributing as a core faculty member. Faculty The Consortium's permanent and adjunct faculty included figures such as the psychoanalytic theorist Parveen Adams, cultural theorist Steven Connor, architectural theorist and philosopher Mark Cousins, Tate curators Marko Daniel and Richard Humphreys, film theorist and producer Colin MacCabe, artist and writer Tom McCarthy, and film theorist Laura Mulvey. Past supervisors and visiting faculty have included cultural theorist Stuart Hall, psychoanalytic theorist Juliet Mitchell, writer Marina Warner, and psychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek. Its chairman was the lawyer and writer Anthony Julius.http://www.mishcon.com/people/anthony_julius Academic Programmes The Consortium offered courses taught by faculty from across all five constituent institutions, including professors from Birkbeck and the Architectural Association, curators from the Tate and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, as well as external faculty drawn from various institutions in London and across the UK. Classes were taught in venues at Birkbeck, the Tate Modern and Tate Britain, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Science Museum. =Masters= MRes Humanities and Cultural Studies The Master of Research programme was available only as a one-year full-time course. It was a unique and challenging post-graduate introduction to theories, methods and knowledges in the humanities and cultural studies. Students combined coursework and research throughout, culminating in the production of a dissertation. The Master of Research was taken as a stand- alone degree in its own right, and also acted as a pathway into the Consortium PhD programme. MA in Film Curating The MA in Film Curating, which was offered for two years beginning in October 2010, was a collaboration between the London Consortium and the London Film School. Bringing together recent thinking about curating contemporary art with the constantly evolving world of film, film festivals, and the movie business, it offered a theoretical exploration into the role of film curating in an age in which digital distribution technologies have transformed both the traditional notion of curating and the commercial film distribution sector. Students also gained practical experience in curating, within the context of existing film festivals like Cannes and Rotterdam, both of which were visited, and through the practical curation of film or film/related events. =Doctoral= PhD Humanities and Cultural Studies The Consortium PhD included a taught component. First year PhD students followed the same core courses as those studying towards the MRes, courses designed to give a grounding in multidisciplinary research. Previous core courses included 'Catastrophe', 'St. Paul', 'Godard's Contempt: Text and Pretext', 'Shit and Civilization', 'Metamorphosis', and 'Whiteness'. Through courses like these, the Consortium could be thought of as developing an original conception of Cultural Studies. While the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University—founded by Richard Hoggart and for a long time the institutional home of Stuart Hall—conceived of Cultural Studies as the study of contemporary popular culture, the London Consortium has sought to develop a research and teaching climate where the study of older historical periods, on the one hand, and of 'high' culture on the other, can take its place alongside the more traditional foci of the discipline. This also entails a different approach to interdisciplinarity. Where interdisciplinary studies had often been content to merely ignore the traditional academic disciplines, and run roughshod over disciplinary boundaries, the London Consortium preferred to describe its activities as multidisciplinary, reflecting the belief that while the best research benefited from being approached from two or more disciplinary perspectives, it must also stand up to the most exacting standards of the disciplines.

He was born in Paisley, Scotland in 1786, the son of a Scottish manufacturer. His family came to Upper Canada in 1801, where his father set up an import-export business. The business failed and his father retired to a farm near Elizabethtown (Brockville). After the death of his father, he opened a general store with his brother, Alexander. He joined the militia during the War of 1812. In 1816, he opened a second store in the new settlement at Perth. In 1818, he was appointed justice of the peace in the area and, in 1820, he was elected to the 8th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Carleton. He represented Carleton and then Lanark until 1836, when he was appointed to the Legislative Council. He also served as lieutenant-colonel in the local militia. He was involved in setting up the first canal connecting the Tay River to Lower Rideau Lake in 1834. Although conservative, he was not part of the elite Family Compact, due in part to his strong affiliation with the Church of Scotland. His efforts to have the church recognized as one of the two national churches in the British Empire resulted in the creation of the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. He also played a major role in establishing Queen's College, later Queen's University and was the first chairman of the board of trustees. He was appointed to the Legislative Council when Upper and Lower Canada were united in 1841. In 1842, he was appointed warden for the Johnstown District. In 1844, he became receiver general for the United Canadas. In 1846, he became president of the Executive Council. He suffered a stroke in 1853, at which point, he retired from active public life; he died at Montreal in 1858. He was the brother of James Morris (Canada West politician).

These tasks remain with the Federal Railway Office (, EBA).  History  In the 1990s, the telecommunications and postal services in Germany were privatized. In 1994, the Deutsche Bundespost, was privatised and split into Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telekom, which remained under the supervision of the Federal Office for Post and Telecommunications (, BAPT). When the market was finally opened for competitors on 1 January 1998, the Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts (, ) was established, superseding the Federal Office as the supervisor for posts and telecommunications. When the government decided to improve competition for the energy and railway markets as of 13 July 2005 and 1 January 2006, it found that the Regulatory Authority's expertise in enabling open access to telecommunication networks would also be useful in these infrastructure markets. To reflect these new competences, the authority was renamed to Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Posts and Railway (, ).

He is best known as a co-author of the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Biography Baigent was born on 27 February 1948 in Nelson, New Zealand and spent his childhood in the nearby communities of Motueka and Wakefield. His father was a devout Catholic, and he was tutored in Catholic theology from the age of five years. After his father left the family when Baigent was eight years old, he went to live with his maternal grandfather, Lewis Baigent and took his surname. His great-grandfather, Henry Baigent served as a Nelson city mayor and had founded a forestry firm, H. Baigent and Sons. His secondary schooling was at Nelson College, and then he moved on to the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, initially intending to study science and continue in the family career of forestry, but switched to studying comparative religion and philosophy. After graduating in 1972, Baigent made extensive travels to different countries, as a freelancer. He did stints as a war-photographer in Laos and as a fashion-photographer in Spain, before arriving at England in 1976. Whilst working at the BBC photographic department and staking in night shifts at a soft-drinks factory, he came across Richard Leigh via a TV producer who was producing a series on Knights Templar. Leigh was to be his frequent co-author across his entire life, and together they sough to unravel the alleged mystery of Rennes-le-Château in France, whose details were put forward in Holy Blood, Holy Grail. In 2000, Baigent also earned an MA in Mysticism and Religious Experience at the University of Kent. A Freemason and a Grand Officer (2005) of the United Grand Lodge of England, he was an editor of Freemasonry Today from Spring, 2001 to Summer, 2011 and advocated for a more liberal approach to Freemasonry. Baigent married Jane, an interior designer in 1982 and had two daughters, Isabelle and Tansy along with two children from her earlier marriage. He died from a brain haemorrhage in Brighton, East Sussex on 18 June 2013.  Works  =Holy Blood, Holy Grail= Published on 18 January 1982, Holy Blood, Holy Grail popularised the hypothesis that the true nature of the quest for the Holy Grail was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a child together, the first of a bloodline which later married into a Frankish royal dynasty, the Merovingians, and was all tied together by a society known as the Priory of Sion. The theory that Jesus and Mary were in a carnal (physical) relationship is based on Baigent's interpretation of the Holy Kiss on the mouth (typically between males in early Christian times, thus signifying Mary's emancipation), and spiritual marriage, as given in the Gospel of Philip. It was earlier perpetuated by authors Laurence Gardner and Margaret Starbird.  Popular reception  The book was a bestseller at the time of publication in America; some Catholic countries chose to ban the work for blasphemy. It regained popularity after the publication of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and sold over six million copies.  Critical reception  On the day of publication, historian Marina Warner noted the book to be filled with lurid falsehoods and distorted reasoning.The Times, 18 January 1982. Soon enough, the authors had a public clash on a BBC broadcast with her and the Bishop of Birmingham. In a scathing review of the book for The Observer, critic Anthony Burgess wrote: \\"It is typical of my unregenerable soul that I can only see this as a marvelous theme for a novel.\\" A Kirkus Review described the work as an intriguing phantasmagoria wherein the authors jumped \\"perilous heights to reach crazy conclusions\\". Colin Henderson Roberts, reviewing for London Review of Books, noted that the work advanced a preposterous hypothesis and made major blunders in its quest to get simple reductive answers from complex questions. In the immediate aftermath of the publication of The Da Vinci Code, The New York Times Book Review deemed Holy Blood, Holy Grail to be among the all-time great works of pop pseudo-history. John J. Doherty, literature librarian at Northern Arizona University, writing in King Arthur in Popular Culture, describes of the work as being \\"thoroughly debunked by scholars and critics alike\\". Arthurian scholar Richard Barber commented the work to be a \\"notorious pseudo- history\\", which advanced its arguments on innuendo and fertile speculations, and would take a book of equal length to be dissected and refuted in entirety. In 2005, Tony Robinson critically interrogated the main arguments of Brown, Baigent and Leigh over a program on Channel 4, and termed the entire episode to be a hoax. Arnaud de Sède, son of Gérard de Sède, stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of a 1,000-year-old Priory of Sion, and described the story as \\"piffle\\".Tony Robinson (presenter) (3 February 2005). The Real Da Vinci Code. Channel Four Television. With increasing proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films centered around Baigent's works, many critics regard the work to have been highly influential in the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and pseudohistory in public psyche. Damian Thompson noted the book to \\"employ the rhetoric of authentic history, but not its method, to present myths as fact\\". Laura Miller writing for Salon (website) described the book to have advanced a preposterous idea in stages - first as a wild guess, then as a tentative hypothesis, and lastly as an undeniable fact - but entirely from within a miasma of bogus authenticity. Dan Brown lawsuit Some of the ideas presented in Baigent's earlier book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, were incorporated in the bestselling American novel The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown.NZ author claims copyright breach in Da Vinci Code, 28 February 2006 In The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown named the primary antagonist, a British Royal Historian, Knight of the Realm and Grail scholar, Sir Leigh Teabing, KBE, also known as the Teacher, in homage to the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail. The name combines Richard Leigh's surname with 'Teabing', an anagram of Baigent. In March 2006, Baigent and Leigh filed a lawsuit in a British court against Brown's publisher, Random House, claiming copyright infringement.Kiwi author takes on Dan Brown, 1 March 2006 Concurrent with the plagiarism trial, Baigent released a new book, The Jesus Papers, amid criticism that it was just a reworking of themes from Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and timed to capitalize on the marketing hype around the release of the movie The Da Vinci Code, as well as the attention brought by the trial. In the postscript to the book (p. 355), Baigent points out that the release date had been set by Harper Collins long before. On 7 April 2006, High Court judge Peter Smith rejected the copyright-infringement claim by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, and Dan Brown won the court case. On 28 March 2007, Baigent and Leigh lost their appeal against this decision and were faced with legal bills of about 3 million pounds.see Guardian article = The Inquisition = Bernard Hamilton, writing in the English Historical Review, described Baigent's treatment of The Inquisition as pursuing \\"a very outdated and misleading account\\", which ignored all modern development in Inquisition Studies and grossly exaggerated its power and influence, to the extent of being polemical. Writing in the Spectator magazine, Piers Paul Read deemed the authors to have penned a misinformed diatribe against Catholicism, with nil interest in \\"understanding the subtleties and paradoxes in the history of the Inquisition\\". A review over The Independent noted of it to be mostly drab and uncontroversial, in reiterating facts which were already known for decades but which progressively gave way to hysteria, in its bid to draw a parallel between the ancient institution and current abuse of power by Catholic authorities. Dongwoo Kim, writing over Constellations (journal) noted the book to not be a significant contribution in the field, in that it was an epitome of Whig historiography which sought for a binary categorization of the past between good and evil, whilst locating the Catholic Church as the \\"antithesis of modernity and liberalism\\". Baigent himself conceded that none of his theories yielded any positive results: \\"I would like to think in due course a lot of this material will be proven,\\" he said, \\"but it’s just a hope of mine.\\"DaVinci, other books fit conspiracy fixation = Other = Later, he and Leigh co-authored several books, including The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception (1991) in which they primarily followed the controversial theories of Robert Eisenman concerning the interpretation of the Scrolls.

It was formerly referred to as the Nilgiri verditer flycatcher because of its similarity to the verditer flycatcher, a winter migrant to the Nilgiris, which, however, has distinct dark lores and a lighter shade of blue. There are two small white patches at the base of the tail. It is found mainly in the higher altitude shola forests of the Western Ghats and the Nilgiris. Identification This small and somewhat long-tailed flycatcher is about . It is dark steely indigo blue with some violet-blue on the forehead and darker lores. It is much darker than the verditer flycatcher and does not have as strong a contrast in the pale face and black lores. The female is duller with dark brown on the upperparts and dark grey below. The two central tail feathers are blue and the lateral feathers are dark brown and edged with indigo. The base of the outer tail feathers are white but this is not easily visible when the bird is sitting. The wing feathers are dark brown with a narrow outer fringe of blue. The juvenile is dark brown with creamy spots and a scaly appearance on the throat and breast. The bill and legs are black and the iris is dark brown. Distribution This species is found in the higher hills (mostly above 1200 m) of the Nilgiris, Palnis, Anamalai ranges, the Brahmagiris, Bababudan and Biligirrangan hills. Behaviour and ecology Egg Like most flycatchers, it makes sallies to capture insects and returns to its perch. It forages mainly in the lower storey but can sometimes be found on top of the canopy. The song is a series of rich warbling notes (having a resemblance to the call of the pied bushchat) while the usual call is a soft nasal chipping eep. They perch upright and produce the chipping note while flicking the tail up and down. The breeding season is from March to June but peak egg-laying is in April. The nest is built in a cavity in an earth bank or a tree hole. They also use the eaves of houses and wood-work of bridges. The nest is a cup with mosses and lichens on the outside with some feathers and is not very well lined on the inside. The usual clutch is two to three eggs. The eggs are creamy brown with a dense mottling close along the broadest part of the egg.

The relationship between the Prince of Wales and the married Ward was common knowledge in aristocratic circles. Winston Churchill observed in 1927, after travelling with them on a train, \\"It is quite pathetic to see the Prince and Freda. His love is so obvious and undisguisable.\\" =Marriages and children= Freda was married twice. Her first marriage was on 9 July 1913 to William Dudley Ward, Liberal MP for Southampton. Her first husband's family surname was Ward, but 'Dudley Ward' became their official surname through common usage. Their divorce took place on the ground of adultery in 1931. They had two daughters: * Penelope Ann Rachel Dudley Ward (1914–1982), the actress Penelope Dudley- Ward, later Lady Reed, known as Pempie, who married firstly in 1939 (divorced 1944) Anthony Pelissier, by whom she had a daughter, and secondly in 1948 film director Sir Carol Reed, by whom she had a son.

This article presents cryptographic aspects of the problem. For an overview, see disk encryption. For discussion of different software packages and hardware devices devoted to this problem, see disk encryption software and disk encryption hardware. Problem definition Disk encryption methods aim to provide three distinct properties: # The data on the disk should remain confidential. # Data retrieval and storage should both be fast operations, no matter where on the disk the data is stored. # The encryption method should not waste disk space (i.e., the amount of storage used for encrypted data should not be significantly larger than the size of plaintext). The first property requires defining an adversary from whom the data is being kept confidential. The strongest adversaries studied in the field of disk encryption have these abilities: # they can read the raw contents of the disk at any time; # they can request the disk to encrypt and store arbitrary files of their choosing; # and they can modify unused sectors on the disk and then request their decryption. A method provides good confidentiality if the only information such an adversary can determine over time is whether the data in a sector has or has not changed since the last time they looked. The second property requires dividing the disk into several sectors, usually 512 bytes ( bits) long, which are encrypted and decrypted independently of each other. In turn, if the data is to stay confidential, the encryption method must be tweakable; no two sectors should be processed in exactly the same way. Otherwise, the adversary could decrypt any sector of the disk by copying it to an unused sector of the disk and requesting its decryption. The third property is generally non-controversial. However, it indirectly prohibits the use of stream ciphers, since stream ciphers require, for their security, that the same initial state not be used twice (which would be the case if a sector is updated with different data); thus this would require an encryption method to store separate initial states for every sector on disk—seemingly a waste of space. The alternative, a block cipher, is limited to a certain block size (usually 128 or 256 bits). Because of this, disk encryption chiefly studies chaining modes, which expand the encryption block length to cover a whole disk sector. The considerations already listed make several well-known chaining modes unsuitable: ECB mode, which cannot be tweaked, and modes that turn block ciphers into stream ciphers, such as the CTR mode. These three properties do not provide any assurance of disk integrity; that is, they don't tell you whether an adversary has been modifying your ciphertext. In part, this is because an absolute assurance of disk integrity is impossible: no matter what, an adversary could always revert the entire disk to a prior state, circumventing any such checks. If some non-absolute level of disk integrity is desired, it can be achieved within the encrypted disk on a file-by-file basis using message authentication codes. Block cipher-based modes Like most encryption schemes, block cipher-based disk encryption makes use of modes of operation, which allow encrypting larger amounts of data than the ciphers' block-size (typically 128 bits). Modes are therefore rules on how to repeatedly apply the ciphers' single-block operations. =Cipher-block chaining (CBC)= Cipher-block chaining (CBC) is a common chaining mode in which the previous block's ciphertext is xored with the current block's plaintext before encryption: : C_i = E_K(C_{i-1} \\\\oplus P_i). Since there isn't a \\"previous block's ciphertext\\" for the first block, an initialization vector (IV) must be used as C_{-1}. This, in turn, makes CBC tweakable in some ways. CBC suffers from some problems. For example, if the IVs are predictable, then an adversary may leave a \\"watermark\\" on the disk, i.e., store a specially created file or combination of files identifiable even after encryption. The exact method of constructing the watermark depends on the exact function providing the IVs, but the general recipe is to create two encrypted sectors with identical first blocks b_1 and b_2; these two are then related to each other by b_1 \\\\oplus IV_1 = b_2 \\\\oplus IV_2. Thus the encryption of b_1 is identical to the encryption of b_2, leaving a watermark on the disk. The exact pattern of \\"same-different-same-different\\" on disk can then be altered to make the watermark unique to a given file. To protect against the watermarking attack, a cipher or a hash function is used to generate the IVs from the key and the current sector number, so that an adversary cannot predict the IVs. In particular, the ESSIV approach uses a block cipher in CTR mode to generate the IVs. Encrypted salt-sector initialization vector (ESSIV) ESSIV is a method for generating initialization vectors for block encryption to use in disk encryption. The usual methods for generating IVs are predictable sequences of numbers based on, for example, time stamp or sector number, and prevents certain attacks such as a watermarking attack. ESSIV prevents such attacks by generating IVs from a combination of the sector number SN with the hash of the key. It is the combination with the key in form of a hash that makes the IV unpredictable. : IV(\\\\textrm{SN}) = E_s(\\\\text{SN}),\\\\ \\\\text{where}\\\\ s = \\\\text{hash}(K). ESSIV was designed by Clemens Fruhwirth and has been integrated into the Linux kernel since version 2.6.10, though a similar scheme has been used to generate IVs for OpenBSD's swap encryption since 2000. ESSIV is supported as an option by the dm-crypt and FreeOTFE disk encryption systems. Malleability attack While CBC (with or without ESSIV) ensures confidentiality, it does not ensure integrity of the encrypted data. If the plaintext is known to the adversary, it is possible to change every second plaintext block to a value chosen by the attacker, while the blocks in between are changed to random values. This can be used for practical attacks on disk encryption in CBC or CBC-ESSIV mode. =Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner (LRW)= In order to prevent such elaborate attacks, different modes of operation were introduced: tweakable narrow-block encryption (LRW and XEX) and wide-block encryption (CMC and EME). Whereas a purpose of a usual block cipher E_K is to mimic a random permutation for any secret key K, the purpose of tweakable encryption E_K^Tis to mimic a random permutation for any secret key K and any known tweak T. The tweakable narrow-block encryption (LRW)Latest SISWG and IEEE P1619 drafts and meeting information are on the P1619 home page . is an instantiation of the mode of operations introduced by Liskov, Rivest, and WagnerM. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner. Tweakable block ciphers , CRYPTO '02 (LNCS, volume 2442), 2002. (see Theorem 2). This mode uses two keys: K is the key for the block cipher and F is an additional key of the same size as block. For example, for AES with a 256-bit key, K is a 256-bit number and F is a 128-bit number. Encrypting block P with logical index (tweak) I uses the following formula: :\\\\begin{align} C &= E_K(P \\\\oplus X) \\\\oplus X,  X &= F \\\\otimes I. \\\\end{align} Here multiplication \\\\otimes and addition \\\\oplus are performed in the finite field (\\\\text{GF}\\\\left(2^{128}\\\\right) for AES). With some precomputation, only a single multiplication per sector is required (note that addition in a binary finite field is a simple bitwise addition, also known as xor): F \\\\otimes I = F \\\\otimes (I_0 \\\\oplus \\\\delta) = F \\\\otimes I_0 \\\\oplus F \\\\otimes \\\\delta, where F \\\\otimes \\\\delta are precomputed for all possible values of \\\\delta. This mode of operation needs only a single encryption per block and protects against all the above attacks except a minor leak: if the user changes a single plaintext block in a sector then only a single ciphertext block changes. (Note that this is not the same leak the ECB mode has: with LRW mode equal plaintexts in different positions are encrypted to different ciphertexts.) Some security concerns exist with LRW, and this mode of operation has now been replaced by XTS. LRW is employed by BestCrypt and supported as an option for dm-crypt and FreeOTFE disk encryption systems. =Xor–encrypt–xor (XEX)= Another tweakable encryption mode, XEX (xor–encrypt–xor), was designed by Rogaway to allow efficient processing of consecutive blocks (with respect to the cipher used) within one data unit (e.g., a disk sector). The tweak is represented as a combination of the sector address and index of the block within the sector (the original XEX mode proposed by Rogaway allows several indices). The ciphertext, C, is obtained using: :\\\\begin{align} X &= E_K(I) \\\\otimes \\\\alpha^j,  C &= E_K(P \\\\oplus X) \\\\oplus X, \\\\end{align} where: : P is the plaintext, : I is the number of the sector, : \\\\alpha is the primitive element of \\\\text{GF}(2^{128}) defined by polynomial x; i.e., the number 2, : j is the number of the block within the sector. The basic operations of the LRW mode (AES cipher and Galois field multiplication) are the same as the ones used in the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), thus permitting a compact implementation of the universal LRW/XEX/GCM hardware. File:XEX mode encryption.svg XEX has a weakness.https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-74462-7_8.pdf section 4.1. XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (XTS) Ciphertext stealing provides support for sectors with size not divisible by block size, for example, 520-byte sectors and 16-byte blocks. XTS-AES was standardized on 2007-12-19 as IEEE P1619. The standard supports using a different key for the IV encryption than for the block encryption; this is contrary to the intent of XEX and seems to be rooted in a misinterpretation of the original XEX paper, but does not harm security., On the Use of Two Keys, pp. 1–3. As a result, users wanting AES-256 and AES-128 encryption must supply 512 bits and 256 bits of key respectively. File:XTS mode encryption.svg On January 27, 2010, NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-38E in final form. SP 800-38E is a recommendation for the XTS-AES mode of operation, as standardized by IEEE Std 1619-2007, for cryptographic modules. The publication approves the XTS-AES mode of the AES algorithm by reference to the IEEE Std 1619-2007, subject to one additional requirement, which limits the maximum size of each encrypted data unit (typically a sector or disk block) to 220 AES blocks. According to SP 800-38E, \\"In the absence of authentication or access control, XTS-AES provides more protection than the other approved confidentiality-only modes against unauthorized manipulation of the encrypted data.\\" XTS is supported by BestCrypt, Botan, NetBSD's cgd, dm- crypt, FreeOTFE, TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, DiskCryptor, FreeBSD's geli, OpenBSD softraid disk encryption software, OpenSSL, Mac OS X Lion's FileVault 2, Windows 10's BitLocker and wolfCrypt. XTS weaknesses XTS mode is susceptible to data manipulation and tampering, and applications must employ measures to detect modifications of data if manipulation and tampering is a concern: \\"...since there are no authentication tags then any ciphertext (original or modified by attacker) will be decrypted as some plaintext and there is no built-in mechanism to detect alterations. The best that can be done is to ensure that any alteration of the ciphertext will completely randomize the plaintext, and rely on the application that uses this transform to include sufficient redundancy in its plaintext to detect and discard such random plaintexts.\\" This would require maintaining checksums for all data and metadata on disk, as done in ZFS or Btrfs. However, in commonly used file systems such as ext4 and NTFS only metadata is protected against tampering, while the detection of data tampering is non-existent. The mode is susceptible to traffic analysis, replay and randomization attacks on sectors and 16-byte blocks. As a given sector is rewritten, attackers can collect fine-grained (16 byte) ciphertexts, which can be used for analysis or replay attacks (at a 16-byte granularity). It would be possible to define sector-wide block ciphers, unfortunately with degraded performance (see below). =CBC–mask–CBC (CMC) and ECB–mask–ECB (EME)= CMC and EME protect even against the minor leak mentioned above for LRW. Unfortunately, the price is a twofold degradation of performance: each block must be encrypted twice; many consider this to be too high a cost, since the same leak on a sector level is unavoidable anyway. CMC, introduced by Halevi and Rogaway, stands for CBC–mask–CBC: the whole sector encrypted in CBC mode (with C_{-1} = E_A(I)), the ciphertext is masked by xoring with 2(C'_0 \\\\oplus C'_{k-1}), and re- encrypted in CBC mode starting from the last block. When the underlying block cipher is a strong pseudorandom permutation (PRP) then on the sector level the scheme is a tweakable PRP. One problem is that in order to decrypt P_0 one must sequentially pass over all the data twice. In order to solve this problem, Halevi and Rogaway introduced a parallelizable variant called EME (ECB–mask–ECB). It works in the following way: * the plaintexts are xored with L = E_K(0), shifted by different amount to the left, and are encrypted: P'_i = E_K(P_i \\\\oplus 2^i L); * the mask is calculated: M = M_P \\\\oplus M_C, where M_P = I \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus P'_i and M_C = E_K(M_P); * intermediate ciphertexts are masked: C'_i = P'_i \\\\oplus 2^i M for i = 1, \\\\ldots, k - 1 and C'_0 = M_C \\\\oplus I \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k-1} C'_i; * the final ciphertexts are calculated: C_i = E_K(C'_i) \\\\oplus 2^i L for i = 0, \\\\ldots, k - 1. Note that unlike LRW and CMC there is only a single key K. CMC and EME were considered for standardization by SISWG. EME is patented, and so is not favored to be a primary supported mode.P.

Life Adalbert, also known as Albert, assisted his brother Count Herbert in his marriage to Queen \\"Ottobega\\" (Eadgifu of Wessex), the mother of Louis IV of France. Adalbert's men escorted (some sources say abducted) Ottobega from the convent in Laon where she resided to her marriage with Herbert, which in turn enraged King Louis.The Annals of Flodoard of Reims, 916–966, eds & trans. Steven Fanning: Bernard S. Bachrach (New York; Ontario, Can: University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. 56There was a prior history between Louis IV and the House of Vermandois as Adalbert's father Herbert II was responsible for the capture, imprisonment and death in captivity of Louis's father King Charles the Simple as well as Louis's own exile to England as an infant. Louis confiscated his mother's holdings, the abbey of Saint Mary in Laon which he gave to his wife Gerberga of Saxony and the royal fisc of Attigny. In 957 Albert and his brother Robert Count of Meaux and Troyes were adherents of King Lothair of France.Albert, through his marriage to Gerberge of Lorraine became the brother-in-law to both Lothar King of France and Charles Duke of Lower Lorraine. Gerberge, Lothar and Charles were all children of Gerberga of Saxony and all three, like Albert, were Carolingians.Heather J Tanner, Families, friends and allies : Boulogne and politics in Northern France and England, c. 879-1160 (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2004), p. 39 n. 34 When Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine decided to assert his rights to the throne he was aided by Albert and Albert's two nephews, Herbert III, Count of Meaux and Odo I, Count of Blois.Geoffrey Koziol, Begging Pardon and Favor: Ritual and Political Order in Early Medieval France (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), p. 149 The two aided Charles in his plots and continued to make trouble for the new king even after Charles was captured and imprisoned. Albert was slow to acknowledge the election of Hugh Capet as King of the Franks. On learning that Hugh intended to attack him, Albert sent Dudo of Saint-Quentin to Normandy to see if Duke Richard I, Duke of Normandy would use his influence to keep the peace between them, which apparently the duke did. For his part Hugh Capet had been suspicious that Albert was about to rebel against him.Lea Shopkow, 'The Man from Vermandois: Dudo of St-Quentin and His Patrons', Religion, Text, and Society in Medieval Spain and Northern Europe: Essays in Honor of J.N.

Family In 954 he married Gerberge of Lorraine († 978),When they married, Albert and Gerberge were well within the seven degrees of consanguinity decreed by canon law at the time. They were third cousins once removed. However this branch of the Carolingians was following its own marital alliance policy irrespective of church canons. See: Régine Le Jan, Famille et pouvoir dans le monde franc (VII-X siècle) essai d'anthropologie sociale (Paris: Publications de la Sorbonne, 2003), pp. 324-25 & 325 table 41. The marriage between Adalbert and Gerberge is an example of what is called affinal \\"relinkings\\" () a term for a couple descended from common ancestors with multiple marriages between the two families over several generations. These alliances were deliberately maintained outside the control of the church. See: The SAGE Handbook of Social Network Analysis, eds. John Scott; Peter J. Carrington; et al.

Early life Brown was educated at the Andrew Cairns Secondary Modern School, Sussex, and the University of York, where he was friends with, and a contemporary of both Harvey Proctor and Christine Hamilton (née Holman).Sleaze: The Corruption of Parliament. David Leigh and Ed Vulliamy Page 50 After studying for a year at Middle Temple, he worked as a graduate management trainee for Barclays Bank from 1972 to 1974 then as a lecturer and tutor at Swinton Conservative College from 1974 to 1975. From 1975 to 1976 he was a part-time research assistant to Michael Marshall MP, working for Nicholas Winterton MP from 1976 to 1979. Westminster Brown was selected for the marginal constituency of Brigg and Scunthorpe and was elected at the 1979 general election. In 1983, following favourable boundary changes, he was elected for the new seat of Brigg and Cleethorpes. This followed a bitter selection battle between Brown and Michael Brotherton, who was MP for the Louth constituency, which included the towns of Immingham and Cleethorpes. Brown threatened to resign from parliament when the village of North Killingholme, in the centre of his constituency was marked as a potential site for nuclear dumping. Derek Laud served as Brown's research assistant for a considerable time as an MP, later becoming a contestant in Big Brother 6. Brown served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Douglas Hogg, Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, from 1989 to 1990, and then at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1990 to 1992. From 1992 to 1993 he was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He was appointed as an Assistant Government Whip in 1993. =Right-wing activity= Brown was involved in the right-wing Conservative circles including the Monday Club and the Eldon League. Brown was a founding member of the No Turning Back group which included Michael Portillo, Peter Lilley and Neil Hamilton. Brown regarded Portillo as one of his closest friends in the early years of the 1980s claiming, \\"we hit it off right away.\\" He accompanied Portillo on holidays with other friends including Laud.Tory Wars by Simon Waters, Page 188 =Southern Africa= Brown was a supporter of South Africa's ruling National Party during apartheid and visited that country with Neil Hamilton on a trip financed by the South African authorities in February 1988. Hamilton went on more than one tour of South Africa. In 1990, Brown's protege Derek Laud became active in support of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), a political party in Namibia backed by the South African government. Laud formed a lobbying group known as Strategy Network International, which lobbied vigorously on behalf of the DTA and later, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). =Cash for questions affair= During his parliamentary career, Andrew Roth's Parliamentary Profiles described Brown as \\"an assiduous free tripper who repays his hosts\\".Roth, Andrew; Parliamentary Profiles During the Cash for Questions parliamentary scandal, Brown admitted to, and apologised for, accepting money to lobby on behalf of US Tobacco without declaring it. He was alleged to have received £6,000 from Ian Greer Associates to lobby on behalf of US Tobacco, and to have failed to declare it in the Register of Members' Interests or to ministers. He was further alleged to have not declared the income from Ian Greer Associates until the payments became publicly known. The Parliamentary investigation found that Brown failed to register an introduction payment from Mr Greer on behalf of US Tobacco and that he \\"persistently and deliberately\\" failed to declare an interest in Skoal Bandits in his dealings with ministers over the issue. He did not immediately declare the payment to the Inland Revenue. Mr Brown also received a free flight to Connecticut to be briefed by the company, which he did record in the Register of Members' Interests. =Resignation= Brown resigned in May 1994 after The News of the World published pictures of him on holiday in Barbados with a 20-year-old gay man. At the time, the age of consent for homosexual activity was 21, so the paper ran the story under the headline \\"Lawmaker as lawbreaker\\". After resigning, Brown subsequently acknowledged his homosexuality. The media linked Brown's resignation to Prime Minister John Major's ill-fated Back to Basics campaign. After Westminster Brown lost the election for the new Cleethorpes seat at the general election on 1 May 1997. Initially he struggled to find employment, working for David Evans’ contract cleaning firm (a fellow Conservative MP who had also lost his seat). In April 1998 he submitted a piece for The Independent on how he was looking forward to being canvassed by the Labour Party candidates for his area in the Westminster City Council elections, which would give him an opportunity to play the kind of tricks voters often play on election candidates. The piece was published and was well received. It led to a regular commission as a political sketchwriter for The Independent starting in 1999, as well as political commentary for other newspapers. Today he regularly appears as a commentator and newspaper reviewer on British television, particularly on BBC News 24 and Sky News. He joined Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in April 2019 but said that he is not planning on contesting elections.

It is found naturally in three distinct populations - in the Flinders Ranges, Eyre Peninsula and on Kangaroo Island. Description The tree notable for its mottled colourful yellow to orange bark, strongly discolourous leaves and inflorescences grouped on leafless branchlets inside the tree crown. The old bark is smooth and grey, shedding in irregular patches to expose the fresh yellowy-brown bark. Flowers are creamy-white in summer. The capsules are barrel to urn shaped. Sugar Gums from the Flinders Ranges reach up to in height and have the classic \\"gum\\" habit - with a straight trunk having a dbh of and steep branches occurring about halfway up. Each main branch ends with its own little canopy. These are commonly cultivated as farm windbreaks and for timber. However, Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island trees are much shorter typically between in height and often have crooked trunks and a dbh of . The crown has an open spreading habit with a typical spread of . The strongly discolorous, glossy adult leaves are arranged alternately supported on a petiole that is in length. The leaf blade is darker green on upper side and paler below with slightly falcate to lanceolate shape and a length of and a width of with a base usually tapering to the petiole. The side-veins in the leaf are at an acute or wider angle and densely reticulate. The intramarginal vein is parallel to but removed from margin with small and obscure oil glands. It flowers in summer producing white-cream-yellow flowers. The axillary unbranched inflorescence occur in groups of buds 7, 9 or 11 buds per umbel. The oblong pale green, yellow to creamy mature buds have a length of and a width of . The buds are often longitudinally striated and scarred with a rounded operculum, inflexed stamens and cuboid to oblong anthers. The urceolate or barrel-shaped longitudinally ribbed fruits that form after flowering are in length and wide with a descending disc and three or four enclosed valves. The light grey to brown seeds within the fruit have a flattened-ovoid shape that can be pointed at one end and are long. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1853 in the journal Linnaea: ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beiträge zur Pflanzenkunde. In 1860, von Mueller referred to Eucalyptus corynocalyx in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, citing several earlier publications, including the Linnaea journal article, but all only have a description of E. cladocalyx. Eucalyptus corynocalyx is therefore a nomen illegitimum and a synonym of E. cladocalyx. The specific epithet is taken from the Ancient Greek words klados meaning branch, \\"twig\\" or \\"stem\\" and kalyx meaning \\"cup\\", \\"cover\\" or \\"outer envelope of a flower\\", in reference to the leafless branchlets that bear the flowers. In 2013, Dean Nicolle describe three subspecies of E. cladocalyx and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus cladocalyx F.Muell. subsp. cladocalyx is a lower-growing, more spreading tree than the other subspecies and has short, broad leaves and larger fruit; * Eucalyptus cladocalyx subsp. crassa D.Nicolle is the tallest-growing subspecies and has long, narrow leaves and large fruit; * Eucalyptus cladocalyx subsp. petila D.Nicolle is a tall subspecies with erect branches, narrow adult leaves and relatively small fruit. Distribution Eucalyptus cladocalyx is endemic to southern parts of South Australia. It is found in three distinct populations, in the southern and central-eastern parts of the Eyre Peninsula, through much of the Flinders Ranges and on Kangaroo Island. It is most likely part of relic forests of wetter climates from the past. It has now become naturalised in the South West region of Western Australia, in southern Victoria, and beyond its native range in some parts of south-eastern South Australia. Also naturalised overseas in northern and southern Africa, in California, Hawaii, Arizona, Israel, Chile, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Subspecies cladocalyx is restricted to the southern and eastern Eyre Peninsula, subspecies crassa to Kangaroo Island and subspecies petila to the southern Flinders Ranges. Uses The tree is commonly planted across southern Australia for use as a windbreak or shelterbelt, or for timber and firewood production. The wood is termite resistant, with moderate strength and durability and can be used for furniture, flooring, posts, construction timber and for railway sleepers. It is a fast growing tree but is best planted in open sun in clay, loam or sandy soils. It is an efficient user of water and drought and frost tolerant with flowers that attract bees. It is also known to be a suitable breeding habitat for the Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoo. E. cladocalyx is well adapted to regular bushfires and can resprout epicormically, producing a large number of seedlings through wind dispersal of seeds. The hard and heavy heartwood is a pale yellow-brown colour and has fine uniform texture with an interlocked grain. The density of the air dried wood is around and is moderately durable. =Use in horticulture= Subspecies cladocalyx is sold in the nursery trade as E. cladocalyx 'Nana'. References * Holliday, I.

Early life Gebran Tueni was born in Beirut on 15 September 1957. His father was a veteran journalist and politician, Ghassan Tueni. His mother was the famous Francophone, Lebanese Druze poet, Nadia Hamadeh. His paternal grandfather was Gebran Tueni, a famous journalist and an Arab Renaissance figure who founded Al Ahrar and later on An Nahar. Gebran Tueni was named after his grandfather. His maternal grandfather, Mohammed Ali Hamadeh, was a diplomat and writer. His maternal uncle is the former Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh and the former journalist of An Nahar newspaper and who was in Saad Hariri political party, Ali Hamadeh. At age 18, Gebran Tueni experienced the horror of sectarian intolerance with the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war. In 1976, he was kidnapped for 36 hours by Christian militiamen in 1977. Education Tueni received bachelor of arts degree in international relations from École des Hautes Études in 1980. At the same period, he studied journalism at Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris and graduated in 1980. He also studied management at CEDEP-INSEAD in 1992. Career Tueni's journalism career started when he became the general manager, editor in chief and editorialist for the weekly magazine An Nahar Arab and International that he and other journalists launched in Paris in 1979 and that was published until 1990. Then, he served as the general director of the daily paper An Nahar from 1993 to 1999 and the general director of the monthly magazine Noun from 1997 to 2000. His friendship with General Michel Aoun led to his exile to Paris from 1990 to 1993. He became an active member of the World Association of Newspapers (WAN) in 1990 and WAN's advisor on Middle-Eastern affairs. He was also a member of WAN’s Fund for Press Freedom Development, created in 1994. Tueni was the publisher, chairman of the board, director and editorialist of An Nahar beginning on 1 January 2000 until his death on 12 December 2005. He came to international prominence in March 2000 when he wrote a front-page letter to Bashar Assad, son and then-heir apparent to then-Syrian president Hafez al Assad calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following the 1990 Taif Accords that ended Lebanon's civil war. With this editorial, he broke an important press taboo. His letter was published when a summit between then-US president Bill Clinton and then-Syrian President Hafez Assad was held in Geneva. Tueni's letter led to a public objection from some newspapers and Lebanese officials. However, other writers agreed with its premises. In April 2001, he cofounded the Qornet Shehwan Gathering together with nearly thirty Lebanese Christian politicians and public figures. In March 2005, he contributed to the Cedar Revolution demonstrations during which he gave the famous speech, \\"In the name of God We, Muslims and Christians, Pledge that united we shall remain to the end of time to better defend our Lebanon\\". In May 2005, he was elected a member of Parliament of Lebanon for the Eastern Orthodox Christian seat in Beirut's first district on an anti-Syrian slate, namely Martyr Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Beirut Decision List, led by Saad Hariri. Views Tueni strongly supported the freedom of speech. He also encouraged the questioning of the Hafez al-Assad's government. He regarded Bashar al-Assad as a \\"new generation\\" leader and had hopes that Syria would finally change its politics towards Lebanese. However, since Bashar al-Assad aligned himself with then-Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, instead of backing Lebanon's \\"democratic forces\\", he was disappointed over time. Then, he became a fierce critic of the Syrian government and its policies in Lebanon. Assassination and burial Although Tueni continued his editorials in An Nahar, he was out of Beirut until shortly before his death. After the assassination of Rafic Hariri, he learned that he was on the top of a hit list and started taking preventative steps, like switching cars every other day. In June 2005, his star columnist Samir Kassir was assassinated. Then, he left Lebanon and stayed in Paris for a while and came back just before 12 December 2005, the day of the assassination. Tueni was assassinated by a car bomb on 12 December 2005 in Mkalles, an industrial suburb of Beirut, while he drove from his home in Beit Meri (Mount Lebanon) to his newspaper’s offices in Beirut’s Martyrs’ Square. Two of his bodyguards were also killed in the blast. He was the seventh target in a series of assassinations of politicians, journalists and security personnel that had begun in Lebanon in 2005. His body was buried at Saint Dimitrius church graves after the funeral that took place at Saint George church in Beirut. Tens of thousands of mourners filled the streets of Beirut for Tueni's funeral on 14 December 2005. Many mourners blamed Syria for his death due to his anti-Syrian policy and they chanted anti-Syrian slogans. The members of the Lebanese parliament also observed a moment of silence during a special parliamentary session. Continuing the play on words with \\"An nahar\\" (The Day), family members stated that night would not fall on the newspaper. =Reactions and perpetrators= Initial reports published in Elaph indicated that a hitherto unknown group, \\"Strugglers for the Unity and Freedom of al- Sham\\" (where al-Sham refers to ancient Greater Syria) claimed responsibility. The statement taking responsibility was also faxed to Reuters and included a warning that the same fate awaited other opponents of \\"Arabism\\" in Lebanon, claiming that the assassination has succeeded in \\"shutting up\\" a traitor, and \\"turning An-Nahar (Arabic for Day) into ″Dark Night″. Several anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians blamed Syria. However, Syrian authorities denied complicity and stated that the crime was aimed at directing fresh accusations against Syria. Commentators stressed that the explosion occurred only a few hours before the UN investigating commission was due to submit an update of its report on the Hariri assassination to then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In response, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora announced that he would ask the United Nations Security Council to investigate Syrian complicity in the deaths of Tueni and other prominent anti-Syrian figures. Before his death, Tueni was campaigning for an international probe into recently discovered mass graves in Anjar next to the main Syrian intelligence headquarters. Forensic analysis later showed the graves were part of an 18th- century cemetery. In his last editorial Tueni accused Syria of committing \\"crimes against humanity\\" and blamed them for the mass graves and other atrocities committed in Lebanon during their presence. His articles and editorials in An Nahar often raised the ire of the Syrians. Koïchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"The global press community has lost one of its great defenders. Mr Tueni’s death is a terrible loss not only for his family, friends and colleagues, but for the cause of freedom of expression and press freedom in the Middle East. I must also voice my concern over the increasing number of attacks on Lebanese journalists and politicians in the course of this year.\\" =Lawsuit= Boutros Harb is the lawyer of the Tueni family, and filed a lawsuit in October 2012 against two Syrian officers due to their alleged roles in Gebran Tueni's assassination. Personal life Gebran Tueni was first married to Mirna Murr who gave birth to two of his daughters, Nayla and Michelle. Mirna Murr is the daughter of Michel Murr, a Lebanese politician. They later divorced. His second spouse was Siham Asseily. He had twin daughters, Gabriella and Nadia, from his second marriage, who were just a few months old when he was killed. Legacy =Gebran Tueni Award= The World Association of Newspapers established a Gebran Tueni Award in 2006 after his death to be bestowed on \\"a newspaper publisher or editor in the Arab world who demonstrates the free press values\\" of the award's namesake. The award has been given the following journalists and media figures: *2012: Ali Farzat, Syrian cartoonist *2010: Aboubakr Jamaï, Le Journal Hebdomadaire, Morocco *2009: Asos Hardi, Awene, Iraqi Kurdistan *2008: Ibrahim Essa, Al Dustour, Egypt *2007: Michel Hajji Georgiou, L'Orient Le Jour, Lebanon *2006: Nadia Al- Sakkaf, Yemen Times, Yemen =Gebran Tueni Human Rights Fellowship Program= The Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Hariri Foundation-USA launched the Gebran G. Tueni Human Rights Fellowship Program on 21 January 2009. The Fellows were planned to undertake a major research project focusing on the areas of freedom of speech, arbitrary detention, or discrimination against minorities, displaced populations, or other vulnerable groups in one or more countries in the Middle East.

Born in Burnt Tree, Dudley, Worcestershire (now West Midlands), Fereday made his debut against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's on 17 July 1899, opening the batting and making 25 and 23 in a crushing 332-run defeat.

In 1900, Fereday made six appearances for the county, though he could muster only 77 runs in 11 innings with a best of just 18. He did, however, take his only two first-class wickets that summer: a caught and bowled dismissal of the little-known Yorkshire bowler Harry Riley and an lbw decision against Warwickshire stalwart Crowther Charlesworth. The following year he made his last two appearances at first-class level, his final match being a thrilling tie against the touring South Africans in which he made a career-best score of 37.

It last played in the Belgian Third Division B during the 2014–15 season where it finished 17th out of 18th and was forced to fold entirely due to financial difficulties. The club was one of the first to register in Belgium, as it became a member of the Belgian Football Association in 1896 and received the matricule n°8.  History  The club founded in 1896 as Verviers F.C., reached the first division in 1900, but was relegated in 1907 as it finished last. Its best ranking at the highest level was a 4th place in 1906. In 1903, the team had merged with Stade Wallon de Verviers to become C.S. Verviétois. Verviers was back at the top level in 1912 but was relegated again 12 years later. It played one season again in the first division in 1925–26 at the end of which the club added Royal to its name after existing for 25 years. The last return of the club to the highest level was in the late 1950s (1956–61) when the team played and won against some of the biggest teams in Belgian football, including Standard Liège, RFC Liège and Anderlecht. Verviers also reached the final of the Belgian Cup in 1956, losing out 2–1 to Tournai at the Heysel Stadium. Following the relegation in 1961, the team slowly dropped into the lower regions of Belgian football, relegating to the Belgian Third Division in 1972, to the Belgian Fourth Division in 1974 and into the Belgian Provincial leagues in 1977. The team managed to return to the Belgian Third Division in 1993 but was relegated again in 2000, when the club merged with R. Dison Sport to become R. Entente Dison-Verviers. Two more name changes were to occur soon after, first to R.E. Dison Verviers (E. is for Excelsior) and subsequently to R.C.S. Verviétois in 2002 when they returned to the Belgian Third Division. Following two more years in the Fourth Division between 2003 and 2005, from then on until the team folded due to financial difficulties in 2015, the team played in the Belgian Third Division. Just weeks after the team folded, a new team was established, named Cercle Sportif Jeunesse Verviétoise, with matricule n°9657 which competed in the 2015–16 season with only youth teams. The intention of the owners is to start playing with a senior team again as of the 2016–17 season, which will be at the ninth and lowest level of the Belgian football pyramid.

Life He was born in Partney, Lincolnshire, and educated at Westminster School. Given patronage as a child by the Puritan, Henry Vane the Younger, he obtained a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1653. This being the time of the English Civil War, he fought for Oliver Cromwell from then until 1655. He was appointed second keeper to the Bodleian Library, but in 1659 his friendship with Henry Vane led to his being removed from this employment. His work A Light Shining Out Of Darkness did not help, being seen as an attack on the clergy. He became a physician in Stratford-upon-Avon, and after the Restoration was confirmed in the Church of England. In 1661 was appointed His Majesty's Physician for Jamaica. The history and antiquities of Bath Abbey Church, by John Britton, 1887 The Jamaican climate disagreeing with him, he returned to England in 1665. He developed medical practices in both Bath and Warwick. In 1673 he wrote against the Duke of York and Mary of Modena in the Paris Gazette. He was arrested and threatened with hanging. He drowned in an accident in Bristol and was buried in Bath. Writings Stubbe was considered by Anthony Wood to be the most noted Latin and Greek scholar of his age, as well as a great mathematician and historian. Following the Restoration he wrote polemical pieces against the Royal Society. They have been interpreted as showing a change in his political and religious views. Recent scholarship suggests, however, that the main theme in his life is continuity and his attacks on the Royal Society are a part of his veiled attack on the clerical and monarchical powers, of which the Royal Society was seen to be supportive. Connected with his assault on the Royal Society was criticism of Francis Bacon:Julie Robin Solomon, Catherine Gimelli Martin, Francis Bacon and the Refiguring of Early Modern Thought: Essays to Commemorate The Advancement of Learning (1605-2005) (2005), p. 76. Stubbe taxed the early Royal Society with being \\"Bacon-faced\\".Deborah A. Redman, The Rise of Political Economy as a Science: Methodology and the Classical Economists (1997), p. 18. Stubbe also supported Thomas Hobbes in his dispute with the mathematician and founding member of the Royal Society, John Wallis.Douglas M. Jesseph, Squaring the Circle: The War between Hobbes and Wallis (1999). In 1671 he wrote An Account of the Rise and Progress of Mahometanism, and a Vindication of him and his Religion from the Calumnies of the Christians. He was unable to publish this book, considered the first work in English sympathetic to Islamic theology; it circulated privately.http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=OTHE00049&mode;=diplomatic He tried to demonstrate the similarity between the beliefs of Islam and Unitarian Christianity. Stubbe can also be seen as part of a growing tradition at this time which expressed a dissatisfaction with intellectual inconsistencies of trinitarianism and sought to discover the original unitarian roots of the Christian tradition in the Middle East. Relative to Judaism, Stubbe in common with John Toland and Edward Stillingfleet followed the lead of John Selden and James Harrington, arguing for religious toleration.James E. Force, Richard Henry Popkin (editors), Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence (1999), p. 156. His diverse interests and sense of genuine intellectual breadth are revealed in his authorship of a book celebrating chocolate, which he refers to as the Indian nectar, and in which he criticised those who refused it on puritanical grounds.

The Chinese frog seismographhttp://engagetolearn.com/ETL/quakeimages/ChineseSeismograph.jpg would have dropped its ball in the general compass direction of the earthquake, assuming a strong positive pulse. We now know that first motions can be in almost any direction depending on the type of initiating rupture (focal mechanism).http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/beachball.htm The first refinement that allowed a more precise determination of the location, was the use of a time scale. Instead of merely noting, or recording, the absolute motions of a pendulum, the displacements were plotted on a moving graph, driven by a clock mechanism. This was the first seismogram, which allowed precise timing of the first ground motion, and an accurate plot of subsequent motions. From the first seismograms, as seen on the figure, it was noticed that the trace was divided into two major portions. The first seismic wave to arrive was the P-wave, followed closely by the S-wave. Knowing the relative 'velocities of propagation', it was a simple matter to calculate the distance of the earthquake.http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/locating.html One seismograph would give the distance, but that could be plotted as a circle, with an infinite number of possibilities. Two seismographs would give two intersecting circles, with two possible locations. Only with a third seismograph would there be a precise location. Modern earthquake location still requires a minimum of three seismometers. Most likely, there are many, forming a seismic array. The emphasis is on precision, since much can be learned about the fault mechanics and seismic hazard, if the locations can be determined to within a kilometer or two, for small earthquakes. For this, computer programs use an iterative process, involving a 'guess and correction' algorithm.http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/info/eqlocation As well, a very good model of the local crustal velocity structure is required: seismic velocities vary with the local geology. For P-waves, the relation between velocity and bulk density of the medium has been quantified in Gardner's relation.

It was nominated for a 2005 Bram Stoker Award for \\"Superior Achievement in a Novel.\\" Plot summary The main character is a shy, lonely, middle-aged man named Gil Stewart. He lives a relatively clean, good, quiet life in Cedar Hill, Ohio, where he owns and runs an antique novelty and collectibles store and also helps to take care of his institutionalized nephew Carson (in a group home), who has Down syndrome. One evening, while returning home from work, he finds an elderly man on the side of the road wearing a bowler hat. The man's hat gets blown away, and as he runs after it, he gets hit by a car. While that is happening, Gil notices two black mastiffs that seemed to be chasing the man and later witnessing the accident. Gil tries to help him, but the man dies. What disturbed Gil were three things: *The man, an apparent stranger, knew Gil by name *Not only did the two mastiffs look like they knew what they were doing, but they also seemed satisfied at the old man's death. *The man-in-the- bowler-hat says the final words \\"The Keepers are coming\\" When he finally arrives home, he encounters an old, wounded and mangy dog lying in his front lawn, which subsequently crawls under his house. As he is deciding what to do with the dog (between taking it to a local shelter, the vet, or simply letting it die in peace where it is), he unexpectedly receives a package delivered by an obscure shipping company. To his surprise, the package was apparently sent from Beth, a woman he loved long ago but who mysteriously disappeared and was presumed dead. Gil soon receives a phone call from Carson's group home: Carson is missing. Gil now is bothered by the following mysteries: *Who sent that package? Was it from Beth? If so, where was she all these years? *Where did Carson go? *Where did that dying dog come from? *How and why did the dying man know Gil's name? *Why are those mastiffs roaming around town? Those questions are answered after going through a bizarre and slightly surreal experience. He is forced to remember many of his repressed experiences of his childhood and young adult years, which, in a convoluted way, are linked to the mysterious incidents involving the old man on the road, the mastiffs, Carson's disappearance, and the mysterious dying stray dog. The feel of the book is very dark and somber. The majority of the book is composed of flashbacks, with the climax occurring during the present day, when he met the old man and the strange dogs. Even though the novel borders on fantasy, real-life issues are dealt with, namely animal abuse, lost pets, aging, and loneliness. Characters note: the names of Gil's immediate relatives are never provided *Gil Stewart - the protagonist of the story. Introduced as a mild mannered bachelor, which the reader later discovers he was also a shy, \\"nerdy\\" teen. Seems to have a special bond with animals, ever since he was a boy. *Beth - Gil's close friend and first love. Was Gil's first \\"girlfriend\\". Even after their relationship ended, they continued to be friends, and he never gave up his feelings for her. Along with her aunt Mabel, owned several dogs. Mysteriously disappears one night after a tearful and emotional conversation with Gil. *Gil's Father - a depressed, angry, and alcoholic World War II veteran. An avid movie buff. Dies in a work-related accident while Gil is still in his late teens. *Gil's Mother - Emotionally distant from Gil. An opera fan. Dies a couple of years after Gil's father passes away, in what Gil speculated was suicide. *Gil's Sister - was never very close to Gil until she became pregnant with Carson. Eventually dies of a latent heart condition, after which Gil becomes Carson's legal guardian. *Mabel - Beth's aunt. Works as a nurse at an assisted living facility. Raised Beth as her own child after Beth's mother relocates to London. Is described by Gil as \\"sad looking.\\" *Marty \\"Whitey\\" Weis - a resident at Mabel's workplace. Uses a wheelchair due to diabetes complications. Develops a close friendship with Gil. His wit and mild cynicism adds a humorous touch to the gloomy feel of the novel. Misses his daughter, an aspiring actress based in Los Angeles who rarely calls him. *Cheryl - one of Gil's employees at his novelty store. Has a deep appreciation for her boss and is mystified by his loneliness. *The Bowlers - Led by an individual which Gil refers to as \\"The Magritte Man\\", a group of mysterious men in derby hats chasing Gil around town. *The Twin Mastiffs - roam throughout town and appear to stalk Gil, and are apparently owned by \\"The Bowlers\\". *Long-Lost - a bizarre-looking character from one of Carson's comic books. What Gil finds disturbing is that Carson claims he can speak to him. Sources *Keepers, Gary A. Braunbeck. 30 September 2005, Leisure Books, External links *Keepers page on Gary A.

History A family of the name Dugan had its territory near the modern town of Fermoy in north Cork, and were originally the ruling family of the Fir Maighe tribal group which gave its name to the town. They also claimed descent from Mug Ruith, the legendary magician of the Fir Bolg. They ceded pre-eminence to the O'Keeffe family in the eleventh century, but remained powerful in the area. Along with the other Fir Maighe families they lost their power when the Normans conquered the territory in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. By the 12th century, family names or surnames had become well established in Ireland in the lands of the Sogain where an illustrious Dugan family held prestige and power due to their descent from the druid Mog Rutih. Some historians believe that with the change over to Christianity, the druids carried on with their profession of \\"filí\\" or seers. These \\"filí\\" were socially very important and held in the same esteem as the king. They enjoyed many privileges and were exempt from military duties. They were the custodians of the oral tradition, which embraced genealogy and history. In Ireland, a man enjoyed his status, rights and privileges in virtue of his descent so that genealogical material was of high political consequence. Dynasties ruled kingdoms by virtue of descent from ancient royal lineages and their genealogy was proof of their legitimacy to rule. Strangely enough, there is no genealogical record available for the Dugans themselves, and Roderick O'Flaherty, the famous 17th century Galway scholar says in his \\"Ogygia\\" that no line of pedigree can be found in any of the authenticated Irish annals which is very strange as this family were professors of poetry and history. The Dugans had their homelands in Fohenagh, east Galway. There are a number of townland names in the area which bear testimony to this i.e. Ballydoogan (Dugan's town), Carterdoogan (Dugan's quarter) and Dundoogan (Dugan's Fort). Some twentieth-century historians and genealogists mistakenly give Ballydugan near Loughrea as the seat of the Dugans but this place has no connection whatsoever with the Dugan clan. This townland was originally known as Ballygardugan or O'Hrdaganstown, and with the passage of time the \\"gar\\" was dropped, leaving it Ballydugan. The most celebrated and best known member of the family is Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin who was author of: Tiallim timpeall na Fodla, a poem which is generally regarded as a description of pre-Norman Ireland, some two centuries earlier; Ata sund seanchus Ereand, a poem of 564 verses on the kings of Ireland down to the high king Roderick O'Connor; Rioghraidh Laigheamn clannchathaoir, a poem of 224 verses on the kings of Leinster; Teamhair na riogh raith Cormacc, a poem of 332 verses which gives an account of the battles and actions of Cormac Mac Airt; Bliadhain so salus a dath, a poem on the festivals of the year, and Faras Focaill luaidhtear libh, a poem of 292 verses, being a vocabulary of obsolete words. He is credited with the introduction of a didactic nature into this generic literature which is also evident in the Books of Uí Máine, Lecan and Ballymore. As Seán Mór held the distinction of ollamh or professor, it is logical to conclude that those later scribes were his students. He retired to the monastery of St.John the Baptist at Rinadoon in Roscommon in 1365 and died there in 1372. The O'Kellys of Uí Máine acquired much of their power and wealth in the 14th century and to their credit, many aspect of Gaelic learning such as genealogy, grammar, poetry, sagas, history and folklore thrived under their patronage. To Murtoogh O'Kelly, bishop of Clonfert and later archbishop of Tuam must go the credit of having produced the great genealogical study known as the Book of Uí Máine. This work was due to his patronage rather than his scholarship, as he employed a staff of six scribes in its production. We do not know the names of these scribes, but it is almost certain that they were members of the Dugan family, as Roderick O'Flaherty refers to the Book of Uí Máine as \\"Leabhar Ó Dubhagáin\\" or \\"Dugan's book\\". So also John Lynch, another noted Galway 17th century scholar who wrote in both Gaelic and Latin, refers to it in his book \\"Cambronais Eversus\\" as \\"Liber Odubhegan and quotes from it on at least six occasions. The Sligo-born Dubhaltach Mac Firbhisigh, a contemporary of O'Flaherty and Lynch, used \\"Leabhar Ó Dubhagáin\\" as a source of material for his \\"Seancahs Síl Ir\\". This is fortunate, since four of the fourteen folios of the original text are now lost and the lacuna can be supplied only from Mac Firbhisigh's transcript. \\"The Annals of the Four Masters\\" record the death of Richard Ó Dubhagáin in 1379, John and Cormac in 1440. Donal Ó Dubhagáin is also recorded as having died in 1487. These people must be have been of some considerable importance for the annalist deemed it necessary to record their deaths. The O'Dugans continued to engage in their profession of \\"filí\\" and in 1750, Teigh O'Dugan compiled a pedigree of John O'Donnellan of Ballydonnellan. John O'Donovan in his book The Tribes and Customs of Hy Many refers to the old manuscripts of Teige O'Dugan, \\"an eminent historian of about 90 years ago\\". This would coincide with the aforementioned Teig. It is most likely that Teige was the last if the filí of the old order. Murchadh Riabhach O'Cuindlis, the scribe who compiled the massive text of the Leabhar breac (1408–11) and who was a native of Ballydacker near Athleague was more than likely of the same stock as the O'Dugans. Early modern The Book of Survey and Distribution for the year 1641 records the transfer of land at Ballydoogane in the parish of Fohenagh, barony of Kilconnell, from Teigh O'Doogane to Dennis O'Doogan. This shows that the O'Duggans still held on to land in their hereditary \\"tuagh\\" or country into the seventeenth century. According to Simmington's \\"Transplantations to Connacht\\", they lost their lands during the Cromwellian confiscations but in 1658, the commissioners in Loughrea regranted 75 acres to Teigh O'Doogane in the parish of Ahascragh. Griffith's Valuation shows John O'Doogan in possession of 74 acres 1 rood and 15 perches in the townland of Killasolan, parish of Ahascragh. Michael Duggan is the present owner of this land.  Later modern O'Duggan In the 19th and 20th centuries, the greatest concentration of the name Duggan is to be found in Claregalway and in the environs of Galway city. In the census of 1841, there were 43 families of Duggan listed for the townland of Móinteach (Claregalway) alone. Even after the devastation of the Great famine (1845–46), Griffith's Valuation of 1855 shows that there were still 29 Duggan households in Móinteach. There is no reliable record of how they came there but they certainly brought the tradition of the scribe and filí with them. A notable member of this Duggan clan was the Most. Rev. Patrick Duggan (1813–96), Bishop of Clonfert. Dr. Duggan was born in Cummer, Corofin, Tuam, on 10 November 1813. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1841 and appointed curate to the parish of Kilmoylan and Cummer. On the death of the parish priest Canon Cannavan, he became parish priest in charge of the parish until he was elevated to the Bishopric on 14 January 1872. The period of his priesthood in Cummer coincided with the Famine years and he was conspicuous among the clergy for his exertions in helping the sick and poor. He was a zealous supporter of the Tenant Right Movement and Home Rule. In a by-election which was called for the county in 1872, Dr. Duggan, now Bishop of Clonfert, organised support for Captain J.P. Nolan who was favourably disposed towards tenants rights. Nolan was elected but lost his seat on the grounds of undue clerical influence and Dr. Duggan was brought to trial with others before the Court of Common Pleas, but the case collapsed and he was acquitted. He died on 15 August 1896 and was buried in the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, favoured by the republican nationalists. In modern day, the name is found throughout Ireland. In the north, Dugan, Dougan, and Doogan are common, a large portion descended from families originally in County Fermanagh. Doogan is common in County Donegal. Duggan is most prevalent in Dublin, Munster, and the majority of County Cork, County Tipperary, County Wexford, and County Waterford. Use of the surname in other countries Dugan and Dougan are also common Scottish names. Throughout other English speaking countries, Dugan and its many variants, including Duggan, Dougan, Doughan, Doogan, and Duggin are widespread. Dugan ranked 1,705 in surname listings in the 1990 United States Census. Retrieved 30 August 2007 In Great Britain, Duggan ranked 1,950 in surname listings from the 1881 Census, then surged to 1,025 in surname listings from the 1996 Electoral roll.

The Maggi company was acquired by Nestlé in 1947. History Share of the Fabrik von Maggis Nahrungsmitteln, issued 1. July 1908 The company originated in Switzerland in 1884, when Julius Maggi took over his father's mill. He quickly became a pioneer of industrial food production, aiming to improve the nutritional intake of worker families. Maggi was the first to bring protein-rich legume meals to the market, and followed up with a ready-made soup based on legume meals in 1886. After that Julius Maggi introduced bouillon concentrates, first in capsules, then in cubes. In 1897, Julius Maggi founded the company Maggi GmbH in Singen, Germany. In 1947, following several changes in ownership and corporate structure, Maggi's holding company merged with the Nestlé company to form Nestlé-Alimentana S.A., currently known in its francophone home base as Nestlé S.A. Products Image:Maggiwürze-alt.jpgMaggi Seasoning sauce (replica of a historic bottle) Image:Maggiwürze-neu.jpgA bottle of Maggi sauce in 2006 Image:Brühwürfel-1.jpgBouillon cubes =Cube= The bouillon cube or Maggi cube is a meat substitute product that was introduced in 1908. In Germany, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Bénin, Gambia, Sénégal, Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania and parts of the Middle East, Maggi cubes are an integral part of the local cuisine. In Haiti and throughout Latin America, Maggi products, especially bouillon cubes, are widely sold with some repackaging to reflect local terminology. In the German, Dutch, and Danish languages, lovage has come to be known as Maggi herb (Ger. Maggikraut, Du. maggikruid or maggiplant, Da. maggiurt), because it tastes similar to Maggi sauce, although lovage is not present in the sauce. Maggi advertisement in Senegal =Seasoning sauce= In Romania, Mexico, German-speaking countries, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Poland and France, \\"Maggi\\" is still synonymous with Maggi- Würze (Maggi seasoning sauce), a dark, soy sauce-type hydrolysed vegetable protein-based condiment sauce. In Spain and Mexico, it is sold under the name Jugo Maggi. There are a total of nine different formulations, which differ between nations and/or regions. =Noodles= Boiled Maggi instant noodles with tea flavoured milk, served in India. Maggi instant noodles are popular in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and India and are synonymous with instant noodles in most of these countries. Nestle has 39% market share in Malaysia, and had 90% market share in India prior to a nationwide ban by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. Following the ban, the market share was reduced to 53% in India. In Malaysia, fried noodles made from Maggi noodles are called Maggi goreng. Maggi Instant noodles are branded as \\"Maggi 2 Minute Noodles\\" in Australia, New Zealand and India. In India, Maggi Masala noodles carry a green dot, meaning they are specifically formulated to serve vegetarians. However, Maggi chicken noodles carry a red dot, indicating that they are not vegetarian. This special formulation is not available in other countries, unless imported from India. =Recipe mixes= Recipe mixes or so called Fixes were introduced in Germany in 1974. The product offers to the consumers an idea and a recipe to cook with two or three fresh ingredients and a Maggi mix. A complete step-be-step recipe is given on the back of pack. Following the recipe guarantees the result. These products were originally launched in Germany, where they became very popular, and some Western European countries. In the 1990s, recipe mixes were introduced in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Poland (under the Winiary brand), where they became a big success. Nowadays, the portfolio of recipe mixes offer consumers more than 100 recipe ideas across different European countries. Maggi noodles safety concerns in India In May 2015, food safety regulators from Barabanki, a district of Uttar Pradesh, India reported that samples of Maggi 2 Minute Noodles had unexpectedly high levels of monosodium glutamate (MSG), as well as up to 17 times the permissible limit of lead. This finding led to multiple market withdrawals and investigations in India and beyond. = Timeline = * 3 June 2015 – The New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi in New Delhi stores for 15 days due to these findings. First Information Reports (FIRs) against Bollywood Maggi Brand Ambassadors Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit, and Preity Zinta were lodged by Sudhir Kumar Ojha, a lawyer, at Muzaffarpur district court, asking the authorities to arrest them if required. He complained that he fell sick after eating Maggi which he had purchased from a shop at Lenin Chowk on 30 May. * 4 June 2015 – The Gujarat FDA banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with objectionable levels of metallic lead, among other things, and Assam banned sale, distribution, and storage of Maggi's \\"extra delicious chicken noodles\\" variety for 30 days after tests carried out at the state public health laboratory concluded that the particular variety contained added an excessively high amount of lead. On 4 June 2015 the government of Tamil Nadu banned Maggi foods due to an unacceptable amount of lead and other components. * 5 June 2015 – The Andhra Pradesh Government also banned Maggi foods. * Also on 5 June 2015, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) ordered a recall of all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles and oats masala noodles, suggesting that they were unsafe and hazardous for human consumption. On the same day, the Food Standards Agency of the United Kingdom launched an investigation into the level of lead in Maggi noodles. * 6 June 2015 – The Central Government of India banned nationwide sales of Maggi noodles for an indefinite period. * 26 June 2015 – During a press meeting, the Minister for Health and Family Welfare of Karnataka, U. T. Khader, stated that Maggi foods would not be banned. * July, 2015 – The Bombay High Court allowed the export of Maggi while the ban in India remained. * August 2015 – Tests performed by the US health regulator FDA showed no dangerous lead levels in the products. On 13 August 2015, the nationwide ban was struck down by the Bombay high court. The court stated that proper procedure was not followed in issuing the ban and called into question the test results, as the samples were not tested at authorized laboratories accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). * January 2019 - Maggi instant noodles were again under the scanner for lead content in the noodles. Popular noodles brand has lead in it! Presence of toxin admitted during SC hearing =Additional market bans= Some of India's biggest retailers (including Future Group's Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Nilgiris) imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi. In addition, multiple state authorities in India found an unacceptable amount of lead, leading to bans in more than 5 other states. Nepal indefinitely banned Maggi over concerns about the lead levels in the product. Maggi noodles were subsequently withdrawn from the market of five African nations: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Sudan. =Testing controversies= * Monosodium glutamate (MSG): Testing found some MSG in Maggi noodles. The packet stated \\"No added MSG\\"; however, MSG naturally occurs in hydrolyzed peanut protein, onion powder, and wheat flour. Maggi offered to remove the words \\"No added MSG\\" from the package to overcome the objection. * Lead: Maggi noodles include flavouring packets named \\"Tastemaker\\" which is intended to dissolve in water during cooking. Maggi insisted that testing should be done on the product as it is eaten, however, the FSSAI insisted that the powder itself should be tested. On 5 June, the FSSAI said that the prescribed standards of 2.5 parts per million would have to apply to all components of the product. Out of the 13 samples tested by Delhi authorities, 10 of them had lead content exceeding this limit. The packets that initiated the investigation from Uttar Pradesh had 17.2 ppm of lead. Nestlé also questioned the reliability of the labs used. Results from testing outside of India (Singapore, US) reported that Maggi noodles were safe. In the later Bombay High Court judgment, the court agreed that the test results by earlier labs were unreliable. The court mandated testing to be done at three specific laboratories (Punjab, Hyderabad, and Jaipur) where Maggi was found safe. The lead may have been naturally occurring in plants and soil or from Indian spices, although within acceptable limits. =Company response= Maggi always insisted that their noodle product is safe. Maggi recalled stock worth nearly ₹320 crore (₹3.2 Billion) from the shelves and paid ₹20 crores (₹200 million) to a cement factory to burn the product. In addition, the Corporate Affairs Ministry of India imposed a ₹640 crore (₹6.4 Billion) fine on Nestle India for the presence of MSG and lead beyond the permissible limit. =Return to market= In India, Maggi products were returned to the shelves in November 2015,Bhusan, Ratna and Malviya, Sagar (17 October 2015) http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons- products/food/maggi-clears-all-tests-nestle-india-to-restart-production- within-2-3-weeks/articleshow/49423524.cms accompanied by a Nestlé advertising campaign to win back the trust of members of the Indian community. At this time, the \\"Maggi anthem\\" by Vir Das and Alien Chutney became popular. Nestlé resumed production of Maggi at all five plants in India on 30 November 2015. Criticism Nestlé has faced criticism of its advertising not adhering to marketing regulations in developed countries, and for making misleading claims in developing countries. In October 2008, Nestlé aired a commercial meant for Bangladeshi television on British TV. The advert made false claims that the noodles would \\"help to build strong muscles, bone, and hair\\". The British Advertising Standards Authority stated that the advertisement did not abide by the new EU consumer protection legislation, by which advertisers have to provide proof of health claims.

A small British force, led by Captain James Outram, were attacked by the Talpurs and forced to make a fort of the British residence, which they successfully defended until they finally escaped to a waiting river steamer. After the British victory at Meeanee (also spelt Miani), Charles Napier continued his advance to the Indus River and attacked the Sindh capital of Hyderabad. Hyderabad was defended by 20,000 troops and baloch tribes under the command of His Highness Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur \\"Sher-i-Sindh\\" and Hosh Mohammad sheedi. Charles Napier with a force of only 3,000 men but with artillery support stormed the city. During the battle Hosh Mohammad sheedi was killed and his forces routed; Talpurs resistance collapsed and Sindh came under British rule. Prelude The British East India company became involved in the region of Sindh in Pakistan (at that time India), under the authority of Lord Ellenborough. In 1809, The Amirs of Sindh signed a treaty of \\"friendship\\" with the British, who established a local representative in the city of Hyderabad. With this arrival of British influence within the region, the Amirs of the Sindh lessened their internal struggles and turned instead to face this foreign presence.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 111. In 1838, the British representative had the Amirs sign a political residency treaty, allowing a British residency in the city of Hyderabad, which paved the way for further British involvement in the area. This same treaty also stipulated that the British would assist in negotiating the differences held between the rulers of the Sindh and those of the Punjab.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 113. Soon after, this would be taken a step further in the signing of a treaty pushed by the British that if needed British troops would be stationed permanently in the Sindh region for ‘the protection of the Amirs’. The Amirs however would have to pay for a British resident in Hyderabad, who would negotiate all relations between the British and the Amirs.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 112. The British maintained various policies among the different Amirs, so as to please each individual and divide them by dealing with them separately. Captain James Outram was initially in charge of these dealings, and he made significant progress with the Amirs, who began confiding in him. As a result, Outram was able to attain power over the Amirs’ foreign policy as well as to station his troops in the province. Tensions began to rise when the British, who were involved in the politics in Afghanistan at the time, started interfering in the internal affairs of the Amirs as well as asking them for land which the British desired. The British were supporting Shah Shujah Durrani to take the throne in Afghanistan.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 114. The Amirs, however, resented this proposal, which added to their discontentment with the British occupations. The Amirs refused to aid Shah Shujah in Afghanistan and, siding more with the Shah of Persia, angered the British.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 120. These relations took a turn for the worse when allegations were made of the Amirs communicating with the Shah of Persia, a rival of Shah Shujah and the British. It was after this incident that the British made it clear to the Amirs of the Sindh that any further cooperation with any people other than the British would lead to their destruction and their loss of rule in the Sindh. The distrust between the British and the Amirs of the Sindh continued to worsen, as both sides grew more and more suspicious of each other. Both sides continued on, feigning normality while both were aware of the other's mistrust.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 116. As a result of their distrust, the British began to keep a close eye on Noor Mohammed Khan, one of the most prominent Amirs, at his residence in Hyderabad.Wallis, A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849, p. 118. In 1841, the British appointed Charles Napier for service in India at the age of 59. The following year Napier arrived in Bombay on 26 August. Upon his arrival he was told of the situation that existed between the British and the Amirs, and that the Amirs were making trouble for the British. On 10 September 1842 Napier arrived in the Sindh.Duarte, A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843, p. 403–404. Under Napier, British control saw some charity on their occupation of Sindh and the territory of the Amirs. There was a belief that the British were, in fact, improving life for many in the area, as they saw the Amirs as overly wealthy rulers over a poor people.Duarte,A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843, p. 405. Napier was also very much of a mind to expand and tighten British control. Previously Outram had been in charge of negotiations between the British and the Amirs and had been very lenient towards the Amirs, which they appreciated greatly. Napier, on the other hand, not only longed for campaign, but was also very authoritarian with regard to the British rule in the area, and wanted to see full control by the British.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 567. Napier himself was charged by Ellenborough to look into the matter of the Amirs’ duplicity, to find evidence of their suspicious behaviour, and to compile it into a report which he would submit to Ellenborough.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 565. However, due to the fact that Napier was fresh to the Sindh and knew none of the language which would allow him to understand the pieces of alleged evidence against the Amirs, he was left with a difficult task.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 565-566. Napier's 200-page report was submitted to Ellenborough, who received the it on November 3. The report was fairly inaccurate in its information about the Amirs, and Ellenborough sent his reply the day after as well as draft of a new treaty to be made with the Amirs.Duarte, A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843, p. 408. The speed of the reply, as well as the fact that it was accompanied by a drafted treaty, would indicate that Ellenborough had made his decision and the draft even before receiving Napier's report.Duarte, A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843, p. 409. Ellenborough's reply urged Napier to find convicting evidence of the actions of the Amirs - of which he had fairly little. His most incriminating piece of evidence was a letter supposedly written by the Amir, but which might easily have been a forgery, of which Napier was aware. As a result, Napier wrote to Ellenborough again, telling him of the small pieces of evidence that he had and asked for Ellenborough's help in the situation. However, Ellenborough replied saying that he agreed with the verdict made by Napier - though he had not concretely stated one.Duarte, A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843, p. 411. Conflict In February 1843, Amir Sodbar resided at Hyderabad Fort. While Sodbar was cooperative with the British, Napier was wary of him, and felt Sodbar was too much of a liability for the British, though the Amir was unaware of these feelings.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 150–151. As a result, when Napier asked Sodbar to send away Talpurs troops from the Fort, Amir Sodbar complied. Napier then took control of the fort himself, raising the British flag and stationing troops there. At first Napier was hesitant to hold Sodbar prisoner. However, after some of Sodbar's men resisted the British, against Sodbar's will, Napier decided to hold the Amir as a prisoner in Hyderabad Fort.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 152. Ellenborough gave orders for all treasure and articles of wealth to be seized from the Amir's residence in Hyderabad, except that which the women chose to retain as their own jewelry or possessions. Collection agents were appointed to mediate the confiscation of the wealth. Some of the women made good use of this opportunity to take large amounts of wealth with them, while others, fearful of the British appointees, gave up much of their possessions.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 154–155. Around this time, Napier heard word of one of the Amirs, Sher Mohammad, mustering troops to resist the British forces. Napier was under the impression that Sher Mohammad would offer little resistance as he had very little funds or weapons, and was therefore surprised to hear that he had almost 30,000 troops ready to be brought against the British.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 156. Upon hearing of Sher Mohammad's foreboding army, Napier immediately sent for reinforcements to be sent from Ferozepur and Sukkur. Around the same time, Talpur soldiers began to attack British supply routes along the Indus as well as those from Karachi to other British holdings.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 157–158. It was Napier's intent to hold off battle as long as he could so as to get the most reinforcements that he could manage. He was sent a message from Sher Mohammad, promising the safety of Napier and his men if he would give up the fort and the confiscated wealth. In reply, Napier fired cannons from the fort as a sign that he would not surrender. On 20 March, Sir Charles Napier went out to reconnotire Sher Mohammad's position near Tando Ali Jam, finding the Amir's army to be strong and holding excellent territory for defense. The next day, Napier received much needed reinforcements who arrived by ship, coming down the Indus from Sukkur.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 159–160. Battle A British map of the battle On 24 March 1843 British troops, led by Sir Charles Napier, set out from Hyderabad to meet Sher Mohammad. After marching for some time, the British forces came upon the Amir's army.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 161. While waiting for the rest of the British army, the Scinde Horse, one of Napier's cavalry regiments, began to position themselves in a line opposite the Talpurs troops, who began to fire on the regiment. Napier himself had to do much of the positioning of the troops, as he lacked experienced commanders within his regiments. As each regiment made its way to the battle, and into position, the fighting grew fierce between both sides. The Talpur troops were well entrenched in their position and, due to the terrain, Napier was unable to get an idea of just how far the Talpur line was and how well it was supported. Soon the British had brought up artillery as well, which opened fire on the Talpur troops in their trenches. As the British approached the left side of Talpur forces, they found themselves faced with heavy attack from the trees, where a large number of troops had positioned themselves.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 163. After almost an hour of fire between both sides, Napier began to see an opportunity to break through a weak spot in the Amir's lines. The Scinde Horse and 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry made a move to attack the left wing of the British troops and crashed into the Talpur before they could do significant damage. Meanwhile, on the right wing British soldiers charged the Talpur lines, piling over their trenches where the tightly packed Talpur's found difficulty in using their swords against the British. Seeing the desperation of the Talpur plight Amir Sher Mohammad left the battle at the suggestion of his commander, Hosh Mohammad Kambrani (Also called Hosh Muhammad Shidi), with hopes that he might obtain another chance at victory over the British. Hosh Muhammad, on the other hand, stayed behind with the troops, fighting the British to the death.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 164–165. British troops charge the Talpur lines (from a British book) The British troops, seeing the centre of the Talpur line giving way, charged through the middle, dividing the Amir's line. About this time, Napier was almost killed when a magazine exploded near by, killing some British soldiers near him, but sparing his life.Lambrick, Sir Charles Napier and Sind, p. 166. One of Napier's commanders, after breaking through the Talpurs left wing then left the field, perhaps aiding later in cutting off the Talpurs retreat. The Amir's men, routed and disorganized, began to flee, and Napier with the Bengal Cavalry pressed on after them, cutting them off from escaping across the Indus. This strategic move on the part of the British stopped the Talpurs from regrouping with others and posing a threat to the British. With the Talpurs dispersed, Napier returned to his men who celebrated their victor with three cheers. This battle would be one of the last major efforts by Sher Mohammad to resist against the British, which ended on 14 June when British troops surprised the Amir and captured three of his cannons. Sher Mohammad himself escaped to Afghanistan.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 574–575. Aftermath Following the British victory, and consequent annexation of the Sindh, troubles quickly arose. Captain James Outram, who had been sent back to England following his posting in the Sindh, began to plead the case of the Amirs in England. Coupled with the new victory, stark criticism arose in England towards both Ellenborough and Napier, who wrote, pleading their own case and arguing over the details of their dealings with the Amirs.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 575. The authorities in England were not pleased with the annexation of the Sindh, and had in mind to restore the territory to the Amirs. However, thinking that the process of returning the Sindh to its original owners would be difficult and that the forced resignation of Ellenborough and Napier would cause further criticism from England, the ownerships of the Sindh would remain with the British. The government in England did write to Napier and Ellenbourough, condemning the annexation and their actions. The actual province of Sindh was not as prosperous as Napier had hoped after capture, and for many years the British gained very little from its possession.Moon, The British Conquest and Dominion of India, p. 576. =EIC Casualties= Hyderabad War Memorial The Hyderabad war memorial details 39 EIC casualties suffered during the battle, naming: * Lt.

Prior to that he served as Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Bat Yam and Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Haifa. Bakshi-Doron was criticized by Haredi leaders for some of his halakhic (Jewish legal) decisions, and by the Reform movement for his position on assimilation. He was known for his promotion of interfaith dialogue and nonviolence.  Early life and education Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron was born in Jerusalem to Ben- Zion Bakshi-Doron, a native of the city, and Tova, an immigrant from Aleppo, Syria. He had two brothers and a sister. As a young man, Eliyahu studied in several prominent yeshivas of the Religious Zionist movement. He continued his education at Yeshivat HaDarom, Hebron Yeshiva, and Kol Ya'akov. During this time he began to think of a rabbinic career, and established relationships with leading halakhic figures Rabbis Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Betzalel Zolty, and Ovadia Yosef. Rabbinic career After his marriage at age 25, Bakshi- Doron was tapped to lead the upper class in Porat Yosef Yeshiva. At age 28 he was appointed Rav of the Ramat Hanasi neighborhood of Bat Yam, becoming the youngest Rav of an Israeli city. Two years after that he was named Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Bat Yam. In 1973, at the age of 34, he was appointed Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Haifa. At the same time he was also named head of the rabbinical courts in the city, which supervised the kashrut of many large, local food factories. Throughout this time he gave public shiurim (Torah lectures) to strengthen the Sephardic community. = Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel = In 1993, Bakshi-Doron became the first Rishon LeZion (Chief Rabbi of Israel) of non-Iraqi extraction since Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel in 1954. He served his term concurrently with his Ashkenazi counterpart, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau. In a 1996 sermon, Bakshi-Doron compared Reform Judaism to the biblical Zimri, who was killed by Phinehas for cohabitation with a Midianite woman. Bakshi-Doron dismissed the resulting uproar as a publicity stunt, saying it was \\"unthinkable\\" that anyone would consider his speech an incitement to murder. In January 1999, Bakshi-Doron stated publicly that the Reform movement had harmed Jews more than had the Holocaust. According to Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer, in other countries, his statement might be considered criminal incitement and antisemitism. In 1998, Bakshi-Doron met with Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen in Istanbul, Turkey.Myre, Greg (2016-07-16) \\"Why Is A Cleric In The Poconos Accused Of Fomenting Turkeys Coup Attempt\\", NPR In 2000, Bakshi-Doron and Lau made headlines when they met with Pope John Paul II.Myre, Greg (2014-05-24) \\"Popes In The Holy Land After 2000 Years A New Tradition\\", NPR It was later seen as a historical precedent which led the way to the 2005 meeting between Chief Rabbis Shlomo Amar and Yona Metzger with the new Pope, Benedict XVI. In 2000, while visiting the Jewish community in Singapore, Bakshi-Doron declared that he was in favor of giving away parts of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as a way towards ending the Arab–Israeli conflict. He stipulated that any agreement would have to allow for the Temple Mount to remain in Israeli control.  Shmita controversy  In the sabbatical year of 2000, Bakshi-Doron became involved in a disagreement with some of the leading rabbis in Israel. In order to get around the Jewish legal prohibitions of shmita, in which farmland must lie fallow once every seven years, some Sephardi and Religious Zionist rabbis had allowed the use of the Heter Mechira (land-sale contract), by which farmers could symbolically sell their land to non-Jews for the sabbatical year, thereby permitting them to continue farming. The permits came under fire by Haredi rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Bakshi-Doron and Lau, with the support of former Rishon LeZion Ovadia Yosef, ruled that the permits were valid. When Bakshi- Doron publicly told the farmers that they could rely on the sales, the Haredi newspaper Yated Ne'eman began to leak word that Eliashiv would delegitimize him and put him and his family in herem (ex-communication) if he refused to back down. Distraught, Bakshi-Doron went to meet with President of Israel Moshe Katsav, reportedly bursting into tears. Despite the open support of Katsav and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Bakshi-Doron ultimately succumbed to the pressure from Eliashiv. This was widely seen by the National Religious camp as surrender to the Haredim.  Outreach  On January 21, 2002, Bakshi-Doron took part in an interfaith conference in Alexandria, Egypt. Among those present at the conference were the former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, Rabbi Michael Melchior, the muftis of Bethlehem, and the Palestinian Authority police forces. The attendees issued a joint agreement called the First Declaration of Alexandria of the Religious Leaders of the Holy Land, in which they denounced the ongoing violence in the Middle East. Although the accord received the support of both Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat, it had little perceivable effect. Bakshi-Doron continued to participate in interfaith activities and sat on the Board of World Religious Leaders for The Elijah Interfaith Institute. Later in 2002, Bakshi-Doron accused Yasser Arafat of attempting to commit \\"a Holocaust against the State of Israel\\".http://www.unitedjerusalem.org/index2.asp?id=87831&Date;=4/1/2002 Later positions In 2004, Bakshi-Doron spoke out in favor of introducing civil marriage in Israel, saying that the law subjecting members of the different Millets to respective religious authorities had become irrelevant, and was now a source of division and hatred.Israel Middle East Survey Finds Support For Civil Marriage Among Observant Israeli Jews, JTA Bakshi-Doron received attention in January 2005 for attending the first World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for Peace in Brussels, Belgium. The Congress was made up of some 180 notable Jewish and Muslim religious representatives, authorities, and scholars from all over the world. They released a statement calling for the promotion of peace and understanding between Jews and Muslims. In August 2005, Bakshi-Doron, along with Modern Orthodox rabbis Norman Lamm and Aharon Lichtenstein, condemned calls by other prominent rabbis for Israeli Defense Forces soldiers to disobey their orders to dismantle Jewish settlements as part of the Gaza Disengagement. Bakshi-Doron's 1993 ruling that \\"Women can be of the Gedolim (great leaders) of the generation and serve as halakhic decisors\\" attracted attention in light of the controversy over the appointments of women to clerical positions in Orthodox congregations.Responsa Binyan Av, 65:5. But in a letter to the Rabbinical Council of America, dated June 23, 2015, Bakshi-Doron clarified his opinion that women could not take up official positions.Gordimer, Avraham (2015-11-11) Woman Rabbis And The Bakshi Doron Letter: Time For A Fact Check, Israel National News  Binyan Av institutions Following his term as Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, Bakshi- Doron continued his teaching and work as a halakhic arbiter. He also established the Binyan Av institutions, which include a central campus in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of Jerusalem.  Conviction  Bakshi-Doron was indicted in 2012 over his involvement in \\"the rabbis’ case,\\" in which he was accused of issuing false rabbinic ordinations and yeshiva education certificates to 1,500 police and security services employees during his tenure as Chief Rabbi. The ordinations, equivalent to a higher education on Israel's public employees' salary scale, entitled recipients to bonuses of NIS2,000–4,000, then valued at an additional $530–$1,060 per month. As a result, the government paid out hundreds of millions of shekels without justification. Bakshi-Doron was convicted of fraud and breach of trust on May 15, 2017, by the Jerusalem District Court for his part in the scam. He was sentenced to one year probation, and a fine of NIS 250,000.

The Austrians were led by Julius Jacob von Haynau, while the Hungarians were led by Józef Bem who arrived at the eleventh hour from Transylvania. The Austrians were victorious. The Hungarians had only their southern division here, and although they had slightly more men than the Austrians, they lacked experience and good equipment. Henryk Dembiński, the leader of this Hungarian division, retreated from Szeged just before the arrival of the army of Julius Jacob von Haynau, where the Hungarians had prepared defence lines. Dembiński was relieved of his command, and Lajos Kossuth asked József Bem to step in. The Hungarians were stationed at the stronghold of Temesvár (now Timișoara, Romania) when they were attacked from Temesvár Castle too. The Hungarians did well for a while, but when Bem fell from his horse they could not hold the Austrian cavalry. Pretext Henryk Dembiński, the originator of the idea to join forces at Szeged, became the supreme commander of the southern Hungarian army, even though Antal Vetter had a chance of getting this post. Dembiński commanded little respect because he retreated in 1831 and it seemed that he could not change. He essentially retreated from Szeged and left a legion with only four cannon at Újszeged. He was supreme commander of the Hungarian army at the Battle of Kápolna and the Battle of Szőreg, and lost both. Henryk Dembiński, who was also supreme commander of the Hungarian army at the Battle of Kápolna and the Battle of Szőreg. He lost both. The Hungarian army left their positions, because they could push the Austrian army, which was crossing Újszeged, towards the River Tisza,Vilmos Lázár was begging Dembiński to make this move. but it didn't happen. Even though the Hungarians were defending their positions, Haynau crossed the Tisza to Újszeged without resistance. Dembiński stationed his army between Maros and Szőreg and Haynau started to move towards the Hungarian army. Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere There was a small chance the Hungarian army could win if the Austrian army sent its cavalry against the Hungarian artillery or if Dembiński attacked the Austrian foot. But Dembiński was inactive even though the Hungarian cavalry defeated the Austrian cavalry's attacks and the Hungarian artillery defended their positions too. After the Hungarian army lost the Battle of Szőreg, Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere gave orders to Dembiński to retreat towards Arad (now in Romania) because they wanted him to fight there. That position had many advantages: * The River Maros () formed a natural defense line * The castle of Arad was controlled by the Hungarian revolutionary army * Other Hungarian legions close bymainly Görgei's Upper-Danube legion and other legions too, except Károly Vécsey's 5th legion and György Kmety's legion. Because the 5th legion was attacking Temesvár, they could not move forces from there to help. * The Hungarian population was in majority in that area Dembiński retreated to Temesvár while the Italian legion, under the command of Monti Alessandro, helped the Hungarian army's retreat. The Hungarians were tired and had low morale when they arrived at Temesvár on 9 August. József Bem was at Temesvár when they arrived, and he became the new supreme commander of the Hungarian army. Battle =Fight for better position= József Bem, Hungarian supreme commander in the Battle of Temesvár Hungarian plan The position of the Hungarian army was unfortunate. At Kisbecskerek (now Becicherecu Mic, Romania) there were some cavalry and 4 cannon against the Austrian army. Kmety's legion's became the left flank at Szakálháza, on the northern east was Colonel László Gál’s 10th legion, Major-general Richard Guyon with his 4th legion was in the centrum and Major-general Arisztid Dessewffy’s 9th legion was the left flank. Most of the centrum and left flank were stationed in the Csóka and Vadász forests. Vécsey's 5 th legion surrounded Temesvár. From this legion most of the foot joined in Guyon's legion because of Bem's order. The Hungarian army could not retreat towards Temesvár because the Austrian army was defending the way to the city. Austrian plan Haynau in the Battle of Temesvár Haynau didn't expect any fight on this day and wanted to move his legion to Kisbecskerek. Franz Schlik and his first legion had to advance to Vinga (now in Romania) to block the Arad-Temesvár route. Franz Liechtenstein and his legion had to occupy Hodony and Mercyfalva (now Sânandrei, Romania). Georg Heinrich Ramberg and his 3rd legion had to occupy Kisbecskerek and Szakálháza. Ludwig von Wallmoden- Gimborn and his cavalry had to advance towards Temesvár and Fjodor Szergejevics Panutyin's 9th Russian legion had to occupy Kisbecskerek too. =The fight= The Wallmoden legion bumped into the Hungarian rearguard around 8.30 am. After a short cannon fight the Hungarians had to retreat in the direction of River Nyárád. After a short while the 3rd legion arrived to Kisbecskerek. Haynau with the Russian legion and artillery also arrived Kisbecskerek and ordered his legions to advance towards the Hungarians and attack them. Franz Schlick commander of the 1st legion After that Haynau saw the Hungarians army was advancing towards his legion, he gave the order to attack the Hungarians: he sent 12 cannon. Bem ordered six cavalry troops and one cannon to attack Haynau. It was successful and the Austrians had to retreat. Furthermore, Haynau's legion mixed up the advancing Russian army. Haynau attacked back with fourteen cavalry troops and sent an order to Liechtenstein that he had to advance to Szentandrás (now Sânandrei, in Romania) and attack the right Hungarian flank. Bem's artillery was too enthusiastic and used up their munitions quickly. When he sent for more munitions, Bem did not know that Dembiński moved the spare munitions to Lugos (now Lugoj, Romania), so Bem gave the order to Kmety to move forward on the left flank. Kmety sent his cavalry against the Austrians but they defended themselves. Another Hungarian troop surrounded the Austrians and made them to retreat. the Battle of Temesvár At this time there were 120 Hungarian cannon and 108 Austrian cannon. The great cannon fight stopped immediately after a while because the Hungarians didn't have more munitions. Haynau realized this and ordered the Austrians to move forward in the hope that Liechtenstein's reinforcement would arrive soon. This happened around 5 pm but it was not the same how Haynau had imagined because Liechtenstein's army was divided and arrived from two directions. Liechtenstein's army started attack the Hungarians from the front and the side. The Hungarian army had to retreat in the direction of the River Nyárád. General Mór Perczel tried to help to the Hungarians and sent his 9th legion to Újbesenyő (now Dudeștii Noi, Romania). But because no one wanted to command this legion they also retreated to Nyárád. =Unfavourable turn= György Kmety, Károly Brocky’s oil painting Bem ordered Kmety to advance while he went to the right flank. But he fell off his horse and got injured and it meant that there were no one who could conduct the whole Hungarian army. Dessewffy tried to stop Liechtenstein with his troops and 3 cannon, but the Austrian army was stronger and the 4th and 9th legions started to retreat. Dessewffy had to retreat too, to avoid the Austrian army cutting him off. The Austrian army pursued the Hungarians. =Retreat= Mór Perczel, Hungarian general Perczel then arrived at the Hungarian rearguard to attack the pursuing Austrian army. They started to fire at the Austrian army, who returned fire more strongly, and the Hungarians started to panic. There were about 30,000 men who said they would desert after the first gunshot. The 9th Hungarian legion shrank from 16,000 men to 7,000. Haynau captured about 6,000 to 7,000 men, the largest number of captives since the Winter Campaign. Aftermath There was no longer any chance the Hungarians could win the revolution, and after the defeat it became obvious that the Hungarians could gain no advantage from their capitulation. Every other Hungarian attempt to win a battle was unsuccessful. The battle was the last major one in the Hungarian Revolution. During the retreat the Hungarian army broke up and just only half of it arrived at Lugos. Haynau left Temesvár. After the battle it was impossible to continue the revolution and the Hungarians formally declared their surrender at Világos (now Șiria, Romania).

They were identical twins and were also known as the Twin Foxes. They were born in 1857 in Symonds Green and named after the Ebenezer Chapel (Baptist Church) on Albert Street, of which their father, Henry Fox, was a devout supporter. Their mother, Charlotte Fox, was a straw-plait worker and their father farmed of land. Despite their respectable background, the twins turned to a life of crime. They made sure never to go poaching together, and often escaped their frequent encounters with the constabulary by providing alibis for each other. Despite this, they did spend time in prison where they attracted the attention of Sir Edward Henry who used twins, including the Foxes, to prove that an individual could be identified by his fingerprints. Their crimes made national and international news. Both twins ended their days in Chalkdell House (the Poor Law Union workhouse) in Hitchin.

The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004) is a treatise by political scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington (1927–2008). The book attempts to understand the nature of American identity and the challenges it will face in the future. Describing American identity In describing the American identity, Huntington first contests the notion that the country is, as often repeated, \\"a nation of immigrants\\". He writes that America's founders were not immigrants, but settlers, since British settlers came to North America to establish a new society, as opposed to migrating from one existing society to another one as immigrants do. Later peoples who joined the culture present in the original British colonies, already established by these settlers, were indeed immigrants. Many people point to the American Creed as the core of American identity. Huntington defines the American Creed as embodying the \\"principles of liberty, equality, individualism, representative government, and private property\\"., p. 41 Yet Huntington asks: > Would America be the America it is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries > it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or > Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be > Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil.Who Are We?, p. 59 Huntington argues that, of all the nations in Europe, and of all the colonies, America alone developed the American Creed, and that this simple observation requires explanation. This observation leads to two conclusions: that America was an English colony, and that America alone was formed as a result of the Reformation. To advance his argument about the contribution to America of its English heritage, he says: As for the importance of Protestantism, Huntington states: \\"The American Creed is the unique creation of a dissenting Protestant culture\\". In particular, he highlights the: Challenges to American identity Huntington argues that it is during the 1960s that American identity begins to erode. This was the result of several factors: *The beginning of economic globalization and the rise of global subnational identities *The easing of the Cold War and its end in 1989 reduced the importance of national identity *Attempts by candidates for political offices to win over groups of voters *The desire of subnational group leaders to enhance the status of their respective groups and their personal status within them *The interpretation of Congressional acts that led to their execution in expedient ways, but not necessarily in the ways the framers intended *The passing on of feelings of sympathy and guilt for past actions as encouraged by academic elites and intellectuals *The changes in views of race and ethnicity as promoted by civil rights and immigration laws Huntington places the passage and subsequent misinterpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 at the center of government actions that eroded the American Creed. Huntington writes: > Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor manager of the bill, assured the Senate > that nothing in the bill gave courts or executive agencies the power \\"to > require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order to meet a racial > 'quota' or to achieve a certain balance...Title VII prohibits > discrimination...[and] is designed to encourage hiring on the basis of > ability and qualifications, not race or religion.Who Are We?, p. 147 Yet these acts gave rise to a system of quotas and affirmative action, so that \\"the Court derived from Title VII a legal requirement that the proponents of the law had expressly disclaimed\\"., pp. 214-216 Another component of American identity that Huntington sees as under attack is the use of English. Up until the late 20th century, English has been the dominant language of America and was actively taught to immigrants. This was not only because Americans throughout history had spoken this language, but also because, with a variety of languages brought by different immigrant groups to the United States, teaching everyone to learn to speak and write English ensured communication among these groups. This tradition was inadvertently undermined by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of \\"national origin\\". The act was interpreted to mean that potential voters who did not speak English were entitled to assistance under this \\"national origin\\" clause so that they would not be disadvantaged. This led to bilingual voting ballots and the beginning of bilingual education. In 1974, the Civil Rights Act \\"was amended to require schools to provide instruction in a student's native language and culture 'to the extent necessary to allow the child to progress effectively through the education system. However, Huntington states that the result was, as stated by 1985 Secretary of Education William Bennett, that the program became: > a way of enhancing students' knowledge of their native language and culture. > Bilingual education was no longer seen so much as a means to ensure that > students learned English, or as a transitional method until students learned > English. Rather, it became an emblem of cultural pride, a means of producing > a positive self-image in the student.Who Are We?, p. 164 Finally, the single most imposing challenge to America, in Huntington's view, is the problem of Mexican immigration and the resulting \\"Hispanization\\" of those regions of the United States adjacent to and acquired from Mexico. He fears that the result of Mexican immigration could be a \\"bifurcated\\" America. Huntington argues that Mexican immigration differs from previous waves of immigration in several fundamental ways, including: *Contiguity: America is the only First World country in the world sharing a long, undefended border with a Third World country, making the crossing both easy and appealing to Mexicans.Who Are We?, p. 222 *Numbers: In the 1990s, Mexican immigration accounted for 25% of all legal immigration, much larger than the influx of Irish or German immigrants earlier in American history.Who Are We?, p. 223 *Illegality: Roughly 8–10 million illegal immigrants were in the United States by 2003, 58% of which were Mexican.Who Are We?, p. 225 *Regional concentration: \\"In 2000, nearly two thirds of Mexican immigrants lived in the West, and nearly half in California\\".Who Are We?, p. 226 *Persistence: It is estimated that nearly half a million Mexicans will immigrate to the United States each year until 2030, culminating in nearly a half century of high immigration from a single country.Who Are We?, p. 228 *Historical presence: \\"No other immigrant group in American history has asserted or has been able to assert a historical claim to American territory. Mexicans and Mexican- Americans can and do make that claim\\".Who Are We?, p. 229 Not only does Mexican immigration differ from previous immigration in these ways, but Huntington argues that Mexicans lag other immigrants in their assimilation into American society for several reasons, including: *Language: Different from other immigrants, Hispanic immigrants emphasize the need for their children to be fluent in Spanish. *Education: Mexicans were less likely to graduate high school and attend college than other immigrant groups.Who Are We?, p. 234 *Occupation and income: Mexican immigrants were far less likely to hold professional or managerial positions, and had low rates of self- employment and entrepreneurship. This parallels their educational attainment. Mexican immigrants were also more likely to live in poverty and to be on welfare than any other ethnic group, except Dominicans.Who Are We?, p. 235 *Citizenship: The rate of naturalization of Mexican immigrants was among the lowest of all immigrant groups. At least part of this may be attributable to the influence of illegal immigration. *Intermarriage: Rates of Hispanic intermarriage are roughly equivalent to that of other immigrant groups. *Identity: Mexican immigrants and their children generally refer to themselves as Mexican first and American second. However, approximately one quarter of Hispanics convert to Protestantism, a fact that Huntington attributes to assimilation of American culture, as many Hispanics come from a Catholic tradition.Who Are We?, p. 241 Huntington argues that these differences are the result of cultural differences between American Anglo Protestant culture and Hispanic \\"culture of Catholicism\\". Lionel Sosa, a Texas Mexican-American businessman, summarizes these differences as \\"mistrust of people outside the family; lack of initiative, self-reliance, and ambition; low priority for education; acceptance of poverty as a virtue necessary for entrance into heaven\\".Who Are We?, p. 254 Huntington argues that this persistent pattern of a massive influx of immigrants from Latin America, especially Mexico, has already resulted in changes in culture, business, language, and education in the Southwestern United States. If the trend continues, this could result in the consolidation of this part of the country into a distinct cultural bloc within the United States that threatens to bifurcate America. Finally, Huntington lists other ways in which America's identity has weakened. These include: the collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States without an enemy against which to define itself; the denationalization of business, professional, intellectual, and academic elites; and the influence of diasporas. By \\"denationalization\\", Huntington means that these Americans think of themselves mostly as members of an international community and not really as citizens of the United States. Renewing American identity After laying out the concerns for the weakening and subsequent dissolution of America, which could plausibly occur due to cultural bifurcation and/or a government formed of denationalized elites that increasingly ignore the will of the public, Huntington attempts to formulate a solution to these problems. He argues that adherence to the American Creed is by itself not enough to sustain an American identity. An example of a state that attempted to use ideology alone was the Soviet Union, which attempted to impose communism on different cultures and nationalities, and eventually collapsed. A similar fate could lie in store for the United States unless Americans \\"participate in American life, learn America's language [English], history, and customs, absorb America's Anglo-Protestant culture, and identify primarily with America rather than with their country of birth\\".Who Are We?, p. 339 In particular, Huntington suggests that Americans turn to Protestantism, and recognize that what distinguishes America from other countries is that it is an extremely religious Western country, founded on the principles of the Enlightenment and Protestant Reformation.  Reception  On the year of the book's release, Alan Wolfe of Foreign Affairs wrote, \\"to claim that there exists a common 'Anglo-Protestant culture...' ignores the fact that Protestants have disagreed vehemently with each other over what that culture is.\\" He furthermore argued that \\"Huntington fails to appreciate the degree to which immigrants shaped American culture even as they assimilated\\" and that the liberal elites he criticizes \\"include disproportionately large numbers of the Anglo-Protestants whose culture Huntington wants to celebrate.\\" Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times further criticized it as \\"recycling arguments made by a wide array of earlier thinkers... while glossing masses of research with decidedly subjective analysis\\" and as \\"riddled with gross generalizations... and equally questionable assertions\\" As the 2013 Washington Post article by Dylan Matthews challenged Huntington's points, arguing that Latino immigrants have been adapting to English just as quickly as Asian and European immigrants have as of 2000, that proficiency in English and support for English as the official language of the United States among Latino Americans increased over generational status, and that Hispanic Americans are no less religious or hard-working than white Americans are. In 2017, Washington Post book critic Carlos Lozada penned an editorial describing Huntington's works as \\"[anticipating] America's political and intellectual battles -- and [pointing] to the country we may become.\\" He states that Huntington \\"captures the dissonance between working classes and elites, between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, that played out in the 2016 campaign.\\" He also comments that Huntington's expressed in Clash of Civilizations and Who Are We? contrast sharply with those he expressed in his 1981 work American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony, wherein Huntington argues that Americans are primarily united by a classically liberal creed rather than \\"ethnic identity or religious faith.\\" Lozada goes on to challenge criticism of Huntington's ideas as \\"single-minded,\\" stating that \\"Huntington foresees an America roiled by self-doubt, white nationalism and enmity against Islam.\\" However, he concedes that Huntington offers a \\"narrow view of American uniqueness,\\" ultimately warning against isolationism, \\"demonizing newcomers and demanding cultural fealty.\\" References External links *Booknotes interview with Huntington on Who Are We?, June 13, 2004 * Sam Huntington discusses \\"Who Are We?

When an MLOCR does not recognize a valid address on a letter, (usually due to hand-written addressing) it sends an image of the mailpiece to a central RBCS (RVE) site where more sophisticated optical character recognition software is able to interpret many hand-written addresses using neural net and fuzzy logic algorithms. If this does not succeed, human operators visually examine the image and enter the address. In both cases, the data is sent back to the originating mail facility where mailpieces are then automatically matched back up with data through the use of a unique fluorescent barcode printed on the back during initial MLOCR attempt, and receive a POSTNET barcode representing the full address. The Remote Bar Coding System consists of hundreds of MLOCR machines, which capture an image of mailpieces throughout the USPS network, the communications hardware and software that transmit this data to the \\"remote\\" site, the specialized hardware and software that initially attempt to interpret the image, and the terminals and human operators that encode the most difficult images. The algorithms in this system are continually improved by incorporating the results of human operators. Furthermore, successive generations of MLOCR hardware and software would incorporate some of the advances made in computer- based Remote Encoding, in order to minimize the number of mailpieces that need to go through this extra step.

Despite the opposition of the Left faction, the Australian Labor Party National Executive voted narrowly to support the base. *21 March – At the conference, Arthur Calwell and Gough Whitlam were photographed outside the venue at Kingston in Canberra. Although Calwell was the Leader of the Opposition, neither man was a member of the federal executive. Menzies jibed that the ALP was ruled by \\"36 faceless men\\". * 14 August – Yolngu people petitioned the Australian House of Representatives with a bark petition after the government sold part of the Arnhem Land reserve on 13 March to a bauxite mining company. The government did not consult the traditional owners. When bauxite mining at Nhulunbuy near Yirrkala went ahead, the Yolngu took their case against the mining company to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Despite their claim not being upheld in the 1971 court decision, non- indigenous Australians were alerted to the need for indigenous representation in such decisions, and a permanent parliamentary standing committee was created to scrutinise developments at Yirrkala, among other initiatives related to the indigenous people's moral right to their lands. * 1 November – Indigenous Australians could vote in federal elections on the same basis as other electors when an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act became law. The November 1963 election was the first federal election for Indigenous people in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. Indigenous voting rights in other states had been in place since 1949. * 15 November - The Queensland Police Service raids the town of Mapoon, forcing residents at gunpoint to leave their houses and board a boat for relocation 200 km to the north. *30 November – Federal election: The Coalition government was returned with an increased majority of 10 seats over the Australian Labor Party.

The site in a suburb of Warrington was operated by CENTREX, the 'Central Police Training and Development Authority'. It opened in January 1946 and closed in May 2006.  Accommodation  Bruche was originally opened to provide accommodation for U.S. Air Force officers during the Second World War. It opened as a police training college in January 1946, as a temporary site to accommodate the number of police officers being trained after the Second World War. In 1955, it was one of the two UK police training centres that accommodated female police officers.  Curriculum  Police forces from the northern part of England and Wales sent new recruits to the centre for the main part of their basic training, which consisted of the development of important attitudes and behaviours, law training and officer safety tactics. Training included several role-play scenarios to enable the development and assessment of important abilities. Newly recruited probationary officers would spend a solid 15 weeks at Bruche before ever stepping onto the street, after having also spent time at their own Force's regional training centre(s). The centre was the site of Sandford, a mock village used for law enforcement training. The training village allowed police recruits could engage in simulations of routine police activities such as dealing with traffic accidents, football hooligans, and investigating robberies. Criminals, victims and bystanders were portrayed by civilian locals of the Bruche area.BBC (13 January 2003). \\"Cheshire's Police Training Village\\". BBC. Retrieved on 29 December 2007.  Secret Policeman documentary  In 2003, an investigative journalist trained undercover at Bruche, and exposed some police officers that used racist behaviour and language. The film was broadcast by the BBC Panorama programme in an episode called 'The Secret Policeman'.  Closure  Bruche was the only police training centre to remain in constant use throughout the years during the UK police forces used such facilities In May 2006, Bruche was closed because individual police forces became responsible for training their recruits internally. In 2013, Warrington Council gave permission for 220 houses to be built on the site.  Police forces trained  The police forces that sent officers to Bruche were mainly: * North Wales Police * South Yorkshire Police * West Yorkshire Police * Greater Manchester Police * Lancashire Constabulary * Cumbria Constabulary * Merseyside Police * Cheshire Constabulary * British Transport Police * Humberside Police * Lincolnshire Police * North Yorkshire Police * Isle of Man Constabulary * West Midlands Police * Thames Valley Police  Other police training schools  Forces in other parts of the country usually sent their recruits to similar centres at Ashford in Kent, Aykley Heads in Durham, Ryton-on-Dunsmore in Warwickshire and Cwmbran in South Wales. When the police training system changed in 2006 Ashford, Cwmbran and Bruche centres closed. Ryton is now used for other police and Immigration Service training. Aykley Heads (Durham) is now used to train Durham Constabulary and Northumbria Police Officers, as well as being Durham Constabulary HQ.

Their name came from the Berlin district of Pankow, which was once home to most of the officials of the East German government. The band's original lineup consisted of Jürgen Ehle, André Herzberg, Rainer Kirchmann, Jäcki Reznicek and Frank Hille. Other members were Stefan Dohanetz, Ingo York and Jens Jensen. As their lyrics often contained criticism of the East German regime, they frequently encountered problems releasing their music. \\"Like many writers, they were among the established names of aesthetic subversion,\\" the journalist Christoph Dieckmann wrote in a 1999 article published in Rolling Stone.Christoph Dieckmann: Nun machs gut, Inge Pawelczik, du Wilde!

ISSN 1612-9563 (1999), Issue 2, P. 14 With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the associated open access to media outside Germany Pankow also moved briefly into the focus of the Anglo-American journalism. The U.S. historian Timothy W. Ryback, known for his 1990 published book Rock around the bloc: a history of rock music in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, characterized Pankow as one of two most prestigious and most professional groups of East Berlin's rock music scene, writing that they \\"originally showed the influence of the Rolling Stones, but has developed into a dynamic band that combines the energy of the Clash with the innovation of the Talking Heads.\\" In the song \\"Langeweile\\" (\\"Boredom\\"), the criticism was expressed in the words \\"Seen the same country too long, heard the same language too often, waited too long, hoped too much, bowed down to the old men too often\\". The song \\"Paule Panke\\" was banned by the state-run Amiga record label, while \\"Langeweile\\" was banned from radio airplay; however, the band performed both at every concert. Pankow has occasionally been compared with the Rolling Stones Michael Rauhut: Rock in der DDR.

The declaration was drafted in response to HIV/AIDS denialism, and particularly to address South African president Thabo Mbeki's support for AIDS denialists. It was written several weeks before the 2000 International AIDS Conference, held in Durban, South Africa from July 9 to 14, 2000, and was published in the journal Nature to coincide with the Durban conference. The declaration called the evidence that HIV causes AIDS \\"clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous\\". Each person who signed the document was required to have a Ph.D. or M.D.-equivalent degree. To avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, scientists \\"working for commercial companies were asked not to sign.\\" The signatories included eleven Nobel prize winners.  Reaction  Michael Specter, writing in the New Yorker, called the Durban Declaration \\"one of the saddest documents in modern scientific history,\\" reflecting concern that Mbeki's embrace of AIDS denialism was a disastrous response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. Mbeki's government reportedly pressured South African scientists not to sign the document, and initially dismissed the Durban declaration. Health minister Manto Tshabalala- Msimang called it \\"elitist\\", while Mbeki's spokesperson said it belonged in a \\"dustbin\\". Several AIDS denialists criticized the Declaration in a letter to the editor of Nature, casting the issue as an abridgement of their rights to free speech and an intolerance of \\"alternative\\" viewpoints. In response, Nature later published a letter detailing inaccurate claims made by AIDS denialists in their attacks on the Declaration, and a second satirical letter from two AIDS researchers, stating: \\"We are staunch believers in the right to free speech, but is Nature the appropriate place to militate in favour of the pre-Copernican model of the universe or the existence of phlogiston?\\" In 2008, independent estimates by public health experts attributed over 300,000 preventable South African AIDS deaths and nearly 200,000 new HIV infections to government policies based on the AIDS denialist assertions criticised by the Durban Declaration.

It included most of the SWPs trade union base, as well as others sympathetic to the \\"Pabloist\\" line of the International Secretariat of the Fourth International, though it was never recognized as a section of the ISFI.  History  A dissident tendency had begun to crystallize within the SWPs Michigan/Ohio District around 1948-1949 led by Bert Cochran. It included the SWP fractions within the UAW locals in Flint and Detroit, Michigan, as well as Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio; the fractions in the United Rubber Workers in Akron, led by Jules Geller; and a group around Harry Braverman within the United Steelworkers in Youngstown. This tendency was beginning to have grave doubts about the sectarian nature of the SWP, and felt that the concepts of democratic centralism and the vanguard party were out of place in the context of the United States in the 1950s. They did not believe that capitalism was heading for a revolutionary crisis, and felt that a socialist educational group for propaganda among the workers was more appropriate at that point than a vanguard party. They also believed in making alliances with the Communists within the CIO unions to fight against expulsions, and that Communists and fellow travelers should be the primary area of recruitment, especially as many were becoming disillusioned with Stalinism.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.836-7 A related, but distinct tendency was led by George Clarke, the SWP representative on the International Secretariat and Milton Zaslow, the Organizer of the SWPs New York local. This group was more directly influenced by the ideas of Michel Pablo, the secretary of the Fourth International at the time. They believed that because of the pressures of the Cold War the masses had forced the Soviet Union and the other Degenerated workers' states to become more revolutionary. In concert with Pablo aligned Trotskyists in other countries, this group felt that it would be best under the circumstances focus on recruiting among Communists and fellow travelers, in lieu of formal entrismAlexander pp.837-8 The formal split began in early 1953 when Zaslow presented a document, \\"Report and Tasks\\", to the New York Local outlining his ideas. This set off a spirited debate within the party, even though a \\"truce\\" was attempted by the leaderships May Plenum. In August of that year the Zaslow group lost control of the New York Local in a city convention. A final split was \\"provoked\\" in late October when the oppositionists boycotted the 25th anniversary celebration of the expulsion of James Cannon, Max Shachtman and Martin Abern from the Communist Party, which they regarded as the foundation of their movement. When they refused to disavow the boycott they were expelled.Alexander pp.839-40 The split cost the SWP 25% of its membership, most of its base within organized labor and its entire organization in the state of Michigan.Alexander pp.835,841 The expelled members formed the American Socialist Union and began publishing a newspaper, the American Socialist. For the first three months of its existence, negotiations for unity were attempted between the Fourth International, the SWP and the ASU. When, three or months later this proved to be impossible Pablo asked the ASU to become the new US affiliate of the International Secretariat the Cochranites declined, believing that that would just lead the Socialist Union to become a kind of sect that feared the SWP had become.Alexander p.841 The Cochranites focused much of their activity on publishing their newspaper, American Socialist. They kept their publication \\"ecumenical\\" open to people of various leftist philosophies, including Michael Harrington and W. E. B. Du Bois. Their major constituency was among the former SWP members within the CIO and ex-CIO unions, though they also attempted to recruit among the dissidents who left the Communist Party after its crisis of 1956-1957. Zaslow, Clarke and Irving Beinin left in 1957 to work within the remnants of the American Labor Party and in the group around The Guardian magazine, where Beinin became editor. By the late 1950s, Braverman and Geller were becoming increasingly attracted to Monthly Review and disenchanted with Cochrans style of journalism.

The film features characters from Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise, based on the original characters from the A. A. Milne treasured books. The story is an Easter-themed adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novella A Christmas Carol. Unlike A Very Merry Pooh Year and Seasons of Giving, Springtime with Roo does not reuse episodes from The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Plot It is Easter, and Roo, Tigger, Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore head to Rabbit's house for an Easter egg hunt. However Rabbit has organized a \\"Spring Cleaning\\" Day instead. He orders the gang to clean his house while he tidies up in his garden. Initially dejected, the gang, not wanting to let Rabbit down, proceed to carry out Rabbit's orders. While dusting, Pooh sneezes violently, cluttering the house. A large trunk falls out of Rabbit's closet, revealing Easter eggs, decorations, and his Easter Bunny top hat. Assuming that Rabbit had forgotten about Easter, the gang decide to surprise Rabbit by decorating the house, only for a angry Rabbit to literally throw them out of his house for disobeying his orders, trampling his hat in the process. Tigger returns to Rabbit's house and tries to persuade him, but Rabbit refuses, declaring that the Hundred Acre Wood will never celebrate Easter again. Tigger and the narrator tell Rabbit that he used to love Easter, but Rabbit does not believe them, so Tigger takes him back through the book to last year's Easter celebration. In the flashback, the gang prepares for Easter, painting eggs and making decorations. Rabbit wants everything to be as organized and orderly as possible, treating Easter as a professional occasion rather than a fun holiday. The others grow tired of Rabbit's bossiness and, under Tigger's suggestion, sneak off with the Easter eggs. Rabbit goes after them and finds them having the egg hunt without him, with the gang agreeing that Tigger is \\"the best Easter Bunny ever,\\" upsetting Rabbit. Outside the book, Rabbit admits to Tigger that he did once look forward to being the Easter Bunny, but his exclusion the previous year made him feel unwanted. Tigger says that it was not his intention to leave him out, but Rabbit, still bitter about the past, continues to deny the Hundred Acre Wood Easter. Tigger returns to the present and delivers the bad news, while Rabbit makes his way back home. The narrator purposely stops on the wrong page, at Roo's house, where Roo says he wishes he could make things up to Rabbit. However, Rabbit remains unconvinced and returns home. He puts away Piglet's Easter basket, Pooh's honey pot, Eeyore's bunny ears and Tigger's striped Easter egg in the trunk and goes to sleep, only to be woken up by the narrator, speaking in a ghost-like voice before transporting him forward in time to \\"unwritten pages of the book\\" – the future of the Hundred Acre Wood. On one page, it is Spring Cleaning Day and everything is organized exactly as Rabbit wants. Initially delighted, he asks where everyone is, thinking that they are late, but the narrator says that they all moved away because of his selfishness. Refusing to believe this, Rabbit tries to find them but realizes that the narrator wasn't kidding when he discovers that their homes are empty and abandoned. This leads him to regret his terrible behavior towards his friends, but the narrator claims he didn't treat them like friends and that he only cared about himself. Denying this at first, Rabbit finally realizes how his selfish actions have affected his friends and tries to atone for his mistakes. He runs back to his house intent on having Easter, only to find out that their things have gone with them. Rabbit then wakes up on Easter morning and finds himself back in the present, overjoyed to realize that he still has a chance to change the future when he sees the Easter supplies are back in the box. Now \\"giddy as a jackrabbit\\", he immediately begins to plan the grandest Easter the Hundred Acre Wood has ever had. At the same time, Roo and the others, unaware that Rabbit has changed, come up with another idea in hopes of cheering Rabbit up. While they are busy working, Rabbit, pretending to still be grumpy, interrupts them, but their fears fade when he surprises them with their Easter decorations, along with a new bunny tail for Eeyore. Rabbit shows them the celebration he prepared and reveals his change of heart, which everyone is very happy to see, especially Roo, who gives Rabbit his Easter Bunny hat, now repaired. The spirit of Easter is now restored, and Roo pops out of the book and says, \\"BBFN, Bye-Bye For Now!\\", ending the film.

A prolific character actor, Silva has been a regular staple of international genre cinema often as a criminal or gangster. Notable film appearances include Ocean's 11 (1960), The Manchurian Candidate (1962), Johnny Cool (1963), Sharky's Machine (1981), and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999). Early life and career Silva was born in Brooklyn, New York City, of Sicilian and Spanish descent.DVD commentary for The Return of Mr. Moto, Mr. Moto Collection - Vol. 2, 20th Century Fox, 2007-02-13 He grew up in Harlem and quit school when he was 13 years old to attend drama classes, supporting himself as a dishwasher and waiter at a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was accepted. When the Studio staged Michael V. Gazzo's play A Hatful of Rain as a classroom project (which itself grew out of an earlier improvisation by Silva, Paul Richards and Anthony Franciosa, based on a scene written by Gazzo, entitled \\"Pot\\"), it proved so successful that it was presented on Broadway, with students Ben Gazzara, Shelley Winters, Harry Guardino, along with Franciosa, Richards and Silva, in key roles. Silva also appeared in the play's film version. Early film roles and typecasting In Hollywood, he played a succession of villains in films including The Tall T (1957) with Randolph Scott, The Bravados (1958) with Gregory Peck and The Law and Jake Wade (1958).

Silva gradually became typecast playing mobsters, robbers and other criminals, although he did play a comic role as one of the stepbrothers in the 1960 Jerry Lewis film Cinderfella, a parody of Cinderella with Lewis in the title role. He appeared in two episodes of The Outer Limits television series. Other TV appearances included as a hitman in the episode \\"Better Bargain\\" on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, plus roles on episodes of The Untouchables, Rod Serling's Night Gallery, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Mission Impossible, as well as Boris Karloff's suspense series Thriller. In 1963, Silva played the lead role in the gangster film Johnny Cool, which was produced by United Artists and Chrislaw. His character Salvatore \\"Johnny Cool\\" Giordano was a hitman sent on a mission by exiled mobster Johnny Colini to kill the underworld figures who had plotted against the mobster. Premiering on October 19, 1963, the film was successful at the box-office and was critically well received. So was the actor's first lead performance, which carried the film. The supporting cast features Elizabeth Montgomery, Mort Sahl, Telly Savalas, Jim Backus, Joey Bishop, and Sammy Davis, Jr., most of whose characters were murdered by Silva's during the course of the film. Variety praised Silva's performance, writing \\"Henry Silva, as a Sicilian-born assassin, is at home as the 'delivery boy of death'\\".Variety, Review: Johnny Cool The film's box-office receipts dropped by late November (partly due to the death of President John F. Kennedy). In 1965, an Italian film producer made Silva an offer to star as a hero for a change and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, The Hills Run Red (1966), which made him a hot box-office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. Between 1966 and 1977 he starred or co-starred in at least 25 movies, the majority of which were Italian Poliziotteschi films, where he normally played the villain or hitman, or the dark hero, or a combination of the two. His best remembered of these are Manhunt (1972), Il Boss (1973), and Almost Human (1974). He also appeared against type as the Japanese detective Mr. Moto in the 1965 murder mystery The Return of Mr. Moto, and as an Apache who helps rape victim Michele Carey in the 1970 revenge western Five Savage Men. Returning to the United States in the mid-1970s, he co-starred with Frank Sinatra in Contract on Cherry Street (1977) and Charles Bronson in Love and Bullets (1979). He then signed on as the evil adversary Killer Kane in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979). 1980s-2000s career In the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared as the arrogant hunter Colonel Brock in Alligator (1980), a drug-addicted hitman in Burt Reynolds' Sharky's Machine (1981), a former prison warden-turned-enforcer in Escape from the Bronx (1983), which was lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy gangster in Cannonball Run II (1984) opposite many of his former Rat Pack buddies, the villainous CIA agent Kurt Zagon in Steven Seagal's debut Above the Law (1988), the sinister mob hitman Influence in Dick Tracy (1990), and the voice of the ruthless supervillain Bane in Batman: The Animated Series (1994) and The New Batman Adventures (1998). Silva also plays the crime boss Ray Vargo in Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) who puts out a hit on the titular character. Silva also starred as himself in a spoof of In Search of ...-type shows in the comedy Amazon Women on the Moon (1987) for a segment titled Henry Silva's \\"Bullshit, or Not!\\", and played a spectator at a boxing match in the 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven.

It is possible that Jan Mendoses' real name was Juan [de] Mendoza. There is considerable doubt about his nationality, some sources claiming he was a Belgian named Mandaus, others that he was Spanish. He may even have been a merchant heading for Russia, rather than the \\"notorious pirate\\" claimed by Danish sources. According to the Danes, he had earlier been raiding the Faroe Islands with the English pirate Thomas Tucker who had formerly served under the English pirate Admiral Easton. In 1614, Tucker fitted out his first pirate command in Morocco and seems to have recruited Mendoses there. Mendoses was captured by the Danish Admiral Jørgen Daa off the north coast of Norway in 1615. The future explorer, Jens Munk, served on Daa's ship and a book, Compendio del arte de navegar, which he took from Mendoses' ship, is now in the Danish Royal Library. Mendoses was taken back to Copenhagen where he was hanged.

By 1799, Kleist had been promoted to major and was put in command of a battalion of grenadiers. Kleist served in the Napoleonic Wars and fought at Jena. In 1807 he went on extended leave but by 1808 he was put in command of an infantry brigade and the next year he was made commandant of Berlin. During the War of Liberation he was given a corps with which he fought in the battles of Kulm and Leipzig. In 1814, he was given the title Count of Nollendorf (from the German name of the town Nakléřov, now part of Petrovice in the Czech Republic) for his decisive role in this battle. After Leipzig, Kleist blockaded the fortress of Erfurt, bringing about its surrender after which, in early 1814, he marched his troops into France, where his corps was attached to Blücher's army. He then fought in the battle of Laon and in the attack on Paris. At the end of the war Kleist was promoted to the rank of '. During the Hundred Days, Kleist was given command of a Prussian corps (the North German Corps) which was to operate independently from Blücher's Army of the Lower Rhine; he was therefore not involved in the battles of Ligny and Waterloo.

It was first described by Colin Campbell Sanborn, curator of Field Museum of Natural History, in 1951. The black-shouldered opossum is characterized by a gray coat, gray underbelly, and broad black stripes that extend from the forefeet, meet on the shoulders, run along the midline of the back and then split into parallel stripes that run down the hindfeet. Little is known of the behavior of the black-shouldered opossum. It is nocturnal (active mainly at night) and arboreal (tree-living); it is known to feed on fruits and rodents. The opossum inhabits humid forests. The IUCN classifies it as least concern. Taxonomy The black-shouldered opossum is the sole member of Caluromysiops, and is placed in the family Didelphidae. It was first described by Colin Campbell Sanborn, curator of Field Museum of Natural History, in 1951. No subspecies are recognized. The cladogram below, based on a 2016 study, shows the phylogenetic relationships of the brown-eared woolly opossum. Description The black-shouldered opossum is characterized by a gray coat, gray underbelly with buff-tipped hairs, and broad black stripes that extend from the forefeet, meet on the shoulders, run along the midline of the back and then split into parallel stripes that run down the hindfeet. Indistinct dark lines run through the eyes. 60 to 75 percent of the length of the tail is darker than the coat dorsally (on the back), while the rest is white. Except for the last 75 percent of the length at the base, the tail is bushy. Like Caluromys species, its fur is soft, thick and woolly, and has a similar skull. However, it differs from them in having a shorter rostrum and larger molars. The head-and-body length is between and the tail measures . The hindfeet measure , while the ears . Ecology and behavior Little is known of the behavior of the black-shouldered opossum. It is nocturnal (active mainly at night) and arboreal (tree-living). It spends a significant amount of time on trees, mainly on high branches. Studies suggest individual diet preferences; the opossums feed on rodents as well as fruits. Lifespan in captivity has been known to exceed seven years. Up to two young have been recorded. Distribution and status The black-shouldered opossum occurs in humid forests of western Brazil and southeastern Peru, and probably in Bolivia as well. It is known only from five different localities. The IUCN classifies it as least concern given its wide distribution and presumably large population. A possible threat to their survival is deforestation.

The Blickling Homilies is the name given to a collection of anonymous homilies from Anglo-Saxon England. They are written in Old English, and were written down at some point before the end of the tenth century, making them one of the oldest collections of sermons to survive from medieval England, the other main witness being the Vercelli Book.D. G. Scragg, 'The Homilies of the Blickling Manuscript', in Learning and Literature in Anglo- Saxon England: Studies Presented to Peter Clemoes on the Occasion of his Sixty-Fifth Birthday, ed. by Michael Lapidge and Helmut Gneuss (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 299-316 (at p. 315). Their name derives from Blickling Hall in Norfolk, which once housed them; the manuscript is now Princeton, Scheide Library, MS 71. The Homilies The homilies in the collection deal primarily with Lent, with items for Passion Sunday, Palm Sunday and Holy Week, as well as homilies dealing with Rogation Days, Ascension Day and Pentecost. The rest of the homilies in the collection are saints’ feast days. As numbered in the first edition of the homilies, by Richard Morris, the contents are: # Incarnation of the Lord (In Natali Domini) # Quinquagesima/Shrove Sunday (Dominica Prima in Quinquagesima) # The First Sunday in Lent (Dominica Prima in Quadragesima) # The Third Sunday in Lent (Dominica Tertia in Quadragesima) # The Fifth Sunday in Lent (Dominica V in Quadragesima) # Palm Sunday (Dominica VI in Quadragesima) # Easter Day (Dominica Pascha) # Rogation Monday (To Þam Forman Gangdæge), called \\"Soul's Need\\" by Morrris # Rogation Tuesday (To Þam Oþerum Gangdæge), called \\"Christ the Golden-Blossom\\" by Morris # Rogation Wednesday (To Þam Þriddan Gangdæge), called \\"The End of This World is Near\\" by Morris # Ascension Thursday (On Þa Halgan Þunres Dei) # Pentecost Sunday (Pentecostent - Spiritus Domini) # Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Sancta Maria Mater Domini Nostri Iesu Cristi) # The Birth of John the Baptist (Sancte Iohannes Baptista Spel) # The Story of SS Peter and Paul (Spel Be Petrus ond Paulus).

Andreas); lacks beginning and ending. Origin and audience of the collection Little is known about the origin of the homilies or their intended audience. In the assessment of D. G. Scragg, the manuscript :is in origin a collection, put together, perhaps over a period of time, from a number of sources ... the scribes took care to put together a book which followed a preconceived design, following the chronology of the church year, and they perhaps took individual items from different sources, rather than blocks of items. There is little overlap with the homilies of the Vercelli Book, from south-eastern England, suggesting that the Blickling Homilies were gathered in a different regional and intellectual milieu; the language of the Homilies suggests a Mercian origin'. The collection does have some overlaps with another homily collection, MS Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 198, whose origins are also poorly understood,D. G. Scragg, 'The Homilies of the Blickling Manuscript', in Learning and Literature in Anglo-Saxon England: Studies Presented to Peter Clemoes on the Occasion of his Sixty-Fifth Birthday, ed. by Michael Lapidge and Helmut Gneuss (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 299-316 (at pp. 315-16). but which are likely to have been in the West Midlands.Mary Swan, 'Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 198 and the Blickling Manuscript', Leeds Studies in English, n.s. 37 (2006), pp. 89-100, . Meanwhile, although it is surely significant that the homilies were in Old English rather than Latin, 'little sense of a specific congregation or reading audience prevails in this collection of ancient and commonplace materials for the instruction of Christian folk', and the intended audience of the material is essentially unknown.Milton McC. Gatch, 'The Unknowable Audience of the Blickling Homilies', Anglo-Saxon England, 18 (1989), 99-115 (at 115); . Blickling Homily XVI The most famous and extensively studied of the Blickling Homilies is XVI (XVII in the numbering of Morris's edition), 'To Sanctae Michaeles Mæssan' ('On St Michael's Mass', generally celebrated on September 29 in tenth- to eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon England).Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 49-50. The homily is not noted for being well composed,The Longman anthology of Old English, Old Icelandic and Anglo-Norman Literatures, ed. by Richard North, Joe Allard and Patricia Gillies (Harlow: Longman, 2011) but for its relationship with Anglo-Saxon pilgrimage to Italy on the one hand, and some striking similarities with the Old English poem Beowulf on the other. The homily is a translation of a version of a Latin hagiographical text known as 'De apparitione Sancti Michaelis' (Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina 5948).Ed. by G. Waitz in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum (Havover 1898), pp. 541-43; reprinted, with an English translation, in Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 110-15. This story provides a foundation myth for the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo, in Apulia, southeast Italy, the oldest Western European church dedicated to St Michael and a major pilgrimage site in the Middle Ages. Our earliest manuscripts of 'De apparitione' are of the early ninth century, and so this version was probably composed in the eighth century. The text tells of three different 'apparitions' by St Michael, which 'appear to have nothing in common and suggest at least three layers of narrative accretion'; the oldest strata of the text seem to go back to an earlier, lost version of perhaps the sixth century.Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 37-38. Having come to Italy from the Near East, the cult of Michael spread to Frankia, where peregrinating Irish monks learned of it; the cult became popular in Ireland, from where the cult had spread to Anglo-Saxon England already by the seventh century.Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 45-46. It is also clear that a number of Anglo-Saxon pilgrims passed through Monte Gargano: among the many pilgrims who inscribed their names on the cave walls, five bore Anglo-Saxon names, some inscribing in runes. Their date is uncertain but must be between c. 700 and c. 850.Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 36-37. In the assessment of North, Allard, and Gillies, 'this aspect of history transforms the genre of this work [Blickling Homily XVI] ... from ... homily to tourist brochure'.The Longman anthology of Old English, Old Icelandic and Anglo-Norman Literatures, ed. by Richard North, Joe Allard and Patricia Gillies (Harlow: Longman, 2011) Blickling Homily XVI seems to have a common source with Ælfric of Eynsham's later homily for September 29, which was clearly a Latin or vernacular version of the 'De apparitione'.Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 56-63. The most striking difference between Blickling Homily XVI and the Latin text of which it is a translation is that Blickling Homily XVI ends with a description of Hell, derived ultimately from the Visio sancti Pauli; the closest parallels are with a ninth-century, Latin version of the Visio known as Redaction XI,M. E. Dwyer, 'An Unstudied Redaction of the Visio Paul', Manuscripta, 32 (1988), 121-38. of Insular and probably Irish origin.Charles D. Wright, The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 6 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 106-36. The Blickling Homily XVI description of Hell is recognised as a close parallel to the description of Grendel's home in Beowulf (lines 2719-33). The homily may have influenced the poem directly, or both texts may have drawn on common sources;Andy Orchard, Pride and Prodigies: Studies in the Monsters of the ‘Beowulf’-Manuscript, rev. edn (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2003), pp. 38-41. the main recent study of the connection is Charles D. Wright's, which argues for independent descent from a common source.Charles D. Wright, The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature, Cambridge Studies in Anglo- Saxon England, 6 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 116-36.

Primarily a or , Young spent his entire playing career at the Dragons, winning a premiership with them in 2010, and represented Australia and New South Wales. Background Born in Sydney, New South Wales, Young played his junior rugby league for the Dapto Canaries and attended Dapto High School before being signed by the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Young's father, Craig, played 234 games for the St. George Dragons, winning two premierships, and represented Australia and New South Wales. Playing career In 2000, Young represented the New South Wales under-17 team while playing in the lower grades for the Illawarra Steelers. In Round 2 of the 2003 NRL season, Young made his debut for the Dragons against the Parramatta Eels. He became a regular of the Dragons NRL side following his debut, playing at either lock, hooker or second row. In 2006, Young was selected as 18th man for New South Wales in the 2006 State of Origin decider in Melbourne, but did not play. In 2007, Young played just three NRL games, missing the majority of the season due to a knee injury incurred in 2006 from a Lance Thompson tackle. His recovery was further hindered by complications from surgery which was performed to address this injury. In Round 3 of the 2008 NRL season, Young played his 100th NRL game in a 14–21 loss to the Canberra Raiders. In July 2009, Young signed a three-year contract with the Dragons. In May 2010, Young was selected to represent Country in the annual City vs Country Origin game, scoring two tries in Country's first victory since 2006. On 3 October 2010, Young started at and scored a try in the Dragons' 32–8 Grand Final win over the Sydney Roosters.. In November 2010, Young was selected in the Australian squad for the Four Nations, making his Test debut in a 34–20 win over New Zealand. In 2011, Young represented New South Wales for the first time, starting at in their 12–16 Game I loss to Queensland. On 10 April 2012, Young announced that he would retire at the end of the 2012 NRL season. In Round 15 of the 2012 season, Young played his 200th NRL game in a 20–28 loss to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Coaching career In 2013, Young coached the Illawarra Steelers SG Ball Cup side. In 2014, Young and former teammate Ben Hornby were named co-coaches of the Dragons' under-20s team. They finished 4th and made it to the preliminary finals. In 2015, Young became an assistant coach for the Dragons' NRL side, under head coach Paul McGregor. In 2019, Young worked as an assistant coach for the Tongan national team. In February 2020, he was an assistant coach for the Indigenous All Stars team. In 13 August 2020, Young was named interim head coach of the Dragons after Paul McGregor resigned mid-season. Following the club's round 17 loss against North Queensland in the 2020 NRL season, Young called out his players during the press conference saying \\"Same shit, different day,\\" Young said. \\"It went wrong in blokes not getting their jobs done. Again, for the second week in a row, the game was there to be won in the last five minutes which is what this club wants to be about. \\"We want to be fighting for the full 80 minutes, right to the death\\". On 16 September 2020, Young informed St. George Illawarra that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, despite being offered a position alongside incoming head coach Anthony Griffin. Following the club's round 19 defeat to Newcastle where the Red V lost 42-18, an angry Young spoke to the media saying “We wouldn’t have beaten Dapto the way we played in the first half. It was Under 8s stuff\\". On 25 September 2020, Young signed a three-year deal with the North Queensland Cowboys, joining the club as an assistant to incoming head coach Todd Payten. In round 20 of the 2020 NRL season, Young guided St. George Illawarra to a 30-22 victory over a depleted Melbourne at Kogarah Oval in his last game in charge as interim head coach.

The play involves forcing that hand to ruff, only to be overruffed. A similar motive is met in coup en passant, where indirect finesse is used instead of direct. In the end position below, spades are trump. The king of spades is onside, but declarer (South) cannot finesse against it because dummy has no trumps remaining. Declarer takes all three tricks by playing a heart first. When a club is led from dummy, East has nothing but spades remaining and therefore must ruff, and South can overruff with the ace or queen according to which spade East plays. A trump coup is not possible in a double-finesse position, since declarer with a holding like A-Q-10 over defender's K-J-x would take the first trump trick and then would have to give the defender a free finesse. In effect, a trump coup against a king (or rather, the second-highest remaining trump) must find it guarded by exactly one other trump. (If East held another card instead of the small trump, say a diamond, North-South could still play the hand as just described, but the trump coup would be unnecessary as South could just drop the king of spades instead.) Similarly, with A-K-J of trumps in hand, a trump coup against Q-x-x on the right is possible, and so on. To execute a trump coup, declarer must have exactly the same number of trumps as the defender. If declarer had more trumps, entry could not be given to dummy at the critical point when the defender will have only trumps remaining. Sometimes a declarer with too many trumps, but needing to do a trump coup, can set up the desired position by entering dummy and leading a suit he can ruff, to shorten his own trumps. Grand coup If the card which is ruffed in order to shorten the trumps would have been a winner, the play is called a grand coup: South, having opened strong 2, plays in 6. West leads a diamond to East's ace, who returns a heart to South's ace. South plays A-K of trumps and discovers the bad break. Now, South has to ruff his high spades in dummy twice to shorten its trumps to the same length as West; he cashes two high spades, discarding a heart from dummy, and ruffs the spade queen. Next, he enters his hand with the Q and ruffs another spade. He cashes the K, and reenters his hand with the K. At that point, North and West have only two trumps each--K 10 and J 9 respectively. Either a heart or a spade from South's hand completes the coup. Endplay variation A similar tactic can also be used to create an endplay situation, with similar results to the more ordinary trump coup: In this six- card ending, originally given as a whist hand, clubs are trumps and the lead is in the North hand. To win five of the six remaining tricks (one trick must be lost in any event, as the 9 8 form a sure winner in the East hand), the 10 must be led from dummy and South must ruff with a low club (executing the grand coup in doing so). After this the A K must be cashed, and finally a low club led from hand. East can now win only one trump trick--if he takes this trick he will be endplayed into leading into South's remaining trump tenace and lose the last two tricks, while if he ducks, he will of course prosaically lose his 9 or 8 to South's J and win only trick 13. South wins a trick less if he plays otherwise, as the tempo of the situation is altered and it will be South who becomes endplayed at trick 12 to give up a second trump winner to East--if he does not ruff dummy's heart winner, after giving up the first trump trick to East, the latter will still have a major suit card at trick 11 in addition to his two trumps, which he will lead to compel South to ruff and again lead trumps up to East. If he executes the coup but then fails to cash both spades before touching trumps, East will lead his remaining spade to force South back on lead to give up a second trump trick. Often, for a trump coup to work, the key defender must have a suitable distribution in other suits, so that he cannot ruff a declarer's winner prematurely.

Club career Born in Tondela, Viseu District, Piloto was brought up in the youth system of Académica de Coimbra. His first season as a senior would be spent with semi-professional Anadia FC, in 2001–02, after which he played two years with Académica's reserves in the third division; his debut with the first team arrived late into 2002–03. Piloto was used irregularly in his first years with the main squad (six Primeira Liga appearances, then 25 and nine), definitely becoming an important part in 2007–08 and scoring his first league goals in the following campaign in home matches against C.D. Nacional (1–1) and C.F. Os Belenenses (1–0). By this time, he was already team captain. In June 2009, after rejecting offers for a new deal, Piloto moved abroad and signed a three- year contract with Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. in Greece. In the end of July, during pre-season training, he suffered a tear in the ligaments of his left knee after a strong challenge by Matías Lequi, being sidelined for six months. The surgery took place in his country, on 10 August, being performed by FC Porto's medical staff. After failing to make a single appearance, Piloto returned to Portugal and signed a two-year deal with top flight club S.C. Olhanense. On 6 September 2013, after three years with little playing time, narrowly avoiding relegation in his last, he rejoined Académica. On 23 June 2016, in spite of his team's relegation to the Segunda Liga, 34-year-old Piloto renewed his contract – about to expire – for another year. Academic career Still as a professional footballer, Piloto graduated from the University of Coimbra with a degree in biochemistry, majoring in 2005. This was followed by a master's degree in 2009.

It details the methods by which the Norstrilians (or \\"Old North Australians\\") of Smith's fictional \\"Instrumentality\\" universe maintain their monopoly on the precious immortality drug stroon. The story details part of the background to the novel Norstrilia (which references the Kittons once in its introduction as a sure method of death). The story has been alluded to in Charles Stross's Glasshouse.http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog- static/2010/08/interview-1.html#comment-56799  Background Cordwainer Smith is a pseudonym of Paul Linebarger, the noted China expert, who wrote most of his published science-fiction stories within the setting of the Instrumentality of Mankind. For many millennia, the rather static structure of this society (on those planets which the Instrumentality directly administered) was of Lords of the Instrumentality ruling over humans (who were allowed a fixed 400-year lifespan) and a large number of exploited animal- derived \\"Underpeople\\" servants. The use of the immortality drug \\"stroon\\" from the world of Norstrilia was a vital tool in maintaining this order. =Norstrilia= The planet of Norstrilia, or in full the Commonwealth of Old North Australia, was settled by sheep farmers ultimately from a post-nuclear- war Australia (though with many historical vicissitudes -- such as a stay on the hell-world Paradise VII -- before they found their current prosperity). The political system is based on a monarchy with \\"her absent majesty\\" the Queen as nominal head of state. However, the Queen has been lost for millennia (\\"But she might bloody well turn up one of these days.\\"Norstrilia, 1995. Cordwainer Smith, NESFA Press, , page 7), and a local deputy and Commonwealth Council fulfill her role until she returns. The organization of the planet is based on Stations, or large farm allotments passed down through generations. =Stroon= The sheep that were brought to this planet by the Australian immigrants have over time been affected by the planet's environment in two ways. Firstly, the sheep have grown enormously due to a local disease and are now larger than houses and completely immobile, requiring constant attention. Secondly, the sheep began to produce the immortality drug stroon. Norstrilia is the richest planet in the entire Instrumentality due to the value of the immortality drug stroon, and as such it and its people are targets of kidnap and theft attempts. The citizens are highly trained in self-defense, but the planet strategically maintains \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\" for its defense. =Viola Siderea= This is a robber planet, once rich and civilized, but now reduced to a dog-eat-dog existence which has created a ruling class of highly sophisticated thieves. Benjacomin Bozart is a Warden of the Thieves' Guild, trained and prepared to raid Norstrilia for its stroon. Due to the impossibility of overpowering a Norstrilian adult, he ruthlessly drugs and kills a small Norstrilian boy on a vacation world to find out the nature of the planet's defenses, but the only information he gets is the name \\"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\\" scrawled in the sand at a beach. He consults the Guild's encyclopedia, which says that the phrase is an archaic term for the disease caused by the stroon virus — no-one being aware that this is a cover story planted by a Norstrilian agent. Confident of obtaining the stroon, Bozart pays out immense bribes using Viola Siderea's credit to illicitly charter ships, further unaware that he is paying other Norstrilian agents who have tracked him since he murdered the child. The last leg of the journey drops his space yacht into orbit around Norstrilia. = Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons= A 21-faceted moon and a network of relay stations are placed around the planet. Resident on the moon is Mother Hitton, a woman who is the \\"weapons mistress\\" and in charge of the care and feeding of the \\"Littul Kittons\\", which are in fact mink that have been selectively bred for centuries for psychotic, self-destructive madness. They (necessarily) spend almost all their lives under anaesthesia, only allowed to waken to mate or when needed for defense. The brain patterns of these mad mink are focused into an intense telepathic beam that can be directed at any incoming space ship from the relay station, driving all humans into a self-destructive madness -- as Bozart discovers first-hand. The odd spelling of the \\"Littul Kittons\\" is intentional, as research into the term would act as a tripwire, alerting the Norstrilian defenses to potential hostile activity. After his death the extent of the Norstrilians' revenge is revealed: Bozart's bribes have incurred a debt of 400 million man-megayears for Viola Siderea.

Complete asthenozoospermia, that is, 100% immotile spermatozoa in the ejaculate, is reported at a frequency of 1 of 5000 men. Causes of complete asthenozoospermia include metabolic deficiencies, ultrastructural abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (see Primary ciliary dyskinesia) and necrozoospermia. It decreases the sperm quality and is therefore one of the major causes of infertility or reduced fertility in men. A method to increase the chance of pregnancy is ICSI. The percentage of viable spermatozoa in complete asthenozoospermia varies between 0 and 100%. DNA fragmentation Sperm DNA fragmentation level is higher in men with sperm motility defects (asthenozoospermia) than in men with oligozoospermia or teratozoospermia. Among men with asthenozoospermia, 31% were found to have high levels of DNA fragmentation. As reviewed by Wright et al., high levels of DNA fragmentation have been shown to be a robust indicator of male infertility. Asthenozoospermia and DHA  In 2015, Eslamian et al. found a correlation between the composition of the sperm lipid membrane and the odds of having asthenozoospermia. The sperm that have more polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) shown better fertility results. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is an acid form by six double bons which allows the fluidity of the membrane, necessary to the fusion with the ovule. Studies in mice have shown that DHA is essential for acrosome reaction and a DHA deficiency results in abnormal sperm morphology, loss of motility and infertility; which can be restored by dietary DHA supplementation. Furthermore, the supplementation with DHA in human has been reported to increase sperm motility. But also, DHA supplement can protect spermatozoa against the damage caused by the cryopresevation process.

First the approximate magnitude of individual terms in the equations is determined. Then some negligibly small terms may be ignored. Example: vertical momentum in synoptic-scale meteorology Consider for example the momentum equation of the Navier–Stokes equations in the vertical coordinate direction of the atmosphere :{{\\\\partial w }\\\\over{\\\\partial t }} + u {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x}} + v {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial y}} + w {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial z}} - {\\\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}}= - { { \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}}} - g +2{\\\\Omega u \\\\cos \\\\varphi} + u \\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x^2}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial y^2}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial z^2}}\\\\right),\\\\qquad(1) where R is Earth radius, Ω is frequency of rotation of the Earth, g is gravitational acceleration, φ is latitude, ρ is density of air and ν is kinematic viscosity of air (we can neglect turbulence in free atmosphere). In synoptic scale we can expect horizontal velocities about U = 101 m.s−1 and vertical about W = 10−2 m.s−1. Horizontal scale is L = 106 m and vertical scale is H = 104 m. Typical time scale is T = L/U = 105 s. Pressure differences in troposphere are ΔP = 104 Pa and density of air ρ = 100 kg*m−3. Other physical properties are approximately: :R = 6.378 × 106 m; :Ω = 7.292 × 10−5 rad*s−1; :ν = 1.46 × 10−5 m2*s−1; :g = 9.81 m*s−2. Estimates of the different terms in equation (1) can be made using their scales: : \\\\begin{align} {{\\\\partial w }\\\\over{\\\\partial t }} &\\\\sim \\\\frac{W}{T} \\\\[1.2ex] u {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x}} &\\\\sim U\\\\frac{W}{L} &\\\\qquad v {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial y}} &\\\\sim U\\\\frac{W}{L} &\\\\qquad w {\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial z}} &\\\\sim W\\\\frac{W}{H} \\\\[1.2ex] {\\\\frac{u^2}{R}} &\\\\sim \\\\frac{U^2}{R} &\\\\qquad {\\\\frac{v^2}{R}} &\\\\sim \\\\frac{U^2}{R} \\\\[1.2ex] \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z} &\\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta P}{H} &\\\\qquad \\\\Omega u \\\\cos \\\\varphi &\\\\sim \\\\Omega U \\\\[1.2ex] u \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x^2} &\\\\sim u \\\\frac{W}{L^2} &\\\\qquad u \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial y^2} &\\\\sim u \\\\frac{W}{L^2} &\\\\qquad u \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial z^2} &\\\\sim u \\\\frac{W}{H^2} \\\\end{align} Now we can introduce these scales and their values into equation (1): : {\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^5}}+10{\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}} +10{\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}} +10^{-2}{\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^4}} -{\\\\frac{10^2+10^2}{10^6}} : = - {{\\\\frac{1}{1}} {\\\\frac{10^4}{10^4}} } - 10 + 2 \\\\times 10^{-4} \\\\times 10 + 10^{-5} \\\\left({\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\\\\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{8}}} \\\\right). \\\\qquad (2) We can see that all terms — except the first and second on the right-hand side — are negligibly small. Thus we can simplify the vertical momentum equation to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation: :{ { \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}}} = - g. \\\\qquad (3) Rules of scale analysis Scale analysis is very useful and widely used tool for solving problems in the area of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, pressure-driven wall jet, separating flows behind backward- facing steps, jet diffusion flames, study of linear and non-linear dynamics. Scale analysis is recommended as the premier method for obtaining the most information per unit of intellectual effort, despite the fact that it is a precondition for good analysis in dimensionless form. The object of scale analysis is to use the basic principles of convective heat transfer to produce order-of-magnitude estimates for the quantities of interest. Scale analysis anticipates within a factor of order one when done properly, the expensive results produced by exact analyses. Scale analysis ruled as follows: Rule1- First step in scale analysis is to define the domain of extent in which we apply scale analysis. Any scale analysis of a flow region that is not uniquely defined is not valid. Rule2- One equation constitutes an equivalence between the scales of two dominant terms appearing in the equation. For example, : \\\\rho c_P {{\\\\partial T }\\\\over{\\\\partial t }} = k {\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}}. In the above example, the left-hand side could be of equal order of magnitude as the right-hand side. Rule3- If in the sum of two terms given by : c = a+b the order of magnitude of one term is greater than order of magnitude of the other term : O(a) > O(b) then the order of magnitude of the sum is dictated by the dominant term : O(c) = O(a) The same conclusion holds if we have the difference of two terms : c = a-b Rule4- In the sum of two terms, if two terms are same order of magnitude, : c = a+b : O(a) = O(b) then the sum is also of same order of magnitude: : O(a) \\\\thicksim O(b) \\\\thicksim O(c) Rule5- In case of product of two terms : p=ab the order of magnitude of the product is equal to the product of the orders of magnitude of the two factors : O(p) = O(a)O(b) for ratios : r = \\\\frac{a}{b} then : O(r) = \\\\frac{O(a)}{O(b)} here O(a) represents the order of magnitude of a. ~ represents two terms are of same order of magnitude. > represents greater than, in the sense of order-of-magnitude. Developing flow in the entrance region of a parallel-plates duct Scale analysis of fully developed flow Consider the steady laminar flow of a viscous fluid inside a circular tube. Let the fluid enter with a uniform velocity over the flow across section. As the fluid moves down the tube a boundary layer of low-velocity fluid forms and grows on the surface because the fluid immediately adjacent to the surface have zero velocity. A particular and simplifying feature of viscous flow inside cylindrical tubes is the fact that the boundary layer must meet itself at the tube centerline, and the velocity distribution then establishes a fixed pattern that is invariant. Hydrodynamic entrance length is that part of the tube in which the momentum boundary layer grows and the velocity distribution changes with length. The fixed velocity distribution in the fully developed region is called fully developed velocity profile. The steady-state continuity and conservation of momentum equations in two-dimensional are :{{\\\\partial u }\\\\over{\\\\partial x }} + {\\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y}}=0 , \\\\qquad(1) : u {{\\\\partial u }\\\\over{\\\\partial x }} + v {\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}} = - { { \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial x}}} + u \\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2}}\\\\right),\\\\qquad(2) : u {{\\\\partial v }\\\\over{\\\\partial x }} + v {\\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y}} = - { { \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varrho}}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial y}}} + u \\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 v}{\\\\partial x^2}}+{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 v}{\\\\partial y^2}}\\\\right),\\\\qquad(3) These equations can be simplified by using scale analysis. At any point x\\\\sim L in the fully developed zone, we have y\\\\sim\\\\delta and u\\\\sim U_\\\\infty . Now, from equation(1), the transverse velocity component in the fully developed region is simplified using scaling as : \\\\begin{align} v &\\\\sim {\\\\frac{U_{\\\\infty} \\\\delta}{L}} \\\\qquad(4) \\\\end{align} In the fully developed region L>>\\\\delta , so that the scale of the transverse velocity is negligible from equation (4). Therefore in fully developed flow, the continuity equation requires that :v=0, {{\\\\partial u }\\\\over{\\\\partial x }}=0 \\\\qquad(5) Based on equation(5), the y momentum equation (3) reduces to :{{\\\\partial P }\\\\over{\\\\partial y }}=0 \\\\qquad(6) this means that P is function of x only. From this, the x momentum equation becomes :{{d P }\\\\over{d x }}=\\\\mu {{d^2 u}\\\\over{d y^2 }}=constant \\\\qquad(7) Each term should be constant, because left side is function of x only and right is function of y. Solving equation(7) subject to the boundary condition : u=0, y=\\\\pm \\\\frac{D}{2} \\\\qquad(8) this results in the well-known Hagen–Poiseuille solution for fully developed flow between parallel plates. : u=\\\\frac{3}{2}U[1-{(\\\\frac{y}{D/2})}^2] \\\\qquad(9) : U=\\\\frac{D^2}{12\\\\mu}(-\\\\frac{dP}{dx}) \\\\qquad(10) where y is measured away from the center of the channel. The velocity is to be parabolic and is proportional to the pressure per unit duct length in the direction of the flow.

Just as the trump coup resembles a direct finesse, except that trumps are not the suit led, so the coup en passant similarly resembles an indirect finesse. Examples In this example, spades are trump, and declarer (South) takes two tricks by playing hearts first. Then, with clubs led from the dummy, declarer ruffs if and only if East does not. South's diamond loser will go under East's ace of spades on one of the last two tricks, and South's king will take the other trick. Here both players have the same number of trumps, but the hand would play the same way if either or both had a small trump in place of the small diamond. The important thing is that declarer must have few enough trumps that dummy can be entered at the critical time. Coup en passant can be performed even with several high trumps in the opponent's hand. In the example, South would lose all remaining tricks if the lead were in East's hand. However, if a heart is played from dummy, and East ruffs, South will discard the losing diamond (what is, in effect, a loser on loser play). If East discards, South will ruff, \\"stealing\\" a trick.

Its mission is to inspire and empower its members to elevate the health and wellness of their communities.  Purpose and mission  The mission of the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is to inspire and empower its members to elevate the health and wellness of their communities. To this end, ACA leads the chiropractic profession in the most constructive and far-reaching ways -- by working hand in hand with other healthcare professionals, by lobbying for pro-chiropractic legislation and policies, by supporting meaningful research and by using that research to inform treatment practices. ACA also provides professional and educational opportunities for its members and is committed to being a positive and unifying force for the practice of modern chiropractic.  Overview  The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) was founded in 1922, and in 1930 merged with the Universal Chiropractors Association to form the National Chiropractic Association (NCA). In 1963, the NCA was reorganized, once again under the title of the American Chiropractic Association. The House of Delegates (HOD), the deliberative body of the Association, is composed of 124 delegates representing all 50 states, the ACA Board of Governors, the ACA’s specialty councils, the Faculty American Chiropractic Association (FACA), the Student American Chiropractic Association (SACA) and ACA's state affiliates. The HOD meets once per year in person during the association’s annual meeting, usually held in the first quarter of the year. ACA formally recognizes 12 specialty areas of chiropractic practice through its specialty councils: * Council on Diagnostic Imaging (DACBR) * Council on Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation (the Rehab Council)(DACRB) * Council on Chiropractic Acupuncture (DABCA) * Council on Nutrition (DACBN/CBCN) * Council on Diagnosis and Internal Disorders (DABCI) * Council on Chiropractic Orthopedics (DACO/DABCO) * Council on Neurology (DACAN/DACNB/DIACN) * Chiropractic Sports Council (DACBSP) * Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics (DICCP) * Council on Occupational Health (DACBOH) * Council on Forensic Sciences (DABFP) * Council on Women's Health The official research journal of ACA is Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT), which is owned by National University of Health Sciences and published by Elsevier. Electronic access to JMPT is a membership benefit for all ACA general members. ACA also publishes a weekly e-newsletter, ACA Connects, which features news from the association and the profession, information on education programs and events, and other important updates for members. ACA endorses a number of consumer products after thorough review, analysis, testing and evaluation by a review board of doctors of chiropractic with specific and related expertise and final approval from ACA’s Board of Governors. Products are reviewed regularly to ensure they continue to meet the high standards on which the endorsement was approved. The American Chiropractic Foundation is the charitable arm of the association. The Foundation provides grants for research, education, and scholarships.  History  The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is an organizational descendant of one of the first national chiropractic membership societies, the Universal Chiropractors Association (UCA),which was established at the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1906. ACA as we know it today was founded in 1963, with the merger of the National Chiropractic Association and a splinter group from another national association. Over its history, ACA and its predecessors were responsible for establishing some of the profession's most important foundational organizations in the areas of chiropractic research and education.

The p letter of the Gothic alphabet has a cognate name, pairþra, alongside the clearly related qairþra, the name for the Gothic labiovelar. Since an influence of Ogham letter names on Gothic letter names is eminently unlikely, it seems most probable that the Proto-Germanic p rune had a meaning of ‘pear tree’ (*pera-trewô?), continued in the Anglo-Saxon peorð rune (with the meaning of the name forgotten), and was introduced into 4th century Ireland as the name of a rune named after a pear or apple tree. As p was nonexistent as a phoneme in Primitive Irish, the p and q runes would have been considered equivalent. References *Damian McManus, A Guide to Ogam, Maynooth 1991.

The Salisbury Zoo chooses to mainly house species native to North, South America, and Australia. Its collection of over 100 animals includes wallabys, American alligators, flamingos, North American river otters, ocelots, Patagonian cavies, red wolves, two-toed sloths, jaguars, llamas, turtles, macaws, rescued raptors and owls, and a spectacled or Andean bear. Admission at the Salisbury Zoo is free. History The zoo was founded in 1954 with the placement of some animals on permanent display in the city park. Improvements made in the 1970s resulted in the naturalistic enclosures for species native to North, Central, and South America that visitors see today. The zoo is currently run by a 9-member commission appointed by the mayor of Salisbury, and confirmed by the city council, and is funded partly by the Salisbury Zoo Commission, the City of Salisbury, and the nonprofit group, the Delmarva Zoological Society. The Zoo recently completed a $3 million capital campaign for an animal health clinic, a new Environmental Center, and a new exhibit of Australian animals. Oldest spectacled bears The Salisbury Zoo was home to the oldest known captive-born spectacled or Andean bear in the world, as of 2011, named Poopsie. She was born in December 1973 at the Baltimore Zoo and came to the Salisbury Zoo when she was only 7 months old, on 18 July 1974. Poopsie bore two litters of cubs in 1980 and 1981, both of which she outlived. Spectacled bears generally live to be 25–28 years old. Poopsie turned 37 on 27 December 2010. She was euthanized on 9 November 2011 following arthritic conditions, compromised mobility, and depression. The Salisbury Zoo was also home to the oldest known Andean bear, Gritto, to successfully produce offspring, when he sired a cub, Alba, born on 23 January 2015. Gritto, who was born on 28 January 1991, was euthanized on 15 October 2015 due to stroke-like symptoms.

The station programs an eclectic format similar to many other college radio stations in the United States of America, with blocks of programs featuring underground rock music, world music, folk music, occasional news, and some political or public affairs programs. The online station can be streamed at its website. History The station was formed by the largest student-run organization on campus, University Union, after a controversy involving the other student-run station, WJPZ-FM. WJPZ had incorporated as an independent entity broadcasting Top 40 music in a simulation of a professional radio station, in order to provide communications students attending the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with vocational training. It started, like WERW, as a carrier current AM station, but began broadcasting with 100 watts on 89.1 FM on February 2, 1985. WJPZ did find some favor among students at Syracuse University and amongst Top 40 fans in the surrounding community that could hear it. However, there were protests among many university students who wanted the station to reflect more \\"diverse\\" programming, including a three-day sit-in at the station's studios by the Student Afro-American Society in the autumn of 1986. The station was originally conceived in October 1986. University Union Concert Board Director Fred Feldman Creative Board Director Will Morrison and UU member Kevin Baier hatched the idea for an alternative radio station to exist under the University Union umbrella. They joined forces with SU freshmen Pete Wesenberg, Kyle Rosa, and Shane Francis, who also wanted to start a radio station. Baier became the station's first General Manager and Lori Teitler the first Music Director. The original turntables and records were those of the University Union members and its free-form format initially consisted of indie rock, rap and alternative dance music. In response to the student complaints, and with the new team in place, the University Union organization established WERW in January 1987. University Union is commonly referred to as \\"U.U.\\" and the station call letters, WERW, were chosen as shorthand for \\"We Are U.U.\\". During its first year, WERW broadcast out of the control room of CitrusTV (then UUTV) for a limited broadcasting schedule, and was heard only on cable television (WJPZ earlier had a similar arrangement). University Union secured just enough funding for turntables, a mixing console and other basic broadcast necessities and WERW moved into a \\"real\\" studio over the summer of 1987 in Watson Hall just across the hall from WJPZ. The station was originally heard only through television monitors and over low-power FM. By the early 1990s, WERW operated on carrier current at 750 AM and was available in Syracuse University's dorms and some other campus buildings. A low-power AM broadcast transmitter was acquired and an antenna was erected atop Booth Hall in 1995 to allow WERW to broadcast with 20 watts of power at 1570 AM while simulcasting on 750 AM. It could then be heard all across campus at the Syracuse University and in adjacent areas of the city of Syracuse. By the late 1990s, the carrier current broadcast at 750 AM had been abandoned. WERW began to simulcast its programming on the Web in early 2001. A few years later, the 1570 AM transmitter began to broadcast a dead carrier signal when the cable that ran from the studio to the transmitter was cut or damaged from corrosion. In early 2010, WERW split from University Union and became an independent student organization. \\"What Everyone Really Wants\\" began to be used as an alternate meaning for the call sign instead of the original meaning of \\"We Are U.U.\\" In October 2010, the station relaunched and began to broadcast from its new facilities in the basement of the Schine Student Center in the Jabberwocky Cafe. The AM transmitter was removed from the air in early 2011. In 2017, WERW returned to the airwaves on AM 1670 with a campus-only signal, but remains available online.

This eigenvalue is greater than 0 if and only if G is a connected graph. This is a corollary to the fact that the number of times 0 appears as an eigenvalue in the Laplacian is the number of connected components in the graph. The magnitude of this value reflects how well connected the overall graph is. It has been used in analysing the robustness and synchronizability of networks.  Properties  The truncated icosahedron or Buckminsterfullerene graph has a traditional connectivity of 3, and an algebraic connectivity of 0.243. The algebraic connectivity of a graph G can be positive or negative, even if G is a connected graph. Furthermore, the value of the algebraic connectivity is bounded above by the traditional (vertex) connectivity of the graph.J.L. Gross and J. Yellen. Handbook of Graph Theory, CRC Press, 2004, page 314. If the number of vertices of an undirected connected graph with nonnegative edge weights is n and the diameter is D, the algebraic connectivity is known to be bounded below by \\\\frac{1}{nD},J.L. Gross and J. Yellen. Handbook of Graph Theory, CRC Press, 2004, page 571. and in fact (in a result due to Brendan McKay) by \\\\frac{4}{nD}.Bojan Mohar, The Laplacian Spectrum of Graphs, in Graph Theory, Combinatorics, and Applications, Vol. 2, Ed. Y. Alavi, G. Chartrand, O. R. Oellermann, A. J. Schwenk, Wiley, 1991, pp. 871–898. For the example shown above, 4/18 = 0.222 ≤ 0.722 ≤ 1\\\\. Unlike the traditional connectivity, the algebraic connectivity is dependent on the number of vertices, as well as the way in which vertices are connected. In random graphs, the algebraic connectivity decreases with the number of vertices, and increases with the average degree.Synchronization and Connectivity of Discrete Complex Systems, Michael Holroyd, International Conference on Complex Systems, 2006. The exact definition of the algebraic connectivity depends on the type of Laplacian used. Fan Chung has developed an extensive theory using a rescaled version of the Laplacian, eliminating the dependence on the number of vertices, so that the bounds are somewhat different.F. Chung. Spectral Graph Theory, Providence, RI: Amer. Math. Soc., 1997. In models of synchronization on networks, such as the Kuramoto model, the Laplacian matrix arises naturally, so the algebraic connectivity gives an indication of how easily the network will synchronize.Tiago Pereira, Stability of Synchronized Motion in Complex Networks, arXiv:1112.2297v1, 2011. Other measures, such as the average distance (characteristic path length) can also be used,D. Watts, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Vintage, 2003. and in fact the algebraic connectivity is closely related to the (reciprocal of the) average distance. The algebraic connectivity also relates to other connectivity attributes, such as the isoperimetric number, which is bounded below by half the algebraic connectivity.Norman Biggs. Algebraic Graph Theory, 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp. 28 & 58.  Fiedler vector  The original theory related to algebraic connectivity was produced by Miroslav Fiedler.M. Fiedler. \\"Algebraic connectivity of Graphs\\", Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal 23(98) (1973), 298–305.M. Fiedler. \\"Laplacian of graphs and algebraic connectivity\\", Combinatorics and Graph Theory (Warsaw, 1987), Banach Center Publications 25(1) (1989), 57–70. In his honor the eigenvector associated with the algebraic connectivity has been named the Fiedler vector. The Fiedler vector can be used to partition a graph. = Partitioning a graph using the Fiedler vector = For the example graph in the introductory section, the Fiedler vector is \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0.415 & 0.309 & 0.069 & -0.221 & 0.221 & -0.794 \\\\end{pmatrix} . The negative values are associated with the poorly connected vertex 6, and the neighbouring articulation point, vertex 4; while the positive values are associated with the other vertices. The signs of the values in the Fiedler vector can therefore be used to partition this graph into two components: \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 3, 5 \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ 4, 6 \\\\\\\\} . Alternatively, the value of 0.069 (which is close to zero) can be placed in a class of its own, partitioning the graph into three components: \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 5 \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ 3 \\\\\\\\} , \\\\\\\\{ 4, 6 \\\\\\\\} .

However, each night after he comes home from work, Henry immerses himself in a world of his choosing: a baseball league in which every action is ruled by the dice. The novel opens with the excitement of a perfect game in progress. Henry, as owner of every team in the league, is flush with pride in the young rookie, who is pitching this rarest of rare games: Damon Rutherford, \\"son\\" of one of the league's all-time greats. When the young hurler completes the miracle game, Henry's life lights up. Giddy with happiness, Henry pushes himself and his league to the limits as he plays game after game so that he can see the young boy pitch again. As fate would have it, the rookie Rutherford is killed by a bean-ball, a rare play from \\"the Extraordinary Occurrences Chart\\" in the game that Henry has invented and has used to see fifty-six \\"seasons\\" to conclusion. That Henry is also fifty-six marks a turning point in Henry's life. The \\"death\\" of the young pitcher on the table-top affects the real-life Henry in ways unimaginable. As Henry's personal life spirals out of control, he finally arrives at the solution that will save his league, his creation, and, ultimately, his sanity.

It is an extension to random early detection (RED) where a single queue may have several different sets of queue thresholds. Each threshold set is associated to a particular traffic class. For example, a queue may have lower thresholds for lower priority packet. A queue buildup will cause the lower priority packets to be dropped, hence protecting the higher priority packets in the same queue. In this way quality of service prioritization is made possible for important packets from a pool of packets using the same buffer. It is more likely that standard traffic will be dropped instead of higher prioritized traffic.  Restrictions  On Cisco switches WRED is restricted to * TCP/IP traffic. Only this kind of traffic indicates congestion to the sender to enable a reduction of the transmission rate. Non-IP traffic will be dropped more often than TCP/IP traffic because it is treated with the lowest possible precedence.  Functional Description  WRED proceeds in this order when a packet arrives: * Calculation of the average queue size. * The arriving packet is queued immediately if the average queue size is below the minimum queue threshold. * Depending on the packet drop probability the packet is either dropped or queued if the average queue size is between the minimum and maximum queue threshold. * The packet is automatically dropped if the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold. = Calculation of average queue size = The average queue size depends on the previous average as well as the current size of the queue.

Immediately prior to his appointment to Hobart, D'Arcy served as the sixth Bishop of the Diocese of Sale from 1981 to 1988. Early life and education D'Arcy was born in Melbourne, and grew up in the suburb of Brighton. He was educated at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish School, Armadale; De La Salle College, Malvern; Corpus Christi College, Werribee; and the University of Melbourne, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with First Class Honours and an Exhibition in Philosophy, and a Master of Arts in Philosophy. He later pursued doctoral studies in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he was the first Australian-born philosopher to receive an Oxford doctorate, and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained as a priest in 1949, and also taught in the Philosophy Department at University of Melbourne, eventually becoming its head, and was the author of Conscience and its Right to Freedom (Sheed and Ward, 1961) and Human Acts: an essay in their moral evaluation (Clarendon Press, 1963). He also participated as translator and commentator on the 60 volume English version of Thomas Aquinas' Summa. He garnered unwanted notoriety in 1955, when a letter undersigned by him was leaked to the press confirming the existence of 'The Movement' (modelled on Catholic Action groups in Europe) within the Australian Labor Party. The resulting furore contributed to the Labor Split. Bishop of Sale and Archbishop of Hobart He became Bishop of Sale, Victoria, in 1981 before his appointment to Hobart in 1988, and was Archbishop Emeritus of Hobart from his retirement in 1999 until his death in Melbourne in 2005, aged 81.

It was produced by Jean Chalopin and Andy Heyward and created by Phil Mendez for DIC Animation City. The series was based on a half-hour NBC special called Kissyfur: Bear Roots and was followed by three more specials until its Saturday morning debut. The show ran for two seasons between 1986 to 1990. The show follows the adventures of Gus and Kissyfur, a father and son bear who had joined the circus. One day, the circus train derails and the bears escape to a new life in the swamps of Paddlecab County. There, they protect the local swamp's inhabitants from the bumbling alligators Floyd and Jolene. Kissyfur and his father use the skills they have acquired from the human world to create a boat tour business transporting other animals and their products down the river. Characters =Adults= *Gus (voiced by Ed Gilbert) - Kissyfur's widowed father, who owns a Paddlecab company, taxis animals from one side of the swamp to the other. He can be a bit goofy at times, but is a very good father. He's the only one of all the swamp parents who can take on both alligators, Floyd and Jolene, and run them off. *Miss Emmie Lou (voiced by Russi Taylor) - A blue bear who wears a flower behind one ear. She's the schoolteacher in the swamp and has a southern accent. She has a sister named Jimmie Lou and a cousin named Ernie. She's also sweet on Gus. *Charles (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) — A warthog and Lenny's father, Charles thinks he has everything figured out most of the time, but is usually more brawn than brains. *Ralph — A packrat who has a bad habit of stealing things from the residents of Paddlecab County. *Howie — A mocking bird who can throw his voice and can mimic anything and everyone. This talent often gets him into trouble. *Uncle Shelby (voiced by Frank Welker) - A wise turtle who is the elder of the swamp. *The Cackle Sisters — Two chicken sisters. One of them talks and is very prim and proper, while the other one just clucks, usually agreeing with whatever her sister says. She is referred to as Claudette. *Floyd (voiced by Stu Rosen) - An alligator who along with Jolene is always hatching a plan to capture the swamp cubs so they can eat them for dinner. He often makes dim- witted remarks. *Jolene (voiced by Terence McGovern and later Doug Parker) - An alligator who wears a red wig. She and Floyd are always trying to capture the swamp cubs so they can eat them for dinner. She would be considered the brains between the two, but not by much. She has a low tolerance for Floyd's dim-wittedness, which usually results in her smacking him with her wig. *Flo (voiced by Marilyn Lightstone) - A smug buzzard. =Swamp cubs= *Kissyfur (voiced by R.J. Williams and later Max Meier) - Gus's son and the title character of the series. He and his father used to work in a circus, along with Kissyfur's mother, who died in a performance accident. After the circus train they were in crashed, Kissyfur and his father ran into Paddlecab County and that's when they have been living since. He is an eight-year-old bear cub who loves to pretend and occasionally gets into trouble with the rest of the cubs. *Stuckey (voiced by Stu Rosen) - A purple porcupine who is very gloomy. He talks slowly and is the quiet one of the group. *Beehonie (voiced by Russi Taylor) - A white bunny who has a crush on Kissyfur, she is the only female swamp cub and tends to act as the voice of reason at times. *Duane (voiced by Neil Ross) - A pig who loves to clean and freaks out if he gets dirty. *Toot (voiced by Russi Taylor) - A six-year-old beaver, Toot is the youngest of the swamp cubs. He looks up to and idolizes Kissyfur. His nose changes from pink to black in Season 2. *Lenny (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - Charles's son, Lenny would technically be the bully of the group. He tries to act tough, though this sometimes fails if he's really scared of something. Enjoys being bossy and pushing the other cubs around. Refers to Kissyfur as \\"Sissyface\\". *Donna (voice by Russi Taylor) - Miss Emmy Lou's niece. Her only appearance is in the second special, \\"The Birds and the Bears\\".

It stars Fred Astaire as lyricist Bert Kalmar and Red Skelton as composer Harry Ruby, along with Vera- Ellen and Arlene Dahl as their wives, with Debbie Reynolds in a small but notable role as singer Helen Kane. The film, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was written by Academy-Award-winning screenwriter George Wells, directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Jack Cummings. Harry Ruby served as a consultant on the project, and he appears in a cameo role as a baseball catcher. The third in a series of MGM biopics about Broadway composers, it was preceded by Till the Clouds Roll By (Jerome Kern, 1946) and Words and Music (Rodgers and Hart, 1948) and followed by Deep in My Heart (Sigmund Romberg, 1954). Cast *Fred Astaire as Bert Kalmar *Red Skelton as Harry Ruby *Vera- Ellen as Jessie Brown *Arlene Dahl as Eileen Percy *Keenan Wynn as Charlie Kope *Gale Robbins as Terry Lordel *Gloria DeHaven as Mrs. Carter De Haven *Phil Regan as Himself *Harry Shannon as Clanahan *Debbie Reynolds as Helen Kane *Paul Harvey as Al Masters *Carleton Carpenter as Dan Healy *George Metkovich as Al Schacht *Harry Mendoza as Himself This warm and engaging film was one of Astaire's favorites, possibly because of the nostalgic vaudeville connection. As Hollywood film biographies of the period go, it takes fewer liberties with the facts than usual, and Astaire and Skelton's onscreen portrayal of the partnership is considered psychologically accurate,,complemented by a mutual chemistry, some quality acting by both, and some fine comedy touches by Skelton. Unusually for Hollywood songwriting biographies of this period, two of the songs, \\"Thinking of You\\" and \\"Nevertheless\\", became major hits on the film's release, reaching first and second place respectively, in the U.S. charts. In recognition of his acting performance, Fred Astaire was awarded the first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in 1951. Key songs/dance routines This film provides an object lesson in how to integrate the many songs and dances seamlessly and naturally into the script \\\\- a principle first introduced into the Hollywood musical by Astaire as far back as 1934. Astaire's choreography takes the opportunity provided by Vera-Ellen's technical prowess to showcase dance routines notable for leg kicks, lifts and - Astaire's innovative combination of the two - the hurdling lift, first invented for \\"The Yam\\" number in Carefree (1938). These routines are contrasted with some choreographically primitive numbers typical of vaudeville c. 1920. The spirit of the partnered dances expands on the theme of marital contentment previously explored in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939) and the prior year's The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Vera-Ellen's singing voice was dubbed by Anita Ellis. * \\"Where Did You Get That Girl?\\": Astaire and Vera-Ellen, dressed in top hat, white tie and tails, impersonate the vaudeville partnership of Kalmar and Brown with this genial song and dance duet set around 1919. (The song itself dates to 1913 and was written by Kalmar and an earlier partner, Harry Puck, before the lyricist teamed with Ruby.) Fred and Adele Astaire had greatly admired the Kalmar-Brown partnership: \\"We used to stand in the wings and watch Jessie and Bert with thrilled envy, wondering if we could equal their finesse and reach their headline billing\\". The routine is very straightforward, and when contrasted with the creations of Astaire, Gene Kelly and others, illustrates the profound evolution popular dance had undergone in the intervening period. Incidentally Ruby, working as a song plugger, had once played tunes for the Astaire siblings. * \\"Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer At Home\\": A hectic and high-kicking comic dance duet for Astaire and Vera-Ellen which is set in a suburban family living room and portrays the various challenges of contented domesticity. The routine, which, in contrast to the previous one, is thoroughly modern in conception, is nonetheless shown performed at the Keith's Theatre (which later became the K in RKO) in Washington, D.C. in the presence of President Woodrow Wilson, a noted vaudeville fan. * \\"My Sunny Tennessee\\": Astaire and Skelton deliver a version of this 1921 hit. * \\"So Long, OO-Long\\": Kalmar and Ruby's 1920 Oriental-themed ditty is performed by Astaire and Skelton. * \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\": This 1923 Kalmar and Ruby standard was sung by Gloria DeHaven. * \\"Test Solo\\": Danced by Astaire, initially to a spare piano accompaniment by André Previn and then to the music of \\"Where Did You Get That Girl?\\". This was his fifth tap and cane solo, the first being \\"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\\" from Top Hat (1935), followed by \\"I Can't Be Bothered Now\\" from A Damsel in Distress (1937), the \\"Audition Dance\\" from You Were Never Lovelier (1942), and \\"Puttin' On The Ritz\\" from Blue Skies (1946), - all remarkably dissimilar in execution. In the beginning of the solo, Astaire places his hat on top of a light stand and then waves to it. One year later, in \\"Sunday Jumps\\" from Royal Wedding (1951) he would take a clotheshorse into his arms and dance with it. * \\"Come On Papa\\": Another high-kicking song and dance routine, this time for Vera-Ellen and chorus of sailors, to a 1918 song by Ruby and Edgar Leslie. * \\"Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)\\": Kalmar and Ruby's 1931 song is performed on stage by Astaire and Vera-Ellen to Skelton's piano accompaniment. * \\"All Alone Monday\\": Gale Robbins delivers a performance of Kalmar and Ruby's 1926 ballad. * \\"I Wanna Be Loved by You\\": Debbie Reynolds, in one of her earliest film appearances, performs this 1928 number with Carleton Carpenter, with Reynolds dubbed by the original boop-boop-a-doop girl Helen Kane (uncredited). * \\"Thinking of You\\": One of the dance highlights of the film is this romantic partnered routine for Astaire and Vera-Ellen, which follows after Ellen's (dubbed) performance of this 1927 standard. The dance begins quietly and affectionately in a lounge area, and gradually builds becoming progressively more extrovert until the music changes into a rumba - the Latin dance of love - and Astaire embarks on a further exploration of the possibilities of blending Latin and ballroom dance styles, which he had first been inspired to undertake during his celebrated partnership with Rita Hayworth. After this departure - which illustrates the passion than can continue to flourish long after the married nuptials - the dance subsides into a tender coda, recalling its opening mood. * \\"I Love You So Much\\": Arlene Dahl, accompanied by a chorus of top-hatted men, sings and dances her way through this number originally written for the 1930 film version of The Ramblers (later retitled The Cuckoos). * \\"Medley (incl. Three Little Words)\\": In this closing scene, Astaire and Skelton perform a medley of most of the songs featured in the film, ending with \\"Three Little Words\\" - Kalmar having finally found a suitable lyric for Ruby's melody, a running gag throughout most of the film. Contemporary reviews *The New York Times, August 10, 1950: \\"There is a special quality about the new picture...which deserves immediate mention in detail. That is the polished performance of Fred Astaire as Bert Kalmar... Mr. Astaire has been wearing out thin-soled dancing shoes at a great pace over the years while most of us have grown a little heavier and somewhat slower of foot. But, he hasn't changed. Still lithe in appearance, Mr. Astaire has drawn rich dividends from time and is dancing in peak form...In talking of the fine dancing contributed by Mr. Astaire we forgot to mention how engagingly they carry off the romantic interest and bust into song when the script demands it.\\" *Variety, July 12, 1950: Stal.:\\"For Astaire, it's unquestionably his best picture in sometime. His terping, as always, is tops, his singing is adequate and his characterisation of Kalmar, while never deeply-etched, does full justice to the late songwriter's many talents...Vera-Ellen, with this picture, becomes the undisputed premiere danseuse of the screen. She matches Astaire tap for tap...and looks to be the best partner he's ever had.\\" Box office According to MGM records the film earned $3,019,000 in the US and Canada and $1,507,000 elsewhere, resulting in a healthy profit of $1,252,000.

The storm formed in late September when it moved westward and peaked in intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) to weaken slightly by time of landfall on September 29 with recorded wind speeds of 126 mph (206 km/h) as a strong category 3 Hurricane. The hurricane killed 275 people and caused $13 million (1915 US dollars) in damage. Meteorological history According to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, the 1915 New Orleans hurricane began as a weak tropical storm moving across the southern Windward Islands on September 21, 1915. Its tropical cyclogenesis was determined via analysis of atmospheric observations from the surrounding islands, though shipping in the region would confirm the storm's existence the following day. Tracking slowly towards the west, the nascent tropical cyclone gradually strengthened, reaching hurricane intensity by 00:00 UTC on September 23\\\\. This steady phase of intensification would continue unhindered as the hurricane progressed across the Caribbean Sea, allowing the storm to reach major hurricane strength on September 24\\\\. At 12:00 UTC the next day, the cyclone's maximum sustained winds crested at 145 mph (230 km/h), making it a powerful Category 4 hurricane if rated using the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm would maintain winds of this scale for over three days. One ship observation, estimated to have been likely taken late on September 25, documented a barometric pressure of 931 mbar (hPa; 27.50 inHg). This pressure reading would stand as the lowest taken during the hurricane's lifespan, and also suggested that the storm's initially assessed intensity—equivalent to a modern-day Category 2 hurricane—was significantly underestimated. As the cyclone passed south of Jamaica, it curved towards the northwest, taking it towards the Yucatán Channel. By September 28, the storm had entered the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane maintained its gradual forward speed and fairly steady intensity as it approached the Louisiana coast. As the cyclone neared land, it entered a denser area of shipping traffic, allowing the storm's intensity to be more readily assessed. Slight weakening occurred as the storm moved over shallower continental shelf waters, leading up to the hurricane's landfall on the Gulf coast of Louisiana at 18:00 UTC on September 29\\\\. The hurricane's strongest winds upon landfall were estimated to measure 125 mph (200 km/h), correlating with the upper-end of a Category 3 rating on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Near the time of landfall, the hurricane was documented as having a central pressure of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.12 inHg) at Tulane University. At the time, this was the lowest pressure ever recorded in the United States. Using this measurement, the Atlantic reanalysis project calculated that the hurricane struck Louisiana with a lower pressure: 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg). Analysis of onshore observations also suggested that the storm made landfall with concentric eyewalls. Although the moist swampland of the Louisianan Acadiana allowed the hurricane to maintain strength longer than what would otherwise be expected, the storm would eventually succumb to land interaction. Rapid weakening ensued as the cyclone moved inland, degrading back into a tropical storm within twelve hours of landfall. As it entered Mississippi, the storm began to interact with a quasi- stationary front. This resulted in the formation of a new low-pressure center and denoted the transition from a tropical to extratropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC on September 30; and these remnants advanced northeastward into the Mid- Atlantic states before they were last noted on October 1 over Pennsylvania. Caribbean impacts Owing to the scarcity of shipping traffic across much of the Caribbean Sea, the storm's intensity and potential track were difficult to assess early in its lifetime. Light rain from the system fell far north in Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands, with the latter reporting 0.23 in (6 mm) of rain. As the storm passed south of Jamaica, strong gales were felt in Kingston, Jamaica. Some winds were strong enough to cut telecommunications between Kingston and the outlying districts of the island nation. The hurricane's brushing of Jamaica led in part to raising cotton prices to a yearly high. Offshore, the United Fruit steamer Almirante sustained considerable damage but was able to return safely to Port Royal. Ships sailing for the Yucatán Channel and in western Cuban waters were warned to exercise extreme caution following the hurricane's passage of Jamaica. Winds peaked at 36 mph (58 km/h) in Havana, Cuba as the storm passed through the channel well to the city's west. United States impacts =Preparations= As potential impacts on the United States became more clear, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for virtually the entire extent of the Eastern Seaboard from Eastport, Maine southward to the Florida coast on September 27. Storm warnings for the Louisiana coast—where the hurricane would eventually make landfall—were first issued by the Weather Bureau on the morning of September 28 and disseminated via telegraph and mail. That afternoon, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico from Pensacola, Florida to New Orleans, Louisiana. Extensive efforts to communicate the imminent threat the hurricane posed began in earnest following the issuance of warnings for the area, with public interests being advised that the approaching storm could be stronger than the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane, which served as New Orleans' strongest documented tropical cyclone at the time. Warnings continued into September 29, and local emergency offices enforced strict curfews for New Orleans as landfall approached; meteorologist Isaac Cline stated in an entry to the Monthly Weather Review that the effective dissemination of warnings and strict enforcement of curfew \\"unquestionably\\" mitigated additional loss of life in the city. =Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana= As the hurricane traversed the Gulf of Mexico from September 28 to September 29, it produced rough surf along its path. The cutter Miami was caught in the storm, but was able to use a heavily damaged ship as an anchor before resuming its trek towards Key West, Florida. Storm surge and rough seas produced by the hurricane along the Louisiana coast arrived shortly before the storm made landfall. Evacuees departing the coast as late as September 28 reported no abnormal tides along the shore. However, sea levels began to rise at abnormally rapid rates on the morning of September 29 as the hurricane neared. By the afternoon hours, low-lying lands south of New Orleans and east towards Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, as well as areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain, were inundated by the quickly rising storm surge. Levee overtopping along Lake Pontchartrain resulted in the flooding of much of western New Orleans. Parts of Carrollton, New Orleans were submerged under as much as 8 ft (2.4 m) of water due to the levee failure, and much of this inundation remained for up to four days as the city's drainage system slowly drained the floodwaters; in other locations, floodwaters receded rapidly. At its height, the surge was estimated to have crested between 15–20 ft (4.6–6.1 m) in height, setting a record for the highest tide reported in the region. Ocean swells topped levees along the Mississippi River and progressed well upstream; at the confluence of the Harvey Canal and the Mississippi River nearly 100 mi (160 km) from the Gulf of Mexico, the river swelled to 6 ft (1.8 m) above normal. Elsewhere, waves 10–12 ft (3.0–3.7 m) above normal high tide were reported along the same river. Upon making landfall, onshore anemometers documented winds stronger than had been recorded in any previous hurricane along the United States Gulf Coast. Gusts as high as 130 mph (210 km/h) were reported in New Orleans, with five-minute sustained winds peaking at 86 mph (138 km/h). In Burrwood, Louisiana, a Weather Bureau anemometer documented peak five-minute sustained windspeeds of 122 mph (196 km/h), though when the abnormally high bias of the era's anemometers and adjustment to the more standard one-minute sustained measure are accounted for, this yields a speed of 99 mph (159 km/h). The intense winds caused extensive damage across New Orleans, where nearly every building sustained damage. The French Market was partly demolished, while the roof of a prominent Masonic temple partially collapsed. Combined with powerful waves, the winds resulted in the sinking of four small steamers at the Port of New Orleans, in addition to several coal barges. A number of other steamers and small craft were blown from bayous and bays onto dry land. The winds also caused widespread power outages, cutting telecommunications to and from the city, and putting over 8000 telephones out of commission. Electric lighting was also disabled by the storm following the failure of city's power station. Damage to city-owned property in New Orleans was appraised at nearly US$500,000, though the total amount of damage to all public and private property in the city was estimated to have been at least ten times greater at US$5 million. Damage to shipping along the Mississippi River in and around New Orleans was estimated at US$1.75 million. Following the storm's passage, rail service to New Orleans was suspended. Roofs were blown off buildings and the Presbytère on Jackson Square losing its cupola. The clock on St. Louis Cathedral stopped at 5:50pm, the height of the storm. The hurricane damaged the Times-Picayune building, hampering newspaper production. More church steeples in the city were blown down or significantly damaged than remained intact. First Presbyterian Church on Lafayette Square, destroyed by the great hurricane of 1915, collapsing at 5:02pm.http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/plaquemines/history/hurc1915.txt The hurricane also caused significant damage in areas around New Orleans, including the destruction of 90% of buildings destroyed along Lake Pontchartrain. Only one house remained standing in Leeville, Louisiana; similar destruction occurred between Golden Meadow, Louisiana and Cut Off, Louisiana, where 100 houses were demolished. In Morgan City, Louisiana, winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) blew down wires and crippled communication. The total damage to infrastructure in areas surrounding New Orleans was estimated at US$6.5 million. The heaviest rain fell within an area 25 mi (40 km) east of the center, though heavy rainfall occurred throughout the eastern half of the tropical cyclone as it moved inland. Franklin, Louisiana measured the highest rainfall associated with the storm with a reading of 14.43 in (36.7 cm); on September 30, 10.28 in (26.1 cm) of rain fell in Franklin, setting a September 24-hour rainfall record for the city. Precipitation spread ahead of the hurricane as it interacted with a stationary front draped over the Southeastern United States, causing widespread rainfall totals in excess of 3 in (8 cm) across much of Mississippi and Alabama. A storm surge rolled into St. Bernard Parish, the Rigolets, and the Lake Catherine area. Areas along the Lower Coast (south of New Orleans) were hit even harder than the city. A telegraph report states the situation: > Whole country between Poydras and Buras inundated. Levees gone, property > loss appalling. Life toll probably heavy. Conditions estimated worse than > ever before. Relief needed. No communications... There were 23 dead in Venice, Louisiana, with similar numbers in coastal towns of Frenier and LaBranche. Plaquemines Parish experienced the worst fatalities with deaths estimated at over 200; the bodies of some victims were never found. In Plaquemines Parish, there was severe flooding and miles of levees were washed away. Thousands of people were left homeless. The hurricane also wrecked many of the oyster boats, damaging the local economy. Some communities, including Breton Island and the town of Saint Malo were completely destroyed. Though it was not as deadly as the 1893 Chenier Caminanda hurricane, this hurricane was the deadliest Louisiana hurricane until Betsy 50 years later. =Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi= Early reports that streets in Biloxi, Mississippi were inundated under 6 ft (1.8 m) were initially denied by Louisville and Nashville Railroad dispatchers. Mobile, Alabama did not experience significant damage as winds remained under 50 mph (80 km/h), though storm surge A local train carrying relief supplies from Mobile was sent to affected areas, though most train service in the region was suspended.

In the mathematical field of knot theory, a 2-bridge knot is a knot which can be regular isotoped so that the natural height function given by the z-coordinate has only two maxima and two minima as critical points. Equivalently, these are the knots with bridge number 2, the smallest possible bridge number for a nontrivial knot. Other names for 2-bridge knots are rational knots', 4-plats, and ''''' (). 2-bridge links are defined similarly as above, but each component will have one min and max. 2-bridge knots were classified by Horst Schubert, using the fact that the 2-sheeted branched cover of the 3-sphere over the knot is a lens space. The names rational knot and rational link were coined by John Conway who defined them as arising from numerator closures of rational tangles.

It is a complex mountain, taking the form of a flat summit plateau from which five ridges radiate, and is most famed for the cliffs surrounding the corrie of Coire Ardair on the north-eastern face. These crags are a renowned venue for winter and ice climbing, although being somewhat vegetated they are less suited to summer climbing. The name Creag Meagaidh is also applied to refer to the neighbouring peaks of Stob Poite Coire Ardair and Càrn Liath which together may be termed the Creag Meagaidh range. All three peaks in the range may be climbed from Aberarder on the A86 road by initially following the path leading up Coire Ardair, before striking north to the summit of Càrn Liath. A circuit of the glen may be made by returning to Aberarder by way of Creag Meagaidh's east ridge. The most direct route to the summit of Creag Meagaidh ascends from the head of the corrie to reach a narrow gap between the crags known as The Window. The Window forms the bealach between Creag Meagaidh and Stob Poite Coire Ardair. Creag Meagaidh may also be climbed from Moy to the southeast. Creag Meagaidh massif is part of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve (NNR). The reserve covers 3,940 hectares, extending from the shores of Loch Laggan to the high summit plateau of Creag Meagaidh. The reserve was designated in 1986 and is owned and managed by NatureScot. Creag Meagaidh is also designated as a Special Protection Area, and the number of grazing animals is controlled. This has led to a regrowth of the native woodland of birch, alder, willow, rowan and oak. The site is also an important breeding ground for many species of birds, in particular the dotterel Charadrius morinellus. Nature and conservation =Flora and fauna= A number of nationally important plant species can be found at Creag Meagaidh, including woolly willow, wavy meadow grass, highland saxifrage, bog orchid and Scots pine. Over 120 species of lichen have also been recorded.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 10. The summit of the massif is carpeted in moss heath and stiff sedge, being one of the largest areas of woolly fringemoss heath in the UK.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 10. The cliffs above Coire Ardair have mostly avoided grazing and support a number of rare species such as alpine foxtail, alpine lady-fern, Norwegian cudweed , downy willow and sibbaldia. Over 150 species of invertebrates have been recorded on the summit plateau. This number include rarities such as the large wolf spider, which within Scotland is found only on one or two of the highest summits. One species of fly that has been identified at Creag Meagaidh, Spilogona trigonata, is not found anywhere else in Britain, being generally restricted to Scandinavia and North America.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 13. According to NatureScot, 137 different bird species have been recorded within the Reserve.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 11. Of these, one particular species of note is the dotterel, which is one of Britain's rarest birds: the upper part of the mountain (above 750 m) is consequently designated as a Special Protection Area for this species. Snow bunting and golden plover also breed on the higher heaths and summit plateau, while red grouse and greenshank are often seen on the lower slopes. The denser woodland on the lower part of the reserve also provides a home for chaffinch, willow warbler, tree pipit and wren.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 12. There are three species of deer found at Creag Meagaidh NNR: red, roe and sika. Deer management to reduce numbers takes place at Creag Meagaidh in order to facilitate woodland regeneration. Mountain hares are common on the higher parts of the reserve, whilst pine marten and otter can occasionally be found at lower altitudes. There has been only one sighting of the Scottish wildcat in recent years. =Conservation designations= Creag Meagaidh has several overlapping conservation designations, testament to its diverse range of habitats and important features: it is a National Nature Reserve (NNR), a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protection Area (SPA) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. History The earliest historical records for Creag Meagaidh are from the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when the area was farmed by tenants who grew crops on the lower slopes and grazed cattle on the higher ground during the summer. Following the Jacobite rising of 1745 the then owner, Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, was deprived of his estate, which was then managed on behalf of the Crown by the Commissioners for Forfeited Estates. The commission began the process of evicting the tenants and consolidating the holdings into a single sheep farm, and by 1790 there were around 20,000 sheep in the parish of Laggan. In 1784 Creag Meagaidh was restored to the Macpherson family.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 15. The first recorded ascent of Creag Meagaidh is thought to have been made in 1786 by Thomas Thornton, who described the view from the summit in his book, \\"Sporting Tour\\".Ian R Mitchell, Scotland's Mountains Before the Mountaineers, p. 71-74. Published 2013, Luath Press. By the early twentieth century the estate was being managed for sporting interests (deer stalking, fishing and grouse shooting), alongside sheep farming and forestry. The construction of the Laggan Dam (completed 1934) as part of the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme led to a reduction in the amount of grazing land in the area, causing an increase in deer numbers at Creag Meagaidh. By the 1970s sheep farming had largely ceased, and deer stalking had become the main activity on the estate. In 1983 the estate was sold to Fountain Forestry, who proposed to plant much of the area with Sitka spruce plantations. There was public opposition to this plan, and in 1985 the estate was sold to the Nature Conservancy Council (predecessor to NatureScot), who declared the area a national nature reserve in 1986.The Story of Creag Meagaidh National Nature Reserve. p. 16.

The album was originally a collection of demos recorded in 1992-1993 to be submitted to their label, Atlantic Records. The demo tracks were released posthumously on December 15, 1998 in Japan on Pony Canyon. A European release on UK-based Z Records, with different artwork, followed in 2000. The song \\"Lord Knows\\" was originally written and demoed for the first Badlands record, but ultimately left off the album. The song \\"The River\\" was re-recorded by Greg Chaisson for his 1994 solo album It's About Time with Rob Lamothe of the Riverdogs on lead vocals. Guitarist Jake E. Lee would re-use the main riff in \\"Sun Red Sun\\" for the song \\"Blood Provider\\" and the main riff in \\"Walking Attitude\\" for the song \\"The Key\\", demoed with his post-Badlands group, Wicked Alliance, which featured World War III vocalist Mandy Lion and future Korn drummer Ray Luzier. After leaving Badlands and moving back to the East Coast, vocalist Ray Gillen joined New York-based all-star band Sun Red Sun, which he named after the Badlands song. Album notes In an interview on the Racer X website, drummer Jeff Martin talked about the making of Dusk: \\"Dusk, or the tunes put on the album, were intended as demos for the next Badlands album after Voodoo Highway. We had worked up that group of tunes at rehearsals at Mates in North Hollywood two months before recording them at Goodnight L.A by a friend of Ray's, Shay Baby. It's all 24-track full studio recording, but we did it all in less than 6 to 8 hours. We put the mics up, made sure they worked and Go!\\" \\"We recorded them primarily for Atlantic Records to hear and give us a budget for the full recording of the same tunes, if they liked what we had. They did not like the direction of the songs, for whatever the reason. Some months later we were dropped from Atlantic. At the time we were happy with that outcome and so was the management, being that Atlantic was not doing anything for us anyway. We shopped new prospects. Almost every song was one-take recordings. I remember having floor tom mic problems where we stopped to fix it, then re-started a song. But all in all, one takes. Even some endings were a little funky on my end, but Jake just flagged it off and we go to the next tune. I think Jake is the only one who did not make one mistake... if he did I did not hear it. Ray had about 50% of his lyrics together. The rest were what he called Jib-A-Jab. He would put a word or two on the front of a line and rest were all vowels. He was amazing at it, and most folks never could tell the difference. He would come up with his melody line by Jib-A-Jabbing. I think he had a harder time finding lyrics that fit his Jabbing, due to the timing and the percussive hooks he would come up with while scatting along. Nothing on Dusk was fixed, that Ray did, obviously due to his passing before the putting together of the tracks. For him to sound like what you hear on the album one take each tune, still amazes me to no end. He was one you could say had true talent, pitch and tone.\\" Track listing All tracks by Ray Gillen and Jake E.

He served as a pilot and commander, and was the first officer of the RAF to be awarded the DSO three times during the Second World War. He flew over a hundred sorties and distinguished himself in a variety of operations requiring coolness under fire. Some consider Pickard of the same calibre as Guy Gibson and Leonard Cheshire. In 1941 he participated in the making of the 1941 wartime film Target for To-night, which made him a public figure in England. He led the squadron of Whitley bombers that carried paratroopers to their drop for the Bruneval raid. Throughout 1943 he flew the Lysander on nighttime missions into occupied France for the SOE, performing insertions of agents and picking up personnel from very small landing strips. Pickard led a group of Mosquitos on the Amiens raid, in which he was killed in action 18 February 1944. Background Pickard was born in Handsworth, Sheffield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England and was educated at Framlingham College. Academically he did not excel, but was a skilled equestrian and shot. Pickard was the son of the late P. C. Pickard and Mrs. J. Pickard. He was the youngest of two boys and three girls. His sister was actress Helena Pickard, married to English actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke. She gave birth to the actor Edward Hardwicke, Dr Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame who also served in the RAF as a pilot during his national service. During the 1930s, Pickard spent some time living on a ranch in Kenya. He enjoyed hiking in the African bush and indulged his passion for riding horses and shooting. At the same time he discovered polo, a sport he quickly became skilled at. His first taste of service came when he enlisted in the King's African Rifles as a reservist. Unfortunately, Pickard contracted malaria but recovered and returned to England. Service history After Pickard failed to qualify as an army officer, he was accepted and received a short service commission into the Royal Air Force in January 1937, which was made Permanent in November. After successfully passing his flight training with an 'above average' rating, he was posted to 214 Squadron, flying the Handley Page Harrow. His skill as a pilot was soon noticed, and he was appointed personal assistant to the air officer commanding a training group at Cranwell in 1938. He participated in fighting over Norway, France and during the Dunkirk evacuation. He married Dorothy at this time, despite her family's misgivings.http://www.rafcommands.com/database/wardead/details.php?qnum=35925 During the Battle of Britain while serving as a flight lieutenant in No. 99 Squadron, Pickard flew the Vickers Wellington in raids on Germany, where he began to work with his longtime navigator Flt Sgt Alan Broadley. Involved with early leaflet dropping sorties during the phony war, Pickard flew alongside Jack Grisman of Great Escape fame. While posted to 99, Pickard also flew six missions with David Holford, who served as co-pilot. He rated Holford as a talented pilot. On 19 June 1940 while on the return from a raid, he was forced to ditch his flak damaged Wellington in the English Channel. He and his crew survived and were picked up by a lifeboat shortly afterwards. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in July 1940. He was promoted to squadron leader with No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron and was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in March 1941. Pickard was drafted in to the squadron to improve performance and bring the unit up to operational standards. Preferring an informal approach, he was often seen wearing cowboy boots with his uniform and accompanied by his sheepdog Ming. As an officer, Pickard was mild mannered, approachable and humourous but determined in the face of action, leading him to be popular with his men. He was awarded the Czechoslovak War Cross in 1941. Target for Tonight right Pickard appeared as Squadron Leader Dickson in the RAF propaganda film Target for Tonight, released in July 1941. The plot concerned a Wellington bomber, F for Freddie taking part in a night time raid over Germany which is damaged during its return flight to England. Pickard was initially reluctant to appear. The film was produced by the Royal Air Force Film Production Unit and directed by Harry Watt. It was seen as a way to encourage people to join the service. It was a box office hit and won an Academy Award in 1942. Watt later expressed regret that most of the people featured in the film did not survive the war. Special operations In May 1942, as wing commander in charge of No. 51 Squadron based at RAF Dishforth, he was awarded a bar to the DSO in recognition of his leadership in Operation Biting (also known as the Bruneval raid) on 27 February 1942. Pickard's role was to fly in and allow members of the British 1st Airborne Division to parachute behind enemy lines from a Whitley bomber to capture and retrieve a Wurzburg radar installation. The raid was a complete success. After the raid, the King and Queen visited Dishforth. Upon asking why there were two footprints on the ceiling of the mess, Pickard with total honesty explained that the post raid party had led to hi-jinks and the footprints were his. Pickard pictured in 1942. =No. 161 Squadron missions= October 1942 saw Pickard posted to No. 161 Squadron. In March 1943, while commanding 161 – which carried out operations in support of the SOE in occupied Europe – at RAF Tempsford he was awarded a second bar to the DSO for outstanding leadership ability and fine fighting qualities. Flying Westland Lysanders, he was involved in flying British agents and supplies both in and out of occupied Europe on behalf of the SOE alongside Hugh Verity. Pickard had a talented team of pilots under his command, including Frank Rymills, Peter Vaughan-Fowler and Jim McCairns.Verity (2002), various Pickard specialised in 'moonlight operations,' flying spies and materiel on a night of the full moon. On one flight in November 1942 he did not receive the expected signal from the ground so that he could land, and had to flee when attacked by two Luftwaffe fighters. Using the Lysander's superior handling and slower speed, Pickard managed to escape back to England despite being repeatedly fired upon and chased across the English Channel. On another occasion, he rescued seven agents and managed to take off despite the agents being closely hunted by the Gestapo. One of the agents Pickard worked with was Henri Déricourt, who was suspected in some quarters of being a double agent, although he was later acquitted.Helm, p 33 Jim McCairns, Hugh Verity, Pickard, Peter Vaughan-Fowler and Bunny Rymills with Verity's Lysander in 1943. =Hudson flights= Working with Verity, the two pushed for the Lockheed Hudson to be introduced for SOE work to give greater flexibility and be able to transport more passengers then the Lysander could offer. The two men then worked out the logistics of operating the Hudson from the French fields which were still Nazi occupied. The Hudson went into operational service with 161 on 13 February 1943. The first mission, flown by Pickard delivered five agents into France. In all, the Hudson flew 36 successful sorties without loss, delivering 139 agents and extracting 221, although several early fights in early 1943 saw Pickard operating with his wrist in a plaster cast, the result of more riotous parties in the mess hall. A sortie to pick up two operatives led to Pickard's aircraft to become stuck in mud on landing. It took the three men with help from several people in a local village to free the aircraft for take off, but the mission led to Pickard being awarded a second bar to his DSO, making him the first RAF officer in the Second World War to be awarded as such.K. R. M. Short, ‘Pickard, Percy Charles (1915–1944)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2008, . Retrieved on 5 November 2008 Pickard recommended one of his pilots, Flt Lt Geoffrey Osborn be recommended for the George Medal after Osborn's aircraft crashed and he single handedly rescued several members of his crew from the burning plane. Osborn was given the award. During the early planning for Operation Chastise, Guy Gibson sought Pickard's help to plan the route for the mission. 617 Squadron's commander valued Pickard's knowledge and experience, and he was able to provide Gibson with details of the position of the German flak batteries. This proved invaluable and allowed Gibson to plot a course that avoided the majority of the flak posts. No. 140 Wing For a while Pickard was station commander at RAF Sculthorpe. In October 1943 he was given command of No. 140 Wing of the Second Tactical Air Force by Basil Embry. This put him in charge of three squadrons of de Havilland Mosquito fast bombers. They became specialised in low level precision attacks.Heroes of the Skies Michael Ashcroft On 3 October, Pickard led 12 Mosquitos on an attack against the Pont Chateau power station. The power station was badly damaged and all 12 aircraft returned to base safely. When Leonard Cheshire was trying to convince his superiors to use the de Havilland Mosquito as a low level marking aircraft to assist 617 Squadron, he approached Pickard for help. Cheshire had just taken command of the Dambusters, who were in a slump after their success with the Ruhr dams raid and the departure of Gibson.http://www.dambusters.org.uk/war-personalities/leaders/geoffrey- leonard-cheshire/ On 19 December 1943, Cheshire visited Pickard and the two men went over the merits of the aircraft. Pickard took Cheshire up for a short test flight to demonstrate how good the Mosquito was. Impressed, he was eventually able to obtain the Mosquito for his squadron's use and it was used to good effect, initially with Cheshire flying as the marking pilot. =Amiens Raid= No. 140 Wing was tasked with Operation Jericho. Embry was initially earmarked in to lead the raid, but he stepped aside. This allowed Pickard to take command of 18 February 1944 low-level attack on the Amiens Prison, despite having limited experience with low level operations Each Mosquito squadron was to have an escort of one Hawker Typhoon squadron, 174 Squadron and 245 Squadron from RAF Westhampnett and a squadron provided by Air Defence of Great Britain (the part of Fighter command not transferred to the 2nd Tactical Air Force) from RAF Manston. The attack was carried out at the request of the French resistance in order to allow a considerable number of their imprisoned members, who were soon to be executed by the occupying Nazis, the chance to escape. The Resistance stated that the prisoners had said they would rather take the chance of being killed by RAF bombs than be shot by the Nazis. 487 Squadron Mosquitos over Amiens Prison as their bombs explode, showing the snow-covered buildings and landscape. At the end of the mission briefing, Pickard was quoted as saying 'It's a death or glory job, boys.' The whole mission was flown at tree top height, with precision bombing required. Operation Jericho was a success; the prison walls were breached and prison buildings and guards' barracks were destroyed. Of the 832 prisoners, 102 were killed by the bombing, 74 were wounded and 258 escaped, however two-thirds of the escapees were later recaptured. =Aftermath= Pickard, together with his Navigator, Flight Lieutenant J. A. \\"Bill\\" Broadley, were killed when their Mosquito, HX922/\\"EG-F\\", was shot down by a Fw 190 flown by Feldwebel Wilhelm Mayer of 7. Staffel Jagdgeschwader 26 in the closing stages of the operation. Pickard and Broadley were initially reported missing and then in September 1944 it was announced that they had been 'killed in action'. Pickard is buried in plot 3, row B, grave 13 at St Pierre Cemetery near Amiens, France.Casualty details—Pickard, Percy Charles, Casualty details—Broadley, John Alan, Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved on 5 November 2008. Broadley is buried in plot 3, row A, grave 11 of the same cemetery. Pickard's death left Dorothy to bring up their young son on her own. The French government called for him to receive a posthumous Victoria Cross.'Operation Jericho', BBC (TV), 20 October 2011 Lord Londonderry advocated for Pickard to receive the award, however Basil Embry declined to support this, stating that the Amiens raid was a standard operation and did not warrant it. He felt that Pickard's other awards justified the decision for him to not receive the VC. The French also sought to award Pickard the Légion d’Honneur and the Croix de Guerre, but this was not permitted as British policy did not allow acceptance of posthumous awards from foreign countries. Pickard's family have continued to petition to allow the awards. No. 140 Wing went on to perform a similar low level raid, Operation Carthage, destroying Gestapo Headquarters in Copenhagen on 21 March 1945. The 1969 motion picture Mosquito Squadron is partially based on the Operation Jericho raid.

Combs, who statistically has drawn comparisons to pitcher John Keefe, attended Hastings High School in Houston, Texas and later attended Baylor University, where he had a 3.8 grade point average in 1988. Baseball career Combs was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round (11th overall) of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft. He had one \\"golden\\" season — that being his first professional year. In 1989, Combs had reached every level of professional baseball, from A-ball to the big leagues. For the Class A Clearwater Phillies, he went 2-1 with a 1.30 earned run average (ERA) in 6 games. For the Double-A Reading Phillies, Combs went 8-7 with a very respectable 3.38 ERA in 19 games. For the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, he went 3-0 with a 0.37 ERA. Continuing with the Phillies, Combs went 4-0 with a 2.09 ERA in 6 games. Taking his success into consideration, the next year the Phillies placed Combs in the starting rotation. However, he was not able to maintain his streak. Combs went 10-10 with 4.07 ERA, with 86 walks and only 108 strikeouts. His performance continued to deteriorate, as Combs‘ ERA jumped to 7.71, in his final MLB season. Two times in Combs‘ major league career, his walks yielded exceeded his strikeouts posted: In 1991, Combs walked 43 and struck out 41; in 1992 he walked 12 and struck out 11.

Muireadach gained the Mormaerdom by challenging the rights of the current Mormaer, his elder brother, also called Muireadhach, hence Muireadhch Mór (in English, \\"the elder\\"). The case apparently went to arbitration, and the king decided on the right of Muireadhch Óg. On 13 December 1213, Muireadhach Mór resigned the Mormaerdom, taking lesser lands and titles in compensation. Muireadhach Óg was one of the seven mormaers present at the coronation of King Alexander II of Scotland in 1214, and Muireadhach accompanied the king in the funeral cortège of his father and predecessor, King William of Scotland. Muireadhach Óg appears again in the company of the king in 1224, when he appears on a charter issued at Stirling granting rights to Paisley Abbey. In a document dating to 1226, Muireadach is referred to as \\"Sheriff of Stirling\\". He had no legitimate sons, but two daughters, Isabella (Iosbail), who married a Comyn, and Maria (Màire), who married a Stewart; both became countesses in their own right. Muireadach died before January 1234, when his successor appears with the comital title for the first time.

Blagden won the Copley Medal in 1788 and was knighted in 1792. He died in Arcueil, France in 1820, and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Science In June 1783, Blagden, then assistant to Henry Cavendish, visited Antoine Lavoisier in Paris and described how Cavendish had created water by burning \\"inflammable air\\". Lavoisier's dissatisfaction with the Cavendish's \\"dephlogistinization\\" theory led him to the concept of a chemical reaction, which he reported to the Royal Academy of Sciences on 24 June 1783, effectively founding modern chemistry. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789. Blagden experimented on human ability to withstand high temperatures. In his report to the Royal Society in 1775, he was first Western scientist to officially recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation. Blagden's experiments on how dissolved substances like salt affected the freezing point of water led to the discovery that the freezing point of a solution decreases in direct proportion to the concentration of the solution, now called Blagden's Law.

Early life Coat of Arms of the House of Andrault Langeron, a member of a noble French family from Nivernais, held the titles of comte de Langeron, marquis de la Coste, baron de Cougny, de la Ferté et de Sassy, and lord du Mont, de Bazolle de l'Isle de Mars et d'Alligny. He entered the French army at age 15 as a Sous-Lieutenant in the Gardes Françaises Regiment and was dispatched to Caracas and then to Saint-Domingue from 1782 to 1783. Promoted to captain in the Condé-Dragons Regiment, he took part in the American Revolutionary War. In 1786, Langeron was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Médoc Regiment, and in 1788 he became colonel of the Armagnac Regiment. French Revolutionary Wars A Royalist, Langeron left France at the beginning of the French Revolution and entered Russian service in 1790 as a colonel in the Siberian Grenadier Regiment. He distinguished himself in battle against Sweden and then in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). Accompanied by the duc de Fronsac and Prince Charles de Ligne, the son of the famous Austrian diplomat Charles-Joseph, Prince de Ligne, he was present at Alexander Suvorov's capture of Izmail, where he was wounded. He was given leave of absence in order to serve in an émigré army against revolutionary France, and after his return to Russia was sent to the Austrian army in the Netherlands as an observer. He was promoted to brigade command in 1796 and became a major general in 1797 and lieutenant general in 1798. Napoleonic Wars He commanded the second column of the Austro-Russian army in the battle of Austerlitz, and disgraced after the lost battle, he was sent to Odessa. In 1815 he became governor of New Russia. From 1806 to 1811, Langeron participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812) and served in the Army of Moldavia against the Ottomans. He fought at Giurgiu, Silistra, Frasin, Derekoy, and Ruse, for which he was promoted to General of Infantry. In 1812, Langeron was given command of a corps in the Army of the Danube with which he fought at Brest-Litovsk and on the Berezina. In 1813, Langeron was put in charge of the blockade of Thorn, and later that year he commanded a corps at Koenigswarte, Bautzen, Siebeneichen, Lowenberg, Katzbach, and Leipzig. The next year he participated in the French campaign, during which he fought at the battles of Soissons, Craonne, Laon, Rheims, La Fère- Champenoise, and Paris. In late 1814, Langeron was given command of the 4th and 6th Corps in Volhynia. During the Hundred Days, he and his troops were marching to France, but they had only reached middle Germany by the time Napoléon was defeated at Waterloo. Later life Assumption Cathedral in Odessa After a brief return in France, during the Bourbon Restoration, Langeron returned to Odessa as he was appointed the Military Governor of Kherson and Odessa, the commander-in-chief of the Bug and Black Sea Cossacks, and the Governor of Yekaterinoslav, Kherson, and Crimea. Exports continued to grow under his rule, to 40 million rubles in 1817. In Odessa, Langeron opened the Richelieu Lyceum for the elite: only the children of merchants and Greek immigrants could enroll. During Langeron's tenure, the construction of the Odessa Botanical Gardens and Primorsky Boulevard began. The most far-reaching legislation in Langeron's term was that the port of Odessa was pronounced a free port in 1819, which allowed the selling and storing of imported goods with no customs duties. Today Odessa has a street and a beach named after Langeron. In 1823 Langeron was relieved of these duties because of poor health, and he then traveled to France until 1825. After the Decembrist revolt, Langeron was appointed a member of the sentencing panel. Called up with the start of the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 he fought against the Turks in a number of battles until he was replaced by Hans Karl von Diebitsch. Langeron died during a cholera epidemic in 1831.

Early life Princess Caroline was born at Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover, Germany, on 10 June 1713 (New Style Gregorian calendar). Her father was George Augustus, Hereditary Prince of Hanover, the eldest son of George Louis, Elector of Hanover. Her mother was Caroline of Ansbach, daughter of Johann Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. As a granddaughter of the Elector of Hanover, she was styled Princess Caroline of Hanover at birth. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, she was seventh in the line of succession to the British throne. She was baptised the day after her birth at Herrenhausen Palace. Great Britain In 1714, Queen Anne died, and Caroline's grandfather became George I and her father Prince of Wales. At the age of one year, Caroline accompanied her mother and elder sisters, the Princesses Anne and Amelia, to Great Britain, and the family resided at St James's Palace, London. She was then styled as a Princess of Great Britain. A newly attributed list from January–February 1728 documents her personal expenses, including charitable contributions to several Protestant groups in London.Ilias Chrissochoidis, \\"Princess Carolina's list of monthly expenses, January–February 1727/8,\\" Notes & Queries 58/3 (September 2011), 401–403.

She was fair, good, accomplished, and unhappy.\\" Later life Lord Hervey According to popular belief, Caroline's unhappiness was due to her love for the married courtier Lord Hervey. Hervey, who was bisexual, may have had an affair with Caroline's elder brother, Prince Frederick, and was romantically linked with several ladies of the court as well. When Hervey died in 1743, Caroline retired to St. James's Palace for many years prior to her own death, accessible to only her family and closest friends.Van der Kiste, p. 197 She gave generously to charity. Princess Caroline died, unmarried and childless, on 28 December 1757, aged 44, at St James's Palace. She was buried at Westminster Abbey. Horace Walpole, of the death of Princess Caroline, wrote: \\"Though her state of health had been so dangerous for years, and her absolute confinement for many of them, her disorder was, in a manner, new and sudden, and her death unexpected by herself, though earnestly her wish. Her goodness was constant and uniform, her generosity immense, her charities most extensive; in short, I, no royalist, could be lavish in her praise.\\" Arms On 31 January 1719, as a grandchild of the sovereign, Caroline was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a label argent of five points, each bearing three roses gules. On 30 August 1727, as a child of the sovereign, Caroline's difference changed to a label argent of three points, each bearing three roses gules.Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Caroline_Elizabeth_of_Great_Britain.svgCoat of Arms from 30 August 1727 Ancestors See also *List of British princesses *House of Hanover Notes References =Sources= * Category:1713 births Category:1757 deaths Category:18th-century British people Category:18th- century British women Category:British princesses Category:Nobility from Hanover Category:House of Hanover Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:German people of Scottish descent Category:Daughters of British monarchs ","title":"Princess Caroline of Great Britain"},{"id":"3396251","text":"Pogliaghi logo Pogliaghi was an Italian racing bicycle manufacturer, based in Milan, Italy.

The difference between a Pogliaghi made under his direct supervision and one that may not be is the *PSM* stamp on the seat-lug, and a chronologically- sequential serial number on the seat-lug or the head-lug. This serial number sequence appears to date all the way back to when Pogliaghi's uncle Brambilla owned the shop, where Sante Pogliaghi worked for him. Pogliaghi continued the serial number sequence when he took over in the late 1940s. Pogliaghi is on record stating he would retire by 1980, when he was interviewed for the book \\"The Custom Bicycle\\" but he officially closed his workshop on 1983. The PSM stamp and the serial numbers disappeared after the marque transfer. Marc Rossin supposedly took over rights to the marque first, and a number of Pogliaghis appeared with Rossin-style pantographing. Probably by the late 1980s rights to the name had passed to the Basso brothers.

Variations of the dish exist in some southern regions of China. In Thailand it was adapted to mussel omelettes; most Thai people have the misconception that oyster omelettes and mussel omelettes originated from Thai cuisine rather than Chinese. In Bangkok, notable areas for oyster omelettes include Talat Wang Lang near Siriraj Hospital; Wang Lang (Siriraj) Pier in Bangkok Noi where there are two restaurants; Yaowarat neighborhood, where there is one Michelin-Bib Gourmand restaurant with Charoen Krung neighborhood in Bang Rak, among others. In 2017, the World Street Food Congress announced that oyster omelette is one of the three most notable street food among the street foods of Thailand. The oyster omelette is a Taiwanese \\"night market favorite\\", and has constantly been ranked by many foreigners as the top dish from Taiwan. Its generous proportions and affordable price demonstrates the trait of night market cuisines. In the Philippines, English language menus often call the dish as \\"Oyster Cake\\". Ingredients The dish consists of an omelette with a filling primarily composed of small oysters. Starch (typically sweet potato starch) is mixed into the egg batter, giving the resulting egg wrap a thicker consistency. Pork lard is often used to fry the resulting omelet. Depending on regional variations, a savory sauce may then be poured on top of the omelette for added taste. Spicy or chili sauce mixed with lime juice is often added to provide an intense kick. Shrimp can sometimes be substituted in place of oysters; in this case, it is called shrimp omelette ().

Construction Built as the Orion by Krupp Germaniawerft at Kiel, Germany in 1929, the steel-hulled yacht was purchased from German-American woollen manufacturer Julius Forstmann on 13 November 1940. Converted to a gunboat at Brooklyn, New York, by the Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corporation, the erstwhile pleasure craft was renamed Vixen and designated PG-53. Commissioned at her conversion yard on 25 February, with Comdr. Pal L. Meadows in command, Vixen got underway for the Caribbean on 5 March 1941. Service history =1941-1942= During her shakedown cruise, the gunboat called at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before heading north for Norfolk, Virginia. She then cruised up the eastern seaboard to New London, Connecticut, and back to Norfolk again before she returned to New London on 23 May to assume duties as flagship for Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet, (ComSubLant), Rear Admiral Richard S. Edwards. The gunboat served Admiral Edwards throughout 1941. During this time, she participated in ceremonies off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, on 22 June, honoring the crew of - a training submarine which had gone down during practice diving tests on 20 June and had failed to surface. From 30 July to 13 August, she took part in Fleet maneuvers off New River, North Carolina; voyaged to Bermuda in October ; and cruised to Argentia, Newfoundland; and Casco Bay, Maine, before returning to New London on 6 December - the day before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Vixen remained at New London until 20 December, when Commander, Submarines, Atlantic, hauled down his flag. That day, the gunboat got underway for Newport, Rhode Island, where she went alongside the recently vacated flagship to pick up Admiral Ernest J. King's papers and belongings for transportation to the Washington Navy Yard. Earlier that day, King had flown from Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to Washington D.C. to commence his tour of duty as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. Vixen got underway on the day after Christmas and arrived at the nation's capital on the 28th. Two days later, on 30 December, Admiral King broke his four-starred flag at Vixens main. The gunboat served as his flagship, berthed at the Washington Navy Yard, until 17 June 1942 when she was relieved by . =1942-1944= While Vixen was undergoing the refit which followed, Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, was laying plans for the yacht's future deployment. \\"I hope to get the Vixen in mid-July,\\" he wrote an acquaintance on 10 June; \\"I will then be able to move to spots where there is more activity than here, and where I can see people, without their having to come to the 'mountain'.\\" Vixen embarked Admiral Ingersoll at Newport on 21 July and got underway for Boston in company with . Over the subsequent months, the ship ranged up and down the eastern seaboard from Maine to the Caribbean isles. Calling at Portland, Maine; New London; Philadelphia; New York City; Norfolk; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Bermuda; the Dominican Republic; Trinidad; Curaçao - the ship's itinerary showed clearly that Ingersoll had mobility and was utilizing it to the fullest. From this base of operations, Ingersoll kept his finger on the pulse of German U-boat activity and the problems confronting the officers and ships under his command. Under his leadership, the Atlantic Fleet slowly, but surely, turned the tide against the Nazi submarines. His close contact with his commanders enabled Ingersoll to know local conditions and thus to deploy his forces where they could be most useful. =1944-1945= On 15 November 1944, Admiral Jonas H. Ingram relieved Ingersoll as Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, and broke his flag in Vixen. Ingram, who had so successfully conducted United States-Brazilian relations during the period when he commanded American naval forces in the South Atlantic, would fly his flag in the gunboat through the end of hostilities, as the Atlantic Fleet continued to wear down the U-boat offensive. =Decommissioning and sale= Vixen was decommissioned on 24 May 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 3 July 1946. Transferred to the War Shipping Administration, Vixen was sold on 21 January 1947. =In commercial service, 1947-2004= Vixen reverted to her original name, Orion, and operated as a cruise ship in the Panama region. In 1965 she was saved from the scrap yard by Epirotiki Lines of Greece. She was taken to Pireus in Greece where she was rebuilt from the hull upwards and turned into the Argonaut, a luxury cruise ship under charter to Raymond Whitcombe, touring, amongst others, places such as the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and the Fjords of Norway. In 1995 she was sold to Memnon Tours of Cairo, Egypt, and renamed Regina Maris, operating a seven-night cruise in the Red Sea, and later in 2001, the Mediterranean, under charter to Phoenix Reisen of Germany. She was laid up in Alexandria, Egypt, from late 2001 until 2004 when she was sold and taken to Greece to be used as a floating hotel during the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. She was sold for scrap once the Games were over, and taken to Turkey where she was broken up in 2005.  References  * * Lenton, H.J. World War 2 Fact Files: American Gunboats and Minesweepers.

In addition, he has made television documentaries for ITV, and was the presenter of Jeff Randall Live on Sky News. Randall has criticised the BBC for being biased and left wing. He noted an occasion when he wore Union Jack cufflinks and a producer told him he could not wear them on air as it would be seen as an endorsement for the National Front. Randall also told of an occasion where he complained to a senior news executive about the BBC's pro-multicultural stance. In a reply he was told \\"The BBC is not neutral in multiculturalism: it believes in it and it promotes it\\".The Power and the Story: The Global Battle for News and Information By John Lloyd, page 375 He further criticised the bias of the BBC, stating that working at the BBC was \\"bit like walking into a Sunday meeting of the Flat Earth Society.

Opinions Writing for The Daily Telegraph at the time of the 2005 Conservative Party leadership election, Randall said he would not trust David Cameron \\"with my daughter's pocket money. [...] To describe Cameron's approach to corporate PR as unhelpful and evasive overstates by a widish margin the clarity and plain-speaking that he brought to the job of being Michael Green's mouthpiece. [...] In my experience, Cameron never gave a straight answer when dissemblance was a plausible alternative, which probably makes him perfectly suited for the role he now seeks: the next Tony Blair.\\" In August 2007, he launched an attack in the Daily Telegraph on the Labour government, claiming that \\"the United Kingdom's authority as a sovereign nation has been greatly eroded, our democratic traditions trashed, and the make-up of our society put through the mangle of enforced multiculturalism – all without anything so vulgar as a plebiscite. Like geese being prepared for the production of foie gras, we are having stuffed down our throats that which we do not wish to swallow: the rough corn of Labour's determination to make its changes irreversible.

It covers parts of the Alba, Arad, Bihor, Cluj and Hunedoara counties of Romania and a section of it forms the Apuseni Natural Park. Țara Moților's inhabitants are known as \\"moți\\" (, ). Some scholars consider the 'moți' as descendants of the Celts, because of their blonde hair and blue eyes, elements more frequent here than among other Romanians; however, the hypothesis is not accepted by mainstream historians due to its lack of consistency. Other scholars believe that they are the descendants of Slavs, for the same very reasons, or of the Alans. Yet another group of scholars consider them the descendants of Germanic tribes (Gepids). Due to their blonde hair and blue eyes, so far seventeen theories regarding their origins have been formulated. They live in scattered villages at altitudes up to about 1,400 m, higher than any other permanent settlements in Romania. The 'Țara Moților' traditionally begins at Bistra, just before Câmpeni, formerly called Topani by the moți themselves or Topesdorf by the Austrians, traditionally considered the unofficial capital of the moți, while the villages down the Arieș towards Turda such as Lupșa, Sălciua etc. are inhabited by the mocani. The moți were also known under the name of 'topi' (in German 'Die Zopfen'). Before the last change of the old administrative boundaries there existed an Arieș county in its own right. Etymology and history The term \\"Țara\\" means literally \\"country\\" (cf. Latin and medieval Latin: terra); exceptionally in this case (differently from Țara Bârsei, Țara Oașului, Țara Făgărașului, Țara Hațegului, Țara Zărandului and Maramureș), it doesn't imply any political, social or administrative status. It is, instead, an archaic term referring to an enclosed and more or less isolated depression between the Carpathians. The region has a long history of resistance and fighting for political, economical and social rights, with movements such as the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan (1784–1785) and the Romanian part of the Transylvanian revolution of 1848 having their origins here. Economy =Industry= Logging, woodworking and mining are the main traditional industrial activities in Țara Moților, with leather processing, blacksmith work, the miller's trade, and the manual combing and spinning of wool as secondary activities. The large Oak, beech and spruce forests provide the material for the famous artisanal barrels, furniture and other specific items made there. Coal (at Brad), iron (at Băișoara and Iara), silver and gold (at Baia de Arieș, Bucium, Roșia Montană, Zlatna, Băița, Musariu, Criscior), bauxite (at Vârciorog, Roșia, Dobrești, Zece Hotare), mercury (at Izvorul Ampoiului), copper, lead, zinc (at Băișa, Săcărâmb, Roșia Poieni) and molybdenum (at Băița) are all extracted here to the present day, with some of the mines (Roșia Montană) being almost 2000 years old. =Agriculture= Because of the highland conditions, the moţi practice animal husbandry. Their main livestock of choice is cattle and the local highland cattle, called \\"Pinzgau de Transilvania\\", a variant of Tyrolese Pinzgau breed, was introduced by the Austrians during the 19th century. Sheep, poultry and pig farming are a secondary choice for farmers in the area. Along south-facing mountain slopes, and along the narrow river valleys one can found scattered cultivation of potatoes, barley and even cold-resistant vegetables. Tourism Spring in Țara Moților The zone is renowned for its folkloric traditions, stunning landscapes, and the variation of the Karstic relief which produced over 800 natural caves such as Scărișoara, Focul Viu (both of them with surviving glaciers inside) and Peștera Urșilor (which contains fossils of Ursus spelaeus, the cave bear). Agritourism and ecotourism are also widely practiced in the area. The main winter sports center for the area is in Arieșeni. = A partial list of tourist attractions = * Avram Iancu * Arieșeni * Vidra * Dealul cu Melci * Scărișoara Cave * Peștera Poarta lui Ionele (Ionele's Gate Cave) * Focul Viu Cave (The Cave of the Living Fire) * Peştera Urșilor (Bears' Cave) * Cheile Turzii (Turda Gorges) * Cheile Gălzii (Galda Gorges) * Cheile Ampoiței (Ampoita Gorges) * Cheile Ordăncușii (Ordăncușa Gorges) * The Maidens' Fair on Găina Mountain. * \\"The Hill With Snails\\" west of Vidra. * Barren Detunata and Shaggy Detunata (Detunatele) * The Arieș River gorges Category:Historical regions of Transylvania ","title":"Țara Moților"},{"id":"3396291","text":"David Dark is an American writer, the author of Life's Too Short To Pretend You're Not Religious, The Sacredness of Questioning Everything, Everyday Apocalypse: The Sacred Revealed in Radiohead, The Simpsons, and Other Pop Culture Icons and The Gospel According To America: A Meditation on a God- blessed, Christ-haunted Idea, which was included in Publishers’ Weekly’s top religious books of 2005.

Legio V Iovia was a Roman legion levied by Diocletian in the end of the 3rd century, and was still in service at the beginning of the 5th century. The cognomen of the legion refers to Jupiter, to whom Diocletian (also known as Iovianus, \\"the man like Jupiter\\") was devoted and identified. The V Iovia was stationed, together to her sister legion VI Herculia, in Pannonia Secunda, a new province created with the segmentation of the old Pannonia province. The legion received the ordinal \\"Fifth\\" because in Pannonia there were already four legions. The purpose of the legion, having her permanent camp in Bononia and an advanced castellum in Onagrinum, was to protect the imperial residence of Diocletian in Sirmium (Illyricum).

In radioactive decay Secular equilibrium can occur in a radioactive decay chain only if the half-life of the daughter radionuclide B is much shorter than the half- life of the parent radionuclide A. In such a case, the decay rate of A and hence the production rate of B is approximately constant, because the half- life of A is very long compared to the time scales considered. The quantity of radionuclide B builds up until the number of B atoms decaying per unit time becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time. The quantity of radionuclide B then reaches a constant, equilibrium value. Assuming the initial concentration of radionuclide B is zero, full equilibrium usually takes several half-lives of radionuclide B to establish. The quantity of radionuclide B when secular equilibrium is reached is determined by the quantity of its parent A and the half-lives of the two radionuclide. That can be seen from the time rate of change of the number of atoms of radionuclide B: :\\\\frac{dN_B}{dt} = \\\\lambda_A N_A - \\\\lambda_B N_B, where λA and λB are the decay constants of radionuclide A and B, related to their half-lives t1/2 by \\\\lambda = \\\\ln(2)/t_{1/2}, and NA and NB are the number of atoms of A and B at a given time. Secular equilibrium occurs when dN_B/dt = 0, or :N_B = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_A}{\\\\lambda_B} N_A. Over long enough times, comparable to the half-life of radionuclide A, the secular equilibrium is only approximate; NA decays away according to :N_A(t) = N_A(0) e^{-\\\\lambda_A t}, and the \\"equilibrium\\" quantity of radionuclide B declines in turn.

Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa's Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers. Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.Mara Lee, \\"With $3 Million, State Lures Chemical Firm Mired In Pollution Disputes\\", Hartford Courant, June 6, 2012. The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, \\"Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets.\\" Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US federal government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion. History The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City- based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an initial public offering on November 21, 2005.

It was established in 1976 and has operated as the agent and distributor of Nintendo products in the Nordic countries since 1981. Bergsala's administrative center and warehouse is in Kungsbacka, with local offices in Norway, Denmark, and Finland. History Bergsala was originally a small electronics company co- founded by Owe Bergsten of Sweden. While on a trip in Singapore in 1981, he and his business partner saw one of the early Game & Watch LCD game at an electronic store and purchased one for the flight home to Sweden, having heard that LCD games would likely become popular. Realizing its potential, Bergsten found it was Nintendo that made the game, and sent a telex message to Nintendo's Japanese headquarters, pretending to be a larger distributor and seeking to resell their Game & Watch products in Sweden. After several months, Nintendo agreed to sell him 250 units, but Bergsten found these difficult to sell, as at that point, the Swedish population did not show much interest in video games. Within the year, a colleague returned from Japan and showed Bergsten the new color-based Game & Watch models. Bergsten decide to fly to Japan and speak with Nintendo's export offices directly about ordering these units. The trip had several mishaps that nearly caused the meeting not to happen, but by the end of the trip, Bergsten had secured the distribution rights to Nintendo products for Sweden. Initially he had purchased 30,000 units for Sweden but these sold slowly, until he found a watch distributor that saw the potential for the LCD games. By the start of 1982, Bergsten was selling 180,000 units a month. He made frequent trips back to Nintendo to obtain more orders including new versions of the Game & Watch hardware, and by January 1983, had sold over 1.7 million units in Sweden. Around that time, the Swedish market for games became saturated, and sales had significantly dropped. Bergsten continued to keep in contact with Nintendo over the next year as he was expecting them to release new products: at this point, the 1983 video game crash had decimated the North American market, while Nintendo was preparing to launch its Family Computer (Famicom) unit. Bergsten brought some of the Famicom units and NTSC-compatible televisions back to Sweden after one trip to Nintendo, and from reactions of his staff and associates, believed it would be as successful as the Game & Watch in Sweden. He tried to convince Nintendo to release a compatible Famicom system in Europe, but Nintendo was wary of any television-based video game system due to the 1983 crash. Bergsten continued to urge Nintendo to release the system in Europe, and by 1985, Nintendo agreed to send him about 10,000 units, modified Famicom units with PAL output. This never happened due to Nintendo having a change of heart and bringing a redesigned Family Computer, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), to the West: after Nintendo released the North American version, the company created a PAL-compatible version of the NES for release in Europe. Bergsala remains the authorised import partner and primary distributor of Nintendo products in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries since this point. While Nintendo formed branch regional offices, such as Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, with individual offices per country, Nintendo kept Bergsala as the key operator for Scandinavia. In addition, Bergsala was responsible for starting the first fan club for players of Nintendo's products, which would eventually become Club Nintendo. Bergsala's club, Nintendo Videospelklubb, launched alongside the NES release in Europe in 1986, had 450,000 members at the height of its success, and it served as a model for Nintendo of America's Nintendo Fun Club. Current operations The original Mario statue that stood outside Bergsala's offices since the 1980s until 2016, when it was replaced with another statue more faithful to the character's modern design. Today, Bergsala themselves handle the distribution of Nintendo products in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark and the distribution of Pokémon Trading Card Game products in Norway and Finland. Bergsala operates two important marketing web sites: the Nintendo website and the Pokémon website. The Nintendo website has the same layout and mostly the same content in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the design found on it in all countries is originally from the Swedish website (all the other sites were edited to match the Swedish one later). The same goes for the Pokémon website, where the original Norwegian website was translated to Finnish, Danish and Swedish. The Pokémon website contains information about the Pokémon video games, Pokémon TV show, and Pokémon Trading Card Game—including the Pokémon Trading Card Games Pokémon Organized Play Program. Bergsala's headquarters in Kungsbacka are located at Marios Gata 21 (Mario's Street 21), named after the famous Nintendo character Mario. Early on, the company had constructed a statue with Mario on top of it outside of its headquarters, which generally was considered a poor rendition of the character and had been compared to Saddam Hussein. In 2016, it replaced the statue with a more true-to-form version of Mario atop of a warp pipe. In December 2019, Bergsala, as well as other Bergsala Holding-owned distributors, were combined with Bergsala Holding's developer and publisher Thunderful to create the Thunderful Group. Within the Thunderful Group, Bergsala became part of the Thunderful Distribution branch.

The band played its first show in 1980 and was active initially for approximately a decade, undergoing multiple personnel changes with frontman John Kezdy the only constant, before disbanding in 1990. The band released 5 albums and several EPs, most on the record label they founded in 1981, Ruthless Records, which was distributed by Enigma. Later albums were on the Fever Records and Roadkill Records labels. They toured the U.S. and Canada and played notable venues, including CBGB, Maxwell's, First Avenue (nightclub), Mabuhay Gardens, Paycheck's (Detroit), Exit (Chicago) and The Rathskeller, among others. They also received a significant amount of national airplay on college radio at a time when it was the only medium for alternative music. History The Effigies' website states that they were one of the first punk bands in Chicago. This might be a complicated claim for a band not formed until 1980, but true in the sense that the Midwest resisted punk and was late to discover or appreciate it to any degree. In the years immediately after The Ramones and The Sex Pistols first released records (1977), Chicago remained dominated by classic rock, disco and blues; punk bands were anathema to the Midwest rock establishment and had few places to play and fans had few places to hear live bands. Despite revisionistic claims in its later advertised station history, even Chicago's \\"progressive\\" radio station, WXRT, was never very supportive of punk or even new wave, outside a few efforts of a couple of DJs relegated to late night slots. What most punk fans recall as the first \\"scene\\" in Chicago did not rise until the very early 1980s, when clubs like Oz and O’Banion’s started to provide venues for live punk. In a 1999 retrospective about the 1985 music year, Chicago Sun-Times music writer Jim Derogatis termed the heyday of The Effigies \\"the second generation of Midwestern punks,\\" but this is correct only in describing the burgeoning young 1985 Midwest punk scene as it overtook the smaller, older scene which had cloistered itself in punk discos like La Mere Vipere and for all its excesses was musically passive, generating no bands and creating no music. By 1985,The Effigies, Naked Raygun, Strike Under and Big Black had been around for half a decade. There were no active punk bands in Chicago before them. Attempts to characterize The Effigies as post-punk, hardcore and, to the extent it is distinguishable, Chicago hardcore, reveal the difficulty in pigeonholing the band's sound which is more expansive than the punk subgenres both musically and thematically. Even the catch-all \\"post-hardcore\\" becomes an inapt anachronism in light of the fact that the band's seminal releases pre-date the arrival of hardcore by several years. Indie rock pundit Steve Albini writes that \\"The Effigies were absolutely essential to the development of a healthy punk scene in Chicago. Between them and Naked Raygun, in the early 80s they basically kept the scene going until it developed momentum beyond them.\\" \\"The Effigies were a moving force during a crucial and exhilarating time.\\" The history of The Effigies develops in three discernible periods, each marked by a different lead guitarist. The Effigies' original lineup consisted of John Kezdy (vocals), Earl \\"Oil\\" Letiecq (guitar), Paul Zamost (bass) and Steve Economou (drums). By 1984 Letiecq’s distractions had estranged him from the group, and in the words of Zamost, “we had problems with our guitar player. We had to switch guitar players....” Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar made inquiries about joining the band. Robert O’Connor replaced Letiecq as lead guitarist and this second lineup released two LPs, Fly on a Wire, and Ink. These albums were engineered and co-produced with the band by Iain Burgess, and were distinguished from the recordings of the first lineup by their sublimated aggression and comparatively muted rhythms. They also hinted at another growing division in the band. As Burgess put it, \\"they got a lot of heat for the change in musical direction to some degree on the latter two albums that I worked on, Ink and Fly on a Wire. I think both of which have some really f*g good songs on them, and some are, well, in my opinion, just not all that marvelous. I think John (Kezdy) would say the same thing. I’m sure he likes all the songs, but some of it we could have done better.\\" It was at this stage the band began getting tagged with the ill-fitting post-punk and post-hardcore labels. Perceiving the band's punk ethos as an obstacle to \\"mass appeal,\\" Zamost and O'Connor joined O'Connor's wife to form a new band called Machines in Motion during the summer of 1986 to pursue a more commercial sound. Economou fell in with them. This effectively dissolved The Effigies in the middle of a national tour supporting their third LP, Ink. Prosaic and muddled, Machines in Motion were poorly received and broke up acrimoniously after only a few performances. The O'Connors dropped back into obscurity and Zamost began a long string of short-lived bands. In 1987 Kezdy reunited with Letiecq and added Chris Bjorklund (Strike Under, Bloodsport, Trial by Fire)(bass) and Joe Haggerty (drums). In 1988, Letiecq departed again to form the band Jack Scratch with Dave Bergeron, formerly of Bloodsport. Bjorklund moved to guitar and Tom Woods became the Effigies' bassist. Coincidentally, Bjorklund, Haggerty, and Woods had comprised the rest of Bloodsport. In 1990, the Effigies called it quits and Kezdy pursued a career as an attorney. The original line up reunited for a one-off show in 1992. They came together again in late 1995 and early 1996 to play a few Chicago shows to celebrate the reissue of their Remains Nonviewable compilation CD on Touch and Go Records. After seventeen years of unremarkable musical projects, Economou and Zamost sought a rapprochement with Kezdy. The Effigies re-formed in 2004 and in 2007 released their first recording in nearly 20 years, a full LP titled Reside, which was a return to their earlier form. The album was produced by Andy Gerber, who once played with Zamost and Economou in the band Laughing Man. The most recent lineup consisted of original members John Kezdy, Paul Zamost, and Steve Economou, and new guitarist Robert McNaughton, who had previously been in the bands Pop Media, We're Staying, and along with Zamost, The Indicators, The Lemmings, The Greys, 80 Proof Preacher and People Like Us. McNaughton composed music for the film Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Since 2010 Economou has also been collaborating with Steve Bjorklund and keyboardist LizB in the band High Value Target.  Miscellaneous  The cover of the band's record \\"Haunted Town\\" constitutes the first use of the Chicago flag as a countercultural geo-signifier. Consequently, the flag was adopted as a motif within the nascent Chicago punk scene and later became fashionable outside the milieu of music. In late 2010, The Effigies were slated to play a Riot Fest show commemorating the re-release of the 1981 Busted at Oz compilation. The show was to be at a Chicago venue called the Metro and featured a number of reunited groups that had appeared on the original compilation. Due to the band's long-standing objection to the Metro as a venue – alluded to in a 1993 interview with bassist Zamost – the show was moved to a smaller club, the Double Door. Initially agreeing to fill out the original lineup for what promised to be a compelling show, guitarist Letiecq pulled out within weeks of the show and just prior to the event posted a note on the Riot Fest website declaiming against the endeavor and vowing for unstated reasons never to perform with the original members again. Without their guitarist, the remaining band members withdrew from the show rather than appear as an unrehearsed and falsely billed original line-up. John Kezdy is the older brother of Naked Raygun bassist Pierre Kezdy. The Effigies can be seen in You Weren’t There, a 2007 film about the Chicago punk scene from 1977 through 1984.

Pte Ltd is a retail company which has department stores in Singapore and Malaysia. The company owns the Robinsons department store, John Little in Singapore and has franchise outlets of Marks and Spencer in both countries. The company has grown into one of the country's most renowned department stores. Robinsons celebrated their 160th anniversary in 2018. Robinsons & Co. Limited is currently part of the UAE-based Al-Futtaim Group. History Spicer & Robinson was established on February 25, 1858 by Philip Robinson formerly from the west of England and a brother of Elisha Smith Robinson and his business partner James Gaborian Spicer, who was a former keeper of the Singapore jail, and a partner in the shipwright business, it was located at Commercial Square. However, on October 5, 1859, less than two years after the partnership, James Spicer pulled out from the partnership in 5 October 1859, and the company was known as Robinson & Co.. Robinson found a new partner, George Rappa Jr.. At this point of time, Commercial Square was renamed Raffles Place. Robinson & Co. moved to the corner of North Bridge Road and Coleman Street. Robinson developed his business a different way. He employed travelling representatives to canvass the Malay Archipelago and Borneo. Many of the Malay Rulers were among his customers, as well as King Mongkut of Siam. Near the end of 1864, there was a financial crisis, firms crashed and hundreds of shops closed down. Robinson managed to survive during this period of time. A new shop was opened at Battery Road, and the company's first assistant was appointed from England, T. C. Loveridge, which took charge of a newly opened tailoring department. Loveridge took lessons in Singapore from an experienced cutter and first tried out his skill by cutting out a frockcoat for a colleague. It fitted well and the latter became a partner in the business. Robinson offered to sell out for £1,000 (which was a huge sum of money then), but Loveridge rejected the offer. 1881 was when Robinson died. His son, Stamford Raffles Robinson took over the business. In 1886, he employed A. W. Bean as assistant, eight years later making him his partner. The 1890s saw the company doing more business than ever before in the Malayan states (now Malaysia). The company launched a large advertising campaign in the Malay Mail and increase the number of travelling representatives. In 1891 the company moved to a bigger shop in Raffles Place. Robinsons also stocked musical instruments in the early 1900s as most homes had a piano, gramophone among many. Robinson & Co. became a limited company in 1920, when Robinson and Bean were still partners. The carefree days of Singapore and the then Malaya were gone when the Great Depression came. The company's main store in Kuala Lumpur, which was located next to the Whiteaway Laidlaw department store, the present-day site of the Malaysian head office for OCBC Bank by the Masjid Jamek LRT station on Jalan Tun Perak, opened in 1928 just before the start of the Depression. For many years the company operated at a loss until 1936 when it made a profit. Stamford Robinson died in 1935 at 83 in Edinburgh, Scotland. The company moved to a newer and bigger store at Raffles Chambers in November 1941. The building was air-conditioned at the café, men and women hairdressing salons. The Japanese bombed the building on December 8, 1941, but business opened as usual the next day. It suffered damage when it was attacked again on 13 February 1942. The last days of the British fell to the Japanese, saw only one person running the cafe. Allied troops fighting in Malaya were unable to find supplies, and the Manager of the Kuala Lumpur branch could get camp beds for them. Both stores were looted in the final days of the war. However, the company's $5,000 worth of silver and other valuables could not be retrieved. Even the best locksmiths or oxy-acetylene torches could not open the room. The Raffles Place store was used as the headquarters of NAAFI and Ensa, the Services' entertainment organisation when the British returned to Singapore in 1945. Robinsons reopened in April 1946, business flourished and earned a profit of $1 million, the first time in history. John Little's Marina Square store. Robinsons acquired a 76% stake on John Little and the whole company in the end of 1955. The Raffles Place store was fully air-conditioned by then and was the first in the region. Robinsons got the franchise for Marks and Spencer for Singapore in 1958. On 21 November 1972, the Raffles Place outlet caught fire. As a result, the building was reduced to rubble. Nine people died in the blaze. The store moved to Specialist's Shopping Centre on Orchard Road. Centrepoint, Orchard Road during Christmas 2004. Robinsons moved again to Centrepoint in June 1983 with 130,000 sq ft spread over five floors. The store went through a refurbishment in 2001 with a brand new look. It opened another store at Raffles City that same year in March. The Raffles City store used to be a Sogo outlet but closed down shortly after it filed bankruptcy. In 2003, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation and Great Eastern was planning to sell away their joint stake in the company to remove its non-core assets. A few companies had plans to buy the group. In the end, OCBC and Great Eastern did not sell the 37% stake away. The company used to house their headquarters on the fifth floor of Centrepoint in the department store but has since moved to Orchard Building for more retail space under the lead new CEO. Meanwhile, probably as a result of the 1973 crisis, the Kuala Lumpur branch on Jalan Tun Perak (Masjid Jamek) also closed around 1975. The building was acquired by United Asian Bank in 1976, and it was demolished to make way for the bank's headquarters (now called Menara UAB). The store however made a comeback in Kuala Lumpur in 2007 after a thirty-two year absence when its new store opened at The Gardens, Mid Valley City. A second store is opened at Four Seasons Place (next to the Petronas Towers), thus marking Robinsons' return to Kuala Lumpur's central business district since its Masjid Jamek store closed in 1975. =Sale to Lippo Group= In 2006, OCBC sold its 29.9% stake in the group to Indonesia's Lippo Group (under Auric Pacific Singapore) for S$203 million as they could not own more than 5% in non-core assets. In October 2006, there was a controversial board meeting, with new owner Lippo booting out long serving chairman Michael Wong Pakshong. Another board member, Chew Gek Khim, who narrowly retained her seat in the board, resigned on 30 October 2006, after serving the board for 18 years. Chew was the chairman of its remuneration and nominating committees of the corporation. She is the granddaughter of the late Tan Sri Dr. Tan Chin Tuan, the latter invested in the company when he was at OCBC. Days later, the two remaining independent directors resigned from the company's board. They are Cham Tao Soon and Winston Tan. Stephen Riady told the media that he was interviewing candidates for new independent directors back in September. Stephen has been a board director of the company since Auric Pacific acquired the company. The fallout at the AGM has questioned several retail investors questioning the manner of how OCBC sold its stake in April 2006.Ex-Robinson director denies being told of no-support vote, Lee Su Shyan, The Straits Times, 8 November 2006 =Sale to Al Futtaim Group= In April 2008, the Al Futtaim Group bought 88% of the shares of Robinsons & Co. at S$7.20 per share. Under the new owners, the chain tried to go upmarket, opening a 20,800 square feet concept store at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands in September 2011. It was not successful, however, and closed just two years later in May 2013, with Mr Kraatz saying that the space was insufficient as \\"customers expect a full-fledged department store which sells everything when they step into Robinsons\\".http://news.asiaone.com/news/plush/robinsons-fancy-new- home?nopaging=1 In June 2013, the store opened its first suburban branch with four floors of retail space at nearly 85,000 square feet,at Jem in Jurong Easthttp://www.herworldplus.com/shopping/updates/robinsons-brings-singapore- fashion-and-more-new-labels-jem and in November 2013, the Centrepoint flagship store closed when the lease expired. It moved to its current location in the Heeren, with an even bigger space of 186,000 sq ft spread over six floors of retail space. In 2016, Robinsons & Co launched its first e-commerce website alongside the Autumn Winter 2016 Campaign. In 2017, Robinsons expands to Middle East, by opening a three-level store at Dubai Festival City in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In 2018, a three-level store at Kingdom Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was opened. In 2020, Robinsons announced that it will close its Jem location in August 2020. Currently, the company is working with staff to move them to the two remaining Robinsons outlets, and to other brands under the Al-Futtaim Group which include Marks & Spencer and Zara, or to help them find other employment with Jem.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is distributed throughout Europe as far east as the Urals and also in the Azores, in Algeria, and in Asia Minor, Armenia, and Syria. It is strongly migratory. Description This species has a wingspan of 45–52 mm and the forewings are very distinctively shaped with a sharply pointed apex. The common name is derived from the characteristic markings on the forewings: the base colour is buffish, brown towards the termen, and is marked with a bold V-shaped pink-and-green marking. Despite this bright colouring, the angular markings provide excellent disruptive patterning camouflage. The hindwings are whitish with darker venation. Technical description and variation It has a wingspan of 45–52 mm. Forewing whitish ochreous, the base and costal area extensively pinkish; a triangular space on inner margin before the inner line, the terminal area beyond submarginal line, and a costal shade beyond outer line olive greenish; central area dark green, pinkish towards costa, triangular in shape, the blunt apex resting on inner margin; the three stigmata more or less rosy green, the two upper with pale lateral edges; outer line double and angled outwards on vein 5; submarginal line preceded by a blackish-green lunule between veins 6 and 7; fringe rufous green, blackish along the excision below vein 4; hindwing pale ochreous, with the discal spot, veins, and often the whole inner half tinged with greenish fuscous; dark outer and double submarginal lines, the latter often forming a grey band below vein 4; ab. roseobrunnea ab. nov [Warren] from São Jorge Island in the Azores, has the central triangle rich red brown tinged with fulvous, the whole wing reddish tinged, and the green shades all strongly mixed with reddish, the metathorax and dorsal tufts also being deep fulvous instead of green.Seitz, A.

This moth flies mainly at night and is attracted to light and sugar. It may often be seen during the day at rest on fences and garden foliage. The larva are dull green or pinkish brown, thickly dotted with pale; dorsal line whitish, interrupted; lateral lines narrowly whitish; segments 4—11 with oblique darker lateral stripes. The larva is green or brown with reddish spots along the sides and faint dark chevrons along the back. It feeds on a wide variety of plants (see list below). This species overwinters as a larva.

A total of 50 vessels were constructed of this type during the 1960s and served in five different navies. Vessels =Prototype= The prototype, the patrol boat Nasty, was designed as a private venture in 1957 by A/S Båtservice of Oslo, in close cooperation with Royal Norwegian Navy officers with World War II experience in fast patrol boats: The chief designer was naval architect Jan Herman Linge. Nasty was built by Westermoen Båtbyggeri of Mandal, Norway. She was an experimental craft, of wooden hull construction, and was launched in 1958. Nasty served with the Royal Norwegian Navy, and her design was sought after by several other navies, though it required modification to be suitable for serial production.

José Julián Herculano del Casal y de la Lastra (November 7, 1863 – October 21, 1893) was a poet from Havana, Cuba. He started his writing career at a young age and later in life was known as an important forebearer of modernistic expression in Latin America. He took his influence from the French poetic styles of the day and later, Rubén Darío and Modernismo.  Early life  Casal was born in Havana, Cuba. The family of Julián del Casal was not wealthy, but they lived comfortably. His mother, a Cuban native named Maria del Carmen de la Lastra y Owens, died in 1868 when Casal was four years old. He was raised by his father, a Spaniard known as Julián del Casal y Ugareda, who died later in 1885 when Casal was twenty-two years old. Casal was born into a Catholic family and was baptized on December 23 at two months old, in La iglesia del Santo Angel Custodio, by his godparents Don José de la Lastra and Doña Matilde de la Lastra y Owens. = Education = University of Havana in Havana, Cuba In 1870, Julián del Casal began his education at a very formal school named El Real Colegio de Belén. He graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1880. After graduating from El Real Colegio de Belén he decided to enroll in the Havana University School of Law. He started in 1881 but he did not stay there long and was forced to drop out because of family monetary issues. After he dropped out he pursued his writing career and began working as a finance minister.  Career  At the early age of fourteen, Casal began his own newspaper press with a fellow high school alumna, Arturo Mora. They titled their newspaper El Estudiante, periódico clandestino y manuscrito. After he graduated high school, he published his first work in a science, arts and literature weekly journal. Casal titled the poem El Ensayo and it was the first publication from a poet to be seen in a Cuban press. In this same year, he also began working as a clerk at El Ministerio de Hacienda (The Treasury Department). His writing career began to pick up when in 1885, Casal began publishing works in La Habana Elegante, a Cuban magazine that acted as a medium for the Modernist movement of that time. In 1888, he began working with El Figaro as well. Later that year, he traveled to Madrid, Spain. In 1889 Casal returned to his homeland of Cuba where he started to assist with meetings with the Galeria Literaria. In 1890 he published his first book which he named Hojas al Viento and helped to edit La Discusiónn The following year he started working with La Habana Literaria. His second book Nieve was published in 1892; the same year he met Ruben Dario and when Dario dedicated El Clavicordio de la Abuela to Casal. In 1893 he had a lot of contact with Dario including an article he wrote about Dario and a letter that Casal sent to Dario towards the end of his life. = Major works = Casal only published two poetry collections during his lifetime, Hojas al viento and Nieve. His last collection, Bustos y rimas was never completed while he was alive, however it appeared in 1893 shortly after his death with the help of Casal's friend, Enrique Hernández Miyares. It differs from his earlier works because it contains both prose and poetry. Hojas al viento includes forty-nine poems and is considered an example of Casal's early writing style. The poems in this collection are topical in nature and often refer to contemporary events. A few of them were even characterized as \\"imitations\\" and show the influence of other writers. The work was well received by his contemporaries as an early offering by a poet with much promise. Casal continued to publish poems in various Cuban periodicals and in 1892 he compiled many of these pieces in his second collection, Nieve. Divided into five sections, the poems in this collection are categorized according to theme. The first section, Bocetos antiguos, includes poems inspired by pagan and Judeo-Christian thought; the second section, Mi museo ideal, is famous because the poems contained in it were inspired by the art of Gustave Moreau, with whom Julián had an ongoing correspondence with. The third section, Cromos españoles, is a collection of well-known Spanish word pictures. The fourth, Marfiles viejos, contains sixteen sonnets that all reflect his fears and concerns about life in general. The fifth and final section titled La gruta del ensueño, completes the collection with seventeen miscellaneous poems. Nieve was met with some critical success, although most contemporaries in Cuba felt that Julián del Casal's themes were too dark and pessimistic.  Later life  Casal's friend and colleague, Rubén Darío. Julián del Casal continued publishing works up until his death in October 1893. Earlier that year, he wrote an article about his colleague Rubén Darío, the famous father of Modernism, in the Cuban magazine La Habana Elegante. Casal also began writing his final book Bustos y Rimas. Before his death, Casal wrote a letter to Rubén Darío in which he talked about premonitions he was having about death. Not too long after this, Casal was at a colleague's home when he suffered a hemorrhage during conversation after dinner. He died due to this and was buried in his family pantheon. His final book, Bustos y Rimas was finished by his colleague and friend Enrique Hernández Miyares and published shortly after Casal's death.

For passenger service, the locomotives required extra components for providing steam or head-end power (HEP) for heating, lighting and electricity in passenger cars. Most of these passenger locomotives were rebuilt from older freight locomotives, while some were built as brand new models.  GP40TC  GO Transit GP40TC 501 with Bombardier Bi-Level Coaches in October 1980 The GMD GP40TC was built by General Motors Diesel (GMD), for GO Transit in Toronto. Eight units were manufactured between 1966 and 1968. They were built on an enlarged frame to accommodate a head-end power generator. GO Transit sold the fleet to Amtrak in 1988, where they were based in Chicago and used on short-haul trains. In 2005, the Norfolk Southern Railway rebuilt all eight GP40TC locomotives at its Juniata Shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. These are now classed as GP38H-3, and work as maintenance-of-way trains or standby power for Downeaster trains.  GP40P  GP40P 3676 operating on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. Thirteen GP40Ps were built in October 1968 for the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and paid for by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). The CNJ put the units in service on the Raritan Valley Line and the North Jersey Coast Line. The CNJ's passenger operations were transferred to NJDOT in 1976 (with Conrail operating them under contract), and in 1983 New Jersey Transit assumed operating passenger rail service in the state. Shortly after, the steam generator, which had occupied the flat end of the locomotive's long hood, was replaced with a diesel HEP generator, and the units were reclassified as GP40PH. They would later be rebuilt as GP40PH-2 units in 1991–92. Southern Pacific ordered a Dash-2 variant of the GP40P; only three of these were ever built. After the conclusion of passenger service, they were repurposed for freight use. All three units are still in service, with two being sent to the Union Pacific Railroad and the remaining one to the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad.  GP40FH-2  thumb In 1987, New Jersey Transit and Metro-North ordered a set of GP40 locomotives called GP40FH-2s, which were completed by Morrison Knudsen between 1987 and 1990. These locomotives combine the standard cab and frame of a GP40 with the cowl from an ex-Burlington Northern F45 locomotive. A total of 21 units of this type were built; 15 were delivered to New Jersey Transit, and the remaining six were for Metro-North. As of late 2016, only the Metro-North units remain in service, rebuilt as GP40FH-2Ms. All NJT GP40FH-2 locomotives have been retired following the delivery of the ALP-45DP. Five units were rebuilt into MPI MP20B switchers in 2008. Seven NJT units were purchased by Iowa Pacific Holdings and three of those were designated for use on the Hoosier State between Chicago and Indianapolis before Amtrak took over operations again on January 30, 2017. The rest of the units have been sold to various other operators. In July 2018, Metro-North Rail Commuter Council's vice chairman announced that the agency is considering purchasing 15 Siemens SC-44 locomotives to replace the current fleet of locomotives for the Port Jervis Line.  GP40PH-2 Essex Street. 4109 has since been painted into a CNJ heritage scheme. In 1991–92, NJ Transit sent its ex-CNJ GP40PH units out for rebuilding. The units were rebuilt as GP40PH-2 locomotives. New Jersey Transit would later order two more sets of GP40PH-2 units; these units were rebuilt from former freight GP40 units. The first order in 1993 consisted of six units rebuilt by Morrison-Knudsen are designated GP40PH-2A. The second order in 1993–94 was for 19 former Penn Central units rebuilt by Conrail. These units are classified as GP40PH-2B. Metro-North ordered a single GP40PH-2 unit, numbered 4906. It was rebuilt by Conrail in 1992 and is classified as a GP40PH-2M. Starting in 2014, all but two of NJ Transit's original GP40PH-2s have entered an in-house rebuild program by NJ Transit for a mechanical conversion into a standard GP40-2 for non-revenue service. The HEP motor was removed, unlit number boards were drilled in, the rear ladders were removed and replaced with steps, and LED markers were applied to the rear end of the locomotive, replacing their original tri-color class lights. As of 2020, locomotives 4100, 4101 and 4109 are the only ex-CNJ locomotives that remain in service, along with NJ Transit's GP40PH-2B units and Metro-North's GP40PH-2M unit. The GP40PH-2A units were retired upon the delivery of the ALP-45DP, and they have since been stored, except for one unit, which was sold to MARC. In December 2017, New Jersey Transit purchased 17 additional ALP-45DPs to replace the remaining GP40PH-2B locomotives that are still in service.. However, in July 2020, NJ Transit decided to use the ALP-45DPs to replace older locomotives of the PL42AC fleet instead of the GP40PH-2Bs, due to the PL42AC's unreliability and inability to be upgraded to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards.https://www.njtransit.com/press-releases/nj-transit-purchase-eight- additional-dual-powered-locomotives? In 2019, NJ Transit unveiled locomotive 4109 painted in a heritage scheme based on that of the CNJ GP40P. 4109, formerly used as a work engine, has since re-entered revenue service.https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/10/08-nj-transit-provides- more-details-on-heritage-units  GP39H-2  Odenton In the late 1980s, Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt six GP40s into 12-cylinder GP39s for MARC. They were downgraded from to , and re-equipped with 4-stroke Cummins HEP generators. As of 2015, they continue to be used by MARC for smaller train sets and work train duty.  GP40WH-2  MARC GP40WH-2 No. 52 at Camden Station, Baltimore, Maryland In 1993, Morrison-Knudsen was contacted by the Maryland Transit Administration to assemble a fleet of GP40s for use on MARC. They entered service in 1994. GP40WH-2s are equipped with a Cummins head-end power generator. The Federal Railroad Administration exempted these units from the \\"triangular light pattern\\" rule because the engines were ordered with Gyralites before the mandatory use of ditch lights. Since being retired by MARC, most of these units have been rebuilt by MotivePower into MP32PH-Q locomotives for use on SunRail.  GP40-2H  New Haven Union Station In 1996, AMF Technotransport rebuilt six freight locomotives into passenger locomotives for the Connecticut Department of Transportation for use on Shore Line East service. The locomotives, designated GP40-2H, were rebuilt from ex- CSX Transportation EMD GP38s and EMD GP40s. The rebuild included an EMD 645 prime mover, producing , and a separate head-end power (HEP) generator. Following an overhaul performed by National Railway Equipment that began in March 2017,http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2017/03/20-nre-to-overhaul- connecticut-dot-commuter-rail-locomotiveshttp://www.ttmg.org/blog/tag/gp40-2h/ all six units were re-designated as GP40-3H and transferred to the newly established Hartford Line service, where they remain in service as of June 2018, though they are still occasionally seen on Shore Line East. Eventually, all other Shore Line East equipment will be moved into service on the Hartford Line once CDOT has sufficient M8 electric multiple units to operate on Shore Line East service.  GP40MC  MBTA GP40MC No. 1136 at Porter Square Station in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2007 The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority currently owns and operates a set of 25 GP40 passenger diesels known as GP40MCs. They were originally built as GP40-2LWs for Canadian National in 1973-75. In 1997-98, these units were extensively rebuilt by AMF. Although they have been principally used on the lines from North Station, these locomotives can also be seen commonly on the South Station lines. Currently, the GP40MCs are undergoing an overhaul by the Norfolk Southern Railway, which includes repair and modification to the major propulsion systems and the HEP generators. Since late 2015, the GP40MCs have been mostly replaced by the MPI HSP46, but a handful remain in service. *  See also  *List of GM-EMD locomotives *List of GMD Locomotives  References   Further reading  *  External links  Category:B-B locomotives GP40-based passenger diesels GP40-based passenger diesels Category:Passenger locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Canada Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Canada ","title":"EMD GP40-based passenger locomotives"},{"id":"3396490","text":"Gille Chlerig,1 also Gillocheri 2 or Gillocher, Gillocher or Gylocher is a Gaelic name attested only in a Latin source, a 13th-century forgery designed to advance the cause of Scottish independence.

It was a part of the Venetian-Genoese Wars. The war had mixed results. Venice and her allies won the war against their Italian rival states, however lost the war against King Louis the Great of Hungary, which resulted in the Hungarian conquest of Dalmatian cities. Background The two maritime powers, Genoa and Venice, had long been leading commercial powers with ties to Constantinople that had nurtured their growth during the Early Middle Ages. Their rivalry over trade with the Levant had generated a number of wars. Genoa, having suffered previous defeats at the hands of the Venetians, had emerged from submission to the Visconti tyrants of Milan during the 14th century, although it had also been severely weakened by the Black Death of 1348 which took a toll of 40,000 on the city. Venice had participated in the dismemberment of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 and gradually taken over land on the Adriatic, entering into conflict with Hungary; on the Italian mainland, its terrestrial acquisition had generated a rivalry with the nearby largest city, Padua. Genoa wanted to establish a complete monopoly of trade in the Black Sea area (Consisting of grain, timber, fur, and slaves). In order to do so it needed to eliminate the commercial threat posed by Venice in this region. Genoa felt compelled to initiate the conflict because of the collapse of Mongol Hegemony over the Central Asian Trade Route which had hitherto been a significant source of wealth for Genoa. When the Mongols lost control of the area, trade became much more hazardous and far less profitable. Hence Genoa's decision to go to war to insure its trade in the Black Sea area remained under its control. Allies Genoa's allies included Hungary and Padua. The King of Hungary, Louis I, had conquered Dalmatia from Venice and by 1379 Hungarian forces threatened Venice itself by land from the north. Paduan forces, under the leadership of Francesco I da Carrara, cut off Venice's communications to the west. Genoa's allies also included the Patriarch of Aquileia and Leopold III, the Duke of Austria. The danger on land seemed trifling to Venice so long as she could keep the sea open to her trade and press the war against the Genoese in the Levant. Venice's allies, which included Bernabò Visconti of Milan, gave her little help on this side, although his mercenaries invaded the territory of Genoa. The Milanese troops were indeed defeated in September 1379 in the Val Bisagno. Bernabò, whose despotism and taxes had enraged the Milanese, was deposed by his nephew Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1385. Imprisoned in the castle of Trezzo, he was poisoned in December of that year. Venice had the support of John V Palaiologos, Byzantine Emperor. In 1376, the Genoese helped Andronikos IV overthrown John V, but in 1379 Venice restored the latter to the throne. Tenedos Part of the Venetian fortress on Tenedos (Bozcaada) The war was primarily fought over control of the island of Tenedos in the Aegean Sea, and both sides supported different claimants to the throne of the Byzantine Empire. Tenedos had been acquired by Venice from the Byzantine Empire in 1377, but after this conflict, they ceded it to Savoy and evacuated it in 1381. The Pope decided that the castle on Tenedos should be demolished, rather than be a source of contention between the two cities; 4000 Greek islanders from Tenedos were resettled in Crete and Euboea. Cape d'Anzio (May 30, 1378) During the first stage of the war the plans of the senate were carried out with general success. While Carlo Zeno harassed the Genoese stations in the Levant, Vettor Pisani brought one of their squadrons to action on 30 May 1378 off Cape d'Anzio to the south of the Tiber, and defeated it. The battle was fought in a gale by 10 Venetian against 11 Genoese galleys. The Genoese admiral, Luigi de' Fieschi, was taken with 5 of his galleys, and others were wrecked. Four of the squadron escaped, and steered for Famagusta in Cyprus, then held by Genoa. If Pisani had directed his course to Genoa itself, which was thrown into a panic by the defeat at Anzio, it is possible that he might have dictated peace, but he thought his squadron too weak, and preferred to follow the Genoese galleys which had fled to Famagusta. Traù (1378) Pisani returned to the Adriatic and with a fleet of 25 galleys destroyed the port of Sebenico (Šibenik) and headed towards Traù (Trogir), where 22 Genoese galleys were found, commanded by Luciano Doria. Pisani attacked Traù, but the port, heavily fortified, resisted his attack. The Venetians, suffering damage themselves, withdrew to Venice. Battle of Pola (May 7, 1379) The next spring (1379) the Venetians attempted to attack Traù again, but were repelled. During the summer of 1379 Pisani was employed partly in attacking Genoa in Cyprus, but mainly in taking possession of the Istrian and Dalmatian towns which supported the Hungarians from fear of the aggressive ambition of Venice. He was ordered to winter on the coast of Istria, where his crews suffered from exposure and disease. Genoa, having recovered from the panic caused by the disaster at Anzio, decided to attack Venice at home while the best of her ships were absent with Carlo Zeno. The Ligurian republic sent a strong fleet into the Adriatic under Luciano Doria. Pisani had been reinforced early in the spring of 1379, but when he was sighted by the Genoese fleet of 25 sail off Pola in Istria on the May 7, he was slightly outnumbered, and his crews were still weak. The Venetian admiral would have preferred to avoid battle, and to check an attack on Venice itself, by threatening the Genoese fleet from his base on the Istrian coast. He was forced into battle by the commissioner (proveditore) Michele Steno, who as agent of the senate had authority over the admiral. The Venetians were defeated with the loss of all their galleys except six. Luciano Doria fell in the battle, and the Genoese, who had suffered severely, did not at once follow up their success. When Pisani returned home, he was thrown into prison. However, he was later released when the city of Venice was threatened by the Genoese at the Battle of Chioggia. Lido and Brondolo (July 1379) Lido and Venice. On the arrival of Pietro Doria, with reinforcements, the Genoese appeared off the Lido, the outer barrier of the lagoon of Venice, in July, and in August they entered on a combined naval and military attack on the city, in combination with the Paduans under the Carraresi and the Hungarians. The Venetians had closed the passages through the outer banks except at the southern end, at the island of Brondolo, and the town of Chioggia. The barrier here approaches close to the mainland, and the position facilitated the co-operation of the Genoese with the Paduans and Hungarians, but Chioggia is distant from Venice, which could only be reached along the canals across the lagoon. The Venetians had taken up the buoys which marked the fairway, and had placed a light squadron on the lagoon. The allies soon occupied Brondolo. Battle of Chioggia (August 1379–June 1380) The town of Chioggia This wider conflict takes its name from the fishing port town of Chioggia, which had a Venetian garrison of 3,000 men. The Genoese were reinforced by the Hungarians and Paduans, and suddenly and unexpectedly they attacked the south end of the lagoon, brought her fleet into the channels of the lagoon and, with her allies, stormed and captured Chioggia on 16 August 1379. By mid-August 1379 the allies had Venice encircled. The Venetian senate applied for peace, but when the Genoese replied that they were resolved to \\"bit and bridle the Horses of Saint Mark\\" the Venetians decided to fight to the end. All Venetian reserves were mobilized and Vittor Pisani, imprisoned after the battle of Pola, was released by popular demand. During the night of 22 December 1379, under cover of darkness, the doge of Venice Andrea Contarini and Pisani blockaded Chioggia. They thus cut off the occupying forces from both the Paduans and the Genoese fleet. After launching this diversionary attack on Chioggia, the Venetians managed to sink obstructions closing every channel by which the Genoese fleet might escape from the cul-de-sac at Chioggia. The Venetian galley fleet that had been on a raiding expedition in the Mediterranean reached the anchorage off Brondolo on January 1, 1380; this fleet was under the command of Carlo Zeno, who had left on a plundering expedition before the battle of Pola and had been inflicting damage on Genoese trade in the Tyrrhenian and Aegean seas as far as Beirut and Rhodes. Zeno returned home in time to join the blockade of Chioggia. It was the Genoese who now were encircled. The attack on Genoese-held Chioggia was now pressed with vigour. The Genoese held out resolutely in the hope of relief from home. Months of skirmishes followed. The Genoese attempted to clear the barricades in the channels and the Venetians to defend them. Genoese also failed in an attempt to subdue the mercenaries employed by the Venetians who were besieging them. The heavy Genoese vessels were much hampered by the shallow water and intricate passages through the lagoon. By taking advantage of their embarrassment and his own local knowledge, Pisani carried out a series of movements which entirely turned the tables on the invaders. Pisani executed a succession of night attacks, during which he sank vessels laden with stones not only in the canals leading through the lagoon to Venice, but in the fairways leading from Chioggia to the open sea round both ends of the island of Brondolo. The Genoese were thus shut in at the very moment when they thought they were about to besiege Venice. Pisani stationed the galleys under his command in the open sea outside Brondolo, and during the rest of the year blockaded the enemy closely. The distress of the Venetians themselves was great, but the Doge Andrea Contarini and the nobles set an example by sharing the general hardships, and taking an oath not to return to Venice till they had recovered Chioggia. But the resources of Genoa had been taxed to fit out the squadrons she had already sent to sea. It was not until the 12th of May 1380 that her admiral, Matteo Maruffo, was able to reach the neighbourhood of Brondolo with a relieving force. By this time the Venetians had recovered the island, and their fleet occupied a fortified anchorage from which they refused to be drawn. Maruffo could do nothing, and on 24 June 1380 the defenders of Chioggia surrendered. The naval Battle of Chioggia took place on June 24, 1380 in the lagoon off Chioggia, resulting in a victory for Venice. The Genoese, near starvation, surrendered and thus allowed the Venetians to regain control of the Adriatic. Peace of Turin (1381) Through the mediation of the \\"Green Count\\" of Savoy, Amadeus VI, the two sides made a peace treaty at Turin. It gave no formal advantage to Genoa or Venice. But it spelled the end of their long competition: Genoese shipping was not seen in the Adriatic after Chioggia. This conflict saw the first use of shipborne cannons in support of amphibious assault operations and perhaps against Genoese galleys. The conflict was nearly disastrous for both sides, and Genoa was certainly crippled. Genoa lost the naval ascendency that the city-state had enjoyed prior to the war.Henry S. Lucas, The Renaissance and the Reformation (Harper & Bros.:New York, 1960) p. 42. Venice might have suffered as badly, were it not for its admirals Vettor Pisani and Carlo Zeno. She regained her strength and continued to impressive maturity until her defeat by the League of Cambrai in 1508.

Brown was a classic boxer and a knockout puncher. Known as the 'Creole Clouter' and Joe 'Old Bones' Brown, he was managed by Lou Viscusi and named The Ring's 'Fighter of the Year' for 1961. Brown was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1978, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1996. Early life and career Born into poverty in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA, on May 18, 1926, Brown started work as a grocery assistant, moved into carpentry and then embarked on his professional boxing career at the age of seventeen. He made his professional debut on January 15, 1943, at Victory Arena in New Orleans against Ringer Thompson, winning the four-round bout on points. Brown had another six fights, one of which was winning a four-round decision against Leonard Caesar on September 3, 1943, before he was drafted into the United States Navy during World War II. While in the Navy, Brown captured the All-Service Lightweight Championship before being honorably discharged from the Navy in 1945. The resumption of Brown's career was initially disappointing and he frequently fought in undercard matches at Coliseum Arena or Pelican Stadium. One fight saw Brown suffering a third-round knock-out by Melvin Bartholomew in July 1945. After this fight, Brown did not fight again until January 1946, when he lost on a decision over five rounds to Leonard Caesar. Some reward came a mere seven days later when Brown out-pointed Johnny Monroe, but his career over the following three years was, at best, checkered. The impetus for Brown's ultimate success seems to have been provided by a crushing defeat at the hands of the future National Boxing Association Welterweight Champion, Johnny Bratton, late in 1948, immediately followed by a short spell away from the ring. In 1949, Brown actually went unbeaten and, over the next seven years, he steadily climbed the Lightweight rankings, defeating along the way such notable boxers as Virgil Akins, Isaac Logart and Teddy 'Redtop' Davis. These fruitful times were not, however, without their difficulties. The skilful Brown, standing a lanky 5 feet 7½ inches, with a long reach and solid left hand, came to be viewed as dangerous – too dangerous by some astute managers who frequently appeared to steer their charges away from meeting him. Several times, Brown quit in despair during his thirteen-year wait for a shot at the title. World Champion Brown earned his chance for the Lightweight Championship of the World by out-pointing the reigning champion, Wallace 'Bud' Smith in a non-title bout held in Houston, Texas, in May 1956. Four months later, on August 24 and in front of his home crowd at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans, Brown defeated Smith by way of a split decision over fifteen hard-fought rounds. Confirmation of Brown's superiority came early in the following year when, defending the Championship for the first time, he knocked Smith out in eleven rounds.Details of Brown's ring record and Championship fights from: (i) The Ring Record Book & Boxing Encyclopedia 1959 (Nat Fleischer, The Ring Book Shop Inc., 1959), pages 5, 301 & 896\\\\. (ii) The Cyber Boxing Zone . (iii) The Boxing Records Archive . Unusually, this source lists Brown's exhibitions dated October 17, 1952, and April 7, 1958, as being official bouts, while crediting him with a victory on October 10, 1952, that is recorded elsewhere as a seventh round defeat. Once Champion, Brown hoped that his newly acquired status would confer the riches and popular recognition denied to him for so long. Yet, as George Gainford (manager of the charismatic and handsome Sugar Ray Robinson) noted, the name 'Joe Brown' was hardly inspirational. Realising this, Brown attempted to solve his problems by billing himself as Joe 'Old Bones' Brown. The gimmick worked and he became something of a draw for the remainder of his Championship career. In all, Brown made eleven successful defences of his title against ten boxers, and remained Champion for almost six years. After demolishing Smith, Brown beat Orlando Zulueta, Joey Lopes, Ralph Dupas, Kenny Lane, Johnny Busso, Paolo Rosi, Cisco Andrade, Bert Somodio and Dave Charnley (twice). Brown's re-match with Charnley, was named The Ring's Fight of the Year for 1961. Nemesis came in the form of the great Carlos Ortiz from Puerto Rico. Ortiz – intelligent, agile and ten years Brown's junior – stepped down from the Junior Welterweight division where he had been king until out-pointed by Duilio Loi, to focus on the richer pickings to be had amongst the world's top Lightweights. He met Brown in Las Vegas on April 21, 1962, and took the ageing Champion's title after fifteen lackluster rounds to begin his own lengthy domination of the division. Beyond glory Brown fought on for another eight years, before retiring in 1970, at the age of 44 with a record of 104 wins, 44 losses and 13 draws with 47 KOs. In reflecting on the close of Brown's career, Henry Cooper has written that there came to be \\"little pride left in his performances\\" as he tried to compensate \\"for all the hungry years when he had been forced to fight for peanuts\\" (Cooper, 1990).Biographical Information from: (i) Henry Cooper's 100 Greatest Boxers (Henry Cooper, Queen Anne Press, 1990). See page 32 for the 'Old Bones' anecdote and page 33 for Cooper's reflections on the twilight of Brown's career. (ii) The Ring Record Book & Boxing Encyclopedia 1959 (Nat Fleischer, The Ring Book Shop Inc., 1959). A cameo of Brown's life and career, including brief details of his military service may be found on page 5. (iii) The International Boxing Hall of Fame's online exhibit provides a very sketchy account indeed of Brown's career, but was used to confirm the date of Brown's induction into that body. Joe Brown later became a trainer in New Orleans, Louisiana, and led some fighters to become professionals, such as Gregory E. Haines, of Slidell, Louisiana. Joe Brown died in New Orleans, USA, on December 4, 1997.

The union took root after a march from Wautoma, Wisconsin, to Madison, Wisconsin that state's capitol to protest the working conditions of the thousands of annual Mexican-American migrant workers who traveled from Texas to Wisconsin each year. This protest march was inspired by the similar march of César Chávez' United Farm Workers (UFW) in California earlier that spring, and the Texas Farmworker march on Austin, Texas of 1966. Obreros Unidos engaged in its first labor action by seeking to organize migrant potato harvest and processing workers in the town of Almond, WI, and received support from the AFL-CIO, Cesar Chavez, and other labor unions. The name means \\"united workers\\" in Spanish. Cucumber organizing Obreros Unidos organized workers in the cucumber harvest in 1967 organizing the mainly Texas-Mexican or Tejano workers of Libby's foods. They came up with a novel organizing strategy which aimed to organize workers in Texas before the actual harvest season in Wisconsin began. Since many of the labor organizers were themselves migrants or former migrants like Jesus Salas, the union spent many months in South Texas organizing workers so that when they moved for recognition in Wisconsin, they had already built the membership required to call for a vote and representation before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC). The WERC was the first labor board to recognize the rights of agricultural workers to collectively bargain at the state level in the Mt. Nebo Fur Farm case in October, 1964. Under federal law agricultural workers were not covered by labor law under the National Labor Relations Act, but in Wisconsin they were protected by state law provisions. Such protections were won for farm workers in California under the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act a decade after the right was recognized for Wisconsin's agricultural workers and tested several times by Obreros Unidos. La Voz Mexicana newspaper The union published \\"La Voz Mexicana\\" as a public service during its years of activity. \\"La Voz\\" or \\"The Voice\\" provided Mexican- American farm workers in Wisconsin with information on minimum wage, worker's compensation, child labor, and health provisions for migratory farm workers as well as information on the various Mexican American civil rights efforts in California and Texas to the primarily interstate workers who harvested cucumbers and canned vegetables in Central and Southeastern Wisconsin. Decline and legacy In the late 1960s the union established a gas and auto- repair co-op, a legal aid office, and other services for migrant workers and members. It also came under the direct control of Cesar Chavez' union, a change in organizational affiliation that many activists wanted but which may have drained its meager resources as Chavez moved the best organizers into positions working to support the California union's grape boycott effort. By 1970, the union broke with Chavez and entered the cannery organizing field, but this move led to a loss of support from the AFL-CIO, and the union rejected an offer to become a Teamster's affiliate union out of loyalty to Chavez even after he had abandoned the union. Although this union lasted only 6 years many of its organizers went on to work for the United Farm Workers grape boycott effort and other Mexican-American organizations in Wisconsin and Texas including United Migrant Opportunity Services, Inc., La Raza Unida Party, and elected and appointed offices in Wisconsin and Texas.

Morcant appears in a line of Men of the North from Old Welsh pedigrees. He was apparently preceded by his father, Cuncar, and succeeded by his son, Coledauc. Nothing else is known of him. However, historians have conjectured that his kingdom may have lain in Gododdin (Lothian), Alt Clut (Strathclyde) or Bryneich (Northumberland) in the late 6th century. Morcant’s first name is a form of Morgan. It is possible that he may therefore be identified with other Morgans found elsewhere in the Life of St. Kentigern and the writings of Nennius: * King Morken, apparently of Alt Clut, the opponent of St. Kentigern, during his early missionary work, who expelled the saint from his kingdom. * King Morcant who almost single- handedly destroyed any hope the Britons of The Old North had of resisting the Anglian invaders during 6th century. He was part of a grand Brythonic alliance, along with King Urien of Rheged, King Riderch Hael of Alt Clut and King Gwallawc Marchawc Trin of Elmet. They were initially extremely successful in driving back the Angles from Bryneich territory, forcing them to vacate Din Guardi – possibly the capital - around 590 and besieging them on Ynys Metcaut (now called Lindisfarne). However, Morcant grew envious of the successes of Urien, and perhaps became uneasy about the prospects of a greatly empowered Rheged after the Angles had been defeated. Treacherously, he had Urien assassinated by a man called Llofan Llaf Difo and the alliance of the Britons of the North collapsed. The Angles broke out from their containment and retook most of the lands they had held before the war to expel them had begun.

He is often known as Morgrund or Morgan. It is possible that Morggán participated in the so-called Revolt of the Earls, a protest by some of the native Scottish nobility at King Máel Coluim IV's trip to France as a vassal of King Henry II of England. It is also possible that he became estranged from the French-speaking king William I, as Morggán's name appears in no royal acts of the latter king's reign. He married Agnes, a patroness of churches. Agnes was probably related to the de Warenne family - the family who married Ada de Warenne to Henry of Scotland and mother of Kings Malcolm IV and William the Lion. Morggán and Agnes had at least one son, Donnchad, who eventually succeeded to become a Mormaer of Mar. Morggán had another two sons, Máel Coluim and James, but they may have been illegitimate - i.e. the product of an uncanonical marriage acceptable in the Celtic system, but not in the Franco-Roman system then gaining favour in Scotland. His daughter Alesta of Mar was married to Alan Fitzwalter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland who was possibly mother to Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland. He appears in royal charters dated as early as 1147. He is attested in the documents for the last time in 1178, and was dead by 1183. References Bibliography * Richard D.

It is an odourless oily liquid. It can bring a sense of enhanced alertness and energy, euphoria and relaxation. Its psychoactive effects are comparable to that of nicotine. Chemistry Arecoline is a base, and its conjugate acid has a pKa ~ 6.8.The Merck Index, 10th Ed. (1983) p.113, Rahway: Merck & Co. Arecoline is volatile in steam, miscible with most organic solvents and water, but extractable from water by ether in presence of dissolved salts. Being basic, arecoline forms salts with acids. The salts are crystalline, but usually deliquescent: the hydrochloride, arecoline•HCl, forms needles, m.p. 158 °C; the hydrobromide, arecoline•HBr, forms slender prisms, mp. 177–179 °C from hot alcohol; the aurichloride, arecoline•HAuCl4, is an oil, but the platinichloride, arecoline2•H2PtCl6, mp. 176 °C, crystallizes from water in orange-red rhombohedrons. The methiodide forms glancing prisms, mp. 173-174 °C.  Pharmacology  Arecoline is the primary active ingredient responsible for the central nervous system effects of the areca nut. Arecoline has been compared to nicotine; however, nicotine acts primarily on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Arecoline is known to be a partial agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, M3 receptors and M4, which is believed to be the primary cause of its parasympathetic effects. Arecoline also acts as an agonist on the nicotinic receptor which may account for its anti-inflammatory activity. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140907 = Effects on nervous system = Arecoline promotes excitation and decreases sleeping time. It also enhances learning and memory. Intraperitoneal administration of arecoline decreases locomotor activity dose-dependently. Arecoline reversed scolopamine induced memory loss. It could also decrease symptoms of depression and schizophrenia https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251 = Effects on cardiovasular system = AN (Areca Nut) is a vasodilator mainly due to the presence of arecoline. It also has anti-thrombosis and anti-atherogenic effects by increasing plasma nitric oxide, eNos, and mRNA expression and decreasing IL-8 along with other downregulations. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251 = Effects on endocrine system = It increases the level of testosterone by stimulating Leydig's cells as well as levels of FSH and LH.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18559981/https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/136738/ It also activates HPA axis and stimulates CRH release. It prevents the dysfunction of B cells of the pancreas from high fructose intake. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251 = Effects on digestive system = Arecoline has the ability to stimulate the digestive system through the activation of musacarinic receptors. Areca nut water extract could increase the contractions of gastric smooth muscle and muscle strips of the duodenum, ileum, and colon significantly. This activity could be caused by arecoline. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251  Uses  Owing to its muscarinic and nicotinic agonist properties, arecoline has shown improvement in the learning ability of healthy volunteers. Since one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is a cognitive decline, arecoline was suggested as a treatment to slow down this process and arecoline administered intravenously did indeed show modest verbal and spatial memory improvement in Alzheimer's patients, though due to arecoline's possible carcinogenic properties, it is not the first drug of choice for this degenerative disease.In many Asian cultures, the areca nut is chewed along with betel leaf to obtain a stimulating effect. Arecoline has also been used medicinally as an antihelmintic (a drug against parasitic worms). Arecoline also increase testosterone in low doses https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18559981/  Toxicity  : 100 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously in mouse. Also, the minimum lethal dose (MLD) values of arecoline in mice, dog and horse is 100mg/kg, 5mg/kg and 1.4 mg/kg respectively. It causes Oral Submucous Fibrosis by stimulating collagen, interleukin 6, keratinocyte growth factor-1, IGF-1, cystatin C, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases in the mouth. Current science is confident that areca nut chewing is carcinogenic. Research suggests this is probably at least partly because of arecoline itself, although it could also be from the other constituents of the nut as well, some of which are precursors to nitrosamines that form in the mouth during chewing.

The Bièvre was diverted from its original course in 1148 by the monks of the abbey of Saint-Victor. This diversion is reflected in maps of Paris dating from the 13th century. Historically the river was heavily industrialized with mills, which led to the straightening of the river. Tanneries, butcher shops and dye-makers were built along its banks, leading to serious pollution concerns. Starting in the 18th century, the river was gradually culverted. Eleven km are canalised under slabs and 5 km have disappeared under rubble and urbanisation in Paris. In modern times the Bièvre forms a rainwater system. Restoration project In 2003, 200m of the Bièvre was re-opened in the Parc des Près in Fresnes.pdf about the Fresnes reopening of the Bievre, at www.onema.fr At the same time, over twenty direct wastewater connections to the Bièvre were eliminated. When the river is completely disconnected from the wastewater system, the stormwater from the river will no longer flow into a wastewater treatment plant but will instead flow directly into the River Seine, which is expected to lead to significant savings in wastewater treatment costs.

Legio VI Herculia was a Roman legion levied by Diocletian in the end of the 3rd century, and was still in service at the beginning of the 5th century. The cognomen of the legion refers to Hercules, to whom Diocletian's colleague, Maximian (also known as Herculius, \\"the man like Hercules\\"), was devoted and identified. In the tetrarchs provincial reforms, the province of Pannonia Inferior was divided into two, the northern part became Pannonia Valeria and the southern part became Pannonia Secunda. However the two legions of the province were stationed in the north at Brigetio and Aquincum leaving the southern province without any legions stationed there. The tetrarchs levied two more legions, Legio VI Herculia and Legio V Iovia. The VI Herculia had her permanent camp in Teutoburgium (near modern Vukovar) and an advanced castellum in Onagrinum. They also protected the imperial residence of Diocletian in Sirmium which was also the provincial capital of the province and the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. The Notitia Dignitatum locates the legion still in Illyricum at the beginning of the 5th century.Notitia Dignitatum, occ XXXII v. 45 \\"praefectus legionis sextae Herculeae cohortis quintae partis superioris Aureo monte\\", v. 47 \\"praefectus legionis sextae Herculeae, Teutiborgio\\", v. 48 \\"praefectus legionis quintae Ioviae et sextae Herculeae in castello Onagrino\\".

Esposito has published over a dozen cookbooks. Personal life She was raised in Buffalo, New York. Her mother was a dietician. Her grandmothers, both professional chefs,Staff (undated). \\"Mary Ann Esposito\\". PBS. Retrieved September 25, 2016. moved to the United States from Italy in the 1890s. Her paternal grandmother, from Sicily, owned a butcher shop in Fairport, New York, and her maternal grandmother lived in Buffalo, where she owned a boarding house. The latter grandmother was from Naples, and continued the traditions of her Italian household within the boarding house. The boarding house was the only house in the neighborhood that had a bathtub, and on Friday nights she would offer neighbors a bath and dinner for a quarter. While her grandmothers provided traditional Italian food, Esposito desired to eat standard foods like other children: Wonder Bread and iceberg lettuce. Esposito, who never intended to pursue a career in cooking, learned to cook from her family. Her grandmothers made bread every day, with Esposito helping to make upwards of twenty loaves of bread a day, canning vegetables and fruits, and helping to prepare ingredients for meals. Eventually, Esposito attended college, where she would graduate with a teaching degree and become an elementary school teacher. In 1979, her mother sent her a pasta maker, and despite a lack of interest in cooking as an adult, Esposito taught herself how to make pasta dough. The following year, she and her husband Guy visited Italy for the first time, visiting his cousins. While in Italy, Esposito started attending a cooking class. She began learning the history of Italian cooking, region by region, and traveling to the country twice a year for cooking lessons. At the University of New Hampshire she took classes to learn how to speak Italian. By 1985, she had joined the history master's program at the university, writing her thesis about Italian Renaissance cooking. Career Esposito started teaching cooking through the University of New Hampshire's Division of Continuing Education. In the mid-1980s, she submitted a proposal for a cooking show to New Hampshire Public Television. The show was delayed production because of the small size of the television station; however, upon moving to a larger station, a pilot was taped. The pilot was a test to not only gauge viewer reception, but, to also see how Esposito would be on camera. On the hottest day of the year in the region, the television crew came to Esposito's home in Durham, New Hampshire, and the pilot was taped. Upon airing, the pilot received great reception and the longest-running television cooking show was born. Esposito has published over a dozen cooking books about Italian cooking and entertaining. Her 1997 book, What You Knead, about breadmaking, was awarded best in category by the International Cookbook Revue and was named one of Food & Wine magazine's top cookbooks of 1997. She makes over forty public appearances a year nationally and has appeared on the Today Show, Regis and Kathie Lee, QVC, the Food Network, Martha Stewart Living Radio, and other programs. She contributed to The Huffington Post and New Hampshire Home. =Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito= Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito, is a thirty-minute cooking show produced for PBS by Esposito's own Mary Esposito Productions, and taped at New Hampshire Public Television. The show features Esposito's recipes and cooking tips, and visits from guest chefs. She also explores the history of Italian cooking and food. Through the show, Esposito seeks to help her viewers learn about new recipes that are \\"doable, authentic, and good.\\" When deciding what to feature on the show, Esposito has four standards: she must like to eat the food, the ingredients should be easy to find, the recipe should be something unique and new to the viewer, and should be manageable by the kitchen staff. Every episode has twenty volunteers who work on the show. An entire season of shows, generally about thirty-two episodes, can be taped within two weeks during the summer, with two to three shows being taped a day. All of the food is made from scratch in the studio, with each dish being prepared in numerous batches and at different recipe stages. This allows Esposito to execute an entire recipe in a matter of minutes that might take hours to complete. All of the recipes are planned by Esposito and the kitchen staff. Volunteers gather all the pertinent ingredients from local markets and go to Boston for specialty foods if unavailable locally. Recipes are prepared the day of the show. Ciao Italia is not scripted. The studio set is loosely based on Esposito's home kitchen. The view out the window of the set is painted to appear as the view of the Oyster River, which is seen from her home kitchen. To prepare for shows, Esposito researches and tests recipes outside the studio. Recognitions A scholarship foundation named after and maintained by Esposito awards scholarships for students seeking financial aid to study culinary arts. Esposito was awarded an honorary degree from St. Anselm College. She has received the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Culinary and Cultural Arts of Italy by the Order Sons of Italy in America. She is in the Hall of Fame for the Italian Trade Commission. On June 2, 2013, a knighthood was bestowed upon her by the President of the Italian Republic under the title Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia (Knight of the Order of the Star of Italy).Staff (undated). \\"Esposito Sig.ra Mary Ann\\" (in Italian).

Pooper-scooper devices often have a bag or bag attachment. 'Poop bags' are alternatives to pooper scoopers, and are simply a bag, usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. Sometimes, the person performing the cleanup is also known as the pooper-scooper. History The invention is credited to Brooke Miller, of Anaheim, California. The design she patented is a metal bin with a rake-like edge attached to a wooden stick. It also includes a rake-like device to scoop the poop into the scooper and a hatch that can be attached to a garbage bag that fits onto the base. The generic term pooper-scooper has been included in dictionaries since the early 1970s. Legislation A number of jurisdictions, including New York City, have laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets: > a) A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog, cat or other animal shall > not permit the animal to commit a nuisance on a sidewalk of any public > place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises > used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building > abutting on a public . Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care & Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets.(1) New York attorney and dog lawyer (2) Such laws are often nicknamed \\"pooper-scooper laws\\", though the laws only stipulate that dog owners remove their dogs' feces, not the method or device used (thus using a hand-held plastic bag to remove feces complies with these laws). Health concerns A sign instructing park-goes to be courteous and pick up after their pet with an image of a pooper-scooper. Dog droppings are one of the leading sources of E. coli (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution, Toxocara canis and Neospora caninum helminth parasite pollution. One gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 E. coli cells.Coliform and E. coli are commonly used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human) While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area can create serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creating health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc. In Germany an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan that would break even at about seven months. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs. In adult dogs, the infection by Toxocara canis is usually asymptomatic but can be fatal in puppies. A number of various vertebrates, including humans, and some invertebrates can become infected by Toxocara canis. Humans are infected, like other paratenic hosts, by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs. The disease caused by migrating T. canis larvae (toxocariasis) results in visceralis larva migrans and ocularis larva migrans. Clinically infected people have helminth infection and rarely blindness.

The party was suspended, but it later joined the Democratic Alliance for Egypt during the 2011-2012 parliamentary election, where it had gained 1 seat in the People's Assembly of Egypt. History and ideology The party established on 9 September 1978 by Ibrahim Shoukry and others. It was originally a socialist party. The party is the successor of the Masr Al Fattah Movement, which was founded by Ahmad Hussain in 1933. Since 1986 the party has undergone a major ideological change turning into an Islamist party. In 1987 the party formed an alliance, called Tahaluf, with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Socialist Liberals Party. This change was first demonstrated in the party's fifth conference in 1989 which was entitled \\"Reform from an Islamic perspective\\".http://el3amal.worldispnetwork.com/ta3reef.htm The party platform calls for: * Establishing an economic system based on the Islamic Shari'ah. * Protecting the national industries. * Equal distribution of investments among the Egyptian governorates. * Achieving unity between Egypt, Sudan and Libya. * Liberating the occupied Palestinian lands. * Promoting ties with developing countries.  1990 elections  The party and a few others abstained from the election because of an amendment to the 1972 Electoral Law forbidding unified lists, with the Socialist Labour Party attempting to combine with the Muslim Brotherhood in hope to change the Muslim Brotherhood's view on Islam in a more leftist way, but this plan failed when they were suspended in 2000. The Muslim Brotherhood and the Labour Party still remain great allies. Sadat's suppression of the party Before the party was anti- Mubarak, it opposed Anwar Sadat heavily through its newspaper and constant protests; this led to most of the head of the party being arrested, which in turn triggered the party's fall in the 1980s. 2000 suspension On 20 May 2000, the Egyptian committee for political parties' affairs (the committee responsible for authorizing the formation of political parties in Egypt) decided to freeze the activities of the Labor Party and suspend its newspaper al Shaab. The committee referred to Article 17 of the political parties law, which enables it to suspend the activities of a party, as a means of stopping any decision or act by a party that is contrary to the higher interests of the country. The committee attributed its decision to the split within the party ranks, with one group led by Hamdi Ahmad, a member of the party’s executive committee, and the other led by Ahmad Idris. The committee, in its decision, referred to the official complaint brought by those members concerning the selection of a new party chair. The two party members also asked for Al-Shaab to be suspended from publication and a freeze to be put on the party’s bank account. Labor Party chairman Ibrahim Shoukry described these demands as illegal.  The split  The Islamic Labour Party was split in June 2011 when some of the leaders of the party created the Arab Unification Party in June 2011. 2011–Present The party became part of the Anti-Coup Alliance following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.  Lawsuit against Islamic parties  The Egyptian Islamic Labour Party is one of the eleven Islamic parties targeted by a lawsuit in November 2014, when an organization named Popular Front for opposing the Brotherhoodization of Egypt sought to dissolve all political parties established \\"on a religious basis.\\" The Alexandria Urgent Matters Court however ruled on 26 November 2014 that it lacked jurisdiction.

Since the signing of the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1995, it has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority. It is adjacent to the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Israeli settlement of Modi'in Illit. Historically a small agricultural village, modern Bil'in is now from the western outskirts of Ramallah. According to Neil Rogachevsky, Bil'in is considered an ideological stronghold of Fatah, and many employees of the Palestinian Authority reside there.Neil Rogachevsky \\"Rent-a-Crowd Fridays in Palestine\\" , the-american-interest.com, Nov–Dec 2010. Court rulings Bil'in is located east of the Green Line. Israel's West Bank barrier split the village in two, separating it from 60 percent of its farmland. In 2004, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion that \\"the construction of the wall by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is contrary to international law\\". In 2005, the local council leader of Bil'in, Ahmed Issa Abdullah Yassin, hired Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard to represent the village in a petition to the High Court of Justice. On 4 September 2007, the Court ordered the government to change the route of the wall near Bil'in. Chief Justice Dorit Beinish wrote in her ruling: \\"We were not convinced that it is necessary for security-military reasons to retain the current route that passes on Bilin's lands.\\" The Israeli Defense Ministry said it would respect the ruling and in 2011 began dismantling a section of the barrier in order to relocate it along an alternative route. In February 2007, the Supreme Planning Council (SPC) for Judea and Samaria \\"legalized\\" what Haaretz described at the time as \\"the largest-ever illegal construction project in the West Bank\\", 42 buildings with a total of approximately 1,500 apartments in the Matityahu East neighborhood of the ultra-Orthodox Israel settlement Modi'in Illit by Canadian registered companies Green Park and Green Mount, with two other companies, Ein Ami and Hefziba. The buildings were already in various stages of construction when the SPC announced their decision. In response, Michael Sfard filed a petition on behalf of Peace Now and Bil'in residents at the High Court of Justice (HCJ) requesting a halt to the construction. The HCJ had already ordered that the construction and occupation of the buildings be halted the previous year based on another petition by Peace Now and Bil'in residents. Sfard alleged that the planning authorities, who had refused to hear the claims of Bil'in residents intended to prove land ownership, were aware of the illegality of the construction but did not stop it and that the body administering the relocation of the barrier planned a route in order to obtain hundreds of dunams of Bil'in's agricultural lands for Modi'in Illit's expansion. On September 5, 2007, the day after the HCJ ordered the state to alter the route of a 1.7-kilometer section of the West Bank barrier, the court rejected the petition filed a year and a half earlier concerning Mattityahu East construction, and ruled that the existing buildings could remain, but ordered settlers, the state, and construction companies to pay the petitioners' NIS 160,000 court fees. The petition claimed that some of the land on which the settlement was being constructed was owned by Bil'in residents but the state claims that the land of Matityahu East belongs to the state. Describing the ruling, Haaretz reported that \\"the court based its decision on the fact that the petitions should have been filed several years earlier...the state will not remove the hundreds of settlers who stormed apartments they had purchased, after it became clear that construction company Heftsiba had collapsed...[and] the court apparently has given approval to the existing status quo in the area - the existing part of the neighborhood will remain in place, but plans to expand the neighborhood will not be carried out.\\" Mohammed Khatib, a member of Bil'in's Popular Committee Against the Wall and the secretary of Bil'in's Village Council, said they \\"will continue to challenge these expanding settlements because they threaten the futures of Bil'in and the Palestinian people\\". According to the New Left Review, the settlements around Bil'in are being funded by Israeli businessmen Lev Leviev and Shaya Boymelgreen to promote their political and economic interests. Weekly protests A 2005 protest in Bil'in Since January 2005, the Bil'in Popular Committee against the Wall, led by Iyad Burnat, has been organizing weekly protests against the construction of the West Bank Barrier. The protests have attracted media attention and the participation of many international organizations as well as left-wing groups such as Gush Shalom, Anarchists Against the Wall and the International Solidarity Movement. The protests take the form of marches from the village to the site of the wall with the aim of halting construction and dismantling already constructed portions. Israeli forces always intervene to prevent protesters from approaching the wall, and violence usually erupts in which both protesters and soldiers have been very seriously injured. Some protesters took to wearing gas masks at the protests. , the-american-interest.com, Nov–Dec 2010. The weekly protests, which last a couple of hours, regularly draw international activists who come to support the Palestinian movement. Undercover Israeli soldiers admitted in 2005 to throwing stones at other Israeli soldiers so they could blame it on Palestinians, as an excuse to crack down on peaceful protests by the Palestinians. Chaim Levinson, \\"Undercover Israeli combatants threw stones at IDF soldiers in West Bank\\", Haaretz, 7 May 2012. throwing stones at Bil'in In June 2005 an Israeli soldier lost an eye after being hit by a rock thrown by a demonstrator. In the same incident rubber bullets were used resulting in seven protesters being wounded, one of whom was also hospitalised. Two Bil’in protests in the summer of 2005 are described in detail by Irish journalist David Lynch in his book, A Divided Paradise: An Irishman in the Holy Land.A Divided Paradise: An Irishman in the Holy Land (New Island), David Lynch, Chapter One, Under Fire in Bil'in, pp. 1-31 In August 2006, a demonstration against the 2006 Lebanon War was dispersed by the Israel Border Police using tear gas and rubber coated bullets. An Israeli lawyer, Limor Goldstein, was severely injured after being shot twice. Conferences demonstrating solidarity with the protesters were held in the village in February 2006 and April 2007. Mairead Maguire, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for her work on the Northern Ireland dispute, was hit in the leg by a rubber-coated bullet and reportedly inhaled large quantities of teargas during a demonstration in April 2007.

Abdullah Abu Rahma, coordinator of the Bil'in Popular Committee Against the Wall, was arrested in December 2009 after organizing an exhibit of spent ammunition used against the protesters. He was charged with possession of Israeli arms, incitement and hurling stones at IDF soldiers, and tried before an Israeli military court which found him guilty, according to Amnesty International on 'questionable evidence,' of \\"organizing and participating in an illegal demonstration\\" and \\"incitement\\".\\"Israeli military court extends jail term for Palestinian anti-wall activist\\", Amnesty International, 11 January 2011. Testimony against him was based on allegations, subsequently retracted in court as having been made under duress, by three children that he had encouraged stone-throwing. Desmond Tutu urged Israel to release him. He was due for release on 18 November 2010, was kept in detention, and in January 2010 his year-long sentence was extended for another four months. He served a 15-month sentence in the Israeli prison of Ofer. He has been characterised by David Shulman as an exponent of Gandhian principles of non-violence.David Dean Shulman, \\"Salt march to the Dead Sea: Gandhi's Palestinian reincarnation\\", Harper's, June 2011 edition, page 78. +972 magazine chose him as their person of the year in 2010.\\"+972 Magazine's Person of the Year: Abdullah Abu Rahmah\\", +972 magazine, 30 December 2010. On 15 March 2010, Israeli soldiers entered Bil'in to post notices declaring a closed military zone consisting of the areas between the barrier and the town. The order enforces the closure on Fridays between 0800 and 2000 during which the protests occur. While the closure does not apply to Palestinian residents of Bil'in, Israeli citizens and internationals are forbidden from entering the zone. A film portraying the protests shot from the perspective of the people of Bil'in over many years starting in 2005 called 5 Broken Cameras, by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi became popular after its release at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, winning the Festival's World Cinema Documentary Directing Award. It was nominated for Best Documentary Feature in the 85th Academy Awards. During Mohammed Barakeh's trial in 2012, undercover soldiers from the IDF testified that they had thrown stones against other IDF soldiers during Bil'in demonstrations.Chaim Levinson, \\"Undercover Israeli combatants threw stones at IDF soldiers in West Bank\\": testimony by commander of the Israeli Prison Service's elite 'Masada' unit sheds light on IDF methods in countering demonstrations against barrier, Haaretz, 7 May 2012. =Deaths= Bassem Abu Rahmeh On 17 April 2009, Bassem Abu Rahmeh, 29, was killed after being struck in the chest by a teargas canister fired by Israeli forces during a protest in Bil'in. His death is depicted in the 2011 film 5 Broken Cameras. B'tselem has stated that three separate videos of the protest in which he was killed show he had neither been acting violently, nor endangering Israeli soldiers' lives, when he was killed. Israel's military prosecutor general closed the investigation in September 2013 stating that there was a lack of evidence. The decision to close the case was appealed by two attorneys, Emily Schaeffer Omer-Man and Michael Sfard, on behalf of the family, who accused the authorities of foot-dragging. On 1 April 2015, Justice Menny Mazuz ruled the State had to submit its response to the petition by 25 May.\\"Six years later, Abu Rahmeh family still fighting for justice\\", Ma'an News Agency, 11 April 2015. Jawaher Abu Rahma On 31 December 2010, Jawaher Abu Rahma, age 36, died following a weekly protest. According to reports she was seriously injured in a tear gas attack during the demonstration. The exact cause of death is disputed. Other reports place her at home at the time of the incident, several hundred meters away. Taken to a hospital in Ramallah after she choked on the gas, she did not respond to treatment and died the following day. Members of the Israeli military (IDF) claimed there was no evidence Rahma participated in the protest, or that tear gas had killed her, and stated that there were irregularities in the Palestinian Authority's medical report on Rahma's death.IDF: No proof Palestinian woman died from tear gas at protest, haaretz.com; accessed 27 January 2016. The IDF soldiers referenced in the stories remain unnamed. Several Jewish Israelis in Tel Aviv who were protesting against the IDF's presumed involvement with the death were arrested by Israeli police on 1 January 2011 outside Israel's Defense Ministry. Jawaher was the sister of Bassem Abu Rahma, a prominent activist in Bil'in who was killed by the IDF in 2009. According to a released medical report \\"there was no clear cause of death, the burial was undertaken via an accelerated procedure, and no post- mortem was performed. The information also reveals that Abu-Rahma was administered an unusual quantity of drugs, used to offer treatment against poisoning, drug overdose, or leukemia.\\"Medical report on death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah, ynetnews.com; accessed 27 January 2016.

A. Posse. Posse grew up in Saint Petersburg the youngest of six children; his brother Konstantin (1847–1928) was a mathematician who wrote a calculus textbook widely used in Russia. Vladimir was intellectually precocious, attending Fyodor Dostoyevsky's public readings and his funeral in 1881. He attended Saint Petersburg University (the philological and juridical faculties), being expelled in 1887; the following year he took a degree in law. In the 1890s, he slowly moved from the narodniks' populism to Marxist social democracy. In early 1899 he took over as editor of Zhizn (Life), previously a moderate populist magazine, in an attempt to merge populism and Legal Marxism. He thought he had an understanding with the leading Legal Marxists, but at the last moment they founded their own magazine, Nachalo (The Beginning). Nachalo, however, was shut down by the government in June 1899, and the Legal Marxists moved to Zhizn, since Posse was willing to forgive and forget. Posse continued to edit the magazine until it was suppressed by the Tsarist government in April 1901. He put his friend Maxim Gorky in charge of the magazine's literary section, giving the 30-year-old Gorky an opportunity to try his hand at editing. In mid-1901, after the suppression of Zhizn, Posse moved to Ireland and then London, where he tried to resume the magazine's publication. Although Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams (then Ariadna Borman)'s attempt to secure funding from Gorky, who was living in exile in Yalta at the time, proved unsuccessful in November 1901, Posse eventually formed the Zhizn Social Democratic Group with V. D. Velichkina and Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich, the latter providing financial and distribution support. The group published another 5 issues of Zhizn in London between April and August 1902. The last issue, dated September–December 1902, was published in Geneva in December 1902. Between May 15 and December 12, 1902 (Gregorian calendar), Posse also edited and published (as \\"F. Rosin\\") twelve issues of a companion magazine, Listki Zhizni (Leaflets of Life), which he called a \\"non-factional Social-Democratic organ\\", in London . He also edited several volumes in the irregular Zhizn Library series, also published in 1902. The Zhizn Social Democratic Group ceased to exist and publication stopped when Bonch-Bruevich had a falling out with Posse and left the group, joining Iskra, a rival Social Democratic publication, and taking his distribution network with him. Bonch-Bruevich also transferred 19 manuscripts from Zhizn's portfolio to Iskra against the wishes of the Zhizn Group, which caused a controversy in early 1903. In 1905 the Odessa publisher Burevestnik issued his translation of August Bebel's Die Frau und der Sozialismus (Woman and Socialism). Posse returned to Russia after the Revolution of 1905 and continued working as an editor, apparently rejecting young Isaac Babel's early stories. He published an autobiography, Perezhitoe i produmannoe. Molodost'. 1864-1894 (Meditations about the Past: Youth, 1864–1894), in 1933, which was privately criticized by his one time friend and protégé Gorky for its supposed multiple omissions and inaccuracies.

It was founded in 1946 as Southwestern Bible College in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and was the first Pentecostal educational institution in the state. While it was established as a Bible college for the training of Christian church leaders within the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, the denomination planned to quickly expand the school into a junior college. History By the 1960s the college had developed a junior college program (becoming accredited in 1964) and was able to open its doors to an expanding student body. During this time it began a steady growth as one of the largest junior colleges in the country and the largest within the Pentecostal Holiness Church. These broad changes resulted in various buildings being built (Light Library, Irwin Learning Center, Mabee Science Center, and the Mash Loflin Field House) and degree offerings saw the name shifting to Oklahoma City Southwestern College (OCSC) to better reflect the scope of the expanded school. However, in 1981 the governing body of the denomination decided to re- focus the goals of the institution. The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ended the school's junior college plan and scaled back the institution to an abbreviated form of its original design. As a result, it became a Ministry training college. In addition to this they moved to the Oklahoma City suburb of Bethany, Oklahoma. At this time the name changed from Southwestern Bible College to Southwestern College of Christian Ministries (SCCM). In 1998, in response to changing needs, the school implemented a five-year program to change the direction of the school. A Master of Ministry graduate program was developed and added in this time period. As a result of these combined changes, in 2001 the school, Southwestern Christian University, was granted a name change by the North Central accrediting body. An integral part of Oklahoma City history for over half a century, SCU developed beyond the parameters of just a Bible college to become a full Christian liberal arts university. Accreditation and approval SCU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. It is approved by the General Department of Church Education Ministries of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church for training ministers, missionaries, and Christian workers and is approved by the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) to offer Bible and theology courses for teacher certification for Christian day schools.  Athletics  Southwestern Christian teams, nicknamed athletically as the Eagles, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC).

Fraker and a musical score by Lalo Schifrin. The film has elements of political satire and science fiction, including themes concerning modern ethics and privacy, specifically the intrusion of the telecommunications monopoly, working with the U.S. government, into citizens' private lives. The film was released theatrically on December 21, 1967. Although initially not a commercial success, the film was reviewed favorably, eventually achieving cult film recognition. Plot Psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Schaefer is chosen by the U.S. government to act as the president’s top-secret personal psychoanalyst, from a referral by Don Masters, a Central Enquiries Agency (CEA) assassin who vetted Schaefer while undergoing his own psychoanalysis. The decision to choose Schaefer is against the advice of Henry Lux, the diminutive director of the all-male Federal Bureau of Regulation (FBR). (\\"Lux\\" resembles \\"Electrolux,\\" which like \\"Hoover\\", was once a famous make of vacuum cleaner.) Schaefer is given a home in affluent Georgetown and assigned a comfortable office connected to the White House by a secret tunnel. From this location he is to be on call at all hours, to fit the president's hectic schedule. However, the president's analyst has a unique problem: there is no one with whom he can talk about the president's top-secret and personal problems. As he steadily becomes overwhelmed by stress, Schaefer begins to feel that he is being watched everywhere until he becomes clinically paranoid; he even suspects his sweet girlfriend Nan of spying on him as an agent of the CEA. All of Schaefer's paranoid suspicions eventually turn out to be true. Still worse, Schaefer has a habit of talking in his sleep. Schaefer goes on the run with the help of a \\"typical\\" American family who defend him against foreign agents attempting to kidnap him off the street. He escapes with the help of a hippie tribe led by the \\"Old Wrangler\\", as spies from many nations attempt to kidnap him for the secret information that the president has disclosed to him. Meanwhile, agents from the FBR seek him on orders to '\\"liquidate\\" him as a national security risk. Eventually, Schaefer is found and kidnapped by Canadian Secret Service agents masquerading as a British pop group. Schaefer is rescued from the Canadians and an FBR assassin by Kropotkin (Severn Darden), a Russian KGB agent who intends to spirit him away to the Soviet Union. Kropotkin has second thoughts about his plan following a psychoanalysis session with the doctor during which Kropotkin begins to come to terms with his unrealized hatred of his KGB-chief father. Now feeling that he needs the doctor's help to continue his self-analysis, he instead returns him to U.S. soil. Kropotkin arranges a pickup with his trusted CEA colleague Don Masters, but Schaefer is kidnapped again, this time by TPC (The Phone Company), a far more insidious organization than the FBR or KGB, which had been secretly observing him. Taken to TPC headquarters in New Jersey, he is introduced to its leader, who wants Schaefer's help in carrying out their plan for world domination. As the TPC leader makes his presentation, a camera closeup reveals electronic cables connected to one of his feet, revealing that he is actually an animatronic robot. TPC has developed a \\"modern electronic miracle\\", the Cerebrum Communicator (CC), a microelectronic device that can communicate wirelessly with any other CC in the world. With the CC implanted in the brain, a user need only think of the phone number to be called, and is instantly connected, thus eliminating the need for The Phone Company's massive and expensive wired infrastructure. For this to work, every human being will be assigned a number instead of a name, and will have the CC implanted prenatally. Schaefer is to be forced to assist the TPC scheme by blackmailing the president to pushing through the required legislation. Masters and Kropotkin use their superspy abilities to come to Schaefer's rescue. They hand Schaefer an M16 rifle that he gleefully uses on The Phone Company's security staff. The trio emerge victorious from the ensuing bloodbath, but months later, as Schaefer and his spy friends are enjoying a Christmas reunion, animatronic executives from TPC are seen staring approvingly at a secret monitor, while \\"Joy to the World\\" plays in the background.

Years later, Flicker met Coburn at a Christmas party, where he showed Coburn the script of a film that the screenwriter wished to direct. Coburn had just made Waterhole #3 for Paramount, and showed the script to Robert Evans, who loved it. A deal for production was made in five days. It was the first movie Evans greenlit as the new head of Paramount Studios. Evans claimed that during production of the film, he was visited by FBI agents who told him that the agency did not want the film to be made because of its unflattering portrayal of the FBI. Evans refused, but when pressured by his studio, he changed the \\"FBI\\" to \\"FBR\\", and \\"CIA\\" to \\"CEA\\" by redubbing the voice track slightly out of sync. Evans believed that his telephone was monitored by the FBI (or the phone company) from that point on.Evans, Robert (2006). The Kid Stays in the Picture. Phoenix Books, p. 133. The film's opening credits include a disclaimer that it was made without cooperation from the FBI or CIA. The musical band of hippies led by McGuire was a Los Angeles rock group called Clear Light. They evolved from the band Brain Train and had recently been signed to Elektra Records when they were cast in the film, with a few band members given lines of dialogue. However, the band soon replaced its vocalist. (Cliff DeYoung joined the band as singer after the film was made and was their lead singer on their sole album; McGuire had played that part in the film.) The band released just one album and three singles before breaking up. Reportedly, the role was originally offered to the Grateful Dead, but they turned it down.Garcia: An American Life, by Blair Jackson The ship used by the Canadian Secret Service was John Wayne's personal yacht, the Wild Goose. Critical reception The film was a commercial failure, but received positive reviews from critics. , it holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Deleted scenes Some television prints and videocassette versions of the film were missing some of the songs written and performed by Clear Light with Barry McGuire, with the songs replaced with generic stock instrumental music because of music copyright issues. The 2004 DVD release restored the songs. A scene missing from current editions of the film involves Schaefer meeting his lover Nan seemingly by chance at a 1960s-style underground movie.

The KHD describes itself as a \\"non-party patriotic citizens' initiative\\". It adopts the tradition of the German-Austrian paramilitary forces during the Austrian-Slovene clashes in Carinthia in the aftermath of World War I. As an officially approved traditions association it receives direct funding by the Carinthian state. History After World War I the provisional Carinthian state assembly on 11 November 1918 declared the accession of the former Duchy of Carinthia as a whole to the newly established Republic of German-Austria, while the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (SHS) raised claims to southern Carinthian territories with a predominantly Slovene-speaking population and had begun to occupy the lands south of the Drava river. On December 5 the Carinthian state assembly decided to array paramilitary Heimwehr troops, whose armed resistance led to several clashes of arms (Abwehrkampf), until a ceasefire was mediated by a US commission under Lt. Col. Sherman Miles on 14 January 1919. According to the Treaty of Saint- Germain signed on 10 September 1919, the Meža valley and the Jezersko region were allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In all other Carinthian territories occupied by Yugoslav troops the treaty ordered that a referendum should be held on 10 October 1920, whether the local population would join the Austrian Republic or the SHS-state. Beforehand the paramilitary fighters, organised in the Kärntner Heimatdienst, strongly agitated against the Yugoslav claims. On October 10, a majority of 59,04% of voters in the district decided for the accession to Austria, determining the border as it exists up to today with Slovenia. After its triumph, the Heimatdienst organization, renamed Kärntner Heimatbund (KHB) in 1924, developed aggressive anti-Slovene, anti-Slavic, pan-German, antisemitic, and anti-communist policies and also served as a platform for the illegal Nazi Party in the First Austrian Republic. After World War II the Kärntner Heimatdienst was re- established in 1957, by its own admittance \\"in order to strengthen the love and loyalty for the Carinthian home and the Austrian motherland\\". It was able to exert influence on Carinthia's political parties during various public campaigns against Slovene minority rights, such as violent attacks against bilingual German-Slovene traffic signposts in 1972, agitations for the minority census in 1976, or for the abolition of bilingual primary education in 1988. Today Ulrichsberg memorial service, 2006 The organization claims a membership of about 20,000, including some influential members of right-wing political parties, such as the Freedom Party of Austria and the Alliance for the Future of Austria. Since the late 1990s the association has tried for a rapprochement in several round table talks with organizations of the Carinthian Slovenes. In 2005 this dialogue group (Konsensgruppe) reached a provisional agreement on coexistence including the installation of bilingual name signs wherefore it was awarded the European Citizens' Prize in 2008. The KHD is nevertheless reproached with proximity to far-right politics and continuous contempt for the Slovene minority rights, while the Austrian State Treaty of 1955 in its Article Seven states that organizations aiming to divest any minority rights should be prohibited. In recent years it has been in pursuit of more general populist issues like Islamophobia, the opposition to multiculturalism, or the resistance against war reparations. The association is also a founding member of the Ulrichsberg Memorial Association (Verein für die Heimkehrergedenkstätte Ulrichsberg) which organises an annual memorial service held by World War II veterans and expellees at the Ulrichsberg, a prominent hill overlooking the historic Zollfeld plain north of the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt. The event has been regularly attended by former Waffen-SS (HIAG) members and far-right activists, the former Carinthian governor Jörg Haider delivered some of his most controversial speeches here. In 2009 Austrian Defence Minister Norbert Darabos cancelled any active support by the Austrian Bundesheer.

He was the youngest son and heir of Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Wu. He is also known as the Prince of Kuaiji or (less frequently) Marquis of Houguan (), which were his successive titles after he was deposed in 258 by the regent Sun Chen. He was succeeded by his brother Sun Xiu, who managed to oust Sun Chen from power and kill him. Two years after Sun Liang's dethronement, he was falsely accused of treason and demoted from a prince to a marquis, after which he committed suicide. Early life Sun Liang was born in 243, to Sun Quan and one of his favourite consorts, Consort Pan. As Sun Quan's youngest son, he was well-cared for by his father, who was very happy to have a son in his old age (61 at the time of Sun Liang's birth). He was also born in a palace atmosphere where officials were aligning themselves with either of his two older brothers who were fighting for supremacy – Sun He, the Crown Prince, and Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu, who had designs on the position. In 250, fed up with Sun Ba's constant attacks against Sun He, Sun Quan inexplicably ordered Sun Ba to commit suicide and deposed Sun He. At the urging of his eldest daughter Sun Luban, who had been making false accusations against Sun He and his mother Lady Wang and therefore wanted to see Sun He deposed, he made Sun Liang the new Crown Prince. Sun Luban then had Sun Liang married to a grandniece of her husband, Quan Cong. In 251, Sun Quan instated Sun Liang's mother, Consort Pan, as the Empress. In 252, Sun Liang lost both his parents in rapid succession. Early that year, Empress Pan was murdered – but how she was murdered remains a mystery. Eastern Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including Hu Sanxing, who annotated Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, believed that top Eastern Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as empress dowager after Sun Quan's death. Later that year, Sun Quan died so Sun Liang became the new emperor. Reign = Zhuge Ke's regency = Prior to his death, Sun Quan had selected Zhuge Ke as the regent for Sun Liang, at the endorsement of his trusted assistant Sun Jun. The people of the empire also greatly admired Zhuge Ke, as he was already known for his military and diplomatic successes involving the indigenous Baiyue and for his quick wit. However, Sun Quan's only reservation – that Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinion of his own abilities – would turn out to be prophetic. In 252, in light of Sun Quan's death, the Cao Wei regent Sima Shi made a major three-pronged attack against Eastern Wu. Zhuge Ke's forces, however, were able to defeat the main Cao Wei forces, inflicting heavy losses. Zhuge Ke's reputation became even more established. In 253, he carried out a plan he had for a while – to gather up nearly all service-eligible young men of Eastern Wu to make a major attack against Cao Wei – despite opposition from a number of other officials. He further coordinated his attack with Jiang Wei, a general from Eastern Wu's ally state Shu Han. However, his strategy turned out to be faulty – he initially targeted Shouchun (壽春; in present-day Lu'an, Anhui) but, on his way, changed his mind and attacked Hefei instead, despite the fact that Hefei's defences were strong and intended to withstand major Eastern Wu attacks. Zhuge Ke's forces became worn out by the long siege and suffered plagues – which Zhuge Ke ignored. He eventually withdrew after Cao Wei reinforcements arrived, but instead of returning to the capital Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) to apologise for his erroneous strategies, he remained from the capital for some time and never apologised to the people for the heavy losses suffered. When Zhuge Ke eventually did return to Jianye, he further sternly tried to wipe out all dissent, punishing all those who disagreed with him. He further planned another attack against Cao Wei, disregarding the recent heavy losses the people had suffered and their resentment. Sun Jun decided that he had to kill Zhuge Ke. He told Sun Liang that Zhuge Ke was plotting treason, and he set up a trap at a feast for Zhuge Ke. (How much the young emperor knew of Sun Jun's plans and whether he concurred is unclear; traditional historians implied that Sun Liang knew and concurred, but he was just 10 years old at this point.) During the middle of the feast, assassins that Sun Jun had arranged for killed Zhuge Ke, and Sun Jun's forces then wiped out the Zhuge family. =Sun Jun's regency= After Sun Jun killed Zhuge Ke, he quickly moved to consolidate his power. He initially, on the surface, shared power with Teng Yin, but he, with control of the military, soon became even more dictatorial than Zhuge Ke. In particular, he falsely accused the former crown prince Sun He of conspiring with Zhuge Ke, and forced Sun He to commit suicide. His autocratic actions led to a conspiracy between Sun Ying (), the Marquis of Wu, and the army officer Huan Lü (), but he discovered the plan in 254, and both Sun Ying and Huan Lü were executed. In 255, in the midst of Cao Wei's having to deal with a rebellion by Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin, Eastern Wu forces, led by Sun Jun, tried to attack Cao Wei's border region, but withdrew after Sima Shi quickly put down the rebellion. (Wen Qin and his troops did surrender to him after they were defeated.) Later that year, another plot against Sun Jun was discovered, and a large number of officers were executed, along with Sun Quan's second daughter Sun Luyu, falsely implicated by her elder sister Sun Luban. In 256, Sun Jun, at Wen Qin's urging, was planning an attack against Cao Wei, when he suddenly fell ill, and he commissioned his cousin Sun Chen to succeed him as regent and died soon after. =Sun Chen's regency= Sun Jun's death would precipitate a major confrontation. The general Lü Ju, who was set to lead the main force against Cao Wei, was angry that the autocratic Sun Jun appointed Sun Chen, who had not distinguished himself in any way. Lü Ju openly called for Teng Yin to become regent instead, and Teng Yin agreed to act with him. Sun Chen struck back militarily, and his forces defeated Teng Yin and Lü Ju. Teng Yin and his family were executed, while Lü Ju committed suicide. In light of his defeat of Teng Yin and Lü Ju, Sun Chen began to become extremely arrogant. In 257, at the age of 14, Sun Liang began to personally handle some important matters of state. He established a personal guard corps, consisting of young men and officers with age similar to his, stating that he intended to grow up with them. He also sometimes questioned Sun Chen's decisions. Sun Chen began to be somewhat apprehensive of the young emperor. Later that year, the Cao Wei general Zhuge Dan, believing that the regent Sima Zhao (Sima Shi's brother) was about to usurp the throne, declared a rebellion and requested Eastern Wu assistance. A small Eastern Wu detachment, led by Wen Qin, quickly arrived to assist him, but Sun Chen led the main forces and chose to camp a long distance away from Shouchun, where Zhuge Dan was besieged by Sima Zhao, and did nothing. When Sun Chen instead ordered the general Zhu Yi to try to relieve Shouchun with tired and unfed troops, Zhu Yi refused so Sun Chen executed him, bringing anger from the people, who had admired Zhu Yi's military skills and integrity. With Sun Chen unable to do anything, Zhuge Dan's rebellion failed in 258, and Wen Qin's troops became captives of Cao Wei. =Removal= Sun Chen knew that the people and the young emperor were both angry at him, and chose not to return to Jianye, but instead sent his confidants to be in charge of the capital's defences. Sun Liang became angrier, and plotted with his sister Sun Luban, the general Liu Cheng (), his father-in-law Quan Shang (), and his brother-in-law Quan Ji (), to have Sun Chen overthrown. However, Quan Shang did not keep the plot secret from his wife, who was Sun Chen's cousin, and she told Sun Chen. On 9 November 258, Sun Chen quickly captured Quan Shang and killed Liu Cheng, and then surrounded the palace and forced the other officials to agree to depose Sun Liang – falsely declaring to the people that Sun Liang suffered from psychosis and was therefore incompetent. Sun Liang was demoted to a prince under the title \\"Prince of Kuaiji\\". After removal Sun Chen then made Sun Liang's elder brother, Sun Xiu, the Prince of Langye, the new emperor. Several months later, Sun Xiu set a trap for Sun Chen and had him arrested and killed. However, Sun Liang's position in exile did not become any safer, as Sun Xiu deeply feared that there would be plots to return Sun Liang to the throne. In 260, there were rumours that Sun Liang would be emperor again, and Sun Liang's servants falsely accused him of witchcraft. Sun Xiu demoted Sun Liang to a marquis under the title \\"Marquis of Houguan\\" and sent him to his marquisate in Houguan (present-day Fuzhou, Fujian). Sun Liang died on the journey. While most historians believe that he committed suicide, an alternative theory is that Sun Xiu had him poisoned.

Medieval antiphonaries varied with regional liturgical tradition. In 1570, following the Council of Trent, the Roman Antiphonary was declared universal. The Roman Antiphonary (Antiphonale Romanum) contains the chants for the Divine Office for the hours of Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline for every day of the year. The Vesperale Romanum is an excerpt of the Antiphonary containing the chants sung at Vespers. The music for use at the Mass is contained in the Roman Gradual (Graduale Romanum), the chants of the ordinary are also edited as an excerpt from the Gradual, the Kyriale Romanum. The Antiphonale Romanum was substantially revised in 1910/11 in the course of the reform of the Roman Breviary under Pope Pius X, notably restoring authentic Gregorian melodies. For the 1971 \\"Liturgy of the Hours\\", there are two volumes, Antiphonale Romanum II and Liber Hymnarius. Terminology Alternative terms for Antiphonary are Antiphonal or Antiphony. The term comes from the Latin antiphonarium, antiphonarius, antiphonarius liber, antiphonale, which came from the Greek antíphonon \\"antiphone, anthem\\". In current usage, Antiphonary refers more narrowly to books containing the chants for the Divine Office in distinction to the Gradual (Graduale or more rarely antiphonarium Missarum), which contains the antiphons used for the Mass. The Antiphonary thus included generically the antiphons and antiphonal chants sung by cantor, congregation, and choir at Mass (antiphonarium Missarum, or graduale) and at the canonical Hours ( antiphonarium officii); but now it refers only to the sung portions of the Divine Office or Breviary. Other English equivalents for antiphonary are antiphonar (still in reputable use) and antiphoner (considered obsolete by some English lexicographers, but still sometimes used in the early 20th century). In the \\"Prioress' Tale\\" of Chaucer it occurs in the form antiphonere: :He Alma Redemptoris herde synge / As children lerned hir antiphonere. The word Antiphonary had in the earlier Middle Ages sometimes a more general, sometimes a more restricted meaning. In its present meaning it has also been variously and insufficiently defined as a \\"Collection of antiphons in the notation of Plain Chant\\", and as a liturgical book containing the antiphons \\"and other chants\\". In its present complete form it contains, in plain-chant notation, the music of all the sung portions of the Roman Breviary immediately placed with the texts, with the indications of the manner of singing such portions as have a common melody (such as versicles and responses, the Psalms, the Lessons, the Chapters). But the Lessons of Matins (First Nocturn) in the triduum of Holy Week, styled \\"Lamentations\\", have a melody proper to themselves, which is not therefore merely indicated but is placed immediately with the texts of the Lessons. An old Antiphoner from the Church of St. Francis, Evora, Portugal In order to show as clearly as possible the exact position of the antiphonary amongst the liturgical books, it is proper to recall that the Roman Missal contains all the texts used at Mass; the Roman Breviary, all the texts used in the Divine Office or Canonical Hours. While in the Missal, the introits, graduals, tracts, sequences, offertories, communions, as well as the texts of the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei are both read by the celebrant and sung by the choir, their notation is not given, only the accentus or chants, of the celebrant and deacon have the music furnished (such as the intonations of the Gloria, the Credo, the chants of the various Prefaces, the two forms of the Pater Noster, the various forms of the Ite, or Benedicamus, the Blessing of the Font, etc.). The omitted chants (styled concentus), which are to be sung by the choir, are contained in a supplementary volume called the \\"Graduale\\" or \\"Liber Gradualis\\" (anciently the \\"Gradale\\"). In like manner, the Roman Breviary, practically entirely meant for singing in choro, contains no music; and the \\"Antiphonarium\\" performs for it a service similar to that of the \\"Liber Gradualis\\" for the Missal. Just as the \\"Liber Gradualis\\" and the \\"Antiphonarium\\" are, for the sake of convenience, separated from the Missal and Breviary respectively, so, for the same reason, still further subdivisions have been made of each. The \\"Antiphonarium\\" has been issued in a compendious form \\"for the large number of churches in which the Canonical Hours of the Divine Office are sung only on Sundays and Festivals\\". This Antiphonarium Romanum compendiose redactum ex editionibus typicis etc., includes, however, the chants for the Masses of Christmas, the triduum of Holy Week, and other desired Offices, and is issued in a single volume. Another separate volume is the \\"Vesperal\\", which contains also the Office of Compline; and of the \\"Vesperal\\" a further compendium has been issued, entitled \\"Epitome ex Vesperali Romano\\". Associated somewhat in scope with the \\"Antiphonarium\\" is the \\"Directorium Chorii\\", which has been described as furnishing the ground plan for the antiphonary, inasmuch as it gives or indicates all the music of the chants (except the responsories after the Lessons), the tones of the psalms, the brief responsories, the \\"Venite Exultemus\\", the \\"Te Deum\\", Litanies etc. The text of all the psalms, the full melody of the hymns, and the new feasts were added to the \\"official edition\\" of the \\"Directorium\\" in 1888. The word antiphonary does not therefore clearly describe the contents of the volume or volumes thus entitled, in which are found many chants other than the antiphon per se, such as hymns, responsories, versicles, and responses, psalms, the \\"Te Deum,\\" the \\"Venite Adoremus,\\" and so forth. The expression \\"antiphonal chant\\" would, however, comprise all these different kinds of texts and chants, since they are so constructed as to be sung alternately by the two divisions of the liturgical choir; and in this sense the word Antiphonary would be sufficiently inclusive in its implication. On the other hand, the corresponding volume for the chants of the Mass, namely the \\"Graduale\\", or \\"Liber Gradualis\\", includes many other kinds of liturgical texts and chants in addition to the graduals, such as introits, tracts, sequences, offertories, communions, as well as the fixed texts of the \\"Ordinarium Missæ\\", or \\"Kyriale\\". It may be said, then, that these two books receive the names \\"Antiphonarium\\" and \\"Graduale\\" from the technical name of the most important chants included in them. Fundamentally all the chants, whether of the Mass or of the Divine Office, are sung antiphonally, and might, with etymological propriety, be comprised in the one general musical title of \\"Antiphonary.\\" History The 5th-century abecedarius A solis ortus cardine by Coelius Sedulius, in a late 15th-century antiphonary from the former Kloster St. Katharina in St. Gallen Folio 22r of the English Ranworth Antiphoner contains a portion of the Mass of the Nativity. The historiated initial depicts a Nativity scene. The Poissy Antiphonal, folio 30 (Middle Ages). =Early history= The plainsong melodies found in the Roman antiphonary and the \\"Graduale\\" have received the general title of \\"Gregorian Chant\\", in honour of pope Gregory the Great (r. 590–604), to whom a tradition, supported by internal and external evidence, ascribes the work of revising and collecting into the various texts and chants of the liturgy. Doubtless the ancient missal contained only those texts which were appointed for the celebrant, and did not include the texts which were to be chanted by the cantor and choir; and the \\"Antiphonarium Missæ\\" supplied the omitted texts for the choir as well as the chants in which the texts were to be sung. The importance of the Gregorian Antiphonary is found in the enduring stamp it impressed on the Roman liturgy. Earlier popes had given, a medieval writer assures us, attention to the chants; and he specifies St. Damasus (d. 384), St. Leo (d. 461), St. Gelasius (d. 496), St. Symmachus (d. 514), St. John I (d. 526) and Boniface II (d. 532). It is true, also, that the chants used at Milan were styled, in honour of St. Ambrose (called the \\"Father of Church Song\\"), the Ambrosian Chant. But it is not known whether any collection of the chants had been made before that of St. Gregory, concerning which his ninth-century biographer, John the Deacon, wrote: Antiphonarium centonem … compilavit. The authentic antiphonary mentioned by the biographer has not as yet been found. What was its character? What is meant by cento (\\"patchwork\\")? In the century in which John the Deacon wrote his life of the Saint, a cento meant the literary feat of constructing a coherent poem out of scattered excerpts from an ancient author, in such wise, for example, as to make the verses of Virgil sing the mystery of the Epiphany. The work, then, of St. Gregory was a musical cento, a compilation (centonem ... compilavit) of pre-existing material into a coherent and well-ordered whole. This does not necessarily imply that the musical centonization of the melodies was the special and original work of the Saint, as the practice of constructing new melodies from separate portions of older ones had already been in vogue two or three centuries earlier than his day. But is it clear that the cento was one of melodies as well as of texts? In answer it might indeed by said that in the earliest ages of the Church the chants must have been so very simple in form that they could easily be committed to memory; and that most of the subsequently developed antiphonal melodies could be reduced to a much smaller number of types, or typical melodies, and could thus also be memorized. And yet many say that it is scarcely credible that the developed melodies of St. Gregory's time had never possessed a musical notation, had never been committed to writing. What made his antiphonary so very useful to chanters (as John the Deacon esteemed it) was probably his careful presentation of a revised text with a revised melody, written either in the characters used by the ancient authors (as set down in Boethius) or in neumatic notation. We know that St. Augustine, sent to England by St. Gregory, carried with him a copy of the precious antiphonary, and founded at Canterbury a flourishing school of singing. That this antiphonary contained music we know from the decree of the Second Council of Cloveshoo (747) directing that the celebration of the feasts, in respect to baptism, Masses and music (in cantilenæ modo), should follow the method of the book \\"which we received from the Roman Church\\". That this book was the Gregorian antiphonary is clear from the testimony of Egbert, Bishop of York (732-766), who in his De Institutione Catholica speaks of the \\"Antiphonarium\\" and \\"Missale\\" which the \\"blessed Gregory … sent to us by our teacher, blessed Augustine\\". =Middle Ages= It is impossible to trace here the progress of the Gregorian antiphonary throughout Europe, which resulted finally in the fact that the liturgy of Western Europe, with a very few exceptions, finds itself based fundamentally on the work of St. Gregory, whose labour comprised not merely the sacramentary, and the \\"Antiphonarium Missæ\\", but extended also to the Divine Office. Briefly, the next highly important step in the history of the antiphonary was its introduction into some dioceses of France where the liturgy had been Gallican, with ceremonies related to those of Milan and with chants developed by newer melodies. From the year 754 may be dated the change in favour of the Roman liturgy. St. Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz, on his return from an embassy to Rome, introduced the Roman liturgy into his diocese and founded the Chant School of Metz. Subsequently, under Charlemagne, French monks went to Rome to study the Gregorian tradition there, and some Roman teachers visited France. The interesting story of Ekkehard, concerning two monks, Petrus and Romanus, sent from Rome to teach chant,Lori Kruckenberg, \\"Ekkehard's Use of Musical Detail in the Casus sancti Galli\\", in J.A. Peraino (ed.), Medieval Music in Practice: Studies in Honor of David G. Hughes (1995), 371-394. is not to be taken as historical. But a certain Petrus, according to Notker, was sent to Rome by Charlemagne and at the Abbey of St. Gall trained the monks in the Roman style. Besides Metz and St. Gall, other important schools of chant were founded at Rouen and Soissons. In the course of time new melodies were added, at first characterized by the simplicity of the older tradition, but gradually becoming more free in extended intervals. With respect to German manuscripts, the earliest are found in a style of neumatic notation different from that of St. Gall, while the St. Gall manuscripts are derived not directly from the Italian but from the Irish-Anglo-Saxon. It is probable that before the 10th and 11th centuries (at which period the St. Gall notation began to triumph in the German churches) the Irish and English missionaries brought with them the notation of the English antiphonary. It would take too much space to record here the multiplication of antiphonaries and their gradual deterioration, both in text and in chant, from the Roman standard. The school of Metz began the process early. Commissioned by Louis the Pious to compile a \\"Graduale\\" and antiphonary, the priest Amalarius of Metz found a copy of the Roman antiphonary in the monastery of Corbie, and placed in his own compilation an M when he followed the Metz antiphonary, R when he followed the Roman, and an I C (asking Indulgence and Charity) when he followed his own ideas. His changes in the \\"Graduale\\" were few; in the antiphonary, many. Part of the revision which, together with Elisagarus, he made in the responsories as against the Roman method, were finally adopted in the Roman antiphonary. In the 12th century, the commission established by St. Bernard to revise the antiphonaries of Citeaux criticized with undue severity the work of Amalarius and Elisagarus and withal produced a faulty antiphonary for the Cistercian Order. The multiplication of antiphonaries, the differences in style of notation, the variations in melody and occasionally in text, need not be further described here. In France especially, the multiplication of liturgies subsequently became so great, that when Dom Guéranger, in the middle of the 19th century, started introducing the Roman liturgy into that country, sixty out of eighty dioceses had their own local breviaries. That the word antiphonarium is, or was, quite elastic in its application, is shown by the remark of Amalarius in his Liber de ordine Antiphonarii, written in the first half of the 9th century. The work which in Metz was called \\"Antiphonarius\\" was divided into three in Rome: \\"What we call 'Graduale' they style 'Cantatorius'; and this, in accordance with their ancient custom, is still bound in a single volume in some of their churches. The remainder they divide into two parts: the one containing the responsories is called 'Responsoriale'; while the other, containing antiphons, is called 'Antiphonarius'. I have followed our custom, and have placed together (mixtim) the responsories and the antiphons according to the order of the seasons in which our feasts are celebrated\\" (P. L., CV, 1245). The word \\"cantatory\\" explains itself as a volume containing chants; it was also called \\"Graduale\\", because the chanter stood on a step (gradus) of the ambo or pulpit, while singing the response after the Epistle. Other ancient names for the antiphonary seem to have been Liber Officialis (Office Book) and \\"Capitulare\\" (a term sometimes used for the book containing the Epistles and Gospels). =Modern history= Changes in the antiphonary were made in the Counter-Reformation, resulting from the reform of the Roman Breviary ordered by the Council of Trent and carried out under Pius V. The term antiphonarium, printed as a title to many volumes of the early modern period, is made to cover a very varied selection from the complete antiphonary. Sometimes it means practically a \\"Vesperale\\" (sometimes with Terce added; sometimes with various processional chants and blessings taken from the \\"Processionale\\" and \\"Rituale\\"). These volumes meet the local usages in certain dioceses with respect to Church services, and offer a practical manual for the worshipper, excluding portions of the Divine Office not sung in choir in some places and including those portions which are sung. (See also names of Antiphonaries, as Armagh, Antiphonary of Bangor etc.) In the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement to restore medieval Gregorian music. Louis Lambillotte reproduced various antiphonaries and graduals, as did the \\"Plain Song and Medieval Music Society\\" and especially by André Mocquereau (1849–1930), whose Paléographie Musicale (established 1889) published phototypic reproductions of antiphonaries of Einsiedeln, of St. Gall, of Hartker, of Montpellier, of the twelfth-century monastic antiphonary found in the library of the Chapter of Lucca, which in course of publication illustrated the Guidonian notation that everywhere replaced, save in the school of St. Gall, the ambiguous method of writing the neums in campo aperto, Mocquereau was succeeded as editor of Paléographie Musicale by his leading disciple, Joseph Gajard (1885-1972) in 1930. This appeal to early tradition has resulted in Pius X taking away its official sanction from the Ratisbon edition. The Ratisbon \\"Graduale\\", founded on the Medicean (which gave the chants as abbreviated and changed by Anerio and Suriano), and the \\"Antiphonarium\\" (which was based on the Antiphonale of Venice, 1585, with the responsories of Matins based on the Antwerp edition of 1611), would be replaced by the chants as found in the older codices. The so-called \\"Ratisbon edition\\" of the Roman antiphonary, entitled Antiphonarium et Psalterium juxta ordinem Breviarii Romani cum cantu sub auspicis Pii IX et Leonis XIII Pontif. Maxim. reformato. Curâ et auctoritate S. Rituum Congregationis digestum Romæ, (edited by Friedrich Pustet, 1879)Antiphonary and Psaltery according to the order of the Roman Breviary, with the chant as reformed under the auspices of Pope Pius IX and Leo XIII. Arranged at Rome under the supervision of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. was most widely used in the late nineteenth century, and commended for use in all the churches of the Catholic world by Pius IX and Leo XIII. The first of these volumes to be issued, entitled: Tomus II. continens Horus Diurnus Breviarii Romani (Vesperale), contained the antiphons, psalms, hymns and versicles of the Canonical Hours styled Horæ Diurnæ, i. e. Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline. It comprised in one volume what in some editions had been distributed in several, such as the \\"Antiphonarium\\" (in a very restricted sense), the \\"Psalterium\\", the \\"Hymnarium\\", the \\"Responsoriale\\". The Office of Matins was divided into the other two volumes, one of which contained the invitatories, antiphons, hymns, etc., of Matins for the Proprium de Tempore (Proper of the Season), and the other, for the Commune Sanctorum (Common Office of the Saints) and the Proprium Sanctorum (Proper Office of the Saints). A brief study of the divisions and arrangement of the Marquess of Bute's translation into English of the Roman Breviary will make clear from the above description the general character of a complete Roman antiphonary. It is suggested by some that this Ratisbon edition has lost its authentic and official character by virtue of the Motu proprio Tra le sollecitudini (22 November 1903), and the Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (8 January 1904). Pope Pius X rejected the Ratisbon edition and ordered the creation of a new Vatican edition, in which both the texts and the melodies were to be revised in order to bring them into conformity with the results of recent palaeographic studies in Gregorian chant. The Ratisbon editions were replaced with the Vatican edition of 1912 The Antiphonale monasticum (1934) was produced by the Benedictines of Solesmes. In 1971 the Office was substantially revised and renamed the Liturgy of the Hours (Liturgia Horarum) and new books appeared: the Psalterium monasticum (1981) and the Liber hymnarius (1982).

He was an editorial staff member and photographer for several magazines during the 1970s, 80s and 90s, notably Pro Wrestling Illustrated. These magazines often reported wrestling in kayfabe, focusing on the storylines and angles rather than reporting \\"backstage\\" goings on. Apter was so closely associated with these magazines that they were often known as \\"Apter Mags.\\" The influence of these publications in the days before cable television and the internet was such that Apter has been credited with launching the careers of many young wrestlers whom he featured on magazine covers. 1970s =Working for Stanley Weston= Bill Apter made his debut as a writer in January 1970, writing for his first employer in publishing Stanley Weston (who he also credits as his mentor). He became a reporter, writer and photographer for several wrestling and boxing magazines published by Weston, including The Wrestler and Inside Wrestling. He was eventually promoted to the senior editor spot at Weston's wrestling publications.  1980s–1990s  =Pro Wrestling Illustrated= The publications Apter worked for were directed at the common fan and usually operated under the premise that professional wrestling was not scripted or predetermined. The editors of the magazines had the mentality that they were covering wrestling the way Sports Illustrated covers other sports. In 1991, Apter began to regularly help compile the PWI 500, a detailed ranking of the top 500 wrestlers in the world. Pro Wrestling Illustrated has published the list every year since its inception. Apter worked for PWI until 1999, when he accepted the editorship of WOW Magazine. The publication folded in 2001. =Television and video= Apter hosted a television segment called the PWI Scouting Report on Jim Crockett's NWA Best of World Championship Wrestling, a weekly WTBS show. He hosted several dozen other TV segments, including for the nationally syndicated Pro Wrestling This Week TV news magazine. In 1985, Apter was also the co-host (alongside Gordon Solie) of pro wrestling's first commercial home video, Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents Lords of the Ring: Superstars & Superbouts. =Friendship with Andy Kaufman= Apter was friends with actor and comedian Andy Kaufman. Kaufman had been a fan of professional wrestling since childhood and visited Apter one evening at his New York apartment to discuss his aspirations of entering the wrestling ring. Kaufman told Apter of his love for the profession and his admiration for Buddy Rogers, who he wanted to emulate. Apter was taken by Kaufman's passion for wrestling and put him in touch with Jerry Lawler, who Apter thought could help set up an in-ring angle. Apter called Lawler at 1am and told him Kaufman's story. Lawler was initially skeptical, finding it hard to believe that a celebrity like Andy Kaufman was sitting in Apter's apartment at 1am, but he eventually spoke to Kaufman on the phone to confirm this and put together their now famous angle.

Its name is derived from the Russian words for \\"forehead\\" (lob) and \\"place\\" (Mesto). In old Russian lob meant a steep river bank. The platform, believed to have been constructed in brick in the 1530s, was first mentioned in 1547, when Ivan the Terrible addressed the Muscovites from there. Subsequently, it was primarily used for announcing the tsar's and for religious ceremonies. Despite a common misconception, the circular platform itself was never a place for executions. Sometimes scaffolds were placed by it, but usually public executions were carried out at Vasilevsky Spusk behind St. Basil's Cathedral. In the Russian Empire, during Holy Week, the Palm Sunday procession called \\"donkey walk\\" would end at the Lobnoye Mesto where a depiction of Calvary had been erected. The Tsar himself, on foot to show humility, would lead the Patriarch of Moscow, who was seated on a donkey, in a procession from the city gates to Red Square. The nearby Monument to Minin and Pozharsky commemorates the events of 1612, when Prince Pozharsky ascended the Lobnoye Mesto to pronounce Moscow free from Polish occupation. In 1786, the architect Matvei Kazakov had the Lobnoye Mesto rebuilt in white stone while keeping its original location and proportions.

She was a Group One/Grade I (G1) winner at two, three and four-years-old, for a total of 10 G1 wins. She was inducted into the American Racing Hall of Fame in 1999. Miesque was equally successful as a broodmare, producing five stakes winners including French Classic winners Kingmambo and East of the Moon. Background Miesque was bred in Lexington, Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings, the breeding operation of shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos. She was sired by Nureyev, a stakes-winner for Niarchos who became a champion sire in France before being exported to the United States. Nureyev was a son of breed-shaping sire Northern Dancer. Her dam was Pasadoble, a stakes-winning mare by Prove Out.

She was stabled in France and trained by François Boutin. The barn staff nicknamed her \\"La Concierge\\" because of her interest in what was happening around her. Racing record Miesque won three of her four races as a two-year-old, including the French Group One (G1) Prix de la Salamandre over and the Prix Marcel Boussac over . Her sole loss was a third-place finish in the Prix Morny. She was named the French Champion two- year-old filly of 1986.

Despite the fierce competition, the filly won the race by four lengths, making her the first ever back-to-back winner in Breeders Cup history. Miesque's win came over a sodden turf course, described by Warning's jockey Pat Eddery as \\"the worse turf I've ever ridden on.\\" Miesque's connection never considered scratching her despite the filly's preference for firmer footing. \\"When you win the Breeders' Cup, then you know why you come\\", said Maria Niarchos. \\"You come to win!\\" The performance earned her a second straight Eclipse Award for Outstanding Female Turf Horse for 1988 and she was again voted France's Champion Miler of the year plus was named that country's Champion Older Mare.

Uilleam was responsible for the construction of Kildrummy Castle, the greatest castle to have been built in 13th century northern Scotland. It is one of the few examples where a native Scottish magnate built a large-scale fortification, something normally practiced by the incoming French. Uilleam, more than any of his predecessors, participated in Scottish and even British-wide politics, becoming a leading figure in the royal regime of Alexander II, and the minority of Alexander III. By 1244, Uilleam had married into the Comyn house, the fastest rising French family in the Scottish kingdom. He married Elisabeth Comyn, the daughter of William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan. The Comyn-Mar alliance helped fight off the ambitions of the Durwards, who were then in prime favor with the king. Alan Durward used his descent from a daughter of Gille Críst to contest Uilleam's right to the Mormaerdom, but Uilleam successfully held off these claims. Uilleam and the Comyn Earl of Menteith then launched accusations of treason towards Alan while at the court of Henry III of England at York. Uilleam engaged in supplementing his power on a nationwide basis. He held the post of Sheriff of Dumbarton between 1264 and 1266, a post which opened up connections in the western Highlands. Uilleam was able to marry his younger son Donnchadh to Cairistíona Nic Ruaidhrí, daughter of the Hebridean chief Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí, a man who had been one of the principal supporters of Norwegian cause against the Scottish Crown in the 1260s. When his wife Isabel (also called Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Comyn and Marjory Colham) died in 1267, Uilleam married Muriel, the daughter of Maol Íosa II, Mormaer of Strathearn. Uilleam died in 1276, and was succeeded by his son Domhnall. Bibliography * Oram, Richard D., \\"The Earls and Earldom of Mar, c1150-1300,\\" Steve Boardman and Alasdair Ross (eds.)

Capable of carrying three two-seat Aichi M6A1 \\"Seiran\\" (Mountain Haze) float torpedo bombers, the Sentoku-class submarines were built to launch a surprise air strike against the Panama Canal. Service history When I-401 was completed and commissioned on 8 January 1945 in the Kure Naval District, the Second World War was almost over. This left the fate of I-401 uncertain. After several attempts to launch, I-401 set course for its first target, but was stopped by Emperor Hirohito's broadcast, calling for an end to all hostilities on 15 August 1945. On 26 August 1945, I-401 hoisted a black flag of surrender. Its unmanned planes were catapulted into the sea, all 20 Type 95 torpedoes were destroyed, and all codes, logs, charts and secret documents were also destroyed. Three days later, on 29 August 1945, I-401 was picked up on 's radar. I-401 surrendered to the US ship. Lieutenant Commander Nobukiyo Nambu delivered two katana, as a symbol of surrender, to Lieutenant John Edward Balson, Segundos Prize Crew officer. I-401 was finally sunk, when used as a target ship, off Pearl Harbor on 31 May 1946. Rediscovery On 17 March 2005, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's (HURL) deep-diving submersibles Pisces IV & Pisces V located I-401 off the coast of Kalaeloa. I-401 lies about off the coast of Barbers Point. The bow is broken off just forward of the aircraft hangar. The two pieces are not far apart and are connected by a debris field. The main hull is sitting upright on the sea floor, and the designation \\"I-401\\" is clearly seen on the sides of the conning tower. Her 25-mm anti-aircraft guns seem in almost perfect condition.

The gun, in both full-length and carbine versions, was widely used in subsequent battles against the American Indians. The model 1873 was the fifth variation of the Allin trapdoor design, and was named for its hinged breechblock, which opened like a trapdoor. The infantry rifle model featured a 32-inch (829 mm) barrel, while the cavalry carbine used a barrel. It was superseded by an improved model, the Springfield model 1884, also in .45-70 caliber. Selection process model 1888, breech open In 1872–1873 a military board, headed by Brigadier-General Alfred H. Terry, conducted an examination and trial of 99 rifles from several domestic and foreign manufacturers including those from Springfield, Sharps, Peabody, Whitney, Spencer, Remington, and Winchester pursuant to the selection of a breech-loading system for rifles and carbines for the U.S. Military. The trials included tests for accuracy, dependability, rate-of-fire, and ability to withstand adverse conditions. Both single shot and magazine equipped systems were considered but, at the time, the single shot was deemed to be more reliable. Firing tests were held at the Springfield Armory and Governor's Island where the average rate of fire for the Springfield was 8 rounds per minute for new recruits and 15 rounds per minute for experienced soldiers. The board recommended \\"No. 99 Springfield\\" which became the model 1873. Ballistics The rifle cartridge was designated as \\".45-70-405\\", indicating a .45 caliber (11.63 mm), bullet propelled by of black powder. It had a muzzle velocity of , making it a powerful and effective load for the skirmish tactics of the era. A reduced- power load of of powder (Carbine Load) was manufactured for use in the carbine to lighten recoil for mounted cavalry soldiers. This cartridge had a correspondingly reduced muzzle velocity of and a somewhat reduced effective range. Use in combat The rifle was originally issued with a copper cartridge case and used in the American West during the second half of the 19th century, but the soldiers soon discovered that the copper expanded excessively in the breech upon firing. Another issue was the copper held in leather carriers created a green film that would effectively weld the case into the breech of the carbine when fired. This sometimes jammed the rifle by preventing extraction of the fired cartridge case. A jam required manual extraction with a knife blade or similar tool, and could render the carbine version of the weapon, which had no ramrod to remove stuck cases, useless in combat except as a club. After the annihilation of Lieutenant-Colonel George Armstrong Custer's battalion (armed with the carbine and carbine load ammunition) at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876, investigations first suggested that jamming of their carbines may have played a factor, although archaeological excavations in 1983 discovered evidence that only 3.4 percent of the cases recovered showed any indication of being pried from jammed weapons.Fox, Richard A., Archaeology, History and Custer's Last Battle, 1993, University of Oklahoma Press, , pp. 241–242 This did not account for cases removed by a ramrod or other \\"stick\\" nor for jammed rifles cleared away from the immediate battle area and outside the very limited archaeological survey area. Every Custer battalion weapon became Indian property. Captain Thomas French, M Company Commander was kept busy on the Reno defensive position line using the cleaning rod from his infantry rifle to clear the jammed carbines passed to him from the cavalryman on the line. The cartridge was subsequently redesigned with a brass case, since that material did not expand as much as copper. This was shown to be a major improvement, and brass became the primary material used in United States military cartridges from then to the present. After the Little Big Horn disaster, troops were required to perform target practice twice a week. The black powder Model 1873 continued to be the main service rifle of the U.S. military until it was gradually replaced by the Springfield model 1892 bolt-action rifle, essentially a copy of the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen action. Replacement began in 1892, and despite its obsolescence, the Model 1873 was still used by secondary units during the Spanish–American War in Cuba and the Philippines, where it was at a major disadvantage against Spanish forces armed with the 7 mm Spanish M93 Mauser bolt action rifle. There are reports of the surplus trapdoor Springfields being issued to civilians living in coastal areas during World War I to provide for an armed militia in the event of a German invasion.

The club is known to have sold the skillful attacker Joseph Mermans to R.S.C. Anderlecht during World War II for a record fee of 125,000 Belgian francs. History Tubantia Football & Athletic Club was founded in 1915 and first accessed to the second division in 1928 finishing 8th. The next year it finished 2nd and thus played the first division in 1930–31 finishing 11th on 14 (this year R.S.C. Anderlecht finished last). However Tubantia finished 13th one season later and was relegated with F.C. Turnhout. The club then enjoyed a spell in the second division. In 1940 Tubantia F.A.C. changed its name to K. Tubantia F.C. In 1954 it was relegated to the third division and it would never come back at this level, as of 2006. The club however merged with K.R.C. Borgerhout in 1960 to become K.

It is a large gated quadrangle, closed to public traffic, chiefly a green upon which the pupils have the long-use acquired exclusive rights to sit, read and to play games such as football (they have some claim to have invented the modern game).

History  The group was formed by Martin Schreier, Norbert Jäger and Bernd Fiedler in 1964 in Meißen, East Germany as \\"Stern-Combo Meißen\\". At the time the group toured around playing covers of Beatles, Rolling Stones and Kinks songs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9Bb_UgPa4E&t;=632s In the early 70's, upon the arrival of Thomas Kurzhals (keyboardist) and Reinard Fissler (vocals), the classic lineup had formed and took off musically, thus becoming one of the up and coming rock groups in East Germany. In 1975, the group appeared in a scene of a movie called Hostess, performing alongside singer Nina Hagen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO0GdMqh0EY Then upon the arrival of keyboardist Lothar Kramer that same year, the group released their self- titled first album in 1977 through AMIGA, the label through which they would release all of their studio albums from that period up to the late eighties. Around that time they were evolving as an art rock group, releasing two concept albums: One in 1978: Weißes Gold (White Gold) and the other one in 1980: Reise zum Mittelpunkt des Menschen (Journey to the Center of Mankind), the later which was released in the same year the group decided to shorten their name to \\"Stern Meißen\\". Since the release of that album, the group then decided to go in a more pop direction, particularly with the arrival of famous East German singer IC Falkenberg who replaced Fissler in 1983. By then the only member that was left from the 70's lineup (plus the only founding member left in the band) was Schreier. The group then reached new popularity throughout East Germany due to their almost dramatic shift in musical direction, mainly due to Falkenberg's subsequent solo carrier during his tenure with the group. After releasing two more albums, the group then split in 1989. Afterwards the 1986-1989 lineup reunited for a one-off performance in 1992 in which former vocalist Fissler took part in. Then in 1996, the 1979 lineup (excluding Kramer) reunited, adding \\"Combo\\" back into their name, and gave performances up until the early 2000s. By then Fissler had been diagnosed with ALS and thus after releasing a solo album, had to leave the group in early 2005 and stop performing altogether. Falkenberg then briefly rejoined the group for guest performances from 2004 up to early 2008, and then in mid-2008, Schreier reformed the group with only half of the remaining members from the early to mid 2000s lineup. Kurzals rejoined the group, as well as former drummer Frank Schirmer (who was in the 1986-1989 lineup). Singer Larry B. joined the group and in 2011, the group released their first album in 24 years: Lebensuhr (Life hour), with Fissler making a guest appearance in a song he wrote, recorded and produced himself.https://www.discogs.com/Stern-Combo- Meissen-Lebensuhr/release/6072130 This was to be Fissler's final contribution to the group, as well as his final recording as he passed away from complications from ALS in 2016. Before the album's recording, founding member Norbert Jäger left the group. He passed away in 2017. In mid-2012, Larry K left the group and late 1980s bassist Axel Schäfer (who was in the 1986-1989 lineup) rejoined. Larry K was replaced by singer and keyboardist Manuel Schmid. Keyboardist Sebastian Düwelt joined the group around the same time. Thomas Kurzhals remained with the group up until his death in January 2014. In 2018, the new lineup released the single \\"Nimm die Welt in die Hand\\" (Take the world in your hands). In 2019, the group had a series of performances with special guests: Former vocalist Viktoria Fischer (who was only in the group briefly in 1970 and had a subsequent successful solo carrier), and former keyboardist Andreas Bicking (who was in the group from 1984-1989). Upon the release of their latest album \\"Freiheit ist\\" (Freedom is), the group changed their name back to \\"Stern Meißen\\".

The municipality consists of the town of Weeze and the village of Wemb and has approximately 10,500 inhabitants. It is situated in the district of Kleve, embedded in the northwestern part of the Lower Rhine Region, and lies between Goch to the north and Kevelaer to the south. The Netherlands lie directly to the west. History Individual artefacts from the earliest settlement of the area date back to the early/middle Stone Age. In the following periods a burial site with 1,000 tumuli in the area of Kalbeck, settlement remains on the Hees, remnants of the Roman road between Cologne and Nijmegen in the Netherlands and a significant discovery of Roman silver coins have all been found on municipal soil. Franconian burial sites from around the 8th century have also been unearthed in the close vicinity of the town centre. Examples of Weeze's history are the restored Catholic church of St Cyriakus, excavations from the Stone and Bronze Ages, Wissen Castle complete with moat, Kalbeck Castle and the ruins of Hertefeld Castle. An area in and around today's Weeze was first-mentioned in a document from King Lothar II in 855 when the King presented Count Ansfried with a piece of estate to the east of the River Niers, known as Villa Geizefurt and situated mainly in the farmstead area of Kalbeck. The area was populated before the name Weeze was officially mentioned for the first time in a document in 1226 when the Earl to Alpen, Henry III, presented the Zisterzienserkloster Kamp with an estate in the farmstead of Vornick. The municipal development suffered a major setback during the Second World War when eighty percent of the town was destroyed. Through commitment, hard work and craft skills the citizens of Weeze managed to rebuild the town. Destroyed houses and buildings were rebuilt in the fifties and sixties. The town development was continuously pursued and culminated in the redevelopment of the town centre. Today, the town centre is the forum for activities such as the Kirmes (carnival fair), Christmas markets, street parties and more. Weeze became well known through its energetic shoe-makers, whose shoes were distributed to Krefeld and Wuppertal, later through carpentry and woodworking, and through the Royal Air Force airbase at Laarbruch, which was located in the heart of the Municipality between 1954 and 1999. Today it is the newly opened regional airport “Airport Weeze”, located on the former RAF airbase. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms of Weeze The Municipality of Weeze was granted the right to carry a coat of arms by the Prussian Ministry of State on April 28, 1928. The official blazon of the coat of arms of Weeze is: The saint depicted in the left half of the field is the patron saint of the town, St. Cyriacus, with a book and palm. The top right half of the field depicts a black dragon's head on a golden background (in reference to a legend of Cyriacus enchaining a dragon), and the bottom right half with a white background bears a green twig with five red roses (Geldrian roses/medlar blooms, depicting the affiliation to the former duchy of Geldern) and five leaves. The coat of arms can be seen on the Weeze juror's (court's) crest from 1460. Economy The departure of almost 40% of the local population with the withdrawal of British personnel and the closure of nearby RAF Laarbruch in 1999 left Weeze's politicians and inhabitants with a major challenge. Industrial estates have been redesigned and extended so that companies have been able to expand and new companies have, as a result, chosen Weeze as a home base. The population has grown by almost 10% since the departure of RAF personnel and their families. Local politicians are targeting a future population of 12,000. With the positive economic perspective provided by Weeze Airport, which already employs in the region of 350 locals, the municipality of Weeze is to undergo many changes in its infrastructure. Roads to and from the airport will have to be extended and improved to meet future demand. Schools and kindergartens will also have to grow in capacity for the targeted increase in population. The municipality can be reached by road and rail: via Autobahn A 57, via the B 9 road or by rail on the Cologne-Kleve link. Due to this fact and the easy accessibility from the Rhine-Ruhr region, from Düsseldorf and Krefeld, as well as from the Netherlands, Weeze is an attractive site for commercial businesses. With recent state approval for the development of the former RAF Laarbruch airbase into a regional civilian airport with a logistical and industrial base, a projected 2,000 jobs were to be created by the year 2010. = Airport = The airport in the Municipality of Weeze was formerly home to a Royal Air Force base at RAF Laarbruch between 1954 and 1999, situated close to the village of Weeze-Wemb. Closure of the airbase in 1999 had a considerable effect on the local economy, with the loss of 400 jobs and the departure of 5,000 base personnel and dependants. The airbase was rejuvenated by a new role as a civilian regional airport Weeze Airport (also known as Niederrhein) which saw commercial operations commence in May 2003. Situated near the city of Cleves, the new airport has been intended to enable low-cost airlines to operate efficiently. Approximately 11 million travellers, mostly Dutch and German, use the airport annually. The two-storey terminal building measures approximately and was developed from a steel building which dated back to 1933. The large- scale glass front, granite floor and a modern interior provide for an up-to- date appearance. Parking spaces for 1,000 vehicles were built in front of the terminal. On 3 January 2006, an administrative court suspended the airport's operating licence in response to complaints over noise. Flight operations however continue while the issue is debated in the courts.  Politics and government  The municipal council of Weeze has 28 members. Since the municipal elections in 2014, the membership of the council has been: : CDU (58.7%, 16 seats); : SPD (25.1%, 7 seats) : Alliance '90 / The Greens (10.4%, 3 seats), and; : FDP (5.8%, 2 seats). Culture and tourism The surrounding countryside draws tourists and nature lovers. Its setting on the River Niers in the northern part of the Lower Rhine Region combined with the close proximity to the Netherlands make Weeze an easily accessible town. On its way to the Meuse the Niers snakes past castles and old farmhouses. Natural and historical sights of interest are dotted throughout the municipality, making the countryside setting attractive and interesting. =Wissen Castle= Schloss Wissen is a moated castle located to south of Weeze on the B 9 trunk road. The roots of this complex date back to the 14th century. After a number of different building phases, today's castle is primarily neo Gothic in design. The von Loe family extensively restored the castle between 1969 and 1973. A highlight of the castle is its neo Gothic chapel which was built in 1876 and designed by the Cologne architect Vincenz Statz. An authentic servants’ settlement, the Boye, also belongs to the castle complex, where extensive buildings stemming from the past two centuries are still visible. =Kalbeck Castle= On the other side of Weeze, to the north, is the complex of Kalbeck, hardly visible from the road and situated in a large wood. This castle also has a long history, being first mentioned as a moated castle in 1326. Destroyed by fire on a number of occasions, Baron Friedrich von Vittinghoff-Schell rebuilt it in 1909 modelled on Westphalian moated castles of the 18th century. The gardens of the castle provide a backdrop for classical outdoor concerts in the summer. =The ruins of Hertefeld Castle= This historically important manor (14th century) and later Baroque castle lies to the east of Weeze in the middle of an approximately five-hectare park and is still owned by the family of zu Eulenburg und Hertefeld. The castle received extensive war damage in 1945 and of its complex only the neighbouring house from 1706 remained intact. However, the ruins of the castle were bolstered so that the remaining historical walls could host classical and theatrical events. =Tourism= The Municipality offers a wide range of outdoor activities. An almost network of bridle, cycling and rambling paths, partially along the Niers River, as well as recreational activities such as angling, canoeing and kart racing round off an abundance of leisure activities in and around the Municipality. The Herrensitz-Route, a border-crossing cycling route, guides cyclists to these and many other highlights and attractions of the region, such as Kleve, home of Anne of Cleves; Kevelaer, famous for its pilgrimages, Moyland Castle between Kalkar and Bedburg-Hau, or Gennep in the Netherlands where the Meuse and Niers rivers converge. The Weeze animal park with its educational trail and children's zoo is a special attraction for families. The park is located on the edge of the town next to the ruins of Hertefeld Castle. =Twin towns= Weeze is twinned with the town of Watton, Norfolk in England.

Deciding what (if anything) counts as \\"morally obligatory\\" is a principal concern of ethics. Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as moral agents. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form intentions about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of free will has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. Incompatibilists regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas compatibilists think the two can coexist. Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to legal responsibility. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide. Philosophical stance Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over determinism and free will Depending on how a philosopher conceives of free will, they will have different views on moral responsibility. = Metaphysical libertarianism = Metaphysical libertarians think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; for think that if causal determinism were true of human action, people would not have free will. Accordingly, some libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently. Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will. Jean-Paul Sartre suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: \\"we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse\\".Sartre, J.P. (1943)Being and Nothingness, reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. A similar view is that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions \\"reflect on their character\\". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.Vuoso, G. (1987) \\"Background Responsibility and Excuse,\\" Yale Law Journal, 96, pp. 1680–81Cummins, R. \\"Culpability\\" and Mental Disorder\\", p. 244 In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The insanity defense—or its corollary, diminished responsibility (a sort of appeal to the fallacy of the single cause)—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. & Shapiro, D. L. 2003 \\"Evaluation of criminal responsibility\\". In Forensic psychology. vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley. In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).  The argument from luck  The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside a person's control. It may not be appropriate, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible. Thomas Nagel suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of drunk driving might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).Nagel, Thomas. 1976, \\"Moral Luck\\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55. This argument can be traced back to David Hume. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).Hume, D. (1740). A Treatise of Human Nature (1967 edition). Oxford University Press, Oxford. = Hard determinism = Hard determinists (not to be confused with Fatalists) often use liberty in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say \\"So much the worse for free will!\\".Benditt, Theodore (1998) Philosophy Then and Now with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. Clarence Darrow, the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, Leopold and Loeb, by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.Darrow, Clarence, 1924, \\"The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder\\" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989. During his summation, he declared: Paul the Apostle, in his Epistle to the Romans addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: \\"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?\\"St. Paul, \\"Epistle to the Romans\\", 9:21, King James Bible Tennessee:The Gideons International In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God. Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of neuroethics, argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and dualist) intuitions.Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). \\"For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything\\". Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 359, 1775–1785. They argue that cognitive neuroscience research (e.g. neuroscience of free will) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid psychosis, but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the frontal lobe reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). \\"Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review\\". Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 71: 720–726. This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). \\"Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty\\".American Psychologist 58, 1009–1018. and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). \\"The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment\\". Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews, 27: 33–44. In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions. Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them. David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, \\"David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain\\" Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of justice, in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of ethically realistic and consequentialist approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will. Neuroscientist David Eagleman maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the \\"sentencing phase\\" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating pedophilic tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.\\"Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia\\" Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system. = Hard incompatibilism = Derk Pereboom defends a skeptical position about free will he calls hard incompatibilism. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward. While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing. However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6. Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.Pereboom, Derk (2001), Living without Free Will, Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life, Chapter 7. =Compatibilism= Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term free will should only be used to mean something more like liberty. Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text The Bhagavad Gita offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: \\"... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave...\\" When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself. Paramahansa Yogananda also said, \\"Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation.\\" In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the Bhagavad Gitas point about agents and natural forces, writing \\"men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes].\\" Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: \\"Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?\\" Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures. P.F. Strawson is a major example of a contemporary compatibilist. His paper \\"Freedom and Resentment,\\" which adduces reactive attitudes, has been widely cited as an important response to incompatibilist accounts of free will. Other compatibilists, who have been inspired by Strawson's paper, are as follows: Gary Watson, Susan Wolf, R. Jay Wallace, Paul Russell, and David Shoemaker. =Other views= Daniel Dennett asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be \\"a purely metaphysical hankering\\".Dennett, D., (1984) Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting. Bradford Books. Bruce Waller has argued, in Against Moral Responsibility (MIT Press), that moral responsibility \\"belongs with the ghosts and gods and that it cannot survive in a naturalistic environment devoid of miracles\\". We cannot punish another for wrong acts committed, contends Waller, because the causal forces which precede and have brought about the acts may ultimately be reduced to luck, namely, factors over which the individual has no control. One may not be blamed even for one’s character traits, he maintains, since they too are heavily influenced by evolutionary, environmental, and genetic factors (inter alia). Although his view would fall in the same category as the views of philosophers like Dennett who argue against moral responsibility, Waller's view differs in an important manner: He tries to, as he puts it, \\"rescue\\" free will from moral responsibility (See Chapter 3). This move goes against the commonly held assumption that how one feels about free will is ipso facto a claim about moral responsibility. = Epistemic Condition for Moral Responsibility = In philosophical discussions of moral responsibility, two necessary conditions are usually cited: the control (or freedom) condition (which answers the question 'did the individual doing the action in question have free will?') and the epistemic condition, the former of which is explored in the above discussion. The epistemic condition, in contrast to the control condition, focuses on the question 'was the individual aware of, for instance, the moral implications of what she did?' Not all philosophers think this condition to be a distinct condition, separate from the control condition: For instance, Alfred Mele thinks that the epistemic condition is a component of the control condition. Nonetheless, there seems to be philosophical consensus of sorts that it is both distinct and explanatorily relevant. One major concept associated with the condition is \\"awareness.\\" According to those philosophers who affirm this condition, one needs to \\"aware\\" of four things to be morally responsible: the action (which one is doing), its moral significance, consequences, and alternatives. Experimental research Mauro suggests that a sense of personal responsibility does not operate or evolve universally among humankind. He argues that it was absent in the successful civilization of the Iroquois. In recent years, research in experimental philosophy has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist. Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).\\"Is belief in free will a cultural universal?\\" Mind & Language However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give incompatibilist answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give compatibilist answers). The neuroscience of free will investigates various experiments that might shed light on free will. Collective When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents. However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Accessed 8 Sept 2007) For example, when South Africa had an apartheid regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non- European South Africans. Psychopathy's lack of sense of responsibility One of the attributes defined for psychopathy is \\"failure to accept responsibility for own actions\\".  Artificial systems  The emergence of automation, robotics and related technologies prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?' The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'. The questions arguably adjoin with but are distinct from machine ethics, which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems. Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate. = Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible = Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr. posited that intentionality is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality. Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers. Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as finite state machines. They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility. Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans. He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014. An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour. Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system. (A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.) = Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible = Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'. They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the Turing Test. Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription. He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators. First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means. Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means. Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine. (A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.)

Suzzanna's performance was well received by audiences, and in 1960 she was named Best Child Actress Award at the Asian Film Festival; she was also given recognition at the 1960 Indonesian Film Festival.

Together, in 1965, they established the film production company Tri Murni Film, which produced only one film--Segenggam Tanah Perbatasan (1965), starring both Suzzanna and Suprapto--before closing. They collaborated on another film, Suzie, the following year. Their final effort, Tidar Jaya Film, was most successful; it produced four films between 1970 and 1973. The first of these was Tuan Tanah Kedawung (1970), an adaptation of the comic by . In this film, Suzzanna took the role of Ratna, a woman who must protect her husband's land deeds while he is working in Borneo. Tidar Jaya subsequently produced Beranak dalam Kubur (1971), Bumi Makin Panas (1973), and Napsu Gila (1973); all of these featured Suzzanna. Suzzanna's greatest popular success of the 1970s, however, came from another company. In 1970, she was cast in ', a production by Sarinande Films directed by . In this film, Suzzanna portrays a woman who travels to Jakarta in search of her husband, only to fall victim of a human trafficking ring. Controversial for its frank depictions of sexuality and coarse language, the film was banned in Bandung but nonetheless the most popular domestic production of the year. For this film, Suzzanna was crowned as Asia's most popular actress at the 1972 Asia-Pacific Film Festival in Seoul. She later decided that the film's depiction of sexuality was too frank, vowing to not take such roles in the future. Suzzanna separated from Suprapto in 1974, shortly following Napsu Gila; Tidar Jaya ceased operations soon afterwards. Indonesians knew her as The Indonesian Horror Queen,Horror Artist Suzanna Dies , The Jakarta Post, 2008-10-17 not only because of her acting but also because of her mystic lifestyle. Some people said that she looked young in her old age because she ate jasmine flowers. She was married to actor Dicky Suprapto. After their separation (never divorced as their marriage was a Catholic marriage), she lived together with actor Clift Sangra. Her daughter from her marriage with Dicky Suprapto, Kiki Maria, is also an actress. She retired from films in the 1990s but made a comeback in Hantu Ambulance, 2008. However, it would be her final appearance.

The models are similar to those found in Continental India, but are less extensive and important for various reasons, although the caste systems still play an important and at least symbolic role in religion and politics. Sri Lanka is often considered to be a casteless or caste-blind society by Indians. The caste systems of Sri Lanka were historically not tied to the religious establishment but rather a tool to service the ruling elite - a model more reminiscent of feudalism in Europe. At least three major, parallel caste systems exist in Sri Lankan society: Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamil and Indian Tamils'. A universal welfare system which focused on providing education for everyone regardless of background has provided people from lower caste groups similar opportunities to enter jobs previously only frequented by those in upper caste groups, with younger generations mostly rejecting any pressure to conform to caste-related jobs. The Civil War has also broken down caste barriers as they were seen as an obstacle towards ethnolinguistic unity. Overview The caste system of the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils display some similar traits, where both systems having comparable castes with similar occupation and status. The interior arable land is largely dominated by the Govigama caste under the Sinhalese and by the Vellalar under the Sri Lankan Tamils, who are traditionally involved as husbandmen and form approximately half the population of their respective ethnicities. The peasants under them are the Sinhalese Bathgama and Tamil Pallars. The coastal land is dominated by the Karavas under the Sinhalese and the Karaiyar under the Tamils. Both castes share a common origin with background in seafaring, trade and warfare. The artisans were collectively known as Navandanna by the Sinhalese and as Kammalar by the Tamils. They constituted of respective endogamous castes traditionally involved as blacksmith, goldsmith, coppersmith, carpenters and stonemasons. While toddy tapping was largely in the hands of the Sinhalese Durava and Tamil Nalavar, jaggery production was in the hands of the Sinhalese Vahumpura and Tamil Cantars. The traditional drummers of both ethnicities, the Sinhalese Berava and Tamil Paraiyar, have religious importance in Buddhism and Hinduism, respectively. The domestic castes of barbers and dhobies were the respective Sinhalese Ambattaya and Hinnava, and Tamil Ambattar and Vannar. In ancient Ceylon, although marriages between Sinhalese and Tamils (usually among higher castes) were not uncommon, they occurred between comparable castes; Eurasians and South Indian Chetties married into the southern Sinhalese Govigama and Karava. Although caste discrimination is still found in Sri Lanka (particularly in rural areas), caste boundaries are blurring. Political power and wealth have largely replaced caste as the main factor in Sri Lankan social stratification, especially in the Sinhalese and Indian Tamil communities.Caste in Jaffna And India, Review Article on Neville Jayaweera's Jaffna Exorcising the Past and Holding the Vision Dr. Devanesan Nesiah (Sunday Leader 10.10.2014) Ponnambalam Ramanathan, under British Ceylon, opposed extending voting rights to the people and urged reservation of franchise only to men of the Vellalar caste. Sinhalese castes The documented history of the island begins with the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India. Although the origin of Sri Lankan communities is unclear, genetic studies on Sinhalese have shown that most of the Sinhala community are genetically related to North Indians, with traces from South india too.

Ancient Sri Lankan texts, such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya, Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptions, show that a caste system namely existed among the Sinhalese. Evidence of this hierarchy can be seen during the 18th century British-Kandyan period,Kadayimpoth - Boundary Books indicating its continuation even after the Sri Lankan monarchy.MahavanshaSinhala Sanna ha Thudapath, Ananada thissa Kumara, Godage Publication,Second Edition,2006,pp 142,pp 137 Colonialism and foreign intervention in the dynastic conflicts of the island throughout history has also influenced the caste system, some suggesting even a re- arrangement of the occupational castes.Kandy Fights the Portuguese, C.Gaston Perera, Vijithayapa Publications, 2007An Historical Relation Of The Island Ceylon In The East Indies, Robert knox, 1681, pp. 46 & 73 ;Kandyan castes In the Central Highlands, many traditions of the Kingdom of Kandy were preserved from its 1818 collapse beyond independence in 1948 and the Land Reform Act of the 1970s. Although large agricultural landlords belonged to the Govigama caste, many now may not own land. Most Govigama were however ordinary farmers and tenants as absolute land ownership was exclusive to the king until the British colonial period. The most important feature of the Kandyan system was Rajakariya (\\"the king's work\\"), which linked each caste to an occupation and demanded service to the court and religious institutions. ;Southern castes There are still differences between the caste structures of the highlands and those of the low country, although some service groups were common to both in ancient Sri Lanka. The southwestern coast has three other castes (the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava) in addition to the majority of ancient Govigama, which is common throughout the region. Some of these castes' ancestors are believed to have migrated from Southern India, and have become important in the Sinhalese social system. The first-century BC Anuradhpura Abayagiri inscription referring to a Karava navika may be the first reference to a specialized occupation. Sri Lankan Tamil castes The caste system has stronger religious ties than its Sinhalese counterpart, although both systems have comparable castes. There are in the Sri Lankan Tamil caste system, distinctions between Northern and Eastern societies and also the agricultural and coastal societies. The agricultural society have mainly the castes of the Vellalar, Pallar, Nalavar and Koviar, whereas the Vellalar caste is the dominating one, particularly in Northern Sri Lanka. They constitute approximately half of the Sri Lankan Tamil population and are the major land owning and agricultural caste. The Northern and Western coastal societies are dominated by the Karaiyars, who are traditionally a seafaring and warrior caste. The Thimilar and the Paravar are also among the coastal communities involved in fishing. The Mukkuvars, traditional pearl divers, dominate greater parts of Eastern Sri Lanka where they are the major landowners also involved in agriculture. The artisans, known locally as Kammalar or Vishwakarma consists of the Kannar (brass-workers), Kollar (blacksmiths), Tattar (goldsmiths), Tatchar (carpenters), Kartatchar (sculptor). Along with the Kammalar were the Ambattar (barbers), Kadaiyar (lime burners), Koviar (farmers), Kusavar (potters), Maraiyar (conch blowers), Nattuvar (musician), Nalavar (toddy-tappers), Pallar (farmers), Paraiyar (drummers and weavers), Turumbar (dhobies) and Vannar (dhobies) the domestic servants termed as Kudimakkal. The Kudimakkal gave ritual importance in marriage, funeral and other temple ceremonies. Other Sri Lankan Tamil castes of importance are the Cantar (oil-presser), Iyer (priests), Kaikolar (silk-weavers), Madapalli (former royal cooks), Seerpadar (cultivators), Seniyar (cotton-weavers), Siviyar (palanquin bearers) and Maravar (mercenaries). The Sri Lankan Chetties, traditional merchants, along with the Bharatha people, traditional sea-traders, are listed as their own ethnicities in Sri Lankan census. The Coast Veddas, found mainly in Eastern Sri Lanka are considered a Tamil caste among the Sri Lankan Tamils. The village deities of the Sri Lankan Tamils are also shaped by the caste structure. The Sri Lankan Moors don't practice the caste system, however follow a matriclan system which is an extension of Tamil tradition. Indian Tamil castes The Tolkāppiyam Porulatikaram indicating the four-fold division is the earliest Tamil literature to mention caste. Sangam literature however mentions only five kudis associated with the five . Colonialism also had influenced the caste system. Tamils of Indian origin (Hill Country Tamils, who were brought to the island by the British as indentured labour) also follows the Indian caste system form which is called jāti. Their caste structure resembles that of a Tamil Nadu village. Those who are considered to be of higher castes occupy the first row of line rooms. They perform respectable jobs such as factory work and grinding of tea as minor labour work. Even though they belong to the labour category they are influential among conductors, tea makers, kanganies (or supervisors) and other officials. The workers considered low caste live in the dwellings that are away from the centre and these dwellings are called distant or lower lines. This group consists of Pallar, Paraiyars, Sakkiliar, washers and barbers. The yard sweepers and changers of clothes are in the lowest rank.

The lure of the modern: writing modernism in semicolonial China, 1917-1937. University of California Press, 2001. p. 302. Print. was a Chinese writer who is best known for his modernist short stories. He was active in Shanghai in the 1930s where he contributed to journals like Les Contemporains (, 1932-1935), edited by Shi Zhecun. Early life Mu's family came from Cixi, Ningbo, Zhejiang. His father, Mu Jingting (1877–1933) was a banker and gold speculator, who apparently had died of exhaustion and depression after losing money in bad speculations. His mother was Shi Cuifeng (1895-1940). As a college student, Mu studied Chinese literature at Guanghua University in Shanghai. In 1930, he submitted a short story, \\"Our World\\" () to La Nouvelle Littérature (, 1929–1930), a journal that was edited by Shi Zhecun, He Dong, Liu Na'ou (), Dai Wangshu, and Xu Xiacun (). The work was praised by the editors and Mu Shiying became a protégé of Shi Zhecun. Mu became good friends with Liu Na'ou and Dai Wangshu, both of whom were major contributors to the literary movement known as New Sensualism or the New Sensationists (). This was an offshoot of a movement in Japan that borrowed from styles of literary modernism that were being developed in Europe and America. In time, Mu became the leading exemplar of this style. Career Mu wrote over 50 short stories, several novels, screenplays, and numerous essays during his short lifetime. Among his most celebrated short stories are \\"Shanghai Fox-trot,\\" \\"Craven A,\\" and \\"Five in a Nightclub.\\" Mu had a fascination for the city's cabaret culture and was reportedly a fantastic and avid dancer. His short stories conveyed in dream- like fashion the experience of living in the modern city and included many episodes in nightclubs and cabarets. He often focused on the tangled and tortuous relationships between his male narrator and a femme-fatale that he was chasing. One early example of this is \\"The Man Who Was Treated as a Plaything.\\" He also wrote about the sensual aspects of women and their bodies in inventive ways, as in the case of the dance hostess \\"Craven A.\\" Mu pursued a Cantonese dance hostess named Qiu Peipei and eventually married her (see photo). However, they had a falling out. In 1936, Mu Shiying moved to Hong Kong to pursue his estranged wife. He stayed in Hong Kong, but he returned to Shanghai at the invitation of Liu Na'ou who was working with the Japanese. In 1939, Mu became the general manager of a collaborationist newspaper under Wang Jingwei's collaborationist government. Death In 1940, while riding a rickshaw to his office, Mu was gunned down by assassins who were working for Chiang Kai-shek's underground resistance forces. While rumors later suggested that Mu was a double agent, there has been no firm evidence of such a claim. Writing style Mu Shiying is one of the famous writers of the New Perceptionism, he had a dandyish image which was reinforced by his writings -- often set in the dance halls of Shanghai. His most famous short stories are highly modernist pieces that attempt to convey the fragmented and inhuman nature of modern life in the metropolis. They experiment with expressionistic narrative techniques that break with a standard textual flow by juxtaposing disconnected visual images. His most famous short story, \\"Five in a Nightclub\\" (), is a tableau of the miseries faced by modern urban residents, as five individuals converge on a nightclub, each with their own problems. Legacy Poshek Fu of the University of Illinois discusses, and Margaret Blair portrays, the complex political situation faced by Mu and other modernist writers of the 1930s. Andrew David Field has written a lengthy appreciation of Mu's life and times and together with co-translator Hong Yu offers five original translations of Mu's short stories in his book Mu Shiying: China's Lost Modernist, including \\"The Man Who Was Treated as a Plaything,\\" \\"Craven A\\", \\"Night,\\" \\"Black Peony,\\" and \\"Shanghai Fox-trot,\\" along with a translation of \\"Five in a Nightclub\\" by Randolf Trumbull.

In the Navy this rate, together with PC (postal clerk), has been renamed or superseded by the rate logistics specialist (LS). Function Substantiated in 1916, Storekeepers are tasked with maintaining ship or company military supply stores. Their responsibilities generally include purchasing and procurement, shipping and receiving, and issuing of equipment, tools, consumable items or anything else obtained through the Naval Supply System. Chain of Command Storekeepers that fall under the authority of a Naval supply officer are attached permanently or temporarily to a Supply Department, either ashore or afloat. There are exceptions to this practice as is the case of the Independent Storekeeper NEC which trains E-5 and above to operate independent of a Supply Officer, such as, or while deployed with surface or aviation units that operate in remote areas where no Supply Officer is present. Additionally, in Aviation Squadrons, the storekeeper falls under the chain of command of the Aircraft Maintenance Officer and his designate; the Maintenance Material Control Officer. The best example of this is the Storekeeper(s) tasked with operating the Naval Air Station Sigonella Weapons Department in Sicily, Italy. The department, a semi-autonomous entity within NAS Sigonella, is headed by a weapons officer to whom the Storekeepers report. Since there is no Supply Officer within a weapons department either ashore, or afloat, the tasks of material control, inventory control, financial accounting, material custody, issuing, receiving and warehousing and disposition actions all fall within the storekeeper's scope of work, validating, initiating and signing requisitions falls upon the Independent Storekeeper. Rank and Recognition Storekeepers are referred to, as all other Navy rates, by rate and rank combined. If a sailor is a Petty Officer Third Class holding the rate of Storekeeper, he or she would be referred to as Storekeeper Third Class or more commonly, SK3. With the recent merger of Storekeepers (SK) and Aviation Storekeepers (AK), Storekeepers can be found serving any Naval platform. For this reason, Storekeepers can be found with virtually every warfare pin offered by the Navy with only a few exceptions. Of the warfare qualification held by storekeepers, included are Aviation Warfare (AW), Surface Warfare (SW), Seabee Combat Warfare (SCW), Submarine Warfare Specialist (SS). The SK rate is also a source rating for Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the Navy SEALS, Navy Divers and SWCC. Thus Storekeepers can be stationed virtually anywhere and take on diverse duties. Training Storekeepers are trained at the Naval Technical Training Center in Meridian, Mississippi. Undesignated or non-rate sailors may also strike for SK without attending NTTC Meridian's Storekeeper \\"A\\" School. Coast Guard Storekeepers get training in Petaluma, California.

Hence, another modern English transliteration of his name is Leontius of Ruisi.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 156-163. Peeters Publishers, Apart from late annotations to the manuscripts of The Georgian Chronicles, an archbishop of Ruisi named Leonti is mentioned only thrice: once in an 11th-century manuscript from Mount Athos; once in Euthymius of Athos’s translation of Chrysostom’s commentary to St. Matthew; and, most specifically, on a 1066 inscription from the Trekhvi caves in central Georgia. Assumptions that Leonti Mroveli belonged to the eighth or early tenth century now seem implausible. This Mroveli no longer occupied the post in 1103, for he is not attested in the act of the Georgian ecclesiastic synod convened at Ruisi and the neighboring cathedral of Urbnisi by King David IV. Leonti is credited by some historians with having written several pieces of the medieval compendium of Georgian chronicles, while others consider him only a compiler of earlier texts. In any case, Leonti Mroveli as chronicler shifted the balance of Georgian literature from the ecclesiastic to the secular.

Administratively the park belongs to southern Warsaw's Ursynów district. The Kabaty Woods lie on flat ground, except for an east part comprising hills of dune origin. A striking landscape accent is a high escarpment above the glacial valley of the Vistula River, which forms the reserve's eastern border. The Kabaty Woods are a reservoir of fresh air for the surrounding housing developments, as well as a popular place of rest and recreation. The Woods are easily reached via buses and the Warsaw Metro. Origin of name The Kabaty Woods are named after Kabaty, a village that once stood on the picturesque banks of the Vistula River. The woods reserve has subsequently been named for Stefan Starzyński, Warsaw's patriotic mayor who in 1938 secured its purchase from private owners. During World War II, Starzyński was captured and executed by the Germans. Fauna and flora Despite the losses that the Kabaty Woods suffered during World War II, a unique multi-species vegetation and rich undergrowth survived. There are large areas covered with 120-160-year-old trees, with many monumental oaks, pines and beeches. In the upper floor grow oak, pine, birch, aspen, but also beech, larch, linden, maple, ash and elm. The old woods comprise linden, oak, hornbeam and maple. There are also apple, pear and cherry trees. The shrub layer includes hazel, and the rich undergrowth includes rare plants and protected species such as Lilium martagon, Lycopodium clavatum, Carex brizoides, as well as lilies-of-the valley. The rich plant environment favors a wealth of animals — deer, wild boar, fox, badger, weasel, pine marten, hedgehog — and various birds: buzzard, Eurasian hobby, kestrel, sparrow hawk, tawny owl, long-eared owl, green woodpecker and black woodpecker, wilson, crossbill, bullfinch and others. Particularly notable are the tree frog, blind worm, and grass snake. Hiking trails facilitate exploration of the Woods. Points of interest Monument to the victims of the 9 May 1987 crash of the airplane Tadeusz Kościuszko A point of interest, at the Woods' edge, is a historic forester's lodge built in 1890. Southeast of the Woods is the Wilanów-district community of Powsin, with two popular attractions: a culture park, and a Botanical Garden of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Near the western edge of the Kabaty Woods is a monument to the victims of the 9 May 1987 crash of the airplane Tadeusz Kościuszko. Located in the Kabaty Woods is the facility of the Air Operations Center and of its subordinate unit, the 21 Command and Guidance Center. These are responsible, respectively, for the air defense of Poland and of its capital, Warsaw. The facility is a multi-story underground command and analysis center. A plaque at the entrance states that, before World War II, Germany's Enigma ciphers were broken there. The Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which had been breaking the German ciphers at the General Staff Building (the Saxon Palace) since late 1932, had been transferred to the Kabaty Woods facility in 1937.Władysław Kozaczuk, Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher was Broken, and How it was Read by the Allies in World War Two, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, p. 43.

Early life and education Joris was born in Strasbourg, France on July 14, 1946 and raised in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg. He left Luxembourg at nineteen and since then has lived in the US, Great Britain, North Africa and France. After early studies in medicine in Paris, he decided to devote himself to literature, especially poetry, and to use English (his fourth language) as his writing language. In 1967 he moved to the US where he earned a BA (Honors) at Bard College before moving to New York City where he edited the underground arts magazine Corpus from 1969 to 1970. After moving to London, England in late 1971, Joris founded the literary magazine Sixpack (with William Prescott) which published a wide range of innovative poetries and translations from the US, Europe and beyond, and was instrumental in helping to create what came to be known as the British Poetry Revival of the 1970s. In 1975, Sixpack received a grant from the CCLM (Coordinating Council of Little Magazines) as well as that year's Fel's Literary Award. Between 1972 and 1975 Joris pursued graduate work, first in Cultural Studies at the University of London's Institute of United States Studies under the direction of Professor Eric Mottram, and then at Essex University where he earned an MA in the Theory and Practice of Literary Translation in 1975 under the guidance of visiting American poet Ted Berrigan. It was also in London, in 1972, that he published my first chapbook of poems (The Fifth Season). Career From 1976 to 1979 Joris taught in the English Department at the University of Constantine, Algeria, years that also led him to explore the wider Maghreb and especially the great Sahara desert. It is there that he met Zahia Matougui, who would be his companion and wife for the next thirteen years. He moved back to London in 1979 & in the early eighties taught in various institutions, such as the University of Maryland’s UK campuses, while expanding his career as a freelance writer and translator, reviewing, for instance, for the New Statesman, for which publication he also briefly wrote a “Letter from Paris,” and working as editor and writer for the Third World weekly al-Zahaf al- Akhdar. Relocating to Paris, Joris started working as author, commentator, actor & editor for France Culture, the National French radio station. During those years he would return annually to the U.S. for poetry readings and work with various collaborators on a range of translation projects. In 1987, invited by the Iowa International Writing Program (the first Luxemburger to be thus invited) to spend the fall in Iowa City, he used the occasion to relocate to the US. He first moved from Iowa to Binghamton, N.Y., where he started a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature he was to complete in 1990; from there he moved to San Diego where he was active as visiting poet in the University of California, San Diego Literature Department and would meet Nicole Peyrafitte. A range of projects started at this time: besides completing several collections of poems & a first volume of essays, Joris started a very fruitful collaboration with poet and anthologist Jerome Rothenberg. In 1993 the pair co-edited and co-translated pppppp : THE SELECTED WRITINGS OF KURT SCHWITTERS (Temple University Press) which received the 1994 Pen Center USA West Award for Translation, and the following year a Selected Poems of Pablo Picasso, under the title The Death of the Count of Orgaz & Other Writings. Joris and Rothenberg also began work on a two volume anthology of 20th Century Avant- Garde writings, POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM: A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOOK OF MODERN & POSTMODERN POETRY, the first volume of which was published by UCP in 95 and the second in 98. In 1992 Joris returned to the Mid-Hudson valley to take up a teaching post in the Department of English at SUNY-Albany, where he taught until his retirement in 2013. In 2009 he moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife Nicole Peyrafitte, a performance artist, painter & singer. The pair continue to collaborate in a range of ways, including performances with jazz musicians & co-teaching, for example in the summer sessions at the Jack Kerouac Institute at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. Peyrafitte has also illustrated and created covers for most of Joris’ books since 1992.

Originally from Georgia, Hart took up arms against Spain in the Patriot Rebellion of 1812. After moving to a location near the cow ford on the narrows of the St. Johns River, he began platting the town in 1822, and later served as postmaster, court clerk, commissioner of pilotage, judge of elections, major in the local militia during the Seminole War, and as a Whig member of the Florida Territorial Senate. The Isaiah D. Hart Bridge over the St. Johns River in Jacksonville is named after him. Early life Isaiah Hart's father, William Hart, a native of Pennsylvania, was a saddler by trade who moved south to Virginia and later settled in Burke County, Georgia, where Isaiah was born on November 6, 1792. In 1801, William Hart moved his family to East Florida when he received a land grant of 640 acres on Moncrief Creek and the Trout River from the Spanish governor. He and his sons Isaiah and Dan were citizens of Spanish Florida and served in the Spanish militia, but joined the so-called \\"Patriots of East Florida\\" during the Patriot War of East Florida, in which disaffected farmers and woodsmen, mostly from Georgia and led by rich planters, tried to seize control of East Florida from the Spanish in 1812. As a young man participating in Patriot raids, Isaiah Hart organized bands of marauders that raided Florida plantations for slaves and cattle, drove them northward into Georgia, and sold them. Isaiah Hart married Nancy Nelson in 1818 and settled at King's Ferry where the old King's Road crossed the St. Marys River. After the United States took control of Florida, Hart observed an increase in traffic on the road as settlers came south from Georgia and the Carolinas to the Florida Territory. In 1819, William Dawson and Stephen Buckles opened a general merchandise store on the King's Road, near the cow ford at the narrows of the St. Johns River, where John Brady operated a busy ferry service. Hart realized that the location offered economic opportunities, and on May 18, 1821, he bought 18 acres on the north bank of the St. Johns from Lewis Zachariah Hogans, owner of the surrounding land, which was formerly part of the Taylor Grant, for $72 worth of cattle. Here, to the west of present-day Market Street, he built a store-cum-tavern that served as his residence, as well as a riverfront dock called Hart's Landing. Over the years Hart became prosperous enough to establish himself as a man of means. He appears in the 1850 Jacksonville, Duval, Florida census taken 14 Oct 1850 with his wife and 7 children: Isiah D. Hart, age 57, planter, b Georgia, with wife Nancy, age 50, b South Carolina, and children: Oscar Hart, age 31, b South Carolina, a lawyer, Ossin Hart, age 29, b Georgia, a lawyer, Laura Hart, age 27, Lodiska Hart, 25, and Daniel Hart, age 20, a clerk, all born in Florida, Berry Briers, age 25, a laborer, born New York, Nancy Hart, age 18, listed as \\"idiotic\\", and Julia Hart, age 16, both born in Florida. It is written either in a history of the Hart family or of the City of Jacksonville that Laura and Julia Streets in downtown Jacksonville were named for two of Isaiah and Nancy's daughters.Source Citation Year: 1850; Census Place: Jacksonville, Duval, Florida; Roll: M432_58; Page: 90B; Image: 178 Source Information Ancestry.com. 1850 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

Founding of Jacksonville When Duval County was incorporated in 1822, Hart saw new opportunities for development, and persuaded his neighbors John Brady and Lewis Z. Hogans to join his enterprise of platting a town. In 1822, Hart, Brady and Hogans began to lay out the plan of the town, naming it after Gen. Andrew Jackson, the provisional governor of the Florida Territory. The men gathered near the north bank of the St. Johns River and laid out a grid of eight streets. By this time, Hart was becoming prominent in the Territory; in 1824 he was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal of East Florida, and in 1826 as the Clerk of the County Court, an office he held until 1845. He successively held public office as postmaster, commissioner of pilotage, and judge of elections in Duval County. Letter to Isaiah Hart from Amos Binney, dated August 9, 1838 By 1830 Hart owned four slaves and managed his own farming and ranching operations, as well as a timber business. He continued to buy more real estate, and by the mid-1830s had acquired 2,000 acres of land ten miles west of Jacksonville near present-day Marietta, where he established a plantation he called \\"Paradise\\". Hart's various enterprises prospered, and as his fortune increased, he invested in railroads and banks, and bought more slaves, eventually owning 57 human beings. He held various public offices and was admitted to the bar. Hart served as a major in the local militia during the Second Seminole War, and in 1839 was elected as a Whig to the Florida Territorial Senate. Although a slave owner himself, Hart supported the Union vocally and opposed secession, consequently becoming one of the founders of the Florida Whig Party. He maintained his stance on the issue while in the Territorial Senate. In 1859, Hart extended the original plat of Jacksonville to include all of his property, and moved the town business center to higher ground on a sand ridge. Here he set aside land for a public square (now Hemming Park), and surveyed smaller lots facing the square for the new shops and businesses that he anticipated would be built on Duval, Hogan and Monroe streets. Legacy When he died in 1861, Isaiah Hart was one of the richest men in Florida. He owned extensive real estate in north Florida, and had substantial stockholdings in the Florida, Atlantic & Gulf Central Railroad, the Jacksonville Natural Gas Company, the Bank of St. Johns County, and a steamship line, as well as 53 African-American slaves. His son, Ossian B. Hart, was active in the Republican Party, and became the tenth governor of Florida in 1873.

The city of Kapurthala is the district headquarters. Kapurthala District is one of the smallest districts of Punjab in terms of both area and population, with 815,168 people by the 2011 census. The district is divided into two noncontiguous parts, the main Kapurthala-Sultanpur Lodhi portion and the Phagwara tehsil or block. The Kapurthala-Sultanpur Lodhi part lies between north latitude 31° 07' and 31° 22' and east longitude 75° 36'. In the north it is bound by Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar districts, in the west by the Beas River and Amritsar district, and in south by the Sutlej River, Jalandhar district, and Hoshiarpur district. Phagwara tehsil lies between north latitude 31° 22' and east longitude 75° 40' and 75° 55'. Phagwara lies on the National Highway No 1, and the tehsil is much more industrially developed than the remainder of Kapurthala District. Phagwara is situated at a distance of southwest of Jalandhar, and the tehsil is bounded on all sides by Jalandhar District except in the northeast, where it is bounded by Hoshiarpur district. The district has three subdivisions/tehsils: Kapurthala, Phagwara, and Sultanpur Lodhi. The total area of the district is 1633 km² (630 mi²) of which 909.09 km² (350.91 mi²) is in Kapurthala tehsil, 304.05 km² (117.36 mi²) in Phagwara tehsil and 451.0 km² (174.1 mi²) in Sultanpur Lodhi tehsil. The economy of the district is still predominantly agricultural. The major crops are wheat, rice, sugarcane, potato and maize. The major portion of Kapurthala district lies between the Beas River and the Kali-Bein River and is called the ‘BET’ area. This area is prone to floods. Water logging and alkalinity in the soil is the major problem of the area. A flood protection bundh called ‘Dhussi Bundh’ has been constructed along the left bank of the Beas River, and it has saved the area from the ravages of flood. The entire district is an alluvial plain. To the south of the river Kali-Bein lies the tract known as ‘Dona’ meaning the soil formed of two constituents i.e. the sand and clay. The climate is typical of the Punjab plains i.e. hot in summers and cold in winters. It has sub-tropical continental monsoon type climate. Intensive cultivation in the district leaves no scope for forest cover and wildlife is practically nonexistent. Demographics According to the 2011 census Kapurthala district has a population of 815,168, roughly equal to the nation of Comoros or the US state of South Dakota. This gives it a ranking of 481st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 8.37%. Kapurthala has a sex ratio of 912 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 80.2%.

Men's service uniforms  U.S. Army basic service uniforms consisted of a winter service uniform of olive drab wool worn in temperate weather and a summer service uniform of khaki (tan) fabric. In addition to the service uniforms worn for ordinary duty and dress purposes there were a variety of fatigue and combat uniforms. Summer and winter service uniforms were during their respective seasons in the continental U.S. During World War II the European theater of operations (Northwestern Europe) was considered a year-round temperate uniform zone and the Pacific theater of operations a year-round tropical uniform zone. In the Mediterranean theater U.S. soldiers wore both seasonal uniforms.Table of Equipment No. 21 1 September 1945 Part II (theater clothing zones). =Enlisted men's service uniforms= Winter uniforms Army Enlisted Men's Winter Service Uniform The issue enlisted men's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a four-pocket wool serge coat in olive drab shade no. 33 (OD 33, also called \\"light shade\\") and matching trousers. Shirts, which featured two patch pockets and no shoulder straps, were either OD 33 wool flannel or khaki cotton chino cloth. Either shirt could be worn under the coat; however, the cotton shirt could not be worn as an outer garment with the wool trousers. Whenever a shirt was worn as an outer garment the necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39). The initial shirt had a standup collar like a typical dress shirt. In 1941 the shirt was redesigned with the collar band removed so the collar would lay flat when worn in the field.Stanton p.52AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 18). In 1941 the necktie for the winter uniform was black wool and the summer necktie was khaki cotton.AR 600-35 10 November 1941 In February 1942 a universal mohair wool necktie in olive drab shade 3 replaced both previous neckties. The OD 3 necktie was shortly superseded by a khaki cotton–wool blend necktie. The single khaki necktie was mandated for both summer and winter service uniforms.Risch and Pitkin, p. 47.AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a3). Summer uniforms The enlisted man's summer service uniform consisted of the cotton khaki uniform shirt with matching trousers; the coat for this uniform was discontinued for enlisted men in the 1930s. The necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39). Although originally used as a summer combat uniform as well as a summer dress uniform, after the invasion of the Philippines in 1942 the khaki uniform was largely replaced as a summer combat uniform by the herringbone twill utility uniform. Headgear The enlisted soldier's round crown visor caps were no longer issued to enlisted troops after 1942. Thereafter, only the garrison cap in either olive drab for winter or khaki for summer with piping in the color of the soldiers basic specialty branch remained as the universal enlisted service headgear. The soldiers distinctive unit insignia (DUI) was worn on the left front if the unit issued a DUI. However, after 1943 the manufacture of DUIs were suspended for the duration of the war.War Department Circular Number No. 6, January 2, 1943 Footwear Issue footwear consisted of low quarter russet brown leather cap toe boots. For more on Army footwear see combat uniforms below. =Officer's service uniforms= Winter uniforms The male officer's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a four-button, four-pocket coat of finer wool fabric in olive drab shade no. 51 (OD 51, also called \\"dark-shade\\") a very dark olive green with brownish hue, nicknamed \\"greens\\". The coat was worn with a russet brown leather Sam Brown belt until 1942 when the leather belt was replaced by a cloth belt of matching fabric to the coat. Officers could wear trousers matching the color and fabric of the coat, or optionally they were allowed trousers of a contrasting pale taupe, officially called \\"drab shade no. 54\\", of the same material as the coat, nicknamed \\"pinks\\", leading to the nickname \\"pinks and greens\\" for the combination.AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 9, 19). Officers were also authorized to use the more durable OD 33 enlisted uniforms, except for the enlisted men's four pocket service coat, as long as they were not mixed with OD 51 or taupe clothing.Army Officers Guide 1942, pp. 132. Officers shirts, unlike the enlisted shorts, included shoulder straps. Officers had additional shirt color and fabric options. In 1941 officers shirts included cotton or tropical worsted wool khaki shirts that could be worn with either the summer or winter service uniforms and wool shirts in OD 33 or OD 51 with the winter uniform. Additionally, in 1944 shade No. 54 taupe shirts matching the trousers were authorized. Officers wore black and khaki neckties with winter and summer uniforms respectively, like enlisted soldiers, until after February 1942 when the universal neckties were changed to khaki for all ranks. As with enlisted men, officers could not wear khaki shirts as an outer garment with the wool uniform. The shirt had to be either the same shade OD as the trousers or OD 51 with the taupe trousers. Summer uniforms Audie Murphy photographed in 1948 wearing the U.S. Army khaki summer service uniform with full-size medals. Male officer's summer service uniforms usually consisted of the wash-and-wear cotton khaki uniforms like those of the enlisted men, the main difference being that the shirts had shoulder straps added. However, for dress purposes officers also had the option of purchasing a khaki summer service uniform of tropical weight suiting fabric. The coat of the uniform was identical in cut to the winter officers' uniform. However, the cloth belt of the winter service coat was omitted.AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a2). Headgear Officer's headgear for the winter uniform consisted of either an OD-51 peaked service cap with a russet leather visor or a garrison cap matching the OD fabric shade worn. The garrison cap for officers was piped around the curtain with black and gold cord except for general officers whose piping was all gold. The officer's rank insignia was worn on the left front side of the garrison cap. The service cap was also available in khaki tan with a removable top to be worn with the khaki summer uniform. Optionally khaki garrison caps were worn with the summer khaki uniform with the same piping as the winter OD version. Footwear Footwear normally consisted of russet-brown leather Type I (leather-soled) service shoes. =Eisenhower jacket= One of General Eisenhower's personal jackets During the war in Europe a short jacket was adopted by General Eisenhower as an option to the 4 pocket service coat. The \\"Eisenhower jacket\\", or \\"Ike jacket\\", was popular. It closely resembled the short British Battle Dress jacket that inspired it. However, development and approval by the Army was slow. Except for small runs of jackets made for soldiers in England, the U.S. Army did not provide the jacket as an issue item to enlisted soldiers until the war in Europe was almost over. There were several versions. Two Ike jackets were manufactured in England and issued to troops in Europe before the jackets were approved Army wide. Both of these were essentially wool versions of the 1941 pattern poplin field jacket.Enjames, Henri-Paul, \\"Government Issue:U.S. Army European Theater of Operations collectors Guide\\",Histoire & Collections p.37 These jackets were authorized only in the ETO. There were also non-standard conversions made for GIs particularly officers by tailors in the United Kingdom with degrees of variation. The standard-issue M44 (Model 1944) Wool Field Jacket, made of fine-quality Olive Drab (OD 33) wool, was originally designed as a liner to be worn under the M1943 combat jacket. While originally intended as a field or combat jacket, it was nearly always reserved for service or dress wear. The M44 ultimately replaced the four button service dress jacket for enlisted troops. However, the phase out of the enlisted service coat was only completed after the war was over.Stanton, Shelby L., \\"U.S. Army uniforms of the Korean War\\", Stackpole Books (1992) p.104. =Wear of insignia and badges= With the service uniform the enlisted arm- and branch-of-service insignia was embossed on circular pins, while the officer's insignia was \\"free work\\" (i.e., open design with no backing). Officer's arm-of-service pins (\\"U.S.\\" for the Regular Army) were worn on the upper lapels and their branch of service pins were worn on their lower lapels. EM wore the US disk on the right and the branch disk on the left upper lapel. The rank of officers was worn on the outer edge of the shoulder loops whereas enlisted soldiers wore rank chevrons three inches wide points up on both upper arms. Organizational patches were worn on the left upper shoulder only. When the coat was worn no insignia was worn on the shirts except sew on patches. When the shirt was worn as an outer garment officer's wore pin on insignia on the shirt. Until 1942 the officer's US pin was worn on the right collar point and the officer's branch insignia was worn on the left. The officer's rank was worn on the outer ends of the officer's shoulder loops as on the coat. After, September 1942 the US pin was deleted and the rank of the wearer was displayed on the right collar point. Distinctive Unit Insignia pins (featuring the unit's coat-of-arms) were worn in the center of the epaulet for officers and on lower lapels for enlisted men. These devices were rarely seen during the war as a metal conservation measure. Wound Chevrons (awarded from 1918 to 1932 for wounds in combat) were worn on the lower right sleeve between the cuff and the elbow. Service Stripes, or \\"Hash Marks\\", (awarded for every 3 years of service) were worn on the lower left sleeve. World War I Overseas Chevrons [created 1918] and/or World War II Overseas Bars [created 1944] (awarded for each six months combat service overseas) were worn on the lower left sleeve between the elbow and lower sleeve, but above the Service Stripes. The World War II Bars were worn over the World War I Chevrons. After 1953 the Service Stripes were kept on the lower left sleeve and the Overseas Service Stripes were moved to the lower right sleeve. Parachutist's Wings, Pilot's Wings, the Expert Infantryman Badge, the Combat Infantryman Badge, or the Combat Medical Badge are worn above the left top tunic pocket. Discharged soldiers returning home wore the embroidered Honorable Discharge Emblem (or \\"Ruptured duck\\") on the uniform over the right top tunic pocket on a diamond-shaped Olive Drab cloth backing. American and foreign medals or medal ribbons are worn above the left top tunic pocket. American and foreign Unit citation ribbons are worn over the right top tunic pocket. The Meritorious Unit Commendation patch [created 1944] (awarded to a unit for at least 6 months of exemplary combat service or combat support) is worn on the lower right sleeve above the cuff and below the Wound Chevrons. Women's service uniforms Female members of the U.S. Army during WWII were assigned to either the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) or the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC/WAC). The ANC preceded the WAAC/WAC so the two branches had separate uniform distinctions. =Army Nurse Corps uniforms= Prior to 1943, the ANC winter service uniform consisted of the ANC pattern dark blue cap or garrison cap with maroon piping, suit jacket with maroon cuff braid and gold army buttons, light blue or white shirt, black tie and light blue skirt, shoes were black or white. The ANC summer service uniform consisted of a similar suit in beige with maroon shoulder strap piping and cuff braid, beige ANC cap or beige garrison cap with maroon piping, white shirt, and black four-in-hand tie. During World War II the first flight nurses uniform consisted of a blue wool battle dress jacket, blue wool trousers and a blue wool men's style maroon piped garrison cap. The uniform was worn with either the ANC light blue or white shirt and black tie. After 1943 the ANC adopted olive drab service uniforms similar to the newly formed WAC. Nurses wore Army hospital whites on ward duty.Smith, Jill H. (2001). Dressed for Duty: America's Women in Uniform 1898–1973. San Jose, California: R. James Bender Publishing, p. 241-244. Randolph Field, 1944 =WAAC and WAC Uniforms= In May 1942 Congress approved the creation of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps.Creation of the Women's Army Corps. U.S. Army. Retrieved from https://www.army.mil/women/history/wac.html Although the ANC were actual service members of the U.S. Army, the members of the WAAC were not, so they wore Army style uniforms with distinctly different insignia than U.S. Army service members. In the summer of 1943 the WAAC was converted to the Women's Army Corps (WAC). From that point the WAC were U.S. Army service members and their insignia was changed to that of the regular army.Bellafaire, Judith A. “ The Women's Army Corps: A Commemoration of WWII Service.” The Women's Army Corps, Center of Military History, 17 Feb. 2005, history.army.mil/brochures/WAC/WAC.HTM. Female service dress went through an evolution of patterns over the course of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern \\"Hobby\\" hat or women's garrison cap, a women's suit coat, shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, russet leather women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool \\"Ike jacket\\" was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off-duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. After the WAC were established the ANC adopted the WAC officer's uniforms, except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. However, those items were changed to olive drab and russet leather respectively. The ANC off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The previous ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon.AR 600-37 16 April 1945 Combat and utility uniform The United States Army during the inter-war period followed the previous model of having a standard uniform that combined elements of both the Class A (basic service uniform) and Class B (basic field uniform). By combining the uniforms, it was thought that time and money could be saved. Included in the clothing system was an olive drab (OD) wool garrison cap, olive drab wool trousers, an olive drab wool collared shirt worn with a black tie, an olive drab wool four button coat, and russet brown Type I (leather- soled) or Type II (rubber-soled) service shoes. An outer jacket or coat, either the Model 1938 \\"Overcoat, Mackinaw, Roll Collar\\" or the M1941 Field Jacket, nicknamed the \\"Parson jacket\\" after its designer, in olive drab shade No. 3 (OD3) was issued. The basic field or combat uniform for temperate or cool climates consisted of the basic wool uniform, without tie, along with a field jacket or wool overcoat, leggings, helmet and web gear. In the European theater of operations (ETO), the basic wool uniform saw the most use and had the greatest functionality, being able to keep the soldier warm in the winter with its insulation and relatively cool and breathable in Northern European summer weather. However, the M-1941 field jacket came in for considerable criticism; it was poorly insulated and the light cotton shell provided little protection from wind or rain. In addition, the OD3 coloring was deemed inappropriate for use in northern Europe, as it stood out against most backdrops, making soldiers more visible targets. Infantryman wearing HBT first pattern uniform =Herringbone twill uniform= Additionally, a fatigue uniform was issued, made of 8.2-ounce heavy cotton herringbone twill (HBT) cloth. The uniform consisted of a shirt, trousers, and a hat. Initially, this was a circular-brimmed \\"clamdigger\\"-style hat which was later replaced by a billed cap that was based on a design used by railroad workers. Initially it was meant to be worn over the basic wool or cotton uniforms to provide protection during fatigue duties, but it proved to be much better material than the primary wool uniform for hot weather, as so it saw use as a combat uniform in nearly all of the major theaters of combat in which the US was involved.Stanton, Shelby L., U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II, Stackpole Books (1995), , , p. 101 The original 1941 version came in a light sage green color that faded with repeated washing. The later 1943 version had small changes in tailoring and came in a darker olive drab shade No. 7, matching the new M1943 version of the field jacket. =The M-1943 field uniform= The M-1943 uniform came into service in the later half of World War II. The uniform was designed as a layered system, meant to be worn over the wool shirt and trousers and in conjunction with a wool sweater and liners in colder weather. The most recognizable part of the uniform is the standardized M-1943 field jacket. It was longer than the earlier 1941 field jacket, coming down to the upper thighs. It was made of windproof cotton sateen and was issued in a new darker olive drab color, OD7. The jacket also had a detachable hood, drawstring waist, two large angled breast pockets, and two lower skirt pockets. The trousers were made out of the same OD7 cotton sateen material and white cotton twill inner lining, and were equipped with both front and rear pockets. They also had buttoned tabs at the waist in order to cinch the waist. For airborne troops, treated canvas cargo pockets were added to the trousers. In the ETO, initial issuance of the M-1943 was slowed as a consequence of opposition by some U.S. commanders. However, as U.S. and Allied troops pushed into Germany, more M-1943 uniforms or components of the uniform were issued as the supply situation (including replacements directly from stateside arrived) and the weather became harsher as winter arrived. In use, the M-1943 was very popular with the men in the field, being relatively comfortable and having large amounts of pocket space. =Experimental tropical uniform= In 1943, after extensive testing in the swamplands and jungles of Florida and Panama, the U.S. Army determined that an experimental tropical uniform made of Byrd Cloth (known in Britain as Grenfell Cloth), would best protect soldiers from insects and disease while cooling the body and minimizing losses from perspiration.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 191-195 Byrd Cloth, as used in the Experimental Tropical Uniform, was a single-layer uniform of untreated OD long-staple Egyptian cotton, made in a tightly woven herringbone twill to prevent mosquito bites. In use, the uniform was intended to cool the wearer even when continuously wetted, as might be expected in a humid, rainy jungle environment. The uniform featured a short-tailed shirt, trousers with cuffs fitted with half-inch boottop fastening tapes, and a flap-protected fly to keep out crawling insects such as leeches, ticks, and chiggers.Stanton, Shelby L., U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II, Stackpole Books (1995), , , pp. 88-89 Pockets were shallow and kept to a minimum to increase cooling; users carried all their gear in load-bearing belts, suspenders, or in low-mounted field packs designed to minimize body contact (jungle packs). The uniform, always in short supply because of a shortage of Byrd Cloth, was used in combat by members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)Jowett, Philip S. and Walsh, Stephen, The Chinese Army 1937-49: World War II and Civil War, Osprey Publishing (2005), , , p. 45 and the Mars Task Force (Army 5332nd Brigade- Provisional) in Burma.Mars Task Force: A Short History http://cbi- theater-8.home.comcast.net/~cbi-theater-8/mars/marstaskforce.html Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 191Stanton, Shelby L., U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II, Stackpole Books (1995), , , p. 89 Because of the shortage of suitable weaving machines and resultant cost of weaving Byrd Cloth, a less expensive 5-ounce OD cotton poplin shirt and trouser were issued on an experimental basis in 1944 for use in jungle and tropical regions; while reports were favorable, existing HBT stockpiles were deemed adequate, and the uniform was not adopted. =Women's fatigue uniforms= Nurses wore Army hospital whites on ward duty although a seersucker version with brown and white stripes was created because the whites were hard to maintain in some overseas areas. This dress was inspired by a WAC seersucker version the same color. Sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case in overseas areas, men's issue work/fatigue clothing was used instead.Smith, Jill H. (2001). Dressed for Duty: America's Women in Uniform 1898–1973. San Jose, California: R. James Bender Publishing, p. 241. The M1942 HBT \\"clamdigger\\" utility hat was used extensively by the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. They wore it with the back of the brim flipped up and the front of the brim pulled down and nicknamed it the \\"Daisy Mae Cap\\". It replaced the WAACs' distinctive \\"Hobby Hat\\" kepi for field use and fatigue duties. Footwear Army combat footwear in World War II originally consisted of a basic tanned leather shoe, used with heavy canvas leggings, the Model 1939 \\"Shoes, Service, Composition Sole\\", or Type I Service Shoe. This was an ankle-high field shoe made of tanned leather in a dark red or russet color, originally with leather soles. The sole was changed to a rubber composition after 1940 and designated as the Type II Service Shoe. Soon after the US entry into the war these shoes, which were also used as part of the Class A dress uniform, were replaced with a \\"roughout\\" field shoe made from leather uppers with a sueded outer finish, and designated the Type III Service Shoe. The Marine Corps version of these shoes were commonly referred to as \\"boondockers\\". In November 1943, the Type II and III service shoes were in turn replaced by a boot, the M43 Combat Boot or \\"Two-Buckle Boot\\". This boot had a permanently attached a two-buckled leather ankle flap, which was designed to replace the unpopular canvas leggings. The sole was made of synthetic or reclaimed rubber. Due to supply issues, soldiers can be seen wearing both the service shoes with the leggings and the newer combat boot. =Specialized combat footwear= A rubber-soled, canvas-top Jungle boot was issued during the war for use by soldiers in the tropical and jungle environments typically encountered in the China-Burma-India (CBI) and the Pacific theaters. The 10th Mountain Division's troopers occasionally wore the Mountain Boot, a low-quarter brown leather boot with a square toe and rocker- type sole, though this boot was phased out in favor of the Type III Combat Boot in the last year of the war. In 1944, the M-44 Combat Boot, a high-top leather boot with full laces was adopted for service, but for the duration it was primarily worn by soldiers on stateside duty. Parachute troops beginning in 1942 were issued Jump boots – high-lacing rubber-soled leather boots which were intended to provide additional ankle support when landing by parachute. Although these boots were to be replaced by the new M43 combat boots, jump boots continued to be worn throughout the war. Nicknamed \\"Corcorans\\", from the name of the first contractor to manufacture them, they have become a status symbol as the footwear of paratroopers and Rangers. Overshoes were normally issued to Army units during winter operations. In January 1945, some Army units operating in the ETO received shoepacs for wet winter wear. The shoepac was a leather boot with rubberized lower top and sole, worn in conjunction with the wool ski sock. While it was effective in keeping feet protected from soaking and freezing ground, the shoepac lacked foot support and tended to wear quickly; it also resulted in incidents of foot injuries when a soldier wearing shoepacs on a march in freezing weather stopped to rest, allowing perspiration-soaked socks inside the boot to freeze.Stanton, Shelby L., U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II, Stackpole Books (1995), , , p. 242 See also *Uniforms of the United States Army *Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps *History of the United States Army *United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II References External links *Military Uniforms Color Catalog Life Magazine, May 19, 1941 *World War II Living History and Reenacting Information *90th Infantry Division Preservation Group Uniform and Equipment Section Category:World War II military equipment of the United States Category:United States Army uniforms Category:United States Army in World War II ","title":"United States Army uniforms in World War II"},{"id":"3397376","text":"USS Rhind (DD-404) was a Benham-class destroyer in the United States Navy. She was named for Alexander Colden Rhind. Rhind (DD-404) was laid down 22 September 1937 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched 28 July 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Frederick S. Camp; and commissioned 10 November 1939, Commander G. R. Cooper in command. Initial Duties Following an extended -shakedown cruise to Brazil and postshakedown availability, Rhind steamed south again and from 5 July to 19 December 1940 conducted exercises in the Caribbean and patrolled off Martinique. Employed as carrier escort and engaged in fleet exercises during the first half of 1941, she joined TF 1 in June and through the northern summer steamed in the North Atlantic shipping lanes on Neutrality Patrol. In August she escorted Augusta (CA-31), with President Franklin D. Roosevelt embarked, to Newfoundland for the Atlantic Charter conferences. Then, at their conclusion, she escorted HMS Prince of Wales, carrying Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to Iceland. On 17 August she returned to patrol duty off the Newfoundland coast. Detached in October, Rhind escorted Yorktown (CV-5) from midocean to Halifax, Nova Scotia in early November, then joined a Halifax-Cape Town convoy as escort. Off Southwest Africa 27 November, she was detailed to escort Ranger (CV-4) to Trinidad. They arrived 3 December. Four days later the United States entered World War II. Enters the War Rhind then steamed north to patrol the waters off Bermuda. In February 1942, she shifted further north and through March escorted Icelandic convoys. In April she shepherded a convoy to the Panama Canal Zone and on the 23rd, while en route back to New York, conducted her first depth charge attack on a German submarine. The U-boat had shelled a Norwegian merchantman off New Jersey. Arriving at New York the same day, she departed again on the 30th to escort convoy AT-15 to Iceland. There, on 15 May, she joined TF 99 and for the next 3 months operated with that force and the British Home Fleet in hunting German units operating out of Norway to intercept convoys to Murmansk and Archangel. Return to Americas Rhind returned to the United States in July. In August she escorted coastal convoys between Boston and NS Argentia, then turned south to conduct ASW operations off the southeastern coast and in the Caribbean. Exercises in the Casco Bay area followed in early October and on the 24th she got underway for North Africa. Screening Massachusetts (BB-59) en route she arrived off the Moroccan coast on the night of 7 November. During the Naval Battle of Casablanca on the 8th she shelled Vichy vessels attempting to repel the Allied invasion of North Africa and blasted shore batteries. Through the 12th, she supported the troops ashore and screened larger ships in the Fedhala-Casablanca area. Back at Hampton Roads 20 November, the destroyer resumed escort duty and into the new year, 1943, guarded convoys to North Africa. On 28 April she returned to New York with convoy GUS-6, which had departed, as UGS-6, 4 March and had lost five merchantmen to a wolfpack between the 13th and 17th. On 10 May, Rhind departed New York again for North Africa, escorting a troopship convoy, and arrived at Algiers 2 June. For the next month she conducted ASW patrols and escorted ships along the North African coast. Invasion of Sicily On 10 July the invasion of Sicily began. On the 14th Rhind arrived off the coast, in the screen of a reinforcement convoy and joined the antiaircraft defense and fire-support group. Through the 20th she patrolled off Gela, then shifted to Palermo. After screening the mine and patrol craft which cleared the harbor, she remained on antiaircraft station. On the 26th, as she stood by the heavily damaged Mayrant (DD-402) taking off wounded and assisting in salvage work, she sustained several casualties and some damage to her hull from a near miss delivered by a Junkers 88. Through 2 August she continued to patrol off Palermo, then on the 3rd, commenced offensive sweeps near Messina, sinking an E-boat on the first day, and supported \\"leap frog\\" landings along the coast. Caught in another air raid on the 22nd, Rhind gained a brief respite at Oran, but suffered further near misses while escorting a convoy to Bizerte through September. At Bizerte on the 6th, she fought off another raid, an attempt to disrupt the forces staging for the invasion at Salerno. On the 9th, the destroyer arrived in the Gulf of Salerno and continued her war with the Luftwaffe. On the 11th she got underway for Oran, whence, for the next month and a half, Rhind escorted reinforcements to Italy. In November she sailed for New York and, after guarding two New York to United Kingdom convoys, shifted to coastwise and Caribbean escort duty interspersed with offensive ASW activities. On 26 July 1944 she resumed transatlantic convoy duty with a run to the United Kingdom. A convoy to Naples followed in late September and, in November and December, she screened carrier Shangri-La (CV-38) on her shakedown cruise. The Pacific Between January and March 1945 Rhind continued coastal and Caribbean escort duty. Then after another run to Britain, 23 March to 18 April, she prepared for transfer to the Pacific Theater. Sailing 5 May, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 30th; and, after exercises there, steamed westward in the screen of carriers Lexington (CV-16), Hancock (CV-19), and Cowpens (CVL-25). On 20 June, the carriers launched strikes against Wake Island. Then, minus Cowpens and an escort, the force continued on to Leyte, arriving 26 June. From Leyte, Rhind steamed to Ulithi, whence she escorted cargo and troop ships to Okinawa and conducted ASW patrols in the Carolines. Shifted to Saipan in August, she escorted another convoy to Okinawa after the cessation of hostilities, then on 2 September steamed to Pagan Island where Commodore Vernon F. Grant accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrisoned there. After the war Returning to Saipan the same day, Rhind accompanied landing craft to Marcus Island. Then, on the 16th, headed north for Iwo Jima, whence she patrolled on air/sea rescue station until 2 November. She returned to Saipan on the 4th and operated in the Marianas Islands until mid-December when she got underway for the United States. Arriving at San Diego, California 30 December, she was stripped and returned to Pearl Harbor and prepared for experimental testing. On 15 May she joined Joint Task Force 1 for Operation Crossroads, the atomic test series scheduled to be detonated at Bikini Atoll in July. Fate Surviving the tests on 1 and 25 July, but highly contaminated, Rhind was decommissioned 26 August 1946 and moved to Kwajalein where, after radiological clearance had been given and further examinations had been made, she was sunk, 22 March 1948. Her name was struck from the Navy list 5 April 1948. As of 2006, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Rhind. Honors Rhind earned four battle stars during World War II.

This real-valued function of a real variable can be defined as: :f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{q} &\\\\text{if }x=\\\\tfrac{p}{q}\\\\quad (x \\\\text{ is rational), with }p \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z \\\\text{ and } q \\\\in \\\\mathbb N \\\\text{ coprime} 0 &\\\\text{if }x\\\\text{ is irrational.} \\\\end{cases} Since every rational number has a unique representation with coprime (also termed relatively prime) p \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\; and q \\\\in \\\\mathbb N, the function is well- defined. Note that q=+1 is the only number in \\\\mathbb N that is coprime to p=0. It is a modification of the Dirichlet function, which is 1 at rational numbers and 0 elsewhere. Properties *Thomae's function f is bounded and maps all real numbers to the unit interval:\\\\;f: \\\\mathbb R\\\\; \\\\rightarrow \\\\;[0,\\\\; 1]. *f is periodic with period 1:\\\\; f(x + n) = f(x)\\\\; for all integer and all real . For all x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q\\\\;:\\\\quad f(x+n) = f(x)= 0, since (x+n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q\\\\; \\\\Rightarrow x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q. For all x \\\\in \\\\mathbb Q,\\\\; there exist p \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\; and \\\\;q \\\\in \\\\mathbb N, such that \\\\;x = p/q,\\\\; and \\\\gcd(p,\\\\;q) = 1. Consider x + n = (p + n q) / q. If d divides p and q, it divides p + n q and p. Conversely, if d divides p + n q and q, it divides (p + n q) - n q = p and q. So \\\\gcd(p + n q, q) = \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1, and f(x + n) = 1 / q = f(x). *f is discontinuous at all rational numbers, dense within the real numbers. Assume an arbitrary rational x_0 = p/q,\\\\; with \\\\;p \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z,\\\\; q \\\\in \\\\mathbb N \\\\; and \\\\; (p,\\\\; q)\\\\, coprime. This establishes \\\\quad f(x_0) = 1/q. Let \\\\;\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q\\\\; be any irrational number and define for all \\\\; i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N,\\\\; \\\\quad x_i = x_0 + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{i}. These x_i are all irrational, and so \\\\quad f(x_i) = 0. This implies \\\\quadx_0 - x_i = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{i},\\\\quad and \\\\quad f(x_0) - f(x_i) = \\\\frac{1}{q}. Taking \\\\;\\\\varepsilon = 1/q\\\\; and \\\\;i= 1 + \\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\delta }\\\\right\\\\rceil\\\\; selects an \\\\;x_i,\\\\; such that :f(x_0) - f(x_i)= 1/q \\\\ge \\\\varepsilon\\\\quad and for all \\\\delta > 0\\\\;:\\\\;x_0 - x_i =\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1 + \\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\delta }\\\\right\\\\rceil} < \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\delta}\\\\right\\\\rceil} \\\\le \\\\delta, which is exactly the definition of discontinuity of f at x_0. This shows that f is discontinuous on \\\\;\\\\mathbb Q. *f is continuous at all irrational numbers, also dense within the real numbers. Since f is periodic with period 1,\\\\; and 0\\\\in \\\\mathbb Q,\\\\; it suffices to check all irrational points in I=(0,\\\\;1).\\\\; Assume now \\\\varepsilon > 0,\\\\; i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N\\\\; and x_0 \\\\in I \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q.\\\\; According to the Archimedean property of the reals, there exists r \\\\in \\\\mathbb N\\\\; with \\\\; 1/r < \\\\varepsilon ,\\\\; and there exist \\\\; k_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N,\\\\; such that for \\\\quad 1 \\\\le i \\\\le r,\\\\; i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N \\\\; : \\\\quad 0 < \\\\frac{k_i}{i} < x_0 < \\\\frac{(k_i +1)}{i}. The minimal distance of x_0 to its i-th lower and upper bounds equals :d_i := \\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\;x_0 - \\\\frac{k_i}{i},\\\\; x_0 - \\\\frac{(k_i + 1)}{i} \\\\;\\\\\\\\}. We define \\\\delta as the minimum of all the finitely many d_i. :\\\\delta := \\\\min_{1\\\\le i\\\\le r}\\\\\\\\{d_i\\\\\\\\},\\\\; so that for all \\\\quad 1 \\\\le i \\\\le r\\\\; : \\\\quad x_0 - k_i/i \\\\ge \\\\delta\\\\quad and \\\\quadx_0 - (k_i+1)/i \\\\ge \\\\delta.

Likewise, for all irrational x \\\\in I, \\\\; f(x) = 0 = f(x_0);\\\\; and thus, if \\\\varepsilon > 0 then any choice of (sufficiently small) \\\\delta > 0 gives : x - x_0 < \\\\delta \\\\implies f(x_0) - f(x) = f(x) < \\\\varepsilon. Therefore, f is continuous on \\\\mathbb R \\\\smallsetminus \\\\mathbb Q.\\\\quad *f is nowhere differentiable. :* For rational numbers, this follows from non-continuity. :* For irrational numbers: ::All sequences of irrational numbers (a_i e x_0)_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\,,\\\\; converging to the irrational point x_0,\\\\; imply a constant sequence (f(a_i)=0)_{i=1}^\\\\infty,\\\\; identical to 0,\\\\; and so \\\\lim_{i\\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\left\\\\frac{f(a_i)-f(x_0)}{a_i - x_0}\\\\right = 0. ::According to Hurwitz's theorem, there also exists a sequence of rational numbers (b_i = k_i/i)_{i=1}^\\\\infty,\\\\; converging to x_0,\\\\; with (k_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z,\\\\;i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N) coprime and k_i/i - x_0 < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{5}\\\\cdot i^2}.\\\\; ::Thus for all i\\\\,:\\\\;\\\\left \\\\frac{f(b_i)-f(x_0)}{b_i - x_0} \\\\right  > \\\\frac{1/i - 0}{1/(\\\\sqrt{5}\\\\cdot i^2)} =\\\\sqrt{5}\\\\cdot i e 0\\\\; and so at all irrational x_0. *f has a strict local maximum at each rational number. ::See the proofs for continuity and discontinuity above for the construction of appropriate neighbourhoods, maxima. *f is Riemann integrable on any interval and the integral evaluates to 0 over any set. ::The Lebesgue criterion for integrability states that a bounded function is Riemann integrable if and only if the set of all discontinuities has measure zero. Every countable subset of the real numbers - such as the rational numbers - has measure zero, so the above discussion shows that Thomae's function is Riemann integrable on any interval. The function's integral is equal to 0 over any set because the function is equal to zero almost everywhere. Related probability distributions Empirical probability distributions related to Thomae's function appear in DNA sequencing. The human genome is diploid, having two strands per chromosome. When sequenced, small pieces (\\"reads\\") are generated: for each spot on the genome, an integer number of reads overlap with it. Their ratio is a rational number, and typically distributed similarly to Thomae's function. If pairs of positive integers m,n are sampled from a distribution f(n,m) and used to generate ratios q=n/(n+m), this gives rise to a distribution g(q) on the rational numbers. If the integers are independent the distribution can be viewed as a convolution over the rational numbers, g(a/(a+b))=\\\\sum_{t=1}^\\\\infty f(ta)f(tb). Closed form solutions exist for power-law distributions with a cut-off. If f(k)=k^{-\\\\alpha} e^{-\\\\beta k}/\\\\mathrm{Li}_\\\\alpha(e^{-\\\\beta}) (where \\\\mathrm{Li}_\\\\alpha is the polylogarithm function) then g(a/(a+b)) = (ab)^{-\\\\alpha} \\\\mathrm{Li}_{2\\\\alpha}(e^{-(a+b)\\\\beta})/\\\\mathrm{Li}^2_{\\\\alpha}(e^{-\\\\beta}). In the case of uniform distributions on the set \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots , L\\\\\\\\} g(a/(a+b)) = (1/L^2) \\\\lfloor L/\\\\max(a,b) \\\\rfloor, which is very similar to Thomae's function. Both their graphs have fractal dimension 3/2. The ruler function For integers, the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n gives 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, ... . If 1 is added, or if the 0s are removed, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, ... . The values resemble tick-marks on a 1/16th graduated ruler, hence the name. These values correspond to the restriction of the Thomae function to the dyadic rationals: those rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2. Related functions A natural follow-up question one might ask is if there is a function which is continuous on the rational numbers and discontinuous on the irrational numbers. This turns out to be impossible; the set of discontinuities of any function must be an set. If such a function existed, then the irrationals would be an set. The irrationals would then be the countable union of closed sets \\\\textstyle\\\\bigcup_{i = 0}^\\\\infty C_i, but since the irrationals do not contain an interval, nor can any of the C_i. Therefore, each of the C_i would be nowhere dense, and the irrationals would be a meager set. It would follow that the real numbers, being a union of the irrationals and the rationals (which is evidently meager), would also be a meager set. This would contradict the Baire category theorem: because the reals form a complete metric space, they form a Baire space, which cannot be meager in itself. A variant of Thomae's function can be used to show that any subset of the real numbers can be the set of discontinuities of a function.

Green (March 3, 1873 - November 21, 1952) was an American trade union leader. Green is best remembered as the president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) from 1924 to 1952. He was a strong supporter for labor-management co-operation and was on the frontline for wage and benefit protections and industrial unionism legislation. As president of the AFL, he continued the development of the federation away from the foundations of \\"pure and simple unionism\\" to a more politically active \\"social reform unionism.\\" Early life Green was born March 3, 1873 in Coshocton, Ohio, the son of Welsh immigrants. His father was a coal miner. Green went to work himself in the coal mines in 1889, at 16.\\"William F. Green (1873-1952)\\", AFLCIO.org; accessed February 19, 2016. Union career He became involved in the trade union movement as a young miner and was elected as secretary of the Coshocton Progressive Miners Union in 1891. The Coshocton Progressive Miners Union later became a local of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In 1890, Green became the subdistrict president of the UMWA; he became UMWA Ohio district president in 1906. In 1910, he was elected to the Ohio Senate, where he served as both Senate president pro tempore and Democratic floor leader. As Ohio state senator, Green drafted and got passed a model Workmen’s Compensation Act in 1911. His accomplishments as state senator included Progressive Era legislation, including bills to limit the hours of women wage earners, institute a 1% income tax, elect Ohio's US senators by popular vote, and run judicial nonpartisan elections. Green’s experience and accomplishments contributed to his appointment as the UMWA's international statistician in 1911 and then as promotion to secretary-treasurer in 1913. He was named to the AFL's Executive Council in 1914 and became Secretary-Treasurer in 1916. His intensive involvement in labor had him serve as one of five delegates to the Paris Peace Conference in 1918. Reuben Soderstrom, circa 1935. In 1924, he became president of the AFL following the death of Samuel Gompers, he held the position until his own death. In 1933, Green's endeavors persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to appoint him to the Labor Advisory Council of the National Recovery Administration. The following year, Green served on the National Labor Board. Later, President Harry Truman appointed Green to the National Advisory Committee on Mobilization during the Korean War. He is best remembered for having presided over the split in the AFL, which led to the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Strategy Under Green's presidency in the 1920s, the AFL changed its political strategy of confrontation to one of co-operation. Unlike Green, Gompers had frequently projected an independent and confrontational approach for the federation, despite his affiliation to the National Civic Federation and to the Wilson administration. Green favored a more co-operative style for the labor movement. He won public support for legislating benefits for all workers and co-operated with employers in the name of mutual self-interest and the collective good. Green supported union-management co-operation in everyday functions at the workplace. He also supported reducing hours of labor, as it would increase the worker's living standards and participation for civic engagement. Ultimately, Green supported a voluntary incomes policy between labor and management, binding higher wages to productivity growth. Accomplishments Green's support was critical to winning passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932, which reduced the practice of labor restrictions and banned the yellow-dog contract. Green was also successful in acquiring federation support for a national unemployment insurance system, sponsored largely by employer donations. In 1935, Green facilitated the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, aimed at empowering workers' rights to organize and take part in collective bargaining. In 1938, Green helped pass the Fair Labor Standards Act, becoming the first federal law in instituting minimum wages and the 40-hour workweek. Death Green died November 21, 1952, at 79 in Coshocton, Ohio.1996 Labor Hall of Fame article, dol.gov; accessed February 19, 2016. He was buried in South Lawn Cemetery. Legacy Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois named its library after Green and colleague Philip Murray in the 1960s to distinguish the functions that unions played in the university's founding in 1945. The library honored their service in American labor and their contributions in funding educational opportunities for everyone. The Chicago Housing Authority named the William Green Homes public housing project after Green. He is a member of the Labor Hall of Fame.
