It was written by all five members of the band: Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Tony Kaye and Bill Bruford. The song was also released as a single in some continental European countries such as Italy and the Netherlands. In Italy the song was divided between the A-side and B-side. In the Netherlands it was released as a maxi single, backed with \\"Your Move\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\". The song has been a regular feature of Yes' live shows. It has also appeared on many live and compilation albums, including Yessongs, Classic Yes and Yesstory. The opening track off The Yes Album, \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" clocks in at nearly ten minutes. According to Allmusic critic Dave Thompson, the length and complexity of \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" was tester for Yes' lengthy songs over their next few albums, most notably \\"And You and I,\\" although he states that \\"at the time of release, however, it was unique ‚Äì and, listened to in isolation today, it remains so.\\" Lyrics According to Edward Macan, \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" \\"is generally recognized as Yes' first antiwar song\\" (though \\"Harold Land\\" from their debut album deals with the subject of war). Anderson has stated that the theme of the song was recognition that the kids fighting the war had no choice but to fight and that the war wasn't their fault. Author Bill Martin describes \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" as \\"a remarkable and subtle song about the Vietnam War.\\" The lyrics make their point by contrasting the suffering of the soldiers in Vietnam with people partying in Las Vegas. Thompson praises the line \\"On a sailing ship to nowhere\\" as \\"[conjuring] a mental image that the music cannot help but echo.\\" The original words \\"armies gather near\\" (confirmed in every recorded live version) have been misprinted as \\"armies scatter the earth\\" numerous times, suggesting this may have been a mis-transcription in the first published version, as the album cover itself did not include lyrics. However, this does not appear to have impacted the overall anti-war interpretation of the song. Composition The song begins with a staccato introduction, which builds tension right away. This is followed by Howe's guitar riffs, which have been described by various critics as both joyous and menacing. Author Dave Simonelli remarks that the \\"jagged but simple related pattern of chords\\" that Howe plays are developed in a manner analogous to a symphony. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau also praises Howe's playing on the song. Howe has stated that his guitar solo on the song is one of his favorites because it was the first time he was able to overdub his parts in that manner. Tony Kaye was against idea to use any kind of synthesizers out of studio, so early live videos shows no Moog, and Jon Anderson was forced to handle Kaye's parts on the Dewtron \\"Mister Bassman\\" bass pedal synthesizer. Later, when Rick Wakeman joined the band, he took over main riff on MiniMoog during live performances. According to Yes biographer Chris Welch, the vocals by Anderson and Squire \\"exude a sense of optimism as if all past battles are finally over and nothing can now stop the band's musical odyssey.\\" Personnel Band *Jon Andersonlead vocals, percussion *Chris Squirebass guitar, backing vocals *Steve Howeelectric & acoustic guitars, backing vocals *Tony KayeHammond organ, Moog *Bill Bruforddrums, percussion ReferencesBibliography *Dimery, Robert 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die New York: Quintet Publishing Limited, 2005. *Covach, John Rudolph and Boone, Graeme MacDonald Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis New York: Oxford University Press, 1997.

Personal life He was born in Overhalla as a son of district stipendiary magistrate Job Dischington B√∏dtker (1818-1889) and his wife Fredrikke Sophie Sejersted (1825-1872). He was the brother of military officer Carl Fredrik Johannes B√∏dtker and County Governor Eivind B√∏dtker, a second cousin of theatre critic Sigurd B√∏dtker and chemist Eyvind B√∏dtker and an uncle of banker and art collector Johannes Sejersted B√∏dtker and radio personality Carl B√∏dtker. In November 1887 he married Inger Marie Soot (1858‚Äì1939), a daughter of another log driving inspector. Career The family moved to T√∏nsberg in 1861, and despite ill health he graduated from middle school. He then attended Trondhjem Technical School between 1878 and 1881. He worked as a road engineer from 1882 to 1883, and with mapping from 1883 to 1889. From 1890 to 1932 he was the director of log driving in the Halden Watershed. Several dams and canals were constructed during his period; the lakes Setten, R√∏denessj√∏en, Femsj√∏en (twice), √ògderen, Ertevann, √òymarksj√∏en, Aspern and Ara were regulated. In 1907 the Tista Canal was finished. He was also a member of the executive committee of Halden municipal council. In 1932 he retired, and took on writing the history of log driving in Norway.

Background In 1839, during Poe's lifetime, a collection of his strange tales was published, but it did not include some highly regarded tales which were written later, including \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" and \\"A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\". The first posthumous collection of Poe's works was compiled in 1850 and included a memoir from Rufus Wilmot Griswold, but this did not confine itself to his tales of suspense and related tales. Several collections of Poe's prose and poetry followed. The precursor to Tales of Mystery and Imagination was a collection of Poe's works entitled Tales of Mystery, Imagination and Humor. The title \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" was first used by \\"The World's Classics\\", London, and printed by Grant Richard, 48 Leicester Sq. in 1902. The title of this collection was then adopted by Padraic Colum in 1908 in view of the growing reputation of Poe's taste for suspense, especially in the context of what his French critic M. Brunetiere called events \\"on the margin\\" of life. The original collection, in keeping with its title, deliberately excluded Poe's poems, comedies and essays. In his introduction to the 1908 edition Colum cites a reason for his adoption of this selection: his opinion that \\"tales\\" as opposed to \\"short stories\\" were so short that they tended to lack descriptions of socially important experiences. Colum hence also left out two works as too lengthy, these being The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and \\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall\\". Colum's 1908 collection of Poe's tales was published as a book specifically aimed at the general reading public by the influential publishing house of Geoffrey Newnes Ltd. using its Home Library Book Company, as part of \\"John O'London's\\" Home Library. Further development The 1908 version of Tales of Mystery and Imagination has been reproduced many times since under this same title by several publishers across the world for over 100 years, and Colum's selection of tales forms the backbone of subsequent versions under this same name. Everyman's Library produced their own copies of the 1908 version for several decades. The title of the 1908 book together with its formula of compiling Poe's most bewildering tales into a single volume continues to be used by other publishers. In 1919 London's George G. Harrap and Co. published an edition illustrated by Harry Clarke in black and white. In 1923 an expanded edition was released with many more illustrations, including eight color plates. In 1935 the artist Arthur Rackham produced another illustrated version of Tales of Mystery and Imagination. A musical album entitled Tales of Mystery and Imagination by The Alan Parsons Project uses the same title. It contains tracks based on three of these tales and several others, including poetry, with some narration by Orson Welles. Alan Parsons Project also used the title \\"The Gold Bug\\" for a track on their The Turn of a Friendly Card album. The title, and Poe himself, are also mentioned in the Van Morrison song \\"Fair Play\\" from the album Veedon Fleece.

Local tradition claims it was named after Samuel, one of the Crusaders who established the village. Under Mamluk rule in the 13th-15th centuries, it was referred to as Barakat al-Khalil (\\"the blessing of Abraham\\"), because its tax revenues were used by the sultan Barquq to endow the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.Pringle, 1997, p. 97 =Ottoman period= Summil was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in the 1596 tax records it was part of nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza under the Gaza Sanjak, with a population of 66 Muslim household, an estimated 363 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, fruit, beehives, and goats; a total of 14,500 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 151. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 137 When Edward Robinson visited Summil in the 1838, he noted that it was a \\"considerable village on an elevation of the plain.\\" He noticed a public well over deep and in diameter. He said that there was a \\"portion of an ancient wall apparently once belonging to a castle.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 368, also quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 137 It was also noted as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 118 In 1863, French explorer Victor Gu√©rin found the village, which he called Soummeil el-Khalil, to have 400 inhabitants. Some of the houses were built of stone, other of adobe. He further noted a waly, dedicated to a Sheikh Abdallah, which was a well built enclosure built of large stones.Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 121-122 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 indicated 50 houses and a population of 133, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 161Hartmann, 1883, p. 133 noted 49 houses In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Summeil as \\"a small village on the edge of the higher ground, of mud and stone, with cactus hedges. A pond on the south and a well on the north supply the place. Near the latter there is a pointed archway of good masonry, apparently medi√¶val work, and there are foundations of hewn stones in the village.

During this offensive, Israeli forces managed to occupy a broad swath of territory south of the Jerusalem- Ramla road, displacing over 20,000 people. Although Israeli military accounts later claimed that the inhabitants fled with the approach of Israeli columns, the Haganah spoke of \\"several cleaning operations\\" with Summil being one of the villages mentioned. Its inhabitants fled east toward the Hebron area. On July 19, 1948, an IDF patrol clashed with armed infiltrators at Summil, killing one and wounding another.

Britain Toy Company. Fred Whisstock was born in 1878 in Bow, East London. He moved to Southend in 1887, and was encouraged in his painting by George Reed, the headmaster of London Road Schools. He won several scholarships to attend the Royal College of Arts (South Kensington) and also won the Queens's prize for Model Drawing. After two years as a teacher, he joined Waterlow and Sons, the London printers and for the following three years he designed postage stamps for Ecuador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and New Zealand. Around 1903 he became a freelance artist and many of the watercolours in circulation, date from around this time (right). He worked with the poster artist Charles Dawson and later shared a studio in Jessle Chambers with the famous engraver J.A.C. Harrison. During this period he drew three caricatures (signed under the pseudonym Quip) that were published in Vanity fair. He continued to design book plates and, furthermore, designed a set of stamps for Liberia for Perkins Bacon. His cartoons (always signed Quip) were regularly published in newspapers and periodicals. During the 1914-18 war, Whisstock served in the Home Guard as a Lance-corporal. In the early 20th Century and up until 1930, Whisstock was employed by Britain's to design the box labels in a single style for their lead toy soldiers series.

The battle, a victory for the C√≥rdobans, was part of the \\"campaign of Muez\\" (campa√±a de Muez), which was directed primarily against Le√≥n's southern line of defence, the county of Castile along the Duero river. The earliest reference to the battle is found in the Chronicon of Sampiro, a Leonese cleric writing probably in the late 980s. According to Sampiro, the \\"Agarenes\\" (descendants of Hagar, i.e. the Muslims) arrived at Mois (Muez), threatening the kingdom of Navarre, whose king, Sancho Garc√©s I requested the aid of Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n. The Leonese king encountered the Muslims‚Äîwhom we know from other sources to have been under the command of their emir, ‚ÄòAbdarrahmƒÅn III‚Äîin the Valdejunquera and was routed. Two of his bishops, Dulcidio and Ermogio, were taken captive to C√≥rdoba. In exchange for his uncle's freedom, Ermogio's nephew Pelagius, later a martyr, went into captivity instead, while Ordo√±o ransomed Dulcidio. As a further result of the battle, the fortified site of Clunia, which had been repopulated by the Castilian count Gonzalo Fern√°ndez in 912, had to be abandoned. It was in Muslim hands as late as 1007‚Äì10.Bishko 1984, 354. The exact location of Valdejunquera is unknown. The seventeenth-century Navarrese historian Jos√© de Moret located it north of Irujo and south of the sierra of And√≠a.Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, 254, accepts this location. He claimed that even in his day the Basques called the region \\"Iuncadia\\" in their language. The late eleventh-century Historia Silense placed the battle in the territory of Sancho Garc√©s, somewhere between Estella and Pamplona.Bishko 1948, 560. The assignment of the bishops Dulcidio and Ermogio to known dioceses has also been problematic. While Sampiro's continuator, Pelayo of Oviedo, writing in the twelfth century, believed them to be bishops of Salamanca and Tuy, respectively, neither is possible. In 920 the see of Salamanca lay in the depopulated \\"Desert of the Duero\\" and that of Tuy had as its bishop a certain Nausto. In studying the texts of Sampiro and Pelayo, historian Justo P√©rez de Urbel concluded that Dulcidio was Bishop of Zamora and Ermogio of Oporto, but with roots in the region of Tuy.

It holds that First Nations children should not be denied access to public services while governments fight over who should pay. In order to ensure substantive equality, this can also include services that are not ordinarily available to other children. According to the First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada, the organization that hosts the Jordan's Principle campaign: > Jordan‚Äôs Principle ensures that First Nations children can access all public > services when they need them. Services need to be culturally-based and take > into full account the historical disadvantage linked to colonization that > many First Nations children live with. The government of first contact pays > for the service and resolves jurisdictional/payment disputes later. Jordan's Principle is reflective of the non-discrimination provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Canadian domestic law that does not allow differential treatment on the basis of race or ethnic origin. History  Jordan's Principle was established by First Nations in response to the death of five-year-old Jordan River Anderson, a child from Norway House Cree Nation who suffered from Carey Fineman Ziter syndrome, a rare muscular disorder that required years of medical treatment in a Winnipeg hospital. After spending the first two years of his life in a hospital, doctors cleared Jordan to live in a family home near the hospital in Winnipeg. However, the federal and provincial governments could not resolve who was financially responsible for the necessary home care. For over two years, the Government of Canada and Manitoba provincial government continued to argue while Jordan remained in the hospital. In 2005, at the age of five, Jordan died in the hospital; he never had the opportunity to live in a family home. In 2005, the First Nations Child & Family Caring Society released the Wen:De: We are Coming to the Light of Day report. Drawing on a team of over twenty researchers, the report provides a holistic and detailed review of the Government of Canada's First Nations child and family services policy and sets out recommendations for improvement. The research found that jurisdictional disputes continue to have significant impacts on the lived experiences of First Nations children, particularly those with special needs. Among the policy recommendations, the report recommended that Jordan's Principle be adopted by the Government of Canada and provincial/territorial governments. Private Members Motion 296 in support of Jordan's Principle was passed unanimously in the House of Commons of Canada on December 12, 2007. In February 2015, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) released the Jordan's Principle Working Group report named Without denial, delay or disruption: Ensuring First Nations children‚Äôs access to equitable services through Jordan‚Äôs Principle, highlighting several gaps in Jordan‚Äôs Principle implementation. In June 2015, the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission made Jordan's Principle the third of its 94 Calls to Action for governments in Canada, stating, \\"We call upon all levels of government to fully implement Jordan‚Äôs Principle.\\" In November 2018, the Alberta provincial government signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Jordan‚Äôs Principle with the First Nations Health Consortium and the federal government. In June 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Calls for Justice 12.10 calls for the federal and provincial/territorial governments to immediately implement Jordan's Principle for all First Nations (Status and non-Status) children.  Canadian human rights case  In January 2016, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, a Canadian legal institution with a mandate to adjudicate cases where there has been an alleged breach of the Canadian Human Rights Act, found that the Government of Canada's improper implementation of Jordan's Principle resulted in discrimination against First Nations children and youth on the basis of race and national ethnic origin and ordered the Government of Canada to \\"cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan‚Äôs Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan‚Äôs Principle.\\" Since January 2016, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has issued nine remedial non- compliance orders against Canada for failing to abide by the original decision and implement the proper definition of Jordan's Principle.The fourth non- compliance order was issued in May 2017 after the Tribunal found that the Government of Canada continued to repeat \\"its pattern of conduct and narrow focus with respect to Jordan‚Äôs Principle.\\" Twenty-two additional legal orders in regards to Jordan's Principle were made at this time. The fifth non- compliance order was issued by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in November 2017 to provide amended orders to the May 2017 order. Per the non-compliance order, the Tribunal ordered the federal government to: * Apply Jordan's Principle to all First Nations children under local age of majority living on and off reserve; * Apply Jordan's Principle based on the needs of the child, not just what is typically available to other children (normative standard of care); and * Ensure that administrative procedures do not delay service provision. Jordan's Principle Information Poster June 29, 2018 The Tribunal also ordered the federal government to follow specific timeframes when making a determination on a request: * Individual cases: * Urgent: within 12 hours * Non-urgent: within 48 hours * Group cases: * Urgent: within 48 hours * Non- urgent: within 1 week The seventh non-compliance order, an interim relief order, was issued in February 2019. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ordered the federal government to provide non-status First Nations children who are recognized members of their First Nation and who have urgent or life- threatening needs services under Jordan's Principle. The interim ruling on the eligibility of First Nations children for Jordan's Principle was issued until the Tribunal could provide a further order. In July 2020, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal issued a ruling following the interim relief order on the eligibility of First Nations children with regard to receiving services through Jordan's Principle. The Canadian government has been ordered to immediately consider First Nations children who will become eligible for Indian Act status under S-3 implementation eligible for services through Jordan's Principle. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found two other categories of First Nations children who will be eligible for Jordan's Principle in the future following a further order from the Tribunal. This includes First Nations children without Indian Act status who are recognized as citizens or members of their respective First Nations, as well as First Nations children who do not have Indian Act status who are not eligible for Indian Act status, but have a parent/guardian with, or who is eligible for, Indian Act status. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal issued a ninth non- compliance order in September 2019. The Tribunal ruled that First Nations children and their families would receive the maximum compensation through the Canadian Human Rights Act ($40,000) for Canada's \\"wilful and reckless\\" discrimination, referring to it as a worst-case scenario under the Act. Canada has been ordered to compensate certain First Nations children, and their parents or grandparents, who were affected by the discriminatory treatment in child welfare services since January 1, 2006 or were denied or experienced delays in services covered under Jordan's Principle since November 2, 2017. The Government of Canada submitted a judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal compensation order to the Federal Court in October 2019. Canada was seeking an order to quash all financial compensation and a motion to stay the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal proceedings until the Federal Court makes a decision on the judicial review. Hearings were held in November 2019 and Canada's stay motion was denied soon after. Alanis Obomsawin's 2016 documentary film We Can't Make the Same Mistake Twice argues that the federal government has fought applying Jordan's Principle to such a degree that an $11-million fund set aside to cover its costs was never used. Anderson was also the subject of Obomsawin's 2019 film Jordan River Anderson, the Messenger.Peter Howell, \\"Indigenous films highlight Canadian slate at TIFF 2019\\". Toronto Star, July 31, 2019.  Jurisdictional disputes  In Canada, there is a lack of clarity between the federal and provincial/territorial governments around who should pay for government services for First Nations children even when the service is normally available to other children. Too often the practice is for the governments to deny or delay the child's receipt of services pending resolution of the payment dispute. Under Jordan's Principle, where a jurisdictional dispute arises between two government parties (provincial/territorial or federal) or between two departments or ministries of the same government, regarding payment for services for a First Nations child, the government or ministry/department of first contact must pay for the services without delay or disruption. The paying government party can refer the matter to jurisdictional dispute mechanisms after the service or support has been provided.Blackstock, C. \\"Jordan's principle: Editorial update\\". Paediatr Child Health. 13: 589‚Äì90. PMC 2603509 . PMID 19436554. A jurisdictional dispute is not always necessary for the application of Jordan's Principle.

Hulteen, 556 U.S. 701 (2009), is a US labor law case of the United States Supreme Court, holding that maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act needed not to be considered in calculating employee pension benefits. Facts The case entered the Supreme Court's docket in October 2007 and concerned whether maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act can be considered in calculating employee pension benefits. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in June 2008. The case concerns Noreen Hulteen who took maternity leave in 1968. Due to complications resulting from giving birth she was hospitalized and required surgery. She missed a total of 240 days of work due to her pregnancy and surgery, but her employer, AT&T; Corporation, only gave her 30 days of paid leave. Under company policy at the time, in contrast, employees who took disability leave were entitled to be paid as long as they were disabled. Before the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, it was lawful to award less service credit for pregnancy leave and exclude conditions related to pregnancy from employee sickness and accident benefits plans. The Supreme Court had previously upheld this in the cases of General Electric Company v. Gilbert (1976) and Geduldig v. Aiello (1974).http://www.answers.com/topic/general-electric-company-v-gilbert As a result of the policy, when Hulteen retired in 1994 from AT&T;, AT&T; calculated her pension benefits by excluding 210 days that it would have credited if she had been granted leave because of any disability other than pregnancy. Shortly after her retirement, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union for the majority of AT&T;'s nonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. In 1998 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), agreed with the CWA, alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII and issued a Letter of Determination finding reasonable cause to believe that AT&T; had discriminated Hulteen and several other women. In 2001, Hulteen and several other women sued AT&T;, stating its decision to pay them smaller pensions because of their pregnancy disability leaves constituted an unlawful employment practice under the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and allows those on maternity leave the same coverage as other medical leave.http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-543 Lawyers for the women argued that each reduced retirement check that they receive is \\"a fresh act of discrimination\\" a reference to the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama the Lilly Ledbetter law. AT&T;'s argument was that the 1978 law cannot be applied retroactively because congress did not make the law retroactive and that they were basing the pension calculations on conditions at the time of employment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in hearing the case ruled in favor of Hulteen. This decision directly conflicted with previous decisions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, helping to lead to the Supreme Courts decision to review the case. Oral arguments were heard on December 10, 2008. Judgment The Supreme Court ruled in a 7‚Äì2 decision on May 18, 2009 that maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act could be excluded in calculating employee pension benefits, even though leave taken for non-pregnancy related medical disabilities was not excluded.. As a result of the Court's opinion AT&T; was not required to amend its discriminatory pension policy retroactive to the effective date of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Justice Souter, in the majority opinion, wrote the following. Justice Ginsburg dissented and said the following. Significance Critics of the decision like Christine L. Owens of the National Employment Law Project stated that \\"The court's decision could affect thousands of women who took pregnancy leaves decades ago and now are headed toward retirement; the only way women who took pregnancy leave before 1979 can make their leave time count is through the good graces of their company or through legislation by Congress.\\" Proponents of the decision like Rae T. Vann of Equal Employment Advisory Council stated that the decision was a \\"sensible and straightforward ruling\\" and \\"Congress intended the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to be applied prospectively, not retroactively.\\"  See also  *US labor law * Pregnancy discrimination NotesExternal links  Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States family case law Category:United States labor case law Category:2009 in United States case law Category:Communications Workers of America Category:AT&T; litigation Category:Parental leave in the United States ","title":"AT&amp;T Corp. v.

It also provides the strategic logistics link from the national industrial base to the joint Warfighter in the field. The 401st AFSB now commands four Army Field Support Battalions (AFSBn), operating in Afghanistan, Qatar, Kuwait and Iraq, sustaining the warfighter throughout the entire CENTCOM area of responsibility. The 401st AFSB provides its headquarters, the Army Sustainment Command (ASC), and the Materiel Enterprise partners a forward presence and executes critical programs and missions in support of Operation Freedom‚Äôs Sentinel in Afghanistan. These include building and sustaining the CENTCOM joint Warfighter; providing property accountability; enhancing CENTCOM readiness, and providing strategic depth. The 401st AFSB also manages the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) to provide essential combat support and combat service support tailored to requirements identified by battlespace commanders. It is also involved in contracted field support maintenance; the Logistics Assistance Program; Theater Property Equipment; Army Preposition Stocks-5; support to Foreign Military Sales; and Life Cycle Management Command reach back support.  History  The 401st traces its history back to the 1997 activation of the Combat Equipment Group-Southwest Asia (CEG-SWA). The command was formed as a result of the chief of staff of the Army‚Äôs decision to expand AMC‚Äôs responsibility for war reserve stocks to include the Persian Gulf region. While the unit created Army prepositioned stock sets in Qatar and Kuwait, it underwent a series of name and organizational changes. CEG-SWA was renamed AMC ForwardSWA on Oct. 1, 2000, when the unit assumed responsibility for the LAP (Logistics Assistance Program) and LOGCAP in Southwest Asia. AMC Forward began war support operations in Southwest Asia in October 2001, when it began to support U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The headquarters moved from Qatar to Kuwait in the fall of 2002 as part of the ramp up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit was re- designated the Army Field Support Brigade-SWA on Oct. 1, 2004. At the time, the AFSB-SWA consisted of the Brigade Headquarters in Qatar; Army Field Support Battalion-Qatar; AFSBn-Kuwait; AFSBn-Afghanistan; prepositioned watercraft at Kuwait Naval Base; and the Logistics Support Element at Arifjan, Kuwait. The AFSB-SWA was deactivated on Oct. 16, 2006, when the 401st AFSB was activated. In 2008, brigade headquarters forward-deployed to Bagram Airfield. The battalions in Kuwait and Qatar transferred to the 402nd AFSB in 2010 to allow the 401st to focus on Afghanistan. In 2015 the 401st full moved their headquarters to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait and reintegrated the AFSBn's from Kuwait and Qatar back into their command. The 402nd AFSB then redeployed back to Hawaii.

Kept in Germanisches Nationalmuseum, this is the so-called \\"Henlein-Uhr\\", and its association with Henlein's workshop, and even its authenticity, has long been controversial. The 1505 pomander watch A Nuremberg egg (German: N√ºrnberger Ei) is a type of small ornamental spring-driven clock made to be worn around the neck, produced in Nuremberg in the mid-to-late 16th century. Their production was made possible by the miniaturisation of the torsion pendulum and coil spring mechanism by Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (d. 1542) at the beginning of the 16th century (c. 1505-10). These portable watches were a novelty (although the oldest portable watch driven by wound-up clockwork rather than by weights dates to c. 1430, the so-called watch of Philip the Good), and their accuracy was very limited, so that they only had a single hand, showing hours. There are three types of clock-watches made in early 16th-century Nuremberg: * High cylindrical drum-watches (Dosenuhr) to be used as table clocks or to be carried in a purse * Flat cylindrical drum-watches (Dosenuhr) to be worn around the neck on a cord or necklace * Spherical watches in small pomanders (Bisamapfeluhr) that were worn on the wrist or around the neck The actual \\"eggs\\" (Eierlein) are a type of oval (\\"egg-shaped\\") form of the Dosenuhr which became popular from around 1580. Although they are associated with Henlein, and are a development of the watch-making tradition of Henlein's time, they thus become popular only several decades after his death. The German name Eierlein \\"little egg\\" is a corruption of a diminutive of Uhr (Middle Low German √ªr, from Latin hora) \\"clock\\", Aeurlein or Ueurlein (Modern German √úhrlein). The association with \\"eggs\\" may arise with a 1571 translation of Rabelais by Johann Fischart in 1571; Fischart translated as Eierlein an instance of Ueurlein in Rabelais. This form of the name may have played a part in inspiring the oval shape becoming popular in the 1580s.. It is known that Henlein first succeeded in producing a portable clock in 1510, and his contributions were clearly instrumental in giving rise to the later Nuremberg \\"neck-watch\\" industry. He is recorded to have sold a \\"gilded Pomander for all purposes with a clock-mechanism\\" (vergulten pysn Apffel f√ºr all Ding mit einem Oraiologium, i.e. a clock built into a precious perfume-box) for 15 gulden to the city on 11 January 1524. Of the \\"pomander watch\\" type (Bisamapfeluhr), only two specimens are known to survive, one dated to 1505 and attributed to Henlein, the other dated 1530 (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore).

As a result of winning the contest, she played Maria, the lead, in the Toronto revival of The Sound of Music from October 2008 through January 2010. She went on to star as Sherrie in Mirvish Productions' Rock of Ages at Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre from April 2010 through January 2011 and on the first U.S. tour. She appeared as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, Ross Petty Productions' 2011 pantomime at Toronto's Elgin Theatre from November 2011 through January 2012. MacKenzie is currently represented by Toronto agency The Talent House and Carrier Talent Management in Vancouver. Biography MacKenzie was born in Moncton, New Brunswick. A self-described tomboy growing up in Surrey, British Columbia, she participated in children's choirs and various singing competitions. Her first job was at age 15, at De Dutch Pannekoek House in Vancouver. At age 16 she auditioned for Canadian Idol but was passed over because she sounded \\"too musical theatre\\". She graduated in 2008 from the musical theatre program at Capilano College, and had major roles in productions such as High School Musical in North Vancouver in 2007, in which she portrayed Gabriella . She was about to take a part in a community theatre production of Cinderella, as a wicked stepsister, and was also considering a career in massage therapy, when her uncle noticed the audition call for the CBC show. On How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? after thousands of people auditioned in early 2008, she competed against 47 other finalists, who were eliminated by a combination of judges' decisions and viewer voting, although once the final two were selected, the winner was chosen only by fans. She beat out Janna Polzin of Woodstock, Ontario, who was widely expected to win. Composer and judge Andrew Lloyd Webber referred to MacKenzie as \\"the dark horse\\" of the competition. The role of Maria was her first professional acting credit. Reviews of the Toronto show weren almost uniformly positive, and the show's success, despite the recession, was credited largely to MacKenzie. She played the role of Sherrie Christian in the Toronto production of the musical Rock of Ages and on the first U.S. tour.

Early and personal life He was born at Oscarsborg Fortress as a son of Major General Carl Fredrik Johannes B√∏dtker (1851‚Äì1928) and Karen Agathe Falck (1852‚Äì1932). He was the brother of banker and art collector Johannes Sejersted B√∏dtker, a nephew of log driving manager Ragnvald B√∏dtker and County Governor Eivind B√∏dtker and a second cousin of theatre critic Sigurd B√∏dtker and chemist Eyvind B√∏dtker. B√∏dtker first followed in his father's footsteps, taking education as a machine engineer at Kristiania Technical School in 1906. In 1906 he was hired as controller at a cannon factory in D√ºsseldorf; from 1911 he worked at a steel works in the same city. He met his future wife, Anita Emily M√∂hlau (1889‚Äì1979) here and married her in 1914. In the same year he returned to Norway, and was hired at Norsk Hydro Rjukan. Media career An avid amateur radio operator, B√∏dtker participated in the early broadcasting in Norway. The first radio program aired in December 1924, and B√∏dtker was the presenter. He especially became known as the host of the popular children's program L√∏rdagsbarnetimen; in this program he was nicknamed \\"Uncle B√∏dtker\\". He lost his job at Norsk Hydro due to downsizing around 1925, and then became a board member of Kringkastingselskapet from 1925 to 1930. In 1933 the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation was established. In 1940 Norway was invaded and subsequently occupied by Nazi Germany as a part of World War II. The Nazi occupants soon moved to cease normal activity at the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. In September 1940 the corporation was taken over by the newly created Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Enlightenment. As a part of a broader nazification strategy, the directors were replaced, and B√∏dtker agreed to assume the position as director of administration. He was one of four sub-directors under commissary president Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, who in turn answered to the Minister of Culture and Enlightenment. Christie struggled with intrigues both internally and in relation to the Reichskommissariat Norwegen. B√∏dtker saw his opportunity and \\"neglected\\" Christie in daily affairs. He also enrolled in the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling to strengthen his position. Christie answered with scrutiny of B√∏dtker's economic affairs, and found some exaggerated costs for rent of cars, hotel rooms et cetera. This was enough to have B√∏dtker, who lacked a human network in Nasjonal Samling, fired in June 1941. At the same time he left the party. However, he was asked to return in October 1942, with Christie long gone. By that time the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation had experienced severe hardships, as most of the listeners abruptly disappeared: radios had become prohibited in the autumn 1941 for everybody save members of Nasjonal Samling.Dahl, 1991: p. 202 B√∏dtker remained in his position until Victory in Europe Day, when the Nazi regime fell; he was arrested shortly thereafter. As a part of the legal purge he was sentenced for Nazi collaboration. However, after a while it became clear that he had worked to help the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation through a difficult time, and tried to resist Nazi German attempts of monetary exploitation of the company. Also his brother Johannes was imprisoned during the last years of the war. Nonetheless B√∏dtker maintained a low profile for the rest of his life and died in February 1980 in √Ödal.

(2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. For example, suppose our interest is in the mean number of months that people with a particular type of cancer remain in remission following successful treatment with chemotherapy. The confidence interval aims to contain the unknown mean remission duration with a given probability. This is the \\"confidence level\\" or \\"confidence coefficient\\" of the constructed interval which is effectively the \\"nominal coverage probability\\" of the procedure for constructing confidence intervals. The \\"nominal coverage probability\\" is often set at 0.95. The coverage probability is the actual probability that the interval contains the true mean remission duration in this example. If all assumptions used in deriving a confidence interval are met, the nominal coverage probability will equal the coverage probability (termed \\"true\\" or \\"actual\\" coverage probability for emphasis). If any assumptions are not met, the actual coverage probability could either be less than or greater than the nominal coverage probability. When the actual coverage probability is greater than the nominal coverage probability, the interval is termed \\"conservative\\", if it is less than the nominal coverage probability, the interval is termed \\"anti-conservative\\", or \\"permissive.\\" A discrepancy between the coverage probability and the nominal coverage probability frequently occurs when approximating a discrete distribution with a continuous one. The construction of binomial confidence intervals is a classic example where coverage probabilities rarely equal nominal levels. For the binomial case, several techniques for constructing intervals have been created. The Wilson or Score confidence interval is one well known construction based on the normal distribution. Other constructions include the Wald, exact, Agresti-Coull, and likelihood intervals. While the Wilson interval may not be the most conservative estimate, it produces average coverage probabilities that are equal to nominal levels while still producing a comparatively narrow confidence interval. The \\"probability\\" in coverage probability is interpreted with respect to a set of hypothetical repetitions of the entire data collection and analysis procedure. In these hypothetical repetitions, independent data sets following the same probability distribution as the actual data are considered, and a confidence interval is computed from each of these data sets; see Neyman construction. The coverage probability is the fraction of these computed confidence intervals that include the desired but unobservable parameter value.

Fifty-one were built, of which the Germans seized twenty- four when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks captured eighteen when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Romania acquired nine when Czech troops sought refuge in Romania after the Hungarian invasion of Carpatho-Ukraine that same month. Slovak vehicles saw combat in the Slovak-Hungarian War, the invasion of Poland, the opening months of Operation Barbarossa and the Slovak National Uprising.  Description  The OA vz. 30's armored body was mounted on a Tatra 6 √ó 4 T-72 truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual as it was a central tube design with independently sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ZB vz. 26 light machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door in the rear of the vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360¬∞ of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ZB vz. 26 in a ball mount. Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over distance.Kliment and Francev, pp. 28‚Äì30 The , air-cooled, , four-cylinder boxer Tatra 71 engine was mounted in the front. It gave a top speed of . The vehicle could cross a ditch wide, climb an obstacle high and ford a stream deep.Kliment and Francev, p. 275  Development  The development history for the OA vz. 30 is difficult to sort out, but the Czech Army had been evaluating various Tatra truck chassis for use as armored cars since 1926 with a number of prototypes built over the years with both wooden and metal bodies to test vehicle layouts. An order was finally placed on 6 March 1933 for fifty-one for delivery in December. Tatra was late and only delivered the first six on 29 January 1934 followed by sixteen more in February and the rest in July because their garages in Milovice were not yet complete.Kliment and Francev, pp. 29‚Äì31  Operational history  Replica of OA vz. 30 =Czechoslovakia= In service they proved to have some serious shortcomings. The engines were weak and did not allow the vehicle to fully exploit the abilities of the chassis, not even being able to cross the ditches at the sides of roads. The armor was thin and could be penetrated at close range by rifles and the ZB vz. 26 machine guns were not capable of sustained fire.Kliment and Francev, p. 31 The Army decided to organize them in three-vehicle platoons assigned to the reconnaissance companies of the four Mobile (Rychl√°) Divisions and assigned the extra platoons to support the border areas. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938. After the Munich Agreement two companies of OA vz. 30s were sent to reinforce Slovakia and Ruthenia where they were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.Kliment and Francev, pp. 31‚Äì33 Ten armored cars, no longer needed once that the border areas had been annexed by Germany and Hungary, were sold to the Gendarmerie in February‚ÄîMarch 1939. Two companies defended Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939 from a Hungarian attack, but were forced to seek refuge in Slovakia and Romania. One OA vz. 30 was captured by the Hungarians during the fighting, but they made no known use of it.Kliment and Francev, p. 32 =Germany= The Germans captured one OA vz. 30 in October 1938 that was being repaired in the Sudetenland when they occupied that area. Another twenty-three, including the prototype, were seized in March 1939 when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia. Seven were used by the propaganda companies as radio cars.Kliment and Francev, p. 33 Ten were taken over by the Uniformed Police (Ordnungspolizei) and three equipped a platoon of the 14th Armored Police Company (Polizei-Panzer-Kompanie) in Slovenia in January 1944. =Slovakia= Ten armored cars were seized by the Slovaks when they declared independence in March 1939, but eight additional OA vz. 30s fell into their hands when Czech troops were sought refuge in Slovakia after fighting the Hungarians in Carpatho-Ukraine. One was destroyed during the Slovak-Hungarian War that began a week later. The seventeen surviving OA vz. 30s formed one company in the Armored Battalion \\"Martin\\" formed by the Slovak Army in mid-1939, but that was reduced to a platoon by late 1939.Kliment and Nakl√°dal, pp. 36‚Äì37 Four armored cars reinforced the 2nd Infantry Division during the invasion of Poland and three others reinforced a cavalry reconnaissance unit in the vicinity of Sanok. A company of six OA vz. 30s was part of Mobile Group Kalinƒçiak that was formed on 5 September to work with the 2nd Infantry Division, but saw no combat before being withdrawn back to Slovakia on the 21st.Kliment and Nakl√°dal, pp. 62‚Äì64 A platoon of three was assigned to the Mobile Group that joined the Germans in Operation Barbarossa on 24 June 1941. Two more were added when the Mobile Group was reinforced and redesignated as the Mobile Brigade on 8 July. The only serious combat encountered by the Slovak armor was at Lipovec in late July where they failed to dislodge the Soviet 44th Mountain Rifle Division from its positions. One OA vz. 30 was destroyed during this battle and two others were heavily damaged. All of the armored cars were withdrawn together with all the other armored vehicles and returned to Slovakia in early August.Kliment and Nakl√°dal, pp. 71‚Äì72 A company of six OA vz. 30s was sent to reinforce the Security Division on anti-partisan duties in Ukraine in August 1942. Two were destroyed in combat and there was only one running when the survivors were withdrawn back to Slovakia on 12 January 1943. Once the Panzerkampfwagen IIs that the Ministry of Defense had ordered to replace them arrived in January 1944 they were put into storage although they were still carried on the books.Kliment and Nakl√°dal, pp. 43‚Äì46 They saw some use by the insurgents when the Slovak National Uprising began in September 1944, but little is known of their activities. = Romania = Almost nothing is known about the career of the OA vz. 30 in Romania after one Czech company of ten sought refuge there in March 1939. One unconfirmed report says that some were on the strength of the Romanian dictator Antonescu's bodyguard unit (Batalionul de gardƒÉ al mare≈üalului Antonescu or Regimentul de gardƒÉ al ConducƒÉtorului Statului). Supposedly three were destroyed during American bombing of Ploie≈üti in the summer of 1944 while being serviced at the depot there.Ronald L.

Drake struck \\"rock oil\\" there in 1859. Titusville and other towns on the shores of Oil Creek expanded rapidly as oil wells and refineries shot up across the region. Oil quickly became one of the most valuable commodities in the United States and railroads expanded into Western Pennsylvania to ship petroleum to the rest of the country. By the mid-1870s, the oil industry was well established, and the \\"rush\\" to drill wells and control production was over. Pennsylvania oil production peaked in 1891, and was later surpassed by western states such as Texas and California, but some oil industry remains in Pennsylvania. Pre-rush historyPre-Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company= Before petroleum was used as a fuel, oil had many uses. In Pennsylvania, the Native American tribes had been using oil from seeps for several centuries. Early European explorers discovered evidence of troughs dug alongside the creek where Native American tribes had collected oil for use as ointment, insect repellant, skin coloring and in religious ceremonies. These oil seeps, which are areas where oil spontaneously escapes the earth in gas or liquid form, were common across northern Pennsylvania. As the frontier expanded into Western Pennsylvania during the 18th century, the region became known for the oil beneath its surface, and maps of the era displayed the label ‚ÄúPetroleum.‚Äù With few uses for crude oil, the label served primarily to deter farmers who found the black soil inhospitable to their crops. Later, other uses became known. Crude oil began to be used as an alternative to whale oil for lamps, and inventors and scientists began to test oil for other uses, including energy. Kier's experiments with oil With petroleum seeps popping up across western Pennsylvania, it became difficult for other extractive industries, especially for salt water wells to extract salt. This business was popular in the area at the time but with oil from the seeps spilling into the wells, it became much more difficult. In 1849 Samuel Kier began extracting oil from the saltwater wells on his property. Upon further examination, Kier recognized that the medicinal oil being prescribed to his wife was the same in chemistry as the oil found in his wells. Kier sold his oil as a remedy and grew wealthy. Other uses for Kier's oil were explored. In the 1850s Kier began to drill for crude oil rather than separating it from salt water. After extracting the oil from drilling, Kier joined up with John T. Kirkpatrick to build the first refinery. Soon Kier and Kirkpatrick distilled oil that could be used for lighting. For years after, Kier improved the crude oil refining process to produce the cleanest and most efficient lighting oil. He called his oil ‚Äúcarbon oil.‚Äù To accompany his refined oil, Kier invented an oil-burning lamp that burned his oil with little bad odor or smoke. This could have been profitable to Kier, but he never patented his lamp. =The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company= News of Kier's experiments spread, and George Bissell, a lawyer from New York, learned of Kier's success. In 1854, Bissell commissioned a study from Yale chemist Benjamin Silliman, Jr. to assess the viability of harvesting oil in western Pennsylvania. After Silliman's results confirmed that the petroleum in the Oil Creek Valley could profitably be distilled into lamp oil, Bissell founded the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. The company was funded by businessmen and bankers from New Haven, Connecticut. Among the stockholders was banker James Townsend. In 1857 Bissell and Townsend hired Edwin Drake to travel to Titusville and drill for crude oil. Drake was an unemployed railroad conductor whose sole qualification for this job seems to have been a free railroad pass that allowed travel to Titusville. Drake secured some land and reported back that he believed the land was oil rich and the oil industry could be extremely profitable. In 1858, the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company became the Seneca Oil Company with Drake as president. =Drake strikes oil= Soon Drake began drilling for oil in Titusville, near the shores of Oil Creek, but at first met with little success. He used an old steam engine to drill. Many of his drilling sites only yielded trace amounts of oil. He and his assistant, blacksmith Billy Smith, endured fires, financial setbacks, and the ridicule of the local inhabitants. When the Seneca Oil Company gave up and decided to withdraw its funding, Drake obtained a personal line of credit to continue digging. On August 27, 1859, Drake struck oil at below ground, just before his funds ran out. This marked the beginning of drastic change for the people of Western Pennsylvania. His drilling is considered the \\"first large-scale commercial extraction of petroleum\\". Unfortunately for Drake, his success would not last. He had not purchased much land in the region, and the oil industry exploded around him outside of his control. His first well yielded only modest returns and he was fired by Seneca. He never patented the drilling method he pioneered, and lost his modest earnings from the oil business speculating on Wall Street. He would eventually die a poor pensioner in 1880. The rush Soon the area had many wells drilled by Seneca Oil Company and others. The oil boom in Pennsylvania paralleled in many ways the gold rush in California ten years earlier. It is reported that in the first year (1859), these wells produced . Boomtowns such as Titusville, Oil City and Pithole sprang up within years and an early chronicler of the region, Reverend S. J. M. Eaton, observed in 1866 that the Oil Creek Valley was so densely packed it was impossible to distinguish the borders where one town ended and another began. The Titusville population exploded from 250 residents to over 10,000 in little more than five years and in 1866 it incorporated as a city. Ironworks were erected to supply drilling tools and eight oil refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Pithole expanded from four log-cabin farmhouses to a bustling city with over 50 hotels over the span of five months in 1865. Annual domestic output of crude swelled from in 1859, the year of Drake's ‚Äúdiscovery,‚Äù to in 1869 and in 1873. The ongoing industrial development of Europe spurred this rapid expansion. European, and especially British, factories began importing large quantities of cheap American oil during the 1860s. By 1866, US petroleum exports far surpassed petroleum distributed to domestic markets and the value of these exports nearly doubled from $16 million in 1865 to $30 million in 1869. Petroleum jumped from the sixth most valuable US export to the second most valuable during this period. At the peak of the oil boom, Pennsylvania wells were producing one third of the world's oil. =Transportation= In the first years of the oil rush, high overland shipping costs drove many well owners to float their product down Oil Creek to the Allegheny River as lumber producers did. For decades, logs had been transported using man-made floods, known as pond freshets, created by successively breaking milldams along the length of the river. These freshets could carry up to 800 skiffs filled with crude oil downstream at once. Most skiffs held between of oil, but one third of that leaked out of the skiffs before they were even launched and another third was lost by the time the skiffs reached Pittsburgh. Only three in five of the flimsy vessels survived the trip without being destroyed by collisions with rocks, fallen trees, or other skiffs. In 1862 the Oil Creek Railroad Company completed a line that connected Titusville to the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad and the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in Corry, Pennsylvania. The new railroad brought more people into the Oil Creek Valley and provided a safer alternative to the freshets for transporting barrels of crude. The oil was carried from the wells to the railroad in horse-drawn wagons. In 1865 pipelines were laid from the oil fields directly to the rail line, ending horse-drawn transport. The following year, the Farmers Railroad extended the rail line 20 km south from Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania to Oil City. In February 1871, the Union City & Titusville Railroad (UC&T;), which was built to compete with the Oil Creek Railroad, was completed. The UC&T; became part of the larger Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in July 1871. =Consolidation and end of the boom= The rush to Pennsylvania created violent swings in the petroleum market for the first decade of the oil boom. In 1861, the proliferation of wells across the Oil Creek Valley pushed the price of oil down from $10 a barrel to 10 cents a barrel. In response, producers in the region formed the Oil Creek Association to restrict output and maintain a minimum price of $4 a barrel. Despite efforts such as this to control the petroleum market, the volatile boom-bust cycle continued into the early 1870s. By 1871, refining capacity had grown to over 12 million barrels per year, more than twice the amount of oil that was actually processed in that year. The first oil exchange in the US was established in Titusville in January 1872 in response to rumors that a conspiratorial ring of crude oil traders in New York City had cornered the market. As the decade progressed, larger producers, such as John D. Rockefeller‚Äôs Standard Oil, began to consolidate their holdings over the wells and refineries in the region, and the oil rush began to settle down. Pennsylvania oil production peaked in 1891, when the state produced 31 million barrels of oil, 58% of the nation's oil that year. But 1892 was the last year that Pennsylvania wells provided a majority of the oil produced in the US, and in 1895, Ohio surpassed Pennsylvania as an oil producer. By 1907, the decline of the Pennsylvania fields and the great discoveries made in Texas, California, and Oklahoma, left Pennsylvania with less than 10% of the nation's oil production.G.R. Hopkins and A.B Coons, \\"Crude petroleum and petroleum products, in Statistical Appendix to the Minerals Yearbook, 1932‚Äì33, US Bureau of Mines, 1934, p.306. By 1901, the Pennsylvania oil boom was over. The formation of the Standard Oil Trust in 1882 effectively established a monopoly over the industry in Pennsylvania, and the discovery of oil in Texas, California and Wyoming shifted the nation's attention elsewhere. Pennsylvania continued to be a significant producer of petroleum for much of the 20th century, but the Oil Creek Valley had been permanently eclipsed.

There is some controversy about the details of her life story, and if she actually authored any penny dreadfuls. Biography Commenting on her literary reputation in 1859, American critic Samuel Austin Allibone said Grey \\"has fairly earned a title to be ranked as one of the most popular novelists of the day.\\" That reputation has not lasted, her life and body of work today are fairly obscure outside of a few specialised fields of study such as Victorian literature and vampire literature. Grey is probably most often remembered today as being the first woman to write and publish a vampire story; one of her earliest stories, The Skeleton Count, or The Vampire Mistress, it was first published in 1828 in a weekly paper called The Casket. Elizabeth's maiden name was Duncan and she was the niece of \\"Miss Duncan\\", a famous actress of the late 18th century. Elizabeth married \\"Colonel Grey\\", a reporter for the Morning Chronicle, about whom very little else is known. Elizabeth Grey worked at a London school for girls. In her spare time wrote silver fork novels, such as Sybil Lennard (1846), about a Swiss orphan who rises to become a governess in England; it has been described by John Sutherland as resembling the fiction of the Bront√´ sisters. She also wrote penny dreadfuls such as Murder Will Out (1860) and The Iron Mask (1847). Grey's ability to write both \\"proper\\" fiction for polite society, and sensational Gothic and penny dreadfuls (some of which were initially published anonymously), earned her a broad audience in her day. Literary hoax There is suspicion that not all the books attributed to Mrs. Grey were written by her, indeed that her life story as traditionally told (such as in this article) may be a total fabrication. Helen R. Smith, in \\"New Light on Sweeney Todd, Thomas Peckett Prest, James Malcolm Rymer and Elizabeth Caroline Grey,\\" came to the conclusion that James Malcolm Rymer was the author of a string of Penny Dreadfuls confusingly attributed to Mrs. Grey. The penny dreadfuls were published by Edward Lloyd, \\"It is hard to imagine that Elizabeth Caroline Grey, popular author of a large number of 3 volume silver fork novels, could have moonlighted as a penny-a-liner.\\" Grey's name never appeared in any of these penny dreadfuls published by Lloyd, but she was attributed as the author by Andrew De Ternant in an article in Notes & Queries in 1922. In fact, it's now known that Andrew De Ternant was a \\"notorious liar\\", as revealed in a recent investigation by Patrick Spedding in a paper \\"The Many Mrs Greys: Confusion and Lies about Elizabeth Caroline Grey, Catherine Maria Grey, Maria Georgina Grey and Others\\".Patrick Spedding. \\"The Many Mrs Grey: Confusion and Lies about Elizabeth Caroline Grey, Catherine Maria Grey, Maria Georgina Grey and Others\\". The Papers of the Bibliographic Society of America. Indeed, Spedding says the traditional life story of Grey, which can be ultimately sourced back to Andrew De Ternant's version, and later replicated in respectable encyclopaedias such as John Sutherland's Companion to Victorian Fiction, is a total fabrication. The Skeleton Count, or The Vampire Mistress The Skeleton Count, or The Vampire Mistress (1828) is a penny dreadful allegedly written by Grey (see above concerning dispute of penny dreadful authorships). In 1995, anthologist Peter Haining claimed it was the first vampire story written and published by a woman. Haining claimed that it was first published in the English weekly paper The Casket in 1828 (no relation to other magazines of the same name) and that a collector brought him the only known copy of the story. Contrary to Haining's claim, no other editors have included the story in collections of vampire tales, and the provenance of the tale is suspect. Haining has espoused controversial literary positions before involving the alleged historicity of the popular penny dreadful Sweeney Todd.

The irregularity of an algebraic surface is sometimes defined to be this Hodge number, and sometimes defined to be the dimension of the Picard variety, which is the same in characteristic 0 but can be smaller in positive characteristic. The name \\"irregularity\\" comes from the fact that for the first surfaces investigated in detail, the smooth complex surfaces in P3, the irregularity happens to vanish. The irregularity then appeared as a new \\"correction\\" term measuring the difference p_g - p_a of the geometric genus and the arithmetic genus of more complicated surfaces. Surfaces are sometimes called regular or irregular depending on whether or not the irregularity vanishes. For a complex analytic manifold X of general dimension, the Hodge number h^{0,1}= \\\\dim H^1(\\\\mathcal{O}_X) is called the irregularity of X, and is denoted by q. Complex surfaces For non-singular complex projective (or K√§hler) surfaces, the following numbers are all equal: *The irregularity; *The dimension of the Albanese variety; *The dimension of the Picard variety; *The Hodge number h^{0,1}= \\\\dim H^1(\\\\Omega^0_X); *The Hodge number h^{1,0}= \\\\dim H^0(\\\\Omega^1_X); *The difference p_g - p_a of the geometric genus and the arithmetic genus. For surfaces in positive characteristic, or for non-K√§hler complex surfaces, the numbers above need not all be equal. Henri Poincar√© proved that for complex projective surfaces the dimension of the Picard variety is equal to the Hodge number h0,1, and the same is true for all compact K√§hler surfaces. The irregularity of smooth compact K√§hler surfaces is invariant under bimeromorphic transformations. For general compact complex surfaces the two Hodge numbers h1,0 and h0,1 need not be equal, but h0,1 is either h1,0 or h1,0+1, and is equal to h1,0 for compact K√§hler surfaces. Positive characteristic Over fields of positive characteristic, the relation between q (defined as the dimension of the Picard or Albanese variety), and the Hodge numbers h0,1 and h1,0 is more complicated, and any two of them can be different. There is a canonical map from a surface F to its Albanese variety A which induces a homomorphism from the cotangent space of the Albanese variety (of dimension q) to H1,0(F). Jun-Ichi Igusa found that this is injective, so that q\\\\le h^{1,0}, but shortly after found a surface in characteristic 2 with h^{1,0}= h^{0,1} = 2 and Picard variety of dimension 1, so that q can be strictly less than both Hodge numbers. In positive characteristic neither Hodge number is always bounded by the other. Serre showed that it is possible for h1,0 to vanish while h0,1 is positive, while Mumford showed that for Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2 it is possible for h0,1 to vanish while h1,0 is positive. Alexander Grothendieck gave a complete description of the relation of q to h^{0,1}in all characteristics. The dimension of the tangent space to the Picard scheme (at any point) is equal to h^{0,1}. In characteristic 0 a result of Pierre Cartier showed that all groups schemes of finite type are non-singular, so the dimension of their tangent space is their dimension. On the other hand, in positive characteristic it is possible for a group scheme to be non-reduced at every point so that the dimension is less than the dimension of any tangent space, which is what happens in Igusa's example. Mumford shows that the tangent space to the Picard variety is the subspace of H0,1 annihilated by all Bockstein operations from H0,1 to H0,2, so the irregularity q is equal to h0,1 if and only if all these Bockstein operations vanish.

From 2000 till 2020, Murtaza served on the science faculty of the Government College University where he directed the Abdus Salam Chair in Physics. Biography Ghulam Murtaza was born in Amritsar, Punjab in the British Indian Empire on 3 January 1939, and was educated in Lahore. Murtaza attended the Government College University in Lahore where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics in 1958‚Äì his graduation was noted when he was awarded the Roll of Honour during the ceremony. He then entered the Punjab University in Lahore and graduated with a Master of Arts (MA) in mathematics, and left for the United Kingdom in 1960. He attended the London University in England, and graduated with Master of Science (MSc) in physics within a year before moving to attend the Imperial College London on financial funding sponsored by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). Murtaza joined Dr. Abdus Salam's doctoral group with Dr. P. T. Matthews where he engaged in research on elementary particles. In 1966, Murtaza defended his thesis on elementary particles, written under the joint supervision of Abdus Salam and P. T. Matthews, and was conferred with a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in theoretical physics, and a Diploma of Imperial College (DIC) from Imperial College in London. His thesis, \\"Some Topics in Elementary Particle Physics, focused towards discussing topics in decaying state in excited elementary particles and Lagrangian mechanics introduced in the concepts of symmetry in quantum mechanics. =Academia and professorship= In 1960, Murtaza instructed courses in mathematics as a lecturer at the Punjab University till 1962 when he found employment with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) as a scientific officer. Upon return to Pakistan in 1966, Murtaza joined the natural science faculty at the Quaid-i-Azam University where he taught physics till 1999. During this time, Murtaza served as Chairman of the Institute of Theoretical Physics twice, and later Dean of the Natural Science Faculty from 1996‚Äì99. In 2000, Murtaza left Quaid-i-Azam University to join the Government College University in Lahore and established the Abdus Salam Chair in Physics.

At PAEC, he collaborated with the Laser Physics Group under Dr. Shaukat Hameed Khan, a laser physicist. His research was originally focused towards understanding elementary particles but became interested in controlled thermonuclear fusion at the Quaid-i-Azam University, and was a participant in early efforts in the mathematical calculations regarding nuclear fission energy during Pakistan's atomic bomb program started in 1972. However, his interest in understanding nuclear fission led him to conduct research in controlled thermonuclear fusion, and he was a founding director of the Fusion Laboratory at the Quaid- i-Azam University. His further research in plasma physics was conducted at the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in 1990s, which he remained associated with in successive years. In his country, Murtaza conducted pioneering research in topics in plasma physics, and published papers in that field in respected international journals. In 2007‚Äì08, Murtaza joined PAEC as the director of the National Tokamak Fusion Program, and oversaw the commissioning of the GLAss Spherical Tokamak (GLAST) at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH). =Recognition= Murtaza is an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow which he was elected to in 1983, a Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences, elected in 1991, and a recipient of the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 1996, and the Khwarizmi International Award in 1997.

Troy is the only child of Jack and Lucille Bolton; Jack is also the coach of the East High basketball team and puts additional pressure on Troy to excel. Troy is also involved with the school's golf team. In the first film, Troy meets Gabriella Montez at a ski lodge karaoke party on New Year's Eve. When the school year resumes, Troy finds that Gabriella is a new student at East High. For fear of what his father, friends, and classmates would think, Troy asks Gabriella not to mention his singing performance to anybody else. However, the secret eventually gets out when Troy and Gabriella unintentionally audition for the winter musical after singing in the auditorium. The news throws East High's social order out of balance. Troy finds himself having to choose between Gabriella and the musical callbacks or his team and the championship game. Although his friends initially try to thwart Troy's chances of being cast as the musical's lead, they help him make both the game and the callbacks, which had been scheduled on the same afternoon. Troy and Gabriella earn the lead roles, somewhat angering the drama department's president, Sharpay Evans. In High School Musical 2, Sharpay has her mind set on capturing Troy's affections and coming between him and Gabriella. Troy, Gabriella, and their friends are hired at a local country club, Lava Springs, but are weary of their new-found employment when they learn the club is owned by Sharpay's parents. Sharpay uses her wealth, power, and influence over Troy, tempting him with college opportunities in exchange for him singing with her at the club's Midsummer Night Talent Show. Troy gives into Sharpay's plot, causing Gabriella, Chad, and their friends to see Troy as a whole new person. Although Troy is being offered a college scholarship, he soon realizes he must not compromise his character while on the quest for his future, and returns to his old self. In the franchise's third film, Troy once again feels uncertain about his future as high school graduation draws near. While Troy is set to attend the University of Albuquerque, he begins to have second thoughts about other schools he and his father talked about. Coach Bolton and Chad are both insistent on Troy attending the university, but he decides to attend University of California, Berkeley in order to pursue both basketball and theater and to be closer to Gabriella, who enrolls at Stanford University. In the first three films, Troy is portrayed by Zac Efron, with Drew Seeley providing his singing voice in the first film.

Gabriella is hesitant, but eventually agrees. Having unearthed a passion for performing at the karaoke party, Gabriella decides to audition for the school musical, but is too late. It is only when the musical's director, Ms. Darbus, overhears Gabriella singing with Troy that she gives them both a callback. Gabriella is uncertain about pursuing the lead role, especially when Taylor and the other members of the decathlon team tell her that the musical will take her focus off the upcoming decathlon event. Taylor and her friends stage an intervention, which portrays Troy as not caring about Gabriella or the musical. Heartbroken, Gabriella drops out of the running for the lead role. However, Taylor eventually confesses what she did and helps Gabriella make the decathlon and the musical auditions. Gabriella and Troy earn the lead roles, beating out Sharpay Evans, who had previously tried to thwart her chances of making the callbacks. In the second film, Gabriella has maintained her romance with Troy, and the couple, along with their friends, get jobs at the Lava Springs country club. Seeking revenge, Sharpay lures Troy away from Gabriella and his friends, showering him with various luxuries, including promising college opportunities. After Troy repeatedly breaks his promises and backs out of his commitments, Gabriella breaks up with him, only for the couple to reunite. In High School Musical 3: Senior Year, a Stanford-bound Gabriella is uneasy about the fast pace her life has taken. Before graduation, Gabriella briefly considers taking classes at the local university for a year and going to Stanford when she is ready, much to the dismay of Taylor and Ms. Montez. Troy urges Gabriella to accept an early orientation. Gabriella goes to Stanford but must drop out of the school musical (allowing Sharpay to fill the lead role) and miss prom.

In High School Musical, Sharpay is shown as being somewhat popular. Students on campus seem to fear her, as they scour to make room for her in the hallways or cafeteria. Fear also appears to be the reason why other students, such as Kelsi Nielsen, remain a part of Sharpay's posse. Sharpay is sometimes the victim of playful jokes and light teasing from the East High basketball team, despite the fact that one of their star players, Zeke Baylor, has a crush on Sharpay. Sharpay's talents are challenged for the first time when Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton are called back for the lead roles in the musical. To ensure that she and Ryan remain in the spotlight, Sharpay convinces Ms. Darbus, the musical's director, to switch the date of the callbacks to the same day as Troy's district championship basketball game and Gabriella's national decathlon. However, Troy and Gabriella still manage to make the callbacks and are cast in the lead roles of Arnold and Minnie. In the second film, Sharpay seems to have gained more popularity, with adoring fans wanting her signature in their yearbooks at the end of the school year. Sharpay plans to steal Troy away from Gabriella during summer vacation. She has the manager of Lava Springs, Mr. Fulton, hire Troy to work at the country club, ordering him to do so, whatever it takes. The cost of Troy's employment is the employment of Gabriella and their friends. Realizing that she must now try to win Troy's affections with extreme measures, Sharpay brings Troy into the high class world of her family, which eventually leads to his promotion and college opportunities. Sharpay also convinces Troy to sing with her in the Midsummer Night Talent Show, abandoning plans to enter the show with Ryan. Ryan begins to step out of Sharpay's shadow and Troy eventually begins to free himself from Sharpay's grip. Sharpay is unable to perform at the talent show, but does join Troy and Gabriella's duet in the background, along with their other friends. Despite having little involvement in the show, the fixed competition's prize, the Star Dazzle Award, was going to be given to her, but she selflessly awards the prize to her brother, who arranged Troy and Gabriella's duet. By the third film, Sharpay's popularity seems to be limited among admiring boys. In her senior year, Sharpay meets Tiara Gold, a British transfer student eager to learn the ropes at East High by becoming Sharpay's student. Tiara's dedication is impressive, but it turns out to be a facade. On opening night of the spring musical, Tiara attempts to upstage Sharpay, but fails. Sharpay does not receive a scholarship to the Juilliard School like she had hoped and will study the dramatic arts at the University of Albuquerque. She has agrees to return to East High to assist Ms. Darbus with the drama department and to continue her reign over Tiara. Sharpay becomes the main protagonist in her independent film, Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure, where she believes she is offered a role on Broadway and travels to New York with her dog, Boi. Her father agrees to give her a one- month limit to prove that she can stand on her own: if she fails, then she will work for him at the Lava Springs Country Club.

Like his sister, Ryan is very much involved with musical theater and performing. However, his interests do not end at theater, as he also enjoys playing baseball and won the junior league world series sometime before the film series. Ryan is well known for wearing different styles of hats. In the first film, Ryan is depicted as being dim-witted and completely submissive to Sharpay, though this could be because he likes Troy and Gabriella. When Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez threaten Ryan and Sharpay's chances of being cast as the leads at East High's winter musical, Ryan assists Sharpay in making sure Troy and Gabriella's scheduled conflict with the callback dates. The plan falls through and Troy is cast in the lead role.

However, he begins to step out of his sister's shadow when she decides to enter the talent show with Troy.

Only after the end of the franchise, David Simpatico, one of the writers, revealed Ryan's homosexuality, describing him as a \\"coded gay\\" ‚Äì characters without revealed sexuality by the rules of the studios, a controversial topic when talking to children and teenagers.

However, news soon spreads around school that Troy and Gabriella Montez, a new student, have auditioned for the school musical and have been called back for the lead roles. Hoping to keep Troy's head in the game, Chad and his teammates stage an intervention while Taylor McKessie and her friends, who want Gabriella to stay focused on the national decathlon team, do the same with Gabriella. The plan is successful, but Chad and Taylor soon realize that they hurt their close friends. After admitting their guilt, they help Troy and Gabriella make the callbacks, as well as the game and decathlon. At the end of the film, Chad asks Taylor on a date.

Hoping to save up for a car, Chad takes a job at the Lava Springs country club for the summer, alongside Troy, Gabriella, Taylor, and their friends. Chad reluctantly agrees to participate with the other employees in the Midsummer Night Talent Show at the club.

Articles of Gabriella's academic achievements at her old schools are placed in Taylor's locker. Although Gabriella did not slip the articles in the locker, she agrees to join the decathlon team at Taylor's suggestion. However, when Gabriella's interest begins to turn to the school musical and Troy Bolton, Taylor teams up with Troy's best friend, Chad, to make sure they can keep their friends away from one another and focused on the prize. While Chad and his basketball teammates explain to Troy that they will not win the district championship game if he is involved with the musical, they film him saying that the musical and Gabriella are not important. Taylor show Gabriella the footage and she is left heartbroken. Realizing the magnitude of what they have done, Taylor and Chad work together again to make sure Troy and Gabriella make the musical callbacks.

When Kelsi tells Sharpay that she imagined the song to be much slower, Sharpay belittles her and Kelsi retreats. After auditions, Kelsi is approached by Troy and Gabriella, who tell her she does not have to be intimidated by Sharpay. She offers to show them how the song they sang is supposed to sound. Troy and Gabriella sing the duet ballad and Ms. Darbus, who had re-entered the auditorium, gives them a callback. Kelsi works with Troy and Gabriella to ensure that they beat out Sharpay and Ryan for the lead roles.

Tiara later overhears Gabriella Montez talking to Taylor McKessie about an early orientation at Stanford University, which would make Gabriella unable to perform as the lead in the musical. Tiara informs Sharpay, who is impressed by her dedication. Gabriella leaves for the orientation, allowing Sharpay to take over her part. Tiara, in turn, takes over Sharpay's former role.

He played quarterback for Harvard from 1888-1890 and was selected as an All-American in 1890. Dean also fought with the Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. College athlete at Harvard A native of Lake Village, New Hampshire, Dean enrolled at Harvard University. While at Harvard, Dean was the quarterback for Harvard's varsity football team. He became famous for his role in Harvard's November 1890 football victory over Yale‚Äîthe first since the schools first met in 1875. A newspaper account of the game described a touchdown run from midfield by Dean. Yale had the ball at midfield when Dean broke through past Hall of Famer Pudge Heffelfinger and batted the ball out of the hands of the Yale quarterback. The report noted: \\"The ball bounded beautifully for the now famous 'Dud.' He caught it as it came up saying, 'Now Dud's your chance.' On the run he was past the Yale backs ... and had a clear field to Yale's unprotected goal.\\" The report called Dean the \\"hero of the day\\" and concluded as follows: > \\"After all has been said, however, about individual players, and a vast deal > might be said, the last word should be devoted to Dudley Dean. If the > Harvard victory can be ascribed to one man more than any other, that man is > Dean. His tackling and breaking through were unsurpassed. At the end of the 1890 season, Dean was selected as the quarterback on the All-American football team.Consensus All-American designations based on the NCAA guide to football award winners Dean also played shortstop and second base for the Harvard baseball team and was captain of that team in 1891. His skills as a baseball player were such that he traveled with Albert Spalding's professional baseball tour of England and was paid ¬£4 a week plus expenses. Military service During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Dudley enlisted and served with the Rough Riders. In July 1898, after the Battle of San Juan Hill, Dean was one of five members of the regiment mentioned by Theodore Roosevelt for bravery on the battlefield. In his book, \\"The Rough riders, a history of the First United States volunteer cavalry,\\" Roosevelt named Dean as \\"one of the men whom I noticed as leading in the charges and always being nearest the enemy.\\" Upon his return, Dudley told how the Rough Riders had been \\"literally riddled by the murderous fire from ambush.\\" He called Gen. Wood and Col. Roosevelt \\"dandies\\" and noted: \\"It is due to them largely that the rough riders came home in better physical condition than most of the volunteers. Teddy hustled about and saw that food reached us.\\" In October 1898, the New York World published an article titled, \\"Dudley S. Dean, Twice a Hero,\\" which told of his exploits on the gridiron and at the Battle of San Juan Hill: > \\"Dudley S. Dean ... is, as his friends express it, twice a hero. When Col. > Roosevelt organized his regiment of Rough Riders, Mr. Dean was one of the > first to enlist. He served throughout the campaign with distinction, and was > in the thin brown line that charged up San Juan Hill. But his run at > Springfield Nov. 22, 1890, when Harvard defeated Yale, is what endears him > particularly to Harvard football men and the football world in general. On > that occasion Dean ran through the entire Yale team for ninety yards and > scored a goal.\\" During World War II, Dean was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Air Forces and was the executive producer of the play \\"Winged Victory,\\" which ran from November 1943 to May 1944. The play was intended as a morale booster and fundraiser for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The play depicted both the training and work of airmen. Business career After graduating from Harvard, Dudley worked for the El Paso and Western Railroad. He was also a reporter and columnist for the New York World and Boston Globe for a time. Dean was involved for most of his professional career in the mining business, and the companies with which he was associated had extensive land, lumber and mineral holdings in the Gogebic Range of northern Michigan. He was affiliated with the Keweenaw Land Association, Ltd. for more than 50 years. In 1920, Dean was the treasurer of the Keweenaw Land Association, at which time the company owned of timber and mineral lands in the copper belt of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Dean eventually became the company's president. He was also the treasurer of the Newport Land Company. Family and friends Dudley's son, John H. Dean, also played football for Harvard and was captain of the 1933 team. Dudley became friends with Joseph P. Kennedy as the two men spent summers together in Cohasset, Massachusetts. In 1922, Dudley led an unsuccessful campaign to have Kennedy admitted to the Cohasset Golf Club, and several of his letters lobbying for Kennedy's admission were published in the book, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Dean died at his home in Cohasset at age 79.

The status of the genus Profilicollis has been debated, and species placed in this genus were formerly included in the genus Polymorphus. However, research on the morphology of the group and their use of hosts has concluded that Profilicollis and Polymorphus should be regarded as distinct genera, and species previously described as Polymorphus altmani are now referred to as Profilicollis altmani in the literature. Profilicollis parasites infect decapod crustaceans, usually shore crabs, as intermediate hosts, and use many species of shorebirds as definitive (final) hosts. Life cycle This parasite first develops in the haemocoel or digestive gland of shore crabs, which are the intermediate host. The species of crabs that are parasitized differs between Profilicollis species. Mole crabs in the genus Emerita are parasitized throughout North and South America by Profilicollis altmani. After infection of the crab, the parasite becomes a dormant cystacanth until the crab is eaten by a suitable bird, such as the surf scoter Melanitta perspicillata or herring gull, Larus argentatus (the final or definitive host). Once the parasite cystacanth has passed through the stomach of the bird, it develops into the adult worm and attaches to the intestines of the bird. Eggs produced by the parasite are released from the bird with bird feces and enter the ocean. Here the eggs are transported by the currents until they are ingested by a filter-feeding mole crab. The southern sea otter, Enhydra lutris nereis is an accidental host (or paratenic host) of Profilicollis altmani and P. major. Between 1998 and 2001, between 13% and 16.2% of sea otter carcasses found along the coasts of central California were determined to be caused by acanthocephalan peritonitis, or inflammation of the intestines caused by acanthocephalan parasites. This is a large increase in deaths of sea otters due to these parasites; only a few decades ago, the proportion of sea otters dying because of these parasites was almost negligible. Most of the sea otters that were found to be killed by infections by Profilicollis altmani were either young juvenile or older female otters, and it is hypothesized that they feed on sand crabs because they are less skilled at foraging or because of a decrease in their preferred prey.  Behavioral manipulation  Like many other acanthocephalans, recent studies have shown that the presence of cystacanth of Profilicollis antarcticus causes behavioral alterations due to changes in the levels of hemolymph dopamine in its intermediate host, the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus. These changes in the biogenic amino levels can cause behavioral changes such as changes in response to external stimuli resulting from neurological damages (escape behavior), increased conspicuity resulting from modified pigmentation and/ or behavior and castration. Previous studies have also shown that crabs infected with cystacanths exhibit higher metabolic rates and activity levels than non-parasitized crabs. The free living conditions of cystacanths in the hemocoelomic cavity of the intermediate host maybe interpreted as the direct way of altering the dopamine metabolic pathway.The alteration of dopamine levels in the hemolymph system implies that there is a generalized effect of the parasite on the body of its intermediate host, rather than an effect on the nerve ganglion level. Therefore, the increase in activity and metabolic rates for this host parasite system could be a consequence of higher metabolic cost of maintenance for the host, linked to the synthesis of monoamines and/ or the physiological consequences of their bio-availability. This altered physiological condition is beneficial for the parasite, considering that their final goal is to increase transmission by increasing the probability of predation on the intermediate host(the crab) by its definitive host(the gull).  Species  * Profilicollis altmani (Perry, 1942) Infects mole crabs as intermediate hosts in North and South America. Final hosts include scoters, Melanitta spp.; gulls, Chroicocephalus maculipennis, Leucopheus pipixcan, Larus modestus, and L. dominicanus; lesser scaup, Marilla affnis; sanderling, Calidris alba; dunlin, Calidris alpina; whimbrel, Phaeopus hudsonicus; rhinoceros auklet, Cerorhinca monocerata; and willet, Catoptrophorus semipalmatus. This species was moved to this genus by Van Cleave, 1947. * Profilicollis antarcticus (Zdzitowiecki, 1985) Infects shore crabs such as Hemigrapsus crenulatus and gulls such as Larus dominicanus in Chile and New Zealand. * Profilicollis arcticus (Van Cleave, 1920) * Profilicollis botulus (Van Cleave, 1916) Infects shore crabs such as Hemigrapsus oregonensis and the invasive green crab Carcinus maenas as well as the lobster Homarus americanus. Its final hosts are shorebirds such as common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula; Barrow's goldeneye, B. islandica; greater scaup, Aythya marila; eider duck, Somateria mollissima; and long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis. * Profilicollis chasmagnathi (Holcman-Spector, Mane-Garzon and Dei-Cas, 1977) Infects estuarine crabs (described in Uruguay) and gulls, including Larus atlanticus. The species was moved to this genus by Golvan, 1994. * Profilicollis formosus Schmidt and Kuntz, 1967 Infects Macrobrachium and domestic ducks in Taiwan. * Profilicollis major Lundstr√∂m, 1942 Infects the Atlantic rock crab Cancer irroratus, although likely other species as well. This parasite has also found in the intestines of sea otters, although it appears to be much less pathogenic to the otters than Profilicollis altmani. * Profilicollis novaezelandensis (Brockerhoff, 2002) Infects shore crabs such as Hemigrapsus crenulatus, and mud crabs Macrophthalmus hirtipes and Helice crassa. They then infect birds such as the South Island pied oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus finschi and bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica in New Zealand. * Profilicollis sphaerocephalus (Bremser, 1819) Infects many grapsid crabs (including Brachynotus spinosus, Cyclograpsus granulosus, Paragrapsus gaimardii, Paragrapsus laevis and Paragrapsus quadridentatus) 1 species of portunid crab (Nectocarcinus integrifrons). This species also infects gulls. Proposed Synonyms * Profilicollis kenti and Profilicollis texensis were described as parasitizing mole crabs in North America, in addition to the species Profilicollis altmani. Morphological examination first suggested that Profilicollis kenti and Profilicollis texensis were synonyms of Profilicollis altmani. Later, DNA sequencing of acanthocephalans sampled form the mole crab Emerita analoga in the Pacific and E. talpoida in the Atlantic showed that only one species of acanthocephalan was present in Emerita crabs in North America. * Profilicollis bullocki was reported as parasitizing the mole crabs in Chile and Peru. DNA sequences were used to test whether the species Profilicollis bullocki in South America was genetically distinct from Profilicollis altmani in North America. The parasites from the mole crab Emerita analoga in Chile and E. rathbunae in Panama were found to be highly similar to the acanthocephalans from mole crabs in North America, strongly suggesting they are the same species. Later research showed that acanthocephalan parasites from the Atlantic coast of South America (Uruguay) are also genetically similar, and belong to the same species.

The equation was first described by Firdaus E. Udwadia and Robert E. Kalaba in 1992. The approach is based on Gauss's principle of least constraint. The Udwadia‚ÄìKalaba equation applies to both holonomic constraints and nonholonomic constraints, as long as they are linear with respect to the accelerations. The equation generalizes to constraint forces that do not obey D'Alembert's principle.  Background  The Udwadia‚ÄìKalaba equation was developed in 1992 and describes the motion of a constrained mechanical system that is subjected to equality constraints. This differs from the Lagrangian formalism, which uses the Lagrange multipliers to describe the motion of constrained mechanical systems, and other similar approaches such as the Gibbs-Appell approach. The physical interpretation of the equation has applications in areas beyond theoretical physics, such as the control of highly nonlinear general dynamical systems.  The central problem of constrained motion  In the study of the dynamics of mechanical systems, the configuration of a given system S is, in general, completely described by n generalized coordinates so that its generalized coordinate n-vector is given by :\\\\mathbf{q}:=[q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n]^\\\\mathrm{T}. where T denotes matrix transpose. Using Newtonian or Lagrangian dynamics, the unconstrained equations of motion of the system S under study can be derived as a matrix equation (see matrix multiplication): (t)=\\\\mathbf{Q}(q,\\\\dot{q},t)\\\\,, cellpadding = 6 border = 1 border colour = black background colour=white}} where the dots represent derivatives with respect to time: :\\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\frac{dq_i}{dt}\\\\,. It is assumed that the initial conditions q(0) and \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}(0) are known. We call the system S unconstrained because \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}(0) may be arbitrarily assigned. The n-vector Q denotes the total generalized force acted on the system by some external influence; it can be expressed as the sum of all the conservative forces as well as non-conservative forces. The n-by-n matrix M is symmetric, and it can be positive definite (\\\\mathbf{M} > 0) or semi-positive definite (\\\\mathbf{M} \\\\geq 0). Typically, it is assumed that M is positive definite; however, it is not uncommon to derive the unconstrained equations of motion of the system S such that M is only semi-positive definite; i.e., the mass matrix may be singular (it has no inverse matrix). = Constraints = We now assume that the unconstrained system S is subjected to a set of m consistent equality constraints given by : \\\\mathbf{A}(q,\\\\dot{q},t)\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{b}(q,\\\\dot{q},t), where A is a known m-by-n matrix of rank r and b is a known m-vector. We note that this set of constraint equations encompass a very general variety of holonomic and non-holonomic equality constraints. For example, holonomic constraints of the form : \\\\varphi(q,t) = 0 can be differentiated twice with respect to time while non-holonomic constraints of the form :\\\\psi(q,\\\\dot{q},t) = 0 can be differentiated once with respect to time to obtain the m-by-n matrix A and the m-vector b. In short, constraints may be specified that are #nonlinear functions of displacement and velocity, #explicitly dependent on time, and #functionally dependent. As a consequence of subjecting these constraints to the unconstrained system S, an additional force is conceptualized to arise, namely, the force of constraint. Therefore, the constrained system Sc becomes =\\\\mathbf{Q}+\\\\mathbf{Q}_{c}(q,\\\\dot{q},t), cellpadding = 6 border = 1 border colour = black background colour=white}} where Qc‚Äîthe constraint force‚Äîis the additional force needed to satisfy the imposed constraints. The central problem of constrained motion is now stated as follows: #given the unconstrained equations of motion of the system S, #given the generalized displacement q(t) and the generalized velocity \\\\dot{q}(t) of the constrained system Sc at time t, and #given the constraints in the form \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\ddot{q}=\\\\mathbf{b} as stated above, find the equations of motion for the constrained system‚Äîthe acceleration‚Äîat time t, which is in accordance with the agreed upon principles of analytical dynamics.  Equation of motion  The solution to this central problem is given by the Udwadia‚ÄìKalaba equation. When the matrix M is positive definite, the equation of motion of the constrained system Sc, at each instant of time, is : \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{Q} + \\\\mathbf{M}^{1/2}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\\\right)^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}), where the '+' symbol denotes the pseudoinverse of the matrix \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}. The force of constraint is thus given explicitly as : \\\\mathbf{Q}_c = \\\\mathbf{M}^{1/2}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\\\right)^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}), and since the matrix M is positive definite the generalized acceleration of the constrained system Sc is determined explicitly by : \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q} + \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\\\right)^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}). In the case that the matrix M is semi-positive definite (\\\\mathbf{M} \\\\geq 0), the above equation cannot be used directly because M may be singular. Furthermore, the generalized accelerations may not be unique unless the (n + m)-by-n matrix : \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{M}} = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\mathbf{M}  \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\end{array}\\\\right] has full rank (rank = n). But since the observed accelerations of mechanical systems in nature are always unique, this rank condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining the uniquely defined generalized accelerations of the constrained system Sc at each instant of time. Thus, when \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{M}} has full rank, the equations of motion of the constrained system Sc at each instant of time are uniquely determined by (1) creating the auxiliary unconstrained system : \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}}:=(\\\\mathbf{M}+\\\\mathbf{A}^+\\\\mathbf{A})\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{Q} + \\\\mathbf{A}^+\\\\mathbf{b} := \\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b}, and by (2) applying the fundamental equation of constrained motion to this auxiliary unconstrained system so that the auxiliary constrained equations of motion are explicitly given by : \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b} + \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{1/2}(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b}). Moreover, when the matrix \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{M}} has full rank, the matrix \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A} is always positive definite. This yields, explicitly, the generalized accelerations of the constrained system Sc as : \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b} + \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b}). This equation is valid when the matrix M is either positive definite or positive semi-definite. Additionally, the force of constraint that causes the constrained system Sc‚Äîa system that may have a singular mass matrix M‚Äîto satisfy the imposed constraints is explicitly given by : \\\\mathbf{Q}_{c} = \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{1/2}(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\mathbf{b}).  Non-ideal constraints  At any time during the motion we may consider perturbing the system by a virtual displacement Œ¥r consistent with the constraints of the system. The displacement is allowed to be either reversible or irreversible. If the displacement is irreversible, then it performs virtual work. We may write the virtual work of the displacement as :W_c(t)=\\\\mathbf{C}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}(q,\\\\dot{q},t)\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{r}(t) The vector \\\\mathbf{C}(q,\\\\dot{q},t) describes the non-ideality of the virtual work and may be related, for example, to friction or drag forces (such forces have velocity dependence). This is a generalized D'Alembert's principle, where the usual form of the principle has vanishing virtual work with \\\\mathbf{C}(q,\\\\dot{q},t)=0. The Udwadia‚ÄìKalaba equation is modified by an additional non-ideal constraint term to : \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\mathbf{Q} + \\\\mathbf{M}^{1/2} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\\\right)^ + (\\\\mathbf{b}-\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q}) + \\\\mathbf{M}^{1/2}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{I}-\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\\\right)^+\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\\\right]\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\\\\mathbf{C}  Examples  Inverse Kepler problem = The method can solve the inverse Kepler problem of determining the force law that corresponds to the orbits that are conic sections. We take there to be no external forces (not even gravity) and instead constrain the particle motion to follow orbits of the form :r=\\\\varepsilon x + \\\\ell where r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \\\\varepsilon is the eccentricity, and <math display=\\"inline>\\\\ell is the semi-latus rectum. Differentiating twice with respect to time and rearranging slightly gives a constraint :(x-r\\\\varepsilon)\\\\ddot{x} + y\\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\frac{(x\\\\dot{y}-y\\\\dot{x})^2}{r^2} We assume the body has a simple, constant mass. We also assume that angular momentum about the focus is conserved as :m(x\\\\dot{y}-y\\\\dot{x})=L with time derivative :x\\\\ddot{y}-y\\\\ddot{x}=0 We can combine these two constraints into the matrix equation :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x-r\\\\varepsilon & y  y & -x \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\ddot{x}  \\\\ddot{y} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\frac{L^2}{m^2r^2}  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} The constraint matrix has inverse :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x-r\\\\varepsilon & y  y & -x \\\\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ell r} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & y  y & -(x-r\\\\varepsilon) \\\\end{pmatrix} The force of constraint is therefore the expected, central inverse square law :\\\\mathbf{F}_c = m\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\frac{m}{\\\\ell r} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & y  y & -(x-r \\\\varepsilon) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\frac{L^2}{m^2r^2}  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = -\\\\frac{L^2}{m\\\\ell r^2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta  \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} = Inclined plane with friction = Consider a small block of constant mass on an inclined plane at an angle \\\\alpha above horizontal. The constraint that the block lie on the plane can be written as :y=x\\\\tan\\\\alpha After taking two time derivatives, we can put this into a standard constraint matrix equation form :\\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\ddot{x}  \\\\ddot{y} \\\\end{pmatrix} = 0 The constraint matrix has pseudoinverse :\\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}^+ = \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha  1 \\\\end{pmatrix} We allow there to be sliding friction between the block and the inclined plane. We parameterize this force by a standard coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force :\\\\mathbf{C}=-\\\\mu m g \\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\sgn\\\\dot{y} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\alpha  \\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\end{pmatrix} Whereas the force of gravity is reversible, the force of friction is not. Therefore, the virtual work associated with a virtual displacement will depend on C. We may summarize the three forces (external, ideal constraint, and non-ideal constraint) as follows: :\\\\mathbf{F}_\\\\text{ext}=\\\\mathbf{Q}=-mg \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  y \\\\end{pmatrix} :\\\\mathbf{F}_{c,i}=-\\\\mathbf{A}^+\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{Q} = mg\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha  1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  y \\\\end{pmatrix} = mg \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\cos\\\\alpha  \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\end{pmatrix} :\\\\mathbf{F}_{c,ni}=(\\\\mathbf{I}-\\\\mathbf{A}^+\\\\mathbf{A})\\\\mathbf{C}=-\\\\mu m g \\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\sgn\\\\dot{y} \\\\left[ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} - \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha  1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\tan\\\\alpha & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right] = -\\\\mu m g \\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\sgn\\\\dot{y} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha  \\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\end{pmatrix} Combining the above, we find that the equations of motion are :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\ddot{x}  \\\\ddot{y} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{F}_\\\\text{ext} + \\\\mathbf{F}_{c,i} + \\\\mathbf{F}_{c,ni} \\\\right) = -g\\\\left( \\\\sin\\\\alpha+\\\\mu\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\sgn\\\\dot{y} \\\\right) \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\alpha  \\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\end{pmatrix} This is like a constant downward acceleration due to gravity with a slight modification. If the block is moving up the inclined plane, then the friction increases the downward acceleration. If the block is moving down the inclined plane, then the friction reduces the downward acceleration.

Retrieved on 2009-05-19. Background The protest was led by the Pan-Green Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The demonstrators wanted a referendum on the \\"Economic cooperation framework agreement\\" (ECFA). Some have been made uneasy by the improvement of cross-strait relations with China given China's goal of unification with Taiwan. DPP also objects to the amendments that have been proposed to the Assembly and Parade Act, which the groups believes would restrict the right of people to assemble and put more power into the hands of authorities. Protest In both protests, in Taipei and Kaohsiung, protesters assembled in four groups to march separately to a common, central point. The number of protesters involved varies by source, with organizers estimating 600,000 participants in Taipei and police less than 80,000. Organizers estimated 150,000 to 200,000 participants, possibly more, in Kaohsiung, while police placed the number at 30,000. Two injuries were reported among men from Bade City, Taoyuan County who were struck by a police car, said to be driving very quickly, as they were crossing Hangchou South Road behind Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. 67-year-old Hsu was only slightly injured, but 59-year-old Chang required surgery for his critical injuries. The protest plan called for a 24-hour sit-in at the end of the marching in front of the Presidential Office to begin at 10:00 p.m. on Sunday.

It is an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant serving fresh salads, made-from-scratch soups, homemade breads, and more. All locations are in the Southwestern United States, with the majority located in Texas. The chain is privately owned and has been in operation since 1978. As of May 2020, the chain had 17 locations. History Signage In 1978, the first Souper Salad was opened by Ray Barshick in Houston, Texas. Barshick subsequently opened locations all across Texas and then began to expand to the Western United States. In 2009, the company began selling franchises. By the middle of 2008, it had grown to 151 stores in 17 states before declining to 80 stores at the end of 2010 as a result of the long recession that began in 2008 causing fewer people to dine at restaurants. In 2011, the parent corporation (SSI Holding Group Corp.) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to poor performance resulting from recession. From July 2011 to the September bankruptcy filing, at least 25 locations were closed, leaving 56 locations in operation. In 2012, Souper Salad was acquired by LNC Ventures, which was owned by Dan and Jackie Hernandez. By late 2013, the chain was down to 45 locations. In 2014, the company, with 37 locations, was acquired by Brix Holdings, LLC., which is based in Dallas. After the acquisition, Dan Hernandez remained president of Souper Salad until 2016. Locations Restaurant in \\"futuristic building\\" The company operates restaurants in ten cities in Texas. Franchised locations are in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The first location in South Texas opened in McAllen in October 2016. This location is the first of a new contemporary design and a kitchen with induction cooking. One location in Phoenix, Arizona is located in a former modernist bank building designed by architect Wenceslao Sarmiento. The building, originally home to a branch of Western Savings and Loan outside the Metrocenter mall, was listed as one of the \\"10 Coolest Buildings in Metro Phoenix\\" by Phoenix New Times in 2014 and an \\"architectural marvel\\" by AZfamily.com in 2016. When built in 1975, it was futuristic or mid- century modern with a ribbed conical tower clearly visible from the adjacent Interstate 17. Format Souper Salad provides prepared salads and a variety of salad ingredients and dressings at a self-serve salad bar that can be in length. Four different soups are provided daily, as well as breadsticks, a selection of muffins, pizza, baked potatoes, pastas, tacos. Desserts include fresh and canned fruits, strawberry shortcake, pudding, brownies, and soft serve ice cream. Specific menu items change daily and seasonally. The company says the food is made fresh daily in each store (without use of centralized offsite facilities) and free of trans-fats since 2007. It also provides gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options. It has offered a variety of seafood options including fish soups, salads, and tacos for the Lenten season. Sandwiches were tested in 2008 in San Antonio. With the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, all of the restaurants went to cafeteria style service. Marketing Customers who joined the Souper Fresh Club by providing personal information and an email address receive discount coupons electronically as well as a coupon for an annual free birthday meal. The program was later changed such that purchases earn \\"points\\" towards rewards as well as a coupon for a discounted birthday meal. A study of casual dining chains by the consumer intelligence firm Market Force Information in 2013 ranked Souper Salad as the first in the buffet category. The study of over 7000 consumers praised the chain for the healthiness of its food. Litigation In 2014, the company settled a class action lawsuit brought on by one employee alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The suit claimed that this one tipped worker was not fairly paid for required duties such as cleaning, stocking, and other general activities that did not directly generate customer tips, thus having the effect of working for less than the minimum wage during the portions of shift spent performing such duties. The US Department of Labor says employees should not be classified as tip-only employees if they perform non-tipped work more than 20% of the time. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The suit asked for minimum wage differential compensation, as well as attorney's fees, and interest. LNC Ventures Dan and Jackie Hernandez were 2002 graduates from the University of Texas and Texas A&M; when they began frequenting an Austin Souper Salad. They operated ten Subway franchises in Laredo and Cotulla until 2010 when they were sold to another franchisee based out of Houston. They then purchased a Souper Salad in San Antonio and opened a second location in 2011. Their company, LNC Ventures later bought the chain after the 2011 bankruptcy for approximately $4 million. LNC divested many company stores to franchise-owned locations, with 22 of 45 locations being franchises by July 2013. Parent Brix Holdings, LLC. acquired Souper Salad in 2014. Brix Holdings operates several other restaurant chains, including RedBrick Pizza, Red Mango Cafe, Smoothie Factory Juice Bar, and Greenz. Brix determined that reducing store size from by 50% made stores more profitable.

Other structures in the compound already in existence are being utilized for various school activities such as library, clinic, speech laboratory, audio-visual room, etc. It was in the school year 1993-1994 when High School started, in consonance with the official change of name to Pasig Christian Academy signifying both its status and goals.

Constantly in trouble from 1570, he was not found to be nonconformist in doctrine, but was an opponent of the episcopate. Life He was the third son of John Dering, Esq., of Surrenden- Dering, Kent, and Margaret, his wife, daughter of John Brent of Charing, Kent. Richard Dering who was the grandfather of Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet was his elder brother. He received his education at Christ's College, Cambridge where he was admitted Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1560 and shortly afterwards was elected a Fellow. He commenced Master of Arts (Cambridge) (MA Cantab.) in 1563. In the following year Queen Elizabeth visited the university, and proceeded to make a tour of the colleges; on her arrival at Emmanuel College, Dering presented her with a congratulatory copy of Greek verses. In 1566 he was university proctor, and the next year preacher before the university on the Lady Margaret foundation. On 28 November 1568 he was collated by Matthew Parker to the rectory of Pluckley, his home parish. He also appears about this time to have been one of the chaplains to the Duke of Norfolk, and to have held a chaplaincy in the Tower of London, where he preached on 11 December 1569, a powerful sermon, afterwards printed. He was chosen by Parker as the scholar best qualified to reply to the Catholic Sander (Nicholas Sanders, sometimes, Sander) and his treatise, De Visibili Monarchia; and he was employed by the privy council to draw up a series of answers to a book which at the time was supposed to have been written by Cartwright. His Sparing Restraint was a reply to Thomas Harding, the Jesuit opponent of John Jewel. But on 25 February 1570 he preached vehemently at court before the queen, his text being Ps. lxxviii. 70, a fierce indictment against the clergy, and directly addressed Elizabeth herself whom he made responsible. This was a major turning-point, and the offence thus given meant he was suspended from preaching. He then took a leading part in the resistance to the new statutes of 1570, which were imposed on the University of Cambridge after the expulsion of Cartwright [see Cartwright, Thomas (1535‚Äì1603)]. In November 1570 he addressed a letter to William Cecil, the chancellor of the university, in which he freely criticised the new statutes and their authors with remarkable freedom; and 24 March 1572 he wrote again on behalf of Cartwright, urging that he should be permitted to return to Cambridge and to lecture there. In 1572 he was appointed divinity reader at St. Paul's Cathedral, and delivered a series of well-attended expositions on the earlier chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews. In the preface (22 April 1572) to 'A briefe and necessarie Catechism,' he renewed his attacks on the clergy. 'There was never no nation,' he said, 'which had so ignorant ministers'. In 1573 he was suspended from his lectureship and summoned before the Star-chamber. He was there charged with having given utterance to unwarrantable and unorthodox sentiments, and more especially with having predicted that Parker, his former friend, would be the last archbishop of Canterbury. This charge he sought to explain away. Examined as to his general agreement with the doctrine of the Thirty-nine Articles, his answers were deemed satisfactory. His sentence of suspension from his lectureship was cancelled. But when an effort was made in 1574 to obtain for Dering the appointment of lecturer at Whittington College as successor to Thomas Sampson, Parker put his veto on the proposal. Shortly after this Dering's health began to give way. In 1572 he married Anne Locke, who nursed him as he succumbed to tuberculosis.Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster, Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia (2006), p. 74. He died 26 June 1576 at Thoby, in the parish of Mountnessing, Essex.

Biography Si Frumkin was born on November 5, 1930, in Kaunas, Lithuania, to Mykolas and Zila (n√©e Waisapel) Frumkinas. When the German Army invaded Lithuania in 1941, Frumkin was sent to the city's Jewish ghetto with his parents. At the time of the ghetto's liquidation in 1944, Si Frumkin and his father were sent to Dachau concentration camp. His father died 20 days before the camp's liberation in 1945. \\"A Tribute to Si Frumkin\\" Congressional Record Volume 155, Number 81 (Tuesday, June 2, 2009). Website accessed November 22, 2015. After the war, Frumkin studied in Switzerland and England before briefly immigrating to Venezuela, where he was reunited with his mother, who had been deported to Poland. Frumkin arrived in New York in 1949 and graduated from New York University with a bachelor's degree in 1953. Shortly after graduation, he moved to Los Angeles and took over Universal Drapery Fabrics, a downtown textile company. At night, he earned a master's degree in history at California State University, Northridge, which he completed in 1964. When Frumkin became aware of the plight of Soviet Jews in the late 1960s, he at first tried, without success, to mobilize the local Jewish Federation Council to take action on the issue. Subsequently, he devoted himself to advocacy on behalf of Soviet Jewry, and founded the Southern California Council for Soviet Jews in 1968.\\"Si Frumkin, Soviet Jewry activist\\" (May 21, 2009).

The seizing of both bridges was considered to be critical to securing the eastern flank of the Normandy landings area, preventing German armour from reaching the British 3rd Infantry Division which was due to start landing on Sword at 07.25hrs. Horsa Bridge, a road bridge, was over 400 yards east of Pegasus Bridge towards the village of Ranville. Renaming of the bridge Following the capture of the bridge over the Orne, members of the coup de main operation supported naming the bridge 'Light Infantry Bridge'. The captured Benouville Bridge had been sign-boarded Pegasus Bridge. After the Second World War the bridge over the Orne became known as Horsa Bridge, in recognition of the Horsa gliders that had carried the troops to the bridge. The original bridge, which was a steel lattice swing bridge, was replaced in 1971; however, some of the original bridge support structure remains. In June 1989, on the forty-fifth anniversary of D-Day, the mayor of Ranville unveiled a plaque to commemorate the capture of the river bridge, and the bridge was officially named Horsa Bridge. The memorial plaque was dedicated to the glider pilots and Lieutenant Dennis Fox's and Lieutenant Tod Sweeney's platoons, which had captured the bridge before the Allied invasion of the Normandy beaches began.

Many of the comedy gags were devised by an uncredited Buster Keaton. Plot Union Newsreel reporter Chris Hunter is sneakier and has fewer scruples than his rivals in war-torn China. When the Japanese do not oblige with a convenient aerial attack to film, Chris fakes one with a model aircraft with his cameraman Jos√© Estanza. Outraged when he finds out, Chris' main competitor, Atlas Newsreel's Bill Dennis decides to do the same, having his aviator friend Alma Harding fly in \\"serum\\" for an imaginary cholera outbreak. Chris finds out and swoops in to film her landing. Jos√©, however, drives too close to the aircraft, causing it to crash and burst into flames. Chris rescues Alma, but when he starts to go back for the serum, she has to admit the truth, telling him that it is a fake. Chris piles on lie after lie to romance Alma, even pretending to get fired by his boss, \\"Gabby\\" MacArthur, for burning the footage. Chris convinces her to work for Union. She reveals that she needs the money to mount a search for her brother Harry, lost in the Amazon jungle and given up for dead by everyone else. They travel to New York (where Gabby is eagerly awaiting the landing footage Chris is secretly bringing). Bill follows to protect the woman he has loved for years from his unscrupulous competitor. However, the whole charade is eventually revealed, discrediting Chris, Bill and Alma. Both reporters are fired, and people begin to question whether Alma's brother is really missing. Chris' budding romance with Alma is quashed when she learns of his numerous lies. Ashamed, Chris and Bill hock their equipment and have Jos√© pretend to be a generous, kind-hearted South American plantation owner. He presents Alma with nearly $8,000 and a compass supposedly from Harry's aircraft. He tells her one of his workers brought it to him. In reality, Chris etched a fake serial number on it. Alma buys a floatplane and supplies, and sets out for South America. Both Chris and Bill follow. They eventually find a native who claims to know where Harry is. Despite Jos√©'s warning that the man is a follower of voodoo and means them no good, Alma is convinced when the native produces Harry's watch. To protect Alma, Chris and Jos√© set out on their own with their guide in a canoe. As they near the village, the native escapes, though Jos√© shoots and wounds him. Chris spots an ill white man through his binoculars. Jos√© suspects the natives intend to sacrifice him that night, so, using their camera equipment, Chris makes the frightened natives believe he is a powerful magician or god. He and Jos√© tend to the unconscious man. Despite a tense moment when their former guide shows up and denounces them, Chris maintains a tenuous control of the situation. When he hears Alma flying by, he has the natives show the wreckage of Harry's aircraft. She and Bill land nearby. Chris disguises himself and his cameraman as witch doctors, and film Alma and Bill without their knowledge. The natives finally turn hostile. Alma and Bill get Harry into their aircraft, but when Chris and Jos√© try to board it (still in disguise), Bill hits Chris. The aircraft takes off, leaving Chris and Jos√© to paddle for their lives. When Alma, Bill and Harry return to New York, they are welcomed by reporters.

The ruins are situated by the River Windrush. History The south-east tower Minster Lovell Hall was built by William Lovell around 1440.A. J. Taylor, Minster Lovell Hall (1947), p. 2. As Minster Lovell was one of the earliest estates held by the Lovell family and one of their main residences it was at least the second building occupying this site.A. J. Taylor, Minster Lovell Hall (1958), pp. 16-18. The Hall was a fairly typical if impressive manor house. The buildings surround three sides of a square; the fourth side towards the River Windrush was closed off by a wall. The great tower at the south-west corner seems to be a later addition to the house, as part of the adjoining west wing had to be rebuilt.Taylor, (1947), p. 7. Minster Lovell Hall remained the main residence of the Lovell family. Richard III visited it as a guest of Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell, grandson of William Lovell.J. Williams, 'The Political Career of Francis Viscount Lovell. 1456-?', The Ricardian 8 (1990), p. 389. Francis Lovell's estates were declared forfeit after the Battle of Bosworth and Minster Lovell was granted to Jasper Tudor, uncle of Henry VII.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1485-1494, p. 64. The property changed hands several times over the next two centuries.Taylor (1947), p. 2 Among the owners were Henry VIII's gentlemen of the stool, William Compton and Henry Norris.E. W. Ives, 'Norris, Henry (b. before 1500, d. 1536)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 30 Oct 2008 - subscribers only The property was bought in 1603 by Sir Edward Coke. The manor remained in the Coke family for several generations, and Thomas Coke, created Baron Lovel in 1728, abandoned Minster Lovell Hall in 1747. Large parts of the buildings were dismantled.Taylor (1958), p. 29. By the early nineteenth century the ruins of Minster Lovell Hall were thought to have been the buildings of an alien priory.Taylor (1958), p. 16 Legend According to one report a skeleton was discovered in the basement of Minster Lovell Hall in 1718 and was thought to be that of Francis Lovell who had hidden there after the Battle of Stoke and had died of starvation.For the discovery at Minster Lovell see Notes and Queries, 2nd series i. and 5th series x; F. Peck, Memoirs of Oliver Cromwell, p. 87, cited after A.J. Taylor, (1958), p. 19. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely this is the case. Francis Lovell spent little time in Minster Lovell and therefore would have no faithful servant there who could hide and feed him for years. Today The quite extensive ruins of Minster Lovell Hall are now in the care of English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The most prominent features are the Hall with its ornamented entrance porch and the south west tower. A dovecote, probably also built in the fifteenth century, is also part of the site. The ruins are also a scheduled Ancient Monument.

The main principle is a notepad with a wiki-style interface. Words in the note body that match existing note titles automatically become hyperlinks, allowing for the management of large libraries of personal information, such as references to favorite artists that would then automatically be highlighted in notes containing their names.

The river was named after William Henry Suttor on 7 March 1845 by explorer Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington. Suttor had given Leichhardt some bullocks for his expedition. The Suttor River Causeway is a stone causeway built across the Suttor River on the Old Bowen Downs Road (today at St Anns Road, Mount Coolon). It was built in 1876 by Queensland Department of Public Works and is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register as a rare example of the road construction techniques and materials employed in the state at the time.

He played as a centre forward. Career Massart was born in the Yardley district of Birmingham. He joined hometown club Birmingham as an amateur in 1938, and turned professional in February 1939, but had not played for the first team when the outbreak of the Second World War put a stop to the Football League. He played intermittently in the later years of wartime competition, contributing 9 goals from 11 games as Birmingham won the Football League South in the 1945‚Äì46 season,Matthews, pp. 239‚Äì40. and finally made his debut in the Second Division on 7 September 1946 in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Burnley.Matthews, p. 182. Described as \\"a real old-fashioned number nine\\", Massart scored freely for the reserves but was unable to establish himself in the first team. In the 1947 close season, Massart joined up with former Birmingham clubmate Harry Hibbs, then manager of Third Division South club Walsall. He made a spectacular start to his Walsall career, scoring a hat-trick in each of the first three home games. He finished up with 23 goals from 27 league games, which made him Walsall's leading scorer for 1947‚Äì48, despite moving back to the Second Division with Bury in March 1948, well before the end of the season. Bury paid ¬£2,000 for Massart's services. He repaid their investment by scoring 45 goals in 85 league games for the club, becoming their leading scorer for two consecutive seasons. After three years he moved to his last Football League club; Chesterfield paid ¬£6,000 for his services in February 1951 in the hope that his goalscoring might save them from relegation from the Second Division. Five goals from 11 games was too little too late, and Massart moved into non-league football with Weymouth before the 1951‚Äì52 season. He continued in prolific vein at Weymouth. In five seasons he scored 114 goals in 156 games in the Southern League, one of only three Weymouth players to achieve 100 career goals in that competition, and he twice scored hat-tricks in consecutive matches. In his final season, the club organised a benefit match for him against a Football Association Guest XI; 7,000 spectators turned up, far in excess of the usual home attendance. Massart retired from the game in 1956. He remained in Weymouth, Dorset, where he ran a post office and then a hotel. He died in the town in December 1993 at the age of 74.

The opposition surge (sometimes known as the opposition effect, opposition spike or Seeliger effect) is the brightening of a rough surface, or an object with many particles, when illuminated from directly behind the observer. The term is most widely used in astronomy, where generally it refers to the sudden noticeable increase in the brightness of a celestial body such as a planet, moon, or comet as its phase angle of observation approaches zero. It is so named because the reflected light from the Moon and Mars appear significantly brighter than predicted by simple Lambertian reflectance when at astronomical opposition. Two physical mechanisms have been proposed for this observational phenomenon: shadow hiding and coherent backscatter. Overview Asteroid 1 Ceres, imaged by the Dawn spacecraft at phase angles of 0¬∞, 7¬∞ and 33¬∞. The left image at 0¬∞ phase angle shows the brightness surge due to the opposition effect. The phase angle is defined as the angle between the observer, the observed object and the source of light. In the case of the solar system, the light source is the Sun, and the observer is generally on Earth. At zero phase angle, the Sun is directly behind the observer and the object is directly ahead, fully illuminated. As the phase angle of an object lit by the Sun decreases, the object's brightness rapidly increases. This is mainly due to the increased area lit, but is also partly due to the intrinsic brightness of the part that is sunlit. This is affected by such factors as the angle at which light reflected from the object is observed. For this reason, a full moon is more than twice as bright as the moon at first or third quarter, even though the visible area illuminated appears to be exactly twice as large. Physical mechanismsShadow hiding= When the angle of reflection is close to the angle at which the light's rays hit the surface (that is, when the sun and the object are close to opposition from the viewpoint of the observer), this intrinsic brightness is usually close to its maximum. At a phase angle of zero degrees, all shadows disappear and the object is fully illuminated. When phase angles approach zero, there is a sudden increase in apparent brightness, and this sudden increase is referred to as the opposition surge. The effect is particularly pronounced on regolith surfaces of airless bodies in the solar system. The usual major cause of the effect is that a surface's small pores and pits that would otherwise be in shadow at other incidence angles become lit up when the observer is almost in the same line as the source of illumination. The effect is usually only visible for a very small range of phase angles near zero. For bodies whose reflectance properties have been quantitatively studied, details of the opposition effect ‚Äì its strength and angular extent ‚Äì are described by two of the Hapke parameters. In the case of planetary rings (such as Saturn's), an opposition surge is due to the uncovering of shadows on the ring particles. This explanation was first proposed by Hugo von Seeliger in 1887. =Coherent backscatter= A theory for an additional effect that increases brightness during opposition is that of coherent backscatter.Hapke, B. Coherent Backscatter: An Explanation for the Unusual Radar Properties of Outer Planet Satellites Icarus 88: 407:417. In the case of coherent backscatter, the reflected light is enhanced at narrow angles if the size of the scatterers in the surface of the body is comparable to the wavelength of light and the distance between scattering particles is greater than a wavelength. The increase in brightness is due to the reflected light combining coherently with the emitted light. Coherent backscatter phenomena have also been observed with radar. In particular, recent observations of Titan at 2.2 cm with Cassini have shown that a strong coherent backscatter effect is required to explain the high albedos at radar wavelengths. =Water droplets= On Earth, water droplets can also create bright spots around the antisolar point in various situations. For more details, see Heiligenschein and Glory (optical phenomenon). Throughout the Solar System The existence of the opposition surge was described in 1956 by Tom Gehrels during his study of the reflected light from an asteroid.Gehrels, T. (1956) \\"Photometric Studies of Asteroids. V: The Light-Curve and Phase Function of 20 Massalia\\". Astrophysical Journal 195: 331-338. Gehrels' later studies showed that the same effect could be shown in the moon's brightness.Gehrels, T.; Coffeen, T.; & Owings, D. (1964) \\"Wavelength dependence of polarization. III. The lunar surface\\". Astron. J. 69: 826-852. He coined the term \\"opposition effect\\" for the phenomenon, but the more intuitive \\"opposition surge\\" is now more widely used. Since Gehrels' early studies, an opposition surge has been noted for most airless solar system bodies. No such surge has been reported for bodies with significant atmospheres. In the case of the Moon, B. J. Buratti et al. have suggested that its brightness increases by some 40% between a phase angle of 4¬∞ and one of 0¬∞, and that this increase is greater for the rougher-surfaced highland areas than for the relatively smooth maria. As for the principal mechanism of the phenomenon, measurements indicate that the opposition effect exhibits only a small wavelength dependence: the surge is 3-4% larger at 0.41 Œºm than at 1.00 Œºm. This result suggests that the principal cause of the lunar opposition surge is shadow-hiding rather than coherent backscatter.Burrati, B. J.; Hillier, J. K.; & Wang, M. (1996) \\"The Lunar Opposition Surge: Observations by Clementine\\". Icarus 124: 490-499.

The company was founded in 2006 by Ruslan Kogan. Kogan has over 8 million active subscribers. Kogan achieved $3 million in its third year, followed by $8 million in the fourth, $22 million in the fifth, $70 million in the sixth, and over $200 million in the seventh year. Kogan currently sells more than a million dollars of product every day, and has been growing at between 200% and 300% per year since its 2006 inception. The Wall Street Journal speculated Kogan is personally worth over $400M back in 2013. In March 2016, Kogan.com acquired Dick Smith Holdings's online business.The physical retail stores have been shut down, with the Dick Smith brand transitioned to an online-only consumer electronics store. In July 2016, Kogan was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. History Kogan.com was established in 2006 by Ruslan Kogan in his parent's garage. He started with a website offering LCD televisions that would be assembled for him in Chinese factories. In October 2010, Ruslan Kogan announced that Kogan.com would expand to the UK. The company officially entered the UK market on 15 November, with a range of LED TVs and GPS units. The expansion makes Kogan the only Australian-owned international consumer electronics brand. On 14 September 2011, Kogan began shipping products from the company's Hong Kong operation to customers all around the world. Bypassing wholesalers, distributors and retailers in this way enabled the company to offer products by brands including Apple, Canon, Nikon, Samsung, Motorola and more at low prices. On 15 March 2016, Kogan.com acquired Dick Smith Holding's online business. With the physical retail stores shut down, the Dick Smith brand transitioned to an online-only consumer electronics store. On 7 July 2016 Kogan.com floated on the Australian Stock Exchange.  Businesses  Kogan Retail and Kogan Marketplace = High Definition LCD televisions and LED televisions make up the bulk of Kogan.com' products. In 2011, after asking its customers whether they would like to see Kogan supply 3D televisions, the company also released a range of 3D TVs. Kogan also sells the Agora range of computing products, including a laptop, a netbook and 8\\" and 10\\" tablets. The Agora range are powered by Google's open source Chromium and Android operating systems ‚Äì the Agora laptop was the world's first Chromium-powered laptop. The Agora netbook's specifications were chosen after customer feedback through the Kogan weblog. Kogan also offers a region-free Blu-ray player and a range of digital internet radios. Kogan also sells a range of home appliances, including microwave ovens, an automatic coffee machine, and a vacuum cleaner. In 2012, Kogan released a series of new products into its line, starting in January with its Android wireless keyboard and track pad. The device, which claims a distance of 20 meters unobstructed wireless range, works with almost anything which has a USB including Android, Linux, Windows, and OSX as well as Smart TV's, Xbox, PlayStation, and Home Theatre Systems. Soon after, Kogan.com added brand name tech products such as the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, iPad 2 and the Apple MacBook air, selling them at discount prices. In March 2012, Kogan began selling its custom iPad dock and speaker system that uses a custom iOS app for music playback and internet radio streaming. Kogan.com has also caused controversy with its product range. The company voiced its opposition to the Australian government's proposed Internet filter by releasing a fictional parody product, the Kogan Portector, and received media attention in 2009 parodying Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2007 election campaign because of its \\"Kevin 37\\" television, a 37\\" television marketed using advertising mimicking Rudd's campaign, which initially sold for $900 ‚Äì the value of the economic stimulus payments made to many Australians in April 2009. = Exclusive Brands = In July 2014, Kogan.com launched its first exclusive brand beyond consumer electronics, called Fortis. By controlling the design, manufacture, packaging and distribution of the products, Kogan.com had increased the number of exclusive brands available to 10, within a year. = Kogan Pantry = In January 2015 Kogan.com launched Kogan Pantry, an online service delivering non-perishable foods, confectionery, cleaning products, toiletries, and pet food. Kogan Pantry has a smaller range of products than the biggest Australian supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths. However, independent consumer group Choice says the prices at Kogan pantry are 50-60% less than the big supermarkets. According to News.com.au, over 30,000 products were sold within the first six hours of the launch. = Kogan Mobile and Kogan Internet = Vodafone  Kogan Mobile was re-launched in Australia on the Vodafone network on 19 October 2015. Kogan Mobile is offering 3G & 4G network. Kogan will be using the Vodafone network, and Vodafone will handle all customer service.  Telstra / ispONE  Kogan Mobile was a pre-paid mobile phone service provider in Australia. It was known for being the first pre-paid mobile provider to use the widespread Telstra network. Kogan Mobile launched on 12 December 2012. By 14 December, it had already sold more than 10,000 SIM cards. In response to the announcement, a spokesman from Telstra stated; \\"Telstra Wholesale is not in partnership or any other direct relationship with Kogan.\\" Kogan Mobile experienced many problems with customers being suspended for \\"overuse\\" despite offering an \\"unlimited call\\" plan. Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN), stated that Kogan was \\"falling afoul\\" of the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code, introduced in September 2012, which states that a product cannot be called unlimited if it is not actually unlimited. Kogan stated that they did not suspend customers but is rather the provider ispONE. In April 2013, Kogan took the provider ispONE to the Victorian Supreme Court. Kogan won an injunction ordering service provider ispONE to reinstate the 600 accounts of Kogan Mobile users it had suspended after deeming them to be using excessive the service in excess of the levels permitted. The Business Review Weekly said this was not a good start for the 4-month-old [mobile] business. The Kogan Mobile service ended with the collapse of ispONE on 19 August 2013.  Kogan nbn  On 7 June 2017, Kogan.com announced that it has extended its partnership with Vodafone to 2022. As a part of the partnership, Kogan.com announced that it will offer fixed-line NBN services as well as mobile broadband plans. Kogan nbn launched on 12 April 2018. The service is supplied to Kogan by Vodafone as supplied by nbn Co Limited. = Kogan Insurance = On 27 July 2017, Kogan.com made an announcement on the ASX, unveiling its first move into financial services with Kogan Insurance. Kogan Insurance was added to Kogan.com's portfolio on 1 August 2017, launching with simple and affordable home, contents, landlord, car and travel insurance at reasonable prices. Kogan Insurance is underwritten by The Hollard Insurance Company.  Kogan Health  On 12 December 2017, Kogan.com announced a brand new partnership with Medibank Group in early 2018. The agreement enables Kogan.com to offer budget health insurance policies under a new brand called Kogan Health. The agreement is for an initial period of three years and will be administered via Medibank's wholly owned subsidiary ahm, and underwritten by Medibank Group.  Kogan Pet  Following the Kogan Health announcement, on 18 December 2017, Kogan announced that the company had signed a partnership with PetSure Australia Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Hollard Insurance Company, to provide pet insurance. Kogan Pet Insurance officially launched on 17 April 2018.  Kogan Life  On 25 January 2018, Kogan.com announced that it was growing its portfolio with Life Insurance. It announced on the ASX that it had entered into an agreement with Greenstone Financial Services Pty Ltd, to offer life and funeral insurance under Kogan Life Insurance. Kogan Life Insurance officially launched on 17 April 2018. = Kogan Money = In November 2018, Kogan launched a home loan offering.  Marketing  LivePrice = On 1 December 2010 Kogan announced the launch of LivePrice, an invention that allows consumers to buy a product before it is manufactured for a discounted price. After launching LivePrice in Australia, Kogan sold nearly $330,000 worth of products using the new pricing system in 24 hours. After being operational in Australia for less than three weeks, LivePrice had resulted in over $370,000 of price deductions across the entire range. LivePrice has a patent pending. =UK Cable Con= In July 2011 Kogan launched its \\"Cut the Cable Con\\" campaign in Britain. The campaign targeted John Lewis and Currys, criticising the way that such retailers attempt to sell expensive cables with their new televisions and computers, and accusing them of a campaign of \\"deliberate misinformation\\" with regard to this issue. Kogan.com began giving away cables free of charge with every television purchased. John Lewis and Currys defended the practice of charging for cables by pointing out the various features of their cables. Kogan responded by stating: \\"I think it's a bit misleading what they've said. When it comes to durability, it's an HDMI cable that you'll use to connect your TV to a Blu-ray player, or a Playstation, or another device. You're not using it as a skipping rope or to go rock climbing with.\\" =Divorce from traditional retail= In August 2011 Kogan announced his desire for online retailers to be viewed separately from traditional retail by economists, stating that \\"If we have been grouped with traditional retailers, then we want a divorce!\\", and arguing that all of the innovation and growth is in online, rather than bricks-and-mortar, retail. Business Magazine BRW noted the similarity of the \\"divorce\\" to a campaign by NAB. Financial results Sales at Kogan's online store in November 2011 were $8.12 million, up 330% from $1.89 million in the same period in 2010. During the period there were 708,525 visitors to Kogan.com.au, an increase from 222,411 the year before. In October 2010, BRW ranked Kogan as Australia's 15th fastest growing company with yearly revenue of $12.22 million. Also in 2010, the company released Q1 FY11 growth figures, with revenue up 48.12% on the previous quarter. The business recorded its highest single day of sales ever on 31 July 2012, exceeding $1 million in transactions. In October 2012, Kogan again made the BRW. list of Australia's fastest growing businesses, this time ranking at No. 14, noting a 123% growth rate since 2011. The professional services firm, Deloitte, listed Kogan as one of the top 10 on the Fast 50 Australia in November 2012. In 2017, Kogan.com released its FY17 results, which showed revenue of $289.5 million, up 37.1% on the prior year. It also grew its customer base to 955,000, up 36.0% from 30 June 2016. Kogan.com was the best performing stock on the ASX All Ordinaries index in 2017, with an annual gain of more than 300 per cent. Awards The company has won the following awards: *2017 StarTrack ORIAS People's Choice Award ‚Äî Large Retailer *BRW 2011 Fast 100 at rank 27, ranking the fastest growing companies in Australia in any sector and any size. *BRW 2010 Fast 100 at rank 15, ranking the fastest growing companies in Australia in any sector and any size. *BRW 2010 Fast Starters list at rank 17. *BRW named Kogan the 15th fastest growing company in Australia, with 106.74% growth. *Australian Retailer's Association Retail Innovator of the Year 2010 *BRW 2009 Fast Starters list at rank 37 *Power Retail's Top 100 Online Retailers of 2014, at rank 3. Controversies2009 advertising controversy= In April 2009 the company was ordered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to modify its advertising, after it was accused of possible misleading conduct. The ACCC stated that price comparisons in the retailer's advertisements in the Herald Sun newspaper and on its website may have misled customers, and the ACCC's chairman Samuel said the advertisements may have breached sections of the Trade Practices Act 1974. In response, Kogan.com agreed that it would not advertise its products at a discount unless that product had been advertised for sale at a higher price, that it would implement a trade practices law compliance program, and that it would not make representations about the savings available to consumers unless the basis by which those savings are calculated was also stated. =Harvey Norman= In August 2010 Kogan began a public dispute with Gerry Harvey, co-founder of well-known Australian retailer Harvey Norman. The argument concerned the future of consumer electronics retailing in Australia, and in particular whether Australians should shop online or in a bricks and mortar retailer. Kogan challenged Harvey to a TV debate, which he declined. Kogan claimed Harvey \\"chickened out\\", causing Harvey to respond by calling Kogan a \\"con\\". Kogan responded with two satirical advertisements criticising Harvey Norman. Kogan renewed the dispute in November 2010, criticising Harvey Norman's purchase of Clive Peeters. The controversy continued into December, when Harvey announced plans to follow Myer and open up an online store based in China to avoid GST and cut costs, causing Kogan to claim that Harvey Norman and Myer were posturing to force the Government to change import laws, and that their China-based stores were a hoax. Kogan stated that if Harvey Norman and Myer succeeded in opening their China-based online stores for three months, he would place a prominent link on kogan.com.au advertising his rival's store. Kogan also claimed that Harvey Norman was \\"full of it\\", and published an article lamenting the Australian business scene's focus on regulation rather than innovation. In July 2011, Kogan came to the public defence of Harvey when he came under fire for Harvey Norman's alleged logging practices. Kogan stated: \\"Like him or hate him, Gerry Harvey is not a criminal ‚Äì he should not be singled out for some supposed moral crime simply because he has complied with the law, and has sought Australian timber to use in his furniture.\\" =JB Hi-Fi= In March 2011, Kogan argued that some of Australia's biggest retailers were overly reliant upon the success of Apple, claiming that 30% of Australian retailer JB Hi-Fi's revenue in 2010 had come from Apple or Apple related products. Terry Smart, CEO of JB Hi-Fi, responded by saying \\"That figure is not even close to reality. We don't have a big enough supply that represents such a substantial part of the business.\\" Kogan responded by challenging Smart to a one million dollar bet that JB Hi-Fi would not stock Apple hardware by 14 March 2014. The deed for the bet is still available online, though it has not been accepted. Kogan also began giving away free HDMI cables to anyone who had bought a TV from JB Hi-Fi in 2011, accusing JB of \\"trying to trick people into thinking they need a $200 cable after buying a FULL HD TV.\\" In October 2011, Kogan took out a full page ad in Australia's biggest newspaper calling for JB Hi-Fi to change their slogan, \\"Always Cheapest Prices.\\" JB Hi-Fi did not respond to the challenge. =Australian government set-top box scheme= In May 2011 the Australian Government announced a plan to provide television set-top boxes to pensioners free of charge. Kogan and other leading retailers criticised the scheme for spending too much money. In 2011, the program had an estimated total cost of $308 million, with each installation costing over $350. Kogan said his company could deliver it for $50 million. In February 2012 new figures revealed that the cost per installation had risen to $698, prompting Kogan to make further public statements attacking the Government's inefficiency in spending. However, it was later clarified by the Federal Government that these figures were falsely reported by The Australian newspaper and that installations ranged from $158.00 to $492.00. It was revealed on 8 February 2012 during parliamentary question time, that Kogan.com had tendered for the Scheme to roll-out set-top boxes for New South Wales which commenced in June 2012.http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/157571/A030-2012_Document_27.pdf =Apple vs. Samsung= When Kogan began selling the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 in September 2011, Apple demanded that the company immediately stop selling the product, because of an ongoing patent dispute with Samsung. Apple also demanded full details of Kogan's suppliers. Kogan agreed to stop selling the product until the patent dispute was resolved, but refused to disclose any further information. The Federal Court overturned the injunction on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 on 30 November 2011, and Kogan began selling the product again soon after. =Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 tax= On 13 June 2012 Kogan introduced a Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 'tax', which charged any user shopping at the site from IE7 an extra 6.8% ‚Äì 0.1% for every month the browser had been on the market. Kogan explained that he had decided to charge the 'tax' because: \\"The amount of work and effort involved in making our website look normal on IE7 equalled the combined time of designing for Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\\" Kogan accepted that it was unlikely that anyone would actually pay the charges, stating that the goal of the campaign was to encourage users to download a more up-to-date version of Internet Explorer, or a different browser. The 'tax' was the most talked about topic on social media service Twitter on the day following its launch. Several weeks later, search results for kogan.com disappeared from Microsoft Bing search results, with Kogan stating \\"We hope Microsoft were not too offended by what we did with the IE7 tax and this is just a temporary glitch.\\" Microsoft denied tampering with the search results, stating that: \\"The ranking of our results is done in automated manner through our algorithm which can sometimes lead to unexpected results.\\" = 2018 ACCC case = Kogan raised the prices of over 600 products then offered a 10% discount to their customers as part of an end of financial year promotion. The court found Kogan breached consumer law by making false and misleading representations about the end of financial year promotion in 2018.

It was painted in Rome for Prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna (1637‚Äì1689), Claude's most important patron in his last years, and is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It is signed, dated with the year, and inscribed with the subject (at centre bottom), as Claude sometimes did with his less common subjects.Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 24, 101 It was Claude's last painting, and is perhaps not quite finished; it therefore does not appear in the Liber Veritatis, where he made drawings to record his finished works. His date of birth is uncertain, but he was at least in his late seventies when he painted it, perhaps as old as 82. It was a pendant to his painting, completed six years earlier, View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas (or Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthage, 1676, now Kunsthalle, Hamburg), another scene from the Aeneid, coming earlier than this one. This was the last of Claude's many harbour scenes. With the Oxford painting hung on the left, the groups of figures in each face inwards, and the main buildings frame the outsides of the pair.Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 101 Both paintings feature large columns on a classical building, a punning reference to the Colonna family, who included such a column in their coat of arms.Wine (1994), 101, 103 The painting depicts a scene from book 7, verses 483‚Äì499, of Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid. Aeneas's son Ascanius shoots a stag that is the house-reared pet of Silvia, daughter of \\"Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king\\" (John Dryden's translation), provoking a war with Latium for the future site of Rome.Kitson, 31 Virgil's account, over 16 lines, spends most of them describing the closeness of the relationship between Sylvia and the stag. The moment shown is one of stillness, as Ascanius takes aim and the stag, too trusting in its special status, looks at him. Once the arrow is fired the tranquil coastal landscape spreading out behind them will very quickly be disrupted by the war that Virgil goes on to describe.Waterhouse, 207 Unusually for Claude, the sky is overcast with storm clouds, and the trees are bent by a wind blowing from the left.Waterhouse, 207‚Äì208 The elaborate temple in the Corinthian order has long been falling into ruin. On the face of it this, in a scene from before the founding of Rome, is an anachronism that would have been apparent even in the 17th century, but it reflects the state to which ancient Roman monuments were reduced in Claude's own time. The painting therefore embraces the whole trajectory of Roman civilization across history, from its start to its end, and peoples an idealized landscape from Claude's time with figures from its early history.Waterhouse, 212‚Äì214 Subject and composition Vergilius Romanus, 5th-century, Vatican Library, Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto The subject is very rare in art, but there is a composition by Rubens, with a painting in Girona and an oil sketch in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, showing a different point in the story. This is also a late work, but the composition could hardly be more different; here Sylvia nurses the dying stag as a female companion keeps the hounds off it, and fighting has broken out behind them between the Latins and Ascanius' party.The Death of Silvia's Stag, Philadelphia Museum of Art Claude may well have been aware of a depiction in the Vergilius Romanus, a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil in the Vatican Library (Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto), which was a subject of interest to Roman cognoscenti. Stripped of the landscape the elements in the picture are similar, though Ascanius has already wounded the stag, and is pulling the bow for a second shot. A scene closer to the Rubens, with the wounded stag finding Silvia, is in the Vergilius Vaticanus of about 400; curiously, this is the point where the two Late antique Virgil cycles of illustration come closest to matching.Stansbury, Mark, Review of Wright, David H.

The diagonal from left to right thus set up is balanced by the river, which flows in the opposite direction.Waterhouse, 209‚Äì211 The figures The group of hunters Although virtually every painting by Claude contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to his biographer Filippo Baldinucci he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to his other contemporary biographer Joachim von Sandrart he had made considerable efforts to improve them, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings.Wine (1994), 12‚Äì14; Blunt, 275, n. 243 In Claude's last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in this painting, of which even its owner says \\"The hunters are impossibly elongated ‚Äì Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy\\".Ashmolean Press summary for Claude Lorrain: The Enchanted Landscape in 2011 Its pendant has figures almost as extreme. With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition producing such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike. Critical appreciation Prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, the patron, by Jacob Ferdinand Voet Despite the figures, the painting has been one of the most admired of Claude's works. For Anthony Blunt, it \\"reveals all the qualities of the artist's last phase ... The range of colour is reduced to its utmost limits: silvery green trees, pale grey-blue sky, grey architecture, and neutral-coloured dresses for the figures. The trees are now so diaphanous and the portico is so open that they hardly interrupt the continuity of the air. The figures are thin and elongated, so that they, too, have the immaterial quality suited to this fairyland. All the elements of Claude's poetry are here in their most naked form, but combined in a magical way which defies analysis\\".Blunt, 176 For the Claude specialist Michael Kitson it \\"at once sums up and goes beyond Claude's previous development. It is utterly personal and yet has that profound, tremulous and remote quality which characterizes the style of other great artists in their old age.\\"Kitson, 31 Provenance and prices Once completed, the painting remained in the Colonna Palace in Rome until 1798/9,Kitson, 31 when the French occupied Rome, alarming the great families of the nobility.

She was the first English author to publish a sonnet sequence, A Meditation of a Penitent Sinner (1560).P. Collinson, 'Locke [n√©e Vaughan; other married names Dering, Prowse], Anne (c. 1530‚Äì1590x1607)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Life Anne was a daughter of Stephen Vaughan, a merchant, royal envoy, and prominent early supporter of the Protestant Reformation. Her mother was Margaret (or Margery) Gwynnethe (or Guinet), sister of John Gwynneth, rector of Luton (1537-1558) and of St Peter, Westcheap in the City of London (1543-1556). Stephen and Margaret's marriage followed the death of her first husband, Edward Awparte, citizen and Girdler, in 1532, by whom she had five children.Will of Edward Awparte, Girdler of London (P.C.C. 1532). Anne was the eldest surviving child of her second marriage, and had two siblings, Jane and Stephen (b. 4 October 1537). Vaughan obtained a position for his wife as silkwoman to both Anne Boleyn and Catherine Parr. Following her death in 1544,M.K. Dale, 'Vaughan, Stephen (by 1502-49), of St. Mary-le-Bow, London', in S.T. Bindoff (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558 (from Boydell and Brewer, 1982), History of Parliament online. Anne's father took great efforts to find a tutor for the children, selecting a Mr. Cob, who was proficient in Latin, Greek, and French, as well as a dedicated Protestant. Stephen Vaughan remarried in April 1546, to Margery Brinklow, the widow of Henry Brinklow, mercer and polemicist, a long-time acquaintance of the Vaughan family. Vaughan died on 25 December 1549, leaving most of his property to his widow and son, with the rents of one house in Cheapside going to his daughters. John Gwynneth was his executor. In c.1549 Anne married Henry Locke (Lok), a younger son of the mercer Sir William Lok.R. O'Day, 'Lock Anne, n√©e Vaughan', The Routledge Companion to the Tudor Age, Routledge Companions to History (Routledge, London/New York 2010), p. 197 (Google). In 1550, Sir William died, leaving a substantial inheritance to Henry, which included several houses, shops, a farm, and freehold lands. In 1553 the notable Scottish reformer and preacher John Knox lived for a period in the Lok household during which time he and Locke seem to have developed a strong relationship, attested to by their correspondence over the following years. Following the ascension of Mary Tudor, and the accompanying pressure on English nonconformists which saw Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley executed in 1555, Knox encouraged Lock to leave London and join the exiled Protestant community in Geneva. Knox seems to have been worried both for her physical safety and her spiritual health if she remained in London. Henry Lok seems to have been resistant to the idea of entering into exile, as Knox argues that Anne should \\"call first for grace by Jesus to follow that whilk is acceptabill in his sight, and thairefter communicat\\" with her husband. In 1557, Anne managed to leave London. She is recorded to have arrived in Geneva on 8 May 1557, accompanied by her daughter, son, and maid Katherine. Within four days of their arrival, her infant daughter had died. There is no contemporary record of this period, however it is believed that Locke spent her 18 months exile translating John Calvin's sermons on Hezekiah from French into English. Henry Locke remained in London whilst Anne was in Geneva. In 1559, after the accession of Elizabeth I, Anne and her surviving son, the young Henry Locke, who would become known as a poet, returned to England and to her husband. The following year, Locke's first work was published. This consisted of a dedicatory epistle to Katherine Willoughby Brandon Bertie (the dowager Duchess of Suffolk), a translation of John Calvin's sermons on Isaiah 38, and a twenty-one sonnet paraphrase on Psalm 51, prefaced by five introductory sonnets. The volume was printed by John Day, and entered into the Stationers' Register on 15 January 1560. The volume seems to have been popular as it was reprinted in 1569 and 1574 by John Day, although no copies remain of these two editions. Knox and Anne continued to correspond. On 7 February 1559 Lock wrote to Knox asking for his advice on the sacraments administered by the second Book of Common Prayer, and the seemliness of attending baptisms. He strongly encouraged her to avoid services where ceremonies might outweigh worship, but recognised her personal spiritual wisdom, saying 'God grant yow his Holie Spirit rightlie to judge'. Knox sent Anne reports from Scotland of his reforming endeavours, and asked her repeatedly to help him find support among London merchants. During this period, Anne gave birth to at least two children, Anne (baptised 23 October 1561Ôºâand Michael (baptised 11 October 1562). Henry Locke died in 1571, leaving all his worldly goods to his wife. In 1572 Anne married the young preacher and gifted Greek scholar, Edward Dering, who died in 1576. Her third husband was Richard Prowse of Exeter. In 1590 she published a translation of a work of Jean Taffin.Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, Carole Levin, Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England (2007), p. 219.Patrick Collinson, Elizabethan Essays (1994), p. 123.Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster, Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia (2006), p. 74 and p. 161. Works Scholars now agree that Anne Locke published the first sonnet sequence in English, A Meditation of a Penitent Sinner; it comprises 26 sonnets based on Psalm 51. Her other works include a short, four-line Latin poem that appears in a 1572 manuscript of Doctor Bartholo Sylva's Giardino cosmographico coltivato alongside many other dedicatory poems. The manuscript was compiled for presentation to Robert Dudley by Locke, her second husband Edward Dering, and the five Cooke sisters, all staunch supporters of the Protestant cause.Susan M. Felch, \\"The Exemplary Anne Vaughan Lock,\\" in Intellectual Culture of Puritan Women, 1558‚Äì1680, ed. Johanna Harris and Elizabeth Scott- Baumann (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 23. Locke‚Äôs piece puns on Sylva‚Äôs name to testify to his prose, the experience of which is as delightful as a walk through a forest.Susan M. Felch, introduction to The collected works of Anne Vaughan Locke, by Anne Vaughan Locke (Tempe: Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies, 1999), lvii‚Äìlix. The last known work by Locke is a 1590 translation of Of the Markes of the Children of God, a treatise written by the Belgian minister Jean Taffin about the history of Protestantism in Belgium and the other Low Countries. Like her 1560 translation of John Calvin's sermons, this volume ends with an original poem, though only a single short one titled The necessitie and benfite of affliction. It also contains a dedicatory epistle to the Duchess of Warwick, who shared Locke's reformist religious sensibilities.Micheline White, \\"Women Writers and Literary-Religious Circles in the Elizabethan West Country: Anne Dowriche, Anne Lock Prowse, Anne Locke Moyle, Ursula Fulford, and Elizabeth Rous,‚Äù Modern Philology 103 (2005):198. Two printed contemporary references to Locke's poetry and translations evince diverse reactions to religious material produced by a woman. In 1583, John Field printed an edition of Locke's manuscript of a sermon by John Knox, entitled A Notable and Comfortable Exposition upon the Fourth of Matthew. Field's dedication to the volume praises Locke for her willingness to endure exile for religious reform, as well as for her access to the works, in manuscript, of prominent preachers like Knox. The printer urges her to grant him access to more such manuscripts. In contrast, Richard Carew, in the 1602 Survey of Cornwall, specifically praises Locke's intellectual prowess in tandem with her modesty, asserting that her virtuous behaviour evinced her religious learning, in addition to her writing.White, \\"Women Writers,\\" 201‚Äì202. A Meditation of a Penitent Sinner Locke's sonnet sequence is her most well-known work. It was published in 1560 alongside Locke's translations of four of John Calvin's sermons on Isaiah 38, in a volume titled Sermons of John Calvin upon the Songe that Ezechias made after he had bene sicke...Translated out of Frenche into Englishe.Michael R. G. Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First': The Sonnet Sequence of Anne Locke (1560),\\" Renaissance Studies: Journal of the Society for Renaissance Studies 11 (1997):42. Locke probably had access to Calvin's manuscripts, which enabled her to make a close translation of the sermons.Teresa Lanpher Nugent, ‚ÄúAnne Locke‚Äôs Poetics of Spiritual Abjection,‚Äù English Literary Renaissance 39 (2009):3‚Äì5. In the 1560 edition, the translations and sonnets were prefaced by a letter of dedication to Catherine Brandon, duchess of Suffolk.Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First',\\" 41. The duchess, a longtime patron of Protestant writers, also lived in exile during the reign of Mary I; Locke may have known her through their sons, who were both educated at the home of William Cecil.Felch, introduction to '‚ÄôThe collected works of Anne Vaughan Locke'‚Äô, xxxvi. The volume was entered into the Stationers' Register on 15 January 1560 by John Day, a printer known for his publication of Protestant and reformist texts. The sequence begins with five prefatory sonnets, printed under the heading \\"The preface, expressing the passioned mind of the penitent sinner.\\" Another heading, \\"A Meditation of a penitent sinner, upon the 51. Psalme,\\" introduces the remaining twenty-one poems in the sequence. The \\"Meditation\\" poems gloss the nineteen-line psalm line by line, with a few expansions: Locke gives two sonnets each to the first and fourth lines of the psalm; these comprise the first, second, fifth, and sixth poems in the sequence. In the 1560 edition, each line of the psalm appears beside its corresponding poem. This version of the psalm was probably translated by Locke.Nugent, ‚ÄúAnne Lock‚Äôs Poetics of Spiritual Abjection,‚Äù 10. =Poetics= A Meditation of a Penitent Sinner is one work in a long tradition of poetic meditation on the Psalms. Her sequence develops the penitential poetic mode that was also used by late medieval poets.Ruen-chuan Ma, ‚ÄúCounterpoints of Penitence: Reading Anne Locke‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Meditation of a Penitent Sinner‚Äù through a Late-Medieval Middle English Psalm Paraphrase,‚Äù ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews 24 (2011): 33‚Äì41. While both Catholics and Protestants composed poetry in the penitential tradition, Protestant reformers were particularly drawn to Psalm 51 because its emphasis on faith over works favoured their reformist theology.Nugent, ‚ÄúAnne Lock‚Äôs Poetics of Spiritual Abjection,‚Äù 7.Spiller, ‚ÄúA Literary ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô,‚Äù 46. Locke was probably influenced by Sir Thomas Wyatt's translations of the penitential psalms, published in 1549 and accessible to Locke before her Genevan exile. Wyatt's influence is evident in the pattern of psalm lines glossed. Both Locke and Wyatt composed one sonnet per line of the psalm, except for verses 1 and 4, which are each glossed with two poems. Locke's enjambment is also similar to Wyatt's.Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First',\\" 46‚Äì48. Though the sonnet was not an established form of English poetry while Locke composed her sequence, she both uses and disregards features of the sonnet circulating the island during the sixteenth century. It is likely that, in addition to Wyatt's work, Locke also had access to the sonnets of the Earl of Surrey, as she uses Surrey's rhyme scheme, ', now best known as the Shakespearean rhyme scheme. Wyatt's Psalm translations may also have introduced her to Surrey's work, as his volume contains a prefatory sonnet by Surrey. Locke seems to have drawn upon the arrangement of this particular poem, which does not contain the Petrarchan break between octave and sestet. In using this form consistently, Locke sets herself apart from other early English sonnet writers, who generally ascribed to the traditional Petrarchan octave/sestet pair.Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First',\\" 49. =Authorship= Authorship of the sonnet sequence and the translations of Calvin's sermons was first ascribed to Locke by critic Thomas Roche in 1989, in Petrarch and the English Sonnet Sequences. Roche is thus also the first scholar to name her as the author of the first sonnet sequence in English.Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First',\\" 42. Though the volume's dedication to the Duchess of Suffolk is only signed \\"A.L.\\", it is likely that Locke's identity remained identifiable to London's community of English Church reformers,Serjeantson,'Anne Lock's Anonymous Friend: A Meditation of a Penitent Sinner and the Problem of Ascription', in Enigma and Revelation in Renaissance Literature, ed. by Helen Cooney and Mark S. Sweetnam (Dublin, 2012), 51‚Äì68. many of whom, like Locke, lived in exile in Geneva during the reign of Mary I.Nugent, ‚ÄúAnne Locke‚Äôs Poetics of Spiritual Abjection,‚Äù 3‚Äì4. The inclusion of her initials, rather than her full name, allowed her to avoid both perils that plagued female writers during the period ‚Äì anonymity and full exposure ‚Äì who were branded as unchaste if their material was accessible to the broader public.Nugent, ‚ÄúAnne Locke‚Äôs Poetics of Spiritual Abjection,‚Äù 8. Locke's choice of psalm to translate and gloss also favours the case for her authorship of the sequence, and helps her negotiate sixteenth-century England's condemnation of a woman writer as unchaste. Psalm 51 specifies that the experience of God's forgiveness includes speaking God's praise, framing speech as a duty.Margaret P. Hannay, \\"\\"Wisdome the Wordes\\": Psalm Translation and Elizabethan Women‚Äôs Spirituality,\\" Religion and Literature 23 (1991):65‚Äì66. Those who dispute Locke's authorship of the sequence tend to ascribe its authorship to John Knox. When Knox communicated with Locke, however, he wrote in Scots English and would have composed poems in the same dialect; the Meditation sonnets show no grammatical or idiomatic sign of Scots English.Spiller, \\"A Literary 'First',\\" 51.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the company lost most of its state financing, and its work force of 8,000 was cut almost in half. In 1995, Information Satellite System signed a co-operation agreement with the French company Thales Alenia Space. In 2000, the Russian government launched a substantial investment program to revive GLONASS satellite constellation, which provided a massive boost for the company's financial situation.  Products  Information Satellite Systems designs and manufactures communications-, TV broadcasting-, navigation- and geodetic satellites. The company is capable of providing a full range of services for the whole lifetime of a satellite mission, including ground- testing, integration and orbital control. In addition, the company also produces ground antennas for satellite communication. Current activities include being the prime developer of the GLONASS satellite positioning system, and production of the Express series of communications satellites. In addition to communications satellites, the company also produces research spacecraft, such as the Yubileiny research satellite, which was launched in May, 2008.  Economic aspects  The company currently employs about 8,500 people. The company's annual operating budget is 20 billion rubles (US$625 million), of which two-thirds comes from state orders, and a third from commercial orders. Salaries at Information Satellite Systems are twice the national average for engineering graduates. It is the largest satellite producer of the Russian space industry.

The holding is based in Altleiningen in the Rhineland-Palatinate administrative district of Bad D√ºrkheim. The parent company is located in the Palatinate Forest.  History  1423 was the beginning of copper and iron mining in the Altleiningen valley. Johann Nikolaus II Gienanth leased an iron smelt from the Court of Leiningen in 1729. In 1811, Napoleon Bonaparte issued the permit to build a wire drawing factory in Altleiningen which was acquired by the Kuhn-family in 1860. In 1941, Georg Stein acquired the wire drawing factory which produced mainly dowels and chains at that time. In 1948, the product range was extended and new machines were purchased. Nine years later, in the year 1957, the company launches the production of wire goods. The limited commercial partnership Drahtwarenfabrik Drahtzug Stein developed from the company in 1961 and one year later the production of dishwasher baskets has started. In 1964, the company developed a patented system for the production of seamless flux- cored wires which went into production two years later. In 1973, the company founded its first subsidiary Drahtzug Stein saprofil (Soci√©t√© Sablaise de Produits en Fil de Fer) in France. The company is located in Olonne-sur-Mer on the Atlantic coast. Due to up to date manufacturing, the company is market leader in galvanized and plastic coated wire goods for the appliance industry in France. In 1975, a spool for welding rod was patented. The independent marketing and sales of welding consumables started in 1997 =2000 - 2009= In 2000, the corporation acquired an interest in the company Califil in France. The company Drahtwarenfabrik Drahtzug Stein GmbH & Co. KG was converted into a holding company in 2001. In 2003, the Drahtzug Stein Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (investment company) was founded. In the following year, the company DSWI sp.zo.o. (today: Drahtzug Stein lodz) was established as joint venture with Wire Industries in Lodz, Poland. With these measures, Drahtzug Stein follows the outsourcing of the appliance industry to Eastern Europe. Here, the production started in 2005. In 2006, the competitor Wire Industries was acquired by the Drahtzug Stein holding. The Italian and Spanish brands of Wire Industries, omim and come, have been continued independently. The production area in Lodz quadrupled in 2007. In 2005, the subsidiary Drahtzug Stein spb was established in St. Petersburg, and in 2007, Drahtzug Stein usa Corp. was founded in the United States. The workforces increased from initially eight workers (in 1941) to about 550 (in 2009) in the parent plant in Altleiningen.

Just one-kilometre away from Tampines Mall, the entrance of the park and the parking lot are located along Tampines Avenue 9 at the junction of Tampines Avenue 7. In May 2013, it was reported that the Tampines Bike Park will be cleared for development into a new town, less than 3 years after it was presented to Singaporeans as a legacy of the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics held in Singapore. It closed in 2014. History Situated on a 60-hectare site in 2006 by mountain-biking organisation DirTraction and the contractor company RMC Pte Ltd, the current Mountain Bike trail is ten-kilometre long and offers several climbs as well as a challenging contour line rides. The trail hosted the Phat Tyre Sunday Mountain Bike Race in 2007, involving more than 260 participants from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. The trail system is being upgraded to make it even more technically challenging, and in 2008, the bike park hosted BikeAsia100, a 100km mountain biking marathon race, and subsequently eneloop mountain bike carnival in 2009 with its marquee event, a 100km night mountain biking marathon race, one of the first around the region. These mountain biking marathon event attracted riders from the region, bringing close to 700 participants in the 2009 edition. The BMX portion of the park is currently used for dirt jumping by BMX enthusiasts. It is being developed into a full- scaled BMX race track for local community use and to host major international events. The start and finish areas of the mountain bike and BMX courses in the bike park will be adjacent to one another, allowing the spectators the best possible view of both events. 2010 Summer Youth Olympics Tampines Bike Park was used as a competition venue for cycling (BMX and Mountain Bike) during the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. Speaking of the Tampines Bike Park as well as numerous venues and facilities that were specially built for the Youth Olympics, then Minister for Community Development, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, assured Singaporeans that there'll be no white elephants after the Youth Olympics were over as local athletes, sportsmen and weekend sports enthusiasts can use the facilities. However, less than 3 years after the inaugural Youth Olympics in 2010, the HDB announced in May 2013 that earthworks had begun at the Tampines Bike Park to clear it for a new town instead. Closed The Tampines Bike Park was closed as to make way for the future developments of the future Tampines North New Town, which will be an extension of the existing Tampines New Town. The Bike Park had its last day of operations on the 14 September 2014. Plans for a new BMX track to replace the one in Tampines is currently undergoing discussion and planning.

Republican Congressman and future President Richard Nixon defeated Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas, after Democratic incumbent Sheridan Downey withdrew during the primary election campaign. Douglas and Nixon each gave up their congressional seats to run against Downey; no other representatives were willing to risk the contest. Both Douglas and Nixon announced their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950, Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist and was the first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates. Nixon won the Republican primary and Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also finishing third in the other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas‚Äîsome even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio to the detriment of national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20 percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58 counties and all metropolitan areas. Though Nixon was later criticized for his tactics in the campaign, he defended his actions, and also stated that Douglas's positions were too far to the left for California voters. Other reasons for the result have been suggested, ranging from tepid support for Douglas from President Truman and his administration to the reluctance of voters in 1950 to elect a woman. The campaign gave rise to two political nicknames, both coined by Boddy or making their first appearance in his newspaper: \\"the Pink Lady\\" for Douglas and \\"Tricky Dick\\" for Nixon.  Background  California Governor Earl Warren California Senator Sheridan Downey was first elected in 1938. An attorney, he had run unsuccessfully in 1934 for Lieutenant Governor of California as Upton Sinclair's running mate, and had a reputation as a liberal. As a senator, however, his positions gradually moved to the right, and he began to favor corporate interests. Manchester Boddy, the editor and publisher of the Los Angeles Daily News, was born on a potato farm in Washington state. He had little newspaper experience when, in 1926, he was given the opportunity to purchase the Daily News by a bankruptcy court, but built it into a small but thriving periodical. He shared his views with his readers through his column, \\"Thinking and Living\\", and, after initial Republican leanings, was a firm supporter of the New Deal. While the Daily News had not endorsed the Sinclair-Downey ticket, Boddy had called Sinclair \\"a great man\\" and allowed the writer-turned-gubernatorial candidate to set forth his views on the newspaper's front page. Both Helen Douglas and Richard Nixon entered electoral politics in the mid-1940s. Douglas, a New Deal Democrat, was a former actress and opera singer, and the wife of actor Melvyn Douglas. She represented the 14th congressional district beginning in 1945. Nixon grew up in a working-class family in Whittier. In 1946, he defeated 12th district Congressman Jerry Voorhis to claim a seat in the United States House of Representatives, where he became known for his anticommunist activities, including his involvement in the Alger Hiss affair. In the 1940s, California experienced a huge influx of migrants from other US states, increasing its population by 55%. Party registration in 1950 was 58.4% Democratic and 37.1% Republican. However, other than Downey, most major California officeholders were Republican, including Governor Earl Warren (who was seeking a third term in 1950) and Senator William Knowland. During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas were accused of having a voting record comparable to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.  Primary campaign  Democratic contest = Early campaign  Senator Sheridan Downey Douglas disregarded advice from party officials to wait until 1952 to run for the Senate, when Republican Senator Knowland would be up for reelection. Fundraising for the campaign was a concern from the beginning; Douglas friend and aide Ed Lybeck wrote her that she would probably need to raise $150,000 ($1.8 million today), which Douglas considered a massive sum. Lybeck wrote, > Now, you can win. You will not be a favorite; you'll be rather a long shot. > But given luck and money and a hell of a lot of work, you can win ... but > for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough ... Maybe you can't > crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a > statewide candidate upon a cross of no-gold. On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio appearance announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously throughout the remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race. In January 1950, Douglas opened campaign headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which was seen as a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist. Douglas's formal campaign launch on February 28 was overshadowed by rumors that Downey might retire, which Douglas called a political maneuver on Downey's part to get the attention of the press. However, on March 29, amid rumors that he was doing badly in the polls, Downey announced both his retirement and his endorsement of Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy. In his statement, the senator indicated that, due to his ill health, he was not up to \\"waging a personal and militant campaign against the vicious and unethical propaganda\\" of Douglas. Boddy filed his election paperwork the next day, on the final day petitions were accepted, with his papers signed by Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, a Republican, and by Downey campaign manager and 1946 Democratic senatorial candidate Will Rogers, Jr. The publisher had been urged to enter the race by state Democratic leaders and by wealthy oilmen. He had no political experience; Democratic leaders had sought to draft him to run for the Senate in 1946, but he had declined. He later stated that his reasons for running were that the race would be a challenge, and that he would meet interesting people. Boddy, Douglas, and Nixon each \\"cross-filed\\", entering both major party primaries. Douglas called Downey's departure in favor of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News‚Äîone of the few big city papers to consistently support her.  Boddy versus Douglas  Flyer for the Boddy campaign For the first month of Boddy's abbreviated ten-week campaign, he and Douglas avoided attacking each other. Boddy's campaign depicted him as born in a log cabin, and highlighted his World War I service. The publisher campaigned under the slogan, \\"Manchester Boddy, the Democrat Every Body Wants.\\" Boddy stated that he was fighting for the \\"little man\\", and alleged that the average individual was overlooked by both big government and big labor. However, his campaign, having a late start, was disorganized. The candidate himself had little charisma, and little presence as a public speaker. According to Rob Wagner, who wrote of the campaign in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the era, Boddy \\"was all sizzle and no substance\\". The campaign calm broke off near the end of April 1950, when Boddy's Daily News and affiliated newspapers referred to the congresswoman as \\"decidedly pink\\" and \\"pink shading to deep red\\". At the end of the month, the Daily News referred to her for the first time as \\"the pink lady\\". Douglas generally ignored Boddy's attacks, which continued unabated through May. In a Daily News column, Boddy wrote that Douglas was part of \\"a small minority of red hots\\" which proposed to use the election to \\"establish a beachhead on which to launch a Communist attack on the United States\\". One Boddy campaign publication was printed with red ink, and stated that Douglas \\"has too often teamed up with the notorious extreme radical, Vito Marcantonio of New York City, on votes that seem more in the interest of Soviet Russia than of the United States\\". The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper On May 3, Congressman George Smathers defeated liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida. Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent \\"Red Pepper\\" and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, that included a photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio. Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which in the days of the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, \\"It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced ...\\" Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, \\"The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it.\\" She also noted, \\"What a vicious campaign was carried on against him. No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too\\", and \\"It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go.\\" Downey reentered the fray on May 22, when he made a statewide radio address on behalf of Boddy, stating his belief that Douglas was not qualified to be a senator. He concluded, \\"Her record clearly shows very little hard work, no important influence on legislation, and almost nothing in the way of solid achievement. The fact that Mrs. Douglas has continued to bask in the warm glow of publicity and propaganda should not confuse any voter as to what the real facts are.\\" Douglas brought an innovation to the race‚Äîa small helicopter, which she used to travel around the state at a time when there were few freeways linking California's cities. She got the idea from her friend, Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson, who had extensively used helicopters in his campaign in the contested Democratic Party primary for the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas. Douglas leased the craft from a helicopter company in Palo Alto owned by Republican supporters, who hoped her influence would lead to a defense contract. When she used it to land in San Rafael, her local organizer, Dick Tuck, called it the \\"Helencopter\\", and the name stuck. In early April, polls gave Nixon some chance of winning the Democratic primary, which would mean his election was secured. He sent out mailings to Democratic voters. Boddy attacked Nixon for the mailings; Nixon responded that Democratic voters should have the opportunity to express no confidence in the Truman administration by voting for a Republican. \\"Democrats for Nixon\\", a group affiliated with Nixon's campaign, asked Democratic voters \\"as one Democrat to another\\" to vote for the congressman, sending out flyers which did not mention his political affiliation. Boddy quickly struck back in his paper, accusing Nixon of misrepresenting himself as a Democrat. A large ad in the same issue by the \\"Veterans Democratic Committee\\" warned Democratic voters that Nixon was actually a Republican and referred to him for the first time as \\"Tricky Dick\\". The exchange benefited neither Nixon nor Boddy; Douglas won the primary on June 6 and exceeded their combined vote total. = Republican contest = Nixon campaign thimble of 1950 In mid-1949, Nixon, although anxious to advance his political career, was reluctant to run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote \\"I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in my mind, I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority.\\" In late August 1949, Nixon embarked on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race. Nixon announced his candidacy in a radio broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful. Nixon had built part of his reputation in the House on his role in the Alger Hiss affair. Hiss's retrial for perjury after a July 1949 hung jury was a cloud over Nixon's campaign; if Hiss was acquitted, Nixon's candidacy would be in serious danger. On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one from the only living former president, Herbert Hoover. Nixon on his \\"station wagon tour\\" in Sausalito At the end of January 1950, a subcommittee of the California Republican Assembly, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Frederick Houser (who had lost narrowly to Downey in 1944) over Nixon for the Senate candidacy by a 6‚Äì3 vote, only to be reversed by the full committee, which endorsed Nixon by 13‚Äì12. Houser eventually decided against running. Los Angeles County Supervisor Raymond Darby commenced a Senate run, but changed his mind and instead ran for lieutenant governor. Darby was defeated by incumbent Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight in the Republican primary. Knight had also been considered likely to run for the Senate, but decided to seek re-election instead. Actor Edward Arnold began a Senate run, but dropped it in late March, citing a lack of time to prepare his campaign. Nixon was opposed for the Republican nomination only by cross-filing Democrats and by two fringe candidates: Ulysses Grant Bixby Meyer, a consulting psychologist for a dating service, and former judge and law professor Albert Levitt, who opposed \\"the political theories and activities of national and international Communism, Fascism, and Vaticanism\\" and was unhappy that the press was paying virtually no attention to his campaign. Card from the short-lived Darby for Senator campaign On March 20, Nixon cross-filed in the two major party primaries, and two weeks later began to criss-cross the state in his campaign vehicle: a yellow station wagon with \\"Nixon for U.S. Senator\\" in big letters on both sides. According to one contemporary news account, in his \\"barnstorming tour\\", Nixon intended to \\"[talk] up his campaign for the U.S. Senate on street corners and wherever he can collect a crowd.\\" During his nine-week primary tour, he visited all of California's 58 counties, speaking sometimes six or eight times in a day. His wife Pat Nixon stood by as her husband spoke, distributing campaign thimbles that urged the election of Nixon and were marked with the slogan \\"Safeguard the American Home\\". She distributed more than 65,000 by the end of the campaign. A Douglas supporter heard Nixon speak during the station wagon tour, and wrote to the congresswoman: > He gave a magnificent speech. He is one of the cleverest speakers I have > ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty > oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was > waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful‚Äîand, I might add, cagey‚Äîthat those > who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle > went away with doubts ... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was > here you have a formidable opponent on your hands. With no serious challenge from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming victory in the Republican primary, with his cross-filing rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing a small percentage of the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates. = Joint appearances = Douglas supporter and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (left) with President Truman, September 1950 There were no candidate debates, but Douglas and Nixon met twice on the campaign trail during the primary season. The first meeting took place at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, where Nixon waved a check for $100 that his campaign had received from \\"Eleanor Roosevelt\\", with an accompanying letter, \\"I wish it could be ten times more. Best wishes for your success.\\" The audience was shocked at the idea of Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of Democratic former president Franklin Roosevelt and known for her liberal views, contributing to Nixon's campaign. Nixon went on to explain that the envelope was postmarked Oyster Bay, New York, and that the Eleanor Roosevelt who had sent the contribution was Eleanor Butler Roosevelt, the widow of former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt's eldest son. The audience laughed, and Douglas later wrote that she had been distracted and gave a poor speech. A memo from Chotiner several days later noted that Boddy had failed to attend the function, and that Douglas wished that she had also not attended. A second joint appearance took place in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval of what she was saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.  General election  War in Korea, conflict in California = Helen Douglas for U.S. Senate flyer The rift in the Democratic party caused by the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's supporters were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising continued to be a major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but that he would not be heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist. Nixon's positions generally favored large corporations and farming interests, while Douglas's did not, and Nixon reaped the reward with contributions from them. Nixon favored the Taft-Hartley Act, passage of which had been bitterly opposed by labor unions; Douglas advocated its repeal. Douglas supported a requirement that federally subsidized water from reclamation projects only go to farms of not more than ; Nixon fought for the repeal of that requirement. When the Korean War broke out in late June, Douglas and her aides feared being put on the defensive by Nixon on the subject of communism, and sought to preempt his attack. Douglas's opening campaign speech included a charge that Nixon had voted with Marcantonio to deny aid to South Korea and to cut aid to Europe in half. Chotiner later cited this as the crucial moment of the campaign: > She was defeated the minute she tried to do it, because she could not sell > the people of California that she would be a better fighter against > communism than Dick Nixon. She made the fatal mistake of attacking our > strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness. Nixon objected to Douglas's speech, stating that he had opposed the Korea bill because it did not include aid to Taiwan, and had supported it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two- year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight. Nixon realized that the battle in California would be fought over the threat of communism, and his campaign staff began to research Douglas's voting record. Republican officials in Washington sent the campaign a report listing 247 times Marcantonio (who generally followed the Democratic line) and Douglas had voted together, and 11 times that they had not. Nixon biographer Conrad Black suggests that Nixon's strategy in keeping the focus on communism was to \\"distract [Douglas] from her strengths‚Äîa sincere and attractive woman fighting bravely for principles most Americans would agree with if they were packaged correctly‚Äîto scrapping ... on matters where she could not win.\\" Chotiner stated 20 years later that Marcantonio suggested the comparison of voting records, as he disliked Douglas for failing to support his beliefs fully. Douglas franked envelope used to send a copy of a speech to a California voter Public support for the Korean War initially resulted in anger towards communists, and Nixon advocated the passage of legislation he had previously introduced with Senator Mundt which would tighten restrictions on communists and the Communist Party. Douglas argued that there was already sufficient legislation to effect any necessary prosecutions, and that the Mundt-Nixon bill (soon replaced by the similar McCarran-Wood bill) would erode civil liberties. With the bill sure to pass, Douglas was urged to vote in favor to provide herself with political cover. She declined to do so, though fellow California Representative Chester E. Holifield warned her that she would not be able to get around the state fast enough to explain her vote and Nixon would \\"beat [her] brains in\\". Douglas was one of only 20 representatives (including Marcantonio) who voted against the bill. Truman vetoed it; Congress enacted it over his veto by wide margins in late September. Douglas was one of 47 representatives (including Marcantonio) to vote to sustain the veto. In a radio broadcast soon after the veto override, Douglas announced that she stood with the President, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in their fight against communism. = Debut of the Pink Sheet = The Pink Sheet On September 10, Eleanor Roosevelt, the late president's widow and the gubernatorial candidate's mother, arrived in California for a quick campaign swing to support her son and Douglas before she had to return to New York as a delegate to the United Nations. Douglas hoped that the former first lady's visit would mark a turning point in the campaign. At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach, Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed \\"Douglas‚ÄìMarcantonio Voting Record\\", printed with dark ink on pink paper. The legal-size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio, principally in the area of national security, and concluded that they were indistinguishable. In contrast, the flyer said, Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the \\"Douglas‚ÄìMarcantonio Axis\\". It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would be no different from electing Marcantonio, and asked if that was what Californians wanted. The paper soon became known as the \\"Pink Sheet\\". Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy, and \\"for some reason or other it just seemed to appeal to us for the moment\\". An initial print run of 50,000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500,000, distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California. Douglas made no immediate response to the Pink Sheet, despite the advice of Mrs. Roosevelt, who appreciated its power and urged her to answer it. Douglas later stated that she had failed to understand the appeal of the Pink Sheet to voters, and simply thought it absurd. Nixon followed up on the Pink Sheet with a radio address on September 18, accusing Douglas of being \\"a member of a small clique which joins the notorious communist party-liner Vito Marcantonio of New York, in voting time after time against measures that are for the security of this country\\". He assailed Douglas for advocating that Taiwan's seat on the United Nations Security Council be given to the People's Republic of China, as appeasement towards communism. Late in September, Douglas complained of alleged whispering campaigns aimed at her husband's Jewish heritage, and which stated that he was a communist. At the end of September, the splits in the Democratic Party became open when 64 prominent Democrats, led by George Creel, endorsed Nixon and castigated Douglas. Creel said, \\"She has voted consistently with Vito Marcantonio. Belated flag-waving cannot erase this damning record, nor can the tawdry pretense of 'liberalism' excuse it.\\" According to Creel, Downey was working behind the scenes to secure Nixon's election. James Roosevelt's lackluster campaign led Douglas backers to state that he was not only failing to help Douglas, he was not even helping himself. With polls showing the two major Democratic candidates in dire straits, Roosevelt wrote to President Truman, proposing that Truman campaign in the state in the final days before the election. Truman refused to do so. He also declined Douglas's pleas for a letter of support (privately calling her \\"one of the worst nuisances\\"), and even refused to allow her to be photographed with him at a signing ceremony for a water bill which would benefit California. When Truman flew to Wake Island in early October to confer with General Douglas MacArthur regarding the Korean situation, he returned via San Francisco, but told the press he had no political appointments scheduled. He spoke at an event at the War Memorial Opera House during his stopover, but both Roosevelt and Douglas were relegated to orchestra-level seats, far from the presidential box. Vice President Alben Barkley did visit the state to campaign for the Democrats. However, Time magazine wrote that he did not appear to be helpful to Douglas's campaign. The Vice President stated that while he was not familiar with Douglas's votes, he was certain that she had voted the way she did out of sincere conviction and urged Californians to give the Senate a \\"dose of brains and beauty\\". Attorney General McGrath also came to California to campaign for the Democrats, and freshman Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota tirelessly worked the San Joaquin Valley, talking to farmers and workers. = Name- calling and supporters: the final days = Douglas adopted Boddy's \\"Tricky Dick\\" nickname for Nixon, and also referred to him as \\"pee wee\\". Her name- calling had an effect on Nixon: when told she had called him \\"a young man with a dark shirt\\" in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, \\"Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her.\\" Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that it would be difficult to do, and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was \\"pink right down to her underwear\\". Flyer for a Douglas rally in San Francisco Douglas's last large-scale advertisement blitz contained another Nazi allusion. Citing five votes in which Nixon and Marcantonio had voted together and in opposition to Douglas, it accused Nixon of using \\"the big lie\\" and stated: \\"HITLER invented it/STALIN perfected it/NIXON uses it\\". Nixon responded, \\"Truth is not smear. She made the record. She has not denied a single vote. The iron curtain of silence has closed around the opposition camp.\\" Through the final days of the campaign, he struck a constant drumbeat: Douglas was soft on communism. Though polls showed Nixon well ahead, his campaign did not let up. A fundraising solicitation warned, \\"Right Now Nixon Is Losing ... Not Enough Money\\". Skywriting urged voters to cast their ballots for him. Borrowing an idea from Nixon's 1946 campaign, the campaign announced that people should answer their phones, \\"Vote for Nixon\\"; random calls would be made from campaign headquarters and households that answered their phones that way would receive scarce consumer appliances. Chotiner even instructed that 18-month-old copies of The Saturday Evening Post, containing a flattering story about Nixon, be left in doctor's offices, barber shops, and other places where people wait across the state. In the last days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper endorsed her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this‚Äî30 years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her. Nixon campaign handout Chotiner had worked on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular governor did not want to be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, \\"In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday.\\" Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well. Despite the polls, Douglas was confident that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, so much so that she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59 percent to 41. Of California's 58 counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.  Aftermath  Candidates = Ticket for Nixon's victory dinner A week after the election, Downey announced that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954. It was rumored that Douglas would be given a political appointment in the Truman administration, but the Nixon- Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President. According to Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, the former congresswoman could not have been appointed dogcatcher. In 1952, she returned to acting, and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential run. She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon's 1972 reelection, and called for his ouster from office during the Watergate scandal. Less than a week after the election, Douglas wrote to one of her supporters that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take a large part of the women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or \\"communistic\\". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, \\"Nixon had his victory, but I had mine ... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God.\\" She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, \\"There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how.\\" In 1958, Nixon, by then vice president, allegedly stated that he regretted some of the tactics his campaign had used in the campaign against Douglas, blaming his youth. When the statements were reported, Nixon denied them. He issued press releases defending his campaign, and stating that any impression that Douglas was pro-communist was justified by her record. He said Douglas was part of a whispering campaign accusing him of being \\"anti-Semitic and Jim Crow\\". In his 1978 memoirs, he stated that \\"Helen Douglas lost the election because the voters of California in 1950 were not prepared to elect as their senator anyone with a left-wing voting record or anyone they perceived as being soft on or naive about communism.\\" He indicated that Douglas faced difficulties in the campaign because of her gender, but that her \\"fatal disadvantage lay in her record and in her views\\". = History and legend = Contemporary accounts ascribed the result to a number of causes. Douglas friend and former Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes blamed Roosevelt's weak candidacy and what he believed was Nixon's use of the red scare. Supervisor John Anson Ford of Los Angeles County chalked up the result to Nixon's skill as a speaker and a lack of objective reporting by the press. Douglas's campaign treasurer, Alvin Meyers, stated that while labor financed Douglas's campaign, it failed to vote for her, and blamed the Truman Administration for \\"dumping\\" her. Douglas's San Diego campaign manager claimed that 500,000 people in San Diego and Los Angeles had received anonymous phone calls alleging Douglas was a communist, though he could not name anyone who had received such a call. Time magazine wrote that Nixon triumphed \\"by making the Administration's failures in Asia his major issue\\". As Nixon continued his political rise and then moved towards his downfall, the 1950 race increasingly took on sinister tones. According to Nixon biographer Earl Mazo, \\"Nothing in the litany of reprehensible conduct charged against Nixon, the campaigner, has been cited more often than the tactics by which he defeated Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas for senator.\\" Douglas friend and McGovern campaign manager Frank Mankiewicz, in his 1973 biography, Perfectly Clear: Nixon from Whittier to Watergate, focused on the race and the Pink Sheet, and alleged that Nixon never won a free election, that is, one without \\"major fraud\\". Historian Ingrid Scobie came to a different conclusion in her biography of Douglas, Center Stage. Scobie concluded that, given voter attitudes at the time, no woman could have won that race. Scobie stated that Nixon's tactics, which used voter anger at communists, contributed to the magnitude of Douglas's defeat, as did the fragmentation of the California Democratic Party in 1950, the weakness of Roosevelt at the head of the ticket, Douglas's idealistic positions (to the left of many California Democrats) and Boddy's attacks. In his early biography of Nixon, Mazo contrasted the two campaigns and concluded, \\"when compared with the surgeons of the Nixon camp, the Douglas operators performed like apprentice butchers\\". Both Roger Morris and Greg Mitchell (who wrote a book about the 1950 race) conclude that Nixon spent large sums of money on the campaign, with Morris estimating $1‚Äì2 million (perhaps $12 million‚Äì$24 million today) and Mitchell suggesting twice that. Gellman, in his later book, conceded that Nixon's officially reported amount of $4,209 was understated, but indicated that campaign finance law at that time was filled with loopholes, and few if any candidates admitted to their full spending. He considered Morris's and Mitchell's earlier estimates, though, to be \\"guess[es]\\" and \\"fantastic\\". Black suggests that Nixon spent about $1.5 million and Douglas just under half of that. Scobie summed up her discussion of Douglas's defeat, > As an actress, she entered Broadway as a star on sheer talent and little > training ... [As an opera singer], she sang abroad for two summers, fully > expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera. In politics > after five months of working with the [California Democratic] Women's > Division, it seemed only natural that she head the state's organization and > serve as Democratic National Committeewoman. Restless after three years in > those positions, she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as > a logical next step. Only four years later, she felt ready to run for the > Senate. But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on > political issues, along with gender questions, eroded the support of the > Democratic Party in 1950. What in fact may have hurt her the most is that > for which she is most remembered‚Äîher idealism.

Mancino (born as Balogh Csaba in 1968 in Hungary), is a contemporary Abstract Expressionist Painter, Graphic Artist, Photographer, Actor, Director, Musician living in the United Kingdom England.  Biography  Jack C. Mancino was born in Hungary in 1968. He grew up in the riverside industrial small town called Leninvaros (Tiszaujvaros) (eastern region of Hungary). He was ten when he started to study art painting, graphical portrait, graphical landscapes drawing. At the beginning of his study, he liked to copying art paintings using oil and acrylic paint that helped him to get the very important basic techniques. In 1980 at age of 12, he moved to (Halle Neustadt) Germany with his family. That short period of time he made improvement in the study of graphical drawing and acrylic painting due to copying comic book themes to sketchbooks and posters. When the family moved back to Hungary he felt that he wanted to make a major improvement in art but there was insufficient support by the local art teachers. Until 17 he lived in Hungary studying in an Industrial engineering school learning drafting in mechanical drawing. In 1986 he moved back to north Germany. He worked in a nuclear power plant in the northern seaside region where he got a big impact by the different land and seascapes. He remembered: \\"I was watching the sea all day long and I almost lost my job because of it\\". At that time due to plenty of working hours he was unable to focus on artistic activity. He spent a year in Germany when he moved to Canada (Toronto). He learned that the art themes on canvas were totally different in the western world compared to the art that was promoted in the communist era. Later he stated: \\"There was a style what was so free with its own system of rules\\". He started to learn more about abstract and surrealism. The modern art gave him a new tunnel of viewpoints and of color usage. (Kandinsky, Picasso, Rothko). When he moved back to Hungary he still studied art and graphics with commercial design, mechanical drawing but in the same time, he got involved with the heavy industrial business to focus on industrial maintenance and structure building in the chemical and oil industry. When he sold his heavy industrial company at 30 he moved back to Canada ( Toronto) There he started to make progression with more focus on art by studying more about abstract expressionism and surrealism. Since 2005 he lives in the UK (England). He stated:\\"I finally find my own style, within the modern abstract expressionism. I try to archive situations, shapes, fields, feelings, urban themes as abstractions with vibrant colorization with my own naive and raw shapes. I'm actually unable to specify my own style. Right now I\`m very much in love with Abstract expressionism.\\"  Work  Art = No. 9 in Fragmented geometry series \\"A\\" Mancino's work in abstract expressionism and suprematism is mainly based on artworks of earlier abstract expressionists from the early and middle of the 20th century. His earliest work comprised classical landscapes and still life compositions but his later work focused on the art theories of abstract painters like Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.Fesz√ºlts√©g √©s szabads√°g Lisszabonban The change helped him establish his own artistic style within abtract expressionism. Since then he has followed the New York School of abstract expressionism . The technical elements of his art theory show the balanced application of either precise or raw objects relations. The communicative compositions are systemically related with impulsive color surroundings; the artistic application of his works are also characterized by strong vibrant colorization and raw geometrical shape composition or structuring. The use of geometrical shapes reflect Suprematism, although he preferred to call his style \\"Fragmented Geometrical Abstract.\\" Mancino's \\"A\\" collection began around 1992; his \\"B\\" collection series started after 2000.  Early classical stage In his early years, he made study on Hungarian classical artists works such as Mihaly Munkacsy and Laszlo Paal. At the beginning of his career he was mostly influenced by classical and surreal (Dal√≠) themes. At his classical landscape or still life pieces, the viewer can easily recognize the prominent modern contemporary elements such as vivid colorization and wild, raw brush strokes, abstract or geometrical balance, as well as the degree of elaboration of objects and crudity. In his earlier works, the use of vivid color surroundings point out to his later style and also shows his vibrant personality. One of the great examples of this feature is the Blue Bay, and The Hungarian Plain series. The colors of the scene of the Great Hungarian Plain show modern abstraction features that are not used by the classical painters in their realistic color settings. The dynamic usage of colors gives a new styled appearance and lends a touch of abstract style in the classic landscape theme.  Change to Abstract  No. 16 in Fragmented geometry series \\"B\\" Keeping his respect towards classical art in 1987 he changed the focus on his art interest in Canada. In the western culture styled world surroundings started to look out for more color and different concepts in art. He started to recognize themes and conceptions in the abstract and abstract expressionism using more color and more geometric relations than he used in his classical art progression. According to him, \\"Every artist reaches the target only when they are able to give the viewer something in emotion and emotion is not a subject of mastered complexity or definition of school degree or details\\". His basic ‚Äì and always kept in mind ‚Äì principle that is actually \\"Schools often prevent the individual mind to create something genuine\\". Following the American abstract expressionist's free theory, in his creations, the viewer can recognize large color space conceptions and also some kind of unschooled freedom. In his art, the elaboration and vibrant color combination create subliminal communication. The application of mostly basic shape conception and color relation creates a clear and firm unique style seen by outside observers, although some modern contemporary art collectors compare his work to Jean-Michel Basquiat. = Film = Mancino turned to film-making in 2013 as director and actor in the independent film The Seventh Page, which was released in 2018. The movie is a romantic, comical adventure about a bohemian boxer in 1940s New York City who is involved in an illegal boxing match bet which accidentally leads to a wild adventure in World War II Europe to steal the plans for a machine capable of destroying the world.

Columbus landed on one of the islands of the Bahamas in 1492 which he named San Salvador.

He served as a Member of Parliament in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Freedom fighter He took part in the Quit India Movement and was imprisoned for it. He also took part in the Goa Liberation Movement and the Civil Disobedience Movement launched by Ram Manohar Lohia in Goa in 1946. The Portuguese colonial administration deported him and kept him in detention. After being released from detention in Portugal in 1956 , Kakodkar came back to India. After spending some time with his family in Mumbai, he came to Goa and set up an ashram in Margao. The ashram was used to disguise the freedom movement and many freedom fighters took refuge in the ashram. The police soon discovered the true purpose of the ashram and closed it. He was among the vocal critics of the Salazar administration in Goa. In 1961, he pursued autonomy for Portuguese India but without success. After Goa's liberation Kakodkar was the head of the Goa unit of the Congress, which was set up in Panjim from the residence of his close confidant and advisor Advocate Rui Gomes Pereira. Gomes Pereira was considered to be Goa's foremost legal counsel and an astute politician. Contribution to the Goa Opinion Poll When the issue of Goa's merger with Maharashtra came up, Kakodkar was the chairperson of the Goa Pradesh Congress committee. He used his personal equations with the Nehru family to lobby hard for a referendum with the central leadership. According to one source, he reportedly \\"almost lost his sanity\\" trying to do so against the mighty Maharastra. Political career He served as Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha(lower house), representing Panaji constituency in the former union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu from 1971 to 1977. He was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha from 1985 to 1991. During this term he was also a member of Committee on Petitions, Rajya Sabha during 1986-87. Criticism In his book Panthast, Goan writer Ravindra Kelekar blamed the failure of the non-violent Goa Freedom Movement, spearheaded by Lohia on the squabbles and ego-clashes between Kakodkar and Ram Hegde. Kelekar also stated that Kakodkar was once responsible for Mahatma Gandhi having to apologise to the Portuguese. While he was logged in Aguada jail, Kakodkar had begun a fast against the harassment meted out by the Portuguese authority to the freedom fighters. Gandhiji had made a note of this in his paper Harijan. The Portuguese replied that Kakodkar was not fasting. Gandhiji is supposed to have sent a man, who was a relative of Kakodkar, to verify this. His relative verified that although Kakodkar was not taking any food from the jail, he was getting food from outside. A shocked Gandhi tendered an apology to the Portuguese through the Harijan.

Yedinstvo was supported by the Soviet military and the KGB. In addition to ethic Russians, the organization had some success among the Polish minority in Lithuania, many of whom preferred Lithuania as a member of the Soviet Union. Yedinstvo went as far as to support forming a Polish autonomous region in southeastern Lithuania. Some commentators suggested that the organization was more popular with the Polish minority than the Russophone minority of Lithuania, which might have surprised the Poles of Warsaw, then seeking a de-communization in Poland. At the election to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, two Poles were elected to that body, both pro-Moscow. The movement lost influence after the August Coup, which its leaders had supported.

It can be used to make ornaments and sculptures, and can be dried in the oven or microwave. It can be sealed using varnish or polyurethane, and can be painted with acrylic paint, or coloured using food colouring, natural colouring, or paint mixed in with the flour or water. Properly mixed dough does not crumble or crack. It is a dense, and hence heavy, material, which can cause issues with large designs. It can be moulded by hand, without using special tools or fixtures, and it does not stain hands. More complex sculptures can be made using basic tools. It is commonly used to make simple sculptures such as apples, leaves, or mushrooms, or more complex shapes such as trees, birds and animals. It is often used to make Christmas decorations or birthday gifts, souvenirs, or in spring rituals in Eastern Europe, and sometimes for weddings and winter rituals.

The official name of this festival was first \\"the International Educational Film Festival\\"; and the Persian word \\"jashnv√¢re\\", meaning \\"something like a feast\\", was coined and used first in Persian to call this kind of event and eventually this word became the standard Persian translation of the word \\"festival\\". From the 20th festival on, the official name of the festival turned into its current name, i.e. \\"Roshd International Educational Film Festival\\". For the first time in 1993, Roshd International Film Festival was staged simultaneously in Tehran and the city of Bandarabbas, the center of Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. From 1993 up until 2001, the festival was staged every year, simultaneously in Tehran and other provinces of Iran. Since 2001, Tehran is the only host of Roshd International Film Festival and the Provincial Roshd Film Festivals have been staged periodically but not simultaneously in other provinces.  Objectives The main objectives of Roshd International Film festival are as follows: Identifying, choosing, and introducing the best educational and pedagogical films in order to encourage the Iranian and foreign film makers who are active in the field of educational films and promote artistic and cultural interactions among them. By triggering intercommunication among the educational film makers, Roshd Film Festival seeks to improve the quality and quantity of the educational films produced in the I.R.Iran.

The organisation helps young people who are neglected by South Africa's education system. http://www.saep.org http://www.causes.com/saep  Beneficiaries  Philippi, the township community in which SAEP works, is a historically disadvantaged, under- resourced community. Like many townships in Cape Town, Philippi faces many social problems, including poor education, violent crime, substance abuse, environmental degradation and a rise in the number of residents with HIV/AIDS. It is a community which is severely impoverished, with the majority of residents living in informal wood and iron structures, typically without electricity or running water. Schools in Philippi are often overcrowded, with low pass rates, and are under-resourced with few extra-curricular activities available to students. Nearly half of working-age people are unemployed and only 32% of the population (20 years & older) has completed secondary school (Grade 12) or higher. The average household income is R3,200 or less, indicating that many residents hold low income jobs or live on social grants. Successful graduates often move away from the township, leaving learners with few role models and little motivation to challenge local job seeking behaviours or believe that they can make something of themselves. Lack of information, networks and opportunities trap many into continued poverty and under-productivity.  History  SAEP (USA) was founded in 1994 by Norton Tennille as a Cape Town based, US funded non-governmental organisation focusing on environmental education and awareness. In 1998, SAEP (USA) broadened its educational support activities to include after-school tutoring in core academic subject areas, including biology, mathematics, and English at Sinethemba Senior Secondary School in Philippi township, Cape Town. In 2003, SAEP (USA) and Jane Keen, a South African social worker, teamed up to form SAEP (SA), a sister organisation which was registered as a community-based South African Non-Profit Organisation that year and two years later became a registered Public Benefit Organisation. The same year, the Bridging Year Programme was started which aimed to assist school leavers in improving their English, developing computer skills and exploring career alternatives. Under the leadership of Jane Keen, SAEP began working with a cluster of ten educare centres to help them improve infrastructure, develop financial and administrative skills, and register with the Department of Social Development and Education. Arts had been a part of SAEP's high school programme in the form of poetry workshops since 2000, but in 2005 it became a programme in its own right. Visual arts, drama, photography and film were added that year, and music and other activities in subsequent years. In 2009 SAEP moved its high school academic programme from Grades 11 and 12 to Grade 9 with its launch of the Hope Scholars Programme, a holistic tutoring and mentoring programme designed to begin in Grade 9 and follow the learners through Grade 12. The same year SAEP also launched, in partnership with ADT Security, the ADT teach Programme, a three-year computer training programme designed to provide township learners in three high schools with IT skills necessary for the job market and for tertiary studies. Tertiary support was provided on an ad hoc basis from the time that the first Bridging Year students applied and were accepted to university. This was formalized in 2010 with the launch of the Tertiary Support Programme. Since 2006, SAEP had had a vision of creating a research and development hub or \\"think-and-do\\" tank but lacked funding for it. In 2011 it became a reality with a small three-year grant from the National Lottery. It grew considerably in 2013 thanks to funding from the STARS Foundation Impact Award for Education. SAEP recognized the importance of academic and career counseling at an early stage, and began a formal programme when it cofounded Inkanyezi in collaboration with its UCT partner organization TeachOut. In 2013, SAEP's social worker, who has experience and expertise in career counseling, developed this programme which has a focus on capacity building for high school life orientation teachers.  Awards  SAEP was awarded an 'impact award' by the international STARS Foundation in both 2012 and 2013. In 2012 SAEP received the regional runner-up award for excellent service provision and effective management. In 2013 SAEP received the 2013 Stars Runner Up Award for Education in Africa / Middle East. The Stars Awards recognize and reward effective, well-managed local organisations working to improve child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) in the countries with the highest under-five child mortality. Also in 2012, SAEP's Early Childhood Development Programme received a national Impumelelo Innovation Award for its replicable model and track record of poverty impact. The same year, Jane Keen, SAEP Director, was named one of the three national Education Finalists for the Shoprite Checkers Women of the Year Award in recognition of her lifelong commitment to improving the lives of marginalized children. In 2008, SAEP's Early Childhood Development Programme won an ABSA/Sowetan award as runner up Western Cape Resource Training Organization of the Year. Also in 2008, SAEP (USA)‚Äôs founder, Norton Tennille, won the national Inyathelo Award for Exceptional Philanthropy for his groundbreaking work in education in the schools of Philippi and neighbouring townships.  SAEP's Vision and Mission  SAEP‚Äôs vision is \\"A generation of motivated South African youth, equipped with education and life skills in order to maximise their potential, and contribute to society. SAEP's mission is \\"To prepare and motivate children and youth from under-resourced communities to thrive by providing education, life skills and psycho-social support\\" through its learning programmes.  SAEP‚Äôs Objectives  SAEP's overall organizational objectives are: * To increase access to quality early childhood education in township communities; * To significantly improve academic achievement in township high schools; * To expand the horizons of, build the confidence of, and empower township youth through career guidance and enrichment programmes; * To enhance the likelihood of tertiary entrance and retention among township youth and to improve tertiary graduation rates among these youth; * To share knowledge and collaborate with other organisations working for change in South African education, and together advocate for improved service delivery in the sector.  SAEP Programmes (from 2019)  SAEP employs a community-driven approach. All the programmes have developed in response to specific needs expressed by learners, teachers or principals in the Philippi community. The offerings include: * The Early Childhood Development Programme, works with under-resourced centres in Philippi through centre capacitation and compliance in order for them to be recognised and be registered by the Department of Social Development. The ECD Programme help the educare centres develop into sustainable, quality education providers through long-term mentoring relationships, ongoing staff training, provision of educational materials and guidance, and infrastructural and nutritional support. This impacts 0 to 5 year old children. * The Hope Scholars Programme, helps Grade 8 and 9 learners transition into secondary school through extended experiential learning, career guidance, and mentoring & enrichment activities. This impacts trades 8 and 9 learners from partner schools. * The Bridging Year Programme, prepares promising recent matriculants for success in tertiary education through intensive tutoring on 21st century skills, critical thinking, career advisement, and life orientation. The programme also provides leadership training, computer and digital literacy skills and psycho-social support. This impacts post-matric students, all of whom are from under-resourced schools. SAEP has partnered with the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Second Chance Programme for the students' subject rewrite of their previous matric results. * The Tertiary Support Programme, which provides psycho-social counselling, financial support and professional career mentorship to promote tertiary retention and ensure success and completion in higher education. Prior to 2019, SAEP also ran the following programmes , but the programmes were terminated due to insufficient funding: * The ADT Teach Programme, which uses innovative mobile computer labs to teach advanced computerskills to secondary school learners in Grades 10-12. This used to be, in majority, funding by ADT Tyco South Africa. * The Arts Outreach Programme, which runs after-school workshops for primary and secondary school learners in a variety of artistic disciplines, including creative writing, visual art, drama, dance, and music, and takes participating learners on cultural excursions. * The Environmental Education Programme, which runs after-school environmental awareness clubs for secondary school learners. * The Career Connections Programme, which trains Life Orientation teachers in career guidance, supports schools to develop career resource libraries, and provides direct career guidance to Grade 9 and 11 learners with the help of trained peer mentors.  The Impact Centre: Monitoring & Evaluation, and the Impact Centre Consulting  SAEP has an Impact Centre, a research and development hub, which supports and develops the educational programmes and contributes to the broader conversation on education in South Africa. The Impact Centre is also responsible for the monitoring and evaluation reporting for the entire organisation. In 2016, SAEP established the Impact Centre Consulting, its sustainability arm to help generate unrestricted income revenue stream for the organisation by developing monitoring and evaluation modules for small to medium size organisations using cloud-based CRM, Salesforce.

It features Chris Cutler, Tim Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper from the English avant-rock group Henry Cow, singer and musician Robert Wyatt, and poet Adrian Mitchell. The cover artwork was done by British cartoonist and caricaturist Ralph Steadman. All monies raised from the sale of the record, less the manufacturing costs, were given to the Miners Strike Fund. The artists, studio, record company and distributors waived their fees.EP liner notes Background The project was initiated by Chris Cutler from Henry Cow, who enlisted the services of ex-band members Tim Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper. Also included was Robert Wyatt, who had performed with Henry Cow on several occasions, and Bill Gilonis who was from Hodgkinson's current band at the time, the Work. The album, a 12-inch EP, was recorded at Hodgkinson's Cold Storage studios in Brixton, London, and was released on Cutler's own Recommended Records independent record label. Recording \\"Moments of Delight\\" and \\"In the Dark Year\\" are two songs composed for this album by Tim Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper respectively, with texts by Chris Cutler. They were performed by Cooper, Hodgkinson, Cutler and Bill Gilonis, with Robert Wyatt singing, and were recorded on 29‚Äì31 October 1984 at Cold Storage. \\"Back in the Playground Blues\\" and \\"On the Beach at Cambridge\\" are two poems by Adrian Mitchell from his book, On the Beach at Cambridge: New Poems (1984). Mitchell recites the poems, which were recorded on 21 October 1984 at Cold Storage. \\"Bittern Storm Revisited\\" is a remix of Henry Cow's \\"Bittern Storm over √úlm\\" from their 1974 album, Unrest. It was remixed in 1984 at Cold Storage. Reception Eugene Chadbourne in a review of the album at AllMusic called it an \\"expertly produced release\\". He said that it will appeal to fans of Henry Cow, who might also complain of the EP's brevity. Chadbourne remarked that it \\"all goes by very quickly\\", and likened it to \\"a greeting card with some inspired verse scribbled on it\\".

Standing originally for Distributed Resource System, the full name was later dropped in favour of the abbreviation. During the mid-1980s separate Office Systems business units had produced a disparate range of products including IBM-compatible PCs such as the PWS (a PC/AT clone), small servers branded DRS, and various larger Unix servers sold under the Clan range. A rebranding in late 1988 pulled these together under the DRS brand, with a consistent mid-grey and peppermint-green livery. The ICL division responsible for these systems eventually became part of the Fujitsu-Siemens joint venture.  DRS 20/100/200  An ICL DRS20 terminal The original DRS was the DRS 20 produced in Utica, New York and launched in September 1981. This ran the proprietary DRX (Distributed Resource Executive) operating system. The basic 'intelligent terminal' (model 10/110/210) used 8-bit 8085 processors (workstation, application and network processors), each with between 32 KB and 128 KB of memory. The Model 210 also had an 80188 application processor with 512 KB to run CP/M. The larger models 20 and 40 had floppy disk drives. The floor-standing models 50, 150, and 250 had hard disks, from which diskless models booted. In early models, these were 8\\" floppy disks, and later 5¬º\\" disks. The diskless model, that partnered the DRS 20, was the DRS 10\\\\. It had 10 KB available for applications programs developed in CIS COBOL. Up to 16 DRS 20/DRS 10 machines could be connected via LAN with the addresses being set by DIP switches on the rear of the unit. The LAN was formed via 93 Ohm coaxial cable in a bus formation running at 1.25 Mbps. The final model 310 (styled like a DRS 300 module) had a second 80186 application processor with 1 MB RAM to run Concurrent DOS, emulating an IBM PC with a Hercules screen display.  DRS 300  In the mid-1980s ICL developed the DRS 300 in Kidsgrove, and ran down Utica. Launched in 1986, DRS 300 was a modular system consisting of A4-sized units designed to be placed on an office bookshelf. Modules containing a power supply (Kx), processor (Ax), hard and floppy disks (Dx), streamer tape (Sx) etc. were connected by SCSI. Initial models used a 6 MHz 80286 processor (A1 module) with up to 1 MB memory. Later modules used an 8 MHz processor (A2) or 80286 with 80287 maths coprocessor (A3) with up to 4 MB, and ran Concurrent CP/M-86 and later Concurrent DOS. Although this could run code developed under CP/M, PC DOS or MS-DOS, in practice available applications were limited because many shrink-wrapped packages developed for the IBM PC made use of direct access to the (IBM) hardware. This was addressed through use of softclone technology to intercept such calls. However, this required the continual release of patches for new application versions. The initial DRS 300 also ran ICL's implementation of Unix System V Release 2, DRS/NX V2. Later an 80386 (A4) module was added, to run a 32-bit DRS/NX V3, based on System V Release 3\\\\.  DRS 400, DRS 500  These brand names were applied to bought-in Unix boxes. The DRS 400 originated as the Clan 4, based on the Motorola 68020 running UniSoft's Uniplus Unix. This was later replaced by the DRS 400E, based on the Motorola 68030 running DRS/NX V3. DRS 500 originated as the Clan 5, 6 and 7 based on the CCI Power 6/32. This was built in Irvine by CCI, which had been taken over by ICL's parent STC PLC. CCI was also the source of what became ICL's flagship OfficePower office application suite across the DRS range.  DRS 3000  The successor to DRS 300, the DRS 3000 was an IBM-compatible, 80486-based, floor-standing model running SVR4. The P5 Pentium-based Level 656 was launched in September 1993.New Pentium Processor System for Unix, Product Matters Issue 3 September 1993, International Computers Ltd, Bracknell  DRS 6000  The in-house (Irvine/Bracknell) developed DRS 6000 was launched in January 1990 as a washing machine-sized SPARC-based server, running ICL's implementation of Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4). It also had a 68020-based Central Service Module board (CSM), leading to sarcastic comments in the press that it was a DRS 400 in disguise. By 1992 there were desktop, slimline and full sized models, ranging from a single-processor desktop model rated at 29 MIPS (L240) to a 4-processor model rated at 116 MIPS (L644). Some models were sold by Fujitsu as the DS/90. ICL received the Queen's Award for Export Achievement for DRS 6000 in 1993. The DRS 6000 competed directly with IBM's RS/6000, which was launched a few weeks later; originally planned to be called the DRS 600 it was renamed when it was found that IBM had decided on the RS 6000. In 1994, the DRS range was superseded by the SuperServer (Ks (SPARC) and Ki (Intel)) and TeamServer (Es (1-2 SPARC CPUs), Hs (2-4 SPARC CPUs), Ei (1 x86 CPU), Hi (2 x86 CPUs)) ranges of SPARC and Intel-based machines, running DRS/NX Unix or Microsoft Windows NT. * DRS 6000 Level 200 Series Model 240: Cabinet type: Compact Desktop Processor 1 x 40 MHz SCSI Channels 1 Floppy disk (fmt) 720 KB & 1.44 MB Disk 1 x 520 MB Specifications: Processor \\\\- Type SPARC/RISC \\\\- Word Length 32 bits \\\\- Cache 64 KB \\\\- Cache configuration 64 KB (2 KB x 32) direct mapped Memory \\\\- Size (module) 8 MB, 16 MB \\\\- Size (max) 96 MB \\\\- Access time 80 ns Mbus \\\\- Cycle time 25 ns \\\\- Data path width 64 bits \\\\- Memory slots 6 pairs \\\\- Transfer rate 320 Mbyte/sec Sbus \\\\- Slots 5 \\\\- Cycle time 40 ns \\\\- Data path width 32 bits \\\\- Transfer rate 100 Mbyte/sec * DRS 6000 Level 600 Series Model 630: Cabinet Type: Midi Processor: 1 x 33 MHz Performance: 23 MIPS SCSI Channels: 2 Disks: 1 x 660 MB Model 632: Cabinet Type: Midi Processor: 2 x 33 MHz Performance: 46 MIPS SCSI Channels: 2 Disks: 1 x 660 MB Model 640: Cabinet Type: Midi Processor: 1 x 40 MHz Performance: 29 MIPS SCSI Channels: 2 Disks: 1 x 660MB Model 642: Cabinet Type: Midi Processor: 2 x 40 MHz Performance: 58 MIPS SCSI Channels: 2 Disks: 1 x 660 MB Model 644: Cabinet Type: Midi Processor: 4 x 40 MHz Performance: 116 MIPS SCSI Channels: 2 Disks: 1 x 660 MB Specifications: Processor \\\\- Type SPARC/RISC \\\\- Word Length 32 bits \\\\- Cache 128 KB \\\\- Cache configuration 16 KB x 64 direct mapped Memory \\\\- Size (module) 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB \\\\- Size (max) 512 MB \\\\- Transfer rate 66 Mbyte/sec (reads) 88 Mbyte/sec (writes) Disk \\\\- Size 5.25\\" \\\\- Max 8 GB (main cabinet) 29 GB (with expansion cabinets) HSPbus \\\\- Cycle time 60 ns \\\\- Data Path Width 64 bits \\\\- Slots 9 \\\\- Transfer rate 133 Mbytes/sec VMEbus \\\\- Slots 11 (main cabinet) 31 (with 2 expansion cabinets) \\\\- Throughput 40 Mbyte/sec (Sources: Product description glossy's)  DRS PWS  In 1987, the DRS Professional Work Station (PWS) was ICL's first foray into IBM PC/AT compatible computing. The DRS PWS was initially released with MS-DOS 4.0 (not to be confused with the later public releases of IBM DOS 4.0 in July 1988 and MS-DOS 4.01 in November 1988). This was a real-mode pre-emptive multitasking version of MS-DOS 2.0 and was also the forerunner of OS/2. It was soon replaced with MS-DOS 4.1 when this became available; this was written especially for the DRS PWS, but was not finished for the launch. Microsoft agreed to write a custom version of MS-DOS 4.0 for ICL that would take advantage of the extra memory on the ICL computers. As a consequence, PWS users had a number of software compatibility challenges, although the PC Business Unit (PCBU) at ICL BRA04, in Bracknell, did patch some applications for larger customers. The PWS was positioned to compete with the IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2) and the DEC Vaxstation 2000. In 1988, the DRS PWS and DRS PWS 386 were respectively rebranded as the DRS Model 60 and DRS Model 80\\\\. The PWS hardware was a large desktop or floor standing tower chassis, running on an Intel 8 MHz 80286 processor that was later superseded by an Intel 20 MHz 80386 (DRS PWS 386). Memory expansion was via proprietary cards (1 MB or 4 MB cards, 16 MB total) and initially there was no support for 1.44 MB High Density (HD) floppy drives, although a hardware modification to the clock lines on the floppy disk controller meant that later versions of the PWS could be upgraded. The ENGA (EGA compatible video) controller, displayed standard EGA graphics and text with an additional line reserved on the bottom row for multitasking and communications task messages. The PWS was capable of communicating with ICL departmental and mainframe services using a combination of Microlan2 and OSLAN (Open Systems Local Area Network) protocols. Microsoft and OSLAN network connectivity was supported via BICC OSLAN cards (OSLAN being ICL's implementation of OSI transport protocols over Ethernet). TCP/IP and DECnet support was implemented by third parties using packet drivers, as NDIS was not available at this time.  Development software  Languages on DRS 20 under DRX included Microsoft BASIC, Micro Focus CIS-COBOL, Pascal, 8085 Assembler, and application building packages including Userbuild and the Demon suite. Languages on DRS 300 Concurrent DOS included Lattice C, CBASIC, Micro Focus Level II COBOL and Digital Research languages including FORTRAN and Pascal. Development software on the Unix-based DRS ranges (300 to 6000) included C, Micro Focus and RM COBOL, EPC C++, FORTRAN and Pascal, and relational databases including Ingres, Informix, Oracle, Sybase and Progress 4GL supplied by Progress Software. During this period, ICL's software strategy was increasingly to make available on its own hardware popular software packages developed by third parties. Almost invariably this involved porting the source code, as there was insufficient compatibility between machines at the binary level. In order to reduce the cost of this activity, and the commercial disadvantage of not having as large a software portfolio as rival vendors, ICL invested strenuous efforts to improve cross-industry compatibility through initiatives such as X/Open.

Like several other divisions in the 320-330 series, it was neither fully trained nor equipped when thrown into the Soviet winter counteroffensive as part of 10th Army, but did its part in throwing back the forces of German Army Group Center from the southern approaches to Moscow in December and January. Over the course of five months of nearly continual offensive combat the soldiers of the division distinguished themselves sufficiently to be re-designated as the 31st Guards Rifle Division. A few months later a new 328th was formed, this time in the Transcaucasus Military District as the German summer offensive of 1942 was producing a crisis in that region. This new division had a slow start, but eventually proved itself in fighting through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, gaining a battle honor for the liberation of Warsaw, and helping to complete the encirclement of Berlin in April 1945. Despite this record, it was disbanded shortly after the German surrender.  1st Formation  The 328th Rifle Division began forming in the Yaroslavl area of the Moscow Military District on August 26, 1941.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 78 Its first commander, Col. Pyotr Antonovich Yeremin, was appointed the same day. At the time it was formed the personnel of the division were noted as being 90 percent of Russian nationality.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 The basic order of battle of the division was as follows: *1103rd Rifle Regiment *1105th Rifle Regiment *1107th Rifle Regiment *889th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 78 The division was assigned to 10th Reserve Army in October, which deployed to confront the advance of forces of German Army Group Center against Moscow's southern flank. On November 29 the 328th had reached the area of Turlatovo and Vygorodok. At this time it was in better shape than many other divisions in its Army, being outfitted with its main types of weapons, while still lacking certain weaponry and motor transport. Just prior to the start of the Soviet counteroffensive on December 5 the division was at Redino. On the next day the Army was subordinated to Western Front and ordered to attack in the direction of Mikhailov and Stalinogorsk.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 =Battle of Moscow= The joint attack on Mikhailov began on December 6; the 328th fought east of the town while the 330th and 323rd Rifle Divisions moved to bypass it from the north and southeast respectively. On December 10 and 11, Western Front ordered 10th Army to continue its advance towards Plavsk, and the Army further ordered its right-flank divisions, including the 328th, to reach the line Uzlovaya station - Bogoroditsk - Kuzovka by the morning of December 12. On the 11th the division reached the Don River along the Bobriki - Mikhailovka sector, encountering strong resistance, which was broken by December 13. During this first stage of the offensive the 328th had advanced at a rate of about nine km per day. On the morning of the 14th the offensive resumed and the 328th and 330th both crossed the Uzlovaya - Bogoroditsk railroad and continued attacking to the west. Plavsk was occupied, and the next objectives for 10th Army were the towns of Belyov and Kozelsk. By the end of December 21 the division had reached the sector Korenevka - Bulandino. As of December 25 it had been subordinated to 1st Guards Cavalry Corps and was moving towards the Oka River in support of the Corps' attack on Belyov.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 December 27 found the division advancing north of Belyov, fighting elements of the German 112nd and 167th Infantry Divisions covering the town in that direction. Two days later the division was re-subordinated directly to 10th Army, and began bypassing enemy strongpoints, moving along the route Pashkovo - Karacheevo to get into the flank and rear of the German Belyov grouping. On December 30 it began its direct assault on the town and played the leading role in its liberation, with help from the 330th and 322nd Rifle Divisions. The next day, as the latter unit mopped up Belyov, the 328th and 330th continued advancing west and northwest, but were soon redirected to the Kozelsk area as 10th Army consolidated. In the first days of January 1942, the Army was directed to cut the Vyasma - Bryansk railroad and liberate several towns, including Kirov and Zhizdra.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 As this new phase of the counteroffensive began on January 5 the 328th was held in 10th Army's second echelon in the Kozelsk area, and then was to move to Mekhovoe, where the Army headquarters was located. The division had taken heavy casualties in the fight for Belyov, and was now serving as the Army reserve. 324th Rifle Division was blockading the town of Sukhinichi in mid- January, and the depleted 328th was the only force available to reinforce the siege lines as the Germans were also reinforced. German Army Group Center began to receive reinforcements from occupied France which allowed them to launch a counterattack to relieve its besieged troops on January 18. Part of the Sukhinichi garrison was extracted by the German relief force and the town was finally liberated on January 29. Fighting by both sides persisted into February with mixed success.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8 Later that month the 328th was transferred to 16th Army, in the same Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 45 and it continued fighting in the area of Sukhinichi over the next few months. On April 7, Colonel Yeremin handed his command over to Col. Porfirii Martinovich Gudz, who would lead the division for the remainder of its 1st formation. On May 24, for its courage and heroism the division was redesignated as the 31st Guards Rifle Division.  2nd Formation  The GLAVKOM (High Command) issued an order on July 29, 1942, that the division was to be reformed,Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 116 and this began on August 4, at Beslan and Ordzhonikidze in the Transcaucasus Military District. Its first commander, Col. Nikolai Ivanovich Petunin, was assigned on the same date. Its basic order of battle remained the same as the 1st formation, with the following additions: *295th Antitank Battalion *606th Sapper Battalion *388th Reconnaissance Company *446th Signal Company *404th Chemical Defense Company *411th Medical/Sanitation BattalionSharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 124 At the time it was formed the division was noted as having 50 - 60 percent personnel of Caucasian nationalities, mostly Armenian.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, p. 594 =Battle of the Caucasus= At the time the STAVKA was reacting to the advances by German Army Group A into the Caucasus region. The new 66th Army was to be formed from Soviet forces already in the Terek River valley and additional forces from Transcaucasus Front, including the 328th when it was ready for service. As the panzers continued advancing towards Mozdok on August 23 further orders arrived to form a new 24th Army to defend the Makhachkala region, consisting of the 328th, 337th and 317th Rifle Divisions, the Makhachkala NKVD Rifle Division and the 3rd Rifle Brigade; further orders a few days later redesignated this as 58th Army.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 418-19, 437-38, 575 In September the division was again reassigned, now to the 18th Army in the Black Sea Group of Forces.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 196 On September 23, the German 17th Army began an offensive (Operation Attika) through the high passes of the Caucasus mountains towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse. At this time the 328th was in 18th Army reserves, along with 11th Guards Cavalry Division, 145th Naval Infantry Regiment and 40th Motorized Rifle Brigade. The German attack made fairly slow progress through this difficult terrain, but by September 29 had made gains that forced command changes in the Soviet forces and the commitment of the 328th and the 40th Brigade to shore up 18th Army's center and right flank. Further instructions from the STAVKA on October 2 ordered: Meanwhile, the balance of the division was to continue to help defend the Khadyshenskii - Tuapse road. In the event this attack was preempted by a German attack on the day before, but the Soviet defenses brought the German advance to a halt on October 9, barely short of the road.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 564, 567-68 A renewal of the offensive on October 21 smashed the 408th Rifle Division and forced its remnants to break out and retreat; by this point 17th Army's leading troops were just 30km from their goal. On October 24 the Slovak Motorized Division of LVII Panzer Corps attacked westward north of the Tuapse road towards Mount Sarai, and captured it from 68th Rifle Brigade. However, a counterattack by the 328th and the 32nd Guards Rifle Division against the Slovaks' flanks broke up their advance, and the positions of the 68th Brigade were retaken. The complex fighting in this region went on until early November until it was brought to a halt by attrition, exhaustion, and the onset of winter weather.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 572-73 At the end of the year the division was withdrawn from 18th Army to the reserves of the Black Sea Group. On January 13, 1943, as the German forces withdrew from the Caucasus and the Red Army advanced, the 889th Artillery Regiment was \\"swapped\\" for the 687th Artillery Regiment from 236th Rifle Division. The regiment continued as the 687th until August, when it was redesignated back to the 889th. From February to May 1943, the division was in the reserves of North Caucasus Front, eventually being assigned to the new 10th Rifle Corps. It was in this Front and this Corps when it was assigned to 56th Army in May.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 124 Into Ukraine and Belarus On May 6, Colonel Petunin handed his command over to Col. Ivan Grigorevich Pavlovskii, who would remain in command for the duration of the war. This officer would go on to serve as Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Ground Forces from 1964 to 1980.

(For example; Paul uses the phrase \\"en Christo\\" as a synonym for a Christian (Romans 16:7) and the phrase \\"en emoi\\" to describe the intimate identification of Christ with the believer (Galatians 2:20).) According to the narrower sense of the phrase, used in Christian theology, union with Christ is a step in the ordo salutis (\\"order of salvation\\"), and the basis of the believer's justification.Philip Ryken, The Message of Salvation, BST (Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 2001): 186. In this sense, union with Christ follows faith and precedes adoption (Galatians 3:26-27). Augustus Strong describes it in this way: \\"union with Christ logically precedes both regeneration and justification; and yet, chronologically, the moment of our union with Christ is also the moment when we are regenerated and justified.\\"Augustus Strong, 'Union With Christ' monergism.com. Retrieved 24 May 2009. Historical interpretationsRoman Catholic= Traditional Roman Catholic theology centres the union with Christ in a substantial sense on the unity of the institutional church, past and present. \\"The communion of saints is the spiritual solidarity which binds together the faithful on earth, the souls in purgatory, and the saints in heaven in the organic unity of the same mystical body under Christ its head.\\"J. Sollier, 'The Communion of Saints' Catholic Encyclopedia. (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908) Retrieved 20 May 2009. Christians, according to Roman Catholic theology, are united to Christ through the sacraments.J.P. Baker 'Union with Christ,' New Dictionary of Theology (Downers Grove: IVP Academic, 1988): 698. =Reformed= In Reformed theology, union with Christ is understood to be a comprehensive category that runs through the entire doctrine of Salvation.Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 319. John Murray observes: \\"Union with Christ is a very inclusive subject. It embraces the wide span of salvation from the ultimate source in the eternal election of God to its final fruition in the glorification of the elect.\\"As cited in Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 320. Sinclair Ferguson distinguishes six categories of union with Christ. Union with Christ is federal or covenantal in the sense that Christ's obedience is accounted to believers. It is carnal or fleshly in the sense that Christ became incarnate and thus became one with humanity. Union with Christ is also a faith union in which by faith Christians depend on Christ for nourishment. It is a spiritual union because Christians are united to Christ by the agency of the Holy Spirit. It is an extensive union in that Christians are united with Christ in everything he has done, including his life, death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and session. It is finally a union of life because Christ lives in Christians and he is visible in their lives. As a step in the order of salvation, union with Christ was seen by John Calvin to be the basis for both justification and sanctification. Alister McGrath notes that while Martin Bucer suggested that justification causes (moral) regeneration, Calvin argued that \\"both justification and regeneration are the results of the believer's union with Christ through faith.\\"Alister E. McGrath, Reformation Thought: An Introduction (3rd ed; Oxford: Blackwell, 1999): 125. =Evangelical= Some Evangelicals see union with Christ as a discrete stage in the \\"order of salvation.\\"Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 323. The evangelical theologian William Shedd comments \\"The impartation of Christ's righteousness presupposes a union with him.\\"As cited in Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 324. Robert Dabney, while avoiding deification, said that the bond of the union is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 325. =Eastern Orthodox= Eastern Orthodox theology emphasizes the incarnation as the starting point for our union with Christ.Baker 'Union with Christ,' 698. \\"In Christ God becomes one with us in order to make us one with him; he stooped to take our nature, in order that we might be restored to become partakers of his nature.\\" Theological ContentBasis= In Christian theology the union of Christ is built on the a priori assumption of Adam's union with humanity (Romans 5:12-21).Robert Letham, The Work of Christ (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1993): 82. Also according to the Apostle Paul, Christ's death and resurrection is a prerequisite for believers to be identified with Christ (Romans 6:8-10).Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 329. In other words, the vicarious death of Jesus is the basis for incorporation into Christ.Demarest, The Cross and Salvation, 330. The New Testament teaches that union with Christ is precipitated by faith and baptism, i.e. we believe and are baptized \\"into\\" Christ (John 3:16, Romans 6:3). Both the apostle John and Paul employ the Greek preposition eis rather than en in these passages to convey the notion of union with Christ. The ESV Study Bible explains the use of this particular preposition in its note on John 11:25, \\"The preposition translated ‚Äúin‚Äù (Gk. eis) is striking, for eis ordinarily means ‚Äúinto,‚Äù giving the sense that genuine faith in Christ in a sense brings people ‚Äúinto‚Äù Christ, so that they rest in and become united with Christ. (This same expression is found in 3:16, 18, 36; 6:35; 7:38; 12:44, 46; 14:12; 1 John 5:10.)\\"English Standard Version Study Bible. Wheaton: Crossway, 2011. Print =Nature= There are a number of ways of describing the nature of the union with Christ. Roman Catholic theology holds that believers actually imbibe the physical body and blood of Christ when they partake in the Eucharist.Pohle, 'Eucharist,' http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05572c.htm Retrieved 21 May 2009. Reformed theology using the model of federal headship, where humanity is covenantally represented by Adam, sees Christians represented covenantally by Christ.Baker, New Dictionary of Theology, 698. Pietist theology see a union with Christ as mystical, \\"hidden\\" in the spiritual dimension.Baker, New Dictionary of Theology,' 699. Evangelical theology contains the idea of an experiential union, where Jesus having gone through life, death and resurrection, shares these experiences with believers.Baker, New Dictionary of Theology,' 698. Both Reformed and Evangelical theology acknowledges that union with Christ is the subjective application of God's objective work in Salvation.Michael Horton, 'Union with Christ' monergism.com. http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/questions/horton/union.html Retrieved 24 May 2009. In Protestant theology the phrase union with Christ means a mutual indwelling (John 14-15), of Christians and the triune God, without affirming that Christians are absorbed into God.Herman Ridderbos, 'Fundamental Structures: In Christ, With Christ' Paul: An Outline of His Theology. http://www.geftakysassembly.com/Articles/BiblicalExposition/InChristWithChrist.htm Retrieved 24 May 2009. Several biblical themes are expressed within concept of being \\"in Christ.\\" For example, the Old Testament notion of God dwelling among the Israelites (Exodus 25:8) is expressed by Jesus in the New Testament as the triune God dwelling with believers (John 14:23). Augustus H. Strong positively describes the nature of the believer's union with Christ with five adjectives.^ Strong, Augustus H. Systematic Theology. Valley Forge: Judson Press, 1907, p. 800-801 This union is: # An organic union - in which believers become members of Christ and enjoy a mutual, reciprocal dependence on Christ for life and He on them for expression (Eph. 5:29-30). # A vital union - in which Christ operates within believers as their life and becomes the dominating principle within them (Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:3-4). # A spiritual union - that is, a union originating from and sustained by the Holy Spirit in their spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; Eph 3:16-17). # An indissoluble union - that is, a union which, by virtue of Christ's eternal, divine, and incorruptible power and grace, can never be dissolved (Matt. 28:20; Rom. 8:39; Heb. 7:16). # An inscrutable union - that is, a divine and mystical union of knowledge- surpassing intimacy and value (Eph. 3:19; 5:32; Col. 1:27).

Biography A doctor of theology, he was 'garde' of the king's library and entered the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise aged 29. In 1663, he was one of the four founder members of the \\"Petite Acad√©mie\\", which later gave birth to the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres. In 1665, he edited the preface to the complete works of Guez de Balzac edited by Conrart. In 1674, he published a Trait√© de morale sur la valeur (Moral treatise on valour). He translated the Rhetorica (then thought to be by Cicero) and Sallust's Histories from Latin into French - Chapelain stated that Cassagne wrote \\"[in a] more natural than acquired [style], especially in the field of human lettersCited on the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise \\". Also a renowned preacher, he was cruelly mocked by Boileau in the latter's third Satire, referring to people squashed in to listen to the \\"sermons of Cassaigne\\" and those of Charles Cotin. As a poet, Cassagne took the side of the moderns in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. In 1668, he published a poem Sur la conqueste de la Franche-Comt√© (On the conquest of the Franche-Comt√©, during the War of Devolution) and in 1672 a Po√´me sur la guerre de Hollande (Poem on the war with Holland, referring to the Franco-Dutch War). Boileau commented on these poems: ::Chacun a d√©bit√© ses maximes frivoles, (Everyone has charged its maxims as being frivolous) ::R√©gl√© les int√©rests de chaque Potentat, (It rules on the interests of each potentate,) ::Corrig√© la Police, & r√©form√© l'Estat ; (It corrects the Police, and reforms the State ;) ::Puis de l√† s'embarquant dans la nouvelle guerre, (Then he embarks on a new war,) ::√Ä vaincre la Hollande, ou battre l'Angleterre. (To vanquish Holland, or beat England.) With failing health, Cassagne died aged only 46, possibly due (some said) to the grief this satire had caused.

Although Parraleta is known as Carcajolo Nero on Corsica Island (France), it has been proved that it is not a color mutation of Bariadorgia, which is also called Carcajolo Blanc. Distribution and Wines Appears to be produced only in DO Somontano, where its importance has declined from 22% of the planted area in 1975 to only 0.2% in 2002. It is reported to produce wines with good colour, structure, acidity and fragrance. Vine and Viticulture Parraleta is a low yielding variety H. Johnson & J.

It can be used to make varietal wine or blend most commonly with Moristel or Tempranillo. The wines usually have intense color, high phenol and acidity.

In Catholicism, the Miracle of Lanciano is a Eucharistic miracle which is alleged to have occurred in the eighth century in the city of Lanciano, Italy. According to tradition, a monk who had doubts about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist found, when he said the words of consecration at Mass, that the bread and wine changed into flesh and blood. The Catholic Church officially claims the miracle as authentic. The story is similar to the tradition known as the Mass of Saint Gregory, first recorded in the 8th century by Paul the Deacon. The event The alleged miracle is usually described roughly as follows: In the city of Lanciano, Italy, then known as Anxanum, some time in the 700s, a Basilian hieromonk was assigned to celebrate Mass at the monastery of St. Longinus. Celebrating in the Roman Rite and using unleavened bread, the monk had doubts about the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. During the Mass, when he said the Words of Consecration (\\"This is my body. This is my blood\\"), the priest saw the bread change into living flesh and the wine change into blood which coagulated into five globules, irregular and differing in shape and size. The alleged miracle was contemporaneously investigated and confirmed by the Church, though no documents from this investigation are extant. Church of San Francesco, Lanciano. Investigations Piazza Plebiscito, Lanciano, with the church of San Francesco. Various investigations have tried to assess the relics, with varying results with the development of scientific capabilities over the centuries. One set of measurements were made in 1574 by Archbishop Antonio Gaspar Rodr√≠guez who determined that \\"The blood divided into five unequal parts weighs as much all together as each does separately.\\" A 21st- century historian of science calls this \\"the miracle of the weights\\". Gerbertus is a journal devoted to the history of science in the middle ages. In 1971, the specimens were analyzed by Odoardo Linoli, a professor in anatomy and pathological histology as well as chemistry and clinical microscopy, and former head of the Laboratory of Pathological Anatomy at the Hospital of Arezzo. He published his results in Quaderni Sclavo di Diagnostica Clinica e di Laboratori in 1971. Linoli's analysis was confirmed in 1981 by Ruggero Bertelli, a retired professor of human anatomy at the University of Siena. According to Linoli's study, the flesh is human cardiac tissue of type AB. He said he found proteins in the blood in the same proportions as are found in the sero-proteic make-up of normal blood. Linoli found no trace of preservatives. Relics The Basilian monks kept custody of the elements until their departure in 1175. They were succeeded by Benedictine monks in 1176. The items were placed in different locations within the Church of St. Francis at Lanciano. They were kept in the Valsecca Chapel from 1636 until 1902 when they were relocated to a new altar. , the relics of this miracle are kept in the Church of San Francesco in Lanciano. In 2004 Pope John Paul II recalled visiting the relics there while a cardinal. They are displayed in a silver and glass reliquary made in Naples in 1713.

The figure illustrates the calibration process of leaching efficiency, which parameter is difficult to measure directly. Leaching requirement The leaching requirement may refer to: * The total amount of water required to bring the soil salinity from an initially high value down to an acceptable value in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. From figure 1 it is seen that 800 mm of water (or 8000 m3/ha) is required to bring the soil salinity down to 60% of its original value in the soil layer at 40 to 60 cm depth. When the salinity must be less than 60%, extrapolation of the leaching curve, the use of a leaching equation (see below) or a leaching model like SaltMod is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the additional leaching requirement. * The annual amount of percolation water (i.e. the extra amount of irrigation water on top of the crop consumptive use) required to conserve an acceptable salt balance of the soil in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. The ratio ::FL = Perc/Irr, where Perc = amount of required percolation water, and Irr = total amount of irrigation water, :is called leaching fraction, see also below. Leaching equation The downward limb of the leaching curves, as in figure 3, can be described with the leaching equation: *Ct = Ci + (Co - Ci) exp (-EL.T.Qp/Ws) where C = salt concentration, Ct = C in the soil at time T, Co = C in the soil at time T=0, Ci = C of the irrigation water, EL = leaching efficiency, Qp = average percolation rate through the soil, and Ws = water stored in the soil at field saturation.

They had previously selected James Dornan, their leader on Glasgow City Council, but on 12 July he announced that he was withdrawing as a candidate following allegations in the Sunday Herald over past financial difficulties. The Conservative Party selected Ruth Davidson, a journalist and broadcaster, as well as a Territorial Army volunteer and Sunday school teacher.

DeLongchamps was involved in the design of a new courthouse for Humboldt County, where the old courthouse had burned. As a result of resentment over assessments for the replacement in Winnemucca, the new Pershing County was created from part of Humboldt County and its seat established in Lovelock. DeLongchamps, as Supervising Architect for the State of Nevada, undertook the new Lovelock courthouse. The courthouse features a shallow Ionic portico on a raised basement backed by a plain rectangular mass. Behind this is the hexagonal main body of the courthouse, built with curving walls.

The mountain is located in the southern region of Vermont's Green Mountains. It is home to the Prospect Mountain Nordic Ski Area, which has the highest base elevation of any ski area in New England, accounting for its abundance of natural snow. Prospect Mountain can be counted on to provide a long season for cross-country skiing. Since the late 1930s, when Alex Drysdale opened the first rope tow on Prospect Mountain in Woodford, people have enjoyed its scenery and high terrain. William Morse, with a contract to rebuild Route 9 from Bennington, likely reopened Prospect in 1961‚Äì62 with a new 3,200 foot long T-Bar. With the new lift and vertical drop expanded to some 675 feet, Prospect Mountain became a mid-sized ski area. Morse sold the ski area to Bennington attorney Joseph Parks in October 1978. Night skiing and cross country skiing (the former Timberlane Trails touring center) operations were added for 1979‚Äì1980.https://www.newenglandskihistory.com/Vermont/prospectmtn.php Prospect Mountain has over 35 kilometers of expertly groomed ski trails, and offers excellent skiing to everyone from racers to families. Snowshoe and backcountry ski trails are available.https://skivermont.com/prospect-mountain- nordic-ski-center Joe Parks lobbied for the creation of a wilderness designation to preserve and protect the beaver meadows beyond the peak. The George D. Aiken Wilderness was named after the late Vermont senator George D. Aiken, a strong advocate of preservation and a leader in securing the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act of 1975.https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmfl/recarea/?recid=65141 Steve Whitham and Andrea Amodeo purchased the ski area from Joe Parks in 1991. After deciding to sell it, they worked with the Prospect Mountain Association (PMA) to transition ownership. PMA is primarily a volunteer organization that relies the energy and efforts of season pass holders and supporters. Steve Whitham is staying on as the Mountain Manager and is now an employee of PMA.https://prospectmountain.com/big-news/ PMA purchased the 144-acre property in the fall of 2018 and shortly thereafter conserved it with Vermont Land Trust.https://www.vlt.org/outdoors/prospect-mountain David Newell, president of the PMA, said the balance of the cost will come from a $450,000 donation from alumni of Williams College and a $285,000 grant from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, which is contingent upon approval for a preservation easement for the mountain portion of the land and completion of the PMA's capital campaign. Williams College Nordic ski teams have used Prospect Mountain for training and race events, as have Mount Anthony Union High School and Mount Greylock Regional High School in Williamstown, Mass. Prospect Mountain will now serve as the home base for the Williams Nordic team and host the college's winter carnival, Newell said, adding that the PMA has a nine- member board of directors, including four associated with the college.https://vtdigger.org/2018/09/23/local-nonprofit-buys-prospect- mountain-nordic-ski-center/ Office at the base of Prospect Mountain, Vermont References Category:Mountains of Vermont Category:Mountains of Bennington County, Vermont ","title":"Prospect Mountain (Vermont)"},{"id":"22860211","text":"Jawai is a river originating in Udaipur district in Aravalli Ranges, a tributary of the Luni River.

Rizzo last played for Petrarca, the club where he spent most of his career and where he made his debut in Serie A1 halfway through the 2000‚Äì01 season in a match against Viadana. He spent four years between 2014-2018 in England playing 38 times (scoring 2 tries) for Leicester Tigers. Career Rizzo was born in Dolo, province of Venice, but spent his early years living in Padua where he attended the Istituto professionale alberghiero Pietro d'Abano. He grew up playing for Petrarca alongside his younger brother Marco, of which he also was the captain for two seasons (2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09). With the reputation of being a solid and aggressive player, good in scrummage but who also loves playing ball in hand with surprising speed, Rizzo was seen as one of the best young Italian props. He has been capped by the Italy national rugby union team, making his debut playing 4 minutes against Australia in 2005.

Any combination of methods used to manage a company's business processes is BPM. Processes can be structured and repeatable or unstructured and variable. Though not required, enabling technologies are often used with BPM. It can be differentiated from program management in that program management is concerned with managing a group of inter-dependent projects. From another viewpoint, process management includes program management. In project management, process management is the use of a repeatable process to improve the outcome of the project. Key distinctions between process management and project management are repeatability and predictability. If the structure and sequence of work is unique, then it is a project. In business process management, a sequence of work can vary from instance to instance: there are gateways, conditions; business rules etc. The key is predictability: no matter how many forks in the road, we know all of them in advance, and we understand the conditions for the process to take one route or another. If this condition is met, we are dealing with a process. As an approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce and deliver value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other total quality management or continual improvement process methodologies. ISO 9000 promotes the process approach to managing an organization. > ...promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing > and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance > customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements.Source: clause 0.2 of > ISO 9001:2000 BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology.Managing Performance Through Business Processes, Dominique Thiault, As such, many BPM articles and scholars frequently discuss BPM from one of two viewpoints: people and/or technology. BPM streamlines business processing by automating workflows; while RPA automates tasks by recording a set of repetitive activities implemented by human. Organizations maximize their business automation leveraging both technologies to achieve better results. Definitions BPM Institute defined Business process management as: :: ...the definition, improvement, and management of a firm's end-to-end enterprise business processes in order to achieve three outcomes crucial to a performance-based, customer-driven firm: 1) clarity on strategic direction, 2) alignment of the firm's resources, and 3) increased discipline in daily operations. The Workflow Management Coalition, BPM.com and several other sources[The Complete Business Process Handbook Volume 1: 'Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM by Prof. August-Wilhelm Scheer, Henrik von Scheel, Prof. Mark von Rosing, et al. (Morgan Kaufmann, ) use the following definition: :: Business process management (BPM) is a discipline involving any combination of modeling, automation, execution, control, measurement and optimization of business activity flows, in support of enterprise goals, spanning systems, employees, customers and partners within and beyond the enterprise boundaries. The Association of Business Process Management Professionals defines BPM as: :: Business process management (BPM) is a disciplined approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, and control both automated and non-automated business processes to achieve consistent, targeted results aligned with an organization‚Äôs strategic goals. BPM involves the deliberate, collaborative and increasingly technology-aided definition, improvement, innovation, and management of end-to-end business processes that drive business results, create value, and enable an organization to meet its business objectives with more agility. BPM enables an enterprise to align its business processes to its business strategy, leading to effective overall company performance through improvements of specific work activities either within a specific department, across the enterprise, or between organizations. Gartner defines business process management as: :: \\"the discipline of managing processes (rather than tasks) as the means for improving business performance outcomes and operational agility. Processes span organizational boundaries, linking together people, information flows, systems, and other assets to create and deliver value to customers and constituents.\\" It is common to confuse BPM with a BPM suite (BPMS). BPM is a professional discipline done by people, whereas a BPMS is a technological suite of tools designed to help the BPM professionals accomplish their goals. BPM should also not be confused with an application or solution developed to support a particular process. Suites and solutions represent ways of automating business processes, but automation is only one aspect of BPM. Changes The concept of business process may be as traditional as concepts of tasks, department, production, and outputs, arising from job shop scheduling problems in the early 20th century. The management and improvement approach , with formal definitions and technical modeling, has been around since the early 1990s (see business process modeling). Note that the term \\"business process\\" is sometimes used by IT practitioners as synonymous with the management of middleware processes or with integrating application software tasks. Although BPM initially focused on the automation of business processes with the use of information technology, it has since been extended to integrate human-driven processes in which human interaction takes place in series or parallel with the use of technology. For example, workflow management systems can assign individual steps requiring deploying human intuition or judgment to relevant humans and other tasks in a workflow to a relevant automated system.\\"Automated workflows\\" http://www.automatedworkflows.com/services/custom-development/custom- automator-development/ More recent variations such as \\"human interaction management\\" are concerned with the interaction between human workers performing a task. , technology has allowed the coupling of BPM with other methodologies, such as Six Sigma. Some BPM tools such as SIPOCs, process flows, RACIs, CTQs and histograms allow users to: * visualize ‚Äì functions and processes * measure ‚Äì determine the appropriate measure to determine success * analyze ‚Äì compare the various simulations to determine an optimal improvement * improve ‚Äì select and implement the improvement * control ‚Äì deploy this implementation and by use of user-defined dashboards monitor the improvement in real time and feed the performance information back into the simulation model in preparation for the next improvement iteration * re-engineer ‚Äì revamp the processes from scratch for better results This brings with it the benefit of being able to simulate changes to business processes based on real-world data (not just on assumed knowledge). Also, the coupling of BPM to industry methodologies allows users to continually streamline and optimize the process to ensure that it is tuned to its market need.Coupling BPM with Six Sigma research on BPM has paid increasing attention to the compliance of business processes. Although a key aspect of business processes is flexibility, as business processes continuously need to adapt to changes in the environment, compliance with business strategy, policies, and government regulations should also be ensured. Gong, Y. and Janssen, M. (2011). From policy implementation to business process management: Principles for creating flexibility and agility. Government Information Quarterly, 29 (Supplement 1), Pages S61-S71, Elsevier. The compliance aspect in BPM is highly important for governmental organizations. BPM approaches in a governmental context largely focus on operational processes and knowledge representation. Apostolou, D., Mentzas, G., Stojanovic, L., Thoenssen, B., & Lobo, T. P. (2010). A collaborative decision framework for managing changes in e-Government services Government Information Quarterly, 28(1), Page 101-116, Elsevier. There have been many technical studies on operational business processes in the public and private sectors, but researchers rarely take legal compliance activities into account‚Äîfor instance, the legal implementation processes in public- administration bodies. Life-cycle Business process management activities can be arbitrarily grouped into categories such as design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization.Franz Bayer, Harald K√ºhn (ed.): \\"Prozessmanagement f√ºr Experten - Impulse f√ºr aktuelle und wiederkehrende Themen\\", Springer-lVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013 right =Design= Process design encompasses both the identification of existing processes and the design of \\"to-be\\" processes. Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it, alerts and notifications, escalations, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Whether or not existing processes are considered, the aim of this step is to ensure a correct and efficient new design. The proposed improvement could be in human-to-human, human-to-system or system-to-system workflows, and might target regulatory, market, or competitive challenges faced by the businesses. Existing processes and design of a new process for various applications must synchronize and not cause a major outage or process interruption. =Modeling= Modeling takes the theoretical design and introduces combinations of variables (e.g., changes in rent or materials costs, which determine how the process might operate under different circumstances). It may also involve running \\"what-if analysis\\"(Conditions- when, if, else) on the processes: \\"What if I have 75% of resources to do the same task?\\" \\"What if I want to do the same job for 80% of the current cost?\\". =Execution= Business process execution is broadly about enacting a discovered and modeled business process. Enacting a business process is done manually or automatically or with a combination of manual and automated business tasks. Manual business processes are human-driven. Automated business processes are software-driven. Business process automation encompasses methods and software deployed for automating business processes. Business process automation is performed and orchestrated at the business process layer or the consumer presentation layer of SOA Reference Architecture. BPM software suites such as BPMS or iBPMS or low-code platforms are positioned at the business process layer. While the emerging robotic process automation software performs business process automation at the presentation layer, therefore is considered non-invasive to and de-coupled from existing application systems. One of the ways to automate processes is to develop or purchase an application that executes the required steps of the process; however, in practice, these applications rarely execute all the steps of the process accurately or completely. Another approach is to use a combination of software and human intervention; however this approach is more complex, making the documentation process difficult. In response to these problems, companies have developed software that defines the full business process (as developed in the process design activity) in a computer language that a computer can directly execute. Process models can be run through execution engines that automate the processes directly from the model (e.g., calculating a repayment plan for a loan) or, when a step is too complex to automate, Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) provides front-end capability for human input.Dr. Larry Kerschberg INFS 770 ‚Äì Methods for Information Systems Engineering: Knowledge Management and E-Business Compared to either of the previous approaches, directly executing a process definition can be more straightforward and therefore easier to improve. However, automating a process definition requires flexible and comprehensive infrastructure, which typically rules out implementing these systems in a legacy IT environment. Business rules have been used by systems to provide definitions for governing behavior, and a business rule engine can be used to drive process execution and resolution. =Monitoring= Monitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes, so that information on their state can be easily seen, and statistics on the performance of one or more processes can be provided. An example of this tracking is being able to determine the state of a customer order (e.g. order arrived, awaiting delivery, invoice paid) so that problems in its operation can be identified and corrected. In addition, this information can be used to work with customers and suppliers to improve their connected processes. Examples are the generation of measures on how quickly a customer order is processed or how many orders were processed in the last month. These measures tend to fit into three categories: cycle time, defect rate and productivity. The degree of monitoring depends on what information the business wants to evaluate and analyze and how the business wants it monitored, in real-time, near real-time or ad hoc. Here, business activity monitoring (BAM) extends and expands the monitoring tools generally provided by BPMS. Process mining is a collection of methods and tools related to process monitoring. The aim of process mining is to analyze event logs extracted through process monitoring and to compare them with an ' process model. Process mining allows process analysts to detect discrepancies between the actual process execution and the a priori model as well as to analyze bottlenecks. Predictive Business Process Monitoring concerns the application of data mining, machine learning, and other forecasting techniques to predict what is going to happen with running instances of a business process, allowing to make forecasts of future cycle time, compliance issues, etc. Techniques for predictive business process monitoring include Support Vector Machines, Deep Learning approaches, and Random Forest. =Optimization= Process optimization includes retrieving process performance information from modeling or monitoring phase; identifying the potential or actual bottlenecks and the potential opportunities for cost savings or other improvements; and then, applying those enhancements in the design of the process. Process mining tools are able to discover critical activities and bottlenecks, creating greater business value.S-Cube Knowledge Model: Business Process Optimization. =Re-engineering= When the process becomes too complex or inefficient, and optimization is not fetching the desired output, it is usually recommended by a company steering committee chaired by the president / CEO to re-engineer the entire process cycle. Business process reengineering (BPR) has been used by organizations to attempt to achieve efficiency and productivity at work. Suites A market has developed for enterprise software leveraging the business process management concepts to organize and automate processes. The recent convergence of this software from distinct pieces such as business rules engine, business process modelling, business activity monitoring and Human Workflow has given birth to integrated Business Process Management Suites. Forrester Research, Inc recognize the BPM suite space through three different lenses: * human-centric BPM * integration-centric BPM (Enterprise Service Bus) * document-centric BPM (Dynamic Case Management) However, standalone integration-centric and document-centric offerings have matured into separate, standalone markets. Rapid application development using no-code/low-code principles is becoming an ever prevalent feature of BPMS platforms. RAD enables businesses to deploy applications more quickly and more cost effectively, while also offering improved change and version management. Gartner notes that as businesses embrace these systems, their budgets rely less on the maintenance of existing systems and show more investment in growing and transforming them. Practice Example of Business Process Management (BPM) Service Pattern: This pattern shows how business process management (BPM) tools can be used to implement business processes through the orchestration of activities between people and systems.NIH (2007). Business Process Management (BPM) Service Pattern . Accessed 29 November 2008. While the steps can be viewed as a cycle, economic or time constraints are likely to limit the process to only a few iterations. This is often the case when an organization uses the approach for short to medium term objectives rather than trying to transform the organizational culture. True iterations are only possible through the collaborative efforts of process participants. In a majority of organizations, complexity requires enabling technology (see below) to support the process participants in these daily process management challenges. To date, many organizations often start a BPM project or program with the objective of optimizing an area that has been identified as an area for improvement. Currently, the international standards for the task have limited BPM to the application in the IT sector, and ISO/IEC 15944 covers the operational aspects of the business. However, some corporations with the culture of best practices do use standard operating procedures to regulate their operational process.NTAID (2008). Invoice Processing Procedures for Contracts Accessed 17 September 2008. Other standards are currently being worked upon to assist in BPM implementation (BPMN, enterprise architecture, Business Motivation Model). =Technology= BPM is now considered a critical component of operational intelligence (OI) solutions to deliver real-time, actionable information. This real-time information can be acted upon in a variety of ways ‚Äì alerts can be sent or executive decisions can be made using real-time dashboards. OI solutions use real-time information to take automated action based on pre- defined rules so that security measures and or exception management processes can be initiated. Because \\"the size and complexity of daily tasks often requires the use of technology to model efficiently\\" when resources in technology became increasingly widespread with general availability to businesses to provide to their staff, \\"Many thought BPM as the bridge between Information Technology (IT) and Business.\\" There are four critical components of a BPM Suite: * Process engine ‚Äì a robust platform for modeling and executing process-based applications, including business rules * Business analytics ‚Äì enable managers to identify business issues, trends, and opportunities with reports and dashboards and react accordingly * Content management ‚Äì provides a system for storing and securing electronic documents, images, and other files * Collaboration tools ‚Äì remove intra- and interdepartmental communication barriers through discussion forums, dynamic workspaces, and message boards BPM also addresses many of the critical IT issues underpinning these business drivers, including: * Managing end-to-end, customer-facing processes * Consolidating data and increasing visibility into and access to associated data and information * Increasing the flexibility and functionality of current infrastructure and data * Integrating with existing systems and leveraging service oriented architecture (SOA) * Establishing a common language for business-IT alignment Validation of BPMS is another technical issue that vendors and users must be aware of, if regulatory compliance is mandatory. The validation task could be performed either by an authenticated third party or by the users themselves. Either way, validation documentation must be generated. The validation document usually can either be published officially or retained by users. =Cloud computing BPM= Cloud computing business process management is the use of (BPM) tools that are delivered as software services (SaaS) over a network. Cloud BPM business logic is deployed on an application server and the business data resides in cloud storage. Market According to Gartner, 20% of all the \\"shadow business processes\\" are supported by BPM cloud platforms. Gartner refers to all the hidden organizational processes that are supported by IT departments as part of legacy business processes such as Excel spreadsheets, routing of emails using rules, phone calls routing, etc. These can, of course also be replaced by other technologies such as workflow and smart form software. Benefits The benefits of using cloud BPM services include removing the need and cost of maintaining specialized technical skill sets in-house and reducing distractions from an enterprise's main focus. It offers controlled IT budgeting and enables geographical mobility.. =Internet of things= The emerging Internet of things poses a significant challenge to control and manage the flow of information through large numbers of devices. To cope with this, a new direction known as BPM Everywhere shows promise as a way of blending traditional process techniques, with additional capabilities to automate the handling of all the independent devices.

Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, and is now a state with more than 40 million inhabitants, most of whom are Christian Orthodox; and 70% of the population is urban.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html One of the biggest feminist organization in Europe was founded during the 1920s in modern western Ukraine or Galicia. The organization was called the Ukrainian Women's Union, and was led by Milena Rudnytska. During the Soviet- era feminism was classified as a bourgeois ideology, hence counterrevolutionary and anti-Soviet. Civil society and feminism were virtually nonexistent in the Soviet times. After independence of Ukraine in 1991, a feminist movement began taking root.A Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms: Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe, 19th and 20th Centuries by Francisca De Haan, Krasimira Daskalova and Anna Loutfi, Central European University Press, 2006, (page 411 etc.) Currently there are several women's rights groups active in Ukraine,Women accuse Ukraine's Azarov of discrimination, Kyiv Post (April 1, 2010)New Feminist Offensive aims to lift women, Kyiv Post (22 March 2012)Feminine Femen targets 'sexpats', Kyiv Post (May 22, 2009) including Feminist Ofenzyva –ê–±–æ—Ä—Ç–∏ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ: –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –≤–∏–±—ñ—Ä —á–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –∂–∏—Ç—Ç—è?

Street women are the most vulnerable category; around 40 percent of them suffer from sexual violence, with 25 percent being under 18. In 2001, Ukraine enacted the Domestic Violence (Prevention) Act 2001.http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Law%202789%20of%202001%20on%20Violence%20in%20the%20Family.pdf Article 173-2 of the Code of Administrative Offences of Ukraine also deals with \\"violence over family\\". Nuzhat Ehsan, UN Population Fund representative in Ukraine, stated in February 2013 ‚ÄúUkraine really has an unacceptable level of violence, mainly by men and mainly due to high level of alcohol consumption‚Äù. He also blamed loopholes in the legislation contribute to the problem of domestic violence, ‚ÄúYou can violate women and still if you are a high-level official or from a high-level official family, you can get away with it‚Äù. Women in the labor force Women make up 54% of the population of Ukraine and 47.4% of its labor force.https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS Over 60% of all Ukrainian women have higher education (college level and above). However, the unemployment rate of women is very high compared to men with the same educational background (80% of all unemployed in Ukraine are women), not to mention the extensive hidden unemployment among women.http://www.belgium.iom.int/StopConference/relevantdocs/030%20Pyschulina.%20Human%20Trafficking%20in%20Ukraine%20and%20prevention.pdf Labor laws establish the legal equality of men and women, including equal pay for equal work, a principle that generally was observed. However, industries dominated by female workers had the lowest relative wages and were the ones most likely to be affected by wage arrears. The retirement age is in the process of being gradually increased, to 60 years for women and 62 years for men-civil servants by 2021 (the original age was 55 for women and 60 for men). There were reports of some employers refusing to hire younger women likely to become pregnant or women over 35. Women also received lower salaries and had limited opportunity for career advancement. Few women held top managerial positions in the government or in state- owned or private industry. Women in Ukrainian business On average women earn 30% less than men occupying similar posts.On Women‚Äôs Day, struggle for equality remains, Kyiv Post (8 March 2012) About 50% of all enterprises without employees are woman owned. Enterprises with 1 to 5 employees are 27% woman owned. Enterprises with less than 50 employees are 30% woman owned. These numbers are similar to those in other Western economies. Women tend to lead small business in retail, wholesale trade and catering.New Perspectives on Women Entrepreneurs by John Butler, Information Age Publishing, 2000, (page 251) 2% of large companies are headed by women.Topless protesters gain fame in Ukraine, The Washington Post (November 19, 2010) In 2008, women‚Äôs Labour Participation Rate (LPR) was approximately 62%. Women in Ukrainian politics In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election 87 women were elected to parliament, a record for Ukraine, 20.52% of the total number of deputies. The new Council has increased the number of women deputies, Ukrayinska Pravda (23 July 2019) In the election about 50% of elected Voice deputies were women, 37% of the elected European Solidarity MP's were women; the least places for women was in Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life with 11.4%. In 2014, about 12.1% the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) were women. From the 2014 parliamentary election to the 2019 election this number increased to 53, that is, 12.6%. The percentage of female lawmakers fluctuates per election.Women's Social Activism in the New Ukraine by Sarah D. Phillips, Indiana University Press, 2008, (page 57/58) Of the 47 women elected in 2014 to parliament only 2 achieved this by winning a constituency (the election used a mixed electoral system with 53.2% MP's elected under party lists and 46.8% in 198 constituenciesParliamentary elections not to be held at nine constituencies in Donetsk region and six constituencies in Luhansk region - CEC, Interfax-Ukraine (25 October 2014)). In 2019 26 women won a constituency seat. In the parliament elected in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election women made up 9.9% of the parliament.Too few women in the Ukrainian parliament, Kyiv Post (14 December 2012) In the first parliamentary election held after 1991's Ukrainian independence held in 1994 only 11 women (2.3% of the parliament) were elected.

It is located in the deanery of Rhos, the archdeaconry of St Asaph, and the Diocese of St Asaph. The church is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building. History The first religious building on the site was a mission room in 1872 which was replaced by an iron and timber church in 1880. This building was burnt down in 1886. The present church was designed by the Chester firm of Douglas and Fordham and built in stages. The nave was built in 1887‚Äì88 and the chancel was added between 1894 and 1895. The tower was started in 1910 and completed the following year. It was the last major project to be undertaken by John Douglas but he died before it was completed. In 1920 a narthex with a west door, designed by W. D. Caroe, was added as a war memorial. Architecture and contents The church is large and cruciform, built in coursed rubble limestone with Runcorn red sandstone dressings and bands. The nave of five bays is broad with low arcades and a tall clerestory. The windows are lancets, with a rose window in the south transept. The tower is \\"bold, craggy and heavily buttressed\\". Internally there is a sedilia in the chancel, designed by Douglas. The stalls are carved with detail which is in \\"typical Douglas\\" style. The reredos and riddle posts, dating from 1934‚Äì35, were designed by Caroe and are elaborately carved. Depicted on the reredos are representations of the Supper at Emmaus and the Annunciation together with figures of Saint Kentigern, Saint Asaph, St Aidan and the Venerable Bede. In the west window and in the two narthex windows is stained glass designed by Horace Wilkinson in 1920‚Äì21. The first stage of the organ was built by Peter Connacher and Son in 1888. It was completed when the nave was built in 1891 and rebuilt by John Cowin in 1960. Hubbard describes the church as \\"an extraordinary building\\" and suggests that it might be Douglas' \\"prodigy church of its decade\\".

Ranked in 2013 as one of the \\"Top 100 Brewers in the World\\" by RateBeer.com, Shmaltz won 9 Gold and 5 Silver Medals in the World Beer Championships in 2012. A recipient of the \\"Distinguished Business Award\\" by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, Shmaltz was also included in the \\"Top 50 Fastest Growing Bay Area Companies\\" by San Francisco Business Times. Founder and owner Jeremy Cowan established the company in San Francisco in 1996. He'brew now sells across 37 states, through 40 wholesalers and nearly 5,000 retailers. In 2007, Shmaltz released a new line of craft brewed lagers under the Coney Island banner. The company's name refers to shmaltz, a type of cooking fat that is frequently associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine; all He'Brew Beers are certified kosher. He'Brew Beer He'brew Death of a Contract Brewer Black IPA He'Brew Beer began as a Chanukah experiment in 1996 when founder and proprietor Jeremy Cowan and friends squeezed pomegranates to produce juice for the first HE'BREW beer. Early distribution for this beer was done by Cowan himself out of the trunk of his grandmother's car in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1997, Anderson Valley Brewing Company began brewing He'Brew and its distribution expanded to small craft beer wholesalers in California, Chicago and New York. In 2003, Shmaltz began packaging selling Genesis Ale and Messiah Nut Brown Ale in six-packs and moved production to Mendocino Brewing Company's facility in Saratoga Springs, NY. =Marketing= He'Brew Beers generally have names alluding to Jewish history and culture. Each label of He'Brew Beer lists facts and quotations related to the beer's inspiration and its ingredients. He'Brew's marketing incorporates Jewish religious references into the beers' names and slogans. Genesis Ale was the first He'Brew creation, and the company described its \\"Messiah Nut Brown Ale\\" as \\"the beer you've been waiting for\\", a reference to Jewish beliefs regarding the Messiah. The Hop Manna IPA refers to manna, a Biblical food eaten by the Israelites during the exodus from Egypt. =Series= In 2006 He'Brew debuted Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A., a rye double IPA dedicated to the late Jewish comedian Lenny Bruce. The barrel-aged version of Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A., R.I.P.A. on Rye, took home the Silver Medal in the Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beer category at the 2010 Great American Beer Festival. Shmaltz offers the \\"Rejewvenator\\" and \\"Jewbelation\\" series as limited seasonal releases; the Beverage Testing Institute awarded both Rejewvenator 2009 and Rejewvenator 2010 a gold medal at their 2010 and 2011 World Beer Championships, respectively. Craft Beer Bar Mitzvah In September 2010 owner Jeremy Cowan published a small business memoir, Craft Beer Bar Mitzvah, that chronicles Cowan's upbringing in the Northern California suburbs and describes how HE'BREW Beer evolved from an inside joke with high school friends to a nationally distributed craft beer brand under Shmaltz Brewing Company. The book was launched at Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, and a second edition was released in December 2010. \\"Craft Beer Bar Mitzvah\\" was written with help from friend and journalist James Sullivan and is published by Malt Shop Publishing. Coney Island Craft Lagers Summer 2008 marked the official launch of Shmaltz's Coney Island Craft Lagers line. This brand was released in partnership with the arts organization Coney Island USA, a 501(c)3 Non-Profit, and a portion of the proceeds from Coney Island Craft Lagers directly benefited Coney Island USA. The line includes the flagship Coney Island Lager, which was first released in June 2007, and five experimental lagers: Sword Swallower, Albino Python, Mermaid Pilsner, Human Blockhead (Winter), and Freaktoberfest (Fall). In 2010 the brand was awarded \\"Best Craft Brewer\\" and \\"Best in Show\\" at industry publication Beverage World Magazine's BevStar Awards for product quality, brand marketing, and overall creativity in \\"pushing the limits of lager.\\" Coney Island Brewing Company In May 2010 Shmaltz launched its first brewing location in Brooklyn, New York. At per batch, Coney Island Brewing Company was officially the smallest commercial brewery by volume in the world. In August 2011, Coney Island Brewing Company registered as a fully licensed brewery with the state of New York, and within its brewery, staff began bottling its nano-batches of beer for sale to the public, including a Pumpernickel Bagel Porter and a Cotton Candy Wit Ale. =Marketing= The artwork for Coney Island Lagers was the creation of Shmaltz's art director Matt Polacheck and Brooklyn-based tattoo artist Dave C. Wallin, whose original illustrations spotlight Heather Holliday (Sword Swallower) and the MC of the sideshow, Donny Vomit (Human Blockhead). The logo for the brand and for Coney Island Lager is based on the iconic \\"Tillie\\" face that graced the entrance of George Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island. =Boston Beer Co.

His preferred position is in the Second Row although he can also play equally well in the back-row. He currently plays for Benetton Treviso in the Pro14 competition and the European Heineken Cup. Club career He began his career playing since youth level for Rugby Rovigo, making his first appearance in the Italian first division in 2002, aged 19. After five seasons at Rovigo, in 2005 he then transferred to Benetton Treviso, the main club of nearby city Treviso. Starting from the 2009‚Äì10 season, he was also made club captain in place of Benjamin De Jager; Pavanello has consequently held the honour of being both the last captain of Treviso competing in the Italian first division (2009‚Äì10) and leading his team into their first ever match for the Celtic League tournament (2010‚Äì11), a home game in which they defeated the Scarlets. National team While playing for youth and senior teams of Rugby Rovigo, he made a good enough impression to be selected for Italy at Under 19, Under 21 and 'A' levels. During his time in Treviso he has been capped five times by the Italy national rugby union team until 2007, playing 11 minutes against Argentina and 29 minutes against Australia in 2005. He gained his third cap against Argentina in 2007 playing 6 minutes as a replacement. Pavanello was then basically dropped from the Italian main team for the whole tenure of Nick Mallett as head-coach (2007‚Äì11): though formally in the list of players eligible for taking the pitch in the 2010 Six Nations Championship, he only played in three test matches. Despite good efforts with the Italian 'A' team at the 2011 Churchill Cup, he was not selected for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand; his drop caused some criticism since the Italian team had poorly performed at line-out at the 2011 Six Nations Championship, whereas Treviso second-row led by Pavanello had proved consistent in this specific fundamental during the same season, but only fellow second-row teammate Corniel van Zyl was selected for the World Cup. In the wake of the 2012 Six Nations Championship, under newly installed head-coach Jacques Brunel, Pavanello regained his place in the national team. In the tournament, he had to skip the first game against France due to ban, before taking the pitch against England and Ireland; in the latter game, he suffered an injury which prevented him from finishing the tournament. Personal life Pavanello gained a master's degree in Architecture from Iuav University of Venice in October 2008. He is married with a daughter born in 2011.

It is the last traditional microscope manufacturer of makers such as Vickers, W.Watson and Son, Baker, Charles Perry, Cooke, Troughton & Simms and many others who have ceased to produce microscopes.  History  Early History = W.R.Prior & Co.Ltd. was founded by Walter Robert Prior in 1919. The Blitz in 1941 destroyed the factory building so the company moved their new facility in Bishop Stortford in 1942. Many records and a collection of microscopes from the early days of the company were also lost in a fire in 1988 but some illustrated catalogues have survived which give an indication of the range of quality instruments produced by W.R.Prior over the years for the highly competitive market of the time. W.R.Prior & Co.Ltd offices were originally located at 9,10,11 Eagle Street, Holborn, London and later at 28a Devonshire Street, London W.1. Little is known about the Company during this time and no records or catalogues exist as to when and why they began to produce microscopes under the Prior name. A W.R.Prior catalogue of microscopes and accessories dated February 1950 gives the location of the office as Devonshire Street and the factory as Bishop's Stortford, Herts. England.(13 Northgate End) where manufacturing was carried out from 1942-1957. = War Time = The Eagle Street factory was destroyed during the London Blitz and the Company relocated to 13 Northgate End, Bishop Stortford. Herts. The building occupied was a garage and work commenced producing optical gun sights, tank periscopes, and range finders for the Ministry of Defence. No microscopes were produced during the war. The first post war abridged catalogue includes a wood block illustration of a student ‚ÄúC‚Äù limb microscope with the limb engraved with the Eagle Street address. = Post War = On 10 January 1947 Walter Robert Prior died at the early age of 55. 1953 brought the start of manufacturing micromanipulators for Prior and later the micropositioner was developed. Both of these are still made to this day. The Company relocated to a new factory at London Road, Bishop Stortford in 1956 and continued to produce and develop new microscopes. Because of the need for new universities and colleges during the post war period there was a demand for microscopes and accessories and Prior was innovative in developing instruments for this market while maintaining the pre-war quality and finish. The Science Master Microscope, introduced in 1957, was in great demand for use in schools. The established Prior Monocular Dissecting Microscope was widely supplied for educational use. The robustness and simplicity of these instruments gave many years of trouble free use. For the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London 1962, Prior supplied a Modular Inverted Microscope housed in a temperature controlled cabine for cell culture examination. The provision of a cine camera enabled continuous or time lapse cine-photography to be carried out. The Cinemicroscope was also adaptable for still photography or closed circuit television. This microscope was certainly advanced of its time and one of the fore-runners of the modern inverted microscope-now such an essential tool in cell biology and tissue culture work. A unique Prior Tissue Culture Chamber was also supplied and enabled work to be carried out when using an inverted or standard erect microscope. = 1970 - Present Day = In 1978 W.R.Prior & Co.Ltd. was acquired by The Gwyndann Group of Companies and the name of the company was changed in 1979 to that of Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd. In 1981 Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd. merged with James Swift and Son Ltd. James Swift & Son was founded in 1854 and had an international reputation for producing advanced student and research polarising microscopes. The unique Swift Point Counter complimented the polarising microscope range and was sold worldwide. The James Swift factory was initially at Basingstoke, Hants. this was closed after a year and the company joined Prior Scientific Instruments at London Road, Bishop's Stortford. In 1981 Prior launched a new modular series of stereomicroscopes- the S2000 series. The intention was that this instrument would replace and upgrade the Stereomaster microscope. The design had been based on that of an operating microscope featuring a long working distance it also had a tumbler rotating magnification system and a common objective. The design was a complete deviation from that of the previous Prior Greenough type microscope. Fire at the Bishop Stortford factory in 1988 meant the company had to relocate to its present site in Fulbourn, Cambridge, England, offering precision mechanical engineering, optics, electronics and precision assembly. Expanding its operation further the company opened a new office in 1991, Prior Scientific Inc, based in Rockland near Boston USA, in 2008 Prior GMBH in Jena, Germany, in 2010 Prior KK in Tokyo, Japan and in 2018 Prior China in Suzhou China.

The proceeds from the sale of his paintings were held in the Henry Tayali Painting Fund, administered by Trustees who included Eric Gargett and E. H. Ashton. The money in the Fund would be released when Henry was accepted at University (see also). In early 1967, before his Cambridge 'O' Level Certificate results came out, Tayali left Rhodesia (the Southern was dropped when Zambia gained independence in 1964) for Zambia, and applied for a bursary from the Zambian Government - expressing an interest in Architecture with Art. With help from his father (who went to school at Lubwa Mission in Chinsali in Northern Rhodesia with the likes of Kenneth Kaunda (President of Zambia 1964‚Äì1991), Simon Kapwepwe (Vice President 1967‚Äì1970), and Wesley Nyirenda and others, and who lobbied the Ministry of Education at Ridgeway in Lusaka on his behalf), he was awarded a Zambian Government scholarship to study at Uganda's Makerere University in Kampala, where he graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Shortly after Idi Amin seized power in Uganda, Tayali returned to Zambia and then started work at the University of Zambia where he joined the Institute of African Studies in Lusaka as a lecturer in African art and later as University Artist. In 1972, Tayali got a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) scholarship to study for a Masters in Fine Arts at the Staatliche Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, West Germany. Tayali was the first recipient of the DAAD to be selected from south of the equator. His professor, Gerd Weber, said of him, \\"Of all the foreign students who have worked in my class, Henry Tayali is by far the most talented of them all. His work constitutes a synthesis between the traditional African art, the tools and techniques of the modern era.\\" (see also). After graduating in 1975, and fluent in German (in addition to English, Bemba, Ndebele, and Ngoni), he returned to Lusaka to the Institute of African Studies. In early 1978, Tayali returned to West Germany to embark on a Doctor of Fine Arts degree at the Akademie f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste, but the arrangements did not work out and he returned to Zambia bitterly disappointed. =Marriage and Family= In 1971, he married Regina Mary Birungi Kivubiro while still in Uganda, and just before returning to Zambia and they had a son in 1972, Rhodrick Tayali. Regina died in 1976. Tayali had a daughter in 1980, Katwishi Alanda Tayali, followed in 1983 by a son, Chaswe Angio Tayali, with Rosemary Kaluwa, whom he later married. Tayali's son Rhodrick is an object and interior designer - Diploma-Designer (FH) - by training and a graduate of the Fachhochschule Aachen, and is also an accomplished artist in his own right. Tayali died on 22 July 1987 while visiting his eldest son and family friends the Moiks / Moik-Becker in Aachen, West Germany, after attending his youngest brother's wedding in Southampton, England. He was buried at Leopards Hill Cemetery in Lusaka. =Career= Henry Tayali showing some of his artwork to then Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, 1972 When the family was in Bulawayo, Tayali's natural talent was spotted early on by Alex Lambeth, who ran the African Affairs Department of Bulawayo City Council. Lambeth encouraged Tayali to pursue art as a career, and enrolled him on an artwork course. This led to Henry's first exhibition in Bulawayo at the age of fifteen. His painting career took off after that, and using water colours, Tayali begun to produce varied, vibrant, dynamic works such as Sunset Road and Destiny. He also produced sculptures - amongst them The Graduate at the University of Zambia campus in Lusaka, as well as silk-screens and woodcuts, a few of these were printed as greeting cards and sold through newsagents and book stores. Tayali held exhibitions in Lusaka, Bulawayo, Aachen, D√ºsseldorf, London (Commonwealth Institute, 1983), Alberta, and Toronto as well as in Zambia, where a few of his exhibitions were opened by Kenneth Kaunda, the first President of Zambia. He was associated with artists, authors and politicians, including Simon and Cynthia Zukas, Andrew Sardanis (whose property at Chaminuka houses a collection of Tayali's paintings and sculptures amongst others) and American Professor Melvin Edwards at home and abroad, many of them becoming lifelong friends. There were also joint exhibitions and support, such as that provided by the Alliance Francaise. His works still continue to be exhibited in Zambia and across the world, and his influence carries on at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe. Numerous examples of Tayali's works are held in private collections across the globe. Tayali was also a keen photographer, having studied photography for his Masters, and always carried his trusted Leica SLR camera with him wherever he went. On his projects for the University, he produced a huge catalogue of photographs (often developing the prints himself, and having photographic slides made) of artefacts and people - something he worked hard for as a record for posterity. Some of the photographs he took on his field trips around Zambia were turned into postcards. Other work included efforts to establish a School of Fine Arts in Zambia and numerous field trips within Zambia to record and preserve the arts and cultures of the various tribes for posterity - including audio recordings. He was involved in organising the attendance - and was part - of the Zambian delegation at the Second African Festival of Arts and Culture in Lagos, Nigeria, 1977 (FESTAC'77). In addition to lecturing at the University of Zambia, Tayali also lectured at the Evelyn Hone College near the city centre in Lusaka. He was also a restaurant/hotel critic - having travelled extensively all over the world as well as widely within Zambia in that role. Works Henry Tayali - Village Scene at Night (early 1960s water colour painting) Henry Tayali and his brother Bright Tayali and early metalwork sculptures, Roma, Lusaka, 1976 As a young man, Tayali had started his painting using water colours, producing works of great detail, vividness and vibrancy - his depiction of human figures similar in style to the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo (e.g. his watercolours held at the US National Archive: see External Links below) - before progressing to oil paintings. His paintings evolved from the fine art style of the late 1950s/1960s/early 1970s, to semi-abstract, through to abstract, and then edging to minimalism at the time of his death. His paintings were distinctive, blending African and Western styles, reflecting the influences on his life. Tayali's paintings ranged in size from small scale to large wall murals ‚Äì as in the German Embassy in Lusaka ‚Äì and very large canvases of more than two metres in length by at least a metre and a half. Often, he would be working simultaneously on four or more paintings at a go, and different prints and sculptures at the same time ‚Äì all the while with the backdrop of lecturing at the University, or undertaking research in different and remote parts of Zambia (mostly by road), or travelling internationally. His woodcuts and silk- screens remained largely the same in composition throughout the latter half of his life, and he used them to pass frank comment on the lives of his subjects ‚Äì the ordinary, common, people of Zambia (and Zimbabwe earlier), particularly the beer gardens with their many characters, their many facets, their rich tapestry of social gatherings and social interactions (see Bier Garten below). Some critics have called some of his works 'crowded social realism'. Equally, he would not leave out depicting his observations of the lone beggar in the street, or the market trader women, or politicians in Africa. He was not averse to using his art to pass comment on any of them. From a young age, Tayali had always been interested in sculptures and modelling - and he went on to produce sculptures such as The Graduate seen here on the banner of the University of Zambia web-page, at the UNZA Great East Road campus. Funded by donations from the Zambia State Lottery, the Anglo-American Corporation and some individuals, it depicts a graduating student in his flowing gown and mortar board hat, the book in his left hand signifying progress through learning in the modern world, and the hoe in the right hand the hard work and progress through agriculture that has underpinned the country in general. He also produced a huge sculpture of a bird (work in concrete) at the Kapiri Mposhi railway station - the terminus end of the mid-seventies Chinese built Tazara (TAnzania ZAmbia RAilway) railway, whose other end is in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania's capital on the Indian Ocean coast. From about 1976, he started working with welded metal sculptures. Initially these were fairly simple as he was new to the medium and its techniques, but by the time of his death they had a majestic complexity to them - probably the most famous example is The Bull, which was mounted on the road to Lusaka International Airport. His painting Destiny, produced while Tayali was still in school, has been described as \\"an attempt to express the profound thoughts of a serious young man, about the struggles of Mankind now and in the future\\" and has been exhibited around the world., see also In 1991, it was purchased by the Lechwe Trust, a charity which supports visual artists in Zambia. Tayali had a close association with the Mpapa Gallery, where his works had often been exhibited. Speaking of his work in 1979, Tayali said, \\"My art is concerned with the suffering of the people and I want it to be the echo of that suffering. I see the problems of the continent... I am just recording what I and my people feel, but I do not attempt to provide answers to our problems \\". Writing in 1980, the American academic Bob Barde placed Tayali's woodcut prints on a par with Europe's great printmakers such as K√§the Kollwitz and Th√©odore G√©ricault. Tayali's woodcut subjects were usually about the common African man (and woman), and the feelings evoked by his daily travails, and the prevailing political landscape of the times. Barde described his prints as \\"powerful\\" and said that he \\"seems destined to play an important role in modern African art.\\" On a personal side, with his trademark paint-splattered jeans and majestic walk, he also had a terrific sense of humour to counterbalance his serious approach to work, and this sometimes broke out in - apart from the comments - exaggerated physical attributes on some of his subjects in a few of his works. The art writer, Jean Kennedy said that Tayali's work, \\"makes strong statements, frequently leavened with humor, about personal and communal tragedies\\". Legacy Henry Tayali, with Lungu, Lusaka, 1976 Tayali was one of the first Africans to work tirelessly to raise the profile of indigenous African art and crafts in Zambia, Africa, and the world through workshops, conferences, discussions, exhibitions, newspaper articles, magazines and television appearances. He played a very pivotal and influential role in cultural and artistic development in Zambia. and Africa. He was president of the International Association of Artists in Zambia (which fell under UNESCO), and represented Zambia at various international symposia and conferences. He also headed the Art Centre Foundation, the National Craft Council of Zambia, and the National Museums Board. In reflection of his work and legacy, it has been suggested that his work Destiny is a historical piece of art, and not just an eye-catcher. In 1989, over seventy artists from around Zambia convened at Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Sciences, and formed the Zambia National Visual Arts Council (VAC) in his honour - as the national organisation for visual artists to be run by artists in Zambia. They named its headquarters at the Lusaka Showgrounds \\"The Henry Tayali Visual Art Centre\\". The Visual Arts Council started its operations in 1991, but the Visual Arts Centre was officially opened later in 1995. It hosts art competitions, exhibitions, and seminars and it is one of the must-sees on the Zambian tourist circuit. The Ngoma Awards, sponsored by the National Arts Council of Zambia confers the \\"Henry Tayali Award\\" for Best Two-Dimensional Visual Artist.

Such systems are offered as optional equipment on certain premium vehicles. The technology was first introduced in the year 2000 on the Cadillac Deville.http://ask.cars.com/2008/09/what-are-led-ta.html title=What are LED taillights? This technology is based on the night vision devices (NVD), which generally denotes any electronically enhanced optical devices operate in three modes: image enhancement, thermal imaging, and active illumination. The automotive night vision system is a combination of NVDs such as infrared cameras, GPS, Lidar, and Radar, among others to sense and detect objects. Display type *Instrument cluster using a high resolution liquid-crystal display (LCD), newest type *navigation system or information screen, least expensive and with display's location further away from driver's field of vision (used exclusively by BMW, and the W212 E-class) *windshield via head-up display, earliest type, dimmer knob can reduce brightness, display nearest to driver's line of sight There are two types of systems, either passive or active systems, both have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. The passive system pertains to the technologies that detect thermal radiation emitted by humans, animals, and other objects in the road while the active systems illuminate objects as a significant distance ahead using infrared light sources. Active systems Active systems use an infrared light source built into the car to illuminate the road ahead with light that is invisible to humans. There are two kinds of active systems: gated and non- gated. The gated system uses a pulsed light source and a synchronized camera that enable long ranges (250m) and high performance in rain and snow. Near Infrared wavelength is 0.75‚Äì1.4 ¬µm is smaller and can pass between the typical fog particles. Fog particles sizes are typically 10 to 15 microns and ranges is sizes from 1 to 100 microns.Atmospheric Optics  Clouds, fog & water droplets Far infrared has a wavelength of 15 micrometers (¬µm) to 1 mm.

This system uses the headlight projectors emitting near infrared light aimed like the car's highbeam headlights and a CCD camera then captures that reflected radiation, this signal is then processed by computer which produces a black-and-white image which is projected on the lower section of the windshield. In February 2008 the Toyota Crown Hybrid added a feature which highlights pedestrians and presents them in a box on an LCD display in front of the driver. This was the first pedestrian detection feature for an active system. In 2009 Lexus Night View in Japan, on LS. In 2012 Lexus introduced Night View worldwide, on LShttp://www.toyota.com/esq/pdf/The%202013%20LS%20Advanced%20Active%20Safety%20%282%290.pdf 2013 Lexus LS Advanced Active Safety Features and GS. The Night View system combines a windshield mounted near infra-red camera and near infra-red projectors within the headlamps with a Night View ECU to display an image of the road ahead on center console display screen. Moving the image from the driver‚Äôs instrument display to the center console offers drivers a larger display and an easier viewing angle. With the camera constantly in operation and the near infra-red projectors activating at speeds over 10 MPH to enhance system efficiency, night view will display an area up to 65 feet in front of the vehicle.http://blog.lexus.co.uk/2012/10/new-lexus-ls-world-first- technology-as-standard/ NEW LEXUS LS: WORLD-FIRST TECHNOLOGY AS STANDARD Discontinued for 2014 in US.http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2013/09/lexus- drops-night-vision-tech.html Lexus Drops Night Vision Tech Passive systems Passive infrared systems do not use an infrared light source, instead they capture thermal radiation already emitted by the objects, using a thermographic camera. *Pros: greater range of about 300 meters or 1,000 feet, higher contrast for living objects *Cons: grainy, lower resolution image, works poorly in warmer weather conditions, larger sensor =Audi= Audi A8 grill, right circle Night Vision Assistant was introduced in 2010 on the Audi A8. It uses a thermal imaging camera behind the four rings at the front of the car which can \\"see\\" 300 meters (984 ft) ahead. The display in the instrument cluster highlights humans with yellow markings. More importantly, the computer can determine if the person on the road moves in a way that could lead to a collision with the car. In that case the pedestrian is being marked in red color and the driver of the car receives an audible warning. 2013 update added animal detection.https://www.audi- mediaservices.com/publish/ms/content/en/public/pressemitteilungen/2013/08/21/audi_a8.html Composure redefined ‚Äì the Audi A8 and Pedestrian Marker Lights: As soon as a pedestrian is detected by the Night Vision Assistant in a critical range in front of the vehicle, individual Matrix LEDs flash briefly 3 times in succession to alert that person, who is then clearly visible to the driver.http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/vorsprung_durch_technik/content/2013/10/audi-a8-in- a-new-radiant-light.html Audi Matrix LED =BMW= BMW Night Vision introduced in 2005 on the BMW 7 Series (E65). This system processes far infrared radiation, which minimizes non-essential information placing a greater emphasis on pedestrians and animals, allows for a range of 300 meters or nearly 1,000 feet, and avoids \\"dazzle\\" from headlights, road lights and similar intense light sources. 2008 update added pedestrian detection system on the redesigned BMW 7 Series (F01), which flashes a caution symbol on the navigation/information screen and automotive head-up display when it detects pedestrians. 2013 update added Dynamic Light Spot. 2013 update added animal detection. The system provides a real-time video image that also depicts on the Control Display persons, animals and other objects emitting heat when they are outside of the light beam and warns in the event of an impending collision. The Dynamic Light Spot is produced by a special headlight that directs the light beam onto the recognised persons or animals respectively, thus drawing the driver‚Äôs attention to possible hazards in good time. As soon as the remote infrared detects pedestrians or larger animals on course for collision in the dark, the system directs two separately controlled Dynamic Light Spots at them without creating an unpleasant glare. In the event of an acute risk, an acoustic warning signal is also sounded and the brakes are set to maximum standby. For the model year 2014, the BMW 5 Series will also have these new features. =Cadillac= First worldwide series production automotive night vision on 2000 Cadillac Deville: Night Vision, however it was discontinued in 2004. This system was developed with Raytheon and worked by using a passive infrared sensor camera mounted behind the vehicle's grille. Infrared radiation is picked up by the sensor, processed by computer and then displayed on the windshield using a head-up display. Information is displayed as a black-and-white image with warmer objects in white, while cooler objects appear black. Because this system outputs a standard NTSC composite video signal and the used parts are somewhat easy and inexpensive to find, it has become a popular choice for fitting thermal night vision to other vehicles. After a long hiatus, the 2016 flagship Cadillac CT6 was equipped with an improved version of the Enhanced Night Vision, in which the images are displayed and embedded in the instrument panel instead of being displayed as a reflection on the windshield. =Honda= In 2004, Honda introduced first worldwide system with pedestrian detection on redesigned Honda Legend: Intelligent Night Vision. It detected far infrared radiation. The pedestrian detection feature alerted the driver with an audio warning and visually enclosed the pedestrian in a box on the display which was presented via head- up display. The night vision system uses a separate heads up type display projected on the center bottom of the windshield. The infrared cameras do not require a light source, and the software is able to detect human like figures, surround the image with a red box and give audible caution tones. = DS Automobiles = DS Night Vision offers road visibility by night. An infrared camera in the front grill identifies objects, pedestrians and animals on the road at a distance of up to 100m. A digital instrument cluster shows the driver the area around the car in infrared, with a yellow line around any sources of potential danger. For critical danger, the line becomes red, allowing the driver to react to the situation. The DS 7 Crossback is the first DS vehicle to include Night Vision.

The problem of whether one can hear the shape of a drum is: given the Dirichlet eigenvalues, what features of the shape of the drum can one deduce. Here a \\"drum\\" is thought of as an elastic membrane Œ©, which is represented as a planar domain whose boundary is fixed. The Dirichlet eigenvalues are found by solving the following problem for an unknown function u ‚â† 0 and eigenvalue Œª Here Œî is the Laplacian, which is given in xy-coordinates by :\\\\Delta u = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2}. The boundary value problem () is the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation, and so Œª is known as a Dirichlet eigenvalue for Œ©. Dirichlet eigenvalues are contrasted with Neumann eigenvalues: eigenvalues for the corresponding Neumann problem. The Laplace operator Œî appearing in () is often known as the Dirichlet Laplacian when it is considered as accepting only functions u satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition. More generally, in spectral geometry one considers () on a manifold with boundary Œ©. Then Œî is taken to be the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator, also with Dirichlet boundary conditions. It can be shown, using the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators that the eigenspaces are finite-dimensional and that the Dirichlet eigenvalues Œª are real, positive, and have no limit point. Thus they can be arranged in increasing order: :0<\\\\lambda_1\\\\le\\\\lambda_2\\\\le\\\\cdots,\\\\quad \\\\lambda_n\\\\to\\\\infty, where each eigenvalue is counted according to its geometric multiplicity. The eigenspaces are orthogonal in the space of square-integrable functions, and consist of smooth functions. In fact, the Dirichlet Laplacian has a continuous extension to an operator from the Sobolev space H^2_0(\\\\Omega) into L^2(\\\\Omega). This operator is invertible, and its inverse is compact and self- adjoint so that the usual spectral theorem can be applied to obtain the eigenspaces of Œî and the reciprocals 1/Œª of its eigenvalues. One of the primary tools in the study of the Dirichlet eigenvalues is the max-min principle: the first eigenvalue Œª1 minimizes the Dirichlet energy. To wit, :\\\\lambda_1 = \\\\inf_{u ot=0}\\\\frac{\\\\int_\\\\Omega  abla u^2}{\\\\int_\\\\Omega u^2}, the infimum is taken over all u of compact support that do not vanish identically in Œ©. By a density argument, this infimum agrees with that taken over nonzero u\\\\in H_0^1(\\\\Omega). Moreover, using results from the calculus of variations analogous to the Lax‚ÄìMilgram theorem, one can show that a minimizer exists in H_0^1(\\\\Omega). More generally, one has :\\\\lambda_k = \\\\sup\\\\inf \\\\frac{\\\\int_\\\\Omega  abla u^2}{\\\\int_\\\\Omega u^2} where the supremum is taken over all (k‚àí1)-tuples \\\\phi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\phi_{k-1}\\\\in H^1_0(\\\\Omega) and the infimum over all u orthogonal to the \\\\phi_i. Applications 200pxthumbrightFig.1. Spiral-shaped boundary of the domain (blue), its chunk (red), and 3 segments of a ray (green). The Dirichlet Laplacian may arise from various problems of mathematical physics; it may refer to modes of at idealized drum, small waves at the surface of an idealized pool, as well as to a mode of an idealized optical fiber in the paraxial approximation. The last application is most practical in connection to the double-clad fibers; in such fibers, it is important, that most of modes of the fill the domain uniformly, or the most of rays cross the core. The poorest shape seems to be the circularly-symmetric domain ,. The modes of pump should not avoid the active core used in double- clad fiber amplifiers. The spiral-shaped domain happens to be especially efficient for such an application due to the boundary behavior of modes of Dirichlet laplacian. The theorem about boundary behavior of the Dirichlet Laplacian if analogy of the property of rays in geometrical optics (Fig.1); the angular momentum of a ray (green) increases at each reflection from the spiral part of the boundary (blue), until the ray hits the chunk (red); all rays (except those parallel to the optical axis) unavoidly visit the region in vicinity of the chunk to frop the excess of the angular momentum. Similarly, all the modes of the Dirichlet Laplacian have non-zero values in vicinity of the chunk. The normal component of the derivative of the mode at the boundary can be interpreted as pressure; the pressure integrated over the surface gives the force. As the mode is steady-state solution of the propagation equation (with trivial dependence of the longitudinal coordinate), the total force should be zero. Similarly, the angular momentum of the force of pressure should be also zero. However, there exists a formal proof, which does not refer to the analogy with the physical system.

Blanchard, 'Vaughan, Stephen (b. in or before 1502, d. 1549)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Life Vaughan was a merchant of London. About 1520 he made the acquaintance of Thomas Cromwell, and in March 1523-4 he was in Cromwell's service. Through Cromwell's influence he was employed by Cardinal Wolsey on the business of Cardinal College. He was still mainly occupied with commerce, and was a member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London. He frequently visited Antwerp, and was entrusted with commissions on behalf of Cromwell and of Henry VIII, and about 1530 became royal agent or king's factor in the Netherlands. His principal duty was to negotiate loans with the Fuggers, on commission.:s:Vaughan, Stephen (DNB00) John Hutton, governor of the Merchant Adventurers' Company, in 1529 instigated charges of heresy against Vaughan before William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Thomas More. The influence of Cromwell protected Vaughan, but More continued to seek evidence against him, and succeeded in turning George Constantine to use,Peter Ackroyd, The Life of Thomas More (1998), p. 297. and the matter was raised again in 1532. Meanwhile, in 1531 Henry VIII asked Vaughan to persuade William Tyndale to retract his heretical opinions and return to England. Vaughan had various ineffectual interviews with Tyndale, and forwarded early copies of his books to the king. His efforts did not satisfy Henry VIII, who thought Vaughan too sympathetic towards Tyndale, though Cromwell said otherwise.Robert Hutchinson, Thomas Cromwell (2007), p. 49. Vaughan also interceded in Hugh Latimer's favour when he was cited before convocation in January 1532, and reacted by writing a protest against Henry's persecution of reformers. He weathered this storm over his Protestant views. On Hutton's death about 1534 Vaughan succeeded him as governor of the Merchant Adventurers' Company. He also became, in succession to Sir John Hackett, president of the factory of English merchants at Antwerp, residing in what was called 'the English House. On 10 April 1534 he was appointed a clerk in chancery, an office which did not prevent his residence at Antwerp, and was on 6 August 1534 appointed to a salaried royal secretarial position. In December 1532 Vaughan was sent on a mission to Paris and Lyons, and in August following accompanied Christopher Mont on his tour through Germany to report on the political situation; after visiting Nuremberg, Cologne, and Saxony, he returned to Antwerp in December, where he sought to effect the capture of William Peto. In January 1536 he was in England, and was sent to watch over Eustace Chapuys during his interview with Catherine of Aragon, at Kimbolton, shortly before her death. That summer, when again at Antwerp, he made vain efforts to save Tyndale, who was executed. Soon afterwards he was given a position in the Royal mint, of which he ultimately became under-treasurer. In 1538 he was sent with Thomas Wriothesley and Sir Edward Carne to negotiate respecting the intended marriage of Henry VIII with the Duchess-consort of Milan. About the same time he became governor of the merchant adventurers of Bergen, and in 1541 he was sent with Carne to the regent of Flanders to procure the repeal of the restrictions on English commerce.'DCLXXXIX': Carne and Vaughan to King Henry VIII' and 'DCXC: Henry VIII to Carne and Vaughan', in State Papers Published under the Authority of Her Majesty's Commission, VIII: King Henry the Eighth, Part 5 - Continued (Commissioners, 1849), pp. 593-95 and pp. 595-97 (Google). In 1544 he was granted the clerkship of dispensations, and about the same time the priory of St. Mary Spital, Shoreditch. He retained his post as agent in the Netherlands until September 1546, when he returned to England and occupied himself with his business as under-treasurer of the mint. On 26 October 1547 he was returned to parliament for Lancaster. Vaughan died in London on 25 December 1549.

Biography Freudenberg was born in Osterwieck and grew up in the Saxony-Anhalt town of L√ºttgenrode, near what was then the border between West Germany and his native East Germany, a part of the communist Eastern Bloc, as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. After completing an apprenticeship as an electrician, he obtained his secondary education diploma in night school, then trained in information technology and received a diploma as an electronics engineer. In the autumn of 1988 he married his wife Sabine, a chemist he had met while both were students at Ilmenau University. With the erection of The Wall, East Germany cut them off from the professional opportunities that existed in the West, and the couple, especially Winfried, had become increasingly disappointed about being unable to cross the border. Immediately after the wedding the two began planning their escape to the West via a homemade balloon filled with natural gas (because its main component, methane, is lighter than air, natural gas can serve as a lifting gas). Escape attempt and death As part of their plan, Freudenberg took a job in a public utility that supplied natural gas, and the couple took an apartment in the East Berlin neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. In January and February 1989, they began assembling a 13 metre tall by 11 metre diameter balloon envelope out of polythene, which they cut into strips, taped together, and engirded with a string net. There was no basket, only a narrow wooden beam. On the evening of 7 March, they decided that the wind conditions were favourable for their escape. They drove to a pressure regulating station in the Blankenburg neighborhood to which Freudenberg had the keys and at midnight began to fill their balloon with gas. From some time after 1:00 a.m. the balloon was visible from a distance. A waiter on his way home from work, which had ended at 1:30 a.m., noticed the balloon and called the Volkspolizei. When the couple heard a patrol car arriving shortly after 2:00 a.m., the balloon was not yet completely filled. Because they feared it would not lift both of them, and Sabine was always doubtful, they quickly decided Freudenberg would escape alone. He occupied the beam and cut the tethers. With only one person aboard, the balloon had a very high buoyancy and rose fast. Ballast bags hanging down on ropes severed a power line shortly after launching, and caused it to short-cut and spark. Although East German security had often shot and killed citizens attempting to escape, they decided against shooting because of the possibility of triggering an explosion of the natural gas now leaking. Also, they believed Freudenberg had been killed by the current (which was not the case). 23-year-old Sabine was able to get back home, where the Stasi were already waiting for her. Zehlendorf The improvised balloon had too much buoyancy and, because it lacked a properly working valve, it rose quickly and much higher than planned. Freudenberg couldn't sink and spent more than five hours aloft. At first, his course was west-south-west. With wind velocities of about 20 km/h at the time he must have reached West Berlin after about 20 minutes. Later, Freudenberg passed over the Berlin Tegel Airport where he lost or dropped some ballast. His altitude must at this point have increased to more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), as his course now changed to south due to different direction of higher altitude winds. The balloon was sighted over Teufelsberg hill at dawn, where it was mistaken for a weather balloon. Shortly before flying into East German territory again, at 7:30, Freudenberg fell into the garden of a villa in the suburb of Zehlendorf. The remains of the balloon came down about one kilometer away on the median strip of a thoroughfare. Freudenberg's body was discovered hours later in the garden of a villa on Limastrasse. He evidently died instantly from injuries sustained in the crash. Nearly every bone in his body had been broken, and virtually every internal organ had been damaged.The Victims at the Berlin Wall 1961-1989: A Biographical Handbook The direct cause of the crash is unclear. West Berlin police supposed that Freudenberg climbed the net to cut the envelope, obviously succeeded, and in the ensuing events lost his hold. After the incident, East German police investigated Freudenberg's friends, family, acquaintances, colleagues, and wife, to determine whether any had participated in the escape attempt. Because of international attention and pressure over the recent shooting of Chris Gueffroy, the last refugee to be shot by East German border guards, Sabine was given the relatively lenient sentence of three years of probation and then granted amnesty in October 1989. The next month, East Germany began allowing its citizens to travel to the west, and several months later, the Berlin Wall was dismantled and the two countries reunified.

It deals with adoptions, divorce, children's issues, division of matrimonial property, personal protection orders, probate and maintenance. The family court in Singapore oversees these legal issues. Singapore has two separate and different sets of family law: one for Muslims and the other for everyone else. Family law for Muslims is codified in the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). Family law for non-Muslims is codified in the Women's Charter. The Family Justice Courts of Singapore (FJC) handles all family cases. Divorce Before a divorce can be granted or considered, the grounds for divorce must be establish. The recognised grounds are adultery, desertion and unreasonable behaviour. In addition, one party to the marriage has to be domiciled in Singapore or has been staying there for 3 years before one can file for a divorce in Singapore. This applies to both Singapore citizens or foreigners. To apply for a divorce, one has to file a writ for divorce, statement of particulars and statement of claim. The reasons for divorce are established in the statement of claim. It is possible to proceed with the divorce proceedings in Singapore without engaging a divorce lawyer. However, the Family Court is not in the position to offer one any advice in this case. Once divorce commence, any forms of disputes raised by the defendant will result in the case being referred to a marriage counsellor. If counselling fails, the involved parties will have to file affidavits of evidence and the judge will then determine if the case will proceed as contested or uncontested divorce. At this point, the judge will pass an interim judgement with a 3 months waiting period. This is to give the involved parties one last chance of reconciliation. When that does not happen, the ancillary process will start. Finally, when the judge deems that the marriage has broken down irretrievably, he will grant the divorce. Only after 3 months from the final decision, then both parties are free to remarry.Divorce Procedures in Singapore. Singapore Divorce Lawyer. Retrieved 21 September 2014. To establish irretrievable breakdown the divorce applicant has to prove one of the following scenarios: * Adultery. * Unreasonable behaviour. * Desertion for 2 years. * Separation for 3 years (and the defendant consents to a divorce). * Separation for 4 years.  Probate  Probate is the process of proving and registering the last will or testament of a deceased person in the Family Justice Courts. This legal document expresses the deceased person wishes as to how their property is to be distributed and names an executor who administers the deceased's estate and handles the disposal of their assets and debts. The executor gets this authority by applying to court to obtain a legal document called Grant of Probate. If a deceased person did not make a Will, then the family members need to apply for Letter of Administration. The person who will a apply is commonly but not always the surviving spouse or eldest child of the deceased. In this case, the assets are distributed according to the Intestate Succession Act.  Adoption  Adoption is a legal process, governed under the Adoption of Children Act (ACA) and the Family Court of Singapore is the authority that decides on adoption applications. The Singapore Adoption of Children Act states: * The parents must be older than 25 years old and at least 21 years older than the adoption child. * Adoptive parent must not be more than 50 years older than the child. * Parent should have sound mental health. * The child must be under 21 years old and a Singapore resident. A foreign-born child may be adopted, but will need to get a Dependant‚Äôs Pass from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sport (MCYS). * Both married couples and singles can adopt a child. However, a single male is not allowed to adopt a girl unless special circumstances exist. * Parents must be Singaporean citizens or permanent residents, or hold passes which the Family Justice Courts deem fit to qualify them as residents in Singapore.

Early implementations involved recovering ostensibly cell-free plasma from the blood of human survivors or from non- human animals deliberately exposed to a specific pathogen or toxin. These approaches resulted in crude purifications of plasma-soluble proteins including antibodies. Antibodies (also known as an immunoglobulins) are complex proteins produced by vertebrates that recognize antigens (or molecular patterns) on pathogens and some dangerous compounds in order to alert the Adaptive immune system that there are pathogens within the body. A plantibody is an antibody that is produced by plants that have been genetically engineered with animal DNA encoding a specific human antibody known to neutralize a particular pathogen or toxin. The transgenic plants produce antibodies that are similar to their human counterparts, and following purification, plantibodies can be administered therapeutically to acutely ill patients or prophylactically to at-risk individuals (such as healthcare workers). The term plantibody and the concept are trademarked by the company Biolex. Production A plantibody is produced by insertion of genes encoding antibodies into a transgenic plant. The plantibodies are then modified by intrinsic plant mechanisms (N-glycosylation).Plantibody (antibody synthesized by plants), Springer Reference. Plantibodies are purified from plant tissues by mechanical disruption and denaturation/removal of intrinsic plant proteins by treatment at high temperature and low pH, as antibodies tend to be stable under these conditions. Antibodies can further be purified away from other acid- and temperature- stable proteins by capture on commercially produced protein A resins. Production of antibodies in whole transgenic plants, such as species in the genus Nicotiana, is cheaper and safer than in cultured animal cells. Advantages Transgenic plants offer an attractive method for large- scale production of antibodies for immunotherapy. Antibodies produced in plants have many advantage that are beneficial to humans, plants, and the economy as well. They can be purified cheaply and in large numbers. The many seeds of plants allow for ample storage, and they have no risk of transmitting diseases to humans because the antibodies are produced without the need of the antigen or infectious microorganisms. Plants could be engineered to produce antibodies which fight off their own plant diseases and pests, for example, nematodes, and eliminate the need for toxic pesticides.  Applications  Antibodies generated by plants are cheaper, easier to manage, and safer to use than those obtained from animals. The applications are increasing because recombinant DNA is very useful in creating proteins that are identical when exposed into a plant's. A recombinant DNA is an artificial DNA that is created by combining two or more sequences that would not normally come together. In this way, DNA injected into a plant is turned into recombinant DNA and manipulated. The favorable properties of plants are likely to make the plant systems a useful alternative for small, medium and large scale production throughout the development of new antibody-based pharmaceuticals. =Medical= The main reason plants are being used to produce antibodies is for treatment of illnesses such as immune disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, given the fact that the plantibodies also have no risk of spreading diseases to humans. In the past 2 decades, research has shown that plant- derived antibodies have become easier to produce. =Commercial= Plantibodies are close to passing clinical trials and becoming approved commercially because of key points. Plants are more economical than most forms of creating antibodies and the technology for harvesting and maintaining them is already present. Plants also reduce the chance of coming in contact with pathogens, making their antibodies safer to use. Plantibodies can be made at an affordable cost and easier manufacturing due to the availability and relatively easy manipulation of genetic information in crops such as potatoes, soybean, alfalfa, rice, wheat and tobacco. Outlook Commercial use is not yet legalized, but clinical trials are underway to implement the use of plantibodies for humans as injections. So far, companies have started conducting human tests of pharmaceutical products, creating plantibodies that include: * Hepatitis B vaccine * Antibody to fight cavity causing bacteria * Antibodies to prevent sexually transmitted diseases * Antibodies for non- Hodgkin's -cell lymphoma * Vaccine against HIV virus * Anthrax vaccine (from tobacco) * Antibodies against Ebola virus By being able to genetically alter plants to create specific antibodies, it is easier to produce antibodies that will fight diseases not only for plants but for human as well. For that reason, plantibody applications will move more towards the medicinal field.

The springs are a national monument since 1964.  History  Local legend goes that the hot springs were discovered in 1850 by a nomadic Nama shepherd rounding up stray sheep.Swaney, Deanna (1995). Lonely Planet: Zimabawe, Botswana & Namibia. 2nd Edition. Published by Hawthorn, Vic. The springs originate deep under the riverbed and form an oasis in the extremely arid area.Swaney, Deanna (1992). Lonely Planet: Zimbabwe, Botswana & Namibia. 1st Edition. Published by Hawthorn, Vic. During the Nama uprising of 1903‚Äì07 the hot spring was used by German military forces as a base camp. In 1915, the area was also used as a base by South African troops who were recovering from wounds during the South West Africa Campaign. In 1962, the spring was leased to a local entrepreneur and were subsequently proclaimed a national monument in 1964. In 1969, the springs became a conservation area and on 16 March 1971, the camp was officially opened. The thermal water has an average temperature of about 60 ¬∞C.Namibia Travel (2009). Ai-Ais/Fish River . Retrieved on 19 May 2009. The water is piped to a series of indoor pools and jacuzzis. Severe floods in 1972, 1974 and 1988 caused the camp to temporarily close. With the exception of one building‚Äîwhich was situated on higher ground‚Äîthe 1972 flood totally destroyed the camp. The Fish River Canyon Conservation area was enlarged in 1987 by the addition of state land west of the canyon. Significant renovations to the Ai-Ais camp were carried out in 1987‚Äì88. An international treaty, signed in 2003, incorporated the vast area around the «ÄAi-«ÄAis Hot Springs and Richtersveld National Park in South Africa, resulting in the establishment of the «ÄAi-«ÄAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.Department of Environmental Affairs & Tourism (2003).

Present day  The springs are a popular holiday destination for Namibian, South African and international holiday-makers. The thermal waters are rich in sulphur, chloride and fluoride, and are reputedly good for anyone suffering from rheumatism. The resort waters are also home to a number of species of fish, including yellowfish and barbel. «ÄAi-«ÄAis is the end point of a 5-day hiking tour through the Fish River Canyon.

Depending on the processor architecture, this can include, but is not limited to: * I/O and peripheral control (such as serial ports or general-purpose IOs) * timers * stack pointer * stack limit (to prevent overflows) * program counter * subroutine return address * processor status (servicing an interrupt, running in protected mode, etc.) * condition codes (result of previous comparisons) Because special registers are closely tied to some special function or status of the processor, they might not be directly writeable by normal instructions (such as adds, moves, etc.). Instead, some special registers in some processor architectures require special instructions to modify them. For example, the program counter is not directly writeable in many processor architectures. Instead, the programmer uses instructions such as return from subroutine, jump, or branch to modify the program counter. For another example, the condition code register might not directly writable, instead being updated only by compare instructions. Intel Processors Some of SFR bits may be set directly using SETB/LDB instructions on proper address, whereas others may require usage of specific instructions. The Intel 80196 class microcontroller has 24 SFRs, each 1 Byte in size; standard Intel 8051 chips have 21 SFRs. The Special Function Register (SFR) is the upper area of addressable memory, from address 0x80 to 0xFF. This area of memory cannot be used for data or program storage, but is instead a series of memory-mapped ports and registers. All port input and output can therefore be performed by memory move operations on specified addresses in the SFR. Also, different status registers are mapped into the SFR, for use in checking the status of the 8051, and changing some operational parameters of the 8051.

Martin was the first Speaker since Sir John Trevor in 1695 to be forced out of office. It was the first Speaker election since 11 May 2005, and the first contested election of a Speaker since 23 October 2000. Conservative MP John Bercow was elected as the new speaker, after three rounds of voting. Rules Voting took place in the House of Commons of the Fifty-Fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom. Under the new rules for the election of the Speaker, introduced in 2001, candidates needed to be nominated by at least twelve Members of Parliament, at least three of them members of a party different from that of the candidate. Each member was allowed to nominate only one candidate. After the candidates' speeches, the House voted by secret ballot, with an absolute majority required for victory. If no candidate won a majority, then the individual with the fewest votes was eliminated, as were any candidates who received less than five per cent of the votes cast. The House continued to vote until one member received the requisite majority under a voting system known as the exhaustive ballot. Then, the House voted on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the Speakership. The Father of the House, Alan Williams, was the presiding officer of the Commons during the election process. The final stage of appointment of a new Speaker is a formality but has constitutional significance. The Queen must signify her approval of the new Speaker, which is done by the appointment of a Royal Commission.\\"How the Speaker will be elected\\", Daily Mail, 22 June 2009.

In Italian, Portuguese and Spanish it exists in masculine and feminine forms: Renato and Renata. In French they have been translated to Ren√© and Ren√©e. Renata is a common female name in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia. The feminine Renate is common in German, Dutch and Norwegian. In Russia the names Renat () (usually as Rinat) and Renata () are widespread among the Tatar population. The name has a spiritual meaning, i.e., to be born again with baptism, i.e., from water and the Holy Spirit. It was extensively adopted by early Christians in ancient Rome, due to the importance of baptism. The onomastic is Saint Renatus, a martyr, Bishop of Sorrento in the 5th century, which is celebrated on October 6. In Persian Mithraism, which spread widely in the West as a religion of the soldiers and officials under the Roman Empire, persons initiated into its mysteries were designated renatus (with the meaning of regenerated). With a completely different origin, the name \\"Renata\\" is a New Zealand Maori transliteration of the name \\"Leonard\\", and is a male's name.

Strategies The Nationalists forces found themselves in a precarious dilemma while conducting this campaign against the Communist forces stemming from complex politico-military situation in the region. Consequently, several actions proved to be grave miscalculations, contributing to their eventual defeat. =Nationalist miscalculations= Like other Nationalist futile attempts to wage guerrilla and insurgency warfare against the Communist forces after evacuation of the Nationalist government to Taipei, the first Nationalist strategic miscalculation made was at least an equal if not larger factor than the enemy's political and military pressure in the Nationalist defeat in this campaign. Immediately after World War II, the Nationalists had neither sufficient forces nor adequate logistical capabilities to secure the Japanese-occupied regions of China; the Nationalist government, unwilling allow these regions to fall into Communist control, ordered the Japanese and their Chinese puppet government not to surrender to the Communists and allowed them to retain their fighting capabilities to 'maintain order' in occupied regions which entailed resisting Communist forces. This decision incurred resentment from the populace in Japanese occupied territory, further eroding local support of the Nationalist government which was already blamed for the allowing the successful Japanese invasion in the first place. Half a decade later as the National Revolutionary Army was driven from mainland China, the Nationalists made another miscalculation in their desperation by enlisting the support of local bandits in the fight the Communists and ordered those Nationalist forces remaining in mainland China to join the bandits in combat against the communism. This decision proved unwise as the bandits were deeply feared and hated by the local populace which they preyed upon, and the sight of Nationalist forces joining the bandits further diminished the support for the Nationalist forces and solidified support for the People's Republic of China. Another strategic miscalculation made by the Nationalists was similar to the one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it attempted to simultaneously address the warlord problem that had plagued China alongside its efforts to combat the growing Communist threat together. The warlords who were allied with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist government were only interested in retaining their power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After the World War II, the forces of the Japanese puppet government realigned with the Nationalist faction, once more with the intention of retain their power as they had when collaborating with the Japanese. It was difficult for Chiang to effectively dispose of these warlords immediately upon their surrender to the Nationalists as such an action would have caused discontent among other Nationalist factions. Furthermore, the former Japanese-aligned warlords could aid the Nationalist cause by retaining control of their territory and combating Communist insurgents. This would have the added benefit of weakening both the Communists and the collaborators. Half a decade later, these bandits the Nationalist government had failed to exterminate were deemed undesirable candidates for evacuation to Taiwan, consequently their use as a force to combat the Communists appeared to be a logical alternative. If the bandits were able to undermine the Communist governance of mainland China, the Nationalist forces would have an advantage in their anticipated counterattack to retake China. On the other hand, if the bandits were subdued by the Communists then the Nationalists would have been spared the task of eradicating the bandit forces after retaking China. However the bandit forces were more interested in keeping their own power than suppressing the communist revolution in China, and thus did not devote any substantial effort to fighting the Communists. Furthermore, the eventual eradication of bandits by the Communist government only served to strengthen its popular support as the Communists had succeeded where previous governments as far back from Qing Dynasty had failed. Yet another strategic error by the Nationalist government involved the Nationalist forces left behind in mainland China. The Nationalist government required high quality and disciplined forces to defend Taiwan, the last Nationalist sanctuary. The forces which mainly comprised the forces of the Nationalist warlord allies were not most the suited to effect the last stand defense the Nationalist were preparing, and such these forces were not given the high priority for evacuation. Instead, these forces were to remain on the mainland and continue to fight the Communists with guerrilla tactics. However this decision angered many of the troops left behind, and it was unlikely that they would fight the Communists with the same vigor as Nationalist forces with political motivation. Compounding this problem, due to the need of bandits' knowledge of the local area, leaders among the bandits were often granted higher ranks than the Nationalist troops left behind. As a result, the Nationalist regulars-turned-guerrillas often were unwilling to work in conjunction to the bandits they were once tasked to exterminate, especially as many of these forces had earlier engaged each other in combat during pacification campaigns. Similarly, the bandits were similarly willing to cooperate and attempted to expend those Nationalist troops when possible in order to spare their comrades. The retreating Nationalist government made another significant error which was financial in nature. Due to the lack of money, those bandits turned guerrillas were mostly provided with arms, but not sufficient supplies and money. The bandits turned guerrilla had no problem of looting the local population to get what they need, as they had done for decades, which inevitably drove the general popular support further into the communist side. The little financial support provided by the nationalist government was simply not enough to support such guerrilla and insurgency warfare on such a large scale. Another unexpected but disastrous result of the insufficient financial support was that it had greatly eroded the support of the nationalist government within its own ranks. The wealthy landowners and businessmen were the strong supporters of nationalist government and as their properties were confiscated by the communists and redistributed to the poor, their hatred toward the communist government was enough to cause many of them to stay behind voluntarily to fight behind the enemy line. However, the landowners and businessmen were also longtime victims of bandits due to their wealth, and many of them had suffered even more than the general populace who had far less wealth. As these former landowners and businessmen turned guerrilla fighters were ordered to join their former bandits who once threatened, looted, kidnapped and even killed them and their relatives, it was obvious that such cooperation was mostly in name only and could not produce any actual benefits, and the alienation and discontent toward the nationalist government harbored by these once ardent nationalists would only grow greater. Another problem for the nationalists was the strong disagreement among themselves over how to fight the war against their communist enemy. Military professionals preferred to fight a total war, incapacitate the enemy's ability to fight, but this inevitably conflicted with the interest of another faction of strong supporters of the nationalist government: the landowners and businessmen, who joined bandits to oppose such tactic. The reason was that landowners and businessmen supporting and joining the nationalist guerrilla firmly believed that the nationalists would be able to retake mainland China within several years and they would be able to regain their lost lands, businesses, and other properties that were confiscated and redistributed to the poor by the communists. As the nationalist military professionals in the guerrilla suggested and destroyed the production facilities and businesses as part of the total war, the landowners and businessmen would not be able to regain any valuable properties after the return of the nationalist government because those properties had been destroyed. The bandits agreed with the businessmen and landowners to oppose the idea of total war for a different reason: when the properties were destroyed and productivity dropped, they would not be able to loot enough supply to survive. As a result, despite the animosities between the bandits and landowners and businessmen, they were united together in the opposition to the military professional faction of the nationalists. =Communist strategies= In contrast to the nationalists, the Communists had much simpler and more effective strategy aided by their lack of the same order of problems as the Nationalists: the Communist forces simply needed to eradicate bandits. The Communist forces exploited Nationalist error to their advantage. As with all other bandit eradication campaigns, the Communist strategy sought to mobilize the victim populations to against the bandits. Furthermore, the Communists were in position to custom tailor specific strategies to combat bandits in specific localities. Campaign Southwestern China had been long plagued by bandits that had continuously existed for centuries. By the time the Nationalist government had lost control in the region in the face of the advancing Communist army, there were over half a million bandits active in the region. In Sichuan alone, there were over three hundred bands of bandits. In Yunnan, there were a hundred forty-eight bands of bandits. In Guizhou, there were five hundred forty-one bands of bandits. In addition large numbers of bandits were also active in Xikang. The number of bandits soon would more than double to more than a million, encouraged by the Nationalist government, which previously had attempted to eradicate them. After the Chengdu campaign concluded in December 1949, many retreating Nationalist military units joined forces with local bandits to continue their struggle against the Communists, but the alliance was a fragile one, and still allowed the Communists to defeat them separately. In February 1950, the Communists made it a top priority to eradicate the bandits. The Communists decided to first eradicate bandits in wealthy areas and regions adjacent to the communication/transportation lines, gradually expanding their efforts into more remote regions. The Communist III Corps, IV Corps, V Corps, XVIII Corps and the 7th Army of the I Corps, totaling to seventeen armies, were deployed for the bandit suppression campaign. From March 1953 onward, the Communists first targeted large bands of bandits with each military formation responsible of pacification of its designated area. Due to the heavy bandit activity in Sichuan, the planned deployment of Communist troops in Tibet was postponed to eradicate bandits first. The 11th Army and the 12th Army, totaling six divisions of the Communist III Corps, were responsible for eradicating bandits in eastern Sichuan. Eight divisions from the 10th Army, 18th Army and 15th Army of the Communist southern Sichuan Military Region were tasked to eradicating bandits in southern Sichuan. Seven divisions of the 60th Army, 62nd Army, and 7th Army of the Western Sichuan Military Region were tasked to eradicate bandits in western Sichuan. The 61st Army was tasked to eradicate bandits in northern Sichuan, and the 62nd Army was tasked to eradicate bandits in Xikang. The 13th Army, 14th Army and units of the 15th Army of the Communist IV Corps were tasked to eradicate bandits in Yunnan. The 16th Army of III Corps was tasked to eradicate bandits in Guizhou. After ten months of fighting, large organized bands of bandits were wiped out by the end of 1950, with over nine hundred thousand bandits annihilated. From 1951 onward, the People's Liberation Army switched their focus to bandits who went into hiding in the remote regions while they continued strengthening the security of warehouses, transportation infrastructure, and communication lines. Large numbers of Communist cadres were sent to strengthen the local garrison and security forces. The main targeted area included the border regions of provinces and border region of counties, remote mountain ranges, and the area near Yunnan ‚Äì Burmese border. From February 1951 to March 1951, the Western Sichuan Military Region successfully eradicated bandits active in Maogong (ÊáãÂäü), and secured the region by stepping up political pressure and mobilizing the local population. The success was approved by Mao Zedong and became an example for the rest to follow. Additionally to better coordinate bandit suppression efforts between different provinces and counties, bandit suppression operations headquarters for joint command were established at the border regions between provinces and counties. In 1951, over two hundred seven thousand bandits were annihilated in Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan and Guizhou. Towns that had been occupied by bandits for more than a year were successfully taken back, including Ceheng (ÂÜå‰∫®), Wango (ÊúõË∞ü), Libo (ËçîÊ≥¢) and Luodian County. Meanwhile, fourteen Communist regiments were deployed to annihilate bandits fled from southwestern China to northwestern China. By the end of 1953, all bandits in southwestern China has been successfully eradicated, with a total of more than one million and a hundred sixty thousands bandits annihilated, over seven hundred artillery pieces and over six hundred thousands rifles captured. The internal conflicts between the bandits and the former Nationalist regulars contributed greatly to the Communist victory, and some female nationalists totaling over thirty thousands had suffered grave personal tragedies in the campaign: refusing to surrender to the Communists after that nationalist governments collapsed in the unstoppable Communist advance, many Nationalists opted to continue their fight by joining bandits in the hope of forming a united front to wage the guerrilla war against the war, as the retreating Nationalist government had directed. However many bandits took the opportunity to settle old scores with the Nationalist government they once fought. Over thirty thousand female Nationalists who attempted to join bandits were treated as enemies. These female nationalists were brutally raped and tortured by the bandits, afterward, they were sold to minorities in the remote regions as sex slaves. It was not until 1956 that the last of these unfortunate women were finally rescued from slavery and finally returned home. Outcome Although they shared a common anticommunist goal, the Nationalist guerrilla warfare campaign was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought Nationalist troops in the earlier pacification campaigns, and looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the Nationalist government. But their union against their common enemy was half-hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further were additional differences within the ranks of the Nationalist guerrillas themselves. The futile Nationalist guerrilla campaign failed in the face of the expanding Communist state.

Crocodiles swim & live in all areas in the Johnstone River Course and features The North and South Johnstone Rivers rise in the tablelands of the north tropical coast and flow through steep narrow gorges to their junction on the coastal plain at Innisfail. The head waters of the catchments are located in high rainfall areas and the rivers are capable of producing severe flooding, especially in the Innisfail area. The North and South Johnstone Rivers have a combined catchment area of about at Innisfail; with the North Johnstone being the larger of the two with a catchment of about . Major tributaries of the river system include the North Beatrice River and the Ithaca River that both flow into the North Johnstone River. This branch is the longest and its catchment is drawn from the Malanda Falls Conservation Park, and the following national parks: Ella Bay, Eubenangee Swamp, Herberton Range, Japoon, Malaan, Palmerston Rocks, Topaz Road, Tully Falls, Tully Gorge and Wooroonooran. Malanda Falls is located in the upper reaches of the North Johnstone River. Downey Creek is the only major tributary on the South Johnstone River. There are no dams or reservoirs in the catchment area. However water is taken from the river for town water supply, dairy farming and sugar cane production. The river is subject to periodic flooding (On the 8th of March 2018 the Johnstone burst its banks cutting off Innisfail from Cairns) popular for white-water rafting, and other tourist activities. History 1872 map of the Gladys River (Johnstone River) showing Mamu settlements The junction of the two river branches is considered to be a sacred area to the indigenous Mamu people. This area had a relatively high density population before British colonisation, with a number of camps and villages along the banks. The area was first infiltrated by colonial Europeans in 1872. Robert Johnstone of the Native Police was conducting a series of punitive expeditions after the killing of several crew members of the shipwreck Maria when the river was named the Gladys by Captain Morseby. It was reported that Johnstone's missions resulted in the deaths of 93 Aboriginal people. Later, in 1873, Dalrymple named the river after Johnstone while he was on an expedition searching for an alternative port for the Palmer River goldfields. Robert Johnstone was along on both trips as the sub-inspector in charge of the Native Mounted Police at Cardwell. In 1881 the first sugar cane plantation and mill were established at Innisfail after G. E. Dalrymple reported suitable land on the Johnstone River. Crossings The Jubilee Bridge was built across the river at Innisfail in 1923, replacing a ferry service. The old Jubilee Bridge was closed on 21 May 2010 after a review found the bridge to be unsafe. A new bridge was opened on 2 September 2011 with a ceremony attended by the then Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, Queensland MP Curtis Pitt and local Mayor Bill Shannon. The opening of the railway bridge across the North Johnstone river at Daradgee in December 1924 provided the final link in the North Coast railway line from Townsville to Cairns. The North Johnstone River also has two crossings on the Bruce Hwy and Shaw Rd.

Vandeveld Darrel Vandeveld (born 1960) is an American lawyer with years of service as an infantry officer, including a Bronze Star from Operation Desert Storm, and JAG Officer in the United States Army Reserve. After resigning from GITMO due to ethical reasons related to the prosecution of Mohamed Jawad, he was refused promotion. Despite his having numerous years and deployments in the military, both as a soldier and lawyer, receiving many decorations and commendations for his performance, the promotions board passed him over. This occurred after he submitted a 4-page declaration detailing his experience at GITMO, in which he had witnessing severe illegal activity from US military and politicians. After nearly 30 years of service, Vandeveld retired from the Reserve at the rank of LTC (Lieutenant Colonel). Vandeveld is notable for asking to resign from his appointment as a prosecutor before a Guantanamo military commission. According to the New York Times, officials confirmed on September 24, 2008, that, Lieutenant Colonel Vandeveld resigned over an ethical issue. Vandeveld is the seventh prosecutor to resign from serving as a Guantanamo prosecutor. Vandeveld was serving as a prosecutor in the case of Mohamed Jawad, a Pakistani youth who was charged with participating in a grenade attack in a bazaar in Afghanistan. Colonel Stephen R. Henley had been growing impatient with the prosecution, and had given them a deadline to share evidence they had withheld from defense attorney Major David J. R. Frakt, which he suspected could prove exculpatory. The BBC reports that the withheld evidence includes the confessions of two men who said they were the ones who actually made the attack. Vandeveld's resignation was filed within the Military Commission system. The New York Times reported he had not commented publicly about his resignation. Carol Rosenberg, of the Miami Herald, quoted from Vandeveld's four-page resignation memo: Frakt claimed that Vandeveld had recommended a plea bargain and an early release for Jawad, who was a youth when the event took place. Held by the United States since 2002, he had been subjected to coercive \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\", including prolonged sleep deprivation in Guantanamo's frequent flyer program. Frakt commented that Vandeveld: \\"could no longer continue to serve ethically as a prosecutor.\\" Chief Prosecutor Colonel Lawrence Morris asserted: Morris' denigration of Vandeveld's claims was later refuted by the Bush administration, which admitted, as Vandeveld had contended, that the detainee prosecution files remained in a state of disarray, some six years after the Commissions had first been formed. Morris retired from the US Army within months after these revelations. He has since been appointed to a position created by the US Army JAG Corps for Morris upon his retirement: \\"Chief of Trial Advocacy.\\" According to Josh Meyer, writing in the Los Angeles Times, Frakt planned to call Vandeveld as a witness on September 25 or 26, 2008. Vandeveld was willing to testify. But his superiors planned to block his testimony. According to Meyers, Frakt planned to ask Henley, the Presiding Officer, to compel Vandeveld's testimony. Robert Preston Major Robert Preston is a lawyer, and an officer in the United States Air Force. Together with Captain John Carr and USAF Captain Carrie Wolf, Preston was among the military lawyers tasked to serve as prosecutors of the suspected terrorists imprisoned at the American Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. All three military lawyers requested transfers to other assignments because they had concerns that the proceedings would be innately unjust. These memos were leaked to the press. On August 1, 2005, the Australian newspaper, The Age published an article based on the leaked memos. It quoted Preston's memo: The article quoted Brigadier General Thomas Hemingway, another military lawyer, who served as a legal adviser to the Office of Military Commissions. He had tried to dismiss the memos as based on simple misunderstandings by the officers. Following an official investigation, the Chief Prosecutor, Colonel Fred Borch, to whom the memos were addressed, subsequently resigned from the military. In the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the United States Supreme Court found that the then-existing military commissions, created within the executive branch, lacked \\"the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions.\\" It said they were unconstitutional because they had not been authorized by Congress and were set up only within the executive branch. John Carr Major John Carr is an officer and judge advocate in the United States Air Force. Then-Captain Carr and fellow Air Force judge advocates Major Robert Preston and Captain Carrie Wolf were among the military lawyers assigned to prosecute the suspected terrorists imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

On August 1, 2005, The Age, published an article based on leaked memos. Quoted were comments from Carr's memos: Although Brigadier General Thomas Hemingway, a legal adviser to the Office of Military Commissions, tried to dismiss the memos as based on simple misunderstandings, an official investigation was conducted. The Chief Prosecutor to whom the memos were addressed, Colonel Fred Borch, subsequently resigned from the military. Carrie Wolf Captain Carrie Wolf is an officer and judge advocate in the United States Air Force. Wolf, Major Robert Preston, and Captain John Carr were among the military lawyers assigned to prosecute the suspected terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

On August 1, 2005, The Age, published an article based on the leaked memos from Preston and Carr. On August 3, 2005, The Age published another article that said Wolf had shared the concerns of the other two officers, and had also requested a transfer.

Personal life Collingwood Ingram was a son of Sir William Ingram and Mary Eliza Collingwood , daughter of Australian politician Edward Stirling.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 2003, vol. 2, pg 2048Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 He was a grandson of Herbert Ingram, founder of The Illustrated London News. Sir William Ingram succeeded Herbert as the owner of the paper, and was a brother of Bruce Ingram, editor from 1900‚Äì1963. Collingwood's uncle, Sir Edward Charles Stirling, was a noted anthropologist, physiologist and museum director, with a great interest in the natural world. On 17 October 1906, Collingwood married Florence Maude Laing, only child of Henry Rudolph Laing, they had four children. In the First World War, he was first commissioned in the Kent Cyclist Battalion and was later a compass officer with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force. In the Second World War, he was commander of his local Home Guard in Benenden, Kent. He was a collector of Japanese art, especially netsuke, and left his collection to the British Museum. Ornithology In the early 1900s, Sir William Ingram employed Wilfred Stalker to collect bird skins in Australia for Collingwood to identify and catalogue at the London Natural History Museum, resulting in his first major publication.On the birds of the Alexander district, Northern territory of South Australia, Ibis, 387‚Äì415, 1907 In 1907 he collected in Japan and for his work thereOrnithological notes from Japan, Ibis, 129‚Äì169, 1908 he was made an Honorary Member of the Ornithological Society of Japan. However his main interest was in the field study of birds; he made the first record of marsh warblers breeding in Kent.On the nesting of the marsh warbler in Kent, Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club, 15, 96, 1905 He was an accomplished bird artist.Many examples of his work are shown at http://erniepollard.jimdo.com His planned book on the birds of France was interrupted by the War and never completed, although part emerged as Birds of the Riviera in 1926. His 1916‚Äì18 journals record his war experiences and also his off-duty bird observations, with many sketches made behind the lines in northern France. His published war diaries are packed with his pencil sketches of birds, people and landscapes. He interrogated pilots, including Charles Portal, on the height at which birds fly, resulting in a short paper after the War. He was member of the British Ornithologists' Union for a record 81 years. Plant collecting and gardening After the First World War, horticulture took over from ornithology as Collingwood Ingram's dominant interest. He created his famous garden at The Grange in Benenden and collected plants across the world. His outstanding plant-collecting trips were to Japan in 1926 and South Africa in 1927. By 1926, he was a world authority on Japanese cherries and was asked to address the Cherry Society in Japan on their national tree. It was on this visit that he was shown a painting of a beautiful white cherry, then thought to be extinct in Japan. He recognised it as one he had seen in a moribund state in a Sussex garden, the result of an early introduction from Japan. He had taken cuttings and so was able to re-introduce it to the gardening world as ‚ÄòTaihaku‚Äô, the name meaning 'Great White Cherry'. His 1948 book Ornamental Cherries is a standard work. In March 2016, a book on his contribution to the survival of Japanese cherries was published in Japan. The author is Naoko Abe, the publisher Iwanami Shoten. An English version with the title Cherry Ingram: the Englishman who saved Japan's Blossoms is out in March 2019 together with the American version The Sakura Obsession. This book recounts the important, almost central, role of cherries in the history and culture of Japan, and describes Ingram's contribution. He introduced many Japanese and other species of cherries to the United Kingdom, as well as his own hybrids. Ingram introduced many new garden plants, including Prunus √ó incam ‚ÄòOkam√©‚Äô (Prunus incisa √ó Prunus campanulata), Rubus √ó tridel ‚ÄòBenenden‚Äô (Rubus deliciosus √ó Rubus trilobus) and the Rosemary ‚ÄòBenenden Blue‚Äô, a natural variant of Rosmarinus officinalis which he collected in Corsica. He also raised many Rhododendron and Cistus hybrids. An avenue of his 'Asano' cherry is one of the features of Kew Gardens. As one of many generous acts, he gave a cherry plant to each of the Walkhurst cottages on Walkhurst Road, Benenden. One of the resulting cherry trees still stands along this road.

The scarcity and ambiguity of records of \\"VI Hispana\\" has led some scholars to doubt that this legion ever existed and that the inscriptions attesting it were erroneous references to the legions VII Gemina or IX Hispana.Seyrig (1923) 488  Sources  The extant records attesting a \\"Legio VI Hispana\\" are as follows: # AE (2003) 1014 and 7 other similar inscriptions from Corinth honouring Tiberius Claudius Dinippus, who is described as a military tribune of \\"VI Hispana\\" (also called \\"VI Hispanensis\\" in 3 of the inscr.).

Lucius Septimius Cassianus, standard-bearer of the legion IIIIII Hispana, acting in the lustrum of chief centurion Publius Porcius Faustus, freely fulfilled his vow to the well- deserving [god].\\" Date: AD 244-8.EAGLE (Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy)  Legion lists  It appears certain that no \\"VI Hispana\\" existed during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193‚Äì211). Two lists of the legions in being survive from this era, one inscribed on a column found in Rome () and the other a list of legions in existence \\"today\\" provided by the contemporary Greco-Roman historian Dio Cassius, writing ca. 210-232 (\\"Roman History\\" LV.23-4). Both these lists date from after 197, as both include the 3 Parthica legions founded by Severus in that year. Both lists provide an identical list of 33 legions. Therefore, if a VI Hispana ever did exist, it must have been either before or after Severus' reign.  Theories  Mistaken identity = Theodor Mommsen, the 19th century German classicist, argued that the \\"IIIIII Hispana\\" of the Cassianus inscription was a misspelling of IX Hispana. This legion was sometimes written \\"VIIII Hispana\\". The mason may have mistakenly engraved \\"II\\" instead of \\"V\\".Seyrig (1923) 488 But there was (in 2015) no other evidence of the existence of IX Hispana later than 120. Sauveur argued (in 1918) that the tile-stamps of VI Hispana were in reality a mistake for VII Gemina, which from AD 70 till the 4th century was the sole imperial legion permanently based in Hispania.Seyrig (1923) 489 Sauveur also attributed the Brescia inscription to the VI Victrix, which was in Hispania for about a century (29 BC ‚Äì AD 70) and may have acquired the \\"Hispana\\" title from this time. But there is no supporting evidence that VI Victrix was ever known by this name.Seyrig (1923) 489 = Early VI Hispana (1st/2nd centuries) = According to Seyrig (1923), the evidence is sufficient to prove that VI Hispana existed. Seyrig argues that VI Hispana was levied in present-day Northern Spain by the general Servius Sulpicius Galba in AD 68 to participate in his coup d'√©tat against the emperor Nero. Seyrig cites Suetonius that Galba \\"raised from the people of his province (Hispania Tarraconensis) legions and auxiliary regiments additional to his existing forces of one legion [VI Victrix] and [5 auxiliary regiments]\\".Suetonius Galba X But Dio Cassius records that Galba founded only VII Gemina and the I Adiutrix.Dio Cassius LV.24 Seyrig suggests that VI Hispana (or at least a detachment of it) was deployed in Dacia sometime in the period 70-150. Finally, Seyrig argues, VI Hispana disappeared during the 2nd century, before 197.Seyrig (1923) 496 However, Seyrig's theory relied on dating of the source inscriptions which are not favoured today. Seyrig dates the Dinippus inscription to ca. 150, much later than the period 54‚Äì68 given in Epigraphik Datenbank. Also Seyrig considers the Cassianus inscription to date from before 197. This is unlikely, as Cassianus' first names, Lucius Septimius, show that he (or his forebears) acquired Roman citizenship under the emperor Septimius Severus (or one of his successors) i.e. in 193 at the earliest. Furthermore, the Cassianus inscription has been dated to the reign of Philip the Arab (r. 244‚Äì9) on stylistic and content grounds.EAGLE (Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy) The other main objection to Seyrig's thesis is that no further records of \\"VI Hispana\\" have been found since 1923, despite almost a century of intensive archaeological excavation of Roman military sites across Europe and the discovery of tens of thousands of Roman inscriptions. This seems implausible for an imperial legion active in the 1st and 2nd centuries. = Late VI Hispana (3rd century) = The dating of Cassianus to the reign of emperor Philip the Arab (244‚Äì9) has given rise to the theory that a legion VI Hispana was founded under the Severan dynasty (193‚Äì235), or even later, and was destroyed during the Empire's Third Century Crisis, possibly at the Battle of Abrittus (251), where an entire Roman army was annihilated. The epithet \\"Hispana\\" probably indicates that the legion's initial recruits were Spaniards. The main difficulty with this theory is that Dio Cassius does not include a \\"VI Hispana\\" in his list of legions existing at his time of writing (210-235). If VI Hispana was founded after Dio completed his history (or after he died) the omission would be explained. In this case, VI Hispana may have been raised during the reigns of Alexander Severus (r. 222-35), Maximinus I (r. 235-8) or even Philip himself. The lack of other evidence is not necessarily fatal to its plausibility, as the 3rd century saw a huge diminution in the frequency of inscriptions compared to the two preceding centuries. Furthermore, if the legion was founded around in the period 230-44 and destroyed in 251, its existence lasted only a decade or two, explaining the lack of more evidence. = Conclusion = The existence of a legion called \\"VI Hispana\\" remains doubtful. Seyrig's thesis appears unsustainable due to lack of sufficient evidence. A third century VI Hispana, however, is a possibility, though dependent on a single record (and its dating).

He is credited, along with Harry Rigby with having conceived of the Tony Award-winning musical comedy Sugar Babies, a tribute to the burlesque era. In 1965, Allen was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in the category of Humanities.  Biography  Ralph Gilmore Allen was born on January 7, 1934 in Philadelphia. As a teenager, he and his friends went to see burlesque shows. For his friends, the appeal of the burlesque show was the scantily-clad women, but Allen was more interested in the bawdy humor. Allen received his bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1955 and his Doctor of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama in 1960. It was at Yale than Allen met his wife, Harriet Nichols. Allen died at the age of 70 in New York City on September 9, 2004.  Career  In 1965, Allen was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Theatre Arts. From 1965 through 1968, Allen served as an editor for the academic journal Theatre Survey. Allen served as artistic director at the Victoria Fair Theatre from 1968 to 1972. From 1972 through 1978, Allen was the chairman of the theatre department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. While at the University of Tennessee, he also served as the artistic director of the Clarence Brown company, a professional theatre company in residence at the university.  Works  Allen is best known for having conceived, along with Harry Rigby, the musical comedy Sugar Babies. Allen had traveled around the United States interviewing elderly comedians and taking down their comedy sketches. He wrote a revue, which would later become Sugar Babies, based on his collection of approximately 5000 comedy sketches. The show opened on October 8, 1979, and ran for 1208 performances before closing on August 28, 1982. Allen's other plays include a rendition of Rip van Winkle, co-authored by Joshua Logan in 1976, The Tax Collector in 1977, and Honky Tonk Nights, a 1986 collaboration with David Campbell.

It is raised in the Soƒça valley in Slovenia, in the areas of Resia and Tarvisio in Friuli in Italy, and in Styria and Carinthia in Austria. The breed is raised for milk and for meat. Characteristics The Bovec may be whitish, or in about 30% of cases, black or brown. They have small ears, short, thin legs, and their belly is bare. The back legs are inclined forward so that they can walk on steep meadows easily. Height of rams is and ewes at the withers. A breeding ewe provides approximately 1.23 lambs per litter, lactates for 210 days and in that time yields of milk with 6.3% fat. Numbers In 2012 a population in Slovenia of 3500 was reported to DAD- IS. Other sources estimate the number of pure-bred examples there at 1200. The Krainer Steinschaf population in Austria was reported to be in the range 2719‚Äì4000 in 2012.

These have included Julius Caesar in October 2007, and Monkey! as part of the Capital of Culture Year programme in 2008. The group was closely involved in the development of Frank Cottrell- Boyce's Proper Clever, his first script for the stage which was produced at the Playhouse in October 2008. Senior members of the Youth Theatre presented their first studio production, Timberlake Wertenbaker's The Love of the Nightingale, at the Everyman Theatre in 2009.

Lunar regolith simulants are used by researchers who wish to research the materials handling, excavation, transportation, and uses of lunar regolith. Samples of actual lunar regolith are too scarce, and too small, for such research. Early simulants In the run-up to the Apollo program, crushed terrestrial rocks were first used to simulate the anticipated soils that astronauts would encounter on the lunar surface. In some cases the properties of these early simulants were substantially different from actual lunar soil, and the issues associated with the pervasive, fine-grained sharp dust grains on the Moon came as a surprise. Later simulants After Apollo and particularly during the development of the Constellation program, there was a large proliferation of lunar simulants produced by different organizations and researchers. Many of these were given three-letter acronyms to distinguish them (e.g., MLS-1, JSC-1), and numbers to designate subsequent versions. These simulants were broadly divided into highlands or mare soils, and were usually produced by crushing and sieving analogous terrestrial rocks (anorthosite for highlands, basalt for mare). Returned Apollo and Luna samples were used as reference materials in order to target specific properties such as elemental chemistry or particle size distribution. Many of these simulants were criticized by prominent lunar scientist Larry Taylor for a lack of quality control and wasted money on features like nanophase iron that had no documented purpose. =JSC-1 and -1A= JSC-1 (Johnson Space Center Number One) was a lunar regolith simulant that was developed in 1994 by NASA and the Johnson Space Center. Its developers intended it to approximate the lunar soil of the maria. It was sourced from a basaltic ash with a high glass content. In 2005, NASA contracted with Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) for a second batch of simulant in three grades:http://isru.msfc.nasa.gov/lib/workshops/2009/03_JSC-1A_Lunar_RegSimulant_Update_BGustafson.pdf * JSC-1AF, fine, 27 ¬µm average size * JSC-1A, a reproduction of JSC 1, less than 1 mm size * JSC-1AC, coarse, a distribution of sizes < 5 mm NASA received 14 metric tons of JSC-1A, and one ton each of AF and AC in 2006. Another 15 tons of JSC-1A and 100 kg of JSC-1F were produced by ORBITEC for commercial sale, but ORBITEC is no longer selling simulants and was acquired by the Sierra Nevada Corporation. An 8-ton sand box of commercial JSC‚Äê1A is available for daily rental from the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI).NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) JSC-1A can geopolymerize in an alkaline solutions resulting in a hard, rock-like, material.Montes, Broussard, Gongre, Simicevic, Mejia, Tham, Allouche, Davis; Evaluation of lunar regolith geopolymer binder as a radioactive shielding material for space exploration applications, Adv.

JSC MARS-1A) dust simulants produced at the University of Birmingham JSC-1 and JSC-1A are now no longer available outside of NASA centers. =NU-LHT and OB-1= Two lunar highlands simulants, the NU-LHT (lunar highlands type) series and OB-1 (olivine- bytownite) were developed and produced in anticipation of the Constellation activities. Both of these simulants are sourced mostly from rare anorthosite deposits on the Earth. For NU-LHT the anorthosite came from the Stillwater complex, and for OB-1 it came from the Shawmere Anorthosite in Ontario. Neither of these simulants were widely distributed. Recent simulants Most of the previously developed lunar simulants are no longer being produced or distributed outside of NASA. Multiple companies have tried to sell regolith simulants for profit, including Zybek Advanced Products, ORBITEC, and Deep Space Industries. None of these efforts have seen much success. NASA is unable to sell simulants, or distribute unlimited amounts for free; however, NASA can award set amounts of simulant to grant winners. Several lunar simulants have been developed recently and are either being sold commercially or are available for rent inside large regolith bins. These include the OPRL2N Standard Representative Lunar Mare SimulantOPRL2N Standard Representative Lunar Mare Simulant and Standard Representative Lunar Highland Simulant.OPRH2N Standard Representative Lunar Highland Simulant Off Planet Research also produces customized simulants for specific locations on the Moon including lunar polar icy regolith simulants that include the volatiles identified in the LCROSS mission.

The megalith was in good condition until a farmer from Turton sledgehammered the circle in the 1870s. According to an article published in 1829, Cheetham Close was once a druidical ritual place and a Roman road passed 'within two hundred yards' of the megalith. The stone circle at Cheetham Close measured about in diameter. Six stones are definitely part of the circle and other smaller stones are scattered about the place. The monument has been damaged, and the stones fractured. Archaeological surveys A plan of Cheetham Close taken in 1871. The area was surveyed in 1850 by Dryden, who identified a circle of six stones. In 1871 Greenhalgh identified a seventh stone and drew attention to the destruction of the site. In 1894 French discovered a second site which was a \\"ring bank\\" type cairn. A saddle quern was found in 1954 and the site was scheduled in 1958. Three barbed and tanged arrowheads were found at a third site in 1959. In 1983 a large-scale survey was undertaken by the Bury Archaeological Group and M. Fletcher. The stone circle was in a severely damaged state, with only two of the seven megaliths still in situ. The site probably originally contained ten equally spaced gritstone slabs. The ring cairn lies to the south of the stone circle. Fletcher suggests that Cheetham Close dates from an early period between 2100 and 1500 BC in the Early Bronze Age. The quern and arrowheads suggest the settlers were a pastoral community who supplemented their diet by hunting.

Youth and schooling Gregor Zerjav was born in Lo≈æ in Inner Carniola, Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). He studied law at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1906. Political career In 1908, Gregor Zerjav became the chief coordinator of the National Progressive Party in Carniola. Despite his young age, he became one of the main financial advisors of the Slovene national liberal political establishment. In 1910, he became notorious for his involvement in the bankruptcy of the Agro Merkur credit bank, established a few years earlier as a financial institution supporting the National Progressive Party.Igor Grdina, Slovenci med tradicijo in perspektivo (Ljubljana: ≈†tudentska zalo≈æba, 2003), 198.

He was released after less than a month. In May 1915, when his colleague Bogumil Vo≈°njak fled to the west in order to join the Yugoslav Committee, ≈Ωerjav was again arrested and put into custody in the town of Gmund and later in Graz, where he spent most of the war. After the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ≈Ωerjav was part of the delegation of Austro-Hungarian South Slavs which in December 1918 signed the declaration establishing the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After 1918, ≈Ωerjav became a fervent supporter of Yugoslav centralism and unitarism. In June 1918, he was among the co-founders of the Yugoslav Democratic Party, which in 1919 merged into the State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats. He was elected to the Yugoslav parliament for three consecutive terms, in 1920, 1925, and 1927 (the first time as representative of the Democratic Party, and the last two on the list of the Independent Democratic Party.

It was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Activision in North America and Europe. The game features a racing style that incorporates real world cars and locales with arcade style handling and vehicular combat. Blur was the penultimate game developed by Bizarre Creations before they were shut down by Activision on February 18, 2011. Gameplay In Blurs career mode, the player will encounter numerous characters and many licensed cars ranging from Dodge Vipers to Lotus Exiges to Ford Transit and vans fitted with F1 engines, all of which have full damage modeling and separate traits such as Acceleration, Speed, Drift, Grip and Stability. Some special car models have been designed by Bizarre Creations themselves. Albeit simplified, the tracks are also based on real-world environments, such as the Los Angeles river canals and several parts of London. Depending on the character(s) the player races against or tags along with in team races, they will have their own racing styles, power- up setups, match types, locales and cars. As the player reaches the podium in races, performs stunts and uses power-ups in certain ways, they will gain 'fan points'. These points help the player progress through the career, purchase more cars and parts and earn more fans for the user base. Also, during the career, players will encounter fan icons along the tracks. Driving through these will trigger short challenges (e.g. shooting another car with a certain weapon, or performing a long drift), which will reward the player with a fan points boost. During the career mode, each challenge features a final boss, which, once defeated will yield access to their specific mods (mods being upgrades that provide enhanced functionality to a standard powerup e.g. Khan's titanium shield), and customized cars. At the final boss challenge, all the bosses meet together for a final race. A trailer and tips video for the game on Xbox Live mentioned a feature that never made it to the final game. The feature, called \\"double tap\\", was meant to allow a player to combine several powerups of the same type for a more powerful effect, by double tapping the special power use button. The video was removed near the release of the game and little, if any, mention of the feature, seems to have been made again. The \\"double tap\\" feature was not present in the free multiplayer demo of the game offered on Xbox Live. =Multiplayer= The game can be played with up to four players in split screen, and the game can be taken online for a maximum of 20 players over the internet, or over LAN in the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions. In a custom game, options can be set before each match that determine the layout of power-ups, car classes, number of laps, and the track to race. A match type called \\"World Tour\\" is essentially a quick play option for players who want to jump into a match. Here, every player is given a random car and thrown into a random series of courses with a standard ruleset. Multiplayer also offers \\"Team Racing\\" mode. Two teams (Alpha & Omega) can put themselves head to head either publicly or private. During races, each player accumulates points for their finishing position. While in team racing, powerups will not affect the player's own team members with the exception of Shock. Players can send a racing challenge to an online friend. If the second player beats the time, they can send the updated challenge back. These challenges go back and forth until one person concedes. Players can also use the Share button, and post their achievements to Twitter and Facebook. Reception The game was very well received overall by critics, with a Metacritic score of 82/100 on the Xbox 360 and an 81/100 on the PlayStation 3 and PC. =Sales= In the US, Blur sold 31,000 copies in its first five days of release according to the NPD. Despite disappointing sales, Nick Davies of Bizarre Creations had announced in July 2010 that the studio intended to create more games in the series, and wanted to make it the biggest racing franchise. He attributed the sales performance of Blur, to the fact that the game was released at \\"a very busy time for racing games\\", and that it \\"came out at the same time as ModNation Racers and Split/Second.\\" However, he believed \\"that the strong multiplayer component would give the game staying power\\", and \\"it's going to be a slow-burner\\". On February 18, 2011, Activision announced that it was closing Bizarre Creations, stating: > Over the past three years since our purchase of Bizarre Creations, the > fundamentals of the racing genre have changed significantly. Although we > made a substantial investment in creating a new IP, Blur, it did not find a > commercial audience. Bizarre is a very talented team of developers, however, > because of the broader economic factors impacting the market, we are > exploring our options regarding the future of the studio, including a > potential sale of the business. Sequels A sequel was planned for Blur, and work had started on it using an all-new engine, but it was cancelled when Bizarre Creations was shut down by Activision. Work-in-progress videos of the intended sequel were released post- mortem, one of which show a race in Blurs Brighton track, adding a rainstorm, another that shows an Audi R8 racing in a track set in Dubai, showcasing the ability to temporarily run sideways on the side of a curved building, and another of an Ultima GTR racing down a snow-capped mountain during an avalanche. On October 25, 2013 a free-to-play spin-off mobile game called Blur Overdrive was released on Android, developed by Nottingham based App Crowd, and distributed by Marmalade, who licensed the Blur brand from Activision. An iOS version was released on November 1, 2013. Blur: Overdrive uses a top-down perspective and features eight different power-ups and six cars, which can be upgraded individually in ten steps. Touchscreen controls allow to choose from a floating steering wheel, a slide bar or a virtual pad. Player mods and Power Up mods are not connected to the car upgrading system and change how power-ups influence the combat.

It is located near the border with Turkmenistan in western Uzbekistan, north-west of Urgench, north of Shovot, and south of the Amu Darya river. Gurlen is a major centre for cotton production, and rice and yams are also significant other crops. History Gurlen was one of the medieval cities of Khorezm. A fortress was built about north of Gurlen called Taza Vazir (\\"New Vazir\\"). The Hanafi jurist of Khwarezm, Jalal ad-Din Kurlani, is from Gurlen. In the early 19th century, it was a well-known merchant city of the Khanate of Khiva. Gurlen featured a New Method school from 1905 to 1911 which encountered extreme conservative opposition. In the 1820s, it was a well-known merchant city of Khiva Khanate.–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤ –¢—É—Ä–∫–º–µ–Ω–∏—é –∏ –•–∏–≤—É –≤ 1819 –∏ 1820 –≥–æ–¥–∞—Ö –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞ –∫–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –ú—É—Ä–∞–≤—å–µ–≤–∞, –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤ —Å–∏–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã –¥–ª—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤. –ú., 1822, —Å.32 After the 1917 Russian Revolution the Khanate of Khiva was abolished, and Gurlen was eventually included into the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Bukhara, characterized as the nucleus of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, contained the part of Khorezm located within a triangle formed by Gurlen-Khiva-Pitniyak. Gurlen was a part of Khorezm Oblast, which was abolished on September 29, 1926, and the center of Gurlen District. After 1926, Gurlen and the district were directly subordinated to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. On October 1, 1938 Khorezm Oblast was re-established. It included Gurlen, which at the time had a status of rural locality, and Gurlen District. It was classified as a rural locality until October 1981, when under Soviet rule it was granted urban-type settlement status. In 1984, Gurlen was granted town status and became the town of oblast significance, meaning it was not a part of the district any more. A children's hospital was built here during the Soviet period. Geography and climate Gurlen is located in southern Uzbekistan, near the border with Turkmenistan. It is north-west of Urgench, north of Shavat, and south of the Amu Darya river. Nearby settlements include Ishandami to the southeast, Mangityap to the northwest, and Pakhtachi and Chkalova nearby to the west. The Yangiabadskoe deposit, noted for rock in native slate which is used for brick manufacture, is situated to the west of Gurlen. The climatic condition of the semi desertic region of Gurten is of extreme continental climate. As the annual incidence of rainfall is more than the rate of evaporation, irrigation is an essential requirement for cultivation in this part of Uzbekistan. Economy Gurlen District is a major centre for cotton production (mainly for export) and the town is known for its cotton ginneries. Other crops include rice, yams and wheat (introduced in 1990 for self-sufficiency in food), and when wheat is not grown during winter, other crops are grown such as maize, sorghum, water melons, melons, and vegetables. The Uzbek government had stated that rice should not be grown in areas near the desert, but rice fields are apparent in the vicinity of Gurlen, and it forms the bulk of land use. Irrigation in the area from damming the Amu Darya (Oxus River) which flows nearby, as part of the Amu Darya Irrigation System, has much improved agricultural production, and a number of Koreans were sent to farms in Gurlen during the Soviet era to convert the border desert areas of Kara Kum into fertile lands. Gurlen is a notable bread producer. Gurlen has a shoe factory which is a Joint-Stock Company called the ‚ÄúKhorasm Poiafzali‚Äù, or Garlen Shoe Factory. It was established in 1988. Shoes are manufactured from raw materials, particularly leather. Transactions are carried out in English. Several banks are located in the town centre including the Agro Bank, Xalq Bank and the Gurlen Milliy Bank. There is a large-scale poultry farm in Gurlen. Demographics As of the 1989 Census, Gurlen had a population of 19,807. Uzbek is the state language, although the regional Kipchak Khorezm language is also spoken by some in Gurlen. Residents are involved in professional trades of weaving, pottery, jewellery, baking, crafts and agricultural practices.). Khiva is the major city centre close to this town. The garment worn by the people is known as Khivan dona, which is an outer garment, and the other garment of general use is Urgen chapan. Musicians from the town are also well known in the country.

An American‚ÄìChinese co-production, the film was almost entirely shot and filmed in Beijing and follows two Americans who find love in China. It was screened at multiple film festivals in 1998 and 1999 before receiving a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2000 and a DVD release on December 4, 2001. Restless was criticized for its clich√©d and undelivered storylines, but praised for its scenery.  Plot  Leah (Kellner) is a translator who is traveling international cities in search of romance and closure with her estranged boyfriend Jeff. She eventually settles in Beijing, China, where she meets and develops a fixation on Master Sun Zhan (Geng Le), who teaches here a Chinese game called weiqi. When her relationship with Master Sun Zhan takes a turn for the worse, Leah decides to focus on getting revenge on Jeff. Richard (Wu) is a shiftless Chinese-American whose family sends him to Beijing with his grandfather's ashes. Eventually Leah and Richard's paths cross. Cast *Catherine Kellner as Leah Quinn, an American expat working for China Daily *David Wu as Richard Kao, a second-generation Chinese-American *Chen Shiang- chyi as Lin Qingqing *Geng Le as Sun Zhan, a weiqi master with the rank of 8 dan *Sarita Choudhury as Jane Talwani *Josh Lucas as Jeff Hollingsworth, Leah's cheating boyfriend *Matthew Faber as Ben Gold *Rachel DeWoskin as Monica *Chen Jianbin as \\"Guanxi\\" *Fu Biao as Shen Gang, Lin Qingqing's suitor *Hu Xin as Xiaoming, Leah's coworker and friend *Elizabeth Sung as Richard's mother Production Co-produced by Celestial Pictures and Beijing Youth Film Studios, Restless was filmed in Beijing at a cost of $3 million. The dialog was shot primarily in English, with approximately 20% spoken in Chinese. Through the film's title and story, producer and co-writer Peter Shiao wanted to \\"capture something that's unique to [the college] generation ... the need to go on the road and explore yourself, in the process of exploring the world.\\" While the film highlights the cultural differences between America and China, Shiao notes that he was careful not to overly politicize the dialog, wanting to avoid both being seen as too critical of the Chinese government, and of being too politically correct. He wanted the film to \\"test the viability of the Chinese market\\". Being co-produced with a Chinese company and under a profit-sharing film, Shiao felt the work could be distributed in China without the restrictions placed on other American films. He also felt it would aid diplomacy between the two countries after changes in China's handling of intellectual properties. He notes, however, that Chinese authorities would first have to approve the film, which \\"push[es] the envelope\\". It took a year of negotiations over \\"script approvals, actor selections and crew\\" for the co- production to be approved, but Shiao felt it was important that the film be viewable to both Chinese and American audiences. Distribution Restless was first screened at the Hawaii International Film Festival in November 1998. Additional screenings followed at Shown at Cinema Seattle/Women in Cinema Film Festival, held from January 29‚ÄìFebruary 4, 1999, the Cleveland International Film Festival in March 1999, and at the New York Women's Film Festival on April 22, 1999. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States, premiering in Los Angeles on November 3, 2000. It was later aired in San Francisco starting on January 19, 2001, and in New York City on January 26, 2001. It was released on Region 1 DVD by Arrow Releasing on December 4, 2001. Reception By the end of its theatrical run on February 8, 2001, Restless had a gross earnings of $18,154 in the United States. It received generally negative reviews from American film critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 39 based on 10 reviews. Ken Eisner of Variety thought the performances and script were good, and that the film would appeal to Mandarin-speaking areas of the world. Laura Kelly of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel drew comparisons to Sex and the City, but called Restless \\"less smart and less overtly sexual\\". She also called the film clich√©d and noted that its parallel storylines expressed redundant themes. Dennis Lim of The Village Voice noted that Gilfillan relies on \\"rote culture-clash pratfalls\\" and fails to deliver on any of its promised storylines. Several critics noted the good use of Beijing scenery, and that Restless exposes some settings in Beijing that viewers might not otherwise see.

Arrighi became known for his preaching and evangelization efforts and acted as a reformer in establishing houses for the Franciscans in northern Italian cities and throughout the Corsica island where he was born. He was known for his cheerful demeanor and his willingness to assist others while also known for his tireless dedication to silence and solitude which he exhorted his fellow friars to exercise in order to better commune with God. He was beatified in 1896 and was canonized as a saint on 29 June 1930. Life Biagio Arrighi was born on 30 October 1676 in Corsica to the nobles Giovanni Antonio and Maddalena. He studied under the Franciscans and on 21 September 1693 joined their order and assumed his religious name. He loved silence and solitude and found it a better method of communication with the Lord while exhorting his fellow Franciscans to do the same to reflect on the goodness of God. He completed his theological studies in Rome with distinctions and began his theological studies in Naples. Arrighi made his solemn profession in Salerno in 1694 and was ordained to the priesthood in Naples at the convent of Santa Maria La Nova on 30 November 1700. Once he was ordained he begged his superiors for permission to repair an old convent at Civitella near Subiaco. He founded houses for the order in the Tuscan region and in Corscia in places such as Zuani and Fucecchio. He was a reformer who become known for his preaching and evangelization efforts and for his cheerful disposition. Arrighi first met Tommaso da Cori in 1702 in Bellegra and would live with him for the next decade until 1709 when he was stationed in Palombra until 1715. He served as the guardian of that convent from 1713 to 1715 before he would return to Bellegra. He was in Rome from 1734 until 1735 when he was moved to Bellegra once more. Arrighi died on 17 June 1740. Sainthood The cause for his canonization opened after his death in 1750 and Pope Benedict XIV named him as Venerable on 21 November 1755. The cause culminated on 19 January 1896 after Pope Leo XIII beatified him while Pope Pius XI later proclaimed him to be a saint on 29 June 1930.

Seashores and beaches provide varied habitats in different parts of the world, and even within the same beach. Phytoplankton is at the bottom of some food chains, while zooplankton and other organisms eat phytoplankton. Kelp is also autotrophic and at the bottom of many food chains. Coastal areas are stressed through rapid changes, for example due to tides. A marine iguana, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, on the beach at Tortuga Bay on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos British seashores The coasts round Britain and the sea nearby is of international significance. Animal life varies from large whales, dolphins and porpoises, grey seals and common seals, through to microscopic animals. There are more than 200 species of fish, ranging from small fish like blennies through to basking sharks that are the second largest shark in the world. Habitats include areas of landslips, beaches with sand, shingle and rock, cliffs, coastal lagoons, isolated sea stacks and islands, muddy estuaries, salt marshes, submaritime zones (i.e. land influenced by sea spray) and the sea itself. British coasts are affected by strong winds and in some areas large waves. British tidal ranges are large compared to some other parts of the world. Sheltered shores support different life from exposed shores. Non- flowering plants range from microscopic plants through to seaweed or kelp up to 5 meters in height. Many animals feed on kelp and kelp provides sheltered habitats for yet others. Sea grass is the only type of flowering plant that grows in British seas, but it nonetheless forms vast beds. Invertebrates in coastal Britain are very diverse and include brittle stars, hermit crabs, mussels, prawns, sponges, sea anemones and sea squirts. Efforts are made to conserve rare plants and animals in Nature reserves. Cliffs, islands and sea stacks are a habitat for breeding sea birds such as guillemots, kittiwakes and razor bills, as well as rock doves which can live inland as well. Peregrine falcons hunt the doves. Estuaries provide a habitat for waders and ducks, especially in winter. West African seashores The coastline of West Africa extends from Senegal to Gabon and like many other coastlines worldwide, it is characterized by a variety of ecosystems (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Common on this coast are sandy shores interspersed with rocky shores and several rivers, which empty into the Gulf of Guinea. Well-known rocky beaches on the West African coast include Cape Verde in Senegal, Cape Three Points in Ghana and Mount Cameroun. There are other smaller rocky beaches and between them are sandy beaches, which may be small, or extensive (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). On the coast of Ghana for instance, the greatest extent of almost continuous rock shore is on either side of Cape Three Points and stretches from the Ankobra River in the west to Sekondi in the east, a distance of about 45 miles. The west of the Ankobra is characterized by sandy beaches extending through Ivory Coast. Also, between Takoradi and Prampram, 150 miles to the east, sandy shores dominate but rocky shores of limited extent occur in several places, notably in the region of Cape Coast and Elmina and in the Accra area. At the east of Prampram, sandy beaches stretch almost continuously along the eastern coast of Ghana and throughout Nigeria until a rocky shore is met with again in the Cameroons (Gauld and Buchanan, 1959). Various surveys of the West African seashore have found barnacles and gastropods dominating the invertebrate community (Gauld and Buchanan, 1959; Yankson and Akpabey, 2001; Yankson and Kendall, 2001; Lamptey, Armah and Allotey, 2009). Three species of barnacles, namely Cthamalus dentatus, Megabalanus tintinnabulum and Tetraclita squamata are found on the West African rocky shores. C. dentatus is the common barnacle of open coasts. They have a kite shaped opening to the shell. Six plates are clearly visible in isolated individuals. The plates have projecting ribs giving the animal a star-shaped outline. Recently settled animals are a pale brown color but as they age, they quickly become dirty white. C. dentatus have no calcareous base between the body of the animal and the rock surface (Edmunds, 1978; Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Tetraclita squamata tends to be conical in shape and can reach a large size (25mm or more in length). Unlike Chthamalus species, it does not occur in vast sheets of interlocking animals. The plates making up the shell become fused as the animal grows and in large specimens can be difficult to distinguish. The plates are perforated by rows of fine holes. This species is often heavily overgrown by algae (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Megabalanus tintinnabulum is found worldwide and has been described on this site. The most common hermit crabs on this shore are Clibernarius chapini and Clibernarius senegalensis. Identification of species is complex but the common rule is C. chapini occurs mostly in long turreted gastropod shells while C. senegalensis in short, more rounded shells (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Three types of keyhole limpets, family Fissurellidae are encountered on the West African seashore. Diodora menkeana (Dunker) has an aperture length between 6‚Äì15 mm; height about half its length and a small apical hole markedly anterior. It has sculpture of intersecting radiating and concentric ridges, color may be cream, pale pink or brown. This species occurs throughout West Africa in shallow and low on rocky shores though rare (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). The genus Fissurella is distinguished from Diodora by its flatter shell, a larger more central apical hole, sculpture of only radiating ridges and height about a third of its length. Species of this genus are found low on the shore attached to rocks from which they scrape minute algae. They rest on open rock and do not seek crevices (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Two species has been recorded. Fissurella coarctata has a large apical hole and of characteristic shape, color pale pink or brown. It has a length of about 25‚Äì35 mm. This species is fairly common in Senegal and Sierra Leone, rare in Ghana and has not been recorded further east (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Fissurella nubecula has an aperture length of 15‚Äì25 mm, medium sized apical hole and color pink or violet often with radiating white bands. This species is common from Ghana eastwards and in Senegal though it seems to be rarer in between. It is commoner in sheltered rather than in exposed areas (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Siphonaria pectinata (Family: Siphonariidae, described on another page) has an aperture length of 20‚Äì30 mm long, slightly less wide, height about half its length or more, sculpture of fine radiating ridges, often worn smooth at apex. This species has a color that is externally dark brown or grey, paler at worn apex, internally shining black at edges, paler at center. It is common at all levels on the West African rocky shores and it rests on exposed shores (Edmunds, 1978). Patella safiana (see Cymbula safiana, family Patellidae) has an oval aperture height about 40‚Äì60 mm or more. It is sculptured by radiating ridges, colored grey externally, and blue-grey and white internally, with a horseshoe shaped paler scar, which is interrupted anteriorly to make room for the head. It is found throughout West Africa usually common on open rocks from low to mid shore or sometimes higher on exposed shores. It is often found in damp hollows, but does not particularly seek crevices. It feeds by scraping minute algae and grasping pieces of seaweeds. Each individual rests in the same place and wears a slight depression in the rock into which the shell fits exactly. It is hard to remove when attached to the rock with its foot (Edmunds, 1978). Nerita senegalensis (Family Neritiidae) has shell height and width almost the same length, 15‚Äì20 mm, with teeth occurring on the outer lip of aperture. It has a pleated collumella with irregular tubercles and very fine spiral ridges on shell. This species has a dark grey color with small paler markings and sometimes uniformly yellow color. This is one of the commonest gastropod species on West African rocky shores, occurring from low tide level to the upper shore. It usually rests in crevices when the tide is out, and may also be found on the open rock and in rocky pools. In Senegal, it extends into rocky estuaries (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Three species of the gastropod family Littorinidae are common on the West Africa shore. Littorina punctata has a shell height of about 8‚Äì15 mm, color brown or grey with white markings in spiral rows often giving a checked appearance. This species is usually common on all rocky West African shores, occurring from the middle to upper parts, though young specimen occur lower down and in rock pools (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Littorina cinguilifera has a shell height of about 8‚Äì12 mm, color alternating brown or grey and white bands, the darker bands sometimes interrupted with white dots especially near the top of the whorl. This species occurs from the middle to upper parts of rocky shores and extends into rocky estuaries. It is usually rarer than the previous species though common in Sierra Leone, it is rare in Senegal and probably Nigeria but extends to Cameroun (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Littorina angulifera (Littoraria angulifera) Thais species (Muricidae) have wide oval aperture, notched at base; columella callosity smooth and arched; operculum is horny thin, nucleus at outside edge; sculpture of rounded or pointed tubercles. This genus is distributed worldwide. The species found on the West Africa shore are Thais forbesi, Thais nodosa, Thais callifera and Thais haemostoma. Thais nodosa shell height is about 40‚Äì55 mm, width somewhat less; body whorl large, spire short and blunt; outer lip is spreading outwards; columella callosity broad, almost flat, white with usually two purple spots on it, sculpture of five spiral rows or rounded tubercles, the two upper ones being the most prominent; color pale fawn. This is a fairly common species low on rocky shores especially in crevices under overhanging rocks, etc (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Thais haemostoma (see Stramonita haemastoma described on this site). Thais forbesi shell height is about 25‚Äì35 mm, width somewhat less and aperture about half height of shell. It is not usually toothed; spire somewhat pointed; two or three spiral rows of pointed tubercles. This species is grey to brown in color, often overgrown; and inside of the aperture is grey(Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Thais callifera has a shell height of 30 ‚Äì 70 mm, with width slightly less, aperture notched near suture as well as below; body whorl large, spire short and blunt, sculpture two or four rows or rounded tubercles, color pale fawn, inside of aperture pale orange. This species has been recorded in Nigeria and Cameroun. Shells may sometimes be confused with Thais haemostoma, but are paler and fatter (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Rotula sp. (Echinodermata: West African sand dollar) have the appearance of flattened sea urchin. They are circular to heart shaped in outline and little more than the thickness of a coin in depth. A mat of flat lying spines covers them. Sand dollars bury into intertidal sand leaving a characteristic mark at the sediment surface. This species had been recorded in Ghana though rare (Yankson and Kendall, 2001). Other species found on the West Africa shore such as sea anemone, Perna perna, Ocypode cursor, Diadema antillarum have already been described on this site.

Nokia appointed an employee to create a service for the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP), because of the significant brand- and distribution presence that it already had in those markets at that time. In 2013 Nokia Life was eliminated due to Nokia‚Äôs switch in focus and the arise of Internet based information services in those markets. The service has been available in Pakistan, India, Indonesia, China, and Nigeria. Around 125 million people have experienced Nokia Life services in these five countries. Nokia Life was launched as Mera Nokia, in the state of Maharashtra in India in early 2009.The Register: Nokia Life Tools help Indian farmers get one After the successful pilot, a wider commercial deployment of the service under the name Nokia Life Tools began in India in June 2009.Nokia Life Tools ‚Äì Inform, Involve, Empower The service was later expanded to Indonesia in November 2009,Nokia Press: Nokia Life Tools Launches in Indonesia China in May 2010,Nokia Press: Nokia Life Tools Launched in China and Nigeria in November 2010.Nokia Press: Nokia Life Tools Launches in Nigeria Nokia Life was able to use the existing distribution network of Nokia by pre-installing it on Nokia devices. The first two supported devices were the Nokia 2323 Classic and Nokia 2330 Classic devices.https://www.mobilegazette.com/nokia-2323-2330-classic-08x11x04.htm  Customer-centric approach  Nokia Life was precursor of the customer-centric approach. Customer studies in the form of pilots, surveys, observation, and prototyping were used as input and testing for both the product design as the business model. Consequently, the trick was to scale the service to a personal content level to address multiple micro segments. Affordability is one of the most important challenges to overcome when targeting the Bottom of the Pyramid. The customer-centric approach contributed to achieving affordability by ensuring that Nokia Life invested time and money in activities and elements that were most relevant for the targeted customer segments. Therefore, Nokia Life operated on a local level with locally-insights driven teams. The service has been built from the ground-up based on the insights that local teams were gathering about each specific market in order to overcome the paradox of distance by adjusting the product or service to the local needs in order to increase the fit with the customer segment. The unit was headed by Jawahar Kanjilal, Global Head for Nokia Life.Forbes: Nokia‚Äôs Emerging Hope The languages were also adjusted to local preferences. For example, the services in India supported 11 local languages.PSFK: Nokia Life Tools (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Punjabi, Kannada, Malayalam, Assamese and Oriya).  Value Proposition  Basically, Nokia Life helped people to make decisions at one specific moment in time. Therefore, it had to make sure that it created value by providing the right content for that decision, and delivering the value at that specific moment in time. For example, the agricultural part of the service consists of localized information including weather conditions, advice about crop cycles, general tips and techniques, as well as market prices for crops. Farmers in the pilot scheme said getting daily prices on their phones reduced their dependency on agents for basic information, enabling them to negotiate with greater confidence. The relevance of the service is described in an anecdote from the former Strategic Manager: ‚ÄúOne of our customers was a farmer who had a son that drove all day around on his bicycle to visit markets and determine the market prices. At the end of the day, when the farmer was loading his crops, the son gave this information to his father so that he knew what price he could ask for his crop.‚Äù The proposition from Nokia Life was built around how it could improve people‚Äôs live and livelihoods. Furthermore, the educational tools provide simple English and general knowledge courses in local languages, as well as study modules in a variety of state and ICSE board topics, including history, geography, biology, physics and chemistry. In India, it also includes a service that allows students to retrieve their exam results through their NLT app. The healthcare services offers pregnancy and childcare advice, men‚Äôs health, and women‚Äôs health in all countries. There is also a range of health topics like respiratory, heart, diabetes, hepatitis and digestive health which are specific to some countries.Nokia Conversations: Healthcare Tips Start To Gain Traction Finally, the entertainment services suite offering varies regionally and includes among others cricket & football scores, news, wallpapers, astrology, and ringtones.  ‚ÄòA rupee a day kind of service‚Äô  People at the BoP find a cost of ownership structure that matches their disposable income more important than the total amount of money that has to be paid at the end of the cycle. Consequently, Nokia Life was aiming for ‚Äòa rupee a day kind of service‚Äô. The price differentiated per country, but was always between $0.50 and $1.00 per month. The former CEO explains the degree of affordability of Nokia Life: ‚ÄúOne rupee will not even get you a cigarette, so people should value the service more than a cigarette.‚Äù  Partnerships  Nokia Life included partners in their business model to complement each other in order to serve a common goal. It built a platform that could reach specific segments while other parties were also looking to reach this segment with certain content. Nokia Life‚Äôs need for content and the partner‚Äôs need for a platform were combined. In return those partners were willing to bear costs in the form of sponsorships and to provide free content and resources. Partnerships included some services that were free to the end consumer and paid for by the partner (advertiser). Here the partner paid for a sequential engagement with the Nokia Life user. This sequential engagement unit (SEU) was offered to partners to help drive behavioral and attitudinal changes. These SEU's helped build the context and reinforce the messaging by targeted communication with the users over a specified time duration.Medianama: Arogya Powers Diabetes Prevention mHealth Updates In India On Nokia Life Tools The most critical partnerships involved content providers for free content (e.g. governmental organizations, NGOs, universities, content agencies), and Nokia and operators as distribution partners. The service provider included at first partners that were used to get the content and offering in place, and secondly go-to-market partners (operators) were included.

Carney could not get his novel published until a chance meeting with film producer Euan Lloyd. Lloyd loved the story, about mercenaries in Africa on a mission to rescue a deposed leader, and purchased the rights to adapt it into a film. Carney in return asked for his novel to be published and Lloyd agreed, as he had already had an offer from an American publisher when he had first taken the novel to Hollywood. The novel was finally published as The Wild Geese just before the film's release. The storyMay 1968= Deposed Congolese President Julius Limbani is on a flight to Israel, when his bodyguard is murdered. The CIA have hijacked the plane as part of a Cold War deal with current Congo president General Ndofa. Waiting in the Tel Aviv airport for Limbani is an Anglo-South African mercenary soldier Colonel Allen Faulkner. Faulkner is under contract to take Limbani back to the Congo and mount a coup d'√©tat. When Limbani fails to arrive, Faulkner is left unemployed and returns to South Africa. =November 1970= Over two years have passed and Faulkner is summoned to London by merchant banker Sir Edward Matherson. Faulkner learns that not only is Limbani alive but he is held in Algeria and is to be returned to the Congo for execution. Matherson proposes for Faulkner to raise and lead a mercenary unit to rescue Limbani and bring him to London. With this chance to redeem his tarnished reputation after Limbani was kidnapped under his contracted safety, Faulkner agrees and sets about assembling his team. Three men are top of Faulkner's list; all have served under him in the past and are trusted beyond question. First to be recruited is American Rafer Janders, who at that time is in hiding from the Mafia. They've put out a contract on Janders' life after he killed a local godfather's nephew after tricking Janders into being a courier of heroin. As Matherson persuades the Mafia into lifting the contract, Faulkner finds Janders holed up above a night club for homosexuals. Whilst waiting for Matherson to deal with the Mafia, Faulkner learns about what has happened to Janders since they last served together 7 years ago. With Janders now part of the operation Faulkner turns to two more comrades from the Congo, Lieutenant Jeremy Chandos and Regimental Sergeant Major Sandy Young. After recruiting two more officers (Fynn and Coetzee) and 45 NCOs and enlisted men, the group travels to Portuguese-ruled Mozambique for training. Once Young begins training, he quickly becomes resented by most of the men because of his rigid and harsh methods. While Faulkner remains popular with the men, it is not the same for the RSM, who easily defeats an attempt by a few disgruntled mercenaries to kill him. Now respected as well as disliked by the men, RSM Young transforms old, seasoned soldiers and young rookies into a formidable fighting force. As Faulkner and Janders procure their transport and weapons, Chandos, Fynn and Coetzee explore the local nightlife of Louren√ßo Marques. There Fynn and Chandos meet two local escort girls; Jeremy dates Maria. Shawn dates Gabriella, who is nicknamed Gabby, and finds himself once again with a reason not to go on the mission. Fynn eventually recognises that he has a responsibility to his comrades and flies out with the rest of the mercenaries. However Fynn makes a promise to Gabby that he will return to her when he gets back. A C-130 belonging to Mad Malloy takes them to their drop zone in the hills surrounding Albertville. The jump goes well except for Fynn, whose parachute fails to deploy properly but manages to land safely after using his reserve chute. Faulkner gathers his men, then the group splits in two and each march on their respective objective. As Chandos and Fynn's group approach the local Airport, Faulkner's group manage to find the army barracks after an unexpected delay. The barracks which hold a garrison of the Congolese national army (ANC) as well as the imprisoned Limbani, cannot be approached easily, as there is no cover for a hundred metres. To take out the three sentries, Coetzee shoots them with crossbow armed with cyanide-tipped bolts. The mercenaries enter the barracks quickly and quietly as most of the garrison is asleep; it is now they split into three further groups. As Young leads one team to destroy the armoury, Janders' group enters the dormitories and, wearing gas masks, proceeds to kill the sleeping soldiers with cyanide gas. While these two groups get on with their tasks, Faulkner's group burst in on the guard-house under cover of the mercenaries' guns. Coetzee relieves one of the Congolese Officers of the keys to the cells located beneath the room and along with a Scottish mercenary (McTaggart) Coetzee storms the basement, and after a short firefight they free Limbani. With their mission complete, Faulkner's group leaves the barracks for the airport in captured ANC trucks. After being told over the radio that Faulkner had been successful, Chandos' team attacks the main building while Fynn's team take over the control tower. With the airport under the control of the mercenaries they await the arrival of Faulkner's group, but unfortunately, the perimeter guards start to come under attack from Ndofa's Simbas. As they hold off the Simbas and await Faulkner, Fynn uses the control tower's radio to talk the waiting transport plane down onto the runway. The plane lands just as the Simbas break through the perimeter at the opposite end of the runway and start shooting at the plane. At this time Faulkner's group arrives, but the plane's pilot under strict instructions from Mad Malloy refuses to wait for the mercenaries and promptly takes off. Leaving the mercenaries stranded, Faulkner organises a fighting withdrawal, taking with them all the fuel, spare arms and ammunition they can pile on the trucks and jeeps. The mercenaries ambush the following Simbas and are still in good order, only a few men getting killed. As they make their way south, heading for Limbani's home tribal land, they approach an old rickety wooden bridge. Only the first few vehicles make it across, as the bridge collapses under the weight of a fuel tanker, leaving the last jeep stranded on the northern river bank. In that jeep is Limbani, Coetzee, McTaggart and medical orderly Whity. As Faulkner's party reach the village of Limbani's people and find a sort of sanctuary there, Coetzee's party is ambushed by the Simbas. Whity is killed. McTaggart is missing; it is later revealed that he had suicidally charged the Simbas with a grenade in each hand after deliberately drawing them away from Coetzee and Limbani, and Coetzee was also killed while trying to save Limbani. RSM Young, sent by Faulkner, arrives just in time to save Limbani and bring him to the village. Ndofa contacts Faulkner over the telephone in the local police station, which the mercenaries have taken over and are using as their headquarters. With the risk of Limbani's return starting a civil war Ndofa and Faulkner make a deal to exchange Limbani for one million dollars. Janders disagrees and, holding Faulkner at gunpoint, forces a vote amongst the mercenary officers. When RSM Young votes to follow Faulkner, Janders, Fynn and Chandos vote against Faulkner's plan, as they feel they still owe it to Limbani and the original contract. When the local missionary priest reveals to the mercenaries that there is a Dakota on an airstrip nearby, they decide to use it to escape, with Fynn to pilot it all the way to Rhodesia. The taking over of the lone Dakota on the all-but-deserted airstrip goes well, but as the bulk of the mercenaries retreat towards the plane they come under heavy attack from the pursuing Simbas. When Faulkner is gravely wounded, unable to carry Faulkner to the plane, the RSM decides to stay with him. Fynn starts up the Dakota's engines and taxis onto the runway as Janders, along with Mercenaries Hammond, Rubens, Ferguson, McFarlane, and Williams, provide cover while the mercenaries get on board. At the last second as the plane begins to start its take off, they rush for the plane, both Rubens and Williams are dead, with Ferguson's fate unknown, Hammond is killed while running on the runway, under the gunfire from the Simbas. Only Janders and McFarlane have survived the battle although Janders helps McFarlane who has been wounded; he is safely brought aboard into the Dakota with the help of Chandos, but in doing so Janders misses his own chance to climb onto the accelerating aircraft. With the distance between the plane and Janders growing, he pleads to be killed and not left to the savage Simbas, which Chandos regretfully does with a burst from his rifle. The Dakota suddenly slows down on the runway and u-turns heading back the way it came, because Fynn is shot in the spine. The wounded Fynn manages to get the Dakota off the ground whilst aided by Chandos and Sgt Benson (the last of the NCOs) and flies the Dakota all the way to Rhodesia.

In other words, individuals in institutions may be deprived (whether unintentionally or not) of independence and of responsibility, to the point that once they return to \\"outside life\\" they are often unable to manage many of its demands;Solving Mental Health Problems (2001) it has also been argued that institutionalized individuals become psychologically more prone to mental health problems. The term institutionalization can also be used to describe the process of committing an individual to a mental hospital or prison or to institutional syndrome; thus the phrase \\"X is institutionalized\\" may mean either that X has been placed in an institution, or that X is suffering the psychological effects of having been in an institution for an extended period of time. Background In Europe and North America, the trend of putting the mentally ill into mental hospitals began as early as the 17th century, and hospitals often focused more on \\"restraining\\" or controlling inmates than on curing them, although hospital conditions improved somewhat with movements for human treatment, such as moral management. By the mid-20th century, overcrowding in institutions, the failure of institutional treatment to cure most mental illnesses, and the advent of drugs such as Thorazine prompted many hospitals to begin discharging patients in large numbers, in the beginning of the deinstitutionalization movement (the process of gradually moving people from inpatient care in mental hospitals, to outpatient care). Deinstitutionalization did not always result in better treatment, however, and in many ways it helped reveal some of the shortcomings of institutional care, as discharged patients were often unable to take care of themselves, and many ended up homeless or in jail. In other words, many of these patients had become \\"institutionalized\\" and were unable to adjust to independent living. One of the first studies to address the issue of institutionalization directly was Russell Barton's 1959 book Institutional Neurosis, which claimed that many symptoms of mental illness (specifically, psychosis) were not physical brain defects as once thought, but were consequences of institutions' \\"stripping\\" (a term probably first used in this context by Erving Goffman) away the \\"psychological crutches\\" of their patients. Since the middle of the 20th century, the problem of institutionalization has been one of the motivating factors for the increasing popularity of deinstitutionalization and the growth of community mental health services, since some mental healthcare providers believe that institutional care may create as many problems as it solves. Romanian children who suffered from severe neglect at a young age were adopted by families. Research reveals that the post-institutional syndrome occurring in these children gave rise to symptoms of autistic behavior.

Issues for discharged patients Individuals who suffer from institutional syndrome can face several kinds of difficulties upon returning to the community. The lack of independence and responsibility for patients within institutions, along with the 'depressing' and 'dehumanizing' environment, can make it difficult for patients to live and work independently. Furthermore, the experience of being in an institution may often have exacerbated individuals' illness: proponents of labeling theory claim that individuals who are socially \\"labeled\\" as mentally ill suffer stigmatization and alienation that lead to psychological damage and a lessening of self-esteem, and thus that being placed in a mental health institution can actually cause individuals to become more mentally ill.

The OBSI provides the service on an impartial and independent basis, and free of charge to the consumer as an alternative to the legal system. How it works OBSI is Canada's national independent dispute resolution service (ADR) for consumers or small businesses with a complaint they can't resolve with their financial services firm. As a free alternative to the legal system, OBSI works informally and confidentially to find fair outcomes to disputes about banking and investment products and services. If OBSI decides that a firm has acted unfairly, made an error or given a customer bad advice, and the customer lost money as a result, it will recommend that the firm restore your financial position to where it should have been. OBSI may also recommend other types of non-financial compensation when appropriate. If OBSI thinks a customer has been treated fairly, or the settlement offer the customer has previously received from a firm is fair, OBSI will inform the customer and let them know the reasons why it believes so. While OBSI cannot order a firm to follow a recommendation, OBSI has an excellent record of firms ‚Äì and clients ‚Äì accepting its recommendations. OBSI will make public the name of any firm that refuses a recommendation. The limit for OBSI's recommendations is $350,000. However, if a customer's claim is for an amount higher than $350,000 the customer can voluntarily reduce it. OBSI is not a regulator, and because OBSI is impartial it does not advocate for consumers or the industry. That also means OBSI doesn't give advice ‚Äì financial, legal or other. If a customer doesn't like OBSI's findings in a case, the customer is still able to go to a lawyer or seek other ways of resolving the dispute. History OBSI was founded in 1996 as the Canadian Banking Ombudsman to review complaints by small business against the chartered banks. In a few short months the mandate was expanded to cover unresolved consumer complaints as well. In 2002, as a result of discussions among government, industry and consumer groups about improving consumer protection in financial services, all members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada joined the organization. At the same time OBSI invited credit unions to join and changed its name to \\"Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments\\" (OBSI). In 2013, the Canadian Securities Administrators announced amendments to National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations (NI 31-103) and Companion Policy 31-103CP Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations that will require all registered dealers and advisers outside of Quebec to use OBSI as their provider of dispute-resolution services. By August 1, 2014, all registered dealers must be members in OBSI, with the effect that OBSI's membership will more than double, to over 1600 participating firms. Any regulated firm in the banking services and investment fields is eligible to join OBSI. In September 2018, Scotiabank stopped using OBSI, making the third big bank, after Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada to not use OBSI. Complaints that OBSI deals with OBSI looks into complaints about most banking and investment matters including: > * mutual funds * bonds and GICs * stocks, exchange-traded funds, income > trusts and other securities * investment advice * unauthorized trading * > fraud * mortgages * loans and credit * debit and credit cards * fees and > rates * transaction errors * misrepresentation; * accounts sent to > collections OBSI is able to make recommendations for amounts up to $350,000. OBSI currently has more than 600 participating firms in Canada, including: > * Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) member firms > * Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA) member firms * Mutual > fund companies * Exempt market dealers * Portfolio managers * Scholarship > plan dealers * Forex trading services * Banks * Credit unions * Federal > trust and loan companies and other deposit-taking organizations A full list of firms that participate in OBSI can be found at www.obsi.ca here. Complaints that OBSI won't deal with If the customer's complaint involves an insurance company, the customer should contact one of the insurance ombudservices to see if they can help. The OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance (OLHI) deals with concerns about life and health insurance, including disability, while the General Insurance Ombudservice (GIO) covers issues of car, property and business insurance. Along with OBSI, the insurance services are part of the Financial Services OmbudsNetwork, a network of dispute resolution services working to resolve complaints fairly and impartially. OBSI won't take on a complaint if: > * The customer or the firm has started a court action or arbitration process > * The firm responded to customer‚Äôs complaint, and the customer did not bring > it to OBSI on a timely basis * The customer has already settled the > complaint by accepting an offer from the firm * It‚Äôs about a general > commercial decision of the firm, such as an interest rate or a credit > decision Governance  OBSI's governance structure is designed to ensure the Ombudsman and staff are independent and impartial, and have the necessary resources to carry out their jobs. A non-profit and independent organization, OBSI is overseen by a Board of Directors. A majority of the directors are independent, and have not been part of industry or government for at least five years. A minority of the directors are appointed from lists of nominees provided by industry bodies. The directors also comprise the voting membership of the organization. OBSI is headed by the Ombudsman has two teams of investigators: one for Banking Services and the other for Investments. The Ombudsman is also independent of industry and government. Funding  OBSI levies fees on all of participating firms based on their size or volume of business. OBSI's budget is set each year by the Board of Directors based on the advice of staff. International Network of Financial Services Ombudsman Schemes OBSI is a member of the International Network of Financial Services Ombudsman Schemes, a global association whose members operate as out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms in the financial sector. Other members include: > * Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia) * Financial Services Ombudsman's > Bureau of Ireland * Ombudsman for Banking Services (South Africa) * > Financial Ombudsman Service (United Kingdom) A list of all members can be found at the International Network's website.

Wola Ostrowiecka no longer exists. It was burned to the ground during the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. The perpetrators were nationalists of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's territorial command Piwnicz, aided by local Ukrainian peasants. On 30 August 1943, the Ukrainians surrounded the village, and began murdering the Polish inhabitants. Altogether, 79 families were murdered in their entirety, and in another 37 families, only one family member survived.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn, page 81. McFarland, 2008; .

Account of the massacre According to the Polish survivors, the perpetrators had been preparing the attack for a few days in advance. The Poles noticed that their Ukrainian neighbors were drinking heavily, and chanting anti-Polish slogans.Genocide of Poles in Kresy; Wola Ostrowiecka i Ostr√≥wki (31 August 1943), web.archive.orgl accessed 6 September 2014. On the morning of 29 August, the Ukrainians surrounded the village. At first, they acted in a friendly way, talking to children, and asking men to gather in a square in front of the school. A Ukrainian Insurgent Army officer made a speech, in which he urged Poles to fight the Germans, alongside the Ukrainians. At the same time, on the outskirts of the village, pits for dead bodies had already been dug. After the speech, all Polish men were asked to come for ‚Äúphysical examination‚Äù in a barn, one by one; they were killed by blows to the head with a blunt object. The mass grave discovered during the second exhumation in Wola Ostrowiecka (in August 2011 by Polish anthropologist Dr Leon Popek) Krzysztof Ogiolda with Dr Popek, \\"Ostr√≥wki: Zbrodnia i pojednanie\\", Nowa Trybuna Opolska, NTO.pl, 26 November 2011; retrieved 19 June 2013. Once all the men had been killed, the women and children were locked in the school building. One of the survivors, a young girl named Marianna Soroka, later recounted that they began singing hymns, and their mother told them to prepare for death. Another survivor, Henryk Kloc, who was 13, stated that the Ukrainians set fire to the school, and then began firing at it and throwing grenades inside. Kloc, heavily wounded, lay among the dying in a school orchard, and watched the murderers kill the five-year-old son of Maria Jesionek. The boy's mother had already been killed, and her son was sitting next to her, asking her to go home. ‚ÄúSuddenly an armed Ukrainian came to him, and shot the boy in the head‚Äù. Kloc himself only survived because he played dead. As soon as the massacre ended, local Ukrainian peasants began looting the village. After the massacre, the commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's unit reported: ‚ÄúOn August 29, I carried out the action in villages of Wola Ostrowiecka and Ostr√≥wki. I liquidated all Poles, from the youngest to the oldest ones. I burnt all buildings, and appropriated all goods.‚ÄùW≈Çadys≈Çaw Filar, Wolyn 1939‚Äì1944, Toru≈Ñ (2003), pp. 99‚Äì100; Archaeological studies Exhumation in progress Between 17‚Äì22 August 1992, Polish scientists carried out exhumation in the area where the village once stood. During the exhumation, it was established that in most cases, the murderers used of the head of an axe or a bludgeon. Wola Ostrowiecka no longer exists. Local Ukrainians call the village the Field of Dead Bodies. Every year, Polish survivors and their families organise a pilgrimage. In 2003, the village was going to be the center of celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia.

Kaiser loves corn liquor and cashmere wool. * Ben Lawson as Liam Priory, a first-year associate from Australia who is \\"too-cool\\" and possesses an uncircumcised penis. Priory has a self-described \\"impulse-control problem\\" when it comes to dealing with women, as he has sex with almost every woman in the law firm, except Adelaide \\"Addy\\" Fisher. Priory made his appearance in the first episode with his pants down to his ankles. * Tina Majorino as Adelaide \\"Addy\\" Fisher, a meek and insecure first-year associate. Fisher comes from a large family in the Midwest. She graduated top in her class at Case Western Reserve University and has \\"great legal instincts and a natural 'flair' for the law\\". She likes to bake. Hemingson created the character of Fisher as a CWRU alumna because one of the most intelligent people he knows attended that school. * Clancy Brown as Hart Sterling, the firm's managing partner; Sterling inherited the title through his family. Sterling believes that the law is a calling that can be used to enhance society and the world; he also believes the firm should do good, including pro bono work. Billy Zane plays Cliff Huddle, also known as the \\"Prince of Darkness\\". * Billy Zane as Clifford \\"Cliff\\" Huddle, the firm's other managing partner. Known as the \\"Prince of Darkness\\", Huddle is \\"cold\\" and \\"ruthless\\", and is considered the villain of the show. Although he is married to Susan Oppenheim, the firm's litigation partner, he has an affair with the firm's paralegal. Brimming with contempt, he thinks law is a way to make money, and does not care about the broader consequences. Huddle asserts that the firm should be run \\"as a business, not as a soup kitchen\\". He also frequently clashes with Sterling due to their diametrically opposed convictions about the law. * Mehcad Brooks as Malcolm Bennet, an outsider and first-year associate. Regarding the show and the topics it covers, Brooks says, \\"It definitely plucks at your heartstrings. But its quick-witted, glib, slightly arrogant, and very inspirational. It's some of the funniest stuff I ever read in my whole life‚àí.\\" * Leah Pipes as Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Branford, a wealthy, blond, first-year associate. Although she seems self-assured, she is secretly vulnerable and thinks money can buy a career. * Nicole Ari Parker as Susan Oppenheim, the firm's head litigation partner and the wife of Clifford \\"Cliff\\" Huddle. Together, Oppenheim and Huddle are antagonists against Sterling. Oppenheim chooses to go to jail rather than miss a motion‚Äìfiling dateline. = Recurring = * Rachelle Lefevre as Katie Campbell * David Giuntoli as Jason Carpenter  Production  The Deep End was created by David Hemingson, co-executive producer of How I Met Your Mother. Before he became a writer and a producer, Hemingson was formerly an associate in a law firm. The Deep End is based on Hemingson's early work experience as an attorney. Due to the cost of filming on location in Los Angeles where the story takes place, the show was filmed on a soundstage in the planned community of Las Colinas in Irving, Texas. Despite the change in location, references to local Los Angeles landmarks were still made on the show. 20th Century Fox Television produced the show for ABC. The show was described as L.A. Law meets Grey's Anatomy. Hemingson said the show contains \\"the back-stabbing of The Devil Wears Prada and the sun-drenched bed-hopping of Entourage\\". Texas Film Commission head Bob Hudgins estimated production costs at about $20 million. ABC scheduled six episodes of The Deep End for Thursday nights. ABC canceled the show in May 2010. Episodes Reception  Ratings = The show premiered on January 21, 2010 as a 2009‚Äì2010 midseason replacement for FlashForward, attracting 7 million viewers and receiving a low 1.7 rating in the category of Adults 18-49. = Critical response = The series received a negative critical response, averaging 40/100 on Metacritic, based on 23 reviews with one positive, 14 mixed, and eight negatives. Critics said that the show lacked originality and appeared similar to shows like L.A. Law, The Practice, Boston Legal, Damages, Eli Stone and The Good Wife. The show premiered in the time slot before Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice, leading the Washington Post to say that The Deep End resembled the two other shows \\"closely enough to warrant a paternity test\\". Toni Fitzgerald of Media Life Magazine said that even though The Deep End received a great deal of publicity, the show \\"sank in its first outing\\". Tom Maurstad of the Dallas Morning News observed that it was noticeable that the show was shot in Las Colinas, not in its setting of Los Angeles. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the show consisted of a \\"bunch of attractive people in suits saying the same lines\\". Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald described the show as \\"a dreadful attempt to duplicate Grey's Anatomy in a law office\\". Mark Peikert of the New York Press said that the show was \\"sailing in shallow waters\\". = Criticism = Attorneys criticized the show as unrealistic due to numerous violations of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct by the fictional attorneys on the show. The show was also criticized for its depiction of young associates performing tedious legal research with hard copy books in a law library; a firm the size and caliber of Sterling, Huddle, Oppenheim, & Craft would have a subscription to online databases like Westlaw or LexisNexis.

It is now a museum. History The barracks, which were named after Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, were completed in 1810 and first occupied by the British Army in 1814. Many Irishmen were stationed there before going overseas to fight in the First World War. During the First World War the barracks also served as the 2nd cavalry depot providing accommodation for the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, the 11th Hussars and the 13th Hussars. Deputy Michael Conaghan of the Inchicore Kilmainham Heritage Group has said, \\"The remaining buildings of Richmond Barracks here have very specific connections to the Easter Rising and its immediate aftermath. After the surrender, it was designated by the British as the holding centre for over 3,000 suspected rebels, until they were released or sent to prison camps in England, Wales and Northern Ireland... The signatories of the Proclamation (with the exception of James Connolly) and other leaders were also interned, court-martialed and sentenced to death in the barracks before they were sent to Kilmainham Gaol for execution.\\" The Prime Minister H. H. Asquith visited on 12 May 1916, after which no further executions of prisoners took place. After the Irish Free State was founded in 1922, the Barracks was occupied by the Irish Army, and briefly named Keogh Barracks, after Commander Tom Keogh who fought in the war of independence. The Irish government closed Keogh Barracks down in 1922. The building came into possession of the Dublin Corporation and was used to house Dublin families who were on the housing list; they built Keogh Square, which was demolished in 1970, and this was replaced by St. Michaels Estate there. At the same time as the transfer of the barracks to the corporation, Christian Brothers purchased three of the buildings and turned two of them into class rooms and called it \\"St Michaels Christian Brothers School\\", a national school opening in 1929. President Mary Robinson visited the school in October 1996. It closed down in 2006. Museum In May 2016, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Easter Rising, Richmond Barracks reopened as a museum, incorporating nearby Goldenbridge Cemetery.

The Games are divided into Summer and Winter Games. The Summer Games include 25 sports and are usually held in late July. The Winter Games include three different sports and are usually held in late January or early February. The Bay State Games is a member of the National Congress of State Games. Kevin Cummings currently serves as executive director.  Overview  The Massachusetts Amateur Sports Foundation (MASF), organizer of the Bay State Summer and Winter Games, provides Olympic-style athletic competitions and developmental programs for Massachusetts amateur athletes of all ages and abilities. The MASF operates statewide and year-round to promote personal development, education, physical fitness, teamwork, sportsmanship, and mutual respect. The MASF is a member of the National Congress of State Games, which comprises 35 states nationwide that conduct State Games events. In 2019, the Bay State Summer Games celebrated its 38th anniversary. In 2020, the Bay State Winter Games enjoyed its 35th year. From a modest beginning of four sports and 300 athletes, the Games have grown to include almost 6,000 athletes in 35 different sports from more than 300 Massachusetts cities and towns. Each sport is organized according to national governing body rules. Age and skill divisions have been created to allow medal opportunities for a broad range of athletes. The Bay State Games is one of the largest amateur multi-sports organizations in the state of Massachusetts. This non-profit organization is a member of the National Congress of State Games, associated with the United States Olympic Committee and its Affiliated Organization Council. The Bay State Games‚Äô mission is to promote personal development, education, health, physical fitness, teamwork and sportsmanship through recreational and educational programs. Over 6,000 Massachusetts residents ranging in age from 6 to 86 participate in these programs each year. Each year, the Bay State Games has over 1,000 volunteer including coaches, referees, and medical staff.  History  The Bay State Games was founded by Dave McGillvary in 1982. McGillvary was on the Governor‚Äôs Council of Physical Fitness and Sports. He wanted to create a statewide summer sports festival for Massachusetts. McGillvary appointed Doug Arnot to pitch the idea of ‚ÄúSportsfest‚Äù to the commonwealth of Massachusetts and to become the executive director (1982-1992). ‚ÄúSportsfest‚Äù started off with only four sports with 500 athletes. Peter Thomsen (1992-1996), Charlie Noonan (1996-1998), Linda Driscoll (1998-1999), and Kevin Cummings (1999-present) have all served as executive director. The Games‚Äô breakthrough year came in 1985. Basketball became the Game‚Äôs showcase event in both women's and men‚Äôs divisions. That same year, Arnot developed the idea of creating a winter sports festival for Massachusetts athletes. The Winter Games took place in the Northern Berkshire region because of the facilities available to them. Four hundred athletes took part in the 1985 Winter Games with competitions including figure skating, alpine skiing, cross country skiing and speed skating. Figure skating is the only sport to be included in every Winter Games. Masters ice hockey, youth ice hockey, speed skating, ski orienteering, snowboarding, sled dog racing, and cross country skiing were added into the competitions as the Winter Games became more successful.  Winter Games  The Winter Games are usually held in the months of January, February, and March in the Northern Berkshire region of Massachusetts. Featured sports include figure skating, curling, masters ice hockey, and futsal. Each year, the Winter Games have featured the Bay State Skate Figure Skating Show. This show was created in the 1980s to display some of the best skaters in the Winter Games. The Bay State Skate has more than a dozen Olympic skaters from the National and World Championships. Shows presented by the Bay State Games have included Olympians Nancy Kerrigan, Paul Wylie, Surya Bonaly, Linda Frattiani, Sylvia Fontana, and National competitors Mark Mitchell and Jennifer Kirk. The athletes in the Winter Games represent over 200 Massachusetts communities and participants range from ages 5 to 62. Events (as of 2020) *Curling *Figure Skating *Futsal *Ice hockey  Summer Games  The Summer Games is Massachusetts' own Olympic-style athletic competition that has been held since 1982 and features more than 6,000 athletes in 30 sports. Athletes represent over 300 Massachusetts communities, and participants range in age from 5 to 86. The Bay States Games reached it popularity in the 1990s when the number of participants increased to over 10,000 athletes. Over the years, the Bay State Games has expanded and focused more on individual sports such as swimming and track and field. Also, rugby has been one of the Games‚Äô fastest growing sports. Master divisions were created and recreational sports such as baton twirling, judo, table tennis, and badminton. The Summer Games span is six to seven weeks in June and July. Tryouts for the Summer Games are held throughout the month of June, with finals taking place in the Metro-Boston and central Massachusetts area in mid- July.

It is home to SCILT, Scotland's National Centre for Languages and the Confucius Institute for Scotland's Schools (CISS), both centres within the University of Strathclyde. The building is owned by the University, which bought the church in 1983 and used it as a theatre and performance space from 1992 until 2011. The former church building sits within the Ramshorn Cemetery, one of Glasgow's oldest burial grounds.  Architectural significance  The Ramshorn was originally built as St David's Parish Church in 1824, replacing a church that had stood on the site since 1720. Now a category A listed building, it was designed by English architect Thomas Rickman in the Gothic Revival style. This was the only Scottish church he designed. Many of the stained-glass windows in the building are the work of W and J J Kier of Glasgow. They depict stories from the Old and New Testament.  Historical significance  Known popularly as the Ramshorn Kirk, the church was in a wealthy and sought after area of Glasgow at the time. As such you will find many prominent Glaswegians buried in the surrounding Ramshorn Cemetery, including industrialist David Dale, and tobacco merchants Andrew Buchanan and John Glassford. Pierre Emile L'Angelier is also buried in the graveyard. He is the victim in the 1857 Madeleine Smith murder case. The exterior of the building features a plaque to Sir John A MacDonald, the first prime minister of Canada, who was born in the parish. You will also find plaques to Professor John Anderson, natural philosopher and founder of the institution that would become the University of Strathclyde, and his grandfather John Anderson, who was minister at the Ramshorn Church.  Current use  The University of Strathclyde bought the church in 1983 and commissioned Page/Park Architects to convert it into a theatre and performing arts space. It operated as a theatre and performance space from 1992 to 2011. In May 2018, plans were submitted by the University of Strathclyde to Glasgow City Council to renovate the former theatre into offices and an exhibition area. The Ramshorn reopened in September 2019 as the home of SCILT, Scotland's National Centre for Languages and the Confucius Institute for Scotland's Schools (CISS), based within the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Strathclyde.

The Norwegian Crusade marks the first time a European king personally went to the Holy Land.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Sigurd I Magnusson The journey to JerusalemFrom Norway to England (1107-08)= Sigurd and his men sailed from Norway in the autumn of 1107 with sixty ships and perhaps around 5,000 men. In the autumn he arrived in England, where Henry I was king. Sigurd and his men stayed there the entire winter, until the spring of 1108, when they again set sail westwards. =In mainland Iberia (1108‚Äì09)= After several months they came to the town of Santiago de Compostela (Jakobsland)Gary B. Doxey (1996), \\"Norwegian Crusaders and the Balearic Islands\\" , Scandinavian Studies, 10‚Äì1. in Galicia (Galizuland) where they were allowed by a local lord to stay for the winter. However, when the winter came there was a shortage of food, which caused the lord to refuse to sell food and goods to the Norwegians. Sigurd then gathered his army, attacked the lord's castle and looted what they could there. The identity of the local lord or count is uncertain.. In the spring they continued along the coast of Portugal, capturing eight Saracen galleys on their way, and then conquered a castle at Sintra (probably referring to Colares, which is closer to the sea), after which they continued to Lisbon, a \\"half Christian and half heathen\\" city, said to be on the dividing line between Christian and Muslim Iberia, where they won another battle. On their continued journey they sacked the town of Alkasse (probably Alc√°cer do Sal), and then, on their way into the Mediterranean, near the Strait of Gibraltar (Norfasund), met and defeated a Muslim squadron. =In the Balearics (1109)= After entering the Mediterranean (Griklands hafi) they sailed along the coast of the land of the Saracens (Serkland) to the Balearic Islands. The Balearics were at the time perceived by Christians to be nothing more than a pirate haven and slaving centre. The Norwegian raids are also the first recorded Christian attacks on the Islamic Balearic Islands (though smaller attacks certainly had occurred). The first place they arrived at was Formentera, where they encountered a great number of Bl√•menn (Blue or black men) and Serkir (Saracens) who had taken up their dwelling in a cave. The course of the fight is the most detailed of the entire crusade through written sources, and might possibly be the most notable historic event in the small island's history. After this battle, the Norwegians supposedly acquired the greatest treasures they had ever acquired. They then went on to successfully attack Ibiza and then Menorca. The Norwegians seem to have avoided attacking the largest of the Balearic Islands, Majorca, most likely because it was at the time the most prosperous and well-fortified centre of an independent taifa kingdom. Tales of their success may have inspired the Catalan‚ÄìPisan conquest of the Balearics in 1113‚Äì1115. =In Sicily (1109-10)= In the Spring of 1109, they arrived at Sicily (Sikileyjar), where they were welcomed by the ruling Count Roger II, who was only 12‚Äì13 years old at the time. =Kingdom of Jerusalem (1110)= Gerhard Munthe (1899). In the summer of 1110, they finally arrived at the port of Acre (Akrsborg) (or perhaps in Jaffa), and went to Jerusalem (Jorsala), where they met the ruling crusader king Baldwin I. They were warmly welcomed, and Baldwin rode together with Sigurd to the river Jordan, and back again to Jerusalem. The Norwegians were given many treasures and relics, including a splinter off the True Cross that Jesus had allegedly been crucified on. This was given on the condition that they would continue to promote Christianity and bring the relic to the burial site of St Olaf. Siege of Sidon (1110) Later, Sigurd returned to his ships at Acre, and when Baldwin was going to the Muslim town of Sidon (S√¶tt) in Syria (S√Ωrland), Sigurd and his men accompanied him in the siege. A siege that resulted in the town being taken and Lordship of Sidon being created. The journey back to Norway After this, Sigurd and his men sailed to Constantinople (), where Sigurd left all of his ships and valuable figureheads, and many of his men, and then made his way back to Norway by land, arriving there in 1111.

The building was originally located on the northeast corner of West Broadway Avenue and Main Street, but was moved by the town in 1999 to its present site across Broadway Avenue. The building consists of two wood frame sections; a 1¬Ω story section to the south comprising the baggage room, and a two-story section to the north containing the passenger waiting room, agent's office and agent's quarters. Both portions are extensively detailed with finials, braces, brackets and flat board trim. The depot was built to the Central Pacific Railroad's \\"Combination Depot #2\\" design, the only example of its type in Nevada, but one of six built on the Central Pacific system. None of the other five examples is known to have survived. The station was a regular stop for transcontinental train traffic, and was expanded in 1917. The station operated until the early 1990s, when it was closed. When what was now the Union Pacific Railroad announced plans to tear the depot down in 1998 the City of Lovelock expressed interest in the building. The same year the railroad signed over the building and a $42,500 donation, the projected cost of demolition. The town moved it from railroad property, completing a restoration in 2000, with help from prison labor. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The depot is leased to private retail businesses.

It is endemic to the High Sierra Nevada of California, where it is known from only about 20 occurrences. It grows in wet mountain habitat such as meadows, often in the presence of mosses and willows, between 2000 and 2700 meters in elevation.Taylor, M. in Schlesinger, M. D. and E. M. Holst. Appendix O: Species Accounts for Select Focal Species. Lake Tahoe Watershed Assessment. O-13. The plant was first collected in 1975 at Yuba Pass on Highway 49 in Sierra County, California, and described to science as a new species in 1992. This is a small, unobtrusive perennial herb forming clumps under 20 centimeters tall, spreading out via tiny stolons. The thin stem is coated in glands and small leaves variable in shape from lance-shaped to rounded. The glandular inflorescence bears flowers with white petals 2 or 3 millimeters long. The fruit is an elongated capsule up to 4.5 centimeters in length. The main potential threat to this rare species is disruption of the soil in its habitat by activities such as grazing, trampling, and logging.

Ovid Butler served as the head of the Board of Directors until 1871. He became Chancellor of the University and, in 1877, the school became Butler University. Butler is also the namesake of the Ovid Butler Society, a recognition society for Butler University's most generous donors.Ovid Butler Society Recreation Butler's summer months were spent at Indiana's Lake Wawasee where he had a residence in the vicinity of Vawter Park Village.Lilly, Eli.

His wife, Evelyn Kreh,Budryk, Peter. \\"So Just Who is Lefty Kreh?\\"http://fishwithkev.blogspot.com/2008/06/so-just-who-is-lefty-kreh.html died in November 2011. They had two children, Victoria and Larry, and several grandchildren, Larry's son Larry Jr, and Victoria's children, Matthew (soon to be married to Katherine), Hillary (married to Ronald) and Sammantha (married to Colin), as well as great-grandchildren from Hillary and Ronald, Alexandria, Allyssa, Ryan, Emily, and William.  Early years  Kreh was born February 26, 1925, in Frederick, Maryland. His parents were Theodore (aka \\"Whitey\\"), who died in a basketball accident when Kreh was eight; and Helen M. Purdy. His father taught him about fishing, and after he died Lefty would bring fish home for his mother and three siblings, Eileen, Dick and Teddy. Lefty served in the Battle of The Bulge. He said they barely ate, and always were cold. He was one of the men help take down the bridge from the Germans, that won the war. After serving in World War II, Kreh was one of three US servicemen infected with anthrax, and the only one to survive. The strain he was infected with was named BVK-I as a result. He began fly-fishing in 1947 while serving as a guide for the famous fly fisherman Joe Brooks.Gowans, Ally. \\"Casting with Lefty Kreh.\\"http://www.letsflyfish.com/lefty_1.htm In 1965 he moved to Miami, Florida, and became the Director of the Metropolitan Fishing Tournament. He wrote for various fishing magazines. He is known throughout to always throw his fish back, keeping the flow in the waters for more fish. He began to fish for saltwater species in the Florida Keys. It was during this time that Kreh, Joe Brooks, Al Pflueger, Tom McNally, George Hommel, Stu Apte and Bob Stearn's pioneered the techniques, deviating from the classic \\"Ten to Two\\" casting technique,\\"Book & Video Reviews: He has said the book of My Life Was This Big by Lefty Kreh,\\" was one he did not like. http://www.thefisherman.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=feature.display&feature;_ID=160&ParentCat;=6 that modern saltwater anglers use to pursue fish with fly fishing gear.  Career  In addition to his fishing accomplishments, Kreh had been an active outdoor writer for more than forty-five years. He wrote for most major outdoor magazines. He was the retired outdoor editor of The Baltimore Sun and held a staff position on several outdoor magazines. Kreh was also an accomplished photographer. On top of all of this, he was part of the TFO rod company and played a key role in the creation of several rods, including the Lefty Kreh series and BVK series (named after the strain of anthrax he survived, BVK-1). \\"Author, Photographer Lefty Kreh to be Honored.http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/author-photographer-lefty-kreh-to- be-honored/article_9d80fe6d-37ca-53e9-9150-432c0070bdd8.html  Creation of Lefty's Deceiver  Brown and white fur Deceiver Lefty's Deceiver is an artificial fly commonly categorized as a streamer fly which is fished under the water's surface. It is a popular and widely used pattern for both predacious freshwater and saltwater game fish. It is generally considered one of the top patterns to have in any fly box.\\"Deceiver Fly Pattern.\\"http://www.orvis.com/store/product.aspx?pf_id=0826 Kreh invented the Deceiver fly in the late 1950s as a streamer that would be easy to cast in wind and would not \\"foul\\" (or wrap around the bend of the hook) a common problem for older streamer patterns. The original Lefty's Deceiver was tied in as a white pattern, but fly tiers have recreated the pattern in a variety of colors. A darker colored top with a lighter bottom (mimicking the various forage fishes that larger fishes feed upon) is the most popular design. The Deceiver is arguably the best-known saltwater fly pattern in the world, and in 1991 the U.S. Postal Service honored Kreh‚Äôs creation with a postage stamp.  Instruction  In 2010, the first \\"Lefty Kreh Flyfishing Challenge Course\\" was created as the centerpiece of instruction at HomeWaters University, which is located in Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania. Kreh designed the course himself, incorporating dry land, still water and moving water into various casting stations. He called it a \\"challenge\\" course, as opposed to a \\"casting\\" course, because he included real-world fly-fishing conditions. Scenarios include the need for long casts, short and precise presentations, casting into the wind, casting with no room for a back cast, and dealing with boulders, rapidly moving water, logs, and other floating debris. A historical journey of Lefty's instruction can be found in the https://flyfishersinternational.org/Portals/0/Documents/Casting/The%20Loop/2017.APR- JUL.LOOP.pdf?ver=2017-08-22-145256-000Loop Publication (April-July 2017) which is published by Fly Fishers International. The piece is a reflection in Lefty's words about his life teaching and instructing fly casting with an interview by Mac Brown.  Awards and honors  Kreh received the prestigious \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" by the American Sportfishing Association, has been honored with the \\"Lifetime Contribution Award\\" by the North American Fly Tackle Trade Association, and is also in the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame. In 1997 he was named \\"Angler of the Year\\" by Fly Rod and Reel Magazine. In 2003 Kreh was inducted to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame. Kreh has served a number of years as Senior Advisor to Trout Unlimited, the Federation of Fly Fishers. Lefty was inducted with https://macbrownflyfish.com/bio-mac-brown/Mac Brown in the category of recreation into the https://flyfishingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame.htmlFly Fishing Museum of Southern Appalachia Hall of Fame in 2018.  Media appearances Video Games: The iPad games Chuckin' Bugs 101 and Olive the Woolly Bugger pay homage to Kreh. One of the main characters, \\"Lefty Crayfish\\", is an anthropomorphized crayfish named after the famous fisherman. Beginning in 2010, Lefty co-hosted the Outdoor Channel fishing show Buccaneers & Bones, along with host/narrator and retired news anchor Tom Brokaw, several other outdoor professionals, and entertainment personalities. The show is shot on location on the coast of Belize and the Bahamas and features the cast teaming up with local guides. The focus of the show is to draw attention to the efforts of The Bonefish and Tarpon Trust, a conservation and research organization dedicated to the preservation of the two warm climate saltwater gamefish species. Legacy Much of Lefty Kreh's personal collection of angling memorabilia, tackle, literature, and original fly patterns are held by the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vermont. Death Kreh died of congestive heart failure at his home in Cockeysville, Maryland, March 14, 2018.

He was killed by British forces near the border with Lebanon. He was born in the village of al-Ja'una near Safad. Commander in 1936-39 revolt Al-Asbah was a disciple of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim reformist preacher and anti-colonialist activist. During the 1936-39 revolt in Palestine, al-Asbah led a rebel band of about 15 men who often set up nighttime checkpoints to ambush British military and Jewish targets before withdrawing to nearby villages and grottoes before the night's end. His rebel band was largely destroyed in a British ambush near the Galilee village of Arraba in mid-1937. Al-Asbah played a key role in reigniting the revolt in late 1937. At that time, he rallied the fellahin (peasants) of the Safad region to fight against the British. Al-Asbah is also known for fighting several battles alongside the Syrian commander Said al-As. Following a battle in Nabi Yusha', the British Army offered a reward of 1,000 Palestine pounds for Al-Asbah, dead or alive. Around March 1938, the British authorities received information on the location of al-Asbah's hideout and besieged al- Asbah and some of his men at a grotto near the border with Lebanon. After they used up their supplies, the rebels began emerging from the grotto opening fire one by one, all being gunned down by British forces. According to local accounts, al-Asbah was the last rebel killed in this confrontation. He was killed by a shrapnel wound to the head and his body left was on the battlefield for 40 days, with the residents of nearby villages wary of retrieving it and being consequently punished by the authorities. Ultimately, residents from the village of Sa'sa' buried the body in their village and informed his family of his death. Commemoration Al-Asbah became a popular figure among the Palestinians of the Galilee following his death for his reputed incorruptibility unlike many other rebel commanders and his refusal to surrender to the British authorities. Local songs were penned for him and were sung at weddings and dabke dances. The following is a Palestinian folk song describing al-Asbah (in Arabic): > ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ≥ ŸàÿßŸÇŸÅ ŸÉÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ≠ŸÖ Ÿàÿ∂ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∂ŸÖ ŸàÿßŸÇŸÅ > Ÿäÿß ÿ±Ÿäÿ™ŸÉ Ÿäÿß ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿ®ŸÇŸäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÇŸÅ ŸàÿµŸàÿ™ŸÉ Ÿäÿ±ÿπÿØ ÿ¨ŸäŸàÿ¥ ÿßŸÑÿπÿØÿß > ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ÿØ Ÿäÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ± ÿ®ŸÑŸÉŸàŸÜ ŸÖÿ™ŸÑŸÉ ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ŸàŸÖÿßÿµÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàŸÜ ÿ≠ÿØÿß > ŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ™ÿ≤ÿπŸÇ ÿ®ÿµŸàÿ™ŸÉ ÿπŸÑŸäŸáŸÖ ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖŸäŸÜ ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿ®Ÿá ÿπÿßŸÑŸä Ÿàÿ∑Ÿä Al-Asbah did not have any children.

He lost his parents as a young boy and was raised in orphanages. In 1924, Fomin joined the Komsomol, at the age of 15. He worked at a shoe factory in Vitebsk and then moved to Pskov. There, he was sent to the Communist Party school to prepare for a career as a professional party worker. In 1930, at age of 21, while at the party school, Fomin became a member of the Soviet Communist Party. When he returned from the school, he was assigned to be a propagandist of the Pskov City Committee of the Communist Party. Army career In 1932 the Party assigned Fomin to the Soviet Army, where he became a political commissar and began a nomadic life of the military: Pskov - Crimea - Kharkiv - Moscow - Latvia. In August 1938, Fomin was designated as the divisional commissar of the 23rd (Kharkov) Rifle Division, in 1940, he served in Daugavpils, Latvia.

On 21 June 1941, Fomin wanted to travel to Daugavpils to bring his family to Brest, but he failed to get a train ticket due to a big crowd of people at the railway station. On 22 June, Fomin was at the Brest Fortress, when the Wehrmacht started the war codenamed Operation Barbarossa. As the only higher commander present he took over the command of the group of Soviet soldiers that defended the Kholm Gate. The battle for the fortress continued for several days. Fomin moved to the northern part of the fortress' Central island where he was captured on 26 June 1941.Kristian Gantser [Christian Ganzer], Irina Elenskaya, Elena Pashkovich, Evgenyy Rozenblat, Sergey Strunets (eds.): Brest.

History Holme Mills centre Holme Mills on Langford Road in Biggleswade, situated next to the River Ivel, was bought by local farmer William Herbert Jordan in 1855. The mill caught fire in 1894 and burnt down again in 1899. It produced flour until 1972, when W. Jordan (Cereals) Ltd was formed. It was run by Bill and David Jordan, who are brothers and were partners of the company until 2010.Companies House filing (TM01) - Resignations of Richard & WIlliam Jordan, 26 May 2010 W. Jordan (Cereals) Ltd has been dormant since 2010 and the business now operates as The Jordans, Dorset & Ryvita Company, a subsidiary of Associated British Foods. There is a factory shop in Langford, Bedfordshire. Its main product it started with, and still produces, is called Crunchy Oats, which is based on granola. A mill was recorded on the site in 1086, as noted in the Domesday Book. In 1981, Waitrose began to stock their products. Also in 1981, Jordans began production of a cereal bar called Original Crunchy. It now produces four different cereal bars including Frusli which contains 25% fruit, Breakfast Bars, Luxury Absolute Nut Bar and Original Crunchy Bars. Country Crisp was introduced in 1991. Luxury Bars were introduced in 2004. In 2002, they formed the joint venture 'the Organic and Natural Food Company' with Yeo Valley Organic. It produced vending machines for schools filled with healthy food. In April 2003, the company won a Queen's Awards for Enterprise. In 2005, Bill Jordan was made a MBE. In September 2007, 20% of the company was sold to Associated British Foods, followed by a further 42% in June 2008, becoming fully owned by ABF by 2013. Conservation efforts Jordans use oats which are grown by Conservation Grade farmers around Britain who are paid a premium to create nature-friendly habitats on 10% of their farmed land. Bill Jordan owns the Nature Reserve at Pensthorpe in Norfolk which is taking part in high profile projects to bring back the rare Eurasian Crane and safeguard British natives such as the red squirrel. Similar to The Co-operative Group, the company is concerned about the rapid decline in the bee population. It started the Big Buzz campaign in May 2009, with the help of the British Beekeepers' Association and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Jordans Mill Visitor Centre Holme Mill itself became a museum in 2013, with the opening of a visitor centre on the site after production transferred to a new facility in Biggleswade's Saxon Gate development area. Market share It is the UK's fourth largest cereals manufacturer after Kelloggs, Nestl√© and Weetabix. 25% of their produce is exported, with France being an important market; half their exports go there, and it is the country's best-selling muesli cereal. The brand leader of crunchy muesli in the UK is their Luxury Crunchy. They belong to the Association of Cereal Food Manufacturers, which is a member of the European Breakfast Cereal Association.

Mission The mission of the Society was: \\"1) To advance the discipline and practice of soil science by professionals, 2) To promote quality interaction between professional soil scientists and their communities, 3) To represent the diverse consulting, service and business interests of professional soil scientists, 4) To facilitate the exchange of business and soil science experiences within the Society, and 5) To foster professional and ethical conduct in the soil science discipline.\\" Professional Certification and Registration The Society provided relevant professional certification and registration with particular emphasis on professional ethics. The NSCSS awarded the Registered Professional Soil Scientist (RPSS) designation in the United States. Integration with the Soil Science Society of America As of August 2011, the NSCSS is a fully integrated part of the Soil Science Society of America. At the May 21‚Äì24, 2011 NSCSS Annual Meeting in Asheville, North Carolina, it was recommended that NSCSS integrate into SSSA to unite and expand the soil science community and form a new Consulting Soil Scientists Division within SSSA. These discussions led to the proposal that was presented to the NSCSS Board of Directors that NSCSS integrate into SSSA and form the new Division with SSSA. After further NSCSS/SSSA discussions regarding the merger, on July 21, 2011, the Board of Directors of the SSSA unanimously voted to create a new Division - S12, for Consulting Soil Scientists (CSS). On July 29, 2011, the NSCSS Board of Directors voted to recommend to the membership that we integrate our corporation and programs into SSSA. In August, NSCSS members were given the opportunity to approve the merger by voting - the results were overwhelmingly (95%) in favor of integrating NSCSS into SSSA.\\" They cited being included under SSSA's corporate umbrella (alleviating financial and administrative demands) and the communications network of the SSSA's Science Policy Office in Washington D.C. as major advantages leading to the choice to integrate. Affiliations The NSCSS was approved as a Chapter of the Soil Science Society of America in 1996. NSCSS achieved Cooperator status with the National Cooperative Soil Survey in 1997, of which it is now a permanent member.NCSS Bylaws NSCSS is a charter member of the US Consortium of Soil Science Associations (USCSSA) and member of the USCSSA governing council.USCSSA Bylaws It is a member of the International Union of Soil Sciences, a union of 86 national and regional soil science societies.

The Fielders were owned by Grand Slam Sports & Entertainment, LLC, based in Deerfield. The primary owner was Richard Ehrenreich. Actor Kevin Costner, whose filmography includes baseball films Bull Durham (1988), Field of Dreams (1989), and For Love of the Game (1999), also had ownership interest in the team. A permanent stadium was never constructed. The Fielders were a member of the Northern League in 2010 and joined the North American League in 2011 as part of the Northern Division. The team announced on April 10, 2012 that they would not be fielding a team for the 2012 baseball season. Ballpark (Temporary) The Fielders began play in 2010 at Carthage College because of funding problems with Zion Ballpark. The Fielders played their first game in Zion on July 2, 2010, at a young Fielders Stadium that didn't include much more than a field and bleachers. Lights were added to the field, and the Fielders played their first night game on Monday, July, 26. After the conclusion of the 2010 season, the temporary ballpark was completely dismantled and construction on a new, permanent stadium was supposed to begin. The park was not ready in time for the beginning of the 2011 season, and, as a result, the Fielders started the season with a 32-game road trip. Temporary stadium construction was again completed in time for the Fielders' home opener on July 3, 2011. Founding The team held a name-the-team contest to decide the nickname. The five finalists were Cowpokes, Luckies, Fielders, Comets, and Skippers. The Fielders name, logo, and colors were unveiled on May 27, 2009 at the Key Lime Cove indoor waterpark in nearby Gurnee, also home to Gurnee Mills and Six Flags Great America.

Career Joe Rucker is the youngest of three children. He was born near Houston, Texas, in a place called Baytown, where his father was working a construction contract. Shortly after his birth, the family moved back to their previous home in Geneva, Florida. Joe grew up listening to his dad, Jerry Rucker, play the guitar and write songs. The family sang on a regular basis at churches and community functions. His sister Michelle (Shelly), vividly recalls him being so shy about being on stage, that he hid behind her while they sang. But that shyness eventually evaporated completely in his late teens, due to (in part) him meeting legendary Grand Ole Opry star, Hank Locklin. The two originally met when Joe was 11, and went on to develop a lifelong friendship until Locklin's death in 2009. Joe often says that first meeting spent with Locklin set off his passion for music like never before, and was a pivotal turning point in his life as a musician. He made the move to Nashville, Tennessee in October 1998. One month later, he was invited by Jack Greene to appear on Ernest Tubb's Midnite Jamboree, which is broadcast from \\"The Air Castle of the South\\",Wsimonlne.com WSM AM Radio 650, and \\"Home of the Grand Ole Opry\\". Since that time, Rucker has made multiple appearances with Bill Anderson, Hank Locklin, Charlie Louvin, Jett Williams, Junior Brown, Paulette Carlson, Glenn Douglas Tubb, Margie Singleton, and others. The Midnite Jamboree is the second oldest live country music radio show in the world. Over the years, it has featured artists such as its original host, Ernest Tubb, along with other stars such as Stonewall Jackson, Martha Carson, Elvis Presley, George Hamilton IV, Loretta Lynn, T. Graham Brown, Randy Travis, Marty Stuart, Patsy Cline, and Hank Williams.Ernesttubb.com Rucker released his first album entitled Nashville Scenes in 2001. He co-produced it with Doyle Grisham. In 2007, his second effort Untangle My Mind was released. This eighteen song project was self produced by Rucker and included duets with Clifford Curry, Hank Locklin, and Eddy Raven. Joe's sister Michelle Donahue is listed as Executive Producer, helping to finance the project. Rucker went to his hometown (Geneva), for the CD release party, and the community center was standing room only. As a musician, Rucker is credited on Locklin's 2006 gospel album, By The Grace of God: The Gospel Album, which also included the Oak Ridge Boys, the Jordanaires, and Gold City.Allmusic.com In late 2009, he joined cartoonist / singer / songwriter Guy Gilchrist as bandleader of his group called The Comics. The group did a series of Christmas shows in December 2009 with guest artists Mandy Barnett and Tommy Cash. Rucker left the group in the fall of 2010.http://guygilchristmusic.com/fr_home.cfm On September 11, 2010, Rucker and his group from Nashville (which included Jennifer Brantley) made his debut on the legendary Wheeling Jamboree out of Wheeling, WV. The Jamboree was once the longtime rival of legendary country radio shows such as the Grand Ole Opry and the Louisiana Hayride and at one time had artists such as Grandpa Jones, Louvin Brothers, the Osborne Brothers, Chickie Williams & Doc Williams, and Jimmy Dickens. On the songwriter circuit, Joe has been in rotation on several of the songwriters rounds in Nashville working with the likes of legendary writers such as Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member, Jerry Foster as well as Jim McBride, Jimmy Payne, Glenn Douglas Tubb, Jimmy Fortune, Dallas Frazier and Marty Raybon. As an artist, Joe has opened or shared the stage with many of Nashville's hit makers such as Eddy Raven, Baillie & the Boys, Mandy Barnett, Jeannie C. Riley, Leona Williams, Bobby G. Rice, Michael Peterson (singer), John Berry (singer), Kevin Sharp, Blackhawk (band), Lila McCann, Lorrie Morgan, Linda Davis, Merrill Osmond, Doug Supernaw, Doug Stone, David Ball (country singer), Jeannie Kendall, Rex Allen Jr., and countless others. In 2013, Joe shared the loss of the music community when his friend and mentor Jack Greene passed away. He was asked to sing one of Jack's signature tunes \\"Statue of a Fool\\" for the Opry Star's Celebration of Life at the Ryman Auditorium. In attendance were several Opry members, including Garth Brooks, who paid Rucker a high complement for his talent and professionalism. Joe continues to write, record, and perform across the country. In recent years he has teamed up with the legendary Margie Singleton, telling crowds on stage and radio that she is his \\"Tennessee Mama\\", while she proclaims him one of her adopted sons. The two write and perform shows together and will have a release of some of their songs in 2019. When not on tour, Joe is often asked to be the guest of Nashville Cowboy Church (a church in the Music Valley area of Nashville which is also broadcast on WSM and other radio outlets all over the globe), led by Dr. Harry Yates and Joanne Cash Yates (sister of the late superstar Johnny Cash). In the summer of 2018, Karen Wheeler released her autobiography entitled My Father's Daughter, which recounts humorous stories on and off stage of Wheeler's life. Joe is mentioned in one of those stories and has several pictures in the book as well. Most recently, Rucker was inducted into the Nashville Chapter of the Academy of Local Musicians Hall of Fame. Others honored with the same recognition include: Jan Howard, Margie Singleton, Jeannie Seely, Tim Atwood, Hawkshaw Hawkins Jr., Scott Sexton, and Exile (American band). Interesting side note: Joe's dad, Jerry Rucker, worked in the Space Shuttle program for more than 35 years, and wrote several songs specifically geared towards the Shuttle program. The first song, called Blastoff Columbia, was used to wake up astronauts Robert Crippen and John Young from their first night in space during STS-1.Hobbyspace.comBpnews.org It was a great honor for the entire family, and the song has been featured in several NASA videos and television news reels regarding the Shuttle program.

It is located near the Mabillon metro station, where the Boulevard Saint-Germain intersects the Rue du Four and the Rue de Buci. The square takes its name from the old French North-American territory of Acadia that was once part of New France.

Acadia is represented, in international forums on the French-speaking world's culture (francophonie), by the Province of New Brunswick. Dedication of this square in Paris was meant to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Acadian flag in 1884 in connection with the second National Acadian Convention.

The ward has existed since elections to Westminster City Council that took place on 4 May 1978. It is named after the West End of London, which covers a wider area. While it has a resident population of about 10,000, its daytime population is around 250,000 due to the high number of businesses in the area. Summary Councillors elected by party at each general borough election. 1978‚Äì2002 The ward of West End was created for the 1978 London borough council elections, returning two councillors. It was part of the City of London and Westminster South constituency.London Borough Council Elections 4 May 1978 From 2002 There was a revision of ward boundaries in Westminster in 2002.The City of Westminster (Electoral Changes) Order 2000 For elections to Parliament, West End is part of the Cities of London and Westminster constituency. It lies in the east of the borough, and its boundaries broadly cover the neighbourhoods of Mayfair and Soho, the southern part of Fitzrovia, and the south-eastern corner of Marylebone. The boundary to the south with St James's ward is Shaftesbury Avenue, Piccadilly, and Hyde Park Corner. The boundary to the west with Knightsbridge & Belgravia ward is Park Lane. The boundary to the north with Bryanston and Dorset Square ward is Oxford Street and with Marylebone High Street ward is Oxford Street, Vere Street, Henrietta Place, Cavendish Square, Harley Street, and New Cavendish Street. The boundary with the London Borough of Camden is Cleveland Street, Goodge Street, Charlotte Place, Rathbone Street, Charlotte Street, Rathbone Place, Gresse Street, Hanway Street, Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road. Like all other wards of Westminster, West End is represented by three councillors on Westminster City Council. The last election was held on 3 May 2018, when all three councillors were elected. Since the ward's creation, all representatives had been elected for the Conservative Party; however, in 2018, the Labour Party gained its first councillor here. The ward is thus currently represented by two Conservatives and one Labour member. =2002 election= http://www.election.demon.co.uk/wcc/cand02.htmlhttp://www.election.demon.co.uk/wcc/wse.html =2006 election2010 election2014 election2018 election=ReferencesExternal links * Full election results since 1978 Category:Wards in the City of Westminster ","title":"West End (ward)"},{"id":"22863013","text":"Alice Roberts may refer to: *Alice Richardson (artist) (fl. 1769‚Äì1777), English pastellist who sometimes exhibited under the name Alice Roberts *Alice Roberts (born 1973), British television presenter, anatomist, and osteoarchaeologist *Alice Roberts (actress) (1906‚Äì1985), Belgian actress *Caroline Alice Elgar, born C.

It was designed by Margaret Hamilton based on her experiences writing flight software for the Apollo program.M. Hamilton and W. R. Hackler, \\"Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo\\", IEEE Computer, Dec. 2008. The language is implemented through the 001 Tool Suite software by Hamilton Technologies, Inc.001 Tool Suite (1986-2020) USL evolved from 001AXES which in turn evolved from AXES all of which are based on Hamilton's axioms of control. The 001 Tool Suite uses the preventive concept of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for its life-cycle development process. DBTF eliminates errors as early as possible during the development process removing the need to look for errors after-the-fact. Philosophy USL was inspired by Hamilton's recognition of patterns or categories of errors occurring during Apollo software development. Errors at the interfaces between subsystem boundaries accounted for the majority of errors and were often the most subtle and most difficult to find. Each interface error was placed into a category identifying the means to prevent it by way of system definition. This process led to a set of six axioms, forming the basis for a mathematical constructive logical theory of control for designing systems that would eliminate entire classes of errors just by the way a system is defined. Certain correctness guarantees are embedded in the USL grammar. In contrast to reactive approaches to program verification, testing for errors late into the life cycle, USL's development- before-the-fact philosophy is preventive, not allowing errors in the first place. A USL definition models both its application (for example, an avionics or banking system) and properties of control into its own life cycle.Dolha, Steve, Chiste, Dave, \\"A Remote Query System for the Web: Managing the Development of Distributed Systems.\\", Chapter 32, Internet Management, Editor Jessica Keyes, Auerbach, 2000. Providing a mathematical framework within which objects, their interactions, and their relationships can be captured, USL ‚Äì a metalanguage ‚Äì has \\"metamechanisms\\" for defining systems. USL's philosophy is that all objects are recursively reusable and reliable; reliable systems are defined in terms of reliable systems; only reliable systems are used as building blocks; and only reliable systems are used as mechanisms to integrate these building blocks to form a new system. Designers can then use the new system, along with more primitive ones, to define (and build) more comprehensive reliable systems. If a system is reliable, all the objects in all its levels and layers are reliable. USL is regarded by some users as more user-friendly than other formal systems.Krut, Jr., B., \\"Integrating 001 Tool Support in the Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis Methodology\\" (CMU/SEI-93-TR-11, ESC-TR-93-188), Pittsburgh, SEI, Carnegie Mellon University, 1993. It is not only a formalism for software, but also defines ontologies for common elements of problem domains, such as physical space and event timing. Formalism for a theory of control A systems philosophy formalism for representing the logic of the control of systems, USL is based on a set of axioms of a general systems control theory with formal rules for its application. At the base of every USL system is a set of six axioms and the assumption of a universal set of objects.Hamilton, M., \\"Inside Development Before the Fact\\", cover story, Special Editorial Supplement, 8ES-24ES. Electronic Design, Apr. 1994.Hamilton, M., \\"001: A FULL LIFE CYCLE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT Development Before The Fact In Action\\", cover story, Special Editorial Supplement, 8ES-24ES. Electronic Design, Apr. 1994. The axioms provide the formal foundation for a USL \\"hierarchy\\" ‚Äì referred to as a map, which is a tree of control that spans networks of relations between objects. Explicit rules for defining a map have been derived from the axioms, where ‚Äì among other things ‚Äì structure, behavior, and their integration are captured. Each axiom defines a relation of immediate domination of a parent over its children. The union of these relations is control. Among other things, the axioms establish the relationships of an object for invocation in time and space, input and output (domain and codomain), input access rights and output access rights (domain access rights and codomain access rights), error detection and recovery, and ordering during its developmental and operational states. Every system can ultimately be defined in terms of three primitive control structures, each of which is derived from the six axioms ‚Äì resulting in a universal semantics for defining systems. All representations of a system are defined in terms of a function map (FMap) and a type map (TMap). With USL, all functions in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of FMaps. Similarly, all types in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of TMaps. FMaps represent the dynamic (doing) world of action by capturing functional and temporal (including priority) characteristics. TMaps represent the static (being) world of objects by capturing spatial characteristics ‚Äì for example, containment of one object by another or relationships between locations of objects in space. FMaps are inherently integrated with TMaps. Three universal primitive structures derived from the set of axioms and non-primitive structures derived ultimately in terms of the primitive structures specify each map. Primitive structures are universal in that they are able to be used to derive new abstract universal structures, functions or types. The process of deriving new objects (i.e., structures, types and functions) is equivalent to the process of deriving new types in a constructive type theory. Primitive functions, corresponding to primitive operations on types defined in a TMap, reside at the bottom nodes of an FMap. Primitive types, each defined by its own set of axioms, reside at the bottom nodes of a TMap. Each primitive function (or type) can be realized as a top node of a map on a lower (more concrete) layer of the system. Resident at every node on a map is the same kind of object (for example, a function on every node of an FMap and a type on a TMap). The object at each node plays multiple roles; for example, the object can serve as a parent (in control of its children) or a child (being controlled by its parent). Whereas each function on an FMap has a mapping from its input to output (domain to codomain), each type on a TMap has a relation between its domain and codomain. A structure relates each parent and its children according to the set of rules derived from the axioms of control. A primitive structure provides a relationship of the most primitive form (finest grain) of control. All maps are defined ultimately in terms of the primitive structures and therefore abide by the rules associated with each structure: A parent controls its children to have a dependent (Join), independent (Include), or decision-making relationship (Or). Figure. 1 The three primitive control structures and their rules form a universal foundation for constructing maps in the domains of time and space as FMaps and TMaps Any system can be defined completely using only primitive structures, but less primitive structures defined by and derived from the primitive structures ‚Äì and therefore governed by the control axioms ‚Äì accelerate the definition and understanding of a system. The defined structure, a form of template-like reuse, provides a mechanism to define a map without explicitly defining some of its elements. An FMap structure has placeholders for variable functions; a TMap structure has placeholders for variable types; a universal structure has placeholders for functions or types. Async is an example of a real-time, distributed, communicating FMap structure with both asynchronous and synchronous behavior. An example of a TMap structure is TreeOf, a collection of the same type of objects ordered using a tree indexing system. Each TMap structure assumes its own set of possible relations for its parent and children types. Abstract types decomposed with the same TMap structure inherit the same primitive operations and therefore the same behavior (each of which is available to FMaps that have access to members of each of its TMap's types). Implementation The process of developing a software system with USL together with its automation, the 001 Tool Suite (001), is as follows: define the system with USL, automatically analyze the definition with 001's analyzer to ensure that USL was used correctly, automatically generate much of the design and all of the implementation code with 001's generator.Ouyang, M., Golay, M.W. 1995, An Integrated Formal Approach for Developing High Quality Software of Safety-Critical Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Report No. MIT-ANP-TR-035.

The campus is now being used by the Bridges Academy. History Corvallis, Our Lady of Corvallis High School, (all girls) was the oldest Catholic High School in the San Fernando Valley until its closure in 1987. It was operated by the sisters of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RSHM). The school was located at 3921 Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Studio City, California just south of Ventura Boulevard. The campus is now occupied by Bridges Academy. In 1941, there were no Catholic high schools in the San Fernando Valley, only elementary schools. Archbishop John J. Cantwell asked the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary(RSHM) to establish the Valley's first high school. Reverend Mother M. Baptiste Holohan and Reverend Mother Gertrude Cain began the search for suitable property and found a home owned by Mr. Henry Rotham on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, a half block south of Ventura. The purchase was made in July 1941, and the sale finalized a month later, August 8, 1941.Archives on the Religious Sacred Heart of Mary; editor/researcher: Plant, Mary Leah On August 13, 1941, the school was blessed by Archbishop Cantwell. Classes were held Rotham's original home beginning on September 15, 1943. 24 students were enrolled. The school was named Corvallis, a combination of two Latin words: cor(da): heart and vallis: valley. The faculty included: Sister Eleanor (Aquinas) Brown (b. Feb. 16, 1908; d. Oct. 23, 2003) a native of Lane, Idaho and member of the RSHM for 73 years was the founding principal of Corvallis High School; Mother de Sales Connor; Mother Philip Hickey, Mother Gregory Naddy, and Sister Bernadette Murphy was the housekeeper. The first school dance was held on November 8, 1941. The first volleyball game was played against St. Agnes High School. During the World War II, the students sold war bonds and stamps for the war effort and were awarded the \\"Minute Man Flag\\". The school was accredited by the state of California in Spring, 1943. Mother Aidan Keating joined the faculty. The first class graduated in June, 1943. When enrollment increased to 140 students during 1945‚Äì1946, a new school building was constructed and finished by May 23, 1947. The Sisters of the RSHM, who had been commuting form Marymount High School in Westwood, moved into the old school building, the original house. At that time the faculty included: Reverend Mother Cecilia Rafter, Superior Mother Aidan Keating, Mother Bernard Thornton, Mother Philip Hickey, Mother Gabriel McCauley, and Mother Johanna Renehan. The auditorium with chapel was constructed in 1962. In 1980 talks were held with the Brothers of the Holy Cross (Notre Dame High School) about establishing a single co-educational secondary school; no agreement was reached. In 1981, for various internal reasons, the RSHM, which owned the property, transferred operations of the school to the lay administration and parents, under the new name, Our Lady of Corvallis. The newly renamed school continued for six more years, eventually closing its doors in June 1987. Many Corvallis students in the late 1980s transferred to Notre Dame, Grant or Van Nuys High Schools (the latter two high schools are public high schools).

Biography Early life and career= He was born as Henrik Appel into a poor Jewish family in Budapest. His father, Gyula Appel was a coachman and a butcher's assistant, his mother, Aranka Weimann was a typist. After his father's death in 1925 who froze to death in a slaughterhouse he was brought up in an orphanage where he also carried out his studies. Later he became a bricklayer's assistant. He changed his family name in 1936 and his first name about at the end of the 1930s, but only in 1946 and in 1955 he officially became Acz√©l and Gy√∂rgy, respectively. He was married in 1939 and two daughters were born from his marriage. He mostly educated himself in an autodidact way, furthermore, he completed the autumn semester at the Academy of Drama and Film besides his work. He started to work as an amateur actor and as a performer. In the beginning, he acted in the company stagione of N√°ndor Alapi, he performed in several minor roles in Budapest, but he also played in Gy≈ër, P√©cs and Balassagyarmat. On 24 December 1938, he held an independent performance at the Liszt Academy. In January 1939 he had his own declamation of poems of Endre Ady, Ferenc K√∂lcsey, Gyula Illy√©s, Mih√°ly Babits, Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi and L≈ërinc Szab√≥. The upcoming anti-Jewish laws blocked him from stage. Between 1942 and 1944 he performed on several occasions in the Goldmark Hall of the Liszt Academy. In the framework of the OMIKE Art Exhibition, and was often featured in the workshops of the workers' organised meetings. At the beginning of the 1930s he joined the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement, and in 1935 he joined the then illegal Communist Party. At the beginning of 1942 he was arrested for illegal communist activities and locked in the prison of V√°c. At the end of 1942 he was summoned to labor service where he managed to disassemble himself and return to Budapest. During the German occupation of Hungary and the Arrow Cross Party's seizure of power in 1944, he was baptized as a Roman Catholic for the sake of the Jews who were being hidden by him or through him. Following the Soviet Occupation of Hungary in 1945, he was first a member of the re-forming communist party's Budapest Party Committee (Hu: Budapesti P√°rtbizotts√°g), later he joined its organisation in the 5th district (Hu: V. Ker√ºleti P√°rtbizotts√°g), and from August 1946 he worked in itsZempl√©n county office. In the 1947 \\"Blue Label\\" election he was elected to the Parliament. He was re-elected in the May 1949 elections, but only two months later, on July 6, he was arrested and sentenced to a life imprisonment in one of the show trials of L√°szl√≥ Rajk. He was released on 25 August 1954, and rehabilitated on 1 September. On November 1, he was appointed director of the Nr. 23 State Construction Company, but he could not get a political position. =Director of cultural policy= Gy√∂rgy Acz√©l grave During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he participated in the armoured defense of the party's headquaerters in the 5th district. ion, he immediately joined J√°nos K√°d√°r's new regime, and on 31 October, he became the founding member of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) and he was elected a member of its Central Committee (Hu: K√∂zponti Bizotts√°g). In the judgment of the revolution and the role of Imre Nagy, he represented the party's \\"softer\\" line. After the Soviet troops crushed the revolt, on 13 April 1957, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Culture. He served as First Deputy Minister of Culture from 10 February 1958 until 18 April 1967. In this position, he gradually grew up (especially under P√°l Ilku's ministership) as a leading cultural politician of the K√°d√°r regime. As a result, Ilku was sarcastically named as the First Superior Minister of Culture, as Acz√©l functioned as the de facto head of the ministry. In a letter to the political committee in the summer of 1957, he raised the notorious \\"three Ts\\". The three T letters are an abbreviation of the Hungarian words for tiltott, t≈±rt, t√°mogatott (En: prohibited, tolerated, supported). This attitude became a real, common practice only in the sixties and seventies. Within its ideological boundaries, his activity was characterized by pragmatism. Due to his extensive personal relationships and his friendship with J√°nos K√°d√°r, the powerful leader of the country and the state party MSZMP, he has had a much greater influence on cultural policy and day-to-day practice. He was in a close contact with important personalities of literary- intellectual life, like Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Gyula Illy√©s and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. On 12 April 1967, he was appointed secretary of the Central Committee of the MSZMP and was entrusted with the general control of cultural life in this capacity. In 1971, he became chairman of the newly formed cultural policy working group within the Central Committee, and held his office until 20 March 1974. Meanwhile, he was elected to the Political Committee of the MSZMP (Hu: Politikai Bizotts√°g) on 28 November 1970. He was forced to leave the post under the pressure of the hardline leftist party faction opposing the 1968 economic-social reforms, but as \\"consolation\\" he was elected the Vice- President of the Council of Ministers (i.e. Deputy Prime Minister) the following day, on 21 March, as well as the chairman of the State Committee for the Kossuth Prize, and in 1980 the chairman of the National Council for Public Education. He resigned from all these positions in 1982, when he returned to his former position in the Central Committee on 23 July. Nevertheless, his career and influence was already in decline. Finally, he was dismissed on 28 March 1985. Subsequently, he was Director General of the Party's Social Sciences Institute (Hu: T√°rsadalomtudom√°nyi Int√©zet) until his retirement in October 1989, and remained a member of the Political Committee until 22 May 1988, when he was not re-elected at the 1988 Party Congress. He played an important role in the failure of K√°roly Gr√≥sz in June 1989 at the Central Committee meeting although he was no longer a member of it. When the MSZMP was officially abolished on 7 October 1989, Acz√©l retired from politics and began writing his memoirs, but he could not finish it: he died on 6 December 1991. Not long before his death, Acz√©l rediscovered his Jewish roots and traveled to Israel.

Until the outbreak of the First World War it was the most numerous sheep breed in southern Carinthia, in Friuli and in Slovenia. Its name derives from the regions of Jezersko and of Solƒçava, formerly in the Austrian Empire, now in Slovenia. It is raised also in parts of Austria, Germany and Italy; a small number were imported to Serbia in 1991. It may also be known as the , or , or as the .  History  The traditional mountain sheep reared for hundreds of years in the Alpine region of southern Carinthia were of the primitive Zaupelschaf type, similar to the Tiroler Steinschaf. They were frugal and hardy, and well adapted to the steep slopes and sparse pasture of the mountains, but yielded little meat and wool of coarse quality. During the eighteenth century, when wool production was the most important attribute of sheep, rams of the now-extinct Padovana breed, known for the fine quality of its wool, were brought from the Italian peninsula and cross-bred with the local ewes. The first description of the resulting breed dates from 1844. By 1880, breeding was mainly concentrated in the area round Seeland (now Jezersko, in Slovenia), and it was for this reason known as the . From there, the breed spread widely, throughout Carinthia, through much of Austria- Hungary, and into the Bavarian Alps. The meat was in demand, and many animals were sent to Paris and to Switzerland for slaughter. In the early twentieth century, demand for wool dropped; attempts were made to improve the meat yield of the Jezersko‚ÄìSolƒçava by cross-breeding with the large-framed Bergamasca, a heavy meat breed from northern Italy. This had the undesirable result of lowering the quality of the wool. Under the (\\"breed cleansing\\") policies of the National Socialist r√©gime, the Jezersko‚ÄìSolƒçava was virtually exterminated by substitution cross-breeding with the Deutsches Bergschaf. After the Second World War the population continued to decline, reaching a low point in the 1980s when only about 200 head remained in Austria. At the end of 2013 the population reported from Slovenia was 17,200; Austria reported 5112‚Äì6500, Germany 727 and Italy 4973.  Characteristics  The Jezersko‚ÄìSolƒçava sheep has black patches around the eyes, which may give it the appearance of wearing glasses. It has a markedly convex profile and is lop-eared; the lower part ‚Äì from one to two thirds ‚Äì of the ears is black. The lips and chin may be flecked with black; the coat is otherwise white. Both sexes are polled (hornless). The hooves are strong.  Use  The Jezersko‚ÄìSolƒçava is a dual- purpose breed, reared both for meat and for its wool, of which it yields per year. The wool is fine and of good quality. Ewes lamb twice a year, with a twinning rate of 70%.

He went directly to his new post, Fort Stoddert, on the Alabama River north of Spanish-held Mobile, near the present Mount Vernon. In this sparsely settled wilderness, he began the foundation of a new court system for what would become the State of Alabama. He lived only a few months, dying of fever after being appointed by President Jefferson as the new Judge of the Superior Court of the Territory of Orleans.

He achieved most of his fame in the late 1790s as the commander of HMS Sylph, a small brig operating in Northern European waters. White was able to capture a number of equivalent French, Spanish and Dutch vessels and on one occasion was instrumental in the destruction of a much larger French frigate by a British squadron. In 1798 he was with the squadron that discovered the French invasion attempt on Ireland and acted as a messenger in the campaign to destroy the invasion force that ended at the Battle of Tory Island. He was later flag captain for Sir John Borlase Warren and participated at the Action of 13 March 1806 and the destruction of the Regulus in 1814. After the war, White largely retired, but retained several shore appointments and rose to the rank of vice- admiral. Life White was born in approximately 1770, the son of wealthy New York City merchant Henry White and his wife Eve Van Cortlandt. Henry White was a member of the New York City Council and President of the New York Chamber of Commerce in 1772-73. The Whites were ardent Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War, and in 1783 the family abandoned their home in New York and move to London. John White joined the Royal Navy soon afterwards. In 1790 he was promoted to lieutenant and served in the French Revolutionary Wars, becoming commander of the brig in 1795.Sabine, p. 147-148 Sylph was a highly successful cruiser in home waters. At the action of 12 May 1796 she captured the Dutch brig Mercury. Then in 1796 she captured the French privateer Phoenix. Sylph assisted in the destruction of the French corvette Calliope at the Action of 16 July 1797. Together, they drove Calliope on shore, where Sylph proceeded to fire on her. When checked a week later, Calliope was wrecked; her crew were camped on shore trying to salvage what stores they could. Pomone confirmed that the flute Freedom and a brig that Anson and Sylph had also driven ashore too were wrecked. In August, Sylph attacked Sable d'Olonne. In 1798, White seized six French, Spanish and American ships in the Bay of Biscay, and during October participated in the opening stages of the Battle of Tory Island. In 1799, White was rewarded with promotion to post captain and was given command of the ship of the line HMS Renown, flagship of his former squadron commander Sir John Borlase Warren. Renown served in the Mediterranean, and in 1801 engaged the defences of Porto Ferrajo.The Annual Register, 1845, p. 267 In 1803, Renown was attached to the blockade of Toulon, and the following year Warren and White were transferred to the ship of the line HMS Foudroyant in Britain, later assigned to find and defeat the French squadrons in the Atlantic during the Atlantic campaign of 1806. These squadrons could not be found, but Foudroyant was engaged at the successful Action of 13 March 1806, when a separate French squadron was defeated and captured. In 1810, White took command of the first rate HMS Hibernia under Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, sailing for the Mediterranean, where he took command of HMS Centaur off Toulon. In 1811 he assisted the Spanish defenders at the first Siege of Tarragona and subsequently involved in the destruction of the Regulus in 1814. After the war, White left active service but continued to advance in rank, becoming a rear-admiral in 1830 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1841, by which time he was a vice-admiral. He served as superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard and in January 1844 was made Commander-in- Chief, The Nore,William Loney RN dying suddenly the following year.

Biography McFarlane was born on February 25, 1955 in Mobile, Alabama and was raised on the family's soybean and chicken farm in Theodore, Alabama. The 6-foot, 7-inch () McFarlane played American football in high school, where he was \\"a monster, a legend\\", who was \\"big enough to get past the gay thing\\" playing football and could then \\"go jump rope with the girls.\\" He attended the University of South Alabama. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1974, serving on the USS Flying Fish (SSN-673) as a nuclear reactor technician. Following his military service, McFarlane moved to New York City in the late 1970s, where he worked as a respiratory therapist. In the early 1980s, McFarlane walked into the offices of Gay Men's Health Crisis, offering to serve as a volunteer. He began a crisis counseling hotline that originated on his own home telephone, which ultimately became one of the organization's most effective tools for sharing information about AIDS. Shortly thereafter, he was named as the first paid executive director of GMHC, helping create a more formal structure for the nascent organization, which had no funding or offices when he took on the role. Larry Kramer, the playwright and gay rights activist who was one of the six founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1982, became a friend of McFarlane's, describing that by the time of his death, \\"the GMHC is essentially what he started: crisis counseling, legal aid, volunteers, the buddy system, social workers\\" as part of an organization that serves more than 15,000 people affected by HIV and AIDS. In December 1983, when GMHC was housed in rundown brownstone and served 250 people with AIDS, McFarlane lamented the inequitable treatment of gays by society at large, noting how \\"We were forced to take care of ourselves because we learned that if you have certain diseases, certain lifestyles, you can't expect the same services as other parts of society\\". McFarlane served as executive director until 1985. McFarlane was one of the founding members of the New York branch of ACT UP. He served as executive director of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS from 1989 until 1994, an organization that uses the talents and resources of the theatre industry to raise funds and distribute grants for AIDS-related causes. He also served as president of Bailey House, a not-for-profit organization that provides shelter for homeless people with AIDS. McFarlane served as the executive director of the Gill Foundation from 2004 until 2008, an LGBT organization founded by Tim Gill and based in Denver that which provides grants and operating support for not-for-profit and community foundations. =Personal= McFarlane lived in Manhattan for many years with his brother David, helping take care of him before his death due to AIDS in 2002. Together with Philip Bashe, he wrote the 1998 book The Complete Bedside Companion: No- Nonsense Advice on Caring for the Seriously Ill, which was based on his personal experiences over more than two decades caring for his brother and other seriously ill friends and family members. According to the dramaturgical information that Kramer passed out after performances of the 2011 revival of his 1985 work The Normal Heart (which was one of the first plays to address the HIV/AIDS crisis), that play's character named \\"Tommy\\" was based on McFarlane. Tommy was played by William DeAcutis in the 1985 original production and by Jim Parsons in the 2011 revival and in the 2014 film. Working together with Kramer, McFarlane was the co-producer of the 1993 production of The Destiny of Me, the Pulitzer Prize-nominated play that was the sequel to The Normal Heart. Shortly before his death, McFarlane wrote the afterword for Kramer's book The Tragedy of Today's Gays. A resident of Denver, Colorado, McFarlane died by suicide at age 54 on May 15, 2009 in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. McFarlane left a letter in which he indicated that he could no longer continue dealing with heart and back problems, which followed a broken back in 2002. He is survived by two brothers. In an interview with The New York Times after McFarlane's death, Kramer spoke about his role at GMHC and described how \\"single-handedly Rodger took this struggling ragtag group of really frightened and mostly young men, found us an office and set up all the programs.\\" Kramer told The Advocate that McFarlane \\"did more for the gay world than any person has ever done\\" and stated that \\"I don't think the gay world knew or knows how great he was and how much he did for us and how much we need him still and how much we will miss him.\\" References Category:LGBT people from Alabama Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:People from Denver Category:People from Mobile, Alabama Category:Suicides in New Mexico Category:United States Navy sailors Category:University of South Alabama alumni Category:1955 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Activists from Alabama Category:People from Theodore, Alabama ","title":"Rodger McFarlane"},{"id":"22863231","text":"The Action of 13 March 1806 was a naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars, fought when a British and a French squadron met unexpectedly in the mid- Atlantic. Neither force was aware of the presence of the other prior to the encounter and were participating in separate campaigns. The British squadron consisted of seven ships of the line accompanied by associated frigates, led by Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, were tasked with hunting down and destroying the French squadron of Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, which had departed Brest for raiding operations in the South Atlantic in December 1805, at the start of the Atlantic campaign of 1806. The French force consisted of one ship of the line and one frigate, all that remained of Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois' squadron that had sailed for the Indian Ocean in March 1803 during the Peace of Amiens. Linois raided British shipping lanes and harbours across the region, achieving limited success against undefended merchant ships but repeatedly withdrawing in the face of determined opposition, most notably at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. With his stores almost exhausted and the French ports east of the Cape of Good Hope that could have offered him replenishment eliminated, Linois decided to return to France in January 1806, and by March was inadvertently sailing across the cruising ground of Warren's squadron. Linois had twice failed to capture, or even seriously engage, large and valuable British merchant convoys on his cruise. When he saw scattered sails in the distance at 03:00 on 13 March 1806, he decided to investigate in his ship of the line Marengo, in the hope that the ships would again prove to be a merchant convoy. By the time he realised that the approaching ships were actually a powerful naval squadron, he was too close to outrun the lead ship, Warren's flagship HMS London. As London engaged Marengo, the French frigate Belle Poule attempted to escape from the approaching squadron independently, but was also run down and brought to battle by the British frigate HMS Amazon. Both engagements lasted over three hours and were bloody, the French ships surrendering after three and a half hours and losing nearly 70 men between them. The battle marked the end of Linois's three-year campaign against British trade and was the second British victory of the Atlantic campaign, following the Battle of San Domingo the previous month. Willaumez eventually returned to France, although without many of his squadron who were destroyed by British operations or Atlantic gales. Linois, despite the criticism levelled at him for his failures in the Indian Ocean, was considered to have fought hard and been unlucky to have encountered such an overwhelming force. Made a prisoner of war, Linois was not exchanged by Napoleon, who criticised his behaviour during the campaign and refused to employ him at sea again. Background An engraving of Sir John Borlase Warren, by Daniel Orme. By March 1806, the French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois had been operating against British trade in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere since the start of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Despatched to India before war was declared, Linois left Brest in March 1803, sailing to the South China Sea in an effort to intercept the China Fleet, a huge merchant convoy from Canton to Britain via Madras that carried goods worth in excess of ¬£8 million.James, Vol. 3, p. 248 On 15 February 1804, Linois encountered the China Fleet, which due to delays with the squadron in India had sailed without its Royal Navy escort.Woodman, p. 194 The loss of this undefended convoy could have devastated the British economy and been the highlight of Linois's career, but instead the French admiral was fooled by a ruse of the convoy commander, Commodore Nathaniel Dance. Dance pretended that some of his East Indiaman merchant ships were disguised ships of the line and engaged Linois at long range, dissuading the French commander from pressing the attack. Dance's merchant ships even pursued the fleeing French squadron for some distance, before resuming their original course.Clowes, p. 338 This affair, known as the Battle of Pulo Aura, was a humiliation for Linois and provoked Napoleon's fury when the Emperor was informed of it by the governor of √éle de France, Charles Decaen.James, Vol. 3, p. 377 An engraving of Charles-Alexandre L√©on Durand Linois, by Antoine Maurin. Six months later, Linois was operating off the Indian port of Vizagapatam when his squadron encountered the British warship HMS Centurion and two merchant ships under her protection. In the ensuing Battle of Vizagapatam, Centurion was badly damaged; one of the merchant ships was captured and the other driven ashore.James, Vol. 3, p. 279 Rather than ensure the capture or destruction of Centurion, Linois refused further combat for fear of damaging his ships in shallow coastal waters and withdrew, again provoking censure from Napoleon.Clowes, p. 350 In August 1805, Linois was engaged with another convoy of East Indiamen in the central Indian Ocean, but on this occasion was confronted by the ship of the line HMS Blenheim under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 29 After some ineffectual skirmishing, Linois withdrew again, unwilling to risk taking fatal damage to his ships so far from a safe port. Although he had seized five Indiamen and a number of small ships that had been sailing individually during his three-year cruise, he failed to make a significant impact on British trade in the region and ruined his reputation as a successful naval commander.Rodger, p. 547 Deciding to switch his operations to the Atlantic after discovering that a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew was searching for him, Linois visited the Cape of Good Hope, where one of his frigates was wrecked. He subsequently cruised the coast of West Africa, capturing two small ships but again failing to make a significant impact on British trade in the region.James, Vol. 4, p. 222 Learning from an American ship that a British expeditionary force had captured Cape Town, Linois decided to return to France with his remaining ships, the 74-gun ship of the line flagship Marengo and the frigate Belle Poule, sailing northwards and crossing the equator on 17 February. Unknown to Linois, he was sailing directly into the middle of a complex series of manoeuvres by British and French squadrons known as the Atlantic campaign of 1806. On 13 December, two large French squadrons sailed from Brest under orders to operate against British Atlantic trade. The first, under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissegues, consisting of the 120-gun Imp√©rial, four other ships of the line and three smaller vessels, sailed for the Caribbean. The second under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, who commanded six ships of the line and four smaller vessels, sailed for the South Atlantic.James, Vol. 4, p. 185 These squadrons were able to escape due to the reduction in the size and diligence of the British continental blockade that had been relaxed in the aftermath of the Trafalgar campaign of 1805, in which 13 French and 12 Spanish ships of the line had been captured or destroyed. These losses significantly reduced the ability of the French and their allies to operate in the Atlantic.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 17 However, all of these ships came from the Mediterranean fleets: the Brest fleet had failed to even leave port in support of the campaign and thus survived unscathed. When the blockade was relaxed, the squadrons were able to break out into the Atlantic without resistance, following their orders to avoid combat with significant British forces and to cruise British trade routes in search of lightly protected merchant convoys. In response, the British rapidly mustered three squadrons of their own in pursuit. The first, under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan, was ordered to the South Atlantic, to operate in the region of Saint Helena. The second under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren was sent to the mid-Atlantic, based around Madeira, while the third under Sir John Thomas Duckworth was detached from the blockade of Cadiz. Duckworth pursued Lessigues to the Caribbean and on 6 February annihilated his force at the Battle of San Domingo, but Willaumez avoided encountering any of the squadrons sent to intercept him. Anticipating Willaumez's return to France, the remaining British squadrons took up station in the Mid-Atlantic.James, Vol. 4, p. 186 Battle On 13 March 1806, Warren's squadron was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of the squadron were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together some distance from the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker.Woodman, p. 215 At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy.Clowes, p. 373 Captain Alain- Ad√©la√Øde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night.Adkins, p. 190 It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire. Linois returned London's fire as best he could, but by 06:00 he realised that he was outmatched and swung away, issuing orders for Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule to escape as best he could. The frigate however, which had been firing at London during the battle, continued engaging the larger ship to give Linois support as he attempted to pull away. At 06:15, Bruilhac sighted Amazon bearing down and also withdrew, pulling ahead of Neale's ship which continued to fire into Marengo. Both Marengo and London had suffered severe damage to their rigging, and neither were able to effectively manoeuvre: as a result, Linois was unable to avoid either Neale's continued fire or shots from Amazon as Parker swept past in pursuit of Belle Poule.Woodman, p. 216 By 08:30, Parker's frigate was alongside Bruilhac's and the ships exchanged fire over the next two hours, Amazon succeeding in damaging Belle Poule's rigging to prevent her escape. Behind the battling frigates, Marengo had taken further battering from London and by 10:25 also came under fire from Foudroyant, and HMS Repulse under Captain Arthur Kaye Legge. HMS Ramillies under Captain Francis Pickmore was also rapidly coming into range.Adkins, p. 191 In the face of this overwhelming force, the French ship of the line had no option but to surrender, although by the time the tricolour was lowered at nearly 11:00, both Linois and Captain Joseph-Marie Vrignaud had been taken below with serious wounds.James, Vol. 4, p. 223 Almost simultaneously with the surrender of Marengo, Captain Bruilhac surrendered Belle Poule, the damage inflicted by Amazon and the presence of Warren's squadron persuading him that further resistance was hopeless.Clowes, p. 374 French losses in the engagement were severe, Marengo suffering extensive damage to her hull and rigging and losing 63 men killed and 83 wounded from a crew of 740. The latter included both Linois and his son with serious wounds and Captain Vrignaud, who had to have his right arm amputated. Losses on Belle Poule included six killed and 24 wounded from her complement of 330. British losses were comparatively light, London suffering ten dead and 22 wounded and Amazon four killed and five wounded. London was the only British ship damaged, mainly in her rigging, which was hastily repaired in the aftermath of the battle. Aftermath On 23 April, a heavy storm swept the Eastern Atlantic, striking Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and taking on a large quantity of water that had to be pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned.Adkins, p. 192 Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 29 Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with less than half of the ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a footnote to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage.James, Vol. 4, p. 224 Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847. The engagement was not quite the end for Linois' squadron: the last survivor, the frigate S√©millante had originally been ordered to sail for Mexico in March 1805. This plan was foiled by an encounter with the British frigate HMS Phaeton in the Philippines, and Captain L√©onard- Bernard Motard returned to the Indian Ocean, operating for the next three years against British shipping from √éle de France.James, Vol. 4, p. 153 Eventually the old frigate was assessed as worn out and sold from service in 1808, operating as a privateer for a year before she was captured in 1809.Clowes, p. 413 Napoleon refused to exchange Linois for a British prisoner, and the Emperor's fury at the admiral's failures in the Indian Ocean prevented any subsequent appointments. In 1814, after Napoleon's abdication, the new French regime made Linois governor of Martinique, but when the Hundred Days began, Linois declared for Napoleon and the British invaded and captured his island.Marley, p. 376 His career over, Linois retired. He died some 34 years later, in 1848.

Early life Journois was born on 13 November 1896 to Pierre Hyppolite Journois (4 March 1858 ‚Äì 7 January 1935) and Henriette Grilli√®re (7 February 1858 ‚Äì 27 June 1906). Journois had a sister Georgette and a brother Roger, fraternal twins born on 21 April 1903. Roger died in infancy in December 1904. Journois lived in the commune of Bosc-Bordel in the Normandy region of France, and went to elementary school there until he and his family moved to the commune of Buchy in northern France in 1906. On 27 June of that year, Journois's mother died; his father remarried on 6 October 1908 to Anne Marie Grebeauval. Following the move, Journois went to elementary school in Buchy. Later, he was sent to boarding school at Armenti√®res in northern France. He was an excellent student and was accepted at the School of Arts and Crafts in Armenti√®res where he hoped to become an engineer. Military careerWorld War I= When World War I began in 1914, Journois was too young to be enlisted and stayed in school. One year later, on 13 April 1915, he was called up and enlisted into the 3rd Engineers Regiment. He was then transferred to the 101st Infantry Regiment on 29 May 1915 and was sent on the same day to the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr (St. Cyr Special Military School) to become an officer. He stayed there until 1 September 1915 and was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer. He was assigned to the 103rd Infantry Regiment on 2 October 1915 and, a few days later on 7 October, to the 130th Infantry. He was deployed to the front on 5 December 1915. He fought with the 9th Battalion of the 130th Infantry until 25 March 1916, when he was transferred to the 412nd Infantry. In April, his battalion was in Champagne at the Boyaux camp. He was temporarily promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant on 29 June 1916. He was awarded his first Order of the Army Corps on 3 July 1916, making him a recipient of the Croix de guerre with bronze star. He stayed in the Verdun area until May 1917, when he was lightly wounded in the face. His battalion took a position in Helly Ravine, close to the village of Fleury, at Caurri√®res Wood. In the trenches at Caurri√®res Wood, he was briefly taken prisoner of war. This action gave him his second Order of the Army Corps on 29 July 1917, the Croix de guerre with palm. On 6 July 1917, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant. During July 1917 he saw action at Fort Vaux at Fort Souville, in the Caillete ravines, and in Bazil. At the end of the July and in the August he took part in the attack retaking Vaucouleurs, which got him back his War Cross with palm. In the September he fought at Andernay. In January 1918, the 412nd Infantry broke through Domr√©my-La-Pucelle. In the February and March, he was in the Nom√©ny sector. In May, he was in the area of Croix-en-Ternois, Pas- de-Calais. In the June and July, he was in the Verzy area (Aisne) where he was wounded in the leg. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 16 June 1918, and in July 1918 received his third medal: a Divisional Order of 27 July 1918 awarded him a Croix de guerre (Silver Star). On 3 August 1918 he obtained his fourth citation, the Order of the Army Corps (Bronze Star). In August and September 1918, he was treated at the hospital at Argentan, Orne. On his return to his regiment in October 1918, he participated in an attack that earned him another medal, the Order the Army Corps (Red Star) on 3 December 1918. After the Armistice, the Colonel commanding the 412nd Infantry was to award him a sixth citation, the Order of the Regiment (Bronze Star), dated 27 February 1919. =Cilician campaign= After the German surrender, Journois chose to stay in the army and continued his service in the 412nd Infantry. He remained in the Laon area (Aisne) until May 1919 before removing to Sorgues (Vaucluse) to prepare for his departure to the Levant, because after the war a national resistance movement against the Allies had developed in the Ottoman Empire. During the war Turkey had been allied with Germany. The Paris Peace Conference sought to apply the principles of self-determination to the Arab and Armenian minorities, which endorsed the division of the empire between France, Italy, and Greece. Even though the Sultan had accepted the Allies' propositions, the arrival of 20,000 Greek soldiers was enough to ignite Turkish opinion in a desire for revenge and to rally many supporters of the national movement of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. The military uprising began on 5 August 1919. Under the orders of General Gourand, French troops were sent to the Levant to relieve the British troops in Syria and Cilicia. A company from this regiment, under Commander Mesnil, was designated to take up a position in Pozanti. Journois, Mesnil's Assistant Officer, took part in this. He took part in preparing the support base to resist assaults and repel Turkish attacks. He took part in defense and in counterattacks. He suffered a siege, the French reinforcements having never arrived, and decided to return to the French battle lines. He participated in the night march to avoid the Turkish forces and fell with what was left of the battalion in an ambush; everyone became Turkish prisoners. He was held captive for a year and four months, from 30 May 1920 to 25 September 1921. During this captivity, on 6 June 1920, he was named Knight of the Legion of Honor and upon his release, on 24 October 1921 he was inducted into the Order of the Army of Levant and received the War Cross in Foreign Operations, with palm. =War of the Rif= On his return to France at the end of the campaign, he took leave and then was assigned to the 23rd Algerian Infantry Regiment (\\"Skirmishers\\") in occupied Germany at Wiesbaden. He served from 26 April 1922 to 28 April 1924. He was first assigned to a company and then became deputy chief officer of the battalion. In 1923, he was employed for company and platoon level instruction of junior ranks. He also served as a mathematics teacher for candidates at the National School for Active Servicemen in Saint-Maixent. On 28 April 1924, he was seconded to Versailles to take technical courses in reception and transmission . He joined his unit on 23 July 1924 and remained in Germany with the 23rd Algerians until 9 August 1925, when he posted back to make transmissions with the Army of the Rhine. His regiment was assigned to serve in Morocco, where he landed on 13 August 1925. He was posted on 23 August at the Moroccan state headquarters of the 3rd Marching Brigade until 3 March 1926 and took part in all operations. During the September and October he took part in all operations of the brigade (Bab Mezraoua, Sof Azeroual, Messaoud...) These operations earned him a Brigade citation on 15 February 1926 and so the War Cross with Bronze Star. On 5 March 1926 he returned to France on duty leave and was made available to the General Commander of the Overseas Territories. On 22 June 1926, he was again ready to make another trip to Morocco. He was assigned to the 15th Regiment of Algerian Rifles and was in the ranks on 23 June 1926. He was posted on 26 June at the Group General Staff HQ in Fes. He served as an officer of the 4th Office. In August, he was promoted to as an honorary captain. He performed many tasks to link on the front north and operations of the task of Taza. These acts earned him a citation to the order of the Army Corps with a star on the Vermeil Croix de Guerre des TOE dated 14 November 1926. He also received the Colonial Medal with vermeil clip \\"Morocco 1925 - 1926\\". =Back in France= In 1927 he was seconded by the chief of staff as chief officer in charge of communications, then made responsible for instructing No 1 European Company and Platoon. At the end of June, he was seconded as an officer on an order from General P√©tin (no link with Mar√©chal P√©tain). On resuming his service, he prepared for the entrance examinations of the School of War. He remained with P√©tain until June 1928. He was promoted to captain on 26 March 1928. He left Morocco and at the end of his leave, he was posted to 152nd Infantry Regiment at Colmar on 9 November 1928. He took command of the 9th Company and served until 31 October 1930. During this time, he attained entrance to the School of War. During his stay in Colmar in the 152nd Infantry, one of his companions (and future brother-in-law) got him permission to spend time at Bonnal, Doubs, a small village where he met his future wife. He was admitted to the Ecole de Guerre (School of War) in Paris on 1 November 1930. His studies and subsequent coursework over two years at the School of War were noted to be brilliant. He was the first in his class on 31 October 1932. He was married at Besan√ßon on 8 April 1931, and on 14 February 1932, his first son, Jean Claude, was born in Paris. He was assigned an internship at the General Staff of the 7th Military Region in Besan√ßon where it was announced by the Superior School of War as a matter of choice. As an intern, he went through all the offices of the General Staff where he fulfilled all his duties satisfactorily. At the end of the probationary period, he remained assigned to the staff of the 7th Military Region and in mid-August 1934 he was posted to the 3rd Office. He served in 1935 and 1936, dealing with issues of \\"coverage\\" and the preparation of maneuvers to be performed by the divisions of the corps. Meanwhile, his second son Jacques was born in Besan√ßon on 27 December 1933 and on 8 July 1936 his third son Pierre was born. He left the General Staff of the 7th military region and on 1 November 1936 was assigned to the 60th Infantry Regiment to complete his commission. He commanded CA2, machine-gunners which he pulled into a remarkable team. He relinquished command of the 60th Infantry on 16 April 1937 and was entered in the competition to be named an officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur. On 16 April 1937 he was assigned the command of 5th Battalion of Foot-Soldiers in Heather, Vosges with a mission to rebuild it into a combat unit. He was able to do this in a few months in spite of difficulties due to the dispersion of its various companies and an inadequate barracks. He was promoted to the grade of chief of the battalion (commander) on 25 June 1937 and named officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 2 December 1937. His battalion was fully consolidated in Bruy√®res by mid-1937. In 1938 and 1939, he had got the unit all fighting fit and in the mobilization of September 1939 as a unit ready to fulfill its mission in an armored unit. = The Battle of France = After the declaration of war, Journois was not to command his battalion in battle to his regret and sorrow. In view of his value and his moments of brilliance, he was posted on 2 October 1939 at the Supreme Headquarters of the territory of operations in the north-east at 310th Office. On 28 January 1940, he was assigned to the General Staff of the Commander in Chief on the front north-east, 3rd Office. During the active phase of operations, he was particularly distinguished by missions to the IX Army in Belgium (Corapi Army) and the II Army (General Huntziger) during the Battle of the Bulge. He received the Order of the Army (Croix de Guerre with palm 39/45). Falling back, the Supreme Headquarters moved south. Commander Journois was in Vichy on 16 June, at Montauban on the 21st, at Mont√©limar on the 25th, at Capvern on the 26th and in Bordeaux the same day. He was designated to be a member of the French delegation that was chaired by General Huntziger to the German Armistice. He went to Wiesbaden in Germany where the committee headquarters were located. He stayed from 29 June to 17 September 1940. There he saw, like all members of the Armistice, the German desire to humiliate \\"the vanquished\\". This stay was interrupted by short visits from German to France, two in July (he saw his family for four days on the second visit) and one in September. Upon his return, on 17 September 1940 he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of State for War in Vichy, under General Charles Huntziger the Secretary of State for War until Huntziger died in a plane crash on 12 November 1941. Meanwhile, Journois was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 25 March 1941. On 1 January 1942, he was assigned to the Office of the Admiral of the Fleet (Admiral Darlan) as deputy to the Chief of Staff, General Revers. On 16 April 1942, he was transferred to the General Staff of the Commander in Chief of the military forces of Land, Sea and Air, where he acted as Deputy Chief of Staff. Then began a period clandestine and covert activities. The French ResistanceThe underground= With General Revers, who was his leader in hiding, Journois chaired a number of secret meetings during which he studied the possibilities of resistance to the enemy and the establishment and organization of resistance networks. During this time, he travelled to North Africa with Admiral Darlan. He served in this capacity until 25 November 1942 when he was discharged as a result of the Anglo-American landings in North Africa and the invasion of Free France by the Germans. He went on leave in March 1943. He was recalled to duty on 25 April 1943 and appointed Commander of the Nice division. He was promoted to Colonel on 25 May 1943. He assumed his post on 3 May 1943 and fulfilled his role until 1 November 1943 when he was released again. Meanwhile, as of January 1943, Journois was appointed by his superiors in the underground, as head of the Resistance Army (ORA) in the Alpes-Maritimes region. The ORA was the organization he helped establish in 1942 when he was the Deputy to General Revers. Also in January 1943 he joined the network \\"Alliance\\" branch of \\"Druid\\" with the nickname of Marcelle Suzanne. He was one of the agents of the France P2 combatants. In June 1943, the unity of the resistance in the Alpes Maritimes cocooned him. =Denunciation and arrest= After his release, Journois returned full-time to the underground resistance. Although easily discovered by the Gestapo, he remained at his post, fighting. He was identified by a double agent who was placed in the same cell when he was arrested, who managed to earn their trust. He was arrested in Nice on 4 January 1944 with Captain Dupouy, his deputy. Even when interrogated, beaten and tortured by the Gestapo he did not give up secrets. He was incarcerated in a Nice prison, where his presence remained a secret until May 1944. On 18 May, as a result of negotiations by his stepfather with the German authorities from Lyon, Marseille and Nice, his wife and children were able to enter the premises of the Gestapo to visit him. During his detention at Nice he was able to write seven \\"letters\\" to his family despite German censorship. He found an ingenious way to communicate secretly: filling his dirty laundry package with long, patiently written letters printed in pencil on three lines of his pyjama cords. Prudence dictated that his wife washed out these writings. However, the last braid was retained. Time has erased these but the text was always kept having been transcribed onto paper. Just before 25 May 1944 (the date of the solemn communion of his eldest son, who had helped his stepfather for the negotiations of 18 May), he was transferred to Marseille to the Baumettes Prison. On 17 June 1944, the Germans evacuated the prison to Belfort (Territoire de Belfort). The Allies' Invasion of Normandy had started a few days earlier, on 6 June 1944. Faced with the possibility of another Allied landing on the Mediterranean coast (which would occur in August 1944), the resistance detainees were sent from Marseille to Fort Hatry in Belfort. The trip lasted four days and nights during which they traveled in cattle trucks. Upon arrival, they were crammed into cells. Georges Journois shared his cell with Colonel Bernis from Monaco and Grimonet from Marseille, both of whom had the good fortune to be released from Belfort because their paperwork was missing. In the last days of their incarceration at Fort Hatry, a dozen senior officers were gathered together in one cell, including the following: *Colonel Piton from Nice, died 26 January 1945 *Colonel Souquieres from Gap died 10 November 1944 *Lieutenant-Colonel Ribiollet from Gap, died 3 May 1945 *Colonel Journois from Nice, died 26 September 1944 *Bernis from Monaco, freed at Belfort *Lieutenant Colonel Berrurier from Gard, died 11 April 1945 *Colonel Vitrat from Le Mans, died 17 December 1944 On 28 August 1944 (also the date that Nice was liberated), a convoy of trucks was formed, crammed with prisoners from Fort Hatry and from the west of France. The trip in cattle trucks lasted four days, with no straw and little food. On 1 September 1944, Journois arrived at the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, a concentration camp in northern Germany. DeportationAt the Neuengamme camp= The SS, with fierce dogs, guarded the prisoners while the trucks went to the death schlague. The trucks were taken to the camp and parked in the dirt under a large brick building. The prisoners were crowded, tight against each other and the wait began. They waited until groups they were called, stripped, their belongings taken, shorn, registered and tattooed on the forearm. Journois became the number \\"43936\\". he had to learn this number in German by heart so as to respond as soon as it was called, on pain of being beaten with batons. The prisoners were transferred to the \\"quarantine\\" blocks. But for the great majority of them, this \\"quarantine\\" did not last. They were designated and grouped with other inmates of all nationalities who had arrived before them at Neuengamme to form a commando of more than 1,100 men. After being dressed in the prisoner's uniform of blue and white vertical stripes they were taken by train to the main German naval base on the North Sea: Wilhelmshaven. This command, created by the Germans on the site of a former Hitler Youth camp, is located from the arsenal, where they were sent to work making parts for pocket submarines. The prisoners arrived on 5 September 1944. Initially they were supervised and guarded by the French SS (Charlemagne division). The Kapos who supervised them had also been given a caretaker role by the Germans, and had the power of life or death over the prisoners for whom they were responsible. These prisoners were mainly held under German criminal law (Green triangle). On arrival, Journois was assigned to Block 3 which would later be decommissioned. At the armoury, he worked in a small workshop beside the forge, where he did ironmongery. He stayed there from 5 September 1944 to 25 September 1944, or 20 days. The schedule was as follows: Wake up, black water called \\"unsweetened coffee\\", marching (\\"the five\\"): a route, work in the arsenal, dinner, a little bread and \\"unsweetened coffee\\". There were calls, endless talking about billets, at all hours. For food, only unusually was there some meat in the soup and a few times they saw a bit of jam or margarine. =Assassination= On 25 September 1944, upon her return to work, his studio rapport woman reported the number 43936, George Journois for some \\"misconduct\\" committed. He was called to the center of the square of Appeal, and was savagely beaten by the rapport men. He stood up and asked to be treated as an officer prisoner and not as a regular prisoner. The rapport continued to bludgeon him then called timeout as they were tired. They came back later and continued to badger him. After this \\"execution\\", he was taken to the \\"Revier\\" (hospital) where, after some treatment, he was back to his block. In the corner where a few officers had gathered, he was lying on his bench. The night passed and the next morning his friends found that he had died in the night. He was the first French Commander to die, only one Russian had preceded him. One of his companions called for a minute's silence in the block and everyone, whatever his nationality, respected it. The Kapos made them all aware that if such a thing happened again, there would be reprisals. He was buried in a coffin in the cemetery of Wilhelmshaven, as were the first few victims that followed, but it did not last. After the war, his body was repatriated and he was buried in Besan√ßon in the family vault. Awards and recognition *On 15 October 1945, he posthumously received the M√©daille de la R√©sistance, and on 6 May 1946 Bernard Montgomery awarded him a \\"Certificate of Service\\". On that day he was commissioned to the rank of Brigadier-General, 20 August 1944 *Decision 900 of 30 March 1954 by the French Minister of National Defense gave him a posthumous Croix de Guerre with palm: \\"Member of the French Forces of the Interior\\" (FFI). Arrested 4 January 1944 for acts of resistance. Deported to Germany 29 August 1944, died 31 October 1944.\\" The actual date of his death was 26 September 1944. *La carte de D√©port√© R√©sistant lui est attribu√© le 23 July 1951 ce qui lui vaut la m√©daille de la D√©portation pour faits de R√©sistance. *La carte de combattant volontaire de la r√©sistance lui est attribu√©e le 4 December 1951 qui donne droit √† la Croix du combattant volontaire de la R√©sistance. *He also received the M√©daille comm√©morative de la guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (Commemorative War Medal). *Journois's body was exhumed from the Wilhelmshaven cemetery on 9 February 1949. Transferred to the French, the body arrived at Bad Ems in the French Zone of Occupation on 11 February 1949 where a homage was given to their glorioux soules by a delegation of officers and ranks. It was delivered to Strasbourg on 12 February 1949 from where it travelled to Besan√ßon until 9 March 1949. It was with the Bescan√ßon town council on 11 March 1949 who placed his coffin in a Chapel of Rest at the Town Hall. Military honours were given on 16 March 1949. After a religious ceremony in the Saint Peter Basilica, the coffin was placed on a prolonge d'artillerie , and crossed the town of Besan√ßon where the 27th Regiment of the Infantry of the Line gave their honours. An officer carried his decorations on a cushion and followed the funeral procession. On arriving at the cemetery, his coffin was carried to the family grave on the shoulders of six Army men.. After the burial, three homages were given to him by Monsieur Baverel, the erstwhile concentration camp prisoner, by the Mayor of Besan√ßon, and by Colonel Guenin, the Besan√ßon Army Commander. * Six years later, on Sunday 18 September 1955, the city of Buchy, Seine-Maritime (where he had lived as a child) named a street after him, with plaques engraved: Rue du G√©n√©ral Georges Journois Martyr de la R√©sistance 1896 - 1944 * His name also appears on the war memorial at Buchy and the Deportation Monument at the Chaprais Cemetery at Besan√ßon.

Vawter Park is an unincorporated area of shoreline and nearby neighborhoods located on the south shore of Lake Wawasee, Indiana, United States. History Vawter Park is located near N. Southshore Drive and E. Vawter Park Road. It was plotted in 1887 by John Terrell Vawter born in Vernon, Indiana, in 1830. John Vawter was in the retail pharmaceutical business in Franklin, Indiana, and later got involved in meat packing and was prominent among bankers, becoming a director and stockholder in a national bank in Franklin. In 1886 Vawter went to his farm on the almost completely unsettled southern shore of the lake to reside.Vawter Family: Archives Vawter Park Hotel Around 1888, the Vawter Park Hotel was constructed and was followed by a row of cottages extending to the southeast of the hotel. The hotel is said to have been built and furnished with Victorian era gentility. Those settling in this area were Ovid Butler of Indianapolis, Charles A. Sudlow of Indianapolis, Oran Dunn, Dr. Grayston, E.C. Miller, James C. Norris, the Fargo family, an E.C. Miller. In 1918 or 1919 Vawter Park Hotel burned to the ground. Around 1920 a new hotel was built on the site only to burn down between 1920 and 1925. The South Shore Inn would take its place in subsequent years. Indiana University Biological Station A biological research station operated by Indiana University was active just north of Vawter Park Village. This research station was involved in hydrographic mapping and the bathymetry of Wawasee prior to 1895.Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, Indiana Academy of Science, v. 5, 1895Indiana Purdue Univ., Hydrology map 1895  South Shore Inn  The South Shore Inn was a hotel built on the site of the old Vawter Park Hotel. It was a 2-story, 60-room building with a large central semi-circular veranda facing the lake with wings off to both sides. The south end had a bar and restaurant. The hotel had sidewalks descending a series of grass terraces with two goldfish ponds near the seawall flanking the sidewalk. During the great 1943 storm, it took in survivors nearly drown by 6 and waves. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the hotel attracted visitors and patrons with a water ski jumping show. The South Shore Inn caught fire in the early morning hours of October 29, 1964. Fire departments from Syracuse, nearby North Webster and Milford responded. By 3:53 am the South Shore lay in complete ruin. Loss of the structure was estimated at $250,000. The property lay abandoned for several years eventually becoming condominiums. The location was just north of N. Southshore Drive and E. Vawter Park Road. Sources *Lilly, Eli. Early Wawasee Days. Indianapolis: Studio Press Inc., 1960. (most text).

(NTI) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization focused on placing Americans with Disabilities and Disabled Veterans in jobs since 1995. NTI is headquartered in Downtown Boston with virtual personnel across the United States. As the pioneers in the industry, NTI has initiated the evolution of telecommuting, helping Americans with Disabilities and has set the standards for a work-at-home environment for over 20 years. Since the inception of NTI, the non-profit has expanded into 3 Divisions: NTI@Home, LandAjob, and The Staffing Connection. The Medical Transcription (MT) division was disbanded at the end of 2014. The NTI@Home division is dedicated to placing Disabled Veterans and Americans with Disabilities in Work at Home positions. The primary roles NTI fulfills include Call Centers, Sales, Customer Service, Tier I and Tier II Help Desk roles for Fortune 500 companies such as IBM, Meijer, Amazon, and Sykes. In addition, NTI has provided third party services to staffing agencies to help with their 508 needs. Not only does NTI supply the people, but the call center technology as well. History Dr. M.J. Willard Monkey from Helping Hands On June 23, 1995, NTI was started by the 3 founders, Dr. Paul Corcoran, Chairman of the Rehabilitation Department at the Tufts New England Medical Center; Dr. Mark Schlesinger, Chairman of Health Economics Department at Yale; and Dr. M.J. Willard, Behavioral Psychologist who had spent the prior 15 years working with individuals with severe physical disabilities function within their home environment. Prior to NTI, Dr. Willard had spent three years as a research assistant to famed psychologist B.F. Skinner and concluded that his behavior- modification methods could be used to train monkeys to help the disabled. Dr. Willard then focused her efforts on a non-profit called Helping Hands: Simian Aides for the Disabled which was started in 1977. She spearheaded the concept of using moneys to assist quadriplegics in daily tasks. In the early 1990s Dr. Willard further explored existing work opportunities for individuals with physical disabilities who wanted to work from their homes. In her quest, Dr. Willard discovered that there was little being done in this field. At the time, work at home positions were scarce and she was able to place individuals only on a one on one basis. The original work at home positions consisted of appointment reminder calls for medical practices and hospitals, data entry, book indexing and medical or legal transcription services. However, Dr. Willard was faced with a dilemma having too many individuals with disabilities to place and not enough work-from-home positions in the workforce. With research funding from the Department of Education, Dr Willard interviewed experts in the employment field, who recommended she look at the areas of customer service and the call center industry. Industry experts felt these two fields would grow exponentially in terms of virtual environments. Forty years ago, virtual call center agents did not exist. Today the industry employs over 3 million Americans. Currently, 53% of call centers in the US employ remote call center agents. Experts predict the trend will continue, driven by economic issues. Software and hardware technology has improved to where call center managers have many options that let them monitor, coach, and escalate calls to remote agents with the same ease as if the agent was located in a physical call center facility. The call center environment did indeed prove a good source of jobs for people with disabilities who needed to work from home. NTI's trained virtual agents meet the business needs of both government and commercial call centers. Typically, NTI places between 500 and 600 people with disabilities into call center jobs every year.

Organizations and programs that have generously provided grants and donations to NTI include The AT&T; Foundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, The Fidelity Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation the U.S. Department of Education: RSA Project With Industries, and the U.S. Department of Labor: Office of Disability Employment Policy.\\" National Telecommuting Institute (NTI) Providing Home-Based Employment Opportunities For People with Disabilities\\" World Institute on Disability =Employment Fields= Initially, the fields such as indexing, medical billing, legal and medical transcription, proofreading, and appointment reminder services were amenable to telecommuting. However, over the past 14 years most of these positions have faded away due to the evolution of cloud based services and technology such as Dragon Dictate that have revolutionized transcription. Now, the greatest opportunity to employ individuals with disabilities in at home positions exists within the fields of Customer Service, Sales, and Technology Services; such as Tier I and Tier II support.

Collectively, state VR agencies operate with a budget of $2.8 billion. The VR agencies have staff and a charter to develop home-based opportunities, but relatively few alternatives to offer their clients within their immediate communities. State agencies often use some of their funds to purchase services from non-profit organizations such as NTI when their clients in the disability community require specialized assistance.

Stanley's tenure at Stony Brook was marked by controversial cuts to the university's humanities funding and the creation of a $35 million budget deficit. On May 28, 2019, Stanley was named president of Michigan State University, officially assuming his position on August 1. Early life and education Samuel L. Stanley Jr. attended Winston Churchill High School, a National Blue Ribbon School, located in Potomac, Maryland and graduated in 1972. He then attended The College of the University of Chicago where he graduated with honors in Biological Sciences in 1976 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in the same year.http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/6557.aspx=all Vice-Chancellor of Research at Washington University As an Albert Schweitzer fellow of Harvard Medical School, Stanley received his MD specializing in Internal Medicine in 1980.http://hms.harvard.edu/alumni- search?LastName=stanley&FirstName;=samuel&GradYear;=1980&id;=DC0eXHkBaUdudBxhNUR6KDsNMB8jEAJjVSYAcyh- GwF1ZQAb= all HMS- Alumni  Career  He served as a medical intern at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1980 and 1981 and stayed to complete his residency in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was appointed as an associate member of the American College of Physicians. During his time at Mass General, Stanley met colleague and future wife, Dr. Ellen Li, who was concurrently completing her residency in internal medicine.http://www.stonybrookphysicians.com/doctor/LI_MD_ELLEN_2884.asp= all Stony Brook Physicians- Ellen LI, M.D., PhD Between 1983 and 1984, Stanley was a fellow in infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-samuel-stanley- xmtsj/education=all Dr. Samuel Stanley- Educationhttp://www.stonybrook.edu/pres/lady.html=all About the President: First Lady While there, he was a Pfizer Postdoctoral Fellow in microbiology and immunology. He became a professor in the department of medicine, and served in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Molecular Microbiology. Stanley also served as director of the National Institutes of Health-funded Midwest Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research. In 2006, he was named vice-chancellor for research at Washington University. =President of Stony Brook University= On May 12, 2009, Stanley was named the fifth president of Stony Brook University, a position he formally assumed on July 1, 2009, making him the first physician to serve as Stony Brook University's president. Stanley faced a $13 million budget deficit upon his arrival, which ballooned to $21 million by December 2009, leading Stanley to enact a hiring freeze. In 2010, Stony Brook University was sued by students after Stanley illegally closed down programs at the Stony Brook Southampton campus; a settlement was reached mandating Stanley personally apologize to the students affected by his action. Under Stanley's tenure, Stony Brook University saw its largest donation in school history and the largest donation in State University of New York history when mathematician Jim Simons gifted $150 million to the school. In 2012, Stanley and his wife announced the establishment of the Ellen Li and Samuel S. Stanley Jr. Endowed Scholarship in the Stony Brook University School of Medicine. In January 2015, Stanley began his term on the NCAA Division I board of directors. On July 19, 2016, Stanley was appointed to the NCAA board of governors. While serving on the NCAA board of governors, Stanley helped kill a bill proposing a comprehensive misconduct questionnaire for student- athletes accused of criminal, civil or juvenile offenses. During the 2014‚Äì15 school year, Stanley's salary of $690,040 was the 25th-highest amongst public university executives in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The report also discovered that from 2009 to 2012, Stanley was given an additional $250,000 from the Stony Brook Foundation which was not calculated in his compensation. With Stanley at the helm, Stony Brook's budget deficit grew to $35 million by 2017. Rumors of cuts to humanities programs led to a large student protest on May 10, 2017, as well as blowback from faculty. On June 22, 2017, Stanley officially suspended student admissions into its theater arts, comparative literature and cinema arts departments, and consolidated several language disciplines. In December 2017, a group of 42 distinguished Stony Brook professors wrote a letter to State University of New York Chancellor Kristina M. Johnson with concerns that Stanley and his administration was \\"failing the institution\\". A 2019 report by The Atlantic claimed that Stanley and his administrators repeatedly intimidated journalists, including those from the university newspaper The Statesman, for writing articles that appeared to negatively portray Stanley. = President of Michigan State University = Stanley was named president of Michigan State University on May 28, 2019, to succeed Lou Anna Simon, who resigned in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal, with his tenure officially beginning on August 1. On August 29, 2019, two Michigan State students were charged with false terrorism threats after posting a plan to assassinate Stanley on the Michigan State subreddit. On September 6, 2019, Stanley was the target of a bomb threat towards Michigan State's administration building. =Biomedical research= Stanley was a biomedical researcher. His research interest in immunity from infections led him to publish several articles about the characterization of key proteins and pathways involved in amebic, bacterial and viral infections, blood-borne pathogen risks in hemophilia therapy, and the identification of new strain- specific clones.https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/12788669_Samuel_Stanley=all ResearchGate Profile: Samuel S. Stanley Better defense against infection was a key focus of his research. In 2008, he worked to create the Midwest Regional Center for Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research, with a $37 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. The center was established with goals of improving biodefense, in reaction to the post September 11 bioterrorism threats and anthrax attacks.http://mrce.wustl.edu/index.php?page=about=all About the MRCE He has also served on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, the NIH Blue Ribbon Panel on the New England Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory, the NIH National Advisory Allergy & Infectious Diseases Council and committees led by the United States Department of Commerce. Stanley is also the recipient of awards, including the Burrough's Welcome Scholar Award in Molecular Parasitology and the Distinguished Service Teaching Award from Washington University. Stanley is currently the owner of 3 patents. He also serves as an ambassador for the Paul G. Rogers Society for Global Health Research and has received an honorary doctorate degree in Science from Konkuk University in South Korea.

It is a common parasite in the skin of humans in the rain forests of Africa, where it is thought to be a parasite of chimpanzees, as well.foundations of parasitology, 8th ed, p 473-474... from Meyers, 2000, in Hunter's tropical medicine and emerging infectious disease 8th ed. Mansonella streptocerca is one of three filarial nematodes that cause subcutaneous filariasis in humans. The other two filarial nematodes are Loa loa (the African eye worm), and Onchocerca volvulus (river blindness). The worm is distributed across West and Central Africa. Life cycle 350px The contraction of an M. streptocerca infection can be better understood through an understanding of its life cycle. The life cycle involves two stages: one involving a midge (genus Culicoides) and another involving a human host. First, a midge ingests a blood meal from a human host. This allows third-stage filarial larvae to enter the bite wound. Once inside the dermis, the larvae develop into adults, usually less than 1 mm from the surface of the skin. In terms of size, the females can reach 27 mm in length, whereas the males can be around 50 Œºm in diameter. These adults then produce nonperiodic microfiliariae, which habitate in the skin, but can also travel to the peripheral blood. These microfilariae are then passed onto the midge when the insect ingests a blood meal. Following the blood meal, microfilariae travel to the midge‚Äôs midgut through the hemocoel to the thoracic muscles. In the thoracic muscles, the microfiliariae develop into first-stage larvae, followed up by third-stage development. In this latter stage, the larvae travel to the midge‚Äôs proboscis, where it can subsequently infect another human host upon another blood meal ingestion. http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/DPDx/HTML/Frames/A-F/Filariasis/body_Filariasis_m_streptocerca.htm Prevalence M. streptocerca has reportedly been found in West and Central Africa including Western Uganda, the Uganda-Zaire border, and the Bundibugyo district. Morphology The adult form of M. streptocerca was discovered by Dr. Wayne M Meyers while working as a medical missionary in Africa. M. streptocerca adults have a unique posterior end that is bent, resembling the shape of a shepherd‚Äôs crook. This feature makes it possible for laboratory workers to distinguish M. streptocerca from other species of roundworms. Diagnosis The infection of these roundworms typically causes no symptoms but may sometimes cause a mild dermatitis of the thorax and shoulders. M. streptocerca infections fortunately do not cause any nodules, skin disease, or ocular infections like that of Onchocerca volvulus. Due to the absence of nodules, differentiating between M. streptocerca and O. volvulvus infections are easier to diagnose. Treatment Treatment of streptocerciasis includes the use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) which is reportedly effective against the microfilarial and adult stage M. streptocerca, but not proven as a method of treatment. A common drug used to treat roundworms, Ivermectin, is not proven to serve as a treatment for streptocerciasis although it is shown that ivermectin should not be used as a mass treatment in endemic areas where only M. streptocerca is found. This is because the side effects of the drug commonly outweigh the consequences of the infection. Prevention Take preventative measures by using DEET or other insect repellents to ward off midges when traveling into endemic areas.

They were both built around 1860 as part of Rosedale, the estate of Isaac Roosevelt, grandfather of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's son John, who inherited the estate, was a champion ice yachter. He stored his craft in the boathouse, and his crews would warm up in the cottage. In 1993 both properties were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a single listing. Property The boathouse and cottage are located in a five-acre (2 ha) parcel between the tracks built as the Hudson River Railroad (now used by CSX and Amtrak's Empire Service) and the river itself. The Hyde Park Marina is located to the south. Most of the land is unpaved and open; truck trailers from a business to the north are stored around the property. The cottage is visible from where River Point Road crosses the tracks. It is a one-and-a-half-story frame house on a stone and brick foundation with board-and-batten siding, three bays wide at the front. Its steeply pitched gabled roof is shingled in asphalt, pierced by a central brick chimney and finials and cross-gabled in the west (rear) elevation. Scalloped vergeboards decorate the gable ends, and the cornice is similarly trimmed. The centrally located front entrance, on the eastern facade, has a bracketed pent roof, and a wooden hood covers both windows, each flanked by louvered shutters. Inside much of the original finishing remains, such as the flooring, doors and woodwork. The boathouse is a long frame building located to the north. It is sided in board-and-batten as well with a stone course at ground level on its northern elevation. It has a double- pitched slate roof with an open area in between to allow for ventilation. A metal vent pipe rises from the roof ridge at the south, with additional pipes coming out of the western wall. Inside, the boathouse has been slightly renovated for use as an office, which required some new braces for the rafters. Besides that and the removal of the loft, the building remains intact. History The cottage was built by 1860 to house tenants on the Rosedale estate. Records show that it was home to Rosedale's gardener later on, when Isaac's son John Aspinwall Roosevelt owned the property. He was an avid sportsman, and in the 1880s was a champion ice yachter at a time when the Hudson just north of Poughkeepsie and the river's salt front, where it freezes over in cold winters, was the center of the sport in the United States. The boathouse was specially built to accommodate his yacht, the Icicle, now on display at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, also in Hyde Park. The boathouse's double-pitched roof recalls the gambrel roofs found on many Dutch Colonial homes in the area. Sails were stored in the loft, no longer extant. John Roosevelt's crews would warm up between and after races in the cottage's front room. His nephew Franklin spent much time at Rosedale as a boy, and as a young man competed in ice races himself, storing his own yacht in the boathouse. The estate remained in the Roosevelt family's hands until the mid-1950s, when it was subdivided to create the suburban-style residential neighborhood to the south of River Point Road. The main house, boathouse and cottage are the only remaining buildings from Rosedale.

Part I Essays in In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens Part I: * \\"Saving the Life That Is Your Own: The Importance of Models in the Artist's Life\\" * \\"The Black Writer and the Southern Experience\\" * \\"But Yet and Still the Cotton Gin Kept on Working‚Ä¶\\" * \\"A Talk: Convocation 1972\\" * \\"Beyond the Peacock: The Reconstruction of Flannery O'Connor\\" * \\"The Divided Life of Jean Toomer\\" * \\"A Writer Because of, Not in Spite of, Her Children\\" * \\"Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson\\" * \\"Zora Neale Hurston: A Cautionary Tale and a Partisan View\\" * \\"Looking for Zora\\" * \\"Bash the Whites\\" Within these essays, She speaks about her search for early black writers such as Rebecca Jackson. She speaks of unsung heroines whom she has come into contact with who wish to tell their stories; for example Mrs. Winson Hudson. Hudson, the director of a Headstart center, wished to tell her story so that people would know \\"the agitation she caused in her community‚Ä¶was not for herself or for any one group but for everybody in the county\\".Walker (1983), p. 25. However, of all the writers she introduces, Zora Neale Hurston becomes a focal part in this section of essays. As Walker begins to research the practice of voodoo by rural Southern blacks in the thirties, she becomes aware of Hurston's works. Other than white anthropologists with racist views, Walker finds no one other than Hurston studied voodoo extensively. Hurston's book Mules and Men, a collection of folklore, sparks Walker's interest immediately because it provides all the stories that Southern blacks \\"had forgotten or of which they had grown ashamed‚Ä¶and showed how marvelous, and, indeed, priceless, they are\\".Walker (1983), p. 85. In her essay, \\"Looking for Zora,\\" Walker speaks about her trip to Hurston's hometown of Eatonville, FL to discover the life of her ancestral teacher. Despite Hurston's notoriety, when she passed in 1959, she was buried in an \\"unmarked grave in a segregated cemetery\\".Walker (1983), p. 93. When Walker arrives in Florida, she purchases a tombstone that reads: \\"Zora Neale Hurston 'A Genius of the South' Novelist, Folklorist, Anthropologist 1901-1960\\". The line \\"a genius of the South\\" comes from a poem by Jean Toomer, whom Walker applauds for his \\"sensitivity to women and his ultimate condescension toward them\\".Walker (1983), pp. 61-2. Walker's exploration for the black writers of the past connects to her search for the kind of books that are underrepresented in American literature. She confirms this based on her referral to a comment by Toni Morrison: When Toni Morrison said she writes the kind of books she wants to read, she was acknowledging the fact that in a society in which 'accepted literature' is so often sexist and racist and otherwise irrelevant or offensive to so many lives, she must do the work of two. She said she must be her own model as well as the artist attending, creating, learning from, realizing the model, which is to say, herself.Walker (1983), p. 8. Walker's search for 'models' is an attempt to \\"capture the voices\\" of writers who are often overlooked and/or forgotten such as Zora Neale Hurston.  Part II  In Part II of In Search of Our Mother's Gardens Alice Walker focuses on the Civil Rights Movement and the important leaders who made contributions to it. Through these essays, she also exemplifies how important the Civil Rights Movements' aims were for African Americans. Part Two includes the following essays: *\\"The Civil Rights Movement: What Good Was it?\\" *\\"The Unglamorous but Worthwhile Duties of the Black Revolutionary Artist, or of the Black Writer Who Simply Works and Writes\\" *\\"My Father's Country is Poor\\" *\\"Making the Moves and the Movies We Want\\" *\\"Good Morning, Revolution:Uncollected Writings of Social Protest\\" *\\"Choice: A tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\" *\\"Coretta King: Revisted\\" *\\"Choosing to Stay at Home: Ten Years after the March on Washington\\" *\\"Lulls\\" *\\"Recording the Season\\" *\\"The Almost Year\\" In many of these essays Walker describes her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and explores the positives and negatives of the Civil Rights Movement's purpose. At the time of Civil Rights, Walker comprehends that she needs to make a change. She commences to take action by visiting several homes and handing out registration ballots so the privileged and underprivileged could vote. She met a Jewish law student named Mel Leventhal, who gave her inspiration to write \\"The Civil Rights Movement: What Good Was it?.\\" Many people believed that Civil Rights Movement was dead. Alice Walker points out that if it is dead, she will explain why she believes that it is not. For many African Americans, the Civil Rights Movement gave them a sense of hope and freedom. She shows that whites would see the Civil Rights Movement as being dead because they did not have to go through the struggles and sacrifices that African-Americans had to encounter. They did not have to show interest because this movement was intended to help African-Americans to be equal and get the same rights as white people. White people already had the rights that the law granted and African Americans were still fighting for it. Besides that she points out that other ethnicities were unable to understand the significance behind the Civil Rights Movement and its importance for African Americans. Of the Civil Rights Movement, Walker says, \\"It gave us history and men far greater than presidents. It gave us heroes. Selfless men of courage and strength, for our little boys and girls to follow. It gave us hope for tomorrow. It called us to life. Because we live, it can never die\\".Walker (1983), p. 128. \\"Choice: A Tribute to Dr. Luther King Jr.\\" emphasizes how much passion and respect Walker has for Dr. King. In this particular essay, she speaks from a restaurant that refused to serve African Americans in 1972. Walker is able to learn from Dr. King's experience because as an African American, she had to endure those same struggles. Walker's mother taught her and her siblings to embrace their culture but at the same time to move up north to escape the harsh realities of the South. Walker and her mother were present for Dr. King's infamous speech. Ultimately, this changes Walker's perspective on racism and the effects of the Civil Rights Movement within the African-American community. Dr. King's example greatly inspires Walker's viewpoint of how she sees the South. The backlash of racial tension between blacks and whites were extreme. Dr. King was seen as a savior for the African-American community. Walker recalls, \\"He gave us continuity of place, without which community is ephemeral. He gave us home\\".Walker (1983), p. 145. Due to her great admiration for Dr. King, she returns to the South to empower African-American communities. In \\"The Almost Year\\", Alice Walker explains how the author Florence Randall explains how she wants blacks and whites to embrace one another. She clarifies that \\"she seeks to find a way in which black abused and poor and white privileged and rich can meet and exchange some warmth of themselves.Walker (1983), p. 139. Walker's perspective is that if both blacks and whites can stop the racial equality that blacks and whites will not be divided. In this house, a black girl feels somewhat threatened being an all-white household. Due to these circumstances, Walker provides a sense of division between the black girl and the family that is providing a home for her to feel free. The black girl cannot embrace the warmth from the Mallory's family because she feels that all white people are to hurt black people. Walker explains how the Civil Rights Movement intended to bring both blacks and whites together. Walker wants to show how a black girl should not have to feel unequal when they are around white people. Moreover, in \\"Coretta King: Revisited,\\" Alice Walker describes an interview with Coretta Scott King. Walker presents her as more than a mother and wife; she is similar to her husband, and is making a conscientious effort to fight for equality and civil liberties for African Americans. Walker sees strength in Coretta Scott King, a woman who just lost her husband due to the acts of violence from others. Walker finds it difficult to understand how a woman who just lost a loved one to the brutality, could continue in the battle for Civil Rights. Walker praises the fact that Coretta Scott King did not just sit back but took actions to help with different campaigns. Walker converses with her on about \\"black people in power and the whites who work with them\\"Walker (1983), p. 154. and Ms. King says, \\"I don't believe that black people are going to misuse power in the way it has been misused. I think they've learned from their experiences. And we've seen instances where black and white work together effectively\\".Walker (1983), p. 155.  Part III  Part Three of In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens includes the following essays: *\\"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens\\" *\\"From an Interview\\" *\\"A Letter to the Editor of Ms.\\" *\\"Breaking Chains and Encouraging Life\\" *\\"If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?\\" *\\"Looking to the Side, and Back\\" *\\"To The Black Scholar\\" *\\"Brothers and Sisters\\" Part three addresses black women coping with self-worth and self-respect. It offers encouragement to future generations of Black men and women. Walker begins part III with a poem by Marilou Awiakta, \\"Motheroot.\\" In this section of the collection Walker is on a mental journey seeking ways to uplift the Black race. Along this exploration she uses literature of other Black poets and writers to gain a deeper insight on Black women in their era, which assisted Walker in understanding society in her era. In the opening of \\"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens\\", Walker quotes from Jean Toomer's Cane, taking note that in early literature by black men, black women were seen has hopeless and characterized as mere sex objects. \\"I asked her to hope, and build up an inner life against the coming of that day‚Ä¶I sang, with a strange quiver in my voice, a promise song.\\"Walker (1983), p. 213. The focus of this essay is on that of the Black women throughout history who have created masterpieces from the scraps they were afforded. Black women's potential for creative freedom is stifled by their position in society that places a series of tropes and caricatures onto their being, operating to delegitimize the work they produce. Walker says black women did not have the opportunity to pursue their dreams because they were given the main responsibility of raising children, obeying their husbands, and maintaining the household: \\"Or was she required to bake biscuits for a lazy backwater tramp, when she cried out in her soul to paint watercolors of sunsets, or the rain falling on the green and peaceful pasturelands? Or was her body broken and forced to bear children.\\"Walker (1983), p. 233. Walker personalizes these women by referring to them as \\"our mothers and grandmothers\\".Walker (1983), p. 232. Toomer felt that black women were unhappy and felt unloved. Both Walker and Toomer felt that black women were not allowed to dream, yet alone pursue them. \\"They were Creators, who lived lives of spiritual waste, because they were so rich in spirituality, which is the basis of art, that the strain of enduring their unused and unwanted talent drove them insane\\". Walker proceeds in saying how oppression has caused many talented black women to go unnoticed or unheard of. Walker cites Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Roberta Flack, and Aretha Franklin to note talent lost among the black race and culture. Additionally, Walker refers to Virginia Woolf's, A Room of One's Own and writer Phillis Wheatley; Walker compares both artists conveying that all of Woolf's fears were Wheatley's reality; due to restraints all of Woolf's goals were unachievable for Wheatley. Woolf writes, \\"any woman born with a great gift in the sixteenth century would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at. For it needs little skill and psychology to be sure that a highly gifted girl who had tried to use her gift for poetry would have been so thwarted and hindered by contrary instincts, that she must have lost her health and sanity to a certainty.\\" Wheatley experienced everything Woolf dreaded, although Wheatley was granted limited freedom of expression and education by her owners. Walker focuses on the phrase, \\"contrary instincts\\"Walker (1983), p. 235. used by Woolf, believing that this what Wheatley felt since she was taught that her origin was an untamed and inadequate culture and race. In Wheatley's poetry she describes a \\"goddess\\",Walker (1983), p. 236. which Walker perceives as her owner, whom Wheatley appreciates although she was enslaved by this person. Walker pays tribute to Wheatley when she writes, \\"But at last Phillis, we understand. No more snickering when your stiff, struggling, ambivalent lines are forced on us. We know now that you were not an idiot or a traitor\\".Walker (1983), p. 237. According to Walker, society viewed Black women as, \\"the mule of the world\\", this caused black women to become emotionless and hopeless. Further, in the essay Walker gives a personal account of her own mother, \\"And yet, it is to my mother-and all our mothers who were not famous-that I went in search of the secret if what has fed that muzzled and often mutilated, but vibrant, creative spirit that the black woman has inherited, and that pops out in wild and unlikely places to this day\\".Walker (1983), p. 238. Walker describes her mother's simple, but appreciated talent of gardening. For Walker, her mother's ability to continue gardening despite her poor living conditions portrays her mother's strong persona and ability to strive even in hardship. \\"She spent the summers canning vegetables and fruits. She spent the winter evenings making quilts enough to cover all our beds. There was a never a moment for her to sit down, undisturbed, to unravel her own private thoughts; never a time free from interruption-by work or the noisy inquiries of children. The theme and idea of legacy reoccurs towards the end of the essay. Walker describes, the legacy of her mother, \\"Her face, as she prepares the Art that is her gift is a legacy of respect she leaves to me, for all that illuminates and cherishes life\\". Walker reveals how she has found and understood herself, while researching her heritage. \\"From An Interview\\" gives readers a deeper insight on Walker's personal struggle with self-worth. Walker extensively reveals her inner conflicts and the imperative events in her life that has made her the person she is. Walker refers to herself as a \\"solitary\\"Walker (1983), p. 244. person from as early as her childhood. Walker was discloses that she was teased as a child due to her disfigurement, which made her feel worthless and later on as a college student she began to seriously contemplate suicide. Walker says, \\"That year I made myself acquainted with every philosopher's position on suicide, because by that time it did not seem frightening or even odd, but only inevitable\\".Walker (1983), p. 245. Walker also began to lose her faith in a higher being because she felt as though her thoughts of suicide disappointed God, therefore weakening her relationship with him. Walker explains that with the help of friends and poetry she unraveled herself from this path of self- destruction. According to Walker her main release of energy is through poetry. Walker then explains her passion for poetry, \\"Since that time, it seems to me that all of my poems-and I write groups of poems rather than singles-are written when I have successfully pulled myself out of a completely numbing despair, and stand again in the sunlight. Writing poems is my way of celebrating with the world that I have not committed suicide the night before\\".Walker (1983), p. 229. Walker expresses that with her experiences she has developed a passion to help Black women who lack the self-esteem as she once did. \\"If the Present Looks Like the Past, What Does the Future Look Like?\\" addresses the divide within the black community. In the opening of the essay Walker bluntly begins with the division among lighter and darker skinned black women. Walker speaks about how lighter women unintentionally and unknowingly offend dark skinned women when she says, \\"What black women would be interested in, I think, is a consciously heightened awareness on the part of light black women that they are capable, often quite unconsciously, of inflicting pain upon them; and that unless the question of Colorism‚Äì in my definition, prejudicial or preferential treatment of same-race people based solely on their color‚Äì is addressed in our communities and definitely in our black \\"sisterhoods\\" we cannot, as a people, progress. For colorism, like colonialism, sexism, and racism, impedes us\\".Walker (1983), p. 291. Walker encourages the two groups to be sensitive towards one another, or else progression of Black people will be haunted. Walker urges Black people to pave the way for future generations to eliminate the distress experienced by her and many others. Walker expresses this thought when she says, \\"‚Ä¶I believe in listening-to a person, the sea, the wind, the trees, but especially to young black women whose rocky road I am still traveling\\".Walker (1983), p. 272.

Composite fermions were originally envisioned in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect, but subsequently took on a life of their own, exhibiting many other consequences and phenomena. Vortices are an example of topological defect, and also occur in other situations. Quantized vortices are found in type II superconductors, called Abrikosov vortices. Classical vortices are relevant to the Berezenskii‚ÄìKosterlitz‚ÄìThouless transition in two-dimensional XY model.  Description  When electrons are confined to two dimensions, cooled to very low temperatures, and subjected to a strong magnetic field, their kinetic energy is quenched due to Landau level quantization. Their behavior under such conditions is governed by the Coulomb repulsion alone, and they produce a strongly correlated quantum liquid. Experiments have shown that electrons minimize their interaction by capturing quantized vortices to become composite fermions. The interaction between composite fermions themselves is often negligible to a good approximation, which makes them the physical quasiparticles of this quantum liquid. The signature quality of composite fermions, which is responsible for the otherwise unexpected behavior of this system, is that they experience a much smaller magnetic field than electrons. The magnetic field seen by composite fermions is given by : B^*=B-2p \\\\rho \\\\phi_0, where B is the external magnetic field, 2p is the number of vortices bound to composite fermion (also called the vorticity or the vortex charge of the composite fermion), \\\\rho is the particle density in two dimensions, and \\\\phi_0=hc/e is called the ‚Äúflux quantum‚Äù (which differs from the superconducting flux quantum by a factor of two). The effective magnetic field is a direct manifestation of the existence of composite fermions, and also embodies a fundamental distinction between electrons and composite fermions. Sometimes it is said that electrons \\"swallow\\" 2p flux quanta each to transform into composite fermions, and the composite fermions then experience the residual magnetic field B^*. More accurately, the vortices bound to electrons produce their own geometric phases which partly cancel the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm phase due to the external magnetic field to generate a net geometric phase that can be modeled as an Aharonov‚ÄìBohm phase in an effective magnetic field B^*. The behavior of composite fermions is similar to that of electrons in an effective magnetic field B^*. Electrons form Landau levels in a magnetic field, and the number of filled Landau levels is called the filling factor, given by the expression u=\\\\rho \\\\phi_0/B. Composite fermions form Landau-like levels in the effective magnetic field B^*, which are called composite fermion Landau levels or \\\\Lambda levels. One defines the filling factor for composite fermions as u^*=\\\\rho \\\\phi_0/B^*. This gives the following relation between the electron and composite fermion filling factors : u=\\\\frac{ u^*}{2p u^*\\\\pm 1}. The minus sign occurs when the effective magnetic field is antiparallel to the applied magnetic field, which happens when the geometric phase from the vortices overcompensate the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm phase.  Experimental manifestations  The central statement of composite fermion theory is that the strongly correlated electrons at a magnetic field B (or filling factor u) turn into weakly interacting composite fermions at a magnetic field B^* (or composite fermion filling factor u^*). This allows an effectively single-particle explanation of the otherwise complex many-body behavior, with the interaction between electrons manifesting as an effective kinetic energy of composite fermions. Here are some of the phenomena arising from composite fermions: = Fermi sea = The effective magnetic field for composite fermions vanishes for B=2p\\\\rho\\\\phi_0, where the filling factor for electrons is u=1/2p. Here, composite fermions make a Fermi sea. This Fermi sea has been observed at half filled Landau level in a number of experiments, which also measure the Fermi wave vector. = Cyclotron orbits = As the magnetic field is moved slightly away from B^*=0, composite fermions execute semiclassical cyclotron orbits. These have been observed by coupling to surface acoustic waves, resonance peaks in antidot superlattice, and magnetic focusing. The radius of the cyclotron orbits is consistent with the effective magnetic field B^*=0 and is sometimes an order of magnitude or more larger than the radius of the cyclotron orbit of an electron at the externally applied magnetic field B. Also, the observed direction of trajectory is opposite to that of electrons when B^* is anti-parallel to B. = Cyclotron resonance = In addition to the cyclotron orbits, cyclotron resonance of composite fermions has also been observed by photoluminescence. = Shubnikov de Haas oscillations = As the magnetic field is moved further away from B^*=0, quantum oscillations are observed that are periodic in 1/B^*. These are Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas oscillations of composite fermions. These oscillations arise from the quantization of the semiclassical cyclotron orbits of composite fermions into composite fermion Landau levels. From the analysis of the Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas experiments, one can deduce the effective mass and the quantum lifetime of composite fermions. = Integer quantum Hall effect = With further increase in B^* or decrease in temperature and disorder, composite fermions exhibit integer quantum Hall effect. The integer fillings of composite fermions, u^*=n, correspond to the electrons fillings : u=\\\\frac{n}{2pn\\\\pm 1}. Combined with : u=1-\\\\frac{n}{2pn\\\\pm 1}, which are obtained by attaching vortices to holes in the lowest Landau level, these constitute the prominently observed sequences of fractions. Examples are :{n\\\\over 2n+1}={1\\\\over 3},\\\\, {2\\\\over 5},\\\\, {3\\\\over 7},\\\\, {4\\\\over 9},\\\\,{5\\\\over 11},\\\\cdots :{n\\\\over 2n-1}={2\\\\over 3},\\\\, {3\\\\over 5},\\\\, {4\\\\over 7},\\\\, {5\\\\over 9},\\\\,{6\\\\over 11},\\\\cdots :{n\\\\over 4n+1}={1\\\\over 5},\\\\, {2\\\\over 9},\\\\, {3\\\\over 13},\\\\, {4\\\\over 17},\\\\cdots The fractional quantum Hall effect of electrons is thus explained as the integer quantum Hall effect of composite fermions. It results in fractionally quantized Hall plateaus at : R_H={h\\\\over u e^2}, with u given by above quantized values. These sequences terminate at the composite fermion Fermi sea. Note that the fractions have odd denominators, which follows from the even vorticity of composite fermions. = Fractional quantum Hall effect = The above sequences account for most, but not all, observed fractions. Other fractions have been observed, which arise from a weak residual interaction between composite fermions, and are thus more delicate. A number of these are understood as fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions. For example, the fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions at u^*=4/3 produces the fraction 4/11, which does not belong to the primary sequences. = Superconductivity = An even denominator fraction, u=5/2, has been observed. Here the second Landau level is half full, but the state cannot be a Fermi sea of composite fermions, because the Fermi sea is gapless and does not show quantum Hall effect. This state is viewed as a \\"superconductor\\" of composite fermion, arising from a weak attractive interaction between composite fermions at this filling factor. The pairing of composite fermions opens a gap and produces a fractional quantum Hall effect. = Excitons = The neutral excitations of various fractional quantum Hall states are excitons of composite fermions, that is, particle hole pairs of composite fermions. The energy dispersion of these excitons has been measured by light scattering and phonon scattering. = Spin = At high magnetic fields the spin of composite fermions is frozen, but it is observable at relatively low magnetic fields. The fan diagram of the composite fermion Landau levels has been determined by transport, and shows both spin-up and spin-down composite fermion Landau levels. The fractional quantum Hall states as well as composite fermion Fermi sea are also partially spin polarized for relatively low magnetic fields. = Effective magnetic field = The effective magnetic field of composite fermions has been confirmed by the similarity of the fractional and the integer quantum Hall effects, observation of Fermi sea at half filled Landau level, and measurements of the cyclotron radius. = Mass = The mass of composite fermions has been determined from the measurements of: the effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions; the temperature dependence of Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas oscillations; energy of the cyclotron resonance; spin polarization of the Fermi sea; and quantum phase transitions between states with different spin polarizations. Its typical value in GaAs systems is on the order of the electron mass in vacuum. (It is unrelated to the electron band mass in GaAs, which is 0.07 of the electron mass in vacuum.)  Theoretical formulations  Much of the experimental phenomenology can be understood from the qualitative picture of composite fermions in an effective magnetic field. In addition, composite fermions also lead to a detailed and accurate microscopic theory of this quantum liquid. Two approaches have proved useful. = Trial wave functions = The following trial wave functions embody the composite fermion physics: \\\\Psi^{\\\\rm FQHE}_{ u}=P\\\\;\\\\; \\\\Psi^{\\\\rm IQHE}_{ u^*} \\\\prod_{1\\\\leq j Here \\\\Psi^{\\\\rm FQHE}_{ u} is the wave function of interacting electrons at filling factor u; \\\\Psi^{\\\\rm IQHE}_{ u^*} is the wave function for weakly interacting electrons at u^*; N is the number of electrons or composite fermions; z_j=x_j+iy_j is the coordinate of the jth particle; and P is an operator that projects the wave function into the lowest Landau level. This provides an explicit mapping between the integer and the fractional quantum Hall effects. Multiplication by \\\\prod_{j attaches 2p vortices to each electron to convert it into a composite fermion. The right hand side is thus interpreted as describing composite fermions at filling factor u^*. The above mapping gives wave functions for both the ground and excited states of the fractional quantum Hall states in terms of the corresponding known wave functions for the integral quantum Hall states. The latter do not contain any adjustable parameters for u^*=n, so the FQHE wave functions do not contain any adjustable parameters at u=n/(2pn\\\\pm 1) . Comparisons with exact results show that these wave functions are quantitatively accurate. They can be used to compute a number of measurable quantities, such as the excitation gaps and exciton dispersions, the phase diagram of composite fermions with spin, the composite fermion mass, etc. For u^*=1 they reduce to the Laughlin wavefunction at fillings u=1/(2p+1). = Chern‚ÄìSimons field theory = Another formulation of the composite fermion physics is through a Chern‚ÄìSimons field theory, wherein flux quanta are attached to electrons by a singular gauge transformation. At the mean field approximation the physics of free fermions in an effective field is recovered. Perturbation theory at the level of the random phase approximation captures many of the properties of composite fermions.

Unlike his crime novels penned under the name John Godey, Morton Freedgood wrote this novel under his own name having worked for years in the publicity departments at several movie companies. The novel's name has a double meaning. It is a play on wall-to-wall carpeting, signifying one of the many modern luxuries enjoyed by the main character, a high-paid publicity executive, who feels trapped in his position at a movie production company. Plot Ted is a publicity department executive at the Manhattan office of Above All Pictures, a movie production company in the mid-1950s. His high salary affords him a nice car and furnishes his large apartment, where he lives with his wife, Roxy, and their two children. Although Ted has experience in the specious marketing game played between publicists, actors, directors, producers, and tabloid journalists, he feels trapped in office politics after a rumor is started that he is about to be fired by his new boss, Larry. Larry takes the Machiavellian approach to management, even convincing Ted to shed crocodile tears over his potentially destitute family during a business dinner with a magazine editor. Ted hopes to secure a headlining article to back up a publicity stunt for Above All's latest movie. Without the article, Ted's stunt will backfire, the movie may flop, and Ted is certain to be fired. Ted's former boss, Willie ‚Äì who had left Above All to be a television executive in Chicago, Illinois ‚Äì had a more lenient management approach. Willie is virtually blind to incompetence and seeks unconditional loyalty. He surrounds himself with yes men and rewards those that let Willie all but run their lives for them. Ted perceives it as security through fealty. Before Ted leaves Above All for Chicago, he and Willie have a falling-out. Ted now strives to prove himself to Larry and the other executives at Above All, to thwart the rumor of his imminent firing.

The building, which dates from 1766 in its original incarnation as the ballroom of Brighton's most fashionable Georgian-era inn, has been used for many purposes since then, and now stands away from where it was built. It spent less than 90 years as an Anglican church, and is now used as a centre for homeless people. In view of its architectural and historical importance, it has been listed at Grade II* by English Heritage. History Brighton began to develop as a spa town and seaside resort in the mid-18th century, encouraged by local doctor Richard Russell's influential advocacy of the therapeutic use of seawater, by drinking it and bathing in it. Reference throughout text. Reference throughout text. These activities became fashionable among high society and rich people, which gave the declining fishing village a surge of popularity in the 1750s. The Steine (now Old Steine), an area of flat, grassy, sheltered land behind the seafront, developed as the growing town's promenade, where visitors would walk and socialise. The surrounding area soon became built up, and in 1752 innkeeper Samuel Shergold bought a recently built house on the southwest side of The Steine and converted it into a tavern with assembly rooms. The venue, called the Castle Inn or Castle Tavern, became increasingly popular, and in 1766 John Crunden designed an extension on the north side of the inn. This housed a 450-capacity, ballroom. For the next half-century it was one of the most popular social venues in the town, rivalled only by the Old Ship Inn and assembly rooms (whose owner cooperated with Shergold to provide a regular programme of alternating social events). Contemporary accounts described the Castle Inn's ballroom and assembly rooms as some of the best and most architecturally impressive in England. Decline set in during the early 19th century, and the assembly room's first summer-season closure occurred in 1815. Crunden's ballroom was closed the previous year. In 1815, Shergold offered a 25% share in the building and its land, and the Prince Regent (later King George IV) bought it through an intermediary, Thomas Attree, for ¬£1,960 (¬£ in ). He acquired another 25% share in 1816 and the remaining 50% in 1822, and the inn closed to the public soon afterwards and was demolished in stages between 1819 and October 1823. The ballroom was converted into the recently completed Royal Pavilion's private chapel for the Prince Regent‚Äîwho by this time was King‚Äîand was consecrated on 1 January 1822 by the Bishop of Chichester. He had moved into the Pavilion the previous year. In its new guise, the chapel had over 400 seats and admission was by invitation only. Designer William Tuppen was responsible for the interior refit, which included the conversion of the musicians' gallery into the King's own pew and the installation of an organ supported by Gothic-style columns. The Royal Pavilion was unpopular with Queen Victoria, whose reign began in 1837. Her last visit was in 1845; soon afterwards the Government wanted to demolish the building and sell the land to pay for building work at Buckingham Palace. This proposal was unpopular in the town, and in May 1850 the Town Commissioners received consent to buy the site, including the chapel. It became the property of Brighton Corporation (the forerunners of the present-day Council) in 1855. Because the chapel had been consecrated for Anglican worship, the Church Commissioners claimed it on behalf of the Diocese of Chichester. Instead of leaving the building on the same site, the Diocese decided to demolish it and re-erect it brick by brick on a site away, at Montpelier Place near the boundary with Hove. Because the Diocese's claim on the church was upheld, the Town Commissioners reduced their payment to the Government for the Pavilion estate by ¬£3,000 (¬£ in ). The land at Montpelier Place was transferred free of charge to the Diocese by the Vicar of Brighton's sister. The interior of the chapel was only minimally altered by the move and reconstruction, which was completed in 1851. It was given a new stuccoed fa√ßade in the Classical style, however. The church was opened for public worship under its new name, St Stephen's, on 25 July 1851, and was consecrated on 11 June 1852 by the Bishop of Chichester, Ashurst Turner Gilbert. The Vicar of Brighton's nephew George Wagner became its first vicar; he was an adherent of the mid-19th century idea that Gothic architecture was the only appropriate design for Anglican churches, and regarded the Classical building as \\"pre-eminently ugly\\". The church could hold more than 700 worshippers, and approximately one-quarter of the pews were free (not subject to pew rents). It attracted a mostly poor congregation. Some internal changes were made over the next 90 years, but Rev. Charles Douglas's plans for a new Byzantine-style church on the site, announced in the 1860s, were not realised. A porch and vestry were built in 1868, and new lectern, altar rails, organ and pulpits were put in. Arthur Blomfield carried out further renovation work in 1889. In the 1930s the church became associated with The Anglican Diocese of Chichester's Healing Ministry, under the leadership of the Revd. John Maillard, and it was closed in 1939 and converted into the Diocese of Chichester's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. In 1974, this moved to a building next to the former St John the Evangelist's Church on Carlton Hill. In 1988, a local housing association acquired the building and converted it into the First Base Day Centre for homeless people. Crunden's interior, which had survived largely intact since he built the ballroom in 1766, was damaged by fire soon after the day centre opened, but it has been restored. Architecture John Crunden designed the Castle Inn ballroom in the Adam style, which is still discernible in the interior despite the many changes of use the building has experienced. The internal walls had elaborate pilasters decorated with scrolls and friezes, and at the north and south ends there were recessed areas separated from the main section by columns. Between the pilasters were a series of wall paintings. When the building was re-erected at Montpelier Place, galleries were added above the north and south recesses. In contrast to the Adamesque interior, the church was given a plain stuccoed Classical frontage facing Montpelier Place, with Doric pilasters below a pediment and cornice, topped by a lantern. The east and west faces have arched windows. Local architect George Cheeseman was responsible for this work. The porch, a later addition, has three bays with arched windows in the outer pair and the entrance door in the centre. The building today St Stephen's Church was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 13 October 1952. This status is given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The First Base Day Centre, as the building is now known, is run by Brighton Housing Trust. It was established in the 1960s and now has several sites in the city. About 100 people use the centre daily. Since the trust acquired the building, it has made several internal alterations.

The siphuncle in Acanthonautilus is narrower than in Solenochilus and not as sinuous. As with Solenochilus, septal necks on the outer, or ventral, side are straight, but those on the inner, or dosal, side rather than being recumbent are simply curved, cytochoanitic. Most of the siphuncle is thin connecting ring which from the outside is slightly ventrally concave and slightly dorsally convex between septa.
