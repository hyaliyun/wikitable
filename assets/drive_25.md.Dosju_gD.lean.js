Sprague de Camp, based on the concept of human biological engineering . It was first published in the magazine Astounding Science-Fiction for December, 1938.Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, pages 210-211. It first appeared in book form in the collection The Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction (Shasta, 1949); it later appeared in the anthology Science Fiction of the Thirties (Bobbs-Merrill, 1975) and the collection The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, 1978). The story has been translated into German Plot summary Vernon Brock, an assistant aquarist at the New York City Aquarium, has, in addition to his normal duties, been studying the properties of gills and lungs, and devised a theoretical method of inducing the latter to assume the properties of the former. He believes the vapor given off by a mixture of \\"halogen-bearing organic compounds\\" would do the trick, and intends to experiment on its effect with alligators. Unfortunately, the flask containing the solution breaks, giving Brock himself a whiff of the vapor. Overcome, Brock falls into a shark tank. He quickly discovers that he can now \\"breathe\\" in water but not in air. There are difficulties: the higher density of water makes the breathing process slow and laborious, normal speech is rendered impossible, the liquid environment is too cold for his body, and he tires easily, since his lungs cannot extract as much oxygen from the water as his metabolism is used to. Soon Brock's colleagues gather above the tank. Knowing of his experiments, they realize what has happened and do their best to help him. He interacts with them initially by sign language and then by using a remora to scrawl a message on the glass of the tank. He requests two weighted stepladders and a weighted plank. Placing the plank across the ladders, he lies down atop it so that he is just beneath the surface of the water and by extending his hands into the air can communicate further by writing on a pad of paper. He is brought food and finds that with some care he can eat—though not meat, as the sharks quickly steal it. Instead he subsists on bananas. Meanwhile, a crowd of the public has gathered in front of the tank, including a little man who observes Brock with a \\"peculiar intentness\\" he finds disturbing. For Brock's comfort, the temperature is raised in the tank, more air lines are run in to increase the available oxygen, and the sharks are moved to a reserve tank. Nonetheless, he spends an uncomfortable night, unable to sleep \\"because of the constant muscular effort required to work his lungs.\\" His thoughts grow confused, and he becomes delusional. He also starts feeling that his lungs are not working right. In the morning, the little man returns, feeding his confusion and growing paranoia. Believing himself a fish and that the man wants to eat him, he attacks the glass with his pocket knife until it gives way and he and all the water spill out onto the concourse. Brock wakes up in the hospital, having been mercifully unconscious during the period in which his lungs finished returning to normal. While recovering well, he learns that the aquarium is facing a lawsuit from the little man, Oscar Daly, who nearly drowned when he let the water out of the tank. After his release, however, Brock comes to an arrangement with Daly that persuades the latter to drop his suit. Instead, Daly, a former circus acrobat, will use Brock's discovery to exhibit himself for money as Oscar the Merman. Reception In Astounding Science-Fiction magazine's reader's poll \\"The Analytical Laboratory\\", the story tied for first place as the most popular piece in the issue in which it was originally published,Campbell, John W. \\"The Analytical Laboratory: December 1938\\", in Astounding Science Fiction v. 22, no. 6, February 1939. \\"beating out competition as formidable as Lester del Rey's Helen O'Loy.\\"Moskowitz, Sam. \\"L.

New York: Ballantine Books, 1967, p. 160. Sam Moskowitz cited its publication as culminating a \\"brief period of but 15 months\\" in which de Camp \\"moved out into the front rank of science fiction writers.\\" Influence John J. Pierce saw the story as a forerunner to the introduction of the concept of genetic engineering in science fiction, later an important theme in the genre, but \\"almost unheard of\\" when \\"The Merman\\" was published.Pierce, John J. \\"Great Themes of Science Fiction: A Study in Imagination and Evolution. New York: Greenwood Press, 1987, p. 37. Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg have suggested de Camp's story as a possible influence on Bill Everett and Mort Weisinger in the creation of their golden age water-breathing comic book superheroes the Sub-Mariner and Aquaman.Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg. The Science of Superheroes. Hoboken, New Jersey, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., c2002, p. 52. Relation to other works While \\"The Merman\\" does not concern merpeople of the traditional mythical type, de Camp went on to write other tales that did, which tended to concentrate on the possibility of romantic entanglements between them and human beings. Chief among these is \\"Nothing in the Rules\\" (Unknown, July 1939), in which a lawyer helps a coach enter a mermaid in a swimming competition, only to fall in love with their protegé. A later story, \\"The Water Wife,\\" an inset tale in the novel The Unbeheaded King (Del Rey Books, 1983) explores and extends the same theme in a fantasy setting.

It is located circa north of the city centre. History The map used when the land was divided among the individual farmers in 1765 Ordrup was originally a small village which only consisted of eight farms and a forge. The area became a popular destination for excursions for citizens from Copenhagen in the 17th century. The farmers supplemented their income by harvesting peat that was sold on the market in Copenhagen. Jens Juel in c. 1793 Ordrup came under Bernstorff Palace in the 1760s after Foreign Minister Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff had received the entire area from Christian V as a gift. Bernstorff was a driving force behind the agricultural reforms of the time. A detailed map of the land was drawn up. The land was divided into lots. A draw which took place at Bernstorff Palace on 1 September 1765 distributed the lots among the local farmers. The names of the eight farms were Lindegaarden, Teglgaarden, Eigaarden, Holmegården, Skjoldgaarden, Hyldegaarden, Damgaarden and Skovgaarden. The reforms led to higher profits both for the farmers and Bernstorff. An inn opened in Ordrup on 2 February 1768. In 1770 only Damgården had moved out of the village to be closer to its land. Most of the remaining farms and houses in the village were destroyed in a fire on 6 September 1798. The fire began in Teglgården's workshop when a pot of glue that boiled over ignited some shavings. It was decided to rebuild the farms out on their fields. The lots in the village were sold to craftsmen or people from Copenhagen who constructed summer residences on them. Many of the farms were converted into country houses, especially after the opening of the Klampenborg Railway made the area more accessible from 1863. The first school in Ordrup opened on 1 May 1867. It was followed by the Catholic boy's school St. Andrew's College in 1873. The school had its own church. The school and church were built by Polly Berling, the owner of Ordruphøj, who had converted to Catholicism in 1869. A protestant parish church was built a few years later. Ordrup Velodrome and Ordrup School in 1956 Ordrup developed into a suburb as the farmland was built over with single family detached homes and apartment buildings in the first half of the 20th century. Landmarks Places of interest include the art museum of Ordrupgaard and Ordrup Church completed in 1876. Ordrup Asyl opened in the 1860s and is still in use as a daycare. Transport Ordrup Station built in 1924 is on the Klampenborgbanen S-train radial line providing service to Copenhagen.

Biography Born on 8 April 1875, Charles Edensor Heathcote was educated at Bedford School. He received his first commission as a Second Lieutenant in the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in March 1894. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 30 January 1898. Two years later, he was in January 1900 appointed to a staff position as Superintendent of Gymnasia at Malta, and promoted the rank of Captain on 23 April 1900. He served with the Royal West African Frontier Force, between 1904 and 1909, took part in the Onitsha Hinterland Expedition, between 1904 and 1905, and further operations in the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He was promoted to the rank of Major in November 1913, and served during the First World War, between 1914 and 1918. He departed for France with the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, on 31 October 1914, serving as a Company Commander and rising to be Commanding Officer. He served at the Battle of Mons, the Battle of Le Cateau, the First Battle of the Marne, the First Battle of the Aisne, at the First Battle of Ypres, and was wounded at Battle of Messines. He rejoined the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the Front in April 1915, fought in the Second Battle of Ypres, and was Commanding Officer of the Battalion again between May and September 1915. In September 1915, Heathcote became Commanding Officer of the 4th Battalion, Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, fighting at the Battle of Loos and during the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. He served in Egypt as part of the Suez Canal Defence Force, and in France at the Battle of Vimy Ridge until May 1916, when he was appointed as Brigadier General and given command of the 7th Infantry Brigade, leading the Brigade through further Vimy operations, and at the Battle of the Somme. He was next given command of the 9th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, with whom he fought in the Somme operations in September 1916, when he was wounded. Upon his return to the Front in early 1917, Heathcote was appointed to command the 7th Battalion, Royal Leicestershire Regiment, and fought with it throughout the Battle of Arras. In May 1917, he went to Egypt in order to command the 231st Infantry Brigade, which he commanded during the Battle of Beersheba and the Battle of Hareira and Sheria, operations to the west of Jerusalem, and in the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, as well as in fighting on the Nablus Road. He then took the 231st Brigade to the Western Front, where it went into battle south of Merville, Nord, in September 1918. From then until the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Brigade was constantly in action, participating in the Second Battle of the Somme and the attack on the Hindenburg Line, east of Ronssoy and Templeux-le-Guérard, in addition to the fighting which resulted in the re-occupation of the Aubers Ridge and Lille, and the fall of Tournai.

Description Iris brevicaulis is the smallest in all the Hexagonae series of Louisiana irises. Its leaves and stalks are much shorter than the other species. It is similar in form to Iris virginica,Michael A. Homoy The flowers are normally never seen above the foliage,Robert H. Mohlenbroc due to the short zig-zagging flower stems and occasionally, due to the habit of the stems to lie along the floor, or it is often decumbent (meaning the branches growing horizontally but turned up at the ends).Garrett E. Crow and C. Barre Hellquist It has a shallowly rooted, branching rhizome (about 10–25 mm in diameter),Donovan Stewart Correll and Helen B. Correll that can eventually form large colonies of plants (2 x 3 ft wide). It has long, glossy leaves, which are ensiform (sword-like), and grow from the base (of the plant). They are bright green, and grow to between long and broad.Edwin B. Smith It has a zig-zagged stem (known in botany as fractiflex; hence the common name of Zig- zag iris) going at approx. 45 degrees angles (to each other), which grows to between tall. It has about 3–6 flowers per stem, 1–2 flowers at each axil, and at the terminus of the stem.Steven Clemants, Steven Earl Clemants and Carol Gracie It begins blooming in early to mid summer, from April to mid-July, or June (in the UK). Occasionally it does not produce flowers every year. The flowers are produced in a range of blue shades, from violet-blue, to lavender, to purple-blue, to bright blue, to blue, and pale blue shades. There is occasionally a white flowered form. The large flowers are across, with horizontal falls (sepals) that arch downward and upright standards (petals). The petals are dark-veined and smaller than the sepals, which have a yellow (or whitish-yellow) signal patch or stripe. It has a yellow pubescence (rudimentary beard) on the sepals, (sometimes called falls). It has green styles and pale lavender style crests (which are ovate in form), and short anthers. It has a 6-angled seed capsule (similar to Iris hexagona), which is 3–5 cm long. Inside the irregular, circular seeds have a cork-like coating which allows them to float and thus aid in dispersal in its wet habitat. =Genetics= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count of 2n=44.Richard Gerald Harrison (Editor) It has been counted many times, 2n=44-Simonet 1934, 2n=42 by Randolph 1958 and 2n=42, Randolph in 1966. Taxonomy Addisonia It is pronounced as EYE-riss brev- ih-KAWL-iss.Sally Wasowski and Andy Wasowski It has several common names including 'Zig-zag iris', or short-stemmed iris, or 'Lamance iris',Tina M. Samuels (especially in Tennessee),J. Whitfield Gibbons, Robert Haynes, Robert R. Haynes and Joab L. Thomas William Cullina or 'Leafy Blue Flag', (especially in Ohio).Tom S. Cooperrider, Allison Cusick, John T. Kartesz (Editors) The name of 'Lamance iris' comes from 'Lora La Mance', an American horticulturalist and author (1857–1939).Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie and Joy Dorothy Harvey (Editors) The 'Brevicaulis' epithet comes from the latin for 'short stem'.Amanda Neill (Editor) It was first published and described by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 'Florula Ludoviciana', (Flora of the State of Louisiana) in 1817. Michael Foster was the first botanist and author to realise that Iris brevicaulis Raf. had the same description as Iris foliosa MacKenzie & Bush (published in Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis 12: 80–81. in 1902). Later authors agreed with this assessment, including Brian Mathew (The Iris,1981) and Clive Innes (The World of Iridaceae). But 'Iris foliosa' was used in the 1939 Checklist and 'Index Kewensis'. But most authors have agreed that Iris foliosa is a synonym. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 2 December 2004, and it is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris brevicaulis is the hardiest and most adaptable of all the Louisiana irises. Occurring a wide range of habitats. It is native to North America. =Range= It is found in Ontario, Canada, up as far north as the north-east shore of Lake Erie. Also in lots of states of the south-eastern United States, including Alabama (along various rivers,), Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,Linda G. Chafin Illinois, Indiana, Kansas (Leavenworth,), Kentucky,Edward T. Browne and Raymond Athey Louisiana, Mississippi (around the Mississippi river basin,), Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. (including the Big Thicket forest). =Habitat= Most Louisiana irises are found in the bayous of southern Louisiana, but Iris brevicaulis can tolerate drier soils than the other species and can also be found away from the swamp areas. It will grow in moist fields, damp prairies, wet meadows, moist woodlands, streams, riverbanks, marsh areas, around lakes, around ponds, in ravines at the base of wooded slopes (in Missouri) and in 'Bottomlands' (areas of low-lying alluvial land near a river). In places where moisture is generally high during the growing seasons (of fall (autumn), winter and spring). Conservation Iris brevicaulis due to habitat destruction can be classed as 'endangered'. In Canada, it is only found in the state of Ontario. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the Iris as a high priority candidate for assessment as a species at risk. A large population exists on the island of Pelee, which is now being conserved by volunteers. In the US, it was listed as 'threatened' in Ohio in 2012. In Illinois, it is listed as 'not common' with a scattered distribution. Cultivation The Louisiana irises generally all have similar cultivation requirements. Iris brevicaulis needs acidic soils (ph level of 6.5) with a high organic and high fertility content.Helen Nash It prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade and prefers wet soils it can tolerate well drained soil. For best flowering, moisture is essential during late autumn, winter and spring times (October to May), when the plant starts to grow new leaves.Neil G. Odenwald and James R. Turner They can be given a light feed between autumn and spring, if needed. They can be used planted by the edges of ponds, streams and pools, (or a bog garden), or woodland border. Once established they are thought to be a reliable source for fresh cut flowers and they can tolerate damage from deer. Propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes.Nick Romanowski Which is best carried out in late summer to early spring, when the plants are dormant. The ground must be prepared pre-planting, with the addition of a generous amount of organic matter and the soils dug to about 6 inches deep (to allow for new root growth). Plants require dividing every 3–4 years to promote good flowering. They can combine with other plants but tend to 'move' to suitable positions. If using a fertilizer, sprinkle around the plant in late January or February, before the plant is in flower. New plantings need to be mulched to prevent sun-scalding. The iris seed is not hard to raise but a very slow process. It can take many months to germinate (between 3–12 months) with a 50% germination average. They are best germinated using a cold frame. They then can take 3–5 years before reaching flowering stage. Seeds should be harvested from the plant directly after flowering but they must be from mature seed pods. They then should be stored in paper bags, as seed stored in glass containers often goes mouldy. It is estimated to be hardy to between USDA Zones 4 to 9. It is thought to be the hardiest of all Louisiana Irises. It can tolerate frost but will flower poorly in areas with cool summers. It can be grown in southern UK, in damp or wet soils. They can also be grown in most of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. They are generally trouble-free and can even tolerate nibbling by deer. They are often available at water garden centres in the US. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske The rhizomes (thickened roots) of Iris brevicaulis contain poison. If mistakenly eaten it could cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and an elevated temperature. The roots, seeds and plant sap can also cause skin irritation if touched. Pollination Iris brevicaulis is primarily pollinated by bumblebees. But it is also occasionally pollinated by hummingbirds. They are pollinated in different ways, the hummingbirds must use their head to push back the iris' petals in order to gain access to the nectar. Pollen is then transferred on a hummingbird's forehead. Hybrids Hybrid Iris brevicaulis 'Marie Caillet' from Adamstown, Maryland, USA Due to Iris brevicaulis adaptable habitat and greater hardiness (than other Louisiana Iris species), it has been used in hybridization by plant breeders. Iris brevicaulis can easily hybridize with other Louisiana irises to create new variants. One of the first was 'Iris fulvala', a hybrid Dykes raised as a cross between Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis. It produced two forms, both with rich velvety falls, one a red-purple form and the other was a bluer shade. The name was composed of Iris fulva and the first syllable of Lamance (the common name of Iris foliosa which was known at that time as 'Iris hexagona var. Lamancei'). Later Iris foliosa was found to be a synonym of Iris brevicaulis. The hybrids were found to be good garden plants and could flower more freely than either of the parents. It was crossed with Iris giganticaerulea to produce 'Iris × flexicaulis' Small. It is also the 'parent' of a very old (nearly 100 years old),hybrid 'Dorothea K. Williamson'. Other Iris brevicaulis cultivars include; 'Alabamensis', 'All Falls', 'Boonensis', 'Brevipes', 'Finders Keepers', 'Foliosa Alba', 'Mac's White', 'Meadow Frost', 'Mississippiensis', 'Ottine', 'Petite And Sweet', 'Pink Joy Roberts', 'Slowpoke', 'Territorial Rights', 'Trail Of Tears', 'Triple Treat'.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Illinois Senate, as well as Chicago City Council before his election to Congress. A candidate for mayor of Chicago in the 2015 election, García finished second in the February 24 general election and forced a head-to-head runoff against the incumbent, Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel won the April 7 runoff. García was first elected to the Chicago City Council in 1986, and in 1992 became the first Mexican-American member of the Illinois Senate. In 2010, García won election to the 7th district of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and after his election was appointed floor leader by Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle. He won a seat in the U.S. House in the 2018 election, replacing retiring Representative Luis Gutiérrez. Early life and education García was born in Mexico in the state of Durango. His father was a farm laborer under the U.S. government's World War II-era bracero program. García moved to the US in 1965 with permanent resident status. The family settled in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. (García continues to reside there.) He attended St. Rita High School, graduating in 1974. García became a citizen of the United States in 1977. García worked at the Legal Assistance Foundation from 1977 to 1980 as he worked towards a B.A. in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He then became Assistant Director of the Little Village Neighborhood Housing Service, where he worked until 1984. In 2002, he returned to school to earn a Master in Urban Planning and Policy from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Early political career =Chicago City Council= In 1983, García was the campaign manager for labor organizer Rudy Lozano, who challenged longtime alderman Frank Stemberk of the 22nd Ward. In the February 1983 election, Lozano came 17 votes short of forcing a runoff, which his supporters contended was due to voters with Spanish surnames being purged from the rolls, denying him the votes to force a runoff. Lozano was murdered in June 1983, shot to death in his home. A reputed gang member was convicted of Lozano's murder, but his supporters still contend that he was assassinated for his labor and political activities. In 1984, García challenged Stemberk for his place as a Committeeman in the Cook County Democratic Party. Supporters of Lozano rallied around him and he received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington. Stemberk was a supporter of alderman Edward Vrdolyak of the 10th Ward, who controlled the City Council and opposed Mayor Washington's administration. This divide within city government was dubbed the \\"Council Wars\\" by the Chicago media. With Lozano supporters taking to the race with a \\"religious fervour\\" and Washington campaigning heavily on García's behalf, he defeated Stemberk by 2,811 votes (40.62%) to 2,752 (39.77%), with activist and former labor union leader August Sallas taking 1,357 (19.61%). Unlike other committeemen and women, García used his office to provide constituent services, which helped him maintain his high-profile. García was also appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Water by Washington, a post he held from 1984 to 1986. García in 2015 Meanwhile, Washington's allies had sued the city in federal court, claiming that the ward map drawn up after the 1980 Census had unfairly dispersed black and Hispanic voters. At that time, whites were about 40% of the city's population, blacks were also about 40%, and Hispanics were about 15%, but there were 33 white aldermen, only 16 blacks and just 1 Hispanic. In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, judge Charles Ronald Norgle Sr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered a special election for March 18, 1986 in seven wards, including the 22nd. The special elections gave Washington the opportunity to wrest control of the city council from Vrdolyak. Stemberk chose not to run for re-election and García declared his candidacy. In the nonpartisan election, García faced supermarket owner and Stemberk ally Guadalupe Martinez and beauty supply store owner Fred Yanez. Yanez emphasised his military service and Martinez called García \\"100 percent Communist\\" and criticised him for selling garbage cans, which Martinez gave away for free. García won by 3,293 votes (54.58%) to Martinez' 2,013 (33.37%) and Yanez' 727 (12.05%), carrying 26 of the 27 precincts. García was also re-elected Committeeman with 53.98% of the vote, carrying 24 of the 27 precincts. His election and the victory of two other Washington supporters meant that Vrdolyak's supporters had a one-seat majority. Six weeks later, Washington ally Luis Gutiérrez won a runoff in the 26th Ward and the council was thus evenly split between Washington and Vrdolyak supporters. Washington had the ability to cast tie-breaking votes, Vrdolyak was stripped of his powers and the Council Wars ended. García was re-elected with 3,998 votes (53.59%) in 1987 and with 2,707 votes (52.36%) in 1991. On the council, he served on the Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, Municipal Code Revision and Ethics; Economic Development; Education; Finance; License; Ports, Wharves, and Bridges; Streets and Alleys; Traffic Control and Safety committees and chaired the Aviation committee. =Illinois Senate= García at a Bernie Sanders rally in Los Angeles, California, May 2016 Democratic State Senator Howard W. \\"Howie\\" Carroll of the 1st district of the Illinois Senate was redistricted to the 8th district, and in 1992 García ran for the Illinois Senate in the 1st district, winning the open-seat Democratic primary with 8,604 votes (52.06%) to Donald C. Smith's 6,159 (37.26%) and Gilbert G. Jimenez's 1,765 (10.68%). The primary was tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic 1st district and in the general election, and García defeated Republican nominee Esequiel \\"Zeke\\" Iracheta by 21,314 votes (81.74%) to 4,762 (18.26%). García was the first Illinois State Senator of Mexican descent. García resigned from the City Council and was succeeded by his protégé Ricardo Muñoz. In the 1996 Democratic primary, he was challenged by Alderman Juan Soliz of the 25th Ward. Soliz, who had also been elected in the March 1986 special elections, had been supported by Vrdolyak, earning him the ire of Chicago Hispanics. When Soliz was elected, he called for unity among Hispanic aldermen, a plea which they ignored. Soliz and García even celebrated their inaugurations by hiring separate Mariachi bands to play outside the council chambers. After Soliz was replaced as Chairman of the Aviation Committee by García, he derided it as a \\"racist move,\\" though they were both Mexican-Americans. García defeated Soliz by 6,839 votes (59.34%) to 4,686 (40.66%). García was re-elected unopposed in the general election. In office, García helped shepherd \\"immigrant-friendly\\" health care and education reforms through the legislature. García was defeated in the 1998 Democratic primary election by Antonio Munoz, who was backed by the Hispanic Democratic Organization, Mayor Richard M. Daley's campaign group and political machine. Munoz defeated García by 6,924 votes (53.72%) to 5,964 (46.28%). Alderman Ricardo Muñoz (no relation to Antonio Munoz), talking in 2010 about his mentor's defeat, said: \\"Part of the rationale that I think Chuy lost in '98 was that we got sloppy and they [Munoz and the HDO] got lucky. It rained all day, and we didn't have raincoats for our guys until 11 o'clock. By that time, they were frozen stiff. So we lost the field game.\\" Political interregnum After his defeat, García left office in January 1999, founded and became Executive Director of the Little Village Community Development Corporation. He helped grow what is now known as Enlace to twenty-seven full-time employees, 120 part-time employees, and an annual budget of $5 million. In June 2005, he helped found the Latino Action Research Network, a PAC to help better represent the city's Latino population. On Mother's Day 2001, García and members of the group demanded the construction of a high school promised to the community, but unfunded. Fourteen parents and grandparents organized a hunger strike. While Paul Vallas, the CEO of Chicago Public Schools, initially refused to meet with the hunger strikers, by the end of the first week, he visited their tent to negotiate terms. The hunger strike lasted nineteen days and increased public pressure on the school district to fund the project. In August 2001, the newly appointed CEO of Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, reallocated funds to begin construction on the school. Community members continued to advocate for participation in designing the new school, and door- to-door parent surveys contributed to the curricular focus of each school on the campus. Cook County Board of Commissioners In 2010, García ran for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, challenging 7th district member and HDO candidate Joseph Mario Moreno in the Democratic primary. García defeated him by 9,602 votes (54.74%) to 7,939 (45.26%). In the general election, he faced Green Party nominee Paloma M. Andrade and defeated her by 24,612 votes (86.29%) to 3,912 (13.72%). After the election, Toni Preckwinkle appointed García Floor Leader. García was re-elected unopposed to a second term on the Board of Commissioners in the 2014 elections. 2015 Chicago mayoral election García in 2017 at a protest against Donald Trump García entered the mayoral race against incumbent mayor Rahm Emanuel after being recruited by Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, a leading progressive candidate who had fallen ill and was forced to call off her own campaign. García won 34% of the vote in the February 24 primary, and Emanuel failed to win more than 50%, forcing a runoff election between the two on April 7. The campaign received national attention and was considered by some a preview of the upcoming 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed García in what he called a \\"political revolution in Chicago.\\" Emanuel won the runoff election with 55% of the vote. García opposes the Ashland Bus Rapid Transit plan, the Belmont flyover, and red light cameras. After the mayoral election García endorsed Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in the 2016 election and the 2020 election. After incumbent and formal rival Rahm Emanuel announced that he would not seek a third term in 2019, many people speculated that a high-ranking Latino politician would enter the race. Gutiérrez and García were seen as potential candidates. After Gutiérrez declined to run, he expressed his intent to draft García into the race. Sanders expressed his desire for García to \\"take a look for running for mayor.\\" García ultimately did not run. In the runoff of the 2019 mayoral election, García endorsed Lori Lightfoot, which delivered a further blow to the already faltering campaign of Lightfoot's opponent, Toni Preckwinkle. Preckwinkle, who had been García's ally on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, had declined to endorse him for mayor in 2015. Lightfoot ultimately defeated Preckwinkle in a landslide. U.S. House of Representatives García at a congressional campaign rally in South Lawndale, Chicago, February 2018 = Elections =  2018  On November 27, 2017, just 6 days before the final day to file petitions to run for the office, Congressman Luis Gutiérrez pulled his petition for reelection in 2018, effectively choosing to retire at the conclusion of his current term. The next day García signaled his intention to run for the open seat. During Gutiérrez's press conference, he endorsed García as his successor. The next day, Sanders endorsed García. Politico described Gutiérrez's sudden retirement as \\"totally abnormal\\" and his endorsement of García as a \\"coronation\\", as the district is so heavily Democratic that the primary is the real contest and the general election is effectively a formality. García won the Democratic nomination in March 2018 with 60% of the primary vote. He defeated financial adviser Mark Wayne Lorch in the November 6 general election, receiving over 86% of the vote. =Tenure= = Committee assignments = * Committee on Financial Services ** Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy * Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ** Subcommittee on Aviation ** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit ** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials = Caucus memberships = * Congressional Hispanic Caucus * Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus * Congressional Progressive Caucus Electoral history  Political positions  = Immigration = During a congressional hearing in July 2019, García asked former ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan about the Trump administration family separation policy \\"how [he] can possibly allow this to happen under [his] watch, [does he] not care?

On December 10, 2019, García introduced the New Way Forward Act, an immigration reform bill. = Foreign policy = In July 2019, García voted against a House resolution condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398-17. Personal life García with his wife Evelyn and daughter García married Evelyn García in 1980. They have three children.

It was fought between a 50-gun Royal Naval ship against an armed Spanish register merchant ship that carried 26 guns.Clowes p.46Haenke, p. 68Dávalos, p. 114. On 19 November 1779, HMS Hussar of 28 guns, under Captain Elliot Salter, was in company with HMS Chatham of 50 guns. They were convoying trade from Lisbon back to England when they saw a two-decked ship standing out of the convoy, and at once gave chase. Hussar came up with the ship the next day and, on observing the Spanish flag being hoisted, Salter gave the order to attack. Hussar came alongside the Spanish ship and opened fire and, having the weather gage, was able to rake the ship. After a number of broadsides and realizing resistance was useless, the Spaniard struck after nearly 45 minutes of action. The Spanish ship was the Nuestra Senora del Buen Consejo, a Peruvian register ship from Lima pierced for 64 guns but mounting only 26 twelve-pounders with a crew of 120 sailors and marines. Consejo had 27 men killed and eight wounded with the rest captured; whilst the Hussar had four killed and ten wounded. Buen Consejo carried a valuable cargo consisting of copper, pewter, cocoa, Jesuit's bark, minerals and private goods, all of which were taken by the British back to England.

The use of smartphones for mobile banking, investing, borrowing services, and cryptocurrency are examples of technologies aiming to make financial services more accessible to the general public. Financial technology companies consist of both startups and established financial institutions and technology companies trying to replace or enhance the usage of financial services provided by existing financial companies. Definition After reviewing more than 200 scientific papers citing the term \\"fintech,\\" a study on the definition of fintech concluded that \\"fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities.\\" Fintech is the new applications, processes, products, or business models in the financial services industry, composed of one or more complementary financial services and provided as an end-to-end process via the Internet. Fintech can also be considered as “any innovative ideas that improve financial service processes by proposing technology solutions according to different business situations, while the ideas could also lead to new business models or even new businesses.\\"  Key areas  Financial technology has been used to automate investments, insurance, trading, banking services and risk management.Aldridge, I., Krawciw S., 2017. Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About Fintech, High-Frequency Trading and Flash Crashes. Hoboken: Wiley. The services may originate from various independent service providers including at least one licensed bank or insurer. The interconnection is enabled through open APIs and open banking and supported by regulations such as the European Payment Services Directive. In trading on capital markets, innovative electronic trading platforms facilitate trades online and in real time. Social trading networks allow investors to observe the trading behavior of their peers and expert traders and to follow their investment strategies on currency exchange and capital markets. The platforms require little or no knowledge about financial markets, and have been described as disruptors which provide \\"a low-cost, sophisticated alternative to traditional wealth managers\\" by the World Economic Forum. Robo-advisers are a class of automated financial adviser that provide financial advice or investment management online with moderate to minimal human intervention. They provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithms, and thus can provide a low-cost alternative to a human advisers. Global investment in financial technology increased more than 2,200% from $930 million in 2008 to more than $22 billion in 2015. The nascent financial technology industry in London has seen rapid growth over the last few years, according to the office of the Mayor of London. Forty percent of the City of London's workforce is employed in financial and technology services. In Europe, $1.5 billion was invested in financial technology companies in 2014, with London-based companies receiving $539 million, Amsterdam-based companies $306 million, and Stockholm-based companies receiving $266 million in investment. After London, Stockholm is the second highest funded city in Europe in the past 10 years. Europe's fintech deals reached a five-quarter high, rising from 37 in Q4 2015 to 47 in Q1 2016. Lithuania is starting to become a northern European hub for financial technology companies since the news in 2016 about the possible exit of Britain from the European Union. Lithuania has issued 51 fintech licenses since 2016, 32 of those in 2017. Fintech companies in the United States raised $12.4 billion in 2018, a 43% increase over 2017 figures. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund addressing in 2018 at the Singapore FinTech Festival, the largest FinTech festival in the world. In the Asia Pacific region, the growth will see a new financial technology hub to be opened in Sydney, in April 2015. According to KPMG, Sydney's financial services sector in 2017 creates 9 per cent of national GDP and is bigger than the financial services sector in either Hong Kong or Singapore. A financial technology innovation lab was launched in Hong Kong in 2015. In 2015, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched an initiative named Fintech and Information Group to draw in start-ups from around the world. It pledged to spend $225 million in the fintech sector over the next five years. While Singapore has been one of the central Fintech hubs in Asia, start ups in the sector from Vietnam and Indonesia have been attracting more venture capital investments in recent years. Since 2014, Southeast Asian Fintech companies have increased VC funding from $35 million to $679 million in 2018 and $1.14 billion in 2019. Fintech start-ups around the world have been noted for their innovation, creativity, and cutting-edge work styles, and as a result these aspects have worked their way into each workplaces’ culture. This emphasis on collaboration and alliance has resulted in workplaces where afternoon office happy hours occur every Friday, in-office yoga classes are offered to help relieve employees’ stress, and other engaging activities are hosted. These environments are not only fun for employees, but build a more productive and friendly workplace that enhance company performance. What makes fintech's workplace culture especially unique is the methods used to preserve this special environment, which is through the hiring process. There are three key ways fintech start-ups maintain this state-of-the-art culture through their hiring process: involving the whole crew, being consistent, and clarifying their mission. By allowing multiple departments to have a say in who is hired and making their mission clear to all prospective employees, start-ups are able to attract prospects who hold the same values and goals as the company itself. The unique workplace culture fintech startups operate around gives fintech an edge over traditional banking and explains why fintech is the future of the financial industry.  Technologies  Within the financial services industry, some of the used technologies include artificial intelligence (AI), big data, robotic process automation (RPA), and blockchain. Artificial Intelligence is a blanket term for many different technologies. In terms of the \\"fintech\\" industry, AI is used in various forms. AI algorithms can be used to predict changes in the stock market and give insight into the economy. AI is used to provide insight on customer spending habits and allows financial institutions to better understand their clients. Chatbots are another AI-driven tool that banks are starting to use to help with customer service. Big Data is another \\"fintech\\" technology that financial institutions utilize. In the finance sector, big data can be used to predict client investments and market changes and create new strategies and portfolios. Big Data can be used to analyze customer spending habits and therefore improve fraud detection. Big Data helps banks create segmented marketing strategies and can be used to optimize the operations of a company. Robotic Process Automation is an artificial intelligence technology that focuses on automating specific repetitive tasks. In terms of \\"fintech\\", RPA is used to perform manual tasks that often are repetitive and completed daily. These tasks just involve the input of information into a system and do not require much skill thus companies are replacing them with RPA which can complete the task quicker and more efficiently. RPA helps to process financial information such as accounts payable and receivable more efficiently than the manual process and often more accurately. RPA can be used to increase the productivity of the financial company. Blockchain is another financial technology that is beginning to be used in the industry. Out of all the \\"fintech\\" technologies, blockchain was developed for the purposes of finance and thus has direct ties to financial institutions. Though blockchain is still an emerging technology, many companies recognize the impact that it will have and are investing accordingly.  Awards and recognition  Financial magazine Forbes created a list of the leading disruptors in financial technology for its Forbes 2019 global Fintech 50. In Europe there is a list called the FinTech 50, which aims to recognise the most innovative companies in fintech. A report published in February 2016 by EY commissioned by the UK Treasury compared seven leading fintech hubs: the United Kingdom, California, New York City, Singapore, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. It ranked California first for 'talent' and 'capital', the United Kingdom first for 'government policy' and New York City first for 'demand'. For the past few years, PwC has posted a report called the \\"Global Fintech Report\\". In the 2019, the report covers many topics revolving around the financial technology sector. The report discusses the landscape of the \\"Fintech\\" industry and some of the emerging technologies in the sector. It provides strategies for financial institutions on how to incorporate more \\"fintech\\" technologies into their business. Outlook Finance is seen as one of the industries most vulnerable to disruption by software because financial services, much like publishing, are made of information rather than concrete goods. In particular blockchains have the potential to reduce the cost of transacting in a financial system. While finance has been shielded by regulation until now, and weathered the dot-com boom without major upheaval, a new wave of startups is increasingly \\"disaggregating\\" global banks. However, aggressive enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and money transmission regulations represents an ongoing threat to fintech companies. In response, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank jointly presented Bali Fintech Agenda on October 11, 2018 which consists of 12 policy elements acting as a guidelines for various governments and central banking institutions to adopt and deploy \\"rapid advances in financial technology\\". The New York Venture Capital Association (NYVCA) hosts annual summits to educate those interested in learning more about fintech. In 2018 alone, fintech was responsible for over 1,700 deals worth over 40 billion dollars. Challenges and solutions In addition to established competitors, fintech companies often face doubts from financial regulators like issuing banks and the Federal Government. In July 2018, the Trump Administration issued a policy statement that allowed FinTech companies to apply for special purpose national bank charters from the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Federal preemption applies to state law regarding federally chartered banks.. Data security is another issue regulators are concerned about because of the threat of hacking as well as the need to protect sensitive consumer and corporate financial data. Leading global fintech companies are proactively turning to cloud technology to meet increasingly stringent compliance regulations. The Federal Trade Commission provides free resources for corporations of all sizes to meet their legal obligations of protecting sensitive data. Several private initiatives suggest that multiple layers of defense can help isolate and secure financial data. In the European Union, fintech companies must adhere to data protection laws, such as GDPR. Companies need to proactively protect users and companies data or face fines of 20 million euros, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of their total global turnover. In addition to GDPR, European financial institutions including fintech firms have to update their regulatory affairs departments with the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), meaning they must organise their revenue structure around a central goal of privacy. Any data breach, no matter how small, can result in direct liability to a company (see the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) and ruin a fintech company's reputation. The online financial sector is also an increasing target of distributed denial of service extortion attacks. This security challenge is also faced by historical bank companies since they do offer Internet-connected customer services.

(new play-in-progress)  Reviews  Louise Kennedy of The Boston Globe says of Smith's Boots on the Ground: > \\"Boots on the Ground\\" is successful precisely because it avoids polemic, on > either side. It aims to show us the human cost of war, and it succeeds. Then > it wisely lets us reflect on whether the cost is worth it, rather than > telling us what to feel. Kennedy also writes of Some Things Are Private, saying: > \\"Luminous, intelligent, provocative, and deeply moving,\\" adding that it is > also \\"great fun - never preachy, often humorous, and suffused throughout > with a mixture of emotional warmth and intellectual engagement that's only > too rare in contemporary culture.\\" Dr. Pauline W. Chen of The New York Times says of Love Alone: > Few plays or movies capture the emotional and professional aftermath of a > medical error...Love Alone [is a] lucid, deeply nuanced and fearless work. The Providence Journal's Channing Gray writes of Smith and Love Alone: > Smith tells a balanced tale that tells both sides of the issue, and she does > so with subtlety and well-crafted dialogue...\\"Love Alone\\" is...most > ambitious and most cogent...showing real maturity. Larry O’Brien of Broadway World says of Smith’s Faithful Cheaters: > This is a screwball comedy that would have made George S. Kaufman proud. David Christner of The Newport Daily News says: > \\"Faithful Cheaters\\" is as frantic a farce as any Frenchman ever formulated, > but underlying all the good humor and physical comedy is a touching story > about love. The structure of Smith’s comedy follows a formula that is > centuries old, only deviating from the form when the playwright momentarily > puts the hijinks aside and allows the emotional side of her characters to be > exposed. It is in these small moments where Smith’s gift for exploring the > fragility of the human heart through her words truly shines and makes this > production so extraordinary.

He was a member of the Union Nationalist group representing an important role in the struggle for Dominican sovereignty against United States military intervention (1916-1924). In the Superior Institute of Teacher Education Salomé Ureña there is a site that bears his name. Early life Félix Evaristo Mejia was born on September 26, 1866 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He studied at the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga, from where he went to the School of Santo Domingo, becoming director of the latter, a position he held subsequently in public education. In 1884, he went into exile in Caracas, Venezuela in opposition to the dictatorial Ulises Heureaux. In Venezuela, he devoted himself to teaching, shortly after returning to the Dominican Republic where he continued his career as a teacher. Career In 1890, on his return to Santo Domingo he had to replace his teacher Eugenio Maria de Hostos in the direction as head of the school. As the general superintendent of education, Félix Evaristo had the opportunity to contribute his ideas to the progress of Dominican culture during the period characterized by violence, uncertainty and growing political and economic aggression by the United States in the country. School organization of the time and its relative expansion is due largely to his activity with secular and positivist orientation of Hostos guy who had bequeathed Hostos. Also, many of his published mainly in the fields of history and literature, as well as its activity as an organizer and owner of the first Dominican library, the Library Selecta, works especially addressed his heartfelt desire to fill bibliographic needs as a means of contributing to the intellectual and moral formation of the Dominican youth. Personal life Félix Evaristo Mejía was married to Natalia Pérez Ricart, with whom he had three children; Ofelia, Gustavo and Publio. His son Gustavo was also a prominent Dominican writer.

Background The Guggisberg constitution was promulgated in May 1925, and provided for a 30-member Legislative Council with 16 official members and 14 unofficial members.F M Bourret (1952) The Gold Coast: A Survey of the Gold Coast and British Togoland, Stanford University Press, p49Dolf Sternberger, Bernhard Vogel, Dieter Nohlen & Klaus Landfried (1969) Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Erster Halbband, p754 Of the 14 unofficial members, three were Europeans appointed by the Governor to represent banking, mercantile and shipping interests, and two were Europeans elected by the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Mines. The remaining nine unofficial members were Africans, six of which were elected by the Provincial Councils (three by the Eastern Province Council, two by the Central Province Council and one by the Western Province Council) and three members representing the three municipalities of Accra, Cape Coast and Sekondi. Western Province Council refused to elect its member, who was substituted by Nana Ofori Atta from the Eastern Province by the Governor.Bourret, p52 In 1927 the constitution was amended to allow for the three municipal representatives to be directly elected.John Parker (2000) Making the Town: Ga State and Society in Early Colonial Accra, p225 However, the franchise was severely limited, with only 1,816 people registered to vote in Accra from a population of 40,000, and 672 in Sekondi (less than 2% of the town's population).Holmes, p629Edsman, p128 Campaign Having initially been opposed to the limited electoral representation, moderate African leaders agreed to participate in the elections following a meeting between the Governor and J. E. Casely Hayford, F. V. Nanka-Bruce and John Glover Addo. However, Kobina Sekyi and the Cape Coast branch of the Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society (ARPS) continued to refuse to participate.Alexander Baron Holmes IV (1944) Economic and Political Organization in the Gold Coast 1920–1945, pp620–621 Although Casely Hayford attempted to have Henry van Hien nominated as a candidate in Cape Coast, this was opposed by the local Omanhene and the ARPS, and no candidate was forthcoming.Edsman, p127 Prior to the elections, Casely Hayford attempted to form organisations to support himself and his followers. In Accra, the contest was effectively between the National Congress of British West Africa and the ARPS. Several former members of Congress formed the Accra Ratepayers Association in June 1927 with Glover Addo as their candidate.Edsman, p125 From the ARPS side, A. W. Kojo Thompson (who had been appointed to the Legislative Council in 1926)Holmes, p625 ran as the Mambii Party candidate, supported by the Mantsemei.Edsman, pp99, 125 However, Thompson's support was weakened by the breakaway Asere Kowulu Non-Party Society, which nominated K. Quartey-Papafio as a protest by the Asere people against Kojo Thompson's selection.Holmes, p625 Although Quartey-Papafio was not a serious contender in the election, his main aim was to take votes from Kojo Thompson.Holmes, p628 Neither major candidate had a manifesto, with the campaign instead focusing on their character. Ratepayers member Nanka-Bruce used his newspaper The Gold Coast Independent to denounce Thompson and the Mambii Party.Edsman, p126 In Sekondi, the Sekondi Municipal Electors Association was formed in June to discuss politics and educate voters.Holmes, p632 It proposed five candidates, but only two opted to contest the elections – Casely Hayford and George James Christian, a barrister who had immigrated from the West Indies.

The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of mining for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for- profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services. Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from computer science, data mining, machine learning and statistics. Social media miners develop algorithms suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data. In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens. Background As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein, social media is the \\"group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user- generated content.\\" There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking (Facebook or LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), photo sharing (Flickr, Instagram, Photobucket, or Picasa), news aggregation (Google Reader, StumbleUpon, or Feedburner), video sharing (YouTube, MetaCafe), livecasting (Ustream or Twitch), virtual worlds (Kaneva), social gaming (World of Warcraft), social search (Google, Bing, or Ask.com), and instant messaging (Google Talk, Skype, or Yahoo! messenger). The first social media website was introduced by GeoCities in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of HTML coding. The first social networking site, SixDegrees.com, was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma. Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.  Uses  Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm. Once the data received goes through social media analytics, it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). \\"A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media\\". ACM Computing Surveys, 49: 3. These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes. Social analytics also uses sentiment analysis, because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., & Stahl, F., (2013). \\"A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis.\\" This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., & Beg, M. (2017). \\"Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining.\\" International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 8: 5. These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network. Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for influencer marketing. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites. Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends. Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter. These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity. By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with. Research =Research areas= * Social media event detection – Social networks enable users to freely communicate with each other and share their recent news, ongoing activities or views about different topics. As a result, they can be seen as a potentially viable source of information to understand the current emerging topics/events. * Public health monitoring and surveillance - Using large-scale analysis of social media to study large cohorts of patients and the general public, e.g. to obtain early warning signals of drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions, or understand human reproduction and sexual interest. * Community structure (Community Detection/Evolution/Evaluation) – Identifying communities on social networks, how they evolve, and evaluating identified communities, often without ground truth. * Network measures – Measuring centrality, transitivity, reciprocity, balance, status, and similarity in social media. * Network models – Simulate networks with specific characteristics. Examples include random graphs (E-R models), Preferential attachment models, and small-world models. * Information cascade – Analyzing how information propagates in social media sites. Examples include herd behavior, information cascades, diffusion of innovations, and epidemic models. * Influence and homophily – Measuring network assortativity and measuring and modeling influence and homophily. * Recommendation in social media – recommending friends or items on social media sites. * Social search – Searching for information on the social web. * Sentiment analysis in social media – Identifying collectively subjective information, e.g. positive and negative, from social media data. * Social spammer detection – Detecting social spammers who send out unwanted spam content appearing on social networks and any website with user-generated content to targeted users, often corroborating to boost their social influence, legitimacy, credibility. *Feature selection with social media data – Transforming feature selection to harness the power of social media. *Trust in social media – Studying and understanding of trust in social media. *Distrust and negative links – Exploring negative links in social media. *Role of social media in crises – Social media is continuing to play an important role during crises, particularly Twitter. Studies show that it is possible to detect earthquakes and rumors using tweets published during crisis. Developing tools to help first responders to analyze tweets towards better crisis response and developing techniques to provide them faster access to relevant tweets is an active area of research. *Location-based social network mining – Mining Human Mobility for Personalized POI Recommendation on Location-based Social Networks. *Provenance of information in social media – Provenance informs a user about the sources of a given piece of information. Social media can help in identifying the provenance of information due its unique features: user- generated content, user profiles, user interactions, and spatial or temporal information. *Vulnerability management – A user's vulnerability on a social networking sites can be managed in three sequential steps: (1) identifying new ways in which a user can be vulnerable, (2) quantifying or measuring a user's vulnerability, and (3) reducing or mitigating them. *Opinion mining on candidates/parties - Social media is a popular medium for candidates/parties to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voters' opinion. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media posts can match (or even improve) traditional opinion polls. = Publication venues= Social media mining research articles are published in computer science, social science, and data mining conferences and journals: Conferences Conference papers can be found in proceedings of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), World Wide Web (WWW), Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), Internet Measuring Conference (IMC). * KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining * WWW Conference – International World Wide Web Conference * WSDM Conference – ACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining * CIKM Conference – ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management * ICDM Conference – IEEE International Conference on Data Mining * Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) * ASONAM conference - IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining * Internet Measuring Conference (IMC) * International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) * International Conference on Social Media & Society * International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE) * The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases(ECML/PKDD), * International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), * Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), * Recommender Systems (RecSys) * Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) * Social Computing Behavioral-Cultural Modeling and Prediction (SBP). * HT Conference – ACM Conference on Hypertext * SDM Conference – SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SIAM) * PAKDD Conference – The annual Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Journals * DMKD Conference – Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery * ECML-PKDD Conference – European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases * IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), * ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD) * ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) * Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) * Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS) * ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB) * World Wide Web Journal * Social Networks * Internet Mathematics * IEEE Intelligent Systems * SIGKDD Exploration.

It is an asymmetrical multiplayer game that pits treasure hunting divers against sharks. Gameplay The game is a first-person shooter taking place in underwater environments. Players can either be divers or sharks. Divers escort and defend an automated submersible to collect sunken treasure, utilizing firearms, harpoons, explosives, and other equipment bought with collected treasure, while sharks, with different species having different abilities, \\"evolve\\" new abilities by killing and eating divers. Games are won by either side running out of respawns, by divers successfully escorting the submersible to an extraction point, or by sharks destroying the submersible. Development Depth began production in 2009, as a student project built as a mod for Unreal Tournament 3, by a small team led by Alex Quick of Killing Floor fame. Between 2010 and 2012, the game was ported to UDK and became a standalone game. However, development became stalled, due to concerns over gameplay. In 2013, Digital Confectioners partnered with the team to finish development. In 2016, Digital Confectioners bought out the project and have continued development on the title since. Release Depth was put on the Steam store as a pre-order on October 16, 2014, and released on November 3, 2014. \\"The Big Catch\\" update was released on December 16, 2014, adding 2 new shark classes, 1 new map and a new game type called \\"Megalodon Hunt.\\" Reception Depth received moderately positive reviews from critics. IGN described Depth as having \\"an ocean of tense, unique gameplay moments,\\" praising the game's level and sound design and describing playing as both a diver or a shark is a \\"fast, fun, and frantic experience.\\" IGN criticized the game's lack of game modes and its \\"skimpy\\" customization options, saying that they \\"doubt the longevity of this otherwise ship-shape game.\\" GameSpot is less favorable, noting low-quality textures, balancing issues and lack of memorable levels, describing the game as shallow. GameSpot did hope that future updates to clean up bugs and add new content could help the game reach its full potential. Both Multiplayer and GameSpot stated that the game negatively draws from the gameplay established in the Left for Dead series. Independent review site deviantrobot said that Depth is very similar to Evolve, though that \\"the game is unique enough that it stands on its own merits and it’s not just to fill the Evolve-shaped hole in your gaming library.\\" References External links * * Depth on Steam Category:2014 video games Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games Category:Indie video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games Category:Shark attacks in fiction Category: Scuba diving video games Category:Video games developed in New Zealand ","title":"Depth (video game)"},{"id":"44518770","title":"Constituency PS-32 (Khairpur-IV)"},{"id":"44518772","title":"Constituency PS-33 (Khairpur-V)"},{"id":"44518774","title":"Constituency PS-34 (Khairpur-VI)"},{"id":"44518775","title":"Constituency PS-35 (Larkana-I)"},{"id":"44518776","title":"Constituency PS-36 (Larkana-II)"},{"id":"44518777","title":"Constituency PS-37 (Larkana-III)"},{"id":"44518779","title":"Constituency PS-38 (Larkana-IV)"},{"id":"44518781","title":"Constituency PS-39 (Larkana-V)"},{"id":"44518783","title":"Constituency PS-40 (Larkana-VI)"},{"id":"44518784","title":"Constituency PS-41 (Larkana-VII)"},{"id":"44518785","title":"Constituency PS-42 (Larkana-VII)"},{"id":"44518786","title":"Constituency PS-43 (Matiari)"},{"id":"44518787","title":"Constituency PS-44 (Hyderabad-II)"},{"id":"44518788","title":"Constituency PS-45 (Hyderabad-III)"},{"id":"44518789","title":"Constituency PS-47 (Hyderabad-V)"},{"id":"44518790","title":"Constituency PS-48 (Hyderabad-VI)"},{"id":"44518791","title":"Constituency PS-46 (Hyderabad-IV)"},{"id":"44518792","title":"Constituency PS-49 (Hyderabad-VI)"},{"id":"44518793","title":"Constituency PS-50 (Hyderabad-VIII)"},{"id":"44518794","title":"Constituency PS-51 (Hyderabad-IX)"},{"id":"44518795","title":"Constituency PS-52 (Hyderabad-X)"},{"id":"44518796","title":"Constituency PS-53 (Hyderabad-XI)"},{"id":"44518798","title":"Constituency PS-54 (Hyderabad-XII)"},{"id":"44518799","title":"Constituency PS-55 (Badin-I)"},{"id":"44518800","title":"Constituency PS-56 (Badin-II)"},{"id":"44518801","title":"Constituency PS-57 (Badin-III)"},{"id":"44518802","title":"Constituency PS-58 (Badin-II)"},{"id":"44518803","title":"Constituency PS-59 (Badin-V)"},{"id":"44518804","title":"Constituency PS-60 (Tharparkar-I)"},{"id":"44518805","title":"Constituency PS-61 (Tharparkar-II)"},{"id":"44518806","title":"Constituency PS-62 (Tharparkar-III)"},{"id":"44518809","title":"Constituency PS-63 (Tharparkar-IV)"},{"id":"44518812","title":"Grim (Kristiansand)"},{"id":"44518816","title":"XCOM 2"},{"id":"44518844","text":"Mary C. Beckerle is an American cell biologist who studies cancer at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah School of Medicine. At Huntsman Cancer Institute, she serves as the CEO and also as Associate Vice President for Cancer Affairs at the University of Utah. Beckerle’s research helped to define a novel molecular pathway for cell motility, and more recently, she has begun research into Ewing’s sarcoma, a pediatric bone cancer. Beckerle’s lab has already made a ground breaking discover in regards to Ewing’s Sarcoma in relation to the EWS/FLI protein.Neufield, Erica. “Huntsman Cancer Institute Awarded Grant for Children's Cancer Research” CureSearch for Children’s Cancer. Her lab discovered EWS/FLI to disrupt the internal cellular skeleton, which decreases the ability of cells to adhere to their proper environment. This can help explain the metastasis of tumors in patients suffering from Ewing’s sarcoma. Early life Mary Catherine Beckerle was born in Rivers Edge, New Jersey to Martin and Mickey Beckerle. She is the oldest of three daughters, with sisters Bobby and Jeanne. Her father worked at the New York Telephone Co. and died suddenly at the age of 36 of emphysema.Benson, Lee, “They all want what Huntsman has — The woman in charge”. Deseret News. March 1, 2014. Accessed November 11, 2014. Mary was twelve at the time. Her mother, a registered nurse, worked hard to keep the family together. Mary’s interest growing up included swimming and participation in Girl Scouts. As a teenager, she held jobs in a bakery, in a library, as a lifeguard, and at a Howard Johnson restaurant. Even with all these activities, school always remained Mary’s chief focus. After high school, she attended Wells College, a small all girls’ school in New York, where she earned a B. A. in Biology and Psychology. She graduated magna cum laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.“Mary Beckerle” American Society of Cell Biology. 1994 Before continuing her education, she took a year off and worked in a cellular biology research laboratory at University of Texas Southwest Medical Center. After this, she attended the University of Colorado Boulder where she earned a PhD. in Molecular Biology. Her education then continued at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where she was a postdoctoral fellow in Anatomy and Cell Biology. Personal life While at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Beckerle met David Murrell. She would go on to marry him. The couple shares one son, David, who Mary describes as “my greatest joy in life.” Since moving to Utah, Dr. Beckerle has taken interest in mountain biking and hiking. Career After finishing her postdoctoral research, Beckerle joined the University of Utah faculty as an assistant professor of Biology. She continued teaching at the University of Utah as well research and was one of the first professors to move into the Huntsman Cancer Institute when it opened in 1999. Also in 1999, she was awarded the Ralph E. and Willa T. Main Presidential Endowed Chair in Cancer Research at the University of Utah. Upon moving into the institute, she led a program specializing in cancer cell biology until 2003. In 2003, she was named the deputy director of the center. In 2006, she was named the CEO and the director over the entire Huntsman Cancer Institute. In 2009, she was also named the Associate Vice President for Cancer Affairs at the University of Utah. She holds the Jon M. Huntsman Presidential Endowed Chair at the University of Utah, where she has also been promoted to a distinguished professorship in the biology department. Throughout her career, Beckerle has served on many boards and committees, both within Huntsman Cancer Institute and nationally. In 1990, she served on the editorial board of Molecular Biology of the cell. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the Curie Institute in Paris in 1999. In 2006, Dr. Beckerle served as the president of the American Society of Cell Biology. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. Recently, she has been named to the American Association for Cancer Research Science Policy and Legislative Affairs Committee. She has served in many capacities for the National Institute of Health, both on tasks forces as well as the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director from 2007-2010. She has also served as chair of the American Cancer Society Council for Extramural Grants. Currently, she serves on the Scientific Review Board of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Board of Directors of the American Association for Cancer Research, the Coalition for Life Sciences Board of Directors. She serves on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the National Center for Biological Sciences at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bangalore, and the Mechanobiology Institute of the National University of Singapore. Beckerle serves on numerous National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center External Scientific Advisory Boards, including the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania, and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. In 2013, she was elected to the Board of Directors of the American Association for Cancer Research.Mary Beckerle. Huntsman Cancer Institute Beckerle was elected to the American Philosophical Society in the April 2017 group of inductees that also included Barack Obama. = 2017 Huntsman Cancer Institute Firing and Reinstatement = On 17 April 2017, Beckerle was terminated as CEO and Director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute via an email from University of Utah President David W. Pershing and Senior Vice President for Health Sciences Vivian Lee. The university did not disclose reasons for the dismissal, but members of the Huntsman family issued several public criticisms of the move, and called for Beckerle's reinstatement while criticizing the leadership shown by Pershing and Lee. In subsequent days, members of the family made media appearances, published full page newspaper ads reiterating their support for cancer research and Beckerle, and even called for the termination of top university officials. Beckerle's firing occurred as the University of Utah and Huntsman Cancer Foundation were negotiating terms for a new memorandum of understanding to govern the operations of Huntsman Cancer Institute. Some Huntsman Cancer Institute faculty and staff were among over 3600 individuals who signed a petition requesting Beckerle be restored to her position. On 19 April, roughly 100 demonstrators marched from the Huntsman Cancer Institute facilities across the university campus to the Office of President Pershing, calling for Beckerle's return. This came on the heels of other meetings and protests in the university community. On the morning of 25 April, the university's board of trustees met in a closed session, after which Pershing briefly spoke to reporters, mentioning that an announcement would be forthcoming later in the day. Within a few hours, it was announced that Beckerle would be reinstated as CEO and Director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and would report directly to the University President, bypassing Vivian Lee. On 28 April, Vivian Lee announced via email that, effective the same day, she was stepping down as the university's senior vice president for health sciences, dean of the medical school, and CEO of the healthcare system. Research and Ewing’s Sarcoma Beckerle’s research employs several different techniques to exam signaling problems and cell motility issues. Both of these problems could potentially play a role in the development of Ewing’s sarcoma. Her lab is currently focusing on projects involving: the physiological roles of the motility machinery in normal and transformed cells, cell adhesion events at the cell surface can affect processes that depend on the activity of the cell nucleus, how the cell integrates information from multiple receptors to achieve the appropriate response. Ewing’s Sarcoma is a bone cancer affecting mainly children and adolescents.Ewing Sarcoma. St’ Jude’s Children’s Hospital Tumors of Ewing’ Sarcoma are typically found in the long bones of the legs and arms, or bones in the chest, trunk, pelvis, back, or head.Ewing’s Sarcoma. WebMD Beckerle’s research in this area focuses on a key pathway as believed to be a mechanism by which the cancer cells can spread. Ewing sarcoma occurs due to a chromosomal mutation that causes an atypical protein, known as EWS/FLI, to be present (also called expressed), and that when EWS/FLI is expressed, literally thousands of genes are misregulated, leading to abnormal behavior. Beckerle’s lab found that the EWS/FLI protein disrupted cell adhesion and limited the ability of cells to remain in their normal environment. The EWS/FLI protein is difficult to regulate so Beckerle’s team is focused on an essential regulating protein called lysine specific demethylase (LSD1). Preliminary research has aimed to halt the function of LSD1 to prevent the spread of Ewing Sarcoma cells.

Career Jim Bartko began his career while still a student at Washington State University (Pullman) as team manager of Washington State Cougars football. His first professional job started in 1989 at the University of Oregon as regional director and fundraiser for the Duck Athletic Fund. From 1994 to 1998, he was assistant athletic director at Oregon for the Duck Athletic Fund, and then became assistant athletic director for community and corporate relations at Oregon from 1998 to 2003. From 2003 to 2006, he served as Oregon's associate athletic director for donor relations. In 2006, Bartko returned to the Bay area of his youth to be senior associate athletic director for development at UC Berkeley. But in 2007, Bartko came back to his true home at the University of Oregon where he flourished for seven years as senior associate athletic director. Among other major projects, given his close collaboration for nearly 30 years with Phil Knight, he oversaw the building of the Matthew Knight Arena in 2011 to be home court for the UO's basketball teams. Across sports through those years, according to UO football coach Rich Brooks, \\"he was probably as responsible as anyone in the athletic department’s transition from having nothing to having everything you could ever need. He was in the middle of everything.” \\"He had an outgoing personality that connected with everybody, was very helpful to boosters, and did a great job with communication between everybody on the athletics side and on the university side.\\" In November 2014, Fresno State hired Bartko as athletic director, a position he assumed on January 1, 2015. During his tenure there, he notably hired Jeff Tedford, who became the football coach that turned around the Bulldogs from losing to winning seasons in two years. Bartko's Fresno years ended in November 2017 in the wake of fallout from his going public in January 2017 about a lifelong secret of child sex abuse at the hands of his basketball-coaching priest, which he'd been struggling with for decades until his coping mechanisms, having taken an enormous toll, finally collapsed, metaphorically, during his years at Fresno. Bartko left Fresno in 2018, filing a lawsuit against Fresno State for wrongful termination, and once again returned to Eugene and the University of Oregon as associate director of development, later promoted to senior ambassador for advancement and alumni relations. Personal life Born in Stockton, California, Bartko spent his elementary school years in the Bay Area community of Pinole and secondary school years in Modesto. He graduated from Central Catholic High School in Modesto and then from Washington State University, where he majored in sports administration with a minor in business administration. While growing up in Pinole, from ages 7 to 10, he became one of the altar boys abused early on by the serial predator priest Stephen Kiesle, a secret that he kept for nearly 50 years but finally revealed in 2017 and recounted in his book Boy in the Mirror published in February 2020. On March 16, 2020, Jim Bartko died from complications of surgery after collapsing following a gym workout on March 15, three days after his press conference announcing the release of his book in conjunction with a lawsuit he joined against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland. He had partnered with Oregon's Center for the Prevention of Abuse and Neglect to establish the Jimmy Bartko Child Abuse & Scholarship Fund, to which all proceeds from his book will go. The fund will support students at the UO's College of Education who seek to work with survivors of child sexual abuse, the cause to which he had just begun to dedicate the rest of his working life. He was recently divorced; he leaves a son and daughter as well as his parents and sister.

It is native to Venezuela and Colombia. Description L. verrucosa grows to a length of about and is mainly black or dark brown with a white margin to the dorsal sclerites. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being slightly smaller than females and having a pair of large, usually yellow spots on the pronotum. These are covered by a thin translucent cuticle and have traditionally been thought to be luminescent organs.Vršanský, P. et al. 2012: Light-mimicking cockroaches indicate Tertiary origin of recent terrestrial luminescence. Naturwissenschaften, 99 (9): 739-749. However researchers noticed that when in captivity these cockroaches were fed on carrots, the colour of the spots deepened to orange or even red. On closer examination the surface of the cuticle bears a number of small knobs each bearing a small mechanoreceptor. The upper surface of the spots is partially obscured by a pad of enlarged fat body cells which accumulate carotenoids on a diet of carrots. Insects are unable to synthesize carotenoids and the presence of orange or red spots may indicate a well-fed, fit individual. The researchers found no evidence of light emission but hypothesized that the pigmented spots may play a part in male aggression or mate choice by the female, or may provide warning signals. Distribution L. verrucosa is native to Venezuela and Colombia. Behaviour Both sexes of L. verrucosa have short wings but dwell on the ground and are reluctant to fly. It is mainly nocturnal and hides during the day. It is ovoviviparous, the female giving birth to about twenty dark- coloured nymphs long. Courtship usually starts with the male stimulating the female, first with his antennae then with his palps. He then pursues her, pushes her, tries to climb on her back and raises his wings. She may run away or she may allow herself to be pushed and starts palpating the male's abdomen with her palps, climbs on the male and allows him to grasp her genitalia, dismounts sideways and turns through 180° so that the pair are linked at the tip of the abdomen. Copulation usually lasts for about an hour. Not every courtship resulted in a mating, the female often turns away half way through, or may climb on the back of the male without proceeding to copulation. Unlike other cockroaches such as the Pacific beetle cockroach (Diploptera punctata) and the orange-headed cockroach (Eublaberus posticus), the females are not receptive just after moulting and it is about twenty days later that they become receptive, by which time their cuticle is well-hardened.

Education Derr received an MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, attended The Photography Institute National Graduate Seminar at New York University, and BFA from the Art Academy of Cincinnati. Select works Recent years, Derr has created such works as New Day (2020), which transforms Kenneth Noland's painting into a social experience; the Dionysian (a la Nietzsche) Ball Breaker (2019); Escaping Altamont (2018), a conceptual film inspired by Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward Angel created with the help of 37 locals; Day In, Day Out (2017), a 3-channel video installation of the body in spare, experiential exercises staged in idyllic landscapes that fabricate self-directed escapism; Kiss the Sky (2017) featuring 150 smooches for a sesquicentennial; and a mix of contemporary art and basketball in Dribble (2016). * Falling Gretel Dung Miss Garland Hell Spaces, 2013 **One snippet led on to another so that the 'performance' became a poem of chance, like a literary version of the Surrealist game \\"The Exquisite Corpse.\\" A literal space-time to probe the significance of virtual interconnectivity, underscored more than the contrast between traditional and new ways of interacting. Derr succeeded in uncannily generating many of the consequences for reading, interacting, remembering, and interpreting, precipitated by digital modes of communication. Derr's project recalls the environment of the Net that is also \\"by design an interruption system, a machine for dividing attention.\\" * In My Shoes, 2009–2013 ** Sounds of traffic, insects, and wind intermix with the memories of the shoes' owners being read aloud by the artist. For the viewer, the arrhythmic motion is initially disorienting, akin to vertigo. The viewer becomes an active agent in the process of engaging with and re-creating each memory. * Discovering Columbus, 2011 ** Derr explores the ten towns in the United States named after Christopher Columbus using experimental geography tactics. The ten towns include Columbia (Maryland), Columbia (Missouri), Columbia (South Carolina), Columbiana (Ohio), Columbus (Georgia), Columbus (Indiana), Columbus (Mississippi), Columbus (Ohio), Columbus (Wisconsin), and Washington (District of Columbia). While Christopher Columbus's explorations participated in cataloging the natural world, systemizing knowledge, and classifying peoples, they did so from a single point of view that ignored the beliefs and values of the cultures he encountered. That Derr's undertaking is evocative in this regard of what Foucault called a genealogist is because it too seeks to reveal disjunction and dispersion, disparity and overlay, at the origins of things, of whatever is discovered. Proust thought that \\"the only true voyage of discovery\\" was to see through the eyes of others. What Derr presents us with here is an experience of time \\"retained differently.\\" * In Play, 2007-ongoing ** Derr plays ping-pong with artists and writers in front of the cameras. Participants include Vito Acconci, Vicki Goldberg, Erwin Wurm, Peter Garfield, Martha Buskirk, Gary Metz, Terry Barrett, Cal Kowal, William Anastasi, Patty Chang, Dennis Oppenheim, Dan Graham, Michael Snow, Marcy B Freedman, Kate Gilmore, Thomas Zummer, and Navjotika Kumar. * Chance, 2005-ongoing ** An experiment in geography and psychogeography, these are walk performances with the cameras through cities and capitals worldwide. Viewers' die rolls determine the direction that Derr takes through the streets. Derr dresses in a mirrored suit, and wears four video cameras that capture the scenes from his front, back and sides, as he proceeds on a walk.

Adapted from the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson and interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film covers 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles. Development began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor Elliot Graham starting while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections. Steve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015 to critical acclaim. People close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Winslet won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 73rd Golden Globes, while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, at the 88th Academy Awards.  Plot  In 1984, the Apple Macintosh 128K's voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at Flint Center. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs demands engineer Andy Hertzfeld to fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype Macintosh 512K computer. Jobs rants to marketing executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan – he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise. By 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, NeXT. Before the NeXT Computer launch at the War Memorial Opera House, he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained – he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs \\"musicians\\" like Wozniak. Apple CEO John Sculley demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him. By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses. Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is \\"poorly made.\\" Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.  Cast  * Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs: :Co-founder of Apple Inc. Fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs, but stated that he was more interested in capturing Jobs' essence than his appearance. In regards to how he aimed to depict Jobs, Fassbender stated he aimed to depict Jobs as a \\"somebody who was passionate about his vision\\" as opposed to a cruel person. * Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman: :Apple and NeXT marketing executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she \\"heard about it through a crew member who I happened to be working with [in Australia on The Dressmaker], I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [Hoffman]. Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [producer] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part.\\" Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman \\"has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues.\\" Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender \\"were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass.\\" In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she \\"just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake.\\" Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman \\"did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly.\\" * Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak: :Co- founder of Apple and creator of the Apple II. Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak, let alone knowing he was co-founder of Apple. He met with Wozniak to prepare for the film, specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking. In regard to Wozniak's relationship with Jobs, Rogen stated that \\"his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting. Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines.\\" Wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by Rogen in the film. * Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993 * Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan, Jobs' former girlfriend and Lisa's mother * Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original Mac team * Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, and Perla Haney-Jardine as Lisa Brennan-Jobs, Jobs' daughter (depicted her at different ages throughout the film) * Sarah Snook as Andrea \\"Andy\\" Cunningham, manager of the Macintosh and iMac launches * Adam Shapiro as Avie Tevanian, software engineer for NeXT and later Apple * John Ortiz as Joel Pforzheimer, a journalist for GQ who interviews Jobs throughout the film  Production  = Development = Aaron Sorkin was hired to write the screenplay for the film in October 2011. Sony Pictures acquired the rights to Isaacson's book in October 2011, hiring Aaron Sorkin to adapt it. In November 2011, George Clooney and Noah Wyle (who previously portrayed Jobs in the 1999 TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley) were rumored to be considered for the title role. In May 2012, Sorkin officially confirmed that he was writing the script, and had enlisted the help of Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, for historical accuracy. Sorkin later stated that his screenplay would consist of three 30-minute-long scenes covering 16 years of Jobs' life. Sorkin developed the screenplay around Jobs' relationship with a few key people: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs' \\"right-hand- woman\\" Joanna Hoffman, former Apple CEO John Sculley, original Mac team developer Andy Hertzfeld, and Jobs' first child, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, as well as her mother Chrisann Brennan. Sorkin had a chance to speak with all of them while developing the screenplay, including Lisa (who did not communicate with Isaacson while he was developing his book). However, Sorkin has stated that much of the dialogue is fiction. After Sorkin's completion of the script in January 2014, development on the project began to heat up when David Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film, with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs. However, in April 2014, Fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes. Danny Boyle was then hired to direct, with Leonardo DiCaprio in discussions for the role. In October, DiCaprio exited, with Bale, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper being considered. Sorkin revealed in an interview that month that Bale was once again cast in the role, with Seth Rogen entering negotiations to play Wozniak, and Jessica Chastain being considered for a part. Ike Barinholtz revealed he had auditioned for the role of Wozniak. In November, Bale again left the project, with Michael Fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him, and Scarlett Johansson reportedly being offered a role before Sony put the project in turnaround and Universal Pictures acquired it. Following the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack in December 2014, Sony emails were leaked which revealed casting demands as cause of delay in the film's production. Also revealed in the emails were the details that Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron were at one point met with to discuss potential roles in the film. Natalie Portman entered into negotiations for a role in November 2014, but withdrew from the film in December. Meanwhile, Jeff Daniels began negotiations for a role and Michael Stuhlbarg joined the cast as Andy Hertzfeld. In December, Kate Winslet entered negotiations to star in the film, with Fassbender and Rogen confirmed to star, and Katherine Waterston was cast as Chrisann Brennan. Winslet's participation in the film, playing Joanna Hoffman, was confirmed in January 2015. Daniels was also cast as John Sculley, and Perla Haney-Jardine was cast as Lisa Brennan-Jobs. In February 2015, John Ortiz joined the film to play GQ magazine journalist Joel Pforzheimer. = Filming = De Anza's Flint Center, seen early in the film during dialogue between the fictionalized Jobs and Wozniak. Principal photography began on January 16, 2015, at Jobs's childhood home in Los Altos, California, with additional scenes shot throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Production next moved to Berkeley on January 23–24, 2015 (at La Méditerranée, a restaurant on College Avenue in the Elmwood district). On January 29, 2015, filming continued at Flint Center, De Anza college (the location of the original unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984). In late February, production moved to San Francisco and took place at the Opera House, Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, and the Civic Center. Filming wrapped on April 10, 2015, after an overnight shoot in the San Francisco Bay Area. To distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin Küchler implemented three different film formats: 16mm for 1984, 35mm for 1988, and digital for 1998. They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at Flint Center, De Anza college for the first act combined the graininess of 16 mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an Arri Alexa at the Davies Symphony Hall, incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the iMac and subsequent Apple hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming Steve Jobs as \\"brilliant and challenging at the same time\\", and that the goal was to \\"make sure that the visuals kept up with the words\\", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin. Costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb says the real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of the launches: \\"The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design.\\" Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire \\"felt like I had arrived at [Steve Jobs'] vision, that the person had arrived.\\" Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to \\"give the audience kind of a payoff.\\" = Post-production = London-based studio Union created the film's visual effects. According to editor Elliot Graham, extensive film editing took place even before principal photography was completed. During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with Variety, Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the shot frequency and providing enough \\"visual interventions\\" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as \\"a series of fight sequences\\". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle then chose from during post-production. Graham also said: \\"Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away. He would say 'if I'm with you the whole time, we'll always have the same opinions because we're on the exact same journey.'\\"  Music  Daniel Pemberton composed the music for the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. \\"You have the first act which is analog,\\" Pemberton explains, \\"you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital.\\" For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the Roland SH-1000 and Yamaha CS-80. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the San Francisco Opera House. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section. The soundtrack also features songs by The Libertines, Bob Dylan and The Maccabees. The Maccabees' \\"Grew Up At Midnight\\", the song that played during the film's concluding scene, was reportedly chosen by Danny Boyle himself, who is a fan of the band. Other songs were considered for the final scene, even Pemberton's own score before the song was chosen. The soundtrack was released digitally on October 9, 2015, and in physical format on October 23, 2015.  Release  Steve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015. The movie also served as the closing film for the 2015 BFI London Film Festival, approximately one month before its release in the UK on November 13, 2015. Steve Jobs was released digitally on February 2, 2016, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 16, 2016, and includes feature commentary from Boyle, Sorkin, and Elliot Graham. The physical releases contain a 44-minute making-of documentary, Inside Jobs: The Making of Steve Jobs, chronicling the production of the film.  Reception  = Box office = Steve Jobs grossed $17.8 million in North America and $16.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $34.4 million, against a budget of $30 million. In its opening weekend in limited release, the film grossed $521,000 from four theaters, for a per theater average of $130,250, beating out Sicario ($67,000) for the best average theater gross of 2015. The film began its wide release on October 23, 2015, alongside The Last Witch Hunter, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, Rock the Kasbah, and Jem and the Holograms. Over the weekend, the film was originally projected to gross $11–12 million from 2,491 theaters. However, after grossing just $2.5 million on its first day, it was revised to $7.4 million. It ended up grossing $7.1 million, finishing seventh at the box office. On November 10, 2015, just over two weeks after its wide release, Universal pulled the film from 2,072 theaters in the United States. Variety said the film suffered from fierce competition at the box office, possible public weariness with Jobs and the low profile of Fassbender in the title role, and that the underperformance at the box office could hurt the film's award chances. After his film was pulled from wide release in the U.S., Danny Boyle expressed disappointment at the box office performance of Steve Jobs, while suggesting that Universal expanded the film's release \\"too wide too soon\\" and that the studio's move was \\"arrogant\\". = Critical response = On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 312 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Like the tech giant co-founded by its subject, Steve Jobs gathers brilliant people to deliver a product whose elegance belies the intricate complexities at its core.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 45 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" At CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's \\"electric\\" direction \\"temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study\\" and praised Fassbender in the role, who \\"doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [yet] he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man.\\" Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as \\"a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie.\\" Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives \\"a stunning knockout\\" performance as Jobs in a film that is \\"a kind of talk opera\\", which to some might seem to be \\"Sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B+\\", stating that \\"the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel.\\" He also noted that Boyle \\"drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece.\\" Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, writing that \\"despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place.\\" He blames Sorkin's \\"dominating\\" script, arguing that \\"the dialogue stifles\\" and that \\"the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own.\\" He also feels that while it is \\"Boyle's best film for years,\\" his direction \\"plays second fiddle\\" to a script that verges on a kind of \\"Apple-sponsored hero iWorship.\\" Joe Nocera of The New York Times, who knew Jobs well, took issue with \\"how little the film has to do with the flesh and blood Steve Jobs.\\" Characterizing the movie as pure \\"fiction\\", he went on to say, \\"In ways both large and small, Sorkin − as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs − has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense.\\" = Historical accuracy = Danny Boyle, the film's director, speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, \\"[it] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of the most beautiful things in the world.\\" John Sculley praised Jeff Daniels' portrayal of him, but claims the film misrepresented Apple's success with the Mac, and argues that Jobs was \\"much nicer\\" than depicted. Bill Atkinson denounced the film as \\"not truthful at all. That wasn't his character, and the events didn't happen. You think of Jobs having a reality distortion field. I think of Aaron Sorkin as having ... a history distortion field\\". Atkinson said that \\"the only thing he got right in that movie\\" was the \\"spot on\\" depiction of Hoffman, including her accent and how she \\"tried to rein in Steve from ... making an ass of himself\\". Steve Wozniak (who consulted with Sorkin before he had written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015, that he does not \\"talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated.\\" Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not \\"think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others.\\" He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: \\"It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it.\\" In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he \\"was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [....] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right.\\" In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: \\"In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie.\\" Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull was critical of the film's portrayal of Jobs, stating that he was kinder than how he was depicted. Edwin Catmull, president of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios, felt that Jobs would \\"be appalled\\" at his depiction in the film, arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Catmull commented, \\"When [Jobs] left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic hero's journey: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed.\\" In a Bloomberg West interview with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it \\"a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character study of a really complex man. Aaron [Sorkin] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it.\\" Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a \\"small role but professionally done.\\" The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, even though she was not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that \\"the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry- pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person.\\" = Accolades = Steve Jobs has received dozens of industry and critics awards. The film garnered four Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor for Fassbender, Best Supporting Actress for Winslet, Best Screenplay for Sorkin, and Best Original Score for Pemberton. It won two, for both Winslet and Sorkin. On February 14, 2016, Winslet won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Both Fassbender and Winslet received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress.

Development Work began in 1956 on development of a fully tracked armored personnel carrier (APC) to equip the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, with two prototypes being completed by Komatsu (the SU-I) and by Mitsubishi (the SU-II) in 1957. These two prototypes were evaluated against the American M59. They were followed by a second series of 11 prototypes, including both APCs and carriers for 81-mm and 107-mm mortars, with a third series of four prototypes being completed and tested in 1959. Initial production orders were placed in 1959, and the type was standardised in 1960 as the Type 60 Armored Personnel Carrier. About 430 were built. Description The Type 60 had a welded steel hull, with a sloped Glacis plate and vertical hull sides and rear. It was operated by a crew of four (driver, bow gunner, commander and gunner). The driver sat at the front-right of the hull, with the bow gunner, armed with a single 7.62 mm M1919 Browning machine gun sitting to his left. The commander sat behind and between the bow gunner and driver, while the gunner sat behind and to the right of the commander, operating a 0.5 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun mounted of the vehicle's roof. Six troops were carried in a compartment at the rear of the hull, accessed by two doors at the back of the vehicle. Some Type 60 APCs were fitted with two KAM-3D wire-guided anti-tank missiles on the rear of the hull. The vehicle was powered by a Mitisubishi 8 HA 21 WT V8 diesel engine mounted behind the bow gunner. Its tracks were fitted with five road wheels, with a drive wheel at the front and an idler wheel at the rear. Torsion bar suspension was fitted. No night vision equipment or NBC protection was fitted. The vehicle could ford to a depth of . Service The Type 60 was superseded by the Type 73 Armored Personnel Carrier from 1974, but only 225 Type 73s were built, and the Type 60 continued in large scale use until the 2000s. Roles included training, with several Type 60s being modified to visually resemble the Soviet BMD-1 airborne infantry fighting vehicles. 303 Type 60s were listed as in service in 1998, with 33 remaining in service in 2005, but none were listed as in service in 2006.

Landscape Ecology, 15(7), 643-659 While most temperate rainforests around the world have retained only a fraction of their historical range, these forests maintain the majority of their former range and almost all of their historical biodiversity. The region is also notable for having what has become the last remaining large tract of viable habitat for the critically endangered Amur tiger and Amur leopard. History Maximovka valleyThe Russian Federation contains one sixth of the world’s land mass and around half of the country’s territory is what could be considered continuous wilderness, with large expanses of boreal forests providing relatively untouched habitat for an extremely wide diversity of species. The temperate rainforests are located at the intersection of the Pacific tectonic plate and the Eurasian continent’s plate in far southeastern Russia, forming an area with a unique set of characteristics seen no where else in the world.DellaSala D. 2011. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press During the last glacial maximum, the area was not glaciated, allowing for the development of a complex ecosystem containing species with origins in Siberia’s boreal forest and Manchuria’s subtropical forests. Historically these forests ranged from the southeastern Pacific coast of Russia, North Korea, and into northern China, however large amounts of human development (in China especially) has limited the forest to its current range in the Russian Far East. In 2001, UNESCO recognized a 1.5 million hectare area of forest in the central part of the Sikhote-Alin mountains as a World Heritage Site in Russia, citing the area as one of the most unique and valuable areas of intact forest in the world Central Sikhote-Alin.

The mountains have a maximum height of 1850 m, while the average elevation within the range is around 1000 m. The major rivers include the Ussuri, which acts as the western border with China and empties into the Amur river, which in turn flows northeast to empties into the Sea of Okhotsk. The Bikin and Iman rivers act as tributaries to the Ussuri, flowing west from the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. Sikhote-Alin mountain range in winter Climate Known as the \\"Ussuri taiga,\\" this region of Russia has long, cold winters and fairly mild summers to go along with a mean precipitation of 800–1000 mm per year. During the summer and fall, a monsoonal influence brings tropical storms and typhoons coming from the southeast, resulting in substantial rainfall. Fog occurs as a result of difference in temperatures between the continent and the ocean, resulting in more moderate temperatures, higher humidities; helping to prevent substantial water loss from occurring due to evapotranspiration. Continental winds coming in from Siberia bring cooler, dry air during winter, resulting in lighter precipitation (30–50 cm of snow). Winters can be long and bitterly cold with January mean temperatures ranging from -15 to -20 °C and snow covering the forest floor from October to April.Kobayashi, M. A. K. O. T. O., NEMILOSTIV, Y.

Eurasian Journal of Forest Research, 10(1), 51-58, The driest parts of the year are from April to June and September to October, which also happen to coincide with the greatest threat of forest fire. Species The forests fall in the transition zone between two biomes: the southern Asian hardwood forest and the northern coniferous forest.Cushman, S. A., & Wallin, D. O. (2002). Separating the effects of environmental, spatial and disturbance factors on forest community structure in the Russian Far East.

A Gmelin larch (Larix gmelini) stand in the Russian Far East The forest is a mix of broadleaf and conifer, with the forest type becoming more conifer dominated at higher elevations and more broad-leaf-conifer mixed at the lower elevations and within valleys. The most common species include the Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) and Manchurian fir (Abies holophylla) at the lowest elevations and coastlines. Jezo spruce (Picea jezoensis) and Khingan fir (Abies nephrolepis) are common species to be found from 700–1400 meters. Other tree species include Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), silver birch (Betula platyphylla), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), trembling aspen (Populus tremula), Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), Erman's birch (Betula ermanii), and Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii), a deciduous conifer common throughout, but dominant in the northernmost reaches of the forest The Amur region of Russia holds the last remaining habitats for the critically endangered Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and Manchurian sika deer. It has been estimated that there are less the 600 tigers.Carroll, C., & Miquelle, D. G. (2006).

This region also happens to be some of the last of habitat of the Blakiston’s fish owl (Bubo blakistoni); along with being the world’s largest owl, it is unique in the way that it eats fish (primarily Masu salmon) and relies on old growth forests along river banks to hunt, nest, and breed.WCS Study: Huge Trees Help Huge Salmon-Eating Owl.

Common ungulates include red deer, roe deer, wild boar, Manchurian moose, and musk deer. Korean pine and Jezo spruce mixed forest along the Bikin River. Forest structure and disturbances Fire and logging constitute the primary disturbances in this area, both of which are occurring at an increasing frequency. Illegal logging practices, along with a political climate more favorable to multinational logging corporations has drastically increased the amount of timber taken per year. The occurrence of Korean pine in dominant forests has been declining as more common and more intense wildfires start to take their toll on the species, limiting its ability to recover and changing areas that were once dominated by old growth Korean pine to Mongolian oak and birch forests. Above 700–800 meters in altitude, the forest type transitions from broadleaf to coniferous, dominated by Jezo spruce and Manchurian fir. The further to the north, the altitudinal gradient decreases with the increase in latitude, resulting in coniferous forests at sea level at 47° N latitude. Conservation Under the USSR control, conservation strategies focused on the creation and a network of strictly protected nature reserves, called zapovednik and partially protected wildlife refuges, called zakaznik. These conservation strategies were largely successful and well maintained, as 85 zapovedniks and 26 national parks remained within Russian control after the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Following the break up, a period of economic hardship has ensued in Russia, resulting in conservation funding cuts and increases in illegal logging and poaching, casting serious doubt on the viabilities of the protected areas and the many rare and endemic species that they contain.Dinerstein, E., Krever, V., Olson, D. M., & Williams, L. (1994). An emergency strategy to rescue Russia's biological diversity. Conservation Biology, 934-939 Amur (Siberian) tiger Conservation policies have been falling from federal control down to a regional level, which creates funding and enforcement challenges, but also allows for a more grass-roots, bottom up approach to conservation, which despite the challenges has seen some success. Much of the recent funding for conservation studies and implementation of legislation comes from donors and organizations in the United States, where investing in conserving the biodiversity in the Russian Far East is seen as a good economic investment. At a species level, Korean pine is a highly valued type of timber, and although the logging of the species is restricted, illegal logging practices thrive due to a lack of enforcement. Korean pine forests also receive the most interest when it comes to conservationists, as they have been found to have the highest densities of tigers and their prey. Because of this, it appears that the longevity of the temperate rain forests in the Russian Far East will most likely depend on the success of the habitat conservation efforts for the endangered species found there, particularly those for the Amur tiger.

The cantata is in three movements: # Auf, Brüder! auf: men's choir and vocal quartet, horns and trombones (bars 1 to 27) # Wohl ist's die Liebe: the vocal quartet a cappella (bars 28 to 69) - Langsam, gemütlich # Heil unserm Vater: mixed choir, wind instruments (bars 70 to 169) - Heiter The cantata, the second of three larger-scale occasional compositions,C. Howie,Chapter II, pp. 22-23 is Bruckner's first extended composition for large wind ensemble and choir. The first verse, which expresses a male point of view, introduced by a solo horn, is set for men's voices with instruments in a comparable register (horns and trombones). The text of the second movement, which projects a gentle, thoughtful mood, is sung with smaller forces a cappella. The words of the final stanza, which are highly celebratory, introduced by the trumpets, is using the whole tessitura of voices with a large set of wind instruments. The solo horn recalls the introductory motive, providing a musical unity. This cantata may be the first work, in which Bruckner's personal style is clearly recognisable.W. K.

Biography  At 15 years of age and took drawing classes at the night shift at the School of Fine Arts, where admitted as a regular student two years later. His teachers Roberto Pizano, Domingo Moreno Otero, Pedro A. Quijano, Francisco Antonio Cano and Coriolanus Leudo. On his own initiative he began work on The Ballad of Viceroy Solis, his first picture book manuscript done in watercolors. At that time, said Trujillo Magnenat, there were few museums in Colombia; and there were no galleries or exhibitions, neither art critics. Support for the artists from the government and private enterprise did not exist. In 1932 he begins to make illustrations for the literary section of the newspaper El Tiempo and the magazine Mundo al día. He works in ceramics and photography with Carolina Cárdenas, who died a few years later and in whose honor he creates the oil painting Death and the Maiden, one of his most famous paintings and considered, altogether with Women on clubs as one of the most important works of Colombian twentieth century paintings. Toi et moi, is his second book manuscript with illustrations in watercolors and texts in ink and gold, with marked influence from art deco movement. He was appointed director of the Department of Decorative Arts School Fine Arts Bogotá. And as director of publications of the Ministry of National Education. The cover of Cantique de cantiques du roi Suleiman (Song of Songs of Solomon) was made in tin embossed with inlaid ceramic, and the pages made them, just like those in Toi et moi by his own hand by calligraphic transcription of the texts, \\"decorating and illuminating the capital letters with details using the aesthetics characteristics of medieval manuscripts but with his own stroke of a modern painter. In addition, each manuscript contains several of his drawings that recreate scenes and feelings evoked in songs or poems.\\"Sergio Trujillo Colombian graphic designers In the First Annual Hall Colombian Artists wins the silver medal with the works Pastora, Anunciación y Composición (Death and the Maiden). At the Second Annual Exhibition he won the gold medal with the oil Portrait of Mrs. Sara Dávila Ortiz, his wife. The Sleeping Beauty, watercolor on cardboard. Magnenat Sergio Trujillo (1932). Trujillo Magnenat, a multifaceted artist, disciplined and refined, had great humanistic education. He belongs to the generation of the pioneers of modern art in Colombia, who distinguished themselves away from the rigor of the classic rules and have achieved an art of their own. He was attentive to the international innovative spirit that the Bauhaus drove with its motto: \\"art and technique: a new unity\\". As the art curator Carmen María Jaramillo says, the mass dissemination of the work of art could be one of the fundamental objectives of Trujillo and a common denominator, both of Colombian art of the period, with its growing interest in the mural, and the tendency to recover and reassess the applied arts which allow to create art objects within reach of the common man and not just the specialized collector. This became evident since he started illustrating the main newspapers and magazines in Colombia, and illustrated books, from children's stories and booklets to history textbooks and poetry. Without realizing it, he made art a common good, which raised the quality of life of people through murals done in public places and in factories; lithographies which adorned public schools across the country; design of furniture, lamps, tiles and toys; and the production of posters for cultural and sporting events, such as those made for the Bolivarian Games that were held in 1938, in Bogotá. In these posters, were stylized figures stand as well as a particular handling volumes and a new sense of abstraction, the precision of the artist is revealed and unfolded, so that critics and historians have recognized him as one of the most versatile in our history. In outlining the dynamics of athletes speed of movement, he shows a fundamental characteristic and influence of Italian Futurism. This type of works along with the covers made for the magazine America and the literary supplement for El Tiempo, in addition to his work in the Revista de las Indias and the children's magazine Rin Rin made him the pioneer of professional graphic design in the country, and perhaps the most important Colombian poster for decades. This versatile artist draws attention thanks to his paintings of elongated figures and balanced color. With his vigorous and prolific appearance enriched the Colombian art world and among critics has been recognized his skillful, dynamic, and precise line, making it stand out for a great artist. For his literary and artistic training, said the writer Germán Arciniegas, Trujillo departed from the Spanish tradition and tended to go along with the French illustrators. \\"The sharpness of his drawings is spent by Renaissance filters and has that agility and good taste who always carry him to look in beautiful women the elegant postures and dance steps, or to recreate with a firm and tender line the strength of men and women that fight and dream, the revolts, the Quixotes of all times.\\" Carmen María Jaramillo emphasizes \\"his innovative air, its clear and consistent sense that art is a common good and a way to raise the daily life of people. Although he denies the validity of the avant-garde, his work has been completely modernist. He wants to break with tradition and propose to the aesthetics that characterized the academic art alternatives. His work is eclectic, can not be enrolled in any 'ism'. Trujillo is affirmed by the uniqueness of his work and without typecasting himself, does not remove what is seen, lived and felt in his time.\\"Dibujos Sergio Trujillo Magnenat in the MAMBO In the words of art critic Germán Rubiano, \\"within his generation, Sergio Trujillo Magnenat is an island figure. And it is because his work is too varied to limit it to very precise objectives, and as is nationalistic in his oils and watercolors of savanna and coastal landscapes or its many illustrations of the country's history, and as it has sought to reach the people through several murals and countless drawings published in books, magazines and newspapers, also abounds in family portraits, ideals (or long remembered) figures; religious affairs and scenes of world history, particularly in his murals and illustrations.\\" There are other paintings with references to \\"tenebrismo\\", \\"claroscuro\\", the pointillism, the post-impressionism, symbolism, cubism, art of Ancient Egypt and especially in his work a lot of art-deco, but always with his particular stamp. His versatility allowed him to capture landscapes and cityscapes that were either oil or watercolor, and make family and friends portraits in charcoal, pencil and ink. Unlike the Impressionists, he used to take notes on the geographical location where he was, and later he embodied, from memory -photographic memory- the light and colors that he had seen. He also recreated, through painting, myths and legends, and ventured into surrealism in the 70s. Art critics have found in him an Americanism style of the type of the Mexican artist Orozco and Siqueiros. In his way, he recreated the murals of the battle of the \\"Pantano de Vargas\\" and the history of the Independence General José Hilario López. In 1994, at the Museum of Modern Art, a retrospective exhibition of the works of Trujillo occupied three rooms: the most complete and meaningful retrospective of his work. He died in Bogotá, Colombia, in 1999.  Personal life  Married to Sara Davila Ortiz, had six children Carolina Trujillo, Maria Cristina Trujillo, Maria Clara Trujillo, Jaime Trujillo, Sergio Trujillo, and Alberto Trujillo.

Its FAQs page gives an address for service of legal process with an agent Incorp Services in Westlake Village, California, but there is no evidence that the company physically conducts business in California. The incorporation documents filed in California give an address for a registered office in Troy, Michigan but this may just be a mailing address. A Cayman Islands address also appears on the incorporation documents but this appears to be a vacation property. The website is registered with an agent Domains by Proxy based in Scottsdale, Arizona but this is just a provider of web hosting services. The corporate filing dated 30 August 2018 lists three company officers, Rob Laidlaw, Diane Yu and Vincenzo Bellissimo, all of whom appear to be based at 111 Peter Street Suite 901, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5V 2H1. This is the same address as the parent company VerticalScope Inc, and some 2km away from the Toronto Star office at 1 Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5E 1E6. It is likely that the actual business of the company is conducted from one or both of these offices.

The body of the object may be hard- paste porcelain, developed in China in the 7th or 8th century, or soft-paste porcelain (often bone china), developed in 18th-century Europe. The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on lead-glazed earthenware such as creamware or tin-glazed pottery such as maiolica or faience. Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous biscuit or bisque. Underglaze decoration may then be applied, followed by glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be painted with overglaze decoration and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze. Most pieces use only one of underglaze or overglaze painting, the latter often being referred to as \\"enamelled\\". Decorations may be applied by brush or by stenciling, transfer printing, lithography and screen printing. Porcelain painting was developed in China and later taken up in Korea and then Japan. Decorated Chinese porcelain from the 9th century has been found in the Middle East. Porcelain for trade with this region often has Islamic motifs. Trade with Europe began in the 16th century. By the early 18th century European manufacturers had discovered how to make porcelain. The Meissen porcelain factory in Saxony was followed by other factories in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries. Technology and styles evolved. The decoration of some hand-painted plates and vases from the 19th century resembles oil paintings. In the later part of the 19th century china painting became a respectable hobby for middle-class women in North America and Europe. More recently interest has revived in china painting as a fine art form. Technical aspects =Paste= Vintage Royal Worcester bone china The Chinese define porcelain as a type of pottery that is hard, compact and fine- grained, that cannot be scratched by a knife, and that resonates with a clear, musical note when hit. It need not be white or translucent. This porcelain is made of hard paste that mainly consists of kaolin, or china clay. The clay is mixed with petuntse, or china stone. The glaze is prepared from petuntse mixed with liquid lime, with less lime in the higher-quality glazes. The lime gives the glaze a hint of green or blue, a brilliant surface and a sense of depth. Hard-paste porcelain is fired to temperatures of . Soft-paste porcelain was invented in Europe. Soft-paste porcelain made in England from about 1745 used a white-firing clay with the addition of a glassy frit. The frit is a flux that causes the piece to vitrify when it is fired in a kiln. Soft-paste porcelain is fired to . The kiln must be raised to the precise temperature where the piece will vitrify, but no higher or the piece will sag and deform. Soft-paste porcelain is translucent and can be thinly potted. After firing it has similar appearance and properties to hard-paste porcelain. The use of calcined animal bones in porcelain was suggested in Germany in 1689, but bone china was only produced in Britain, with the first patent taken out in 1744. Bone china was perfected by Josiah Spode (1733–1797) of Stoke-upon-Trent in England. The basic formula is 50% calcined cattle bone, 25% Cornish stone and 25% china clay. The stone and clay are both derived from granite. The stone is a feldspathic flux that melts and bonds together the other ingredients. The bone gives the ware strength and helps it keep its shape during firing. The resulting material is strong, white and translucent, and resonates when struck. It is fired at a medium temperature, up to , which gives it a much better body than soft-paste objects with a glassy frit. The firing temperature is lower than for true porcelain, so more metal oxides can retain their composition and bond to the surface. This gives a wider range of colors for decoration. 18th-century Delftware showing Chinese scenes Earthenware pottery including tin-glazed pottery, Victorian majolica, Delftware and faience, is made of clays or earths that give a soft paste. Earthenware is opaque, with a relatively coarse texture, while porcelain is semi-transparent, with a fine texture of minute crystals suspended in a transparent glassy ground. Industrial manufacturers of earthenware pottery biscuit-fire the body to the maturing range of the clay, typically , then apply glaze and glaze-fire the piece at a lower temperature of about . With very vitreous (glass-like) bodies the manufacturer may spray on the glaze. Bone china is treated in this way, glaze-fired at a lower temperature after biscuit firing to about . With stoneware and porcelain the body is usually biscuit fired to , and then glost or glaze fired to . Because the glost temperature is higher than the biscuit temperature, the glaze reacts with the body. The body also releases gases that bubble up through the glaze, affecting the appearance. The same techniques are used to paint the various types of porcelain and earthenware, both underglaze and overglaze, but different pigments are used due to the different body characteristics and firing temperatures. Generally earthenware painting uses bolder, simpler designs, while china painting may be finer and more delicate. Ming dynasty plate with underglaze decoration =Underglaze painting= Traditional porcelain in China included painting under the glaze as well as painting over the glaze. With underglaze painting, as its name implies, the paint is applied to an unglazed object, which is then covered with glaze and fired. A different type of paint is used from that used for overglaze painting. The glaze has to be subject to very high temperatures to bond to the paste, and only a very limited number of colors can stand this process. Blue was commonly used under the glaze and other colors over the glaze, both in China and in Europe, as with English Royal Worcester ware. Most pieces use only one of underglaze or overglaze painting. Underglaze painting requires considerably more skill than overglaze, since defects in the painting will often become visible only after the firing. During firing even refractory paints change color in the great heat. A light violet may turn into a dark blue, and a pale pink into a brown-crimson. The artist must anticipate these changes. With mazarine blue underglazing the decoration is typically fairly simple, using outline extensively and broad shading. The Japanese were known for their skill in depicting flowers, plants and birds in underglaze paintings that used the fewest possible brushstrokes. =Overglaze painting= 18th century Chinese porcelain with underglaze blue, overglaze enamels. Mounts are 19th century French. Overglaze china paints are made of ground mineral compounds mixed with flux. Paints may contain expensive elements including gold. The flux is a finely-ground glass, similar to porcelain glaze. The powdered paint is mixed with a medium, typically some type of oil, before being brushed onto the glazed object. The technique is similar to watercolor painting. One advantage of overglaze china painting compared to oil or watercolor is the paint may be removed with a slightly wetted brush while the color is still moist, bringing back the original ground. Pieces with overglaze painting are often referred to as \\"enamelled\\". Open mediums do not dry in the air, while closed mediums do. An artist may prefer a medium that stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains somewhat sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse together in a single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist can add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface. The artist may begin by sketching their design with a china marker pencil. When the painted object is fired in a kiln, the china marker lines and the medium evaporate. The color particles melt and flatten on the glaze surface, and the flux bonds them to the glaze. At sufficient heat the underlying glaze softens, or \\"opens\\". The color is strongly bonded to the glaze and the surface of the finished object is glossy. =Mechanical approaches= Transfer printed bowl, Abbey pattern, Petrus Regout, Netherlands, 20th century Stenciling was in use in the 17th century. A pattern is cut out of a paper form, which is placed on the ceramic. Paint is then dabbed through the stencil. Transfer printing from engraved or etched copperplates or woodblocks dates to around 1750. The plate is painted with an oil-and-enamel pigment. The surface is cleaned, leaving the paint in the cut grooves. The paint is then transferred to \\"potter's tissue\\", a thin but tough tissue paper, using a press. The tissue is then positioned face-down over the ceramic and rubbed to transfer the paint to the surface. This technique was introduced for both underglaze and overglaze transfer in Worcester in the mid-1750s. Lithography was discovered in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with a greasy crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by the grease. Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on the grease. Paper is then pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from the grease, thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies. A multicolored print could be made using different blocks for different colors. For ceramics, the print was made onto duplex paper, with a thin layer of tissue paper facing a thicker layer of paper. A weak varnish was painted on the ceramic surface, which could be slightly curved, then the duplex paper pressed onto the surface. The tissue paper was soaked off before firing. Later techniques were developed to photographically copy images onto lithograph plates. The technique, with its ability to transfer fine detail, is considered most suitable for onglaze decoration, although it has been used for underglaze images. The roots of natural sponges were used in Scotland to make crude stamps to decorate earthenware pottery in the 19th century and early 20th century. Rubber stamps were introduced in the 20th century to decorate porcelain and bone china with gold lustred borders. Screen printing was first introduced in Japan in the early 18th century, said to be the invention of Yutensai Miyassak. The early Japanese version was a refinement to stenciling that used human hairs to hold together parts of the stencil, such as the outside and center of a circle, so that visible bridges could be eliminated. Eventually the technique evolved to use fine screens, with some areas blocked by a film and some lines or areas left open to allow paint to pass through. Techniques were developed to transfer images to screens photographically. The process was in use for ceramics by the mid-20th century, and is now the main way of decorating ceramics. It can be used to print curved shapes such as mugs with underglaze, onglaze, glaze, wax resist and heated thermoplastic colors. Decals provide another mechanical method of transferring an image to a ceramic object. Asian porcelain =China= Possibly, as some authors claim, porcelain was already being made during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) in an attempt to make vessels similar to the glass vessels that were being imported from Syria and Egypt at the time. Certainly porcelain was being made in China in the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Over the years that followed the quality of the porcelain, the design and decoration became extremely refined. The pieces were thin and finely made, with subtle glazes, and later with elaborate painted decorations. The Chinese began exporting porcelain to Asia and the Near East in the 9th century. By the time of the Song dynasty (960–1279) the porcelain makers had achieved a high level of skill. Some experts consider their work to be unsurpassed in its purity of design. The Ding kilns in northern China began production early in the 8th century, where they produced sophisticated and beautiful porcelains and developed innovative kiln stacking and firing techniques. Ding ware had white bodies, and typically had an ivory-white glaze. However, some Ding ware had monochrome black, green and reddish brown glazes. Some were decorated with the sgraffito method, where surface layers were scaped away to expose a ground with a different color. Jingdezhen was among the first porcelain manufacturing centers in the south of China, with ready access to kaolin and petunse. In its day it was the world's most important center of porcelain production. Jingdezhen ware includes the famous decorated Qingbai pieces with shadow-blue glazes. Under the Yuan dynasty the use of underglaze cobalt blue decoration became popular. During the Ming dynasty (1369-1644) production of blue and white and red and white ceramics peaked. The Jingdezhen artisans developed and perfected use of overglaze enamels in the second half of the 15th century. They excelled in their floral, abstract or calligraphic designs.

During the Goryeo period (918–1392) there was high demand for Chinese porcelain, and Korean potters used the imports as models. Distinctively Korean designs had emerged by the end of the 12th century, and the white porcelain of the reign of King Sejong of Joseon is quite unique. In 1424 there were 139 kilns in Korea producing porcelain. In 1592 Japan invaded Korea and took four hundred potters as prisoners to Japan. The Korean porcelain industry was destroyed while the Japanese industry boomed. The 1636 Manchu invasion caused further damage. The industry recovered and produced new forms with white or white and blue glaze. In the late 19th century the loss of state support for the industry and the introduction of printed transfer decoration caused the traditional skills to be lost.

In the mid-17th century the Japanese found a growing market from European traders who were unable to obtain Chinese porcelain due to political upheavals. Brightly- coloured Japanese export porcelain made around the town of Arita were called Imari porcelain ware by the Europeans, after the shipping port. Porcelain only painted in underglaze blue is traditionally called Arita ware. The craftsman Sakaida Kakiemon developed a distinctive style of overglaze enamel decoration, typically using iron red, yellow and soft blue. Kakiemon-style decorations included patterns of birds and foliage, and influenced designs used in European factories. The very refined Nabeshima ware and Hirado ware were not exported until the 19th century, but used for presentation wares among Japan's feudal elite.

Others say the use of cobalt blue as a pigment for painting pottery was developed in the Middle East, and adopted in China for painting porcelain. However, this has been disputed, since the earliest Middle-Eastern pottery with cobalt blue decoration, from Samarra in Iraq in the 9th century, has Chinese shapes. At that time the potters in the region did not have the technology to make high-fire underglaze porcelain. It appears that the white glazed pottery with blue decoration was in imitation of imported porcelain from China. Chinese porcelain was prized by wealthy people in the Middle East from the time of the Tang dynasty. A large collection from the Ottoman sultans Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent is held by the Topkapı Palace museum in Istanbul. Another large collection of 805 pieces of Chinese porcelain, donated to the Ardabil Shrine by Shah Abbas I of Persia in 1607–08, is now held in Tehran's National Museum of Iran. Blue and white Chinese porcelains from the 14th to 16th centuries have also been found in peasant houses in Syria. Often the porcelain was designed for the market, with decorative designs that included prayers and quotations from the Koran in Arabic or Persian script. Large amounts of Ming porcelain had also been found in Iraq and Egypt, and also in Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, India and East Africa. =European exports= Grill family in the 1700s In the 16th century the Portuguese developed a limited trade in commonplace blue-and-white ware manufactured in China. In 1604 the Dutch captured a Portuguese carrack with about 100,000 porcelain items. These were auctioned at Amsterdam in August 1604 to buyers from across Europe. Over the period from 1604 to 1657 the Dutch may have brought 3,000,000 pieces of porcelain to Europe. Political upheavals then cut off most of the trade of porcelain from China until 1695. The Japanese began to produce ware for export in 1660, but the supply was uncertain. Trade with China reopened at the end of the 17th century, but the Dutch had lost their monopoly. A French ship reached Canton in 1698, and an English ship in 1699. In the years that followed large quantities of porcelain manufactured in China for trade purposes were imported to Europe, much of it in English ships. Jingdezhen production expanded to meet the demand for export porcelain. The Jesuit François Xavier d'Entrecolles wrote of Jingdezhen in 1712, \\"During a night entrance, one thinks that the whole city is on fire, or that it is one large furnace with many vent holes.\\" The European traders began to supply models to show the manufacturers the form and decoration they required for tableware items unfamiliar to the Chinese. The French Jesuits provided paintings, engravers, enamels and even the painters themselves to the Imperial court, and these designs found their way into porcelain decoration. Colorful enamel paints, used in German tin-glazed pottery, gave rise to new techniques such as famille rose coloring in Chinese porcelain. Designs of European origin found their way onto many porcelain items made in China for export to Europe. At least 60 million pieces of Chinese porcelain were imported to Europe in the 18th century. European manufacture Medici porcelain bowl A first attempt to manufacture porcelain in Europe was undertaken in Florence, Italy in the late 16th century, sponsored by Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The \\"Medici porcelain\\" did not contain china clay, and was only made in small quantities. In the late 17th century Louis Poterat tried to manufacture porcelain at Rouen, France. Little of this has survived. Tea drinking became fashionable in Europe at the start of the 18th century, and created increasing demand for Oriental-style porcelain. =Germany= The Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden in Saxony was the first to successfully manufacture hard- paste porcelain in Europe. Painted porcelain wares that imitated oriental designs were being produced after 1715. Johann Joachim Kändler (1706–75) was the most famous sculptor at Meissen, creating vigorous models of figures and groups. The pieces had bright glazes and were painted in enamels with strong colors. Meissen's processes were carefully guarded from competitors. The secrets gradually leaked out, and factories were established in Prussia and at Vienna by the 1720s. After Saxony was defeated in the Seven Years' War (1756–63) the methods of making porcelain became widely known. By the late 18th century there were twenty-three porcelain factories in Germany. The Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory in Munich was renowned for its delicate modeling and fine decoration.

In France, soft-paste porcelain was produced at Saint-Cloud from the 1690s. The Saint-Cloud painters were given the license to innovate, and produced lively and original designs, including blue-and-white pieces in the Chinese style and grotesque ornaments. A factory for white tin-glazed soft porcelain was founded at Chantilly around 1730. Many of its pieces was based on Kakiemon designs, using the Kakiemon colors of iron red, pale yellow, clear blue and turquoise green. Soft-paste porcelain was also made at Mennecy-Villeroy and Vincennes-Sèvres, and hard- paste porcelain was made at Strasbourg. Vincennes-Sèvres became the most famous porcelain factory in Europe in the later 18th century. It was known for its finely modeled and brightly colored artificial flowers, used to decorate objects such as clocks and candelabra. The factory at Sèvres was nationalized in 1793 after the French Revolution. After 1800 it stopped producing soft- paste and standardized on an unusually hard type of hard-paste using china clay from Saint-Yrieix, near Limoges. The factory produced many different painted designs for decoration. Later in the 19th century the art director Théodore Deck (1823–91) introduced manufacture of siliceous soft-paste pieces. The factory could make large objects that did not crack or split, and that could be decorated in rich colors due to the low firing temperature.

The painter and mezzotintist Thomas Frye (1710–62) produced fine bone china at his Bow porcelain factory in East London. Bone china was also made at Lowestoft, at first mainly decorated in underglaze blue but later with Chinese-style over-glaze that also included pink and red. Josiah Spode (1733–97), who owned a factory in Stoke-on-Trent from 1776, was a pioneer in use of steam-powered machinery for making pottery. He perfected the process for transfer printing from copper plates. His son, Josiah Spode the younger, began making fine bone china around the end of the 18th century, adding feldspar to the china body. The Spode porcelain was often embossed and decorated in Oriental patterns. The \\"willow pattern\\" is thought to have been introduced about 1780 by Thomas Turner of the Caughley Pottery Works in Shropshire. It takes elements from various Chinese designs, including a willow tree, a pair of doves, a pavilion and three figures on a bridge over a lake. Spode and Thomas Minton both manufactured printed blue-and-white pottery with this pattern. James Giles The Worcester Porcelain Company was established in 1751, mainly producing high-quality blue underglaze painted china. At first the decorations were hand painted. Around 1755 the factory introduced overglaze transfer printing, and in 1757–58 introduced underglaze blue transfer printing. Robert Hancock (1730–1817) executed the copper plates and developed the process of transfer printing. Japanese-inspired designs were introduced in the late 1750s. Overglaze hand-painted polychrome decoration was also produced by \\"the best painters from Chelsea etc.\\", or by independent decorating shops such as that of James Giles (1718–80). In the 1770s designs were often inspired by the Rococo style of early Sèvres pieces, including exotic birds or flowers on solid or patterned backgrounds. The company introduced a harder paste and harder, brighter glaze after 1796. Between 1804–13 the partner Martin Barr, Jr. was responsible for production of superbly painted ornamental vases with landscapes or designs of natural objects such as shells or flowers. Josiah Wedgwood (1730–95) came from a family of potters. In 1754 he formed a partnership to make earthenware pottery, and became interested in coloring. He invented a rich green glaze for use in leaf and fruit patterns. He established his own pottery in Burslem in 1759, which prospered. His jasper ware is normally classed as a fine stoneware, but is similar to hard porcelain. In 1805 his company began to make a fine hard-paste porcelain in small quantities. Some of this was richly painted in floral designs and gilt. In 1836 Mr. John Martin testified before a select committee of the British House of Commons on Arts and Manufactures. He considered that china painting was in decline in his country and no original designs were being produced. French work was much higher in quality, perhaps due to government support. He did acknowledge that Wedgwood ware, made from the commonest materials, could be beautiful works of art. However, he preferred plain ware to poorly decorated ware. During the later Victorian era in Britain the Arts and Crafts movement popularized one-of-a-kind, hand- crafted objects. Commercial potteries such as Royal Doulton and Mintons employed young women with artistic talent to create hand-painted or hand- colored art pottery. Until as late as 1939, women in the ceramic industry in Britain were mostly confined to decorating, since they were thought to have special aptitude for repetitive detailed work. The trades' unions did what they could to handicap women even in these occupations, for example refusing to allow them to use hand rests. Often the women were used for subordinate tasks such as filling in outlines or adding decorative sprigs.

The latter factory was transferred to Madrid in 1759 when Charles became king of Spain. Modeled figures were often not decorated, or were painted in subdued pastel colors. Porcelain was manufactured in Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia. The Imperial Porcelain Factory at Saint Petersburg made soft- and hard-paste porcelain, and flourished under Catherine the Great. It featured neoclassical designs with dark ground colors and antique-style cameo painting, including reproductions of engravings of Russian peasants. In 1803 the factory was reorganized by Alexander I, who introduced new products such as large vases with elaborate enamel paintings that were often very similar to oil paintings.

This followed the establishment by Mintons of a pottery painting studio in Kensington that provided employment for female graduates of the nearby National Art Training School. Howell & James opened a gallery in Regent Street where they put on annual china painting exhibitions judged by members of the Royal Academy of Arts. China painting also became popular in America. It was acceptable since it resembled other \\"parlor crafts\\" such as watercolor and glass painting. At first, men dominated the field of china painting as an artform. Thus Edward Lycett, who had learned his art in the Stoke-on-Trent potteries of England, moved to America where, \\"the only place where painting of the finer kind was being done as a regular business was at Mt. Lycett's wareroom; and here many ladies resorted to study the methods employed and the materials required.\\" H.C. Standage wrote in Letts's Household Magazine in 1884, For the duration of the china painting craze, between about 1880 and 1920, many books on pottery making, focusing on painting, were published for the amateur in England and America, for example, A Handbook to the Practice of Pottery Painting by John Charles Lewis Sparkes, Headmaster of the National Art Training School and director of the Lambeth School of Art. Sparkes mentioned the tin-enamel of the Moors and of Gubbio and lustre ware (not the province of the amateur) and the work of William de Morgan. His book, published by a supplier of artists' materials, carried many adverts for colours and pottery blanks, brushes and teachers of pottery painting. Wheeler's Society of Decorative Art in New York taught pupils to paint simple floral motifs on ceramic tableware. The more talented and experienced china painters could move on to painting portrait plaques. Some women were able to develop professional careers as independent china painters. Rosina Emmet (1854–1948), sister of Lydia Field Emmet, became well known for her ceramic portrait plaques, with characteristic Aesthetic-style treatment. The portraits were either made from the live sitter or from a photograph. One portrait of a young girl that has survived was painted on a white glazed earthenware blank from Josiah Wedgwood & Sons. It is finely detailed, from the background of patterned wallpaper to the details of lacework and individual strands of hair, giving a realistic effect in the English tradition. Porcelain factories in France, Germany, England and the United States produced plates, bowls, cups and other objects for decoration by china painters. In 1877 McLaughlin recommended the hard French porcelain blanks. The \\"blanks\\" were plain white, with a clear glaze, and could be fired several times. Their price varied depending on size and complexity of the object's molding, ranging from a few cents to several dollars. The china painter could buy commercially produced powdered colors of mineral oxides mixed with a low-temperature flux. Some manufacturers sold paints pre-mixed with oil. Parliament Buildings and Ottawa River by Martha Logan from the 1897 Canadian Historical Dinner Service In her 1877 A Practical Manual for the use of Amateurs in the Decoration of Hard Porcelain, the American Mary Louise McLaughlin dismissed the preconception that several firings were needed when the work included a variety of colors. She admitted that this could be desirable in porcelain factories, but it would not be practical for amateurs. McLaughlin always prepared her work for a single firing, using a technique similar to watercolors to finish the painting. At that time an amateur could obtain a small muffle furnace that could be used for small pieces. However, she recommended having the firing done by a professional, which would probably be safer, faster and cheaper. Often the amateur artist could take their work for firing to the same shop where they bought their colors and blanks. In 1887 the ceramic artist Luetta Elmina Braumuller of Monson, Massachusetts launched The China Decorator, A Monthly Journal Devoted Exclusively to this Art. The magazine found a ready market, with many subscribers in the US, Europe and other countries. It became recognized as the authority on all aspects of china painting, and continued to be published until 1901. An 1891 editorial in The China Decorator lamented the number of unqualified teachers who had failed to spend the six months or a year needed for a thorough artist to acquire reasonable knowledge of china painting techniques. The writer estimated that among the tens of thousands of professional and amateur china painters in the US there were at most 500 competent decorators. China decoration by amateurs was popular in America between about 1860 and 1920. As the practice declined, the artists were encouraged to make their own designs and to learn to throw pots. Those who succeeded were among America's first studio potters. Evolving styles and attitudes Faience bowl from Zittau, 1663, with typical outlined design Overglaze decorations of earthenware, Faience or porcelain were traditionally made with carefully outlined designs that were then colored in. Later designs represented flowers, landscapes or portraits with little overpainting or blending of the colors. In the 20th century china painting techniques became more like oil painting, with blended colors and designs in which attention to light gives three-dimensional effects. More recently a style more like watercolor painting has become more common. For many years china painting was categorized as a craft, but in the 1970s feminist artists such as Judy Chicago restored it to the status of fine art. In 1979 Chicago wrote, Chicago spent a year and a half studying china painting. She became intrigued by the effort that amateur women had put into the undervalued art form. She wrote, \\"The china-painting world, and the household objects the women painted, seemed to be a perfect metaphor for women's domestic and trivialized circumstances.

On 15 May 1905 his name was changed to Niels Nielsen Kjær in accordance with a royal authorization. In addition to being a member of the Hvidsten group Kjær was also a radio mechanic or radio dealer. The group helped the British Special Operations Executive parachute weapons and supplies into Denmark for distribution to the resistance. In March 1944 the Gestapo made an \\"incredible number of arrests\\" including in the region of Randers where a number of members of the Hvidsten group were arrested. The following month De frie Danske reported that several arrestees from Hvidsten had been transferred from Randers to Vestre Fængsel.

This phenomenon has been observed on over 200,000 hectares of forest and is believed to be due to reduced winter snowpacks and increased soil freezing.USFS Website, \\"Climate Change and Yellow-Cedar Decline\\" Setting Yellow cedar ranges from the Klamath Mountains of California to Prince William Sound in Alaska.Schaberg et. al., \\"Do Limited Cold Tolerances and Shallow Depth of Roots Contribute to Yellow-Cedar Decline?\\" Forest Ecology and Management 262. 2011. Web Limited to higher elevations throughout most of its natural range Hennon et al. \\"Climate Warming, Reduced Snow, and Freezing Injury Could Explain the Demise of Yellow- Cedar in Southeast Alaska, USA\\". World Resource Review. 2006. Web The climate in Southeast Alaska and western British Columbia is hyper-maritime, with frequent low-intensity precipitation. Snow levels in this area are highly variable due to near freezing temperatures in the winter time. Forests here are dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea stichensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), shore pine (Pinus contorta), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and yellow cedar. Decline of this species has affected over 200,000 hectares of forest in Alaska and 50,000 hectares in British Columbia Causes It is currently generally accepted that increased regional temperature and associated reduction in snow-pack depth and duration are some of the drivers behind yellow-cedar decline. However, other causes of decline are being investigated by researchers. Current evidence suggests that yellow-cedar decline is not biologically driven or caused by direct anthropogenic pollution or atmospheric pollution.Hennon et al. \\"Did Climatic Warming trigger the onset and development of yellow-cedar decline in Southeast Alaska?\\". European Journal of Forest Pathology. 24 (1994) 399-418. Researchers have investigated the effects of soil saturation and soil chemistry on yellow-cedar declineD'Amore et al. \\"Evaluation of soil saturation, soil chemistry, and early spring soil and air temperatures as risk factors in yellow-cedar decline\\". Global Change Biology (2006). and have yet to reveal any conclusive data, other than the fact that these parameters may indirectly influence cedar mortality. Elevation also seems to play a role in cedar decline, as it was found in one study that yellow cedar trees growing above 130 meters were more cold hardy than those growing below 130 meters. =Freezing injury= Yellow-cedar decline began in about 1880 which coincides with a warming of the climate after the Little Ice Age. The mechanics of this process are still hypothetical, but evidence suggests that soil exposure to cold temperatures due to lack of canopy cover or wetness of soils can lead to freezing injury of yellow cedar. Open canopy conditions in the forest expose soils to freezing temperatures. As regional temperatures warm, precipitation falls as rain more often than snow in the winter. Snow packs in the winter offer some insulation to root systems from freezing, the absence of this snow pack allows for soil freezing. As soils freeze, root tissues, especially those in wet soils, suffer damage and can lead to tree mortality. Yellow cedar is found to be significantly less cold hardy than tree species surrounding it, such as the western hemlock, which was found to deharden at almost 13 °C less than the yellow cedar in comparable conditions. Management and conservation Management and conservation of yellow cedar in light of its declining state could be divided into three management areas: the maladapted, the persistent, and migration.Hennon et al, \\"Shifting Climate, Altered Niche, and a Dynamic Conservation Strategy for Yellow-Cedar in the North Pacific Coastal Rainforest\\". Bioscience Volume 62 No 2. 2012. Maladapted being those areas in which yellow cedar will lose in competition with resident and exotic species. Persistent being those ecosystems in which yellow cedar has managed to compete with resident species that will require special attention for maintenance. And migration being those areas which are suitable, but do not presently contain yellow-cedar populations. =Maladapted= It is very important to recognize that conservation and restoration in areas that are maladapted for yellow cedar are futile. Areas that have already been maladapted for yellow cedar are important as sources of economic value. Dead regions of yellow cedar are still available for harvest even 80 years after death. Harvest of these areas represent a large opportunity for wood resources, shifting from logging of healthy yellow cedar in suitable habitat to those in maladapted regions could be beneficial to the conservation of this species. It seems that, following the decay of yellow cedar, western red cedar will succeed the dead forest. The red cedar offers many of the very same economic and ecological values as yellow cedar. Areas of lower elevation in Southeast Alaska and British Columbia that have seen yellow-cedar decay have been succeeded by red cedar. However, more research will need to take place as this problem persists to evaluate the economic and ecological value of subsidizing red cedar in these areas. =Persistent= Areas that are predicted with future climate change models to be suitable for sustained yellow-cedar habitation could be considered persistent from a management standpoint. It is important to accurately model these areas in order to develop effective management strategies. At a landscape level, areas with well-drained soils are most likely to host yellow cedar into the future. These are the areas that see the highest rates of production among trees in the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest, and are thusly the areas that are targeted for timber harvest. For this reason, these areas are hotspots for active management of yellow cedar into the future, as they represent the main areas that are able to achieve conservation goals. =Migration= Some conservationists propose that assisted migration into areas uninhabited by yellow cedar will be an effective management strategy. Assisted migration is the introduction of species and genotypes into areas that are projected to be suitable for those species/genotypes. This can be controversial, mainly because it is seen as introducing invasive species into ecosystems, which could bring undesirable results. Researchers have attempted the introduction of yellow cedar in areas that it does not grow, but are within its range. A trial planting in Yakutat, Alaska, yielded first-year survival rates of over 90%, meaning that targeted migration can be used as an effective management strategy.

It assumes that each domain influences the others. HWS thus complements and overlaps with Medicine 2.0 (medicine enabled by emerging technologies).McHattie LS, Cumming G, French T. Transforming Patient Experience: Health Web Science Meets Medicine 2.0 Med 2.0 2014;3(1):e2 URL:http://www.medicine20.com/2014/1/e2 DOI: 10.2196/med20.3128. Research has uncovered emergent properties that arise as individuals interact with each other, with healthcare providers and with the Web itself. History HWS began at the Web Science Curriculum meeting in the summer of 2010 at the University of Southampton where approximately forty scholars came together to discuss the subject. That was followed by a foundational Workshop in Koblenz 2011 under the aegis of ACM. The dialogue to more precisely define HWS as a sub-discipline of Web Science began among Web-oriented investigators at the 2012 Medicine 2.0 Conference and was formalized in 2013. This nascent discipline of Health Web Science is further described and developed in the monograph \\"Health Web Science\\". A call to action at the ACM Web Science workshop asked the community to consider how to accelerate the discipline. In particular, beyond the available knowledge-gathering technologies (e.g. blogs, social-medicine portals, experience mining, graph theory, network analysis, and game theory), what additional is required to deal with the Health Web's emergent properties? For example, what is needed to curate, interrogate, and visualize the combination of both 'Big Data' – arising from the increasingly pervasive sources and sensors including \\"the Internet of things, the quantified self, smart cities, and smart homes – and smaller-scale data arising from individual patient conversations, self-reporting, and self- exploration? How are small-scale innovations safely and efficiently scaled up to the size of the Web and scaled out to millions of patients?Gillam et al.

One research group argued for technologies that enable predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory (P4) medicine. Other stated needs include an \\"Expert Patient\\" capable of making sense of online medical information in a personal context, tools to cope with information overload through e.g., text mining and semantic technologies, in particular through algorithm-aided decision making. = Health web observatory = At the Medicine 2.0 European meeting in 2014, the case was made for the need to design bespoke health web observatories.

Along with Margarete Müller and Margot Honecker she was one of a small number of women to reach the higher ranks in the country's power structure. She was the leader of the Women Department of the Central Committee of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). She played a central role in liberalising East German Abortion laws. Ingeburg Lange (1982) Life =Early years= Inge Lange was born into a politically conscious family in Leipzig, as Ingeburg Rosch. Her father was Alfred Rosch (1899-1945), a Communist Party activist. While she was still a young child, the reality of post-democratic Germany came to her home when her father was arrested for transporting illegal (political) books and, for a period, imprisoned in 1935/36. Ingeburg secured a training as a dressmaker between 1943 and 1946. In 1945 she became a member of Antifascist youth in the Großzschocher quarter of Leipzig. =Politics= In 1945 she joined the Communist Party (KPD). Following the forced merger, in what was becoming the German Democratic Republic, of the KPD and the SPD (party), this left her, in 1946, as a member of the newly formed Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Specifically, between 1946 and 1961 Lange had a succession of positions within the ruling SED party's youth wing, the Free German Youth ( FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend). =Teaching and youth work= She undertook a teacher training course in 1946/47 after which she became an assistant at the Antifascist School at Königs Wusterhausen. In 1947 she became a teacher at the North-west Youth School in Mutzschen. Between 1947 and 1949 she was Secretary, and then in 1950 First Secretary with the regional Free German Youth organisation at Wismut SAG, the tightly controlled (on behalf of the Soviets) and strategically critical uranium mining operation near the Czechoslovak border. =National politics= Between 1948 and 1950 Lange belonged to the Wusmut region leadership of the country's ruling SED party and was a member of its secretariat. In 1950/51 she served as Second Secretary of the FDJ executive for the greater Berlin region. From May 1952 till December 1961 she worked as the Secretary to the Central Council of the FDJ.Andreas Herbst, Winfried Ranke, Jürgen Winkler: So funktionierte die DDR. Lexikon der Organisationen und Institutionen. Abteilungsgewerkschaftsleitung (AGL) – Liga für Völkerfreundschaft der DDR. Reinbek bei Hamburg 1994, rororo 16348, , page 302 Between September 1951 and July 1952 she studied at the Komsomol Lenin Academy in Moscow, which can be seen as a mark of appreciation from Moscow for a difficult job well done during her time at Wismut. Between 1955 and 1961 she undertook a correspondence course at the prestigious Karl Marx Academy, which led her to a degree in Social sciences. =Abortion law= In August 1961 Ingeburg Lange succeeded Edith Baumann and Hilde Krasnogolowy as head of the Party Central Committee working group and department concerned with women. In the Women Commission set up by Walter Ulbricht controversy was generated by the theme of women's ability to take decisions for themselves regarding their bodies. This in effect was the so-called abortion debate that was also a political theme in western politics at the time, but underpinned in East Germany by a desperate labour shortage caused by the scale of male deaths in the war and compounded by the massive emigration of working age citizens from East to West Germany in the decade before the inner German border was fortified. The East German abortion law was eventually passed on 9 Match 1972. Unusually for East Germany, the parliamentary vote was not unanimous 14 members voted against the new law which for the first time gave women the right, during the first twelve weeks of a pregnancy, to choose to have an abortion. Another aspect of the legislation was free distribution of the contraceptive pill. There were those who opposed 1972 Abortion legislation both in the medical profession and in the churches. Although the legislation is generally seen as Inge Lange's achievement, it would not have come about without powerful support from other influential members of the East German political elite, notably Margot Honecker whose husband took over as the East German national leader a year or so before the law was passed. Women's place :\\"Never before have we women lived in a state of which we can truly say that it owns our hearts, our knowledge and our deeds, but that is our state.\\" :::::Inge Lange addressing the Politburo (1969) :„Noch nie zuvor haben wir Frauen in einem Staat gelebt, von dem wir wahrhaft sagen können, daß ihm unser Herz, unser Wissen und unsere Tat gehören; denn das ist unser Staat.“ :::::Inge Lange addressing the Politburo (1969)'' =Further political promotions and appointments= She sat as a member of the National legislature (Volkskammer) from 1952 till 1954 and then from 1963 till 1989. Between 1963 and 1967 she was a member of the assembly's committee for Industry, Construction and Traffic, and from 1971 deputy chair of the Committee for Work and Social policy. In 1963 Lange was nominated as a candidate for membership of The Party central Committee. Progression from Central Committee candidature to membership often took many years, but Inge Lange progressed to Central Committee membership rapidly, being appointed in early December 1964.Neues Deutschland 6 December 1964 With the German Democratic Republic collapsing, on 8 November she resigned from the Central Committee of the party's politburo, but she was then selected as a candidate for the replacement politburo. The entire central committee then resigned on 3 December 1989. On 21 January 1990 she was one of those expelled from The Party, which was now in the process of mutating into the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism). After this she withdrew from public life. =Death= Inge Lange died in a Berlin hospital on 13 July 2013.
