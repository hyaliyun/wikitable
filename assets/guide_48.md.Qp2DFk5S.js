According to English Heritage it was built in the 16th century with 19th and late 20th century additions. It is a former gentry house and was not built as an inn. Until well into the sixteenth century droving on any scale in the Marches was far too risky. In such a lonely and lawless area, cattle rustling was rife, often by the authorities themselves. The Land of Speis means simply land of thorn bushes, which it is. The name is still in use today. Abbey Cwm Hir was always a modest house, the monks were predominately Welsh and apart from the Abbey's officers would have little occasion to leave it. There are two bars with an open fire, a bar menu and a restaurant. Accommodation all with views over the Wye Valley. The Inn is 4 star rated by the AA and has a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence. As of 2018 the restaurant also has an AA Rosette rating.  History of the building  The proprietors' web site asserts that the Rhydspence Inn was probably always a hostelry. the building dating from 1380 with extensions built in the 17th and 20th centuries. Although no records document these claims, the style of building, size and location suggest the original inn was built for travellers and pilgrims on the medieval route from Abbey Cwmhir to Hereford Cathedral (now part of the Cistercian Way). The land between Rhydspence and Pencesty was called 'La Speys' and was attached to Abbey Cwmhir, which was located about north of Llandrindod Wells. Comparison with similar buildings suggests the inn was built by the Vaughn family of Hergest; of whom the best known for his infamous deeds is Thomas, The Black Vaughn. He is said to haunt Kington church by riding his charger down the nave dressed in full armour. The house was originally of a hall house design, being two-storey at one end and a large open hall area with central open fire, it had a thatched roof. Changes have taken place over the centuries and it is now two storeys throughout with a stone tile roof. In 1590, two generations after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the tenant was Thomas Watkins, and it is likely that at this time the ecclesiastical hostelry had become a stopover for the Welsh and Irish drovers. The Rhydspence became the main assembly point for cattle on the 'Black Ox Trail' (the origins of Lloyds Bank) with beasts coming on drovers roads from Southern Ireland, South and Mid Wales.  Origin of the name  Attached to the inn were some of land and it is probable that from this time that the inn gained the name Rhydspence. Rhyd means 'River Crossing', not necessarily a bridge, in this case a ford as the inn is located near to a point where the River Wye can easily be forded, in summer at least, furthest east along the river and free from toll. Spence is possibly a corruption of 'Pence' as the land was split into penny, Halfpenny and Farthing Fields; these were let to the drovers to rest and revitalise the livestock before forming herds for the drive to the English cities and markets as far as London.  Drovers  There are many stories about the Drovers, whose role existed for a period of three to four hundred years. Experiments with shoeing cattle, leather boots for sheep and bitumen on the feet of geese are often mentioned. Initially a 'herd' would have been about 12 cattle every day to London because only 12 cattle were required at Smithfield market. Similarly herds would be dispatched daily to Oxford, Gloucester, Worcester and the like. A small herd was not likely to be entirely lost to Highwaymen and no cash was carried. Hence the reference to the early origins of Lloyds Bank as monies could be transferred along the trail 'on the hoof' with minimum risk and this was the origin of today's Lloyds Banking Group in Wales (formerly The Bank of the Black Ox but now known as the Bank of the Black Horse). In later years the herds became bigger and eventually a railhead with stockyards was built in Kington and the Rhydspence was no longer needed by the cattle trade. Today the Offa's Dyke Path, the Cistercian Way and the Wye Valley Walk pass close by the inn.  Location  The Rhydspence Inn is on the English side of the Welsh Border, the stream in the garden marks the divide. To the east are the rolling fields of England, dotted with the famous timber framed Black and white villages of Herefordshire. To the west lie the hills and mountains of Wales including the Brecon Beacons. Twenty miles into England stands the city of Hereford with its modern shopping centre and ancient cathedral. The cathedral houses two treasures which any visitor to the area must see, the fabulous medieval world map the Mappa Mundi and an extraordinary Chained Library of priceless medieval and Anglo Saxon manuscripts. Twenty miles into Wales stands the town of Brecon and its cathedral. Dwarfed by the mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park, this is unrivalled walking country. Our nearest town is Hay-on-Wye, the 'Town of books'. Hay boasts dozens of facilities. Antiquarian booksellers, from the tiny to the world's largest. Even the castle ruins have been pressed into service as a book shop!  Past owners  A Buskin Shirley and a William Colley were the owner and innkeeper from 1783. A ten shilling 'Licence for the Purveying of Liquor' was issued in 1830 to a John Morris, proprietor and John Watkins, owner. Sarah Ann Clark, the landlady and wife of Philip Clark was murdered in 1880. Her ghost is said to haunt the inn; allegedly she is very friendly and only appears when there are young children staying at the inn. The Rhydspence continued into the 1950s as an inn and farm when the land was sold off and the Inn progressed from an alehouse into the hotel and restaurant of today. Peter and Pamela Glover owned and ran the Rhydspence since from 1986 until 2012. Paul and Geraldine Ashley were at the Rhydspence between July 2012 and January 2016. The Inn was purchased from Peter Glover at the beginning of 2016 by Mark and Lowri Price and has been operated by them since.

This model is on display at the main building of the ETSIIM in Madrid, Spain The concept of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley, lever, and wheel. Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects. The term engineering itself has a much more recent etymology, deriving from the word engineer, which itself dates back to 1325, when an engine‚Äôer (literally, one who operates an engine) originally referred to \\"a constructor of military engines.\\"Oxford English Dictionary In this context, now obsolete, an \\"engine\\" referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). The word \\"engine\\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning \\"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\\"Origin: 1250‚Äì1300; ME engin < AF esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, ¬© Random House, Inc. 2006. Later, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineeringEngineers' Council for Professional Development definition on Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Includes Britannica article on Engineering) entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of military engineering (the original meaning of the word \\"engineering,\\" now largely obsolete, with notable exceptions that have survived to the present day such as military engineering corps, e. g., the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers). Ancient era The ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the pyramids and Pharos of Alexandria in ancient Egypt, cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Acropolis and Parthenon in ancient Greece, the aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum in the Roman Empire, Teotihuac√°n, the cities and pyramids of the Mayan, Inca and Aztec Empires, and the Great Wall of China, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient civil and military engineers. The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water- lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza. The earliest architect known by name is Imhotep. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djos√®r, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (a Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630-2611 BC. He may also have been responsible for the first known use of columns in architecture. Kush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy. Reservoirs in the form of Hafirs were developed in Kush to boost irrigation.Fritz Hintze, Kush XI; pp.222-224. Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns.Kushite ancestors built speos between 3700 to 3250 BC.Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the Meroitic period. The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC. Ancient Greece developed machines both in the civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known model of a mechanical analog computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering. Chinese and Roman armies employed complex military machines including the Ballista and catapult. In the Middle Ages, the Trebuchet was developed. Middle Ages The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.Ahmad Y Hassan, Donald Routledge Hill (1986). Islamic Technology: An illustrated history, p. 54. Cambridge University Press. . The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D. , web page, accessed on line 23 October 2009; this web page refers to Ahmad Y Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo.Ahmad Y. Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, p. 34-35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. The crankshaft and camshaft were invented by Al-Jazari in Northern Mesopotamia circa 1206,Georges Ifrah (2001). The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer, p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (See ) and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls. The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al- Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.Professor Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari, was the first programmable analog computer.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184, University of Texas Press, Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64‚Äì9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) Al-Jazari built five machines to pump water for the kings of the Turkish Artuqid dynasty and their palaces. Besides over 50 ingenious mechanical devices, Al-Jazari also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, escapement mechanisms, clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods. European Renaissance The first steam engine was built in 1698 by mechanical engineer Thomas Savery. The development of this device gave rise to the industrial revolution in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of mass production. With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering. The following images are samples from a deck of cards illustrating engineering instruments in England in 1702. They illustrate a range of engineering specializations, that would eventually become known as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, geodesy and geomatics, and so on. Each card includes a caption explaining the purpose of the instrument: File:Four of hearts Sea quadrant 1702.jpgFour of hearts: Sea quadrant File:1702 Nine of diamonds Dyals.jpgNine of diamonds: Dyals (dials) File:Six_of_diamonds_Circumference.jpgSix of diamonds: Circumferentor File:Eight of diamonds the compass.jpgEight of diamonds: the Compass File:King of spades- spheres.jpgKing of spades: Spheres File:Knave of hearts Surveying wheel and chains 1702.jpgKnave of hearts: Surveying wheel and chains File:Knave of spades Leavell 1702.jpgKnave of spades: Leavell File:One of Diamonds Mathematical instruments 1702.jpgOne of diamonds: Mathematical instruments File:Queen of Diamonds Projections of the sphere 1702.jpgQueen of diamonds: Projections of the sphere File:Queen of spades Astronomical quadrant (ca. 1702).jpgQueen of spades: Astronomical quadrant File:Three of diamonds Gauger 1702.jpgThree of diamonds: Gauger (gauges) File:Two of clubs Theodolet and semi circle 1702.jpgTwo of clubs: Theodolet and semi-circle Modern era The inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer James Watt gave rise to modern Mechanical Engineering. The development of specialized machines and their maintenance tools during the industrial revolution led to the rapid growth of Mechanical Engineering both in its birthplace Britain and abroad. The discipline of Electrical Engineering was shaped by the experiments of Alessandro Volta in the 19th century, the experiments of Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric motor in 1872. Electrical engineering became a profession late in the 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and USA. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. The work of James Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of Electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of Electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other Engineering specialty. Chemical Engineering, like its counterpart Mechanical Engineering, developed in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants. The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes. Aeronautical Engineering deals with aircraft design while Aerospace Engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach envelope of the discipline by including spacecraft design.Imperial College London England: Studying engineering at Imperial: Engineering courses are offered in five main branches of engineering: aeronautical, chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical. There are also courses in computing science, software engineering, information systems engineering, materials science and engineering, mining engineering and petroleum engineering. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the turn of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, the 1920s saw extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of World War I military aircraft. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments. The first PhD in engineering (technically, applied science and engineering) awarded in the United States went to Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S. In 1990, with the rise of computer technology, the first search engine was built by computer engineer Alan Emtage.

The gas created a massive fire that caused major forest damage and killed 3 people. Back then, Gerald Baron was a communications contractor for Equilon Enterprises (a joint venture between Texaco and Shell), which was the managing partner for the Olympic pipeline. He was responsible for communicating with the public and the press to assure them that the crisis was contained. This demanding task inspired him to create The PIER System‚Äîa single system that could streamline the communication problems that organizations face during major disasters by providing the tools they need to distribute information. Baron said ‚ÄúWe just saw that there were better ways of solving the communication problem that would really facilitate what needed to be done.\\" - Gerald Baron, 1999 In 2003 PIER Systems, Inc. corporation name was changed to AudienceCentral, Inc. The name was changed back to PIER Systems, Inc. in 2007. = Clients = *On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Louisiana. During this time, the United States Coast Guard 8th District, used The PIER System as their means of contact with press and the media. Although they were operating in a facility with no electricity, coast guard officers were able to upload pictures and news updates via cell phone modem to the USCG PIER System website‚Äîwhich then allowed the information to be distributed to media outlets across the country. The USCG 8th District website received more than 2 million visits from people searching for updates and information about affected victims of the tragedy. The USCG's public affairs team also used PIER to manage, track, and respond to hundreds of inquiries and requests. *On June 28, 2008 during the 2008 California wildfires the United States Forest Service and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Calfire) responded to 1,400 simultaneous wildfires in the Northern California region. At that time their local system was down and they were in need of a mass communication and notification tool. They contacted PIER Systems to create a control center website to be used for communications between the 22 different regional response teams. Within an evening, PIER Systems had created a website and had communications running. The organizations used The PIER System continually for internal and external communication throughout the duration of the fires. *In September 2008 in response to Hurricane Ike, 12 major organizations including Harris Country Metro, Port of Houston, Marathon Oil, Motiva Port Arthur Refinery, BP, the USCG, and campuses of the University of Houston (TX), used The PIER System as their way of communicating with employees, families, students, press, the media. *On April 24, 2010, the company registered the domain name deepwaterhorizonresponse.com for use by BP and the United States Coast Guard in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.http://www.networksolutions.com/whois- search/deepwaterhorizonresponse.comhttp://greeneconomypost.com/epa-web-bp-oil- spill-9688.htm ReferencesExternal links *PIER Systems Official site *Regroup Mass Notification Category:Software companies established in 2000 Category:Companies based in Bellingham, Washington Category:Software companies based in Washington (state) Category:Software companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 2000 ","title":"PIER Systems"},{"id":"20734278","text":"Old Friendship United Methodist Church is a historic United Methodist church located in West Post Office, Worcester County, Maryland.

She is a survivor of the Holocaust and has published many books about her experiences in the Second World War.http://www.bucknell.edu/x30900.xml  Early life  When Inge was just 7 years old, she was deported with her parents to the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia. When they arrived, everything they had with them was taken, except for the clothes they were wearing, and Inge's doll, Marlene. Conditions in the concentration camp were very harsh. People were sick and hungry. Potatoes were considered to be as valuable as diamonds. Food was scarce in the camp, Inge was hungry, scared and sick most of the time. Her parents always tried to do what they could for her, with the circumstances they were faced with. For her eighth birthday, her parents gave her a tiny potato cake with a little bit of sugar; for her ninth birthday, an outfit sewn from rags for her doll; and for her tenth birthday, a poem written by her mother.  Life  Inge Auerbacher was the last Jewish child born in Kippenheim, a village in South-Western Germany located at the foot of the Black Forest, close to the borders of France and Switzerland. She was the only child of Berthold (1898‚Äì1987) and Regina Auerbacher (n√©e Lauchheimer, 1905‚Äì1996). Both of her parents came from observant Jewish families who had lived for many generations in Germany. Inge's father was a soldier in the German Army during World War I. He was wounded badly and consequently awarded the Iron Cross for service to his country. Inge's father was a textile merchant and the family owned a large home in Kippenheim. On November 10, 1938, her father and grandfather were arrested and taken away during the chaos of Kristallnacht (Night of the Broken Glass) and sent to the Dachau concentration camp. Inge, her mother, and her grandmother were able to hide in a shed during Kristallnacht and were not harmed. A few weeks later Inge's father and grandfather returned home, but her grandfather died shortly after in May 1939 of a heart attack. Auerbacher spent part of her childhood between the years 1942‚Äì1945, when she was sent to a concentration camp. A total of 140,000 people were shipped to Theresienstadt concentration camp near Terezin; 88,000 were sent primarily to the gas chambers in Auschwitz, and 35,000 died of malnutrition and disease in Terezin. Of the 15,000 children imprisoned in Terezin, Inge and her parents were among the 1% that survived. The Red Army rescued Auerbacher's family on May 8, 1945. After a short stay at G√∂ppingen, the family immigrated to New York City in May 1946. Seven years later Auerbacher obtained US citizenship.http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/idcard.php?ModuleId=10006364 She graduated from Queens College and spent 38 years working as a chemist. In 1986, Auerbacher published her first book about her childhood memories. It was called I Am A Star. She is the author of six books, including three memoirs about her experiences in Terezin and recovering after the war, and the subject of a play, \\"The Star on My Heart,\\" which premiered in Ohio in November 2015. Inge tells her life story in three books; \\"I am a Star\\"- Child of the Holocaust, \\"Beyond the Yellow Star to America\\" and \\"Finding Dr. Schatz\\" These books are about her experiences throughout the Holocaust. These published books are a part of Inge's great accomplishments throughout her life. In the book \\"I am a Star\\"- Child of the Holocaust, Ingle explains how here life changed once the Nazis invaded. She goes into detail about how all Jews, among her, were required to wear a yellow star on all of their clothing. Moving forward into the book, Ingle explains what it was like in the Concentration Camps. She explains how it was terrible, and they slept on wooden beds altogether. She goes further into detail explaining how awful the food was. Breakfast only consisting of cold coffee and bread, lunch having only cold soup, if any lunch at all, and lastly dinner, which was bread and cold soup. Due to the lack of food many people starved to death.

It was constructed in 1927 and is a two-story, three-bay building of brick laid in stretcher bond. The interior reflects an extensive Art Deco style redecoration carried out in 1937 including narrow silver columns on either side of the stage and embellishments on the side walls. It is currently operated as a performing arts center. One of the few remaining links to Pocomoke's past is the Mar-Va Theater. Its name is representative of its location, since the theater is located in Maryland, only a short distance from the Virginia state line. With originally 720 seats, the Mar-Va is the largest theater south of Wilmington, Delaware, which has never been altered. Once used as a vaudeville theater complete with stage facilities, dressing rooms and orchestra pits, the Mar-Va was played by many famous performers, which included some old-time cowboys such as Tom Mix, Roy Rogers, Hop-a-Long Cassidy and Smiley Burnett. Linda Lavin of the television show \\"Alice,\\" David Ogden Stiers, a musician and actor well known for his role in M*A*S*H, and Scars on 45 have recently visited/performed. Mr. & Mrs. Frank Barlett of Berlin, MD built the Mar-Va Theater in 1927. Made from the finest materials, it has been estimated that it would probably cost around $250,000 by present economic standards. The Mar-Va Theater is one of the few theaters on the shore to boast of a draw drape. The sidewalls have the original gold embossed paneling and the projectors, which were added around 1943, are of the carbon arc variety. The balcony was once used for segregation purposes. It had its own entrance, concession area, box office and bathroom. The seats in the balcony were considered the best in the theater. The theater opened on December 1, 1927 with John & Lester Fox managing the theater while J. Dawson Clarke played the piano for the old silent movies. In 1949, after the death of John Fox, J. Dawson Clarke and Orville Mason bought the theater and in 1967, the ownership went to Dawson and his wife, Hattie. When the theater originally opened, ticket prices were 10 cents. At the time of its closing in 1993, a ticket cost $3.50. Soda pop, sold in the soda parlor next door, once cost 10 cents and popcorn was always sold for 10 cents a bag. Currently, the theater shows movies on the first and third weekends on the month and has live performances on a regular basis. Admission for movies is $5 per person and the annual Christmas play's admission is $15 per person. 2011's performance was \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

Life Born to a Quaker family in Ringwood, Hampshire, Armfield was educated at Sidcot School and at Leighton Park School. In 1887 he was admitted to Birmingham School of Art, then under the headmastership of Edward R. Taylor and established as a major centre of the Arts and Crafts Movement. There he studied under Henry Payne and Arthur Gaskin and, outside the school, received instruction in tempera painting from Joseph Southall at Southall's studio in Edgbaston. He was later to recall: Leaving Birmingham in 1902, he moved to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re under Gustave Courtois and Ren√© Menard, where he became an associate of Gaston Lachaise, Keith Henderson, and Norman Wilkinson. He exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1904, where his painting Faustine was bought by the French State and donated to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, and is now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. In 1909 he married the author and playwright Constance Smedley who was first cousin of his friend and fellow artist William Smedley-Aston and his wife Irene, and, like many with connections to the Arts and Crafts Movement in Birmingham, settled in the Cotswolds. In 1911, they both appear on the census of that year as resident in Minchinhampton (Gloucestershire). The couple became close collaborators: working together to combine design, illustration, text and theatre. Armfield's wife also influenced him to become a pacifist and Christian Scientist. From 1915 the couple spent seven years in the United States. In 1946 Armfield released the book 'Tempera Painting Today', published by Pentagon Press LTD. A detail from Armfield's painting Self-Portrait (1901; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery), was used as the cover illustration of the Oxford World's Classics 2006 edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Armfield has paintings in the collection of several British institutions including Derby Art Gallery, Southampton and Nottingham Gallery and the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery.

It is popularly known as the Sharda Act, after its sponsor Harbilas Sharda. It came into effect six months later on 1 April 1930 and applied to all of British India.Forbes, Geraldin H., Women in Modern India, Cambridge University Press, 1998 It was a result of social reform movement in India. Despite strong opposition from the British authorities, the legislation was passed by the British Indian Government which had a majority of Indians. However, it lacked implementation from the British Indian government, largely due to the fear of British authorities losing support from their loyal Hindu and Muslim communalist groups. Legislation process Various bills addressing questions on the age of consent were introduced in the Indian legislatures and defeated. In 1927, Rai Sahib Harbilas Sharda introduced his Hindu Child Marriage Bill in the Central Legislative Assembly. Under the pressure of world opinion, the social reformists in India and Nationalist freedom fighters, the Government referred the Bill to a select committee named as the Age of Consent Committee headed by Sir Moropant Visavanath Joshi, the Home Member of Central Provinces. The other members of the committee were Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, Khan Bahadur Mathuk, Mian Imam Baksh Kadu, Mrs. O. Brieri Beadon, Rameshwari Nehru, Satyendra Chandra Mitra, Thakur Dass Bhargava, Maulvi Muhammad Yakub, Mian Sir Muhammad Shah Nawaz and M. D. Sagane as Secretary. The All India Women's Conference, Women's Indian Association and National Council of Women in India, through their members developed and articulated the argument in favour of raising of the age for marriage and consent before the Joshi Committee. Muslim women presented their views to the Joshi Committee in favour of raising the age limit of marriage even when they knew that they would face opposition from Muslim Ulemas. The Joshi Committee presented its report on 20 June 1929 and was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council on 28 September 1929 and became a law on 1 April 1930 extending to the whole of British India. It fixed 14 and 18 as the marriageable age for girls and boys respectively of all communities. Significance The Child Marriage Restraint Act was the first social reform issue which was taken up by the organized women in India. They played a major role in the development of argument and actively used the device of political petition and in the process contributed in the field of politics.Forbes, Geraldin H., Women in Modern India, Cambridge University Press, 1998 pp 83 Pro-reform politicians, such as Motilal Nehru, were caught off guard when the organized women's association met with leaders to ask for their support in the bill. The all-India women's association pressured politicians for their support in the bill, standing outside their delegations holding placards and shouting slogans such as 'if you oppose Sharda's bill, the world will laugh at you'. It was also this group who pushed for, and eventually succeeded in having Gandhi address the evils of child marriage in his speeches. Victory for the bill can be credited to the women's association, who presented the act as a means for India to demonstrate its commitment to modernity.Forbes, Geraldin H., Women in Modern India, Cambridge University Press, 1998 pp 71-82;85; 89 Women in India were now challenging the double standards set in place by ancient shastras. Declaring they would begin to make their own laws, free of male influence, the women's organization brought liberal feminism to a forefront. Although this is a victory for the women's movement in India, the act itself was a complete failure. In the two years and five months it was an active bill, there were 473 prosecutions, of which only 167 were successful. The list goes on with 207 acquittals, with 98 cases still pending during August 1932. Out of the 167 successful prosecutions, only 17 or so did either all of or part of their sentence. The majority of cases were in Punjab and the United Provinces. A 1931 census was available to the public during the summer of 1933 in order to give a status report of how the bill was doing: the number of wives under fifteen had increased from 8.5 million to 12 million, but the number of husbands under the age of fifteen had gone from 3 to more than 5 million. The number of wives under the age of five had quadrupled (originally the numbers were about 218,500, which then shot up to 802,200). The percentage of widowed children had decreased from about 400,000 to about 320,000. Though these numbers are startling, during the six months between when it was passed and when it became an active bill, it's suggested that only about three million girls and two million boys were forced into a child marriage; the largest percent of these marriages were between Muslim children. The bill's census report, however, shows that the law reached and affected the masses, even if the numbers are very slight. However, the Act remained a dead letter during the colonial period of British rule in India.Forbes, Geraldin H., Women in Modern India, Cambridge University Press, 1998 pp 89 As per Jawaharlal Nehru, this was largely due to the fact that the colonial British government did nothing to propagate awareness of it, especially in smaller towns and villages of India. In his autobiography, Nehru elucidates that this was largely due to the fact that the British did not want to earn the displeasure of the communal elements among the Hindus and Muslims. In the 1930s, the only parties in India that continued to support the British rule were these communal groups. The British government did not wish to lose their support, hence they completely avoided implementing this and similar social reforms, instead focusing their attention on preventing the Indian freedom movement. Thus their infamous \\"Dual Policy\\" which prevented any significant social reform in India.

Short story cycles are different from novels because the parts that would make up the chapters can all stand alone as short stories, each individually containing a beginning, middle and conclusion. When read as a group there is a tension created between the ideas of the individual stories, often showing changes that have occurred over time or highlighting the conflict between two opposing concepts or thoughts.Mann p.11 Because of this dynamic, the stories need to have an awareness of what the other stories accomplish; therefore, cycles are usually written with the expressed purpose to create a cycle as opposed to being gathered and arranged later.  Definitional debates  Scholars have pointed out that there is a wide range of possibilities that fall between simple collections and novels in their most-commonly understood form. One question is how well the stories stand up individually: chapters of a novel usually cannot stand alone, whereas stories in collections are meant to be fully independent. But many books have combined stories in such a way that the stories have varying degrees of interdependence, and it is these variations that cause problems in definition. Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris, for instance, claim that the stories in a story cycle are more independent than those in a composite novel,Dunn and Morris p.5 and James Nagel points out that both cycle and sequence are misleading, since cycle implies circularity and sequence implies temporal linearity, neither of which he finds to be essential to most such collections. Rolf Lund√©n has suggested four types of cycles, in order of decreasing unity: the cycle, in which the ending resolves the conflicts brought up at the beginning (e.g., The Bridge of San Luis Rey); the sequence, in which each story is linked to the ones before it but without a cumulative story that ties everything together (e.g., The Unvanquished); the cluster, in which the links between stories are not always made obvious and in which the discontinuity between them is more significant than their unity (e.g., Go Down, Moses); and the novella, in the classical sense of a collection of unrelated stories brought together by a frame story and a narrator(s) (e.g., Winesburg, Ohio). [All examples are Lund√©n's.] Robert M. Luscher compares and contrasts the short story cycle and science fiction short stories combined into longer fixups.  History  In their study of the genre, Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris note that the form descends from two different traditions: There are texts that are themselves assembled from other texts, such as the way the tales from the Arthurian cycle are compiled in books by Chretien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Thomas Malory and the Mabinogion. Then there are the classic serialized novellas, many of them with frame stories; this genre includes One Thousand and One Nights, The Decameron, The Canterbury Tales, etc. Dunn and Morris show how in the nineteenth century, the genre appeared in such forms as the village sketch collection (e.g., Our Village) and the patchwork collection (e.g., Louisa May Alcott's Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag). J. Gerald Kennedy describes the proliferation of the genre in the twentieth century, attributing it in part to the desire \\"to renounce the organizing authority of an omniscient narrator, asserting instead a variety of voices or perspectives reflective of the radical subjectivity of modern experience. Kennedy finds this proliferation in keeping with modernism and its use of fragmentation, juxtaposition and simultaneism to reflect the \\"multiplicity\\" that he believed to characterize that century. Scholars such as James Nagel and Roc√≠o G. Davis have pointed out that the story cycle has been very popular among ethnic U.S. authors. Davis argues that ethnic writers find the format useful \\"as a metaphor for the fragmentation and multiplicity of ethnic lives\\" insofar as it highlights \\"the subjectivity of experience and understanding\\" by allowing \\"multiple impressionistic perspectives and fragmentation of simple linear history\\".  The composite novel Dunn and Morris list several methods that authors use to provide unity to the collection as a whole. It has to be noted that these organising principles pertain to their theory of the composite novel as a short story collection where the focus lies on the coherent whole. (the examples are theirs): The organising principles * a geographical area: The Country of the Pointed Firs, Dubliners, The Women of Brewster Place * a central protagonist, which has the option of also being the narrator: Cosmicomics, Winesburg, Ohio, The Woman Warrior, A Certain Lucas * a collective protagonist: In Our Time, Go Down, Moses, Love Medicine, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza * patterns to create coherence: Three Lives, Exile and the Kingdom, The Golden Apples, A Yellow Raft in Blue Water * focus on storytelling itself: The Way to Rainy Mountain, Pricksongs & Descants, How to Make an American Quilt Multiple of these organizing principles may be used in order to create a composite novel.

Rowing  Aikman was educated at Geelong College between 1939-1951 as a 'day boy' (ie not a boarder), where he excelled academically, in sport (athletics, football, and rowing), and the performing arts (winning the Music Prize). He rowed in the First VIII boat at the 1950 Head of the River schoolboys' regatta, which boat (also notable for being coxed by future politician John Button) won the 'Loser's Final'. Aikman was Captain of Boats (ie rowing) in his final year at Geelong College, rowing in the Head of the River a second time. Whilst a student at the University of Melbourne, Aikman rowed for Ormond College, the University's First VIII, and the Victorian King‚Äôs Cup crew (who won in 1956). In 1956, Aikman was the bowman of the Australian boat which won the bronze medal in the eights event. Aikman remained involved in rowing as a coach at the various schools at which he taught, as well as at Hawthorn Rowing Club (in 1960). Aikman was a runner in the 2000 Sydney Olympics torch relay. In 2010, Aikman was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame.  Teaching career  Aikman completed a Bachelor of Science and later a Bachelor of Education at the University of Melbourne. He taught sciences at Camberwell High School from 1956-1959, and chemistry at Scotch College (Melbourne) in 1960-1961, before becoming the Head of Chemistry and a boarding house master at Trinity Grammar, Sydney in 1962. From 1966 until 1973, Aikman was headmaster at The Scots School in Bathurst, New South Wales. In 1974, Aikman was appointed headmaster (later styled 'Principal') of Haileybury College, Melbourne. He remained at Haileybury until his retirement in 1998. During his time at Haileybury, he led a major building programme at the school's Keysborough campus (which had only been established in 1963), including the 'Great Hall', the aquatic centre, and the chapel (designed by Philip Cox, with windows and murals by Leonard French). Aikman was passionate about music and the performing arts, \\"mov[ing] to make music and drama central to activities at [Haileybury]\\" by establishing the student orchestra and concert band, expanding the drama department and promoting the school play, and instituting the biennial Tattoo (variety show), in which Aikman (who had \\"a fine baritone voice) himself would often perform as part of the \\"(in)famous\\" 'Chalkdusters' (a singing ensemble of Haileybury staff). Aikman was fond of the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan.  Death and legacy  Aikman died in 2005. His funeral was held in the chapel at Haileybury, whose construction he had overseen. Acknowledging Aikman's commitment to, and promotion of, music and the performing arts, the 'Great Hall' at Haileybury was renamed the 'Aikman Hall'; similarly, there is also an 'Aikman Hall' at The Scots School, Bathurst.

He was the father of Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi, a poet. He led a social reform movements in Ahmedabad, and wrote articles against superstitions, caste restrictions and child marriage. He dealt with the problem of widow remarriage at length in his poem, Vencharitra. Biography Dalpatram was born on 21 January 1820 at Wadhwan city of Surendranagar district in a Brahmin family. Dalpatram grew up to the resonant chanting of 'mantras' and recitations of religious scriptures. He was a child prodigy and displayed his extraordinary literary skills by composing hondulas at the age of 12. He mastered the structures of rhyme, poesis and 'Vrajbhasha' as a Swaminarayan devotee under Brahmanand Swami, and later moved to Ahmedabad at the age of 24. Dalpatram died on 25 March 1898 at Ahmedabad. Career Dalpatram was a Sanskrit scholar and poet. Dalpatram taught Gujarati language to Alexander Kinloch Forbes, a British colonial administrator to Ahmedabad. Gujarati was considered at the bottom of language hierarchy during those times, so he preferred to write his poems in Brajbhasha instead of Gujarati, his mothertongue. Forbes encouraged him to write in Gujarati. Forbes and Dalpatram became close friends, and he inspired Dalpatram to write Laxmi Natak published in 1849, the first modern play in Gujarati, based on Greek drama Plutus. Forbes, who wanted Gujarati literature to develop, had helped start the Gujarat Vernacular Society. He served as its first assistant secretary and started the Buddhiprakash periodical in 1850, editing it until 1878. When Forbes died in 1865, Dalpatram composed Farbesvirah, a Gujarati elegy, and Farbesvilas, his account of the gathering of bards, both dedicated to him. At the end of the 19th century, he was entitled Mahakavi (Great Poet) by Sahajanand Swami, the founder of Swaminarayan Sampraday. Unlike Narmad, another prominent Gujarati poet of the same period, Dalpatram supported British rule for the benefits it gave India. Dalpatram also supported social reforms such as opposition to child marriage and allowing widows to remarry. Both Dalpatram and Narmad were the first Gujarati poets to address subjects connected to common life in their verses. Dalpatram's poems had subjects like English law, how to write an essay, and even \\"trees in a college compound\\". His verse often reflected his sense of humour. Dalpatram was an authority on meters and wrote a treatise, Pingal (\\"Prosody\\"), which was used by scholars as a source book for many decades. Statue and Memorial left In tribute to Dalpatram's work, AMC and citizens of Ahmedabad proposed a memorial at the site of his house, which was destroyed in 1985. With very few references or photographs available, it was very difficult to recreate the house. References were taken from the memories of residents and the architectural design of surrounding houses to create a memorial in the form of facade of the house and statue of Kavi Dalpatram in 2001. In 2001, the memorial became a part of Heritage walk of Ahmedabad. The design of statue was debated before they came up with the idea of Kavi in sitting posture with a book in his lap. The statue is made of bronze and weighs 120 kg. The platform behind the statue displays the plan of the original house. The yellow stone on the floor indicates the walls, grey stone indicates the rooms and the black stone represents the open courtyard. The staircase is also marked with yellow stone. The memorial also serves as a platform for community gatherings. His plays and recitations are also enthusiastically performed on various occasions including his birthday. The Heritage department has taken the responsibility of maintenance of the Dalpatram Memorial. Contest with Narmad Just at the time when Narmad was emerging into celebrity (1859), Dalpatram who had already won his laurels, happened to visit Bombay for treatment of his eyes. Lovers of Gujarati poetry, they met together, and in the poetical contest that took place, naturally they warmed up and their audience took sides as to who was the better poet. The result was a lifelong estrangement between the two. The contest was continued in the public papers and a humorous paper. The Parsi Punch, a weekly, published a cartoon, in which they were represented as fighting each other with the top-knot of the hair of their heads in their hands. Legacy He was a progressive thinker and advocated the upliftment of oppressed classes and women's empowerment. He used his literary skills to bring about changes in society. The Kavishwar Dalpatram Award is named after him. Works His career spanned 6 books and 25 awards including drama, poems, songs, essays and articles. Hari Lila Amrut, Ven Charitra, Mithyabhiman and Laxmi are his major contributions. * Laxmi (play) * Shrey (play) * Bapani Pinpar (poetry) * Mithyabhiman (play) * Farbesvirah (elegy) * Farbesvilas (poetry) See also * Gujarati literature * List of Gujarati-language writers ReferencesExternal links * Category:1820 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Gujarati-language writers Category:Indian male poets Category:Gujarati-language poets Category:Gujarati theatre Category:19th- century Indian poets Category:19th-century Indian dramatists and playwrights Category:Indian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Poets from Gujarat Category:19th-century male writers Category:Dramatists and playwrights from Gujarat ","title":"Dalpatram"},{"id":"20734875","text":"Lieutenant General Sir Charles Edmond Knox, KCB (28 February 1846 ‚Äì 1 November 1938) was an Anglo-Irish soldier of the British Army.

The character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 12 May 2008. On 29 April 2010, it was announced that Leskovac had been axed from the show after two years and would depart in \\"an exciting and dramatic storyline which will be an integral part of the build-up to Coronation Street 50th anniversary\\". Natasha departed on 27 September 2010. On 16 July 2020, it was announced that Leskovac would be reprising her role as Natasha, with her return airing 11 September 2020. Storylines2008‚Äì2010= In December 2008, Natasha informs Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) that her brother and sister-in-law have just had a baby daughter and are naming her Electra. She spots a good business opportunity in opening the salon for late night trading hours during the week, an idea Audrey agrees to. Natasha is drafted in to style Molly Compton's (Vicky Binns) hair for her wedding day in January 2009. In February, she flirts with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) in the Rovers and they go on a date but Steve is jealous that Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) is dating Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) and behaves quite badly during his and Natasha's date. She is not impressed by Steve as his idea of a date is a takeaway in the Rovers so when Steve asks her out again, she declines but tells him that there are no hard feelings. On 23 March 2009, Natasha starts a relationship with Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) and initially, Natasha does most of the talking while Tony sits silently. Just as she is about to leave, he asks her to stop and take her coat off and the pair subsequently have sex. Natasha is in good spirits, following her night with Tony, and tells Maria Connor (Samia Smith) about it, making Maria jealous as she is developing romantic feelings for Tony herself. Maria tries to warn Natasha off him, claiming that he will treat her badly and even tries setting her up with Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley) but Natasha is happy with Tony. Some months later, Natasha becomes suspicious of the amount of time that Tony and Maria are spending together. Jealously, Natasha tells Maria that Tony is only paying her attention because he feels sorry for her. Tony is furious when he discovers what Natasha has said, leading to a showdown between them and they split up. Natasha tries to warn Maria about Tony's 'dark side' but she won't listen. In April 2010, Natasha finds herself attracting the attention of Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey). She is amused at his attempts to woo her until she discovers that he is doing the same with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan). They agree to teach him a lesson; Natasha feigns interest in Graeme and meets him for a drink at The Rovers where she playfully flirts with him. When she asks him about Rosie, he states that she is a bimbo and that he has no interest in her. At that moment, Rosie comes up behind him and pours a pint over his head, much to the amusement of the pub. Later that month, Natasha sets her sights on Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and he agrees to go out with her, after she makes her interest in him clear. However, after he cancels several dates, she angrily confronts him and he is impressed by her feisty personality, making him take their relationship more seriously but Natasha soon feels excluded by Nick and his family, firstly as Nick's mother Gail McIntyre's (Helen Worth) is very cold towards her and Nick constantly puts his business before their relationship. Eager to settle down, Natasha suggests they get a place together but Nick is preoccupied with business woes, due to Underworld recently burning down, and virtually ignores her. Worried about his dealings with ex-wife, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), she lends him ¬£3,000 for new business premises to secure the future of the factory in an attempt to please him. In July 2010, while organising a surprise 70th birthday party for Audrey, Natasha discovers that her boss is considering retiring and ambitious, Natasha offers to buy the salon and is not happy to learn that Maria also wants to buy the business. Natasha's insecurity is not helped by Nick's devious half-brother, David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), telling her that Nick and Maria were once engaged and that she is just one of many women that Nick has been involved with. Despairing at Nick's lack of commitment, her problems worsen when she learns that she is pregnant in August. She is about to tell Nick this but he ends their relationship first as he feels she is too needy. Later, Natasha sees Nick and Leanne together at the factory and angrily tells him about the baby but Nick is angry that she didn't tell him sooner and storms off. Fearing she'd be a single parent, Natasha has an abortion but Nick visits Natasha, telling her that he wants them to be a family. Unsure how to tell him about the termination, she lets him believe that she is still expecting and events spiral out of control when Nick announces her pregnancy in the Rovers. After Natasha steals Fiz Stape's (Jennie McAlpine) scan picture and passes it off as her own, she breaks down and admits the truth to Fiz when she realises what has happened. Seeing how these events are affecting her, Fiz urges her to tell Nick the truth but just as she is about to, Nick asks her to marry him and she agrees, much to Fiz's indignation. However, Gail is suspicious as Natasha's behaviour is not what you'd expect from a pregnant woman and checks her medical records. When she sees Natasha's abortion, she demands either Natasha tell him the truth or she will. Gail doesn't give Natasha much chance to tell Nick before she tells him, causing them to argue. Nick then tells Natasha that she will always be second best to Leanne and demands she move out, resulting in her attempting suicide by taking an overdose of prescription drugs. Feeling guilty about his actions, Nick returns to the flat and finding her unconscious, calls an ambulance and rushes her to the hospital, where she recovers. Nick tells her he is sorry and that they will try again once she is better. Natasha is discharged from hospital the next morning, and stays with Audrey while she recovers. Nick visits and asks if she wants to try for another baby, much to her surprise and delight. After Nick leaves, Audrey and Natasha have a heart-to-heart and Natasha realises that Nick doesn't love her and is simply trying to make amends for his past behaviour. Knowing that a relationship under those circumstances is doomed, she leaves Audrey's and returns to Coronation Street, wanting revenge on all those who misunderstood or were horrible to her. During her visit, Natasha berates Leanne for being a catalyst in her break-up with Nick and tells David that Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) will never love him as he has no heart or feelings. She also goes to Underworld and causes chaos by telling the workers about Nick's special \\"nicknames\\" for them, and saving best for last, she gets Gail sacked from the Medical Centre in front of Betty Williams (Betty Driver) by revealing to Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor) how Gail broke the rules of patient confidentiality by hacking into private medical records, her last words to Gail are: \\"Hope you have a nice life Gail, ooh look, I had my fingers crossed\\", before leaving. An empowered but tearful Natasha then leaves Weatherfield in the back of a taxi as Nick watches on. =2020‚Äì= In September 2020, Natasha bumps into Nick whilst they are both visiting the hospital. She tells him that she is ‚Äúin a much better place now‚Äù and apologised for the past. Later in the day, it is revealed that Natasha now has a son and tells the doctor that she has been reminded of his Dad today, meaning that Nick is his father. The next day, she visits Nick at his flat and reveals that they have a son together called Sam, who was conceived after her abortion. She tries to urge him to see Sam but Nick is going through a tough time as his step-son with Leanne has a life-threatening condition. Casting Rachel Leskovac was to take on the role, with a Coronation Street spokesman confirming it: \\"Rachel's very well known in TV land as she has been in countless series and dramas. To have her new character in the salon is a smashing coup.\\" The actress stated in an interview that she only felt really part of the backstage family when her character became more involved with central storylines saying: \\"Last year, it was a bit sporadic because I wasn't in for weeks on end, so every time I came back it felt like my first day again. It's only now in the new year that it's started to feel like I'm part of the family!\\". Character development In an interview, Leskovac said: \\"I'd say Natasha's a romantic. She likes to have fun and isn't malicious in the slightest. She loves her job, too. I think she's looking for love but not necessarily settling down at the minute, though.\\". Her take on the character she plays after one year in the show. The character tends to talk a lot and generally say anything that comes into her head. ITV publicity describe the characters typical ditzy blonde image, describe her as loving Scottish accents and the sound of her own voice and hating shellfish and dandruff. =Return= In July 2020, it was confirmed that Natasha had been reintroduced by producer Iain McLeod. Natasha is set to return in September 2020 after being away for over ten years. Speaking about her return, Leskovac said: \\"I am very excited and proud to be welcomed back to Coronation Street, especially as so many old friends are still there. It's always great to be able to return to a character to explore a whole new path for them. Reception Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture, who runs a monthly column on the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, including Natasha, attributing her rise in popularity, stating: \\"A fairly new addition to Weatherfield, Natasha is proving so far very likeable. This could all change, but for now, we‚Äôre loving her work.\\" Deborah Ross of The Independent described her as having \\"trapped a man by pretending to be pregnant\\" before adding that \\"Obviously, she cannot think nine months ahead\\". Due to her portrayal of Natasha on Coronation Street, fellow soap opera Hollyoaks executive producer Bryan Kirkwood decided to cast Leskovac as Joanne Cardsley in the soap in September 2015, as he admired her performances as Natasha.

History The view of the crater valley of the caldera of Santo Cristo, on the northern coast of the complex The main roadway in the Topo complex between Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio and Santo Ant√£o The base of the Topo complex originated in numerous shield volcanoes, erupting from primordial fissural faults that ran along a northwest to southeast and east-southeast to west-northwest alignment. These structures are only observed in the curvature of the higher turf cones, as far as above sea level. These activities initiated around 600,000 years ago.G. F√©raud et al. (1980), p.276 The island of S√£o Jorge had its initial formation from the rising of magma along these fractures through the earth's crust, resulting in effusive volcanism from the area east of Ribeira Seca until Topo (from which it got its name). Owing to age, continuous effusive eruptions occurred simultaneously with the eruption on the island of Faial, along the Volcanic Complex of Ribeirinha. Volcanism in this zone continued, with some interruptions over the next 500,000 years approximately. But, continuous erosion, from coastal action, humidity and rainfall, wind and thermal amplitudes, resulted in an interior relief forming a more gently appearing landscape, in comparison to the western areas of Ribeira Seca. Geography The volcanic complex occupies the eastern part of the island and consists of basalt lavas, hawaiite and mugearite (aa) lavas, from explosive pyroclastic rocks and cinder cones originating from Strombolian eruptions. Its features around the complex includes the Pico do Brejo do Cordeiro and several others.

Life Alexander Ledkovsky was born in Teupitz, Germany during war-time to parents Marina Viktorovna Ledkovsky (n√©e Fasolt) and Boris Mikhailovich Ledkovsky, a prominent choral director and composer/arranger of Russian Orthodox Church music. Having emigrated to the United States in 1951, Alexander was educated at Trinity School and Columbia University, where he earned a B.A. in Music. Although he developed a successful career as a computer expert and software developer, his life's love was his work as a musician of the Russian Orthodox Church. Having studied choir direction both at university and under his father's tutelage, he took on responsibilities as assistant choirmaster at the Russian Orthodox Synod Cathedral \\"Our Lady of the Sign\\" located on Park Avenue at 93rd Street in New York. He also ran a secondary choir for the cathedral's English-speaking parish in the late 1960s. When his father's health declined, Alexander assumed full responsibility for the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR)'s flagship choir, on Forgiveness Sunday in 1975. He held this post until his own declining health forced him to relegate responsibilities to assistants in 2002. Musical work During his tenure, which lasted more than a quarter-century, Alexander Ledkovsky led a number of unique projects, including concerts at Lincoln Center, performances at Carnegie Hall (in cooperation with the Russian Choral Society and the Opera Orchestra of NY), and a number of grand occasions at the cathedral, such as the canonization of the New Martyrs of Russia in 1981, the funeral of Metropolitan Philaret and the memorial services and funerals of many renowned members of the Russian emigrate community, such as choreographer George Balanchine. Under Alexander Ledkovsky's direction, the choir produced two compact disc recordings in 1994: \\"All-Night Vigil for 700 Years of the Our Lady of Kursk Icon\\" and \\"Celebrating the Composer's Centennial: Divine Liturgy of Boris M. Ledkovsky\\" In 1999, Ledkovsky launched one of the first websites devoted to online publication of music scores of Russian Orthodox Church Music, www.rocm.org. Although he fell ill with cancer that same year, and succumbed to the disease within five years, Ledkovsky was astonishingly productive in his work to create and publish numerous liturgical scores, including music for the full services of each of the services of the complete cycle of Orthodox Feasts. After a struggle with head and neck cancer, Ledkovsky died in his home on Christmas Eve, 2004. His funeral was served by three bishops (ROCOR Metropolitan Laurus, Bishop Gabriel of Manhattan and Bishop Peter of Cleveland) more than a dozen priests, several deacons, and a chorus of more than 100 singers,Schedule of Funeral Services for Alexander B Ledkovsky some of them travelling far distances to pay him homage.

It was armed with a M1919 Browning machine gun and could reach a maximum speed of 8 mph. The 3-Ton had a 17-gallon tank that gave it a maximum range of 34 miles. History Design on the 3-ton tank started in mid-1917, before which American tank forces had been largely equipped with British or French examples. The 3-Ton was a two-man tank designed so that American forces could use another tank besides the Renault FT in battle, and was designed around the FT but as a cheaper alternative. Its two Ford Model T engines were controlled by the driver, seated at the front with a gunner beside him who had control of a .30-06 machine gun (either a M1917 Marlin machine gun or M1919 Browning machine gun) on a limited-traverse mount with approximately 550 rounds of ammunition. The initial production run of the 3-ton was of fifteen vehicles; one of these was sent to France for testing. A contract for 15,000 of these vehicles was awarded; however, the U.S tank corps felt it did not meet the requirements they wanted. The contract for the 15,000 tanks was ended by the Armistice, leaving only the fifteen original vehicles produced. The French Army evaluated the Ford 3-Ton tank and thought it inferior to the native Renault FT. However, the 3-Ton Tank was seen to have potential as a cheap, light, all-terrain artillery tractor especially for batteries of the Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897. One thousand five hundred 3-Ton tanks were ordered from Ford but the Armistice intervened before any were delivered and the order was cancelled.

The Muslim congregation in Iceland said they had never heard of this money. Si√∞mennt, the Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association, issued a statement about it in general terms and did not criticise this particular decision because of the principle of equal treatment. According to Si√∞mennt, it was not part of municipality's functions to grant building plots to religious or life-stance organizations, such as the Evangelic-Lutheran State Church, the Catholic Church, or the Association of Muslims in Iceland, free of charge. However, since that system is in place it must be applied equally to all. Si√∞mennt would not apply for a building plot for itself though in order to stick to its main principle of separation of state and church.http://sidmennt.is/2013/07/11/yfirlysing-fra-sidmennt-vegna- fyrirhugadrar-byggingar-mosku-i-reykjavik/ In 2010 Salmann Tamimi said that the Association of Muslims in Iceland would never raise money from abroad to build the new mosque.http://www.visir.is/salmann-tamimi--moska-verdur-ad-vera- a-islenskum-forsendum/article/2010163892745 His successor, however, has said that funds for the mosque will be raised abroad, including Muslims in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, president of Iceland, √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson expressed concern that Saudi Arabian financing of a Reykjav√≠k mosque will fuel Islamic extremism in Iceland, and he was, \\"shocked to the point of paralysis when he learned last March, in a meeting with Saudi Arabian Ambassador, that the government of Saudi Arabia had decided to interfere in Icelandic religious life by donating one million US Dollars to the planned mosque\\".

Early life and education Kimball was born in Provo, Utah, grew up on a dairy farm in Draper, Utah and worked in the fields where his family grew alfalfa, sugar beets, and grain. He continued to work on the family farm throughout his schooling, including his time in law school. His family sold their farm to the Catholic Diocese in 1996 and it is now the site of the Skaggs Catholic Center, which houses Juan Diego High School. Kimball first became interested in law while taking a commercial law class from E.L. Crawford at Jordan High School. Kimball graduated magna cum laude from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science. In 1967, he received his Juris Doctor from the University of Utah College of Law, graduating Order of the Coif and second in his class. While attending law school, Kimball was a member of the Phi Kappa Phi fraternity and was the Case Note Editor of the Utah Law Review. Legal career After graduating from law school, Kimball began his legal practice at Van Cott, Bagley, Cornwall & McCarthy in Salt Lake City, Utah, where Kimball maintained a full-time general practice until 1974. In 1974, Kimball became a full-time law professor at BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School. In his second year as a full-time professor, Kimball also co-founded the law firm formerly known as Kimball, Parr, Waddoups, Brown & Gee. The firm is now known as Parr, Brown, Gee & Loveless. Kimball continued to teach part-time at BYU from 1976 to 1980. From 1975 until his appointment as a United States District Judge in 1997, Kimball maintained a full-time legal practice, primarily in commercial litigation. Federal judicial career On September 4, 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated Kimball as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Kimball's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 21, 1997 and he received his commission on October 24, 1997. On November 24, 1997, Kimball was sworn in as a United States District Judge. Kimball replaced the Judge David K. Winder, who took senior status in June 1997. After twelve years as a full-time district court judge, Kimball took senior status on November 30, 2009. However, Kimball maintained a full case load until November 30, 2010. Kimball maintains a 60 percent case load and has resumed teaching part-time at BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School. Notable cases During his time on the bench, Kimball has presided over many notable cases, such as the Brian David Mitchell criminal trial, case no. 2:08cr125DAK,[Case Number 2:08cr125DAK] and the second Main Street Plaza case, case no. 2:03cv688DAK.[Case Number 2:03cv688DAK] In the case of Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Norton, Case No. 2:99cv852DAK,[Case Number 2:99cv852DAK] Judge Kimball's decision was reversed by the Tenth Circuit, but the United States Supreme Court then reversed the Tenth Circuit and affirmed Judge Kimball (9-0), Norton v SUWA, 542 U.S. 55 (2004). More than 800 of his memorandum decisions appear on Westlaw. In 1999, Kimball sat by designation with the Tenth Circuit of Appeals, authoring two published opinions and two unpublished opinions: Zeran v.

Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Eileen Barzee, Case No. 2:08CR125DAK= After Defendant Brian David Mitchell was declared incompetent to stand trial in Utah state court for the alleged kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, he and co-defendant Wanda Barzee were indicted by a federal grand jury for kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor. Because Mitchell‚Äôs competency to stand trial was at issue, the court sent Mitchell to a federal medical facility for a mental evaluation. On October 1, 2009, and December 1 through 11, 2009, the court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Mitchell was competent to stand trial. The court heard testimony from several psychologists and psychiatrist as well as Elizabeth Smart and many other witnesses who had interactions with Mitchell throughout his life. On March 1, 2010, the court issued a memorandum decision and order finding Mitchell competent to stand trial. The court then scheduled trial for November 1, 2010. Because of extensive pretrial publicity of the case, Mitchell filed a motion to transfer venue to another district. The court denied the motion after reviewing juror questionnaires filled out by hundreds of potential jurors. After a five-week trial that proceeded on November 1, 2010, and continued until December 10, 2010, a jury found Mitchell guilty of both offenses. The trial focused mainly on Mitchell‚Äôs insanity defense and required the jury to determine whether Mitchell was legally insane at the time of the offense. Elizabeth Smart again testified as did many of the same witnesses from the prior competency hearing. The trial also raised several First Amendment media access issues that required rulings from the court throughout the proceedings. On May 25, 2011, Judge Kimball sentenced Mitchell to life in prison under the federal sentencing guidelines and the sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3553a. Mitchell decided not to appeal. After being declared competent to stand trial as a result of forced medication ordered by the state court, Wanda Barzee entered into a plea agreement with the federal government. Judge Kimball sentenced Barzee on November 17, 2009, to 15 years in prison. Portions of interviews with Barzee were entered into evidence during Mitchell‚Äôs competency hearing and Barzee testified in person at Mitchell‚Äôs trial. =Utah Gospel Mission v. Salt Lake City Corp., Case No. 2:03cv688DAK= The Main Street II lawsuit was the second round of a long-standing and divisive dispute pertaining to Salt Lake City‚Äôs sale of a block of Main Street to the LDS Church. The first round of the dispute, which was handled by another judge in this district, involved the City‚Äôs sale of Main Street Plaza and the City‚Äôs reservation of a pedestrian easement through the Plaza, while allowing the LDS Church to control behavior and limit First Amendment activity on the Plaza. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately determined that the easement itself was a public forum for First Amendment purposes and that the City and Church could not prohibit protected speech on the easement. See First Unitarian Church v. Salt Lake City Corp., 308 F.3d 114 (10 Cir. 2002) (‚ÄúMain Street I‚Äù). The Main Street II litigation challenged the constitutionality of the City‚Äôs subsequent sale of the pedestrian easement to the LDS Church. Through the sale, the LDS Church secured the right to prohibit First Amendment activity on the Main Street Plaza, and, in exchange, the City obtained 2.125 acres of LDS Church-owned property in the Glendale neighborhood of the City, payment of half the attorneys‚Äô fees awarded against the City in the previous litigation, and $5 million in cash and land from the Alliance for Unity. In total, the City obtained over $5.375 million in land and cash in exchange for the easement, which had been valued at $500,000. In the lawsuit, Plaintiffs argued that the Mayor‚Äôs decision to sell the easement was brought about by the undue influence of the LDS Church. The City and the LDS Church, on the other hand, argued that the Mayor proposed a compromise that, among other things, would bring many secular benefits to the City, including obtaining land and cash valued at over $5.375 million, putting to rest the legal battles between the City and the LDS Church, and helping to heal the wounds of a City divided along religious lines. The specific issues in this case were whether the sale of the easement (1) violated Plaintiffs‚Äô rights to freedom of expression and assembly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and (2) constituted an improper establishment of religion under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 4 of the Utah Constitution. The court dismissed both claims, finding that the property at issue had become an entirely private, Church-owned Plaza devoid of any government property interests that could create a public forum. The court determined that the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not apply to the Plaza or to the now- extinguished easement. The court also found that Plaintiffs had not stated a claim under the Establishment Clause, finding that the sale of the easement to the LDS Church, even assuming that it was partially motivated by the religious purposes of those involved, served a reasonable secular purpose. Given the facts of the case, the court held that Plaintiffs had failed to allege that the City‚Äôs actions had the principle or primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion because a reasonable observer would not view the decision to sell the easement as communicating a message of government endorsement of the LDS Church. In addition, the court determined that Plaintiffs had failed to adequately allege that the sale of the easement created excessive entanglement between the City and the LDS Church. If anything, the court found, the sale actually eliminated the likelihood of excessive entanglement. Finally, the court held that when the City merely elected one of two choices presented by the Tenth Circuit of Appeals in Main Street I, it could hardly be said that the reason for the City‚Äôs decision was to promote or endorse the LDS Church. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed Judge Kimball‚Äôs decision. See Utah Gospel Mission v. Salt Lake City Corp., 425 F3d 1249 (10 Cir. 2005).

A Democrat, he was first elected to the New York State Assembly in District 86 in 2008. Castro resigned from office in 2013 after pleading guilty to perjury charges. He is notable for having worn a wire as an FBI informant while serving in elected office; in so doing, he assisted the federal government in prosecuting other corrupt elected officials. Political career In 2008, Castro--a Democrat--was first elected to the New York State Assembly in District 86; the district includes the University Heights, Tremont, and Fordham sections of the Bronx. He succeeded Luis Diaz and became the first Dominican to represent the Bronx in the State Assembly. In July 2009, the Bronx County District Attorney charged Castro with perjury. The charges were kept secret, and Castro agreed to cooperate with the Bronx County District Attorney and later with the FBI. Castro proceeded to win re-election in 2010 and 2012, but was living a \\"double life\\" as an FBI informant during that time. Information obtained by Castro was used to prosecute six other corrupt elected officials. While Castro's original deal did not involve jail time, he was charged in 2013 with lying to investigators. In 2013, Castro's role as an FBI informant became public knowledge during the scandal affecting his Assembly colleague, Eric Stevenson. Castro resigned his Assembly seat on April 8, 2013. He later pleaded guilty to the 2009 state charges and the 2013 federal charge against him.

As opposed to other important fisheries biologists, such as Daniel Pauly and Carl J. Walters, Cushing was a proponent of keeping fisheries open to the point of collapse.Cushing, DH (1966) The arctic cod: a study of research into the British trawl fisheries. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK. Early life Cushing was born in Alnwick, England. His father was an English teacher and his mother was a nurse. By way of his own desire to be a naturalist, his father's desire for him to become a diplomat, and his mother's desire for him to become a doctor, Cushing found a great interest in fisheries biology and management. Cushing also served in the British military in the Royal Artillery (1940‚Äì1945) and the Royal Fusiliers (1945‚Äì1946). Cushing is survived by his wife, Diana Antona-Traversi, whom he married in 1943, and his daughter.David Cushing: Sea fisheries ecologist who brought scientific rigour to understanding the inscrutable life cycle of the North Sea herring The Times, 27 March 2008David Cushing: Marine fisheries ecologist The Independent, 11 April 2008 Career Cushing received his lower education from Duke's School (Alnwick) and the Royal Grammar School (Newcastle upon Tyne) and received his PhD in 1950 from Balliol College at Oxford University. His PhD dissertation focused on the vertical migration of zooplankton. After receiving his PhD, Cushing worked primarily for government organisations that oversaw the fisheries in Great Britain. For most of his career (1946‚Äì1980), he worked for the Centre for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS). At CEFAS, he held the positions of scientific officer, deputy director, and as the head of fish population dynamics. His last position allowed him to focus primarily on factors influencing the stock dynamics of local fisheries and the management strategies those fisheries open. Cushing, although not directly employed by, worked closely with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). At ICES, Cushing held positions on advisory committees for fisheries management and marine pollution. He also chaired the biological committee and was the head of the herring workgroup. The most prestigious position that Cushing held was that of the founding editor of the Journal of Plankton Research, which he held from 1979‚Äì2001. Contributions to fish population ecologyAcoustic fish detection= Acoustics were greatly improved upon during World War II so as to be used as a tool to detect unfriendly vessels and underwater hazards. After the war, acoustic detection was seen as a tool that could assist fisheries biologists to sample stock sizes. Cushing investigated the mechanisms that permitted the acoustic returns from the signalling devices to the fish and back. Through experimental procedures, using materials such as meat-filled condoms and air-filled balloons, Cushing determined that greater than 50% of the acoustic return was from the swimbladder of the fish. Cushing and colleagues also determined that it was possible to resolve, on the species level, the identity of a mass of fish through precise acoustic signals.Cushing, DH (1973) The detection of fish. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK. =Match/mismatch hypothesis= The match/mismatch hypothesis was coined by Cushing as a result of noticeable variations in fish stock recruitment. The hypothesis focused on the timing, as a function of climate, of the blooms of primary producers (i.e. phytoplankton). Blooms of phytoplankton directly influence the increased population sizes of zooplankton, as the phytoplankton are the primary food source for zooplankton. Most pelagic fish, in their larval stages, feed directly upon the phytoplankton and zooplankton. So as logic follows, large populations of phytoplankton will support large populations of zooplankton, and the presence of both will sustain larval fishes. As Cushing noticed, however, there are climatic influences where temperature anomalies will inhibit phytoplankton blooms, or impact the range of the bloom. When such events occur, they will have cascading effects that will influence the ability for larval fish to develop, thus reducing the number of fish that recruit into an existing population.Cushing, DH (1990) Plankton production and year-class strength in fish populations: an update of the match/mismatch hypothesis in Advances in Marine Biology (eds) JHS Blaxter and AJ Southward. Academic Press Limited, San Diego, CA. pgs: 250‚Äì313. With the previously mentioned events, the \\"match\\" portion of the hypothesis occurs when plankton blooms occur just prior the hatching of the fish larvae. In a \\"match\\" situation, the fish larvae are able to feed on large quantities of plankton, thus increasing their potential for successful recruitment. The \\"mismatch\\" portion of the hypothesis occurs when plankton blooms occur either earlier than usual, later than usual, or simply in far lesser quantities than expected. As a result, there are less prey for the fish larvae to feed upon, and the success of a recruitment event is severely diminished.Cushing, DH (1981) Fisheries biology: a study in population dynamics. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wisconsin. The match/mismatch hypothesis is featured in many of Cushing's writings, however the most influential purpose of the hypothesis is that of awareness of climate change and fisheries management. The intent of the hypothesis was to explain climate induced temperature anomalies (as a result of climate change) on fish stocks and the proper management strategies that could be associated with such changes. With some level of predictability, then, fish stocks would then avoid over-exploitation and be harvested at sustainable levels.Cushing, DH (1992) Climate and Fisheries.

Very little of medieval Glasgow remains, the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th-century Provand's Lordship and 12th-century St. Mungo's Cathedral. St. Mungo's Cathedral, also known as the High Kirk and Glasgow Cathedral, is the oldest building in Glasgow and is an example of Scottish Gothic architecture. The vast majority of the city as seen today dates from the 19th century.

Early life and education  Born in Logan, Utah, Stewart received a Bachelor of Science degree from Utah State University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah.  Professional career  From 1974 until 1980, Stewart worked in private legal practice in Salt Lake City. He then served as an assistant to United States Senator Orrin Hatch in 1980, and then worked as an administrative assistant to United States Representative James V. Hansen from 1981 until 1985. From 1985 until 1992, Stewart was a commissioner on the Public Service Commission of Utah. From 1993 until 1998, Stewart served as the executive director of Utah's Department of Natural Resources. From 1998 until becoming a federal judge in 1999, Stewart served as a chief of staff to then-Utah Governor Mike Leavitt.  Nomination to federal district court, filibuster and confirmation  In mid-1999, President Bill Clinton nominated Stewart to federal district court to fill a seat vacated by Judge John Thomas Greene, who had taken senior status in November 1997. Clinton, a Democrat, nominated Stewart, a Republican, because Stewart was a friend of Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Hatch at that time was the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Clinton did so as a courtesy to Hatch, hoping the gesture would encourage Republican senators to act to confirm many of the president's languishing judicial nominees. However, Hatch demanded that Stewart be confirmed before senators could consider other judicial nominees. That enraged Senate Democrats, who refused to allow for a vote on Stewart. That prompted Republican senators to take the very rare move of filing for cloture on the nomination of a federal district judge. On September 21, 1999, Democrats unified to successfully filibuster Stewart's nomination, in a 55-44 party-line vote on the Senate floor that may well have been the only successful filibuster ever on a federal district court nominee. Two weeks later, Democratic and Republican senators announced a deal that paved the way for votes on the nominations of Stewart and two other judicial nominees. On October 5, 1999, the Senate vote 93-5 to confirm Stewart. Stewart received his judicial commission on November 11, 1999. He served as Chief Judge from 2011 to 2014. He assumed senior status on September 1, 2014. Notable case Stewart made the initial ruling in favor of the terms-of sale restrictions on the easement in the LDS plaza by the Salt Lake Temple.Deseret News, May 3, 2004  Personal  Stewart is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With his brother, Chris Stewart, he wrote the book _Seven Miracles That Saved America: Why They Matter and Why We Should Have Hope_ , which was published in 2009, and the book _The Miracle of Freedom: 7 Tipping Points that Saved the World_ , which was published in 2011.

Family Eugene Wason came from a Liberal family. His father, brother and son-in-law, were all Liberal Members of Parliament. His father was Rigby Wason sometime MP for Ipswich,The Times, 6 December 1910 his brother was Cathcart Wason the MP for Orkney and Shetland from 1900‚Äì1921 (and previously an MP in New Zealand 1876‚Äì79), first elected as a Liberal Unionist but later switching to the LiberalsThe Times, 3 March 1954 and his daughter Minna married John William Crombie who was MP for Kincardineshire from 1892‚Äì1908. In 1870, Wason married Eleanor Mary from Dolgelly, the daughter of C. R. Williams, Deputy Lieutenant of Merionethshire. They had three sons and two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Stature and character Wason, like his brother Cathcart, was well over 6 feet tall.The Times, 20 April 1927 He was described by one of the contemporary Speakers of the House of Commons as ‚Äòthe largest and tallest man in the House.‚ÄôJames William Lowther Ullswater, A Speaker's Commentaries; Edward Arnold, 1925 p97 Sir Percy Harris who was Liberal MP for Bethnal Green South West and whose father was a close friend of Wason's has recorded that Eugene and Cathcart were giants, Eugene being thick set and heavy while Cathcart was willowy and thin. Harris related that the story always told about Eugene was that if he stepped on a weighing machine the hands would go on until they could no farther as he topped the maximum 20 stone mark on the dial. Not surprisingly, according to Harris, Eugene was fond of his food and wine,Percy Harris, Forty Years In and Out of Parliament; Andrew Melrose, 1949) although he was also a keen sportsman listing his recreations in Who's Who in his younger days as football, shooting, rowing, and fishing although in later life these pursuits turned into reading, bridge, backgammon, and the card game picquet. Education Wason was educated first privately in France at Boulogne-sur-Mer, then at Rock Ferry in Cheshire before going to Rugby School.The Times, 21 December 1899 While at Rugby, Wason served in the School Rifle Corps, achieving the rank of Lieutenant. He later became a member of the 8th Ayrshire Rifle Volunteers. After Rugby, Wason went to Wadham College, Oxford where he gained a BA degree in 1868 and an MA in 1870. While he was a student at Oxford, Wason rowed in Trial Eights in 1865 and 1866 and was Captain of Wadham College Boat Club. He was also winner of the University foils for 1868. Career Wason's chosen professions were the law and politics. He was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1870 and practised on the Northern Circuit. Whether he did not at first take to being a barrister or perhaps just to gain greater legal experience, in 1872 Wason was disbarred as a barrister at his own request in order to become a solicitor. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1876, becoming a partner in Williams, James & Wason until 1885. Again at his own request, Wason was struck off the Rolls in 1886, ceasing to be a solicitor, in order to gain readmission as a member of the Bar the following week. This was deemed a unique experience, Wason having been both disbarred and struck off the Rolls, but each time at his own request. From 1878‚Äì1882, Wason served as Assistant Examiner to the Incorporated Law Society in Common Law. PoliticsMP for South Ayrshire= Wason was first elected to Parliament at the 1885 general election for the constituency of Ayrshire South. This was his local seat as his home was at Blair, Dailly, a village in the county. He held the seat only until the 1886 election when he lost to a Liberal Unionist but regained it at the 1892 general election and then served as its MP until 1895 when he again forfeited the seat to a Liberal Unionist, Sir William Arrol.The Times, 29 July 1895 =MP for Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire= Wason returned to Parliament in December 1899. The sitting Liberal MP for Clackmannan and Kinross, J B Balfour became a judge and resigned his seat. Wason was selected as Liberal candidate and fighting the by-election against the background of the war in South Africa he managed to hold the seat, beating his Conservative opponent George Younger albeit by a marginally reduced majority of 516 ‚Äì down from 545 at the previous general election.The Times, 30 December 1899 After his by-election victory, Wason retained his Clackmannan and Kinross seat at the 1900 general election in a straight fight with the Conservatives by a majority of 351. In the Liberal landslide election of 1906 he increased his majority over the Conservatives to 1,379 and in January 1910 he maintained his advantage by a majority of 1,268. In December 1910 he was returned unopposed.The Times House of Commons 1911; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p109 By 1918 Wason was 72 years old and decided to retire from Parliament at the next election.The Times, 24 April 1918 He therefore stood down from Parliament at the 1918 election.The Times, 21 November 1918 =Scottish MP= Wason became a veteran MP, serving nearly 25 years in all. He was Chairman of the Scottish Liberal members for ten years from 1908 to 1918 and was always a keen supporter of Scottish interests. He spoke in Parliament in favour of Home Rule for Scotland.The Times, 19 July 1910 He presided at the meeting of Scottish Liberal members at the House of Commons which urged the government to implement the motion passed at the Scottish National Liberal Council at Dunfermline on 22 October 1910 which called for Home Rule to enable Scottish reforms to be carried through, adapted to the traditions, circumstances and aspirations of the Scottish people.The Times, 19 November 1910 He served as Honorary President of the Scottish Chamber of AgricultureThe Times, 2 September 1910 and later led a deputation of Scottish Liberal MPs to prime minister H H Asquith in his room at the House of Commons on 25 April 1912 urging the introduction of a Bill for Scottish self-government in the next Session.The Times, 7 May 1912 According to another source the delegation saw the prime minister again on 6 May 1912 and, while agreeing there was no groundswell of opinion in Scotland for home rule, there was ‚Äòconcern and disgruntlement at the general neglect of Scottish affairs‚Äô and they told Asquith they were worried this might escalate if not dealt with through an element of devolution.John Edward Kendle, Ireland and the Federal Solution: The Debate Over the United Kingdom Constitution, 1870‚Äì1921; McGill- Queen's University Press, 1989 p149 =Radical MP?= In the obituary of Wason written for The Times newspaper, he was described as a political Radical.The Times, 20 April 1927 He was said to be a frequent speaker in the House of Commons (unlike his brother Cathcart) and usually gave expression to advanced radical views. On one important radical issue of the day, women's suffrage, he himself claimed to have always voted in favour.Homer Morris, Parliamentary Franchise Reform in England from 1885 to 1918; Columbia University, 1921 p81 His support of Home Rule all Round was also indicative of radical sentiments. However, after he left Parliament, in the days when the old Liberal tradition was collapsing under the strains and stresses of party splits, the confusion of the electorate as to Liberal policy and the massive expansion of the electorate as a result of the Representation of the People Act 1918,York Membery, The Liberals‚Äô Last Hurrah; History Today, December 2008, Volume 58, Issue 12, pp8-9 Wason's radicalism was tested. At the general elections of 1923 and 1924 in Wason's home area of South Ayrshire no Liberal candidate could be persuaded to stand, leaving a straight fight between Labour and Conservative parties.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, 1969 p617 Faced with this choice at a time of polarisation in British politics, with Liberalism at a low ebb in AyrshireThe Times, 1 December 1923 Wason supported the Conservative.The Times, 29 October 1924 =Other political and public offices= In July 1902, Wason was appointed to be a member of the important Select committee on National Expenditure. Other members appointed at that time included Winston Churchill, Bonar Law and Austen Chamberlain.The Times, 7 July 1902 In 1907, Wason was created a Privy Councillor after which he was able to be termed The Right Honourable and was eligible to receive sensitive government information on highly confidential terms.The Times, 28 June 1907 In June 1915 he was appointed by the then Secretary for Scotland Thomas McKinnon Wood as Chairman of a Committee on Food Production in Scotland (under the auspices of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland) to make recommendations about maintaining and increasing food production on the assumption the war would last beyond the harvest of 1916.The Times, 24 June 1915 He also served as a member of the Committee on the Scottish National War Memorial. In 1917 he was made a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of AyrshireThe Times, 14 April 1917 and was for some years a Justice of the Peace in Ayrshire. Travel Wason enjoyed foreign travel throughout his life and twice went round the world; in 1886‚Äì87 by India, China, Japan, San Francisco, and America, and in 1896‚Äì97 by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, Vancouver, and Canada. His overseas vacationing landed him in serious difficulty at the outbreak of the First World War. In the summer of 1914, Wason was on holiday in the Spa resort of Marienbad (now called Marianske Lazne) in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Imperial province of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). He was detained there as an enemy alien until September when he was allowed to travel to neutral Switzerland along with 200 other British subjects who had been taking the waters there and at the other nearby Spa town of Karlsbad (now called Karlovy Vary). He arrived in Geneva on 4 September and from there returned to England.The Times, 6 September 1914 Burns Night, 1918 Wason attended a Burns Night dinner in honour of the Allied Nations at the Criterion Restaurant in London on 25 January 1918 as one of the guests of the London Robert Burns Club. Unfortunately however the guests had to do without the traditional dish of haggis. The haggis had been ordered but owing to the food restrictions in Scotland caused by the war, the necessary ingredients were not available. This was ironical in view of Wason's previous role as Chairman of the Committee on Food Production in Scotland. The guests had to make do with what The Times newspaper report of the event described as ‚Äòan Italian dish‚Äô (otherwise unspecified) but which was properly piped in by the bagpipes.The Times, 26 January 1918 Death Wason died at his London home in Sussex Gardens, Hyde Park on 20 April 1927 aged 81 years.

As of 2017 it is unclear if it affects a person's risk of death. GSK has announced that it intends to withdraw the drug from the worldwide market by July 2018 for economic reasons. Medical uses Albiglutide is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. It can be used alone (if metformin therapy is ineffective or not tolerated) or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, including insulins. According to a 2015 analysis, albiglutide is less effective than other GLP-1 agonists for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, an indicator for long-term blood glucose control) and weight loss. It also seems to have fewer side effects than most other drugs of this class, except for reactions at the injection site which are more common under albiglutide than, for example, under liraglutide. Contraindications The US approval lists the thyroid C cell cancers medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) as contraindications because other GLP-1 agonists are known to cause such cancers in rodents. Albiglutide causes immunogenicity in rodents, so its cancer risk could not be assessed.Drugs.com: on Tanzeum. The European approval mentions the uncertainty about C cell cancers, but not as a contraindication. Side effects Common side effects (in more than 10% of patients) in clinical trials were diarrhoea, nausea, and, unsurprisingly, hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels) and reactions at the injection site. Upper respiratory tract infections were also common, but only slightly more so than under placebo. Uncommon but potentially severe side effects included acute pancreatitis (in 0.3% of patients) and hypersensitivity reactions (in fewer than 0.1%). Interactions No clinically relevant interactions have been found in studies with a number of drugs that are known for their interaction potential (simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin, and oral contraceptives). Nonetheless, since albiglutide slows gastric emptying, it could conceivably increase absorption of other drugs if taken at the same time. PharmacologyMechanism of action= Albiglutide acts as an agonist at the GLP-1 receptor, which makes it a type of incretin mimetic. This causes an increase of insulin secretion, predominantly in the presence of high blood glucose, and also slows down gastric emptying. =Pharmacokinetics= Following subcutaneous injection, albiglutide reaches highest blood concentrations after three to five days. Steady-state concentrations are achieved after three to five weeks. The substance is most likely broken down by protease enzymes to small peptides and amino acids. Being resistant to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the enzyme that breaks down GLP-1, albiglutide has a biological half-life of five (four to seven) days, which is considerably longer than the older GLP-1 analogs exenatide and liraglutide. This allows for a once-weekly administration, unlike liraglutide but like the extended-release form of exenatide. Chemistry Albiglutide is a peptide consisting of 645 proteinogenic amino acids with 17 disulfide bridges. Amino acids 1‚Äì30 and 31‚Äì60 constitute two copies of modified human GLP-1, the alanine at position 2 having been exchanged for a glycine for better DPP-4 resistance.

Although the village is now a residential area, with its residents commuting to places such as the nearby towns of Blackburn and Darwen, in the 19th and early 20th century, local industries included weaving and coal mining. Between 1901 and 1936 the village was on a tram route operated by the local authorities of the two towns. Hoddlesden was also served by a railway line, a branch of the Ribble Valley Line north of Darwen. The line, opened by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1876, only had goods trains, as petitions by local residents for a passenger service were unsuccessful. The section that served Hoddlesden closed in 1950. A mill was operated by Vernon Carus, a manufacturer of healthcare products, until 2003.

History A view of the cliffs that overhang the faj√£ with cattle An older view of the settlement and lagoon of Faj√£ dos Cubres The spit received its name from the seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), a small yellow flowering plant, that is common to the faj√£. This species, common along the eastern coast of the United States, spread throughout many of the islands of the archipelago. The size of the faj√£ has been attributed to the 9 July 1757 earthquake, considered the most violent tectonic quake that occurred in the Azores.Amigos dos A√ßores (2013), p.16 This seismic event was characterized by violent movements of land (landslides, collapses and rockfalls) that were responsible for the creation of several faj√£s on the island, such as the Faj√£ of Ponta Nova, and the growth of pre-existing faj√£s. The event, and associated aftershocks, were responsible for the destruction in Faj√£ dos Vimes, Faj√£ do S√£o Jo√£o and Faj√£ dos C√∫beres, where \\"it moved the land, from the centre above, with luck, in them, there is no sign of buildings.\\"Amigos dos A√ßores (2013), p.17 The earthquake produced major damage in Calheta and caused the death of 1034 on the island of S√£o Jorge.Nunes et al. (2003), p.266-268 The Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Lurdes was open to the faithful on 18 October 1908. It was offered to the public by Ant√≥nio Faustino Nunes, a native of this faj√£ and later emigrant to California. To the rear of the church is a tidal well, who some believed its waters were considered miraculous. During the 1980 earthquake several buildings were damaged. Geography An aerial view of the faj√£ and cliffs that gave rise to its formation A view of the lagoon and the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Lurdes The faj√£ is an irregular form, with four small islets, and is heavily influenced by tidal waters, due to the diffusion of salt water into the lagoon. In comparison with the lagoon of the Faj√£ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, there is no canal to the sea, which affects the dynamic of this ecosystem. Morton (1998) identified two areas: one along the west, where the tidal waters rise between (and which the salinity is elevated between 10-26%) and the eastern section, where salinity levels are between 0-6%. This milder salinity even allows the survival of a small population of frog (Rana esculenta). Of the plants that exist at Faj√£ dos Cubres the predominant species include, the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), along the lagoon, Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota) and the Azorean spurge (Euphorbia azorica). The presence of estuary grasses (Ruppia maritima) within the lagoon is of great importance, since they were exceptional within the Azores (and only at this site). The faj√£ has a variety of typical marine flora and fauna, and its lagoon has become a natural refuge for diverse marine and migratory birds. Nesting birds include the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans atlantis) and the common tern (Sterna hirundo). In addition, annually, farmers bring cattle down to the faj√£ to graze. Although prohibited now, at one time fishing occurred in the lagoon, mostly mullet and anchovies, using netting techniques. The faj√£, which is part of Ribeira Seca, is west of the larger, Faj√£ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo. It is accessible by a winding road that descends the northern cliffs from the village of Norte Pequeno. Until 1993 this was a dirt roadway, and crossed many small bridges, where water drained from the plateau, but it was eventually asphalted by regional authorities. The settlement constitutes a unique countryside, with a mix of buildings with modern and older amenities. A primary school has at some times operated, based on the number of available students, with most children bused to the larger secondary schools on the plateau.

During the winter months, Sturgeon Bay is responsible for providing search and rescue capabilities to the ice-covered areas in New York City and the Hudson Valley, as well as throughout coastal New England. The cutter also facilitates the safe navigation of commercial product, including gasoline and heating oil, through the ice-choked Hudson River from New York City to Albany. All Bay-class cutters, including Sturgeon Bay, use a low-pressure-air hull lubrication or bubbler system that forces air and water between the hull and ice. This system improves icebreaking capabilities by reducing resistance against the hull, reducing horsepower requirements. In addition to ice breaking, Sturgeon Bay is heavily involved in providing waterside security for the port of New York/New Jersey, the busiest port on the East Coast. Sturgeon Bay is also responsible for monitoring vessel traffic, enforcing boating regulations for recreational and commercial vessels, and acting as lead security for high-profile events in the port.

He began his career aged 17, as a \\"bad boy\\" in the film To Sir With Love (1966), and in the classic BBC Doctor Who adventure The Web of Fear, as a soldier battling Yeti in the London Underground. In 1985 Whittaker took a director's training course, and directed a short training film which he sent to John Schlesinger (who had directed him in Yanks). Schlesinger suggested him to producer Mark Shivas as director for Channel 4's drama trilogy What If It's Raining?, written by Anthony Minghella. This was the beginning of a directing career of prestigious TV and film work. Shortly before Whittaker's death, writer Julian Fellowes spoke of him as, \\"the most exciting director in the industry.\\" In 2001 he filmed his final project The Rocket Post, a romantic drama set on a remote Scottish island. The film had severe funding problems, and was eventually released in 2006, three years after his death. The credits bear a dedication to his memory.

According to WorldCat, the book is in 2,133 libraries.WorldCat item recordThe book has been translated into Polish, Hebrew, Italian, German, and Korean. WorldCat summary  Plot synopsis  The book of Genesis tells the story of the slaying of Abel by his brother Cain; the world's first recorded murder. But the Bible does not say what weapon Cain used. That detail is lost to history. In 1932, Mitchell Siegel was killed by three gunshots to the chest. As a result, his son dreamed of a bulletproof man and co-created the world's greatest superhero: Superman. Like Cain's murder weapon, the gun used in this unsolved murder has never been found, until now. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Cal Harper comes face-to-face with his family's greatest secret: his long-lost father, who has been shot with a gun that traces back to Mitchell Siegel's 1932 murder. When Cal and his father are attacked by a ruthless killer tattooed with the ancient markings of Cain, he learns that the two murders, committed thousands of years apart, have something in common, setting off the hunt for the world's first murder weapon.

Tech. L. Rev. P1 The test was first articulated under its present form in the government's brief in Gottschalk v. Benson. In its reply brief on the merits in that case, the government said, \\"we submit that the cases follow such a rule‚Äîimplicitly or explicitly‚Äîand that they cannot be rationalized otherwise.\\"Reply Br. at 9. The court declined to adopt the proposed rule as categorical and as an exclusive test. It opined that future cases might present fact patterns calling for a different rule from that applicable to past cases, and therefore the machine-or-transformation test was just a \\"clue\\" to eligibility for a patent.The court said that \\"[a] process patent must either be tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or materials to a 'different state or thing.' We do not hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet the requirements of our . . . precedents.\\" The test has been recently articulated in Bilski,545 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 2008). See also In re Ferguson, 558 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009). but dates back to the nineteenth century.The Benson opinion explains several examples. In Corning v. Burden, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 252 252 (1853), the court stated that \\"[o]ne may discover a new and useful improvement in the process of tanning, dyeing, etc., irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device.\\" Id. at 267-68. The Benson court explained that the illustrative processes in Corning ‚Äî \\"the arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof cloth, vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores\\"‚Äîare instances where \\"the use of chemical substances or physical acts, such as temperature control, changes articles or materials. The chemical process or the physical acts which transform the raw material are, however, sufficiently definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds.\\" Benson, 409 U.S. at 69. In Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780 (1876), the court upheld a patent on a process for manufacturing \\"superfine\\" flour, although the claim was not limited to any particular form of machinery. Such a process \\"is a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\\" Id. at 788. The Benson court also explained Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U. S. 707 (1880), as a case in which the process transformed fat into glycerin by uniting a water molecule with a fat molecule. Benson, 409 U.S. at 70. The test is articulated also in the patent- eligibility trilogy‚ÄîGottschalk v. Benson,409 U.S. 63 (1972). Parker v. Flook,437 U.S. 584 (1978). and Diamond v. Diehr.450 U.S. 175 (1981). In the wake of the Supreme Court's opinion in Bilski v. Kappos, rejecting machine-or- transformation as the sole test of patent eligibility, and confirming that it is only a \\"useful clue,\\" it is now clear that this test is only a way to measure whether the patent claim in issue preempts substantially all applications of the underlying idea or principle on which a patent is based‚Äîsuch preemption being a far more basic and general test of patent eligibility or ineligibility.See Alice Corp. v. CLS Int'l Bank, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2357 (2014) (\\"A claim that recites an abstract idea must include 'additional features' to ensure 'that the [claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea].' \\"). Supreme Court has held that this is not the only test The Supreme Court has held Supreme Court Opinion that the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for the patent-eligibility of processes. The certiorari petition in Bilski challenged that proposition.See Bilski petition at 16-21, and the Supreme Court's Bilski opinion expressly rejected the Federal Circuit's declaration that it was the exclusive test to apply; despite a dissent on the proper rationale, the court was unanimous on this point. In Gottschalk v. Benson, the court expressly reserved the point and declined to adopt the test as exclusive, stating: > It is argued that a process patent must either be tied to a particular > machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or materials to a > \\"different state or thing.\\" We do not hold that no process patent could ever > qualify if it did not meet the requirements of our prior precedents.409 U.S. > at 71. The government had made an argument in its brief in Benson that the Court should so hold and that it was impossible to rationalize the case law any other way. The Court, in its ruling, refused or failed to agree with that argument.See Petitioner's Reply Brief on writ of certiorari in Benson, at 9 (\\"we submit that the cases follow such a rule ‚Äì‚Äì implicitly or explicitly ‚Äì‚Äì and that they cannot be rationalized otherwise\\"). Outstanding issues The Benson and Bilski opinions left important details of the machine-or- transformation test unexplained. The details include what kind of transformation is sufficient to confer patent-eligibility and what are the characteristics of a \\"particular machine\\" that confers patent-eligibility. =Transformation= Transformation of an article from one thing or state to another is said to be a clue to patent eligibility. Thus, in Benson, the court stated that \\"Transformation and reduction of an article \`to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim....\\" A hundred years earlier, the Court had said, \\"A process is ... an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\\"Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 787-788 (1877). > What is an article? The Benson opinion indicated that the article > had to be a physical object, such as a lump of rubber (to be transformed > from raw to cured state), a piece of leather (to be transformed from > untanned skin to tanned leather),As Benson explains, the vulcanization of > rubber and tanning of leather are examples of processes that can be carried > out \\"irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device,\\" > according to the decision in O'Reilly v.

In Flook the implementation was conceded to be conventional and no departure from the prior art. Therefore, the principle with or plus a conventional implementation was patent-ineligible. The Flook Court also cited and relied on the same principle as being illustrated in Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.,333 U.S. 127 (1948). in which the natural principle was implemented in a manner so trivial on its face that the patent on the implementing article of manufacture was tantamount to a patent on the natural principle.The inventor discovered desirable properties of certain bacteria and claimed as an invention a package consisting of the bacterial material put into a container in order to sell it. This aspect of the machine-or- transformation test remains to some extent an uncertain and controversial issue. For a time it was asserted that it remains \\"unclear whether tying a process to a general purpose computer is sufficient to pass the machine-or- transformation test.\\" But in 2014 the Supreme Court expressly held in the Alice case that simply adding to a claim \\"do it with a computer\\" could not make for patent eligibility. The Alice case and its progeny also cast doubt on the assertion that use of the \\"programmed computer claim format\\" overcomes the patent-eligibility problem.This claim format relies on the legal doctrine that a new program makes an old general purpose digital computer into a new and different machine. The issue is discussed in the article--the Old Piano Roll Blues (analogizing the argument to saying that putting a new piano roll into an old player piano turns the latter into a new machine). The Federal Circuit's Bilski opinion explicitly left the question unresolved.The Bilski opinion said: \\"We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, as well as the answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine.\\" In the opening words of the Benson opinion, however, this statement occurs: > Respondents filed in the patent office an application for an invention that > was described as being related \\"to the processing of data by program and > more particularly to the programmed conversion of numerical information\\" in > general purpose digital computers. . . . The claims were not limited to any > particular art or technology, to any particular apparatus or machinery, or > to any particular end use. They purported to cover any use of the claimed > method in a general purpose digital computer of any type.Benson, 409 U.S. at > 64. Accord Dann v. Johnston, 425 U.S. 219, 224 (1976). Arguably, this language disposes of the issue.Judge Rich so opined in his dissenting opinion in In re Chatfield, 545 F.2d 152, 161 (Ct. Cus. & Pat. App. 1976), cert. denied as untimely filed, 434 U.S. 875 (1977) (\\"I have turned to the competing contentions which were presented to the Supreme Court in Benson, to its decision that we erred in holding the claims statutory, which was our only holding, and have concluded that the members of the Court participating in that decision were unanimous in holding that programs for general-purpose digital computers, at least when claimed as a 'process,' are not within the meaning of that category of inventions in the statute. It is my own view that claiming as a 'machine'\\" instead of as a 'process' is no distinction at all because it is merely a drafter's choice.\\"). Some pre- and post-Bilski decisions of the PTO appellate board (BPAI) take the position that a programmed general-purpose digital computer is not a \\"particular machine,\\" and that corresponding Beauregard claims to an encoded medium are equally nonstatutory.See, e.g., Ex parte Mitchell (BPAI 2009)(\\"We see no reason why a 'computer readable medium' containing 'instructions' for the otherwise ineligible method should be treated any differently from the non-statutory method recited in [method] claim 1.\\"); Ex parte Cornea-Hasegan (BPAI 2009) (\\"[T]he recitation of a processor does not limit the process steps to any specific machine or apparatus.\\"); id. (\\"Limiting the claim to computer readable media does not add any practical limitation to the scope of the claim.\\"); Ex Parte Halligan (BPAI 2008); Ex parte Wasynczuk (BPAI 2008). In CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc.,\\\\-- F. Supp. --, 2009 WL 815448 (N.D. Cal Mar. 23, 2009). a California federal district court held that limitation of a process to implementation \\"over the Internet\\" does not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test. First, the Internet is not a \\"particular machine.\\" The Internet is an intangible abstraction. Second, the limitation to a particular technological environment is a mere field-of-use limitation, which does not suffice under sec. 101. Third, the use of the Internet does not impose meaningful limits on the preemptive scope of the claims. The same court held that a \\"Beauregard\\" claim directed to the instructions for performing a method that does not pass the machine-or-transformation test will also fail to pass that test. The court pointed out that the PTO appellate board had similarly interpreted Bilski.See Ex parte Cornea-Hasegan, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1557, 1561 (B.P.A.I. 2009). The subsequent Alice decision appears to have substantially resolved these questions in favor of a determination of patent ineligibility. An imperfectly resolved issue is whether the machine-or- transformation test is narrowly misnamed, since the relevant case law includes comparable implementations of natural-principle processes with other types of physical objects besides a machine. In Funk, on which Flook relied, the implementation of the natural principle was with a package ‚Äî an article of manufacture. There is no principled reason why a natural-principle process must be implemented physically with a machine and not with an article of manufacture or composition of matter.In Armour Pharmaceutical Co. v. Richardson Merrell, Inc., 396 F.2d 70, 74 (3d Cir. 1968), the natural principle was implemented by coating trypsin with an enteric coating to protect it from stomach acid ‚Äî a facially-trivial expedient. The implementation was either a composition of matter or an article of manufacture. In Neilson v. Harford, [1841] 151 ER 1266, patent-eligibility was based on the presence of a \\"receptacle,\\" i.e., a metal box, to which heat was applied. The court said, \\"In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the application of heat externally to the receptacle,\\" in order to implement the principle of the invention. This apparatus would appear to be an article of manufacture, rather than a machine, since it lacks interacting parts. The test explained in Bilski thus should be regarded as a physical object or transformation test or a device-or-transformation test. =Is satisfying the test a necessary condition for patent-eligibility, a sufficient condition, both or neither?= It is debatable whether the decision of the Federal Circuit in In re Bilski made the machine-or-transformation test a necessary condition for patent-eligibility, a sufficient condition, or both a necessary and sufficient condition. The Bilski opinion seems to declare a rule that a claimed invention is patent-eligible if and only if it satisfies the machine-or-transformation test. Both prongs of if-and-only-if have been challenged, and in its opinion on appellate review of the Federal Circuit's opinion the Supreme Court held that the machine-or-transformation test was only a helpful clue and not in itself dispositive. Method and apparatus for exercising a cat A commentator asserted that an example illustrating the proposition that satisfying the machine-or-transformation test is not a sufficient condition for patent-eligibility occurs in U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,872.R. Stern, Being Within the Useful Arts as a Further Constitutional Requirement for US Patent Eligibility, [2009] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 6, 12. This patent covers a method and apparatus (machine) for entertaining a cat by using a moving laser beam (relatively high technology). The method is implemented with a \\"particular machine\\"‚Äî\\"a rotating laser source mounted directly on a shaft driven directly by a motor mounted on a portable pedestal\\" (method claim 14). But it is debatable whether entertaining a cat may be considered a useful Art, and some may argue that this \\"discovery\\" is not the kind of discovery that the Patent Clause contemplates.The \\"useful Arts\\" requirement differs from the machine-or-transformation test in purpose and substance, in that the \\"useful Arts\\" requirement considers the kind of human endeavor on which a patent is sought, to exclude certain categories of endeavor, while the machine-or-transformation test seeks to filter out advances in thinking that are claimed so broadly and/or abstractly that they excessively preempt large fields of endeavor in a manner that risks hindering the progress of useful Arts. The latter test differs also in being instrumental and in no sense important in itself as a policy. Attempts have been made, also, to describe processes that fail to satisfy the machine-or- transformation test but nonetheless seem clearly to be patent-eligible. > A method of removing dirt from a soiled garment, comprising: > placing a soiled garment in flowing water; and > shaking said garment for at least five minutes. Case-Law Developments After > State Street and AT&T; (viewed Mar. 25, 2009). The question has been raised, also, whether beating the garment with a stick constitutes use of a \\"particular machine.\\"Id. See also accompanying illustration. That question is illustrated by the following hypothetical claim that is a variation on the preceding example: > A method of removing dirt from a soiled garment, comprising: > submerging a soiled garment in water; and > beating said garment for at least five minutes with a stick.Id. The point of this type of analysis is that the machine-or-transformation test does not work for all cases. There are some unusual outliers that satisfy the test but are patent-ineligible and some that do not satisfy the test but are patent-eligible. The Supreme Court's subsequent analyses in the Bilski and Alice cases confirms the inability of the machine-or-transformation test to cover all possible cases, as the foregoing examples suggest. Therefore, these \\"thought experiment\\" patent claims show that, while the machine-or- transformation test is a valuable and useful clue, as the Alice case states, and it may well cover most practical cases, it is neither a necessary nor sufficient test of patent eligibility. = The \\"corollaries\\" = Bilski points out, and the PTO recently emphasized in a memorandum to its Examining Staff, Guidance for Examining Process Claims in view of In re Bilski (\\"Guidance Memo\\"). that there are two \\"corollaries\\" to the machine-or-transformation test. First, a mere field-of-use limitation is generally insufficient to make an otherwise ineligible method claim patent-eligible.The Supreme Court so held in Flook, where the claim's limitation to use in a hydrocracking process was ineffective to confer patent-eligibility. Moreover, in Diehr, the Court stated that ineligibility under ¬ß 101 \\"cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment.\\" 450 U.S. at 190-91. The PTO Guidance Memo explains that \\"[t]his means the machine or transformation must impose meaningful limits on the method claim's scope [for it] to pass the test.\\" What makes a limitation meaningful is unstated, but perhaps that concept can be defined in terms of whether the limitation places only an insubstantial limitation on claim scope or preemptiveness. The second corollary is that insignificant extra-solution activity will not transform a patent ineligible principle into a patentable process.This corollary is also supported in Diehr and Flook. The Diehr Court said that \\"insignificant postsolution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\\" 450 U.S. at 191-92. See also Flook, 437 U.S. at 590 (\\"The notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance.\\"). The PTO Guidance Memo explains that \\"[t]his means reciting a specific machine or a particular transformation of a specific article in an insignificant step, such as data gathering or outputting, is not sufficient to pass the test.\\" It is unclear whether this concept would apply to such acts as gathering temperature data from thermocouples inside a mold or opening the lid of a mold upon the completion of a curing process. It is reasonable to assume that whether a given step is insignificant or central to a claimed process will be a controversial issue in post-Bilski cases testing the meaning of the machine-or-transformation test. =Possible interaction between the machine-or-transformation test and the exhausted combination doctrine= It has not yet been explored in litigation whether claiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination provides a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as nonstatutory subject matter. A so-called exhausted combination claim is one to a device in which a novel group of elements cooperates in a conventional manner with some old elements‚Äîfor example, a new kind of motor and an old disk drive.See Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006). Placing a process that fails the machine-or-transformation test in a machine environment overcomes the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by In re Bilski and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based.This expedient was suggested initially in Richard H. Stern, Tales From the Algorithm War, 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991). The format of the processes claimed in Diamond v. Diehr, Parker v. Flook, and Gottschalk v. Benson illustrate the concept and its practical application. In Diehr, the claim was to \\"a method of operating a rubber-molding press\\" using the Arrhenius equation, and the claim contained at least minimal references to the mold press and other apparatus. The Court held the claim patent-eligible. In Flook, the claim was to a \\"method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit,\\" where an \\"'alarm limit' was a number.\\" The claim said nothing about a chemical reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. The Court held the claim patent-ineligible. In Benson, the claim was to \\"a data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.\\" One claim mentioned a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentioned no apparatus at all. The Court held both claims patent-ineligible, however, on the ground that the computer-equipment limitation was too trivial to avoid preempting the idea, since the method could not feasibly be used except with a computer. In Flook, the claim could have instead been to \\"a method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is fed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.\\" The claim, although to an exhausted combination,The Court's opinion states that it was conceded that the process was known and conventional except for its use of the algorithm. would have required apparatus as did that in the Diehr case. Similarly, the claim in Benson could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary-coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a seemingly nontrivial mechanical environment, even though it was just an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter (patent-ineligibility). It is thus possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine-or-transformation test. The subsequent unanimous Supreme Court decisions in the Mayo and Alice cases, by reaffirming the doctrine of the Flook case, cast doubt on the likelihood of success of the drafting techniques described above. That doctrine is that a claim to the implementation of a principle that is patent ineligible in itself must be inventive rather than routine and conventional, in order to make that claim patent eligible.

(9 October 1812Birth date also found as 1 October; birth year also found as 1813. ‚Äì c. 7 September 1856) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement, a Mormon pioneer, and the first secretary and treasurer of the Territory of Utah. He was killed in a raid by Cheyenne Native Americans in Nebraska Territory while travelling on government business between Utah and Washington, D.C.

He graduated from Ohio State University at Cincinnati and became licensed to practice law in six states.Susan Easton Black, \\"The Choice\\", speech at Brigham Young University‚ÄìIdaho in Rexburg, Idaho, 2 November 2004. He married Julia Ann Johnson on 23 November 1833Johnson was the older sister of prominent Latter Day Saint Benjamin F. Johnson. and is thought to have joined the Latter Day Saint church sometime in 1833. In 1834, he was a member of Zion's Camp, and on 28 February 1835 he was ordained as one of the first seventies in the church by Joseph Smith, Jr. Babbitt later became a high priest in the church. In 1837 and 1838, Babbitt was a missionary for the church in Upper Canada. He attempted to move to Missouri in 1838 but was among the Latter Day Saints who were driven out by unfriendly residents, eventually settling in Nauvoo, Illinois. At a conference of the church in May 1839, Babbitt, Robert B. Thompson, and Erastus Snow were appointed to be a traveling committee that was charged with \\"gather[ing] up and obtain[ing] all the libelous reports and publications which had been circulated against the Church.\\"Joseph Smith (1902, B. H. Roberts ed.) History of the Church, vol. 3, p. 345. In 1841, Babbitt was appointed as the president of the church's Kirtland Stake, where he was charged with shepherding the Latter Day Saints who did not have the financial resources to move to Nauvoo. In 1843, Babbitt's tenure ended in Kirtland and he began actively practicing law in Nauvoo; he was frequently employed to defend Latter Day Saints in legal disputes. While in Nauvoo, Babbitt was also selected by Joseph Smith, Jr. to become a member of two select groups: the Anointed Quorum and Council of Fifty. In 1844, Babbitt was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. In February 1846, Babbitt, Joseph L. Heywood and John S. Fullmer were together given charge over the affairs of the church in Nauvoo after the departure of the church apostles. After the Battle of Nauvoo in September 1846, Babbitt and the two other men signed the treaty that \\"surrendered\\" the city of Nauvoo's charter. Utah political leader In 1848, Babbitt emigrated to Utah Territory to join the gathering of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), led by Brigham Young. In Utah, Babbitt, a Democrat, became involved in politics. In 1849, he was selected by the provisional General Assembly of the State of Deseret to travel to Washington, D.C. and petition for statehood on behalf of the Assembly.Milton R. Hunter (1946). Brigham Young the Colonizer (2004 reprint, Whitefish, Mont.: Kessinger Publishing, ) p. 126. Instead, the federal government created the Territory of Utah and in 1853 Babbitt was appointed secretary and treasurer of the territory. In this position, Babbitt had frequent clashes with Brigham Young, the territorial governor and the president of the LDS Church.Leonard J. Arrington (1986). Brigham Young: American Moses (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, ) p. 234‚Äì235. These clashes have been attributed in part to Babbitt's tendency to view himself as a representative of the United States federal government rather than an enabler of Young's pro-LDS Church policies. Babbitt led a company of Mormon pioneers to Utah in 1851.Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel, 1847‚Äì1868: Almon W. Babbitt Company (1851), churchofjesuschrist.org, accessed 2008-12-17. Conflict with Latter Day Saint leaders In addition to his clashes with Brigham Young, Babbitt was involved in a number of conflicts with Latter Day Saint leaders from his early days in the church. On 27 December 1833, Babbitt and his wife were summoned before a disciplinary council on an unspecified complaint; however, when the accusers failed to appear at the council, the charges were dismissed. On 19 August 1835, Babbitt brought before the church's high council on charges that included \\"not keeping the Word of Wisdom.\\"Joseph Smith (1902, B. H. Roberts ed.). History of the Church, vol. 2, p. 252. Babbitt admitted the offence of breaking the Word of Wisdom and stated \\"that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong.\\" The council \\"reproved\\" him and \\"instructed him to observe the Word of Wisdom, and commandments of the Lord in all things\\". On 28 December 1835, Joseph Smith, Jr. submitted a complaint before the church's high council that Babbitt had been \\"misrepresenting\\" him to a number of Latter Day Saints.\\"Minutes of December 28, 1835\\", Kirtland High Council Minutes (December 1832 ‚Äì November 1837). Babbitt claimed that Smith was angry with him because he had bested him in a debate. The council decided that Babbitt had spoken falsehoods against Smith; Babbitt confessed that he had \\"done wrong\\", but refused to confess that he had lied, and the matter was closed. Later, Babbitt was disfellowshipped from the church four separate times, in 1839, 1841, 1843, and 1851, but each time was restored to fellowship shortly thereafter.\\"Biographical Registers: BABBIT, Alman (Almon)\\" , BYU Studies, byu.edu, accessed 2008-12-17. In an 1841 revelation to Joseph Smith, Babbit is singled out for reproof for \\"aspir[ing] to establish his counsel ... [and] sett[ing] up a golden calf for the worship of my people.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 124:84 (LDS Church ed.). This was likely a result of Babbitt encouraging Latter Day Saints to settle and remain in the old church headquarters of Kirtland, where he was stake president, as opposed to encouraging Saints to move to Nauvoo, which had been designated by Smith as the new gathering place.Robert Bruce Flanders (1965). Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, ) pp. 249‚Äì253. The day before Joseph Smith, Jr. was killed in Carthage Jail, Smith instructed his uncle John Smith to \\"tell Almon W. Babbitt I want him to come and assist me as an attorney at my expected trial\\".Joseph Smith (1902, B. H. Roberts ed.). History of the Church, vol. 6, p. 598. Upon delivering the message a few hours later, Babbitt told John Smith that \\"You are too late, I am already engaged on the other side.\\"Joseph Smith (1902, B. H. Roberts ed.). History of the Church, vol. 6, p. 600. Murder victim In April 1856, Babbitt left Salt Lake City for Washington, D.C. on his twenty-second trip on government business from Utah to the capital. On August 31, 1856, Babbitt set out from Florence, in Nebraska Territory, for Salt Lake City. When he arrived at Ft. Kearny (not to be confused with present-day Ft. Kearny), Babbitt learned that his freight train of government property had been attacked and looted by Cheyenne Native Americans;\\"Utah War Chronology\\" , utahwar.org, accessed 2008-12-17.\\"Almon Whiting Babbitt (1812‚Äì1856)\\", babbitt.info, accessed 2008-12-17. two wagon drivers and a child were killed in the raid, and a Mrs. Wilson was taken hostage. She would later be redeemed near Ft. Laramie. Babbitt \\"stopped a week to gather up what could be found of the scattered property, purchased other teams, obtained drivers and start[ed] the train again\\". Babbitt traveled ahead of the team in a carriage with \\"two attendants\\", Frank Roland and a Mr. Sutherland. About 120 miles west of Ft. Kearny‚Äîat Ash Hollow on the Oregon Trail‚Äîthe three men were attacked on about August 10.On August 4, 1856, and 12 miles east of Ash Hollow near Pawnee Swamp and Rattlesnake Creek, a group of defecting Mormons‚Äîthe Margettses and Cowdys‚Äîhad also been attacked and murder by Cheyenne. Zelphia Noble Sheffield Margetts was taken hostage and never redeemed. The Cheyenne claimed that they killed her later when she was unable to keep up with the raiding party. Babbitt's obituary in the newspaper he had founded‚Äîthe Council Bluffs Bugle‚Äîdescribed how he was killed by a blow to the head by a tomahawk swung by a Cheyenne Indian. Because all three of Babbitt's party were killed, the information must have come from the Cheyennes themselves, or else it is fictional supposition.Fielding, Robert K, Unsolicited Chronicler (1993), p. 335. Upon hearing of his death, Brigham Young commented that Babbitt had \\"lived like a fool and died like a fool\\", causing some to suspect that Young or the Mormon Danites were somehow responsible for Babbitt's death.Norman F. Furniss (2005). The Mormon Conflict: 1850‚Äì1859 (New Haven: Yale University Press, ) pp. 41, 53.Stuart Martin (1920). Mystery of Mormonism (2003 reprint, Whitefish, Mont.: Kessinger Publishing, ) p. 106. However, it is possible that Young was simply continuing to express his long-standing dislike of Babbitt: in October 1856, Young told the Utah Territorial Legislature, \\"If Almon Babbitt were here‚Äîthank God he is not‚Äîhe would have found fault with everything.\\" Family Babbitt and his wife Julia were the parents of six children, four of which survived to adulthood. Babbitt also practiced plural marriage.

His greatest success as a playwright came in 1896 with the premiere of his adaption of The Prisoner of Zenda. He later adapted other works of Anthony Hope, but none reached the same level of success. He married Elizabeth Ann Gould, and had two daughters, Lucy and Dorothy. His elder daughter, Lucy, died when she was ten, and in her memory Rose endowed a research post at the London School of Economics and paid for the education of a board school girl. He served for a while as the Vice-President of the Playgoer's Club, and was a member of the Fabian Society.

He regularly tours with the band whenever they visit Latin America, and is also featured on several of the group's singles beginning with the B-side of 2005's Meiky≈´ no Prisoner.  Early life  In the mid-1990s to early 2000s, Cruz worked as a musician in Brazil, his native homeland. He also worked as a journal writer, typically translating from Japanese to Portuguese and English. He speaks Portuguese and Japanese fluently. In 2003, he met JAM Project's current leader, Hironobu Kageyama at the largest anime convention in Brazil, Anime Friends. Hironobu expressed interest in Ricardo's voice, and gave him a demo. The demo track later won him a position in JAM Project as a secondary member.  Career  Ricardo participated in-studio with JAM Project for the first time in 2005, starting with Neppu Cybuster Shippu!. In 2006, he performed as part of the group with the original leader Ichirou Mizuki on another single, Stormbringer. Shortly after in 2007, he shared the stage for the first time in the group's fourth live concert, JAM Project JAPAN CIRCUIT 2007 Break-Out. He wrote the lyrics for the song \\"Sempre Sonhando ~Yume Oibito~\\" on JAM Project's 6th best album in 2006, Get over the Border. In 2009 he collaborated with Wada Kouji to produce a song in Japanese and Portuguese. On September 17, 2010, Ricardo joined up with JAM Project once more for their Reunion concert, where the original members sang with the current members. Ricardo returned to work with JAM Project in Japan in late 2011 and early 2012 for their Go! Go! GOING!! world tour. He wrote the track Cross World on Hironobu Kageyama's 2012 album Rock Japan. In June 2014 started a YouTube channel called MugenLab where he talks about his trips to Japan and his career.

For many years during the exciting dance band and jazz era of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, Art Christmas was often said to be Britain's leading saxophone player and multi-instrumentalist. In the 1930s and 1940s, young musicians in their teens and early twenties would follow Art all over Britain listening to him play and trying to copy his style, especially on alto saxophone.http://www.jabw.demon.co.uk/art03.htm  Beginning  Art's professional music career really started when he was 19 years old. He left Canada to play trumpet with the Orchestra, touring all over the United States and then on to Britain. While in Britain, he was given the opportunity to play trumpet with Paul Specht's Canadian Club Orchestra in 1926 and really never looked back. The Melody Maker Magazine detailed this orchestra's strengths by saying: \\"A ten-piece combination, its members, who are all Canadians, between them account for thirty-five different instruments. There are three vocalists in the outfit. Art Christmas, the first trumpet, is also a red-hot 'dirt' sax player.\\"http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/dancebands/Musicians/MusicianPages/Art%20Christmas.htm Still in Britain, Art went on to play with the New Prince's Toronto Band also in 1926. This band was the resident band at the New Prince's restaurant in Piccadilly.Memory Lane No. 45 ‚Äì New Prince's article written by Vince Egan The band was made up of fellow Canadians and was directed by Hal Swain. It was when Hal Swain left the band, that at Alfie Noakes' behest, Art joined and took Hal Swain's place. The band was about to embark on a continental tour but first took some time fulfilling a recording contract again for Columbia. The publication British Dance Bands on RecordBritish Dance Bands on Record ‚Äì by Brian Rust and Sandy Forbes shows Art playing tenor sax but he doubled on alto sax and trumpet. This band had recorded about 50 titles since November 1924, but just one more session took place on February 25, 1926, while Art was with them. The band actually left for the continent in August 1926 and by now consisted of Dave Caplan (banjo), Les Allen (clarinet, tenor sax), Ken Kenney (drums), Art Lousley (trumpet), Jack Collins (trombone), John Whittaker (bass), Laurie Day (piano) and of course Art Christmas who played mostly alto sax but doubled on tenor sax, clarinet, trombone and trumpet.(This likely started Art thinking of trying to make a name for himself as a multi instrumentalist even as early as the 1920s). Eventually this band became known as \\"The Toronto Band from Canada, featuring Art Christmas\\" and from about the first week in September they played at the Faun des Westens in Berlin. During November they also appeared at The Scala Theatre, assisting the dance pair Annette Mills and Bobby, who were demonstrating the Charleston dance. While in Berlin, Germany, the band recorded about 56 titles for Deutsche Grammophon/Polydor. This band had a very strong jazz component thanks mainly to Art Christmas' style. The German discographer Horst Lange compared it to the California Ramblers in his \\"Jazz in Deutschland: die deutsche Jazz- Chronik\\", noting that Art Christmas and other members of the band were familiar with all styles and could play with this special 'American feeling' which pure European musicians and bands were lacking. One of this band's few surviving recordings \\"I'm Sitting On Top Of The World\\", is a vigorous effort in the \\"hot dance\\" genre and according to the book 'The Lost History Of Jazz In Canada by Mark Miller',The Lost History of Jazz In Canada (Such Melodious Racket)- by Mark Miller \\".......is distinguished by Art Christmas' alto saxophone solo.\\" Horst Lange's book Discography Of German Dance MusicDiscography of German Dance Music ‚Äì by Horst Lange shows the personnel of the band changing considerably, with only Art Christmas, Les Allen, Dave Caplan and Ken Kenney remaining from the band which left Britain. Art worked extensively in Britain and Europe during the late 1920s and led his own band in Budapest, Berlin and London. He was with the Savoy Orpheans for a brief time and then joined Billy Mason in 1930. Art played and recorded with Percival Mackey and Dave Frost during the latter half of 1931 and was now playing baritone sax as well as the other instruments with these groups.  Art's big break  Art's big break came when he joined the Roy Fox Band in February 1933, staying with this band until 1938.The Dance Band Era ‚Äì by Albert McCarthy It was while he was with The Roy Fox Band, that Art Christmas became a household name around the music scene in both Britain and Europe. The British music magazine Melody Maker referred to Art as \\"...the most sought after musician in England\\" and Art soon became billed as Britain's 'Leading sax and multi-instrumentalist' as he not only played lead alto sax for Roy Fox but was often featured on trumpet, trombone, xylophone, drums, piano and even a routine with the bagpipes and sousaphone.....He didn't just play these other instruments but mastered them nearly to the same degree as he had the alto sax and clarinet. \\"Art Christmas' alto sax playing is distinguished by a daringly virtuoso style and inventive technique that displays a harmonic and rhythmic sophistication well in advance of his time....................\\"Melody Maker Magazine 1938 After Roy Fox was forced to disband due to health problems in 1938, Art worked with Arthur Rosebery from 1938 to 1939, Sid Millward's \\"Nitwits\\" and Joe Ferrie in 1939, before joining Jack Jackson (playing with the Jackson band on one recording session in November of that year).Who's Who of British Jazz ‚Äì by John Chilton From 1940 until late 1946, Art played with his dear friend Jack Payne. The Jack Payne band was just too busy (with BBC shows every week and public performances all over Britain) to do much recording between 1940 and 1944 but there was a session in 1945 that Art played.  For The Fun of It  After Jack Payne turned impresario and launched a new variety show called \\"For The Fun of It\\", he asked Art to join up with Donald Peers, Frankie Howerd and Max Bygraves along with many other entertainers. Thus Art's multi instrumentalist stage act began and Art teamed up with his wife Maisie (a dancer and show girl), and \\"For The Fun of It\\" opened at the Sheffield Empire in Sheffield for sixteen weeks, followed by a different major city every week.Max Bygraves, I Wanna Tell Ya A Story ‚Äì by Max Bygraves  Command Performance  After the extensive run of \\"For The Fun of It\\", Art did some ice shows and some Pantomimes and also led his own \\"Foulharmonic Orchestra\\" for the show \\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\". One of Art's fondest memories was the performance of \\"Cinderella\\" for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the Palladium in London.  Warburton Arms  In 1952, Art was searching for his next adventure and much to the disappointment of his many fans decided to retire from show business and become a publican. He bought \\"The Warburton Arms\\" (now known as London Fields) an east end pub in Hackney, London. Art had been away from his mother and father for nearly 30 years and soon after he bought the pub in Hackney, his father died. In 1954, determined not to let his mother die without seeing her again, Art sold the pub and moved back to Canada with his wife Maisie and son Art Jr.  Canada 1954  After returning to Canada, Art performed a great deal around Kingston and Toronto with his own band from 1955 to 1958 when he decided to try his hand at teaching music at the high school level. He moved to Blind River, Ontario, again with his wife Maisie and his son Art, and taught until his death in 1961 in both Blind River, Ontario and Elliot Lake, Ontario. Although Art was enjoying his new teaching career a great deal, he still had the desire and drive to play. This time he played in and around Elliot Lake, Ontario and for the first time Art Jr. was at his side. The experience of playing with his 15-year-old son was the biggest thrill Art had ever experienced in his entire musical career. This experience was short lived however. Art died a year later.

The group was founded in 1998 in response to section 568 of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. History In response to several prestigious colleges and universities holding \\"Overlap Meetings\\" to set similar tuition and financial aid levels, the Justice Department began an antitrust investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed a Sherman Antitrust Act suit against 57 colleges and universities. While the Ivy League institutions settled, MIT contested the charges on the grounds that the practice was not anticompetitive because it prevented bidding wars over promising students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships and ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students. MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department settled the case in 1994. In 1994, Congress passed the Improving America's Schools Act. Section 568 of this Act expands upon the issues in the MIT settlement. Section 568 states that is not unlawful under the antitrust laws for two or more need-blind institutions to agree or attempt to agree: # to award financial aid only on the basis of need; # to use common principles of analysis for determining need; # to use a common aid application form; and # to engage in a one-time exchange of certain pre-award data of commonly admitted financial aid students. The amendment specifically prohibits the sharing of any information on the amount or terms of any prospective, individual aid award and makes clear that the exemption does not apply to the awarding of federal financial aid.

In early 1984, after changing their name to Final Warning, Tim Paul switched to bass and Jeff Paul (no relation) joined the group on vocals. This would become the classic Final Warning line-up that would remain until the band disbanded in 1986. (Poison Idea drummer Steve \\"Thee Slayer Hippie\\" Hanford did play several shows with Final Warning on second guitar in 1986.) Final Warning released one self-titled 7\\" E.P. on Poison Idea guitarist Tom \\"Pig Champion\\" Roberts' label, Fatal Erection Records in 1984.https://files.nyu.edu/cch223/public/usa/finalwarning_main.html The following year Final Warning had a song (\\"I Quit\\") on the Drinking is Great Portland punk compilation E.P. (also released by Fatal Erection). Final Warning would share the bill with many notable bands during their career. Among them: Dead Kennedys, The Exploited, Charged GBH, H√ºsker D√º, Minutemen and Mercyful Fate, but they never played outside the Pacific Northwest. Members of Final Warning would go on to play in other Pacific Northwest bands, including: Napalm Beach, Poison Idea, The Obituaries, Big House, Gruntruck, Zipgun, Kill Sybil and the Seattle-based Nightcaps. In June 2007, Southern Lord records released a 16 song compact disc that featured all the band‚Äôs studio material and 11 songs recorded live in 1985 at the Starry Night in Portland, Oregon (where Final Warning opened for Danish black metal band Mercyful Fate at their first U.S. concert). In September 2008, Final Warning played two shows with the classic line-up. The first show was in Seattle, Washington on September 6, 2008 at the Funhouse, followed by a show in Portland, Oregon at Satyricon, on September 20, 2008. On March 3, 2013, Jeff Paul died in a motorcycle crash in Portland, Oregon. In February 2015 Portland, Oregon-based Black Water Records released Demonstration 1983, a 9 song E.P. of Final Warning's first demo recordings. Influences Final Warning was primarily influenced by early 1980s U.S. West Coast hardcore (Germs, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Crucifix, Iconoclast, and Circle Jerks) and the second wave of English punk (Discharge, Charged GBH, Disorder and The Exploited). What set Final Warning apart from other hardcore bands of the period was the merging of heavy metal into their sound (bands like Metallica, Mot√∂rhead, Venom and early M√∂tley Cr√ºe.) Final Warning would combine these influences to become one of the early bands to combine punk and metal. The most common lyrical focus of Final Warning's music was their stand against violence and war. Final Warning picked up on many of the anti-war themes that the U.K. band Discharge used and expanded them to include their own take on the conformity, complacency and militarism in the United States during the Reagan era.

She is the first and current Chancellor of Sheridan College. McCallion was first elected in November 1978, and is the longest-serving mayor in the city's history, having served for 36 years at the time of her retirement in 2014. She was a successful candidate in 12 municipal elections, having been acclaimed twice and re-elected 10 other times. Her supporters gave her the nickname \\"Hurricane Hazel\\" because of her outspoken political style. Personal life McCallion was born in the community of Port Daniel, Quebec on the Gasp√© Coast of Quebec. Her father, Herbert Armand Journeaux (1879‚Äì1944), owned a fishing and canning company. Her mother, Amanda Maude Travers (1876‚Äì1955), was a homemaker and ran the family farm. The family also comprised two older sisters and two older brothers. After graduating from Quebec High School, she attended business secretarial school in Quebec City and Montreal. She has stated, especially while receiving university honours, that she would have wanted to attend university, but her family could not afford it. After beginning her career in Montreal with the Canadian Kellogg company, she was transferred to Toronto in 1942, where she helped set up the local office. McCallion left the business world in 1967 to devote her life to a career in politics. As a volunteer, McCallion also served as president of the Anglican Young People's Association of Canada, and later, provided leadership as a district commissioner with the Girl Guides of Canada in the early 1960s. She met her future husband, Sam McCallion (1923‚Äì1997), at an Anglican Church congregation in Toronto in 1951; they married on September 29 of that year. As a marriage present from McCallion‚Äôs in-laws, a piece of land was given to the newlyweds near the village of Streetsville, Ontario, to which they moved in December 1951. Before entering politics, she and her husband founded The Streetsville Booster in 1964. McCallion has three children. In 1997, her husband died of Alzheimer's disease. Political careerEarly years= McCallion began her political career in Streetsville. Her first campaign was in 1964 for the position of deputy reeve. It was unsuccessful, and she later considered herself to be a victim of dirty tricks. Having later been appointed as the chairman of the Streetsville Planning Board, she was elected as deputy reeve in the 1967 election and was appointed reeve in 1968. She was elected as Streetsville's mayor in 1970, serving until 1973. The Town of Streetsville was amalgamated with the Town of Mississauga and the Town of Port Credit to form the City of Mississauga at the beginning of 1974. McCallion advocated unsuccessfully to preserve Streetsville as a separate municipality. In the 1976 municipal election, McCallion won her seat on Mississauga council by acclamation. By the time she was elected mayor of Mississauga, she had sat on virtually every committee in Peel Region and the City of Mississauga. She has also served on the executive of many federal and provincial committees and associations. =Mayor of Mississauga= Mississauga City Hall McCallion was first elected mayor in 1978, defeating popular incumbent Ron Searle by about 3,000 votes. She had been in office only a few months when the 1979 Mississauga train derailment occurred, where a Canadian Pacific train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in a heavily populated area near Mavis Road. A large explosion and fire ensued as hazardous chemicals spilled. McCallion, along with the Peel Regional Police and other governmental authorities, oversaw the evacuation of the city. Despite having sprained her ankle, she continued to hold press conferences and update briefings. There were no deaths or serious injuries during the week-long emergency, and Mississauga gained renown for the peaceful evacuation of its then 200,000 residents. During McCallion's terms in office, Mississauga grew from a small collection of towns and villages to one of Canada‚Äôs largest cities, much of which occurred after the 1976 election of Ren√© L√©vesque's Parti Qu√©b√©cois government sparked an exodus of Anglophones and corporations from Montreal to the Greater Toronto Area. McCallion was easily elected throughout her career as mayor, with no serious challengers coming close to unseating her. She never campaigned during elections and refused to accept political donations, instead asking her supporters to donate the money to charity. Her final term as mayor, won in the election of October 2010, was her twelfth consecutive term. She announced during her final term that she would not be running for re-election in the 2014 municipal elections and endorsed councillor and former federal MP Bonnie Crombie to replace her as Mayor. Crombie defeated former city councilor, Member of Provincial Parliament and federal cabinet minister Steve Mahoney to win the 2014 municipal election. In 2012, McCallion was the third highest paid mayor in Canada, with a salary of $187,057. In a first-person account for Canadian magazine Confidence Bound, McCallion credited her faith with giving her energy, and said she still does her own household chores. \\"Housework and gardening are great forms of exercise and keep one humble.\\" On her 90th birthday in 2011, McCallion was assessed by Dr. Barbara Clive, a geriatrician, who stated that \\"at 90 her gait is perfect, her speech is totally sharp and she has the drive to still run this city. She‚Äôs the poster child for seniors\\". =Conflict of interest allegations= In 1982, McCallion was found guilty of a conflict of interest on a planning decision by the Ontario High Court of Justice due to not absenting herself from a council meeting on a matter in which she had an interest. In 1983, The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act would have required her to vacate her seat and prohibited her from running for the following term. In 2009, McCallion was the focus of public opinion when it was alleged that she failed to disclose a conflict of interest when attending meetings that concerned her son's company, World Class Developments Ltd. On October 3, 2011, Judge Douglas Cunningham found McCallion \\"acted in a 'real and apparent conflict of interest' while pushing hard for a real estate deal that could have put millions of dollars in her son's pocket.\\" On June 14, 2013, charges under the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act were dismissed as World Class Developments did not have a financial interest as defined under the Act, and the application was also statute-barred. In a later ruling concerning costs, Judge J. Sproat said, \\"Out of seven major issues, Mayor McCallion was successful on only three. On two of the three issues Mayor McCallion was successful, not because of any prudence or diligence, but only because World Class Developments‚Äôs project had not progressed at a faster pace.\\" =Political views= While party preferences are not usually expressed in Canadian municipal politics, McCallion supports the Liberal Party at the federal and provincial levels, and was asked in 1982 to consider running for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. She endorsed Kathleen Wynne on the convention floor of the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election, and later endorsed her and her party in the 2014 Ontario general election. Otherwise, McCallion has been described as a small-c conservative. McCallion endorsed Liberal leader Justin Trudeau for the 2015 election. She also appeared in a notable television advertisement for the federal Liberals during the final days of the 2015 election. In the 2018 Ontario provincial election, McCallion endorsed PC leader Doug Ford who later went on to become Premier of Ontario. In 2007, McCallion responded to the federal government's refusal to give any of the GST to cities, a funding source long requested by many municipalities across Canada, by planning a 5 per cent surcharge on property taxes in the city. She was able to have the levy introduced and approved on the same day by Mississauga council. Most media coverage, as well as Toronto mayor David Miller, noted that McCallion was arguably one of the few mayors in the country with the political capital to implement such a strategy. In the 2018 provincial election, McCallion both endorsed Liberal cabinet minister Charles Sousa's bid for re-election in Mississauga and endorsed the Progressive Conservatives at the provincial level. After politics McCallion at the Church of the Virgin Mary and Saint Athanasius in Mississauga in 2019. In November 2015, McCallion was appointed the Chief Elder Officer (CEO) of Revera Inc., to provide advice and counsel to the senior living sector company. In September 2011, Sheridan College opened the doors to its Hazel McCallion Campus in Mississauga, which was greatly expanded in 2018, more than doubling its enrollment. Furthering her ties with the college, in 2016, McCallion was named Sheridan's first chancellor, as part of its bid to attain university status. In February 2015, McCallion became a special advisor to the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM), the Mississauga campus of the University of Toronto, providing advice on matters related to strategic development of the school. In 2016, February 14 was renamed Hazel McCallion Day across the province of Ontario in honour of McCallion's birthday. In January 2019, Ontario Premier Doug Ford appointed McCallion as a special adviser. Although she has yet to formally accept the position she is exploring the idea and wants more details before formally accepting the Premier's appointment. She would also be an adviser to the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Steve Clark, and receive up to per year.

She is a founder and honorary co-chair of the Greater Toronto Marketing Alliance. In 1996, McCallion was appointed to the \\"Who Does What\\" panel. She was also appointed to two sub-panels: Assessment and Property Taxation Reform, and Emergency Services.

McCallion provided assistance for Don Cherry‚Äôs group to bring an Ontario Hockey League franchise to the city in 1998, and she was instrumental in bringing the IIHF Women‚Äôs World Hockey Championships to the city in 2000. =International politics= McCallion was one of the first Canadian politicians to openly support the creation of a Palestinian state. Addressing the annual convention of the Canadian Arab Federation in 1983, she argued that Palestinian issues had been distorted by the national media and was quoted as saying, \\"The Palestinians need and require and deserve a country of their own. Why shouldn't they get it?\\" =Other= In April 2006, a police standoff involving a distraught man threatening to kill himself ended after five hours when McCallion appeared on the scene and demanded he stand down so that police, paramedic, and fire personnel could attend to more important matters.

The collection was published in English under the title The Execution of Mayor Yin and Other Stories from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978. Tr. by Nancy Ing and Howard Goldblatt. The English language translation attained wide recognition, as its publication occurred at a time when U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China, the death of Mao Tse-tung, and the thaw in diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China all generated widespread interest in China in the United States. A revised edition of the book with a new introduction by Perry Link was re-issued by Indiana University Press in 2004.  Context  The Execution of Mayor Yin contains stories set during the period of the Cultural Revolution in China, approximately 1965-1975.  Themes  Major themes of the stories in the collection include freedom vs. conformity, disillusion, bewilderment, disgust, and being \\"out of place.\\"  Motifs  Major motifs include the steady stream of political campaigns and the Cult of Mao, as well as many quintessential features of life in China and of Chinese culture. A leitmotif running through the stories is the United States. Chen Ruoxi lived in the United States for a period, and many of the characters in her stories remark on contrasts between their experiences in the United States and in China, as well as between their expectations of life in the \\"new\\" China and what they observe of the \\"real\\" China.  Short Stories Synopses  The Execution of Mayor Yin consists of eight stories: * The Execution of Mayor Yin * \\"Chairman Mao is a Rotten Egg\\" * Night Duty * Residency Check * Jen Hsiu-lan * The Big Fish * Keng Erh in Peking * Nixon's Press Corps Brief synopses follow. = The Execution of Mayor Yin = During a visit to a rural area outside of Xi'an, the narrator sees how political violence during the Cultural Revolution finds escalates through a series of victims, culminating in \\"Mayor Yin\\" -- \\"Yin Xianzhang\\" or more literally \\"county magistrate\\" Yin. Some of the characters in the story conclude that there is simply no way to understand all of the political campaigns, or to see their consequences in any logical framework. The alludes to one of Mao Tse- tung's most famous speeches: Serve the People. The speech is about finding meaning in life by sacrifice. = \\"Chairman Mao is a Rotten Egg\\" = In this story, adults discover the absurd ends that a child's indiscretion can lead in the context of the Cult of Mao. = \\"Night Duty\\" = An idealistic teacher from Taiwan, who has also lived in the United States, now lives and works in China. In the course of service on a rural farm associated with his school in Nanjing‚Äîa variant on the Down to the Countryside Movement‚Äîhe makes some discouraging observations. These include a former book lover who has given up on books, and members of the \\"red\\" (proletariat) class who steal from the community. = \\"Residency Check\\" = This story turns on accusations of infidelity made against the narrator's (female) neighbor. = \\"Jen Hsiu-lan\\" = A (woman) political prisoner makes an \\"escape.\\" The story is highly symbolic, with pastoral scenes of children combing a hillside‚Äîin search of the escaped prisoner. The \\"escapee\\" turns out to have drowned herself - in a cesspool. Mao Tse-tung's speech, Serve the People, is alluded to again in this story. A theme of the story is women's liberation (or lack of it) in the \\"new\\" China. = \\"The Big Fish\\" = A man enjoys the sensual thrill of hunting down, negotiating for, and purchasing a small luxury - a large fish of a kind seldom available‚Äîfrom his local market. His joy is short-lived when he is told that the fish must be returned, in order to preserve the appearance of abundance for visiting reporters. = \\"Keng Erh in Peking\\" = This story describes the life of a Chinese man who, after living in the United States for twenty years, moves to China. The story takes place in Peking. It tells about two relationships that the protagonist has had with women, and how both relationships were thwarted by class struggle campaigns taking place throughout China at that time. = \\"Nixon's Press Corps\\" = U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China forms the backdrop of this story. The story describes how in one particular neighborhood in the southern Chinese city of Nanjing, all residents are encouraged/required to take down their drying racks in order to make a favorable impression on visiting foreigners. In the story, the narrator resists pressure from the leaders of her community, and reflects on the extremes of control in the society.

In addition, they played major roles in the Voyager series, and serve as the way home to the Alpha Quadrant for the isolated Federation starship USS Voyager. The Borg have become a symbol in popular culture for any juggernaut against which \\"resistance is futile\\", a common phrase uttered by the Borg. Depiction The Borg are cyborgs, having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings they do not consider an immediate threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthesis, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for myriad purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost zombie-like appearance. Some Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans, able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run, instead moving in a deliberate fashion, never retreating. Borg are highly resistant to energy- based weapons, having personal shielding that quickly adapts to them. In various episodes, phasers and other directed energy weapons tend to quickly become ineffective as the Borg are able to adapt to the specific frequencies on which these weapons are projected once a ship or an individual drone is struck down by them. Later attempts to modulate phaser and other weapon frequencies have had limited success. Borg shields are ineffective protection against projectile or melee weapons, and several have been defeated in this way, or through hand-to-hand combat. Borg possess a \\"cortical node\\" that controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body; it is most often implanted in the forehead above the organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel. =Borg Collective= An occupied Borg \\"alcove\\" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum Borg civilization is based on a hive or group mind known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated subspace network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness gives them the ability not only to \\"share the same thoughts\\", but also to adapt quickly to new tactics.\\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\\" (Star Trek: The Next Generation) Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \\"voice\\" is sometimes transmitted to ships. =\\"Resistance is futile\\"= Individual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \\"resistance is futile\\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be assimilated and its \\"biological and technological distinctiveness\\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film. The complete phrase used in Star Trek: First Contact is: =Nanoprobes= Nanoprobes are microscopic machines that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes maintain the Borg cybernetic systems and repair damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed and protect them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human red blood cell, travel through the victim's bloodstream and attach to individual cells. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular DNA, altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body, like electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \\"Mortal Coil\\", Seven of Nine says the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \\"Species 149\\". In addition, the nanoprobes maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, imparting regenerative capabilities. Though used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship Voyager in many instances as medical aids. The capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the Voyager episode \\"Drone\\", where Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter which uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th- century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones. The Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which they come into contact; Borg drones tend to completely ignore individuals that are identified as too weak to be an imminent threat or too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film Star Trek: First Contact while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Mortal Coil\\", Seven of Nine told Neelix the Kazon were \\"unworthy\\" of assimilation and would serve only to detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection. =Travel= The Borg are a spacefaring race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \\"Borg Cube\\" due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the Next Generation episode \\"QWho?\\" set in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed warp and transwarp drives, self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, adaptability in combat, and various energy weapons as well as tractor beams and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube As with most other Star Trek races, the Borg also have transporter capability. =Assimilation= Assimilation is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \\"You will be assimilated\\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the galaxy. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon first contact, humanity being \\"Species 5618\\". When first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders assimilating starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the Kazon, to be technologically inferior and unworthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \\"QWho?\\" shows that the Borg will assimilate even children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones. Patrick Stewart as Locutus of Borg, the assimilated Jean-Luc Picard In their second appearance, \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", they capture and assimilate Captain Jean-Luc Picard into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \\"he who has spoken\\", in Latin). The method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in Star Trek: The Next Generation, assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In Star Trek: First Contact and Star Trek: Voyager, assimilation is through injection of nanoprobes into an individual's bloodstream via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \\"irrelevant\\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In Star Trek: First Contact an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants. The Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in QWho? we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe, or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes. Some species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobes. Species 8472 is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the Hirogen, have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as Dr Phlox, who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\".Star Trek: Voyager, season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 & 2) Concept The Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy which had been lacking during the first season of TNG; the Klingons were allies and the Romulans mostly absent. The Ferengi were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to capitalist accumulation by free enterprise failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the TNG and Voyager eras of Star Trek. In Voyager episode \\"Q2\\", even Q tells his son, \\"Don't provoke the Borg.\\" Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season1 episode, \\"Conspiracy\\", which introduced a coercive, symbiotic life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \\"The Neutral Zone\\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the Enterprise crew in \\"QWho?\\".text commentary by Michael Okuda in the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact Borg Queen Alice Krige as the Borg Queen in Star Trek: First Contact Before the film Star Trek: First Contact (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. First Contact introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself with \\"I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by Alice Krige in this film and in the 2001 finale of Star Trek: Voyager, \\"Endgame\\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \\"Dark Frontier\\" (1999) and \\"Unimatrix Zero\\" (2000), but was portrayed by Susanna Thompson.https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml Whether or not these appearances represent the same queen is never confirmed. The queen was killed in both First Contact and \\"Dark Frontier\\", so there may be a total of three queens throughout the series. In First Contact, the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying she was present during the events of \\"Best of Both Worlds\\". The Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \\"order to chaos\\", referring to herself as \\"we\\" and \\"I\\" interchangeably. In First Contact, the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by Star Trek: Voyager, where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of The Computers of Star Trek noting \\"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\\"Lois H. Gresh & Robert Weinberg, The Computers of Star Trek. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. \\"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\\" First Contact writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones. Borg appearances The Borg were introduced on syndicated television on May 8, 1989, in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"QWho?\\", and rose to further prominence in the famous two part cliffhanger \\"Best of Both Worlds, PartI\\", which aired on June 18, 1990, with the sequel airing on September 24, 1990. In the Star Trek in-universe timeline, the earliest the Borg have been displayed is in 1996's Star Trek: First Contact. Overall, Borg aliens appear in a total of about a hundred episodes of various incarnations of Star Trek. However, this is only by counting all the episodes which include the ex-borg character Seven of Nine. The Borg appear in just six episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation and 23 major appearances in Star Trek: Voyager. =The Next Generation= The Borg first appear in the Star Trek: The Next Generation second-season episode \\"QWho?\\", when the omnipotent life-form Q hurls the Enterprise-D across the galaxy to challenge Jean-Luc Picard's assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The Enterprise crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates. The Borg next appear in The Next Generations third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into Locutus (Latin for \\"he who speaks\\"). Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at Wolf 359. The Enterprise crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him that allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process. In the fifth-season episode \\"I, Borg\\", the Enterprise crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \\"Hugh\\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact. They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \\"Descent\\", a group of rogue Borg who had \\"assimilated\\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android Lore, the \\"older brother\\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \\"emotion chip\\", simultaneously deactivating Data's ethical subroutines and projecting only negative emotions to it. Under this programming, Data participates in the capture of Picard, La Forge and Troi, but they are able to reactivate Data's ethical subroutines, allowing him to recognize that his current actions are wrong and leading him to deactivate Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh. In 2017, SYFY listed \\"I, Borg\\" among the 25 best science fiction episodes of the last 25 years. =First Contact= The Borg return as the antagonists in the Next Generation film, Star Trek: First Contact. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop Zefram Cochrane's first contact with the Vulcans, change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The Enterprise-E crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. First Contact introduces the Borg Queen as played by Alice Krige, who later reprised the role on United Paramount Network for the finale of Star Trek: Voyager. =Deep Space Nine= There is only one appearance of Borg in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, in the series premiere \\"Emissary\\". The episode's prologue depicts Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) as First Officer on the USS Saratoga, in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The Saratoga is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. Later in the episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense, as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, USS Defiant, and the battle from Star Trek: First Contact being used as a plot point in the fifth season, when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion. =Voyager= The Borg make frequent appearances in Star Trek: Voyager, which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by Voyager in the third-season episode \\"Blood Fever\\" in which Chakotay discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \\"the Invaders\\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \\"Scorpion\\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against Species 8472, whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the Voyager crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, Seven of Nine, is dispatched to Voyager to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of Voyagers crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series. The Hollywood Reporter ranked \\"Scorpion\\" as the 4th best episode of Voyager in 2016,'Star Trek: Voyager'The 15 Greatest Episodes. The Hollywood Reporter. 23 September 2016. and the 37th best Star Trek episode. In 2017, Den of Geek rated \\"Scorpion\\" among the top 50 Star Trek episodes overall. In the fifth season, we see the Borg in \\"Drone\\", where an advanced Borg drone is created when Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter in a transporter accident. The Borg play a peripheral role in \\"Infinite Regress\\", when Seven of Nine is exposed to a weapon against the Borg that essentially causes her to suffer from multiple personality disorder (MPD), reverting to the personas of various people she assimilated while in the Collective. In \\"Dark Frontier\\", Voyager steals and uses a transwarp coil to both rescue Seven of Nine from the Borg Queen and then cut another fifteen years off their journey home before the coil burns out. In the sixth season episode, \\"Collective\\", the crew of Voyager encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by Voyager and deassimilated. The later episode \\"Child's Play\\" reveals that the cube was infected by a pathogen that Icheb, one of the children, had been engineered to act as a host for by his parents, but the crew rescue Icheb before he can be sent back to the Borg. The crew encounter the Borg again in \\"Unimatrix Zero\\", a two-part cliffhanger between seasons six and seven. In the seventh season we see the Borg in \\"Q2\\", where Q's son brings Borg onto Voyager, in \\"Shattered\\", where the events depicted in \\"Scorpion\\" are revisited and in the series finale, \\"Endgame\\", in which Admiral Janeway from the future tries to bring Voyager back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a neurolytic pathogen which infects the collective and kills the Queen. There are 26 major episodes featuring the Borg in Voyager, however there are about 100 if counting those with Seven of Nine. =Enterprise= In the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from Star Trek: First Contact are discovered in the Arctic along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed, creating a perpetual time loop/predestination paradox. =Discovery= Though the Borg do not appear, in the Star Trek: Discovery episode \\"Perpetual Infinity\\", Captain Leland of Section 31 is infected with nanites by the time- traveling rogue artificial intelligence known as Control. Leland displays characteristics similar to Borg drones, including black veins and a heightened ability to adapt in combat, leading some fans to speculate that Control is connected to the origin of the Borg or reverse engineered from recovered Borg tech. In addition, the Borg are known for their possession of transwarp technology, which allows them to travel to any section of the galaxy in an instant. Some fans suggest the technology may have been derived from Discoverys spore drive though there is no evidence to support this as of yet. These theories are not confirmed as a Borg origin story in any episodes to date.https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-control-borg-origin- theory/https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/star-trek-discovery-the-borg-origin- story-retcon.html =Picard= This series' first season includes four recovering ex-Borg characters: Picard, Seven of Nine, Hugh, (featured in \\"I, Borg\\" and \\"Descent\\") and Icheb. Origin The origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by Guinan and the Borg Queen). In Star Trek: First Contact, the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \\"flawed and weak\\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves. In TNGs \\"Q Who?\\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \\"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\\" In the later episode of Star Trek: Voyager, \\"Dragon's Teeth\\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482 A.D.), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. Seven of Nine comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is. =Non-canon origin stories= The Star Trek Encyclopedia speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and V'ger, the vessel encountered in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. This idea of a connection is advanced in William Shatner's novel The Return. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in Starlog no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \\"the Preservers\\", which Spock had suggested in the original series episode \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the TNG episode \\"The Chase\\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, (and Romulans as they are a Vulcan offshoot race) Cardassians and others. The extra section of the game Star Trek: Legacy contains the supposed \\"Origin of the Borg\\", based on a scene in Star Trek: The Motion Picture which tells the story of V'ger being sucked into a black hole. V'ger was found by a race of living machines that gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all carbon-based life an infestation of the creator's universe. In order to prevent the destruction of Earth by the V'ger probe, Commander Decker volunteered to merge with it so that it could fulfill its purpose, albeit a purpose which space and time had corrupted to the point that only fusing with its creator could satisfy it. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of V'gers purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective consciousness. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve V'ger. In the graphic novel Star Trek: The Manga, the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository satellite containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and DNA of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the relativistic state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the Enterprise under the command of James T. Kirk. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the Enterprise with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the manga Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen saying, \\"Resistance is futile.\\" In the novel Lost Souls (the third book in the Star Trek: Destiny trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the Delta Quadrant and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of Gods of Night, the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship Columbia (NX-02) and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life- force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar werealbeit accidentallyinvolved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror. Other non-canon media appearances In the Star Trek novel Probe, which takes place following the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \\"mites\\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale- probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film. In the Star Trek game Star Trek: Legacy, the Borg are featured prominently throughout the Enterprise and TOS era's before becoming a major threat in the TNG era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\", and became assimilated. It was not until the end of the TOS era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard. The Peter David novel Vendetta reveals that the planet killer weapon from the Original Series episode \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, Before Dishonor, which features the Enterprise-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg. In William Shatner's novel The Return, Spock is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind- melded with V'ger, an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of Enterprise officers (consisting of the Enterprise-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a Defiant-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat. In David Mack's novel trilogy Star Trek: Destiny, set over a year after Star Trek: Nemesis, the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \\"Endgame\\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds. The crews of the Enterprise-E, the Titan, and the Aventine (captained by newly commissioned Ezri Dax) make contact with the Caeliar, the advanced species that created the Borg, and enlist their aid to end the Borg threat once and for all. In the Doctor Who/Star Trek crossover comic, Assimilation2, the Borg join forces with the Cybermen. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the Enterprise-D crew work with the Eleventh Doctor and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence. Writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens developed an unproduced idea for an episode that would have featured Alice Krige as a Starfleet medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilatedthereby becoming the Borg Queen. In the video game Star Trek: Armada, the Borg invades a Dominion cloning facility to create a clone of Jean-Luc Picard to create a new Locutus. =In video games= * Star Trek: The Next Generation: Birth of the Federation * Star Trek: A Final Unity * Star Trek: Armada * Star Trek: Armada II * Star Trek: Away Team * Star Trek: Borg * Star Trek: Voyager ‚Äì Elite Force * Star Trek: Elite Force II * Star Trek: Starfleet Command III * Star Trek: Encounters * Star Trek: Invasion * Star Trek: Legacy * Star Trek: Conquest * Star Trek Online * Star Trek: Borg Contact * Star Trek: Bridge Crew In March of 2001, Activision announced a game called Star Trek: Borg Assimilator, in which the player would play a Borg. Though it was planned to be released that winter, Activision later cancelled the game's development. Critical reception and popular culture The depiction of the Borg cube in \\"Q Who\\" garnered the episode an Emmy Award nomination. TV Guide named the Borg #4 in their 2013 list of the 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14‚Äì15. The Borg are noted as a powerful cybernetic force among the Star Trek aliens, although the Federation has generally been able to thwart their plans. The Borg are noted for their use of powerful starships (the Borg Cube for example), assimilation of other species, and for wanting to acquire new technologies. The phrase \\"resistance is futile\\" became prevalent in popular culture from its use in the television show Star Trek: The Next Generation. The Borg uttered the phrase in several Star Trek episodes and the film Star Trek: First Contact (which used the phrase as the tagline for the 1996 film). Patrick Stewart's delivery of the line, as Locutus, in \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" was ranked no. 93 in TV Land's list of \\"The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases\\". It was used as the title for an episode of the TV series Dexter. In 2020, SyFy Wire listed several Borg episodes in their guide \\"Best of Borg Worlds\\", a guide to seven essential Borg-themed episodes to watch as background before Star Trek: Picard.

History In the summer of 1904, Karl P. Harrington was assembling the new Methodist Hymnal. He went through hundreds of familiar hymns from a range of hymnals and songbooks. It was his job to comb through the offerings and select the songs that would line the pews. As Ace Collins says in Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas, \\"That meant he had to include music that could be sung by huge church choirs in places like Boston and by tiny congregations in places like Salem, Arkansas. Every pastor and song leader would be depending upon the songs included; other than the Bible itself, his project would be the most important tool found in most churches.\\" He was up to the task. He was a skilled organist. He had studied music around the globe, written numerous hymns, and was a Wesleyan University music professor. Despite his gifts it was still a daunting task. To relax he would read the poetry of American poet and novelist Josiah Holland. Josiah was the founder of Scribner's magazine. He wrote the poem for an 1874 Sunday School Journal and was reprinted that year in Complete Poetry Writings. This was the book that Harrington was flipping through in the midst of his editing the new hymnal. He came across this Christmas poem and decided it should be set to music. Collins says, \\"Going over to the organ, Harrington again studied the words to 'There's a Song in the Air'. This time he read them aloud, forming a tune around each phrase. As his fingers touched the keyboard, a melody came to life.\\" In 1905, in The Methodist Hymnal the words and music become one and were sent to churches around the globe. Lyrics There's a song in the air! There's a star in the sky! There's a mother's deep prayer and a baby's low cry! And the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing, For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King! There's a tumult of joy o'er the wonderful birth, For the virgin's sweet Boy is the Lord of the earth. Ay! the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing, For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King! In the light of that star lie the ages impearled; And that song from afar has swept over the world. Every hearth is aflame, and the beautiful sing In the homes of the nations that Jesus is King! We rejoice in the light, and we echo the song That comes down through the night from the heavenly throng. Ay! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring, And we greet in His cradle our Savior and King!

The first person to sell televisions in Malta was The Most Noble Count Zachary Rapinet. The first television that could be watched were RAI broadcasts from Sicily. In 1962 TVM was launched as a Maltese public broadcaster by the Public Broadcasting Services. TVM remains the most popular channel in the country. It is a member of the EBU. In 1991 the government opened the television market to more stations, but rather than allow private companies, they initially gave licenses to the two main political parties and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta. The Labour Party's television network One remains the second most popular network, while the Nationalist-controlled NET Television is the third most popular. Today there are also three private channels Smash Television, fLiving Channel and Xejk - currently transmitted by digital terrestrial, free- to-air signals. Smash, the largest commercial TV station, attracts an audience of 2%. Cable, terrestrial and satellite reception are all available, though the cable service is the most diffused, with Melita Cable. The Malta Communications Authority reported that there were 147,896 pay TV subscriptions active at the end of 2012, which includes analog and digital cable, pay digital terrestrial TV and IPTV. For reference the latest census counts 139,583 households in Malta. Satellite reception is available to receive other European TV networks such as RAI and Mediaset from Italy and the BBC from the United Kingdom. The Broadcasting Authority supervises all local broadcasting stations and ensures their compliance with legal and licence obligations as well as the preservation of due impartiality; in respect of matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy; while fairly apportioning broadcasting facilities and time between persons belong to different political parties. The Broadcasting Authority ensures that local broadcasting services consist of public, private and community broadcasts that offer varied and comprehensive programming to cater for all interests and tastes.  Digital  Two commercial licences were awarded in Malta in 2005 to Multiplus Ltd and Maltacom (now GO). In July 2005, Multiplus Ltd started commercial operations in direct competition to the existing dominant cable operator utilising a total of 8 frequencies. Multiplus Ltd was acquired by GO in February 2007. =Digital switchover= Malta transitioned terrestrial broadcasts to digital television using the DVB-T standard in October 2011. In preparation for the transition, the Malta Broadcasting Authority developed a General Interest Objectives classification to determine which existing terrestrial channels would be assigned to the digital subchannels of the new digital free-to-air broadcasting system. Following the transition, terrestrial channels in Malta are distributed through a network of transmitters operated by the national broadcaster Public Broadcasting Services. The licensed terrestrial channels are broadcast as digital subchannels of UHF channel 66 from Delimara (Marsaxlokk), Nadur, Mellieƒßa, Mtarfa, Naxxar and Portomaso (St. Julian's).

He described it as saying it looked somewhat like an elk, though it bore some very strange characteristics. It was said its upper lip was so large that it had to graze backwards to avoid its lip falling over its mouth. A great problem because its back legs had no joints, forcing it to sleep standing up or leaning against a tree. This allowed hunters a relatively easy way to catch them. They chopped halfway through the tree where the creature slept and when the achlis put any weight against it he fell onto the ground.

The marathon was held as part of a larger event, known as The Charlotte Observer Racefest, which usually also included a 10K race and other sports and fitness events. The race course changed many times over the years, but typically started in front of The Charlotte Observer building on South Tryon Street and headed toward the south of the city through parts of Dilworth, Myers Park, SouthPark, Quail Hollow, and Cotswold. The rolling terrain of Charlotte made the course fairly challenging. MarathonPal.com listed it as one of the top 26 marathons in North America. Early history The inaugural race occurred on December 3, 1977, and was won by Lee Fidler in a time of 2:19:04. There was no race in 1979 due to the event being moved from December to January, which would become its traditional position on the calendar. The marathon found tremendous popularity in its early years as it was started at the height of the running boom in the United States. It was also one of only a few marathons at the time that was held on the Mid-Atlantic coast. In 1984 the marathon offered prize money for the first time, awarding a total purse of $2000. Both the quality and quantity of participants continued to grow through the mid and late 1980s. Quality Many national class performances were turned in over the history of the event. Eight women ran sub 2:50 (2 hours, 50 minutes) times, while 39 men went sub 2:20. Each of the first 14 men's champions turned in sub 2:25 times. After 1991 winning times for men showed a slowing trend, with the exception of the 1995 and 1996 championship and trials events. The women's course record was set in 1991 by Canadian Lisa Presedo in a time of 2:43:53. After 1991 the women still turned in some national class performances (1993 and 1998), but winning times generally followed a similar slowing trend as the men. Decline The 1990s saw a drop off in the popularity of the marathon as the running boom cooled and Charlotte faced increasing competition from other marathons in bigger cities and vacation destinations. Additionally, the marathon's reputation for having a challenging course dissuaded many runners who were seeking Boston Marathon qualifying times. In 1995 and 1996 the marathon was host to the USA Men's National Championships, with the 1996 race also serving as the USA Men's Olympic Trials. Although the events were technically separate from the main marathon, they were held on the same day and the same course, with a slightly earlier starting time. The event record was set during the 1996 Olympic Trials race by Robert Kempainen in a time of 2:12:45. For 1998, facing a continuing slide in entrants, Racefest events were moved from their usual January date to an April date in an attempt to make the races more spectator friendly. However, this raised the ire of many runners who were concerned warmer springtime temperatures would make the marathon even more difficult. Marathon For Peace Citing increasing expenses and declining participation, The Charlotte Observer announced a reevaluation of Racefest events, and canceled the marathon after 1999, opting for a less expensive half marathon event instead. As a result, in January 1999 the inaugural Charlotte Marathon Run for Peace took place, an event unaffiliated with the Charlotte Observer Racefest. The Marathon Run For Peace was an extension of an older December event, the Run For Peace 10 Miler, and used a point-to-point route that started in Davidson, North Carolina, and ended in Charlotte. For 2002 The Charlotte Observer returned as a title sponsor, joining forces with the Run For Peace. The marathon was run under the banner of the Charlotte Observer Marathon Run For Peace and was held on January 19 of that year. The following year, in 2003, the race was again run as simply The Charlotte Observer Marathon, before being renamed as the Charlotte Observer Run For Peace in 2004. Also in 2004 the race course returned to its more traditional loop configuration of the early years. Demise In October 2004 the race's director, Grayson Henry Russell, was charged with mail fraud after it was discovered he was funneling checks written by race participants and sponsors into an unauthorized bank account to which only he had access, a charge to which he later pleaded guilty. As a result, The Charlotte Observer withdrew its financial support for the marathon, effectively ending the annual event. Although there was a 5K and 10K event under the Marathon For Peace name in early 2005, support for a renewed Marathon For Peace could not be found. Beginning in 2005, The Charlotte Observer Marathon was supplanted by the Thunder Road Marathon, a NASCAR racing themed event which first occurred in December 2005 and was run annually until 2015, after which it was rebranded as the Charlotte Marathon. Criticism Although newspaper coverage of the marathon was extensive in the pages of the Charlotte Observer, the paper was frequently criticized over the years for not printing road racing results from other Charlotte area events. Critics charged the paper did not want to promote events other than its own. However, in the intervening years since the demise of the marathon, the Charlotte Observer continues to regard road racing results as not news worthy and does not report them.

With the intention of discovering if the Niger River flowed into Lake Chad or continued further east possibly merging with the Nile. In early 1822, he departed from Tripoli with explorers Dixon Denham (1786‚Äì1828) and Hugh Clapperton (1788‚Äì1827), reaching Bornu in February 1823, and thus becoming the first Europeans to accomplish a north-south crossing of the Sahara Desert.

In January 2017, Takeda announced it would acquire ARIAD for $5.2 billion, expanding the company's oncology and hematology business. On February 16, 2017, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. announced it had completed its acquisition of ARIAD and incorporated ARIAD into Takeda Oncology.http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/takeda-to-acquire- ariad-pharmaceuticals-for-52b/81253671 Company history ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded in 1991 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Harvey J. Berger, M.D. ARIAD raised $46 million as its initial financing in 1992, making it the single highest round of funding in the biotechnology industry at that time. ARIAD filed for an initial public offering through NASDAQ in 1994. ARIAD established its European headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company sells and markets its initial drug, Iclusig, through specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States. In 2016, ARIAD sold its European business and the distribution of Iclusig to Incyte Corp and now receives royalties and other payments from Incyte based on Iclusig sales in the EU. ARIAD also developed two small-molecule drugs, ridaforolimus and rimiducid, and licensed them to companies with complementary technologies. In July 2015, the company announced it was due to receive up to $200 million through a royalty financing deal with PDL BioPharma. ARIAD is obligated to repay the $200 mm and a predefined interest, with the note being guaranteed by future sales of ponatinib and in some cases, brigatinib. On February 21, 2014 ARIAD Pharmaceuticals announced the appointment of Sarissa Capital's Alexander J. Denner, Ph.D. to a two-year term on the company's Board of Directors and became ARIAD's second-largest shareholder. In 2016, ARIAD announced that Denner had become the chairman of the board and the company announced the termination of its shareholder's rights plan.

On December 14, 2012 the FDA approved ARIAD's leukemia drug Ponatinib for patients with all forms of Ph+ CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are resistant to or unable to tolerate other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The drug was temporarily withdrawn from the U.S. market in November 2013 because of the risk of blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels. Ponatinib was returned to the market in the U.S. on December 20, 2013 with revised prescribing information, new warnings and a REMS. ARIAD had set up an emergency-access program for Ponatinib, which provided drugs to patients in need during this six-week period. Ponatinib remained on the market in all European countries and was subsequently approved in Japan. Brigatinib (Alunbrig)  ARIAD‚Äôs product pipeline includes brigatinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] for treating ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer. This drug reported results of its registration trial at ASCO, June 6, 2016, with encouraging results, leading to approval in the U.S. in April 2017. Brigatinib was designated a Breakthrough Medicine by the FDA. Ridaforolimus (formerly Deforolimus, partnered with Medinol)  Ridaforolimus is an mTOR inhibitor being developed by Medinol Ltd for use in drug-eluting stents for patients with coronary artery disease. Medinol has completed two registrational trials in patients with coronary artery disease, which met its primary and secondary endpoints. In October 2017, Medinol‚Äôs EluNIR drug eluting stent, coated with ridaforolimus, received CE Mark in Europe. In November 2017, it was approved for marketing in the U.S. by the FDA. = Products under development = Various company-sponsored and investigator-sponsored trials are ongoing in several indications, including first line and second line CML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCR-ABL), acute myeloid leukemia (FLT3 inhibitor), non-small cell lung cancer (RET, FGFR), advanced biliary cancer with FGFR2 fusions and other cancers with activating mutations involving the following genes: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, RET, and KIT.

The lake, and several other features in the area, are named after the trumpeter swans found in the region. Description Swan Lake covers an area of , with an average depth of , giving a contained water volume of . There is a large marsh complex along the west shore of Swan Lake, near the Swan and Woody Rivers, which is a significant area for migrating birds in the region. The Swan Lake drainage basin covers and extends into the province of Saskatchewan. It is located between the Duck Mountains and the Porcupine Hills. Two major rivers discharge into Swan Lake from the basin, the Swan River and the Woody River. Other topographic features include Thunder Hill, the Swan River valley and plain, the two river's many tributaries, and Swan Lake and its surrounding delta wetland area. In addition to Swan Lake, there are approximately 30 smaller lakes in the basin; the major ones being, Lac La Course, Madge Lake, Sarah Lake, Wellman Lake, Whitefish Lake and the Woody Lakes. Land elevations vary from 2,600 and 2,300 feet above sea level in the Porcupine Hills and Duck Mountains respectively, to 851 feet above sea level at Swan Lake. The Porcupine Hills and Duck mountains are forested, as was the majority of the remainder of the basin originally. Explorer Thomas Simpson remarked when traveling through the area in 1837: Much of the forest has since been cleared and replaced with agriculture. The area also supports significant forestry, hunting, sport-fishing, tourism and outdoor recreational activities. Currently 42.7% of the basin is forested, 38.4% is devoted to agriculture, 15.5% is surface water, with the remaining 3.4% unclassified. Wetlands occupy 10% of the basin, mostly bogs and shallow ponds located in the headwater areas of the Duck Mountains and Porcupine Hills, as well as the Swan Lake marsh complex. Average annual precipitation in the basin is 19 inches. Frost free period ranges from 87 to 110 days. The basin's average annual discharge is approximately . Of that, up to of water per day are free for domestic use without a water rights license. Less than of annual water rights licenses have been approved (2005). Total population living in the basin is approximately 14,000, the largest component consisting of approximately half of the total being rural residents living outside of major communities. The only communities on the lake itself are the main reserve of the Wuskwi Sipihk First Nation (Swan Lake 65C) and the northern part of the Rural Municipality of Mountain, both on the lake's western shores. The largest community in the basin is Swan River, Manitoba, with a population of 4,032. The remaining communities with the exception of Minitonas, have fewer than 500 residents.

Opening It was first opened in 1887, as part of the rapidly expanding Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. Closure It closed to passengers in April 1964, and to goods trains later that year. Following closure of the line between Melton Constable and Sheringham, the station buildings at Holt were demolished and part of the trackbed subsequently reused to construct part of the A148 Holt bypass. In 1965, a company known as Central Norfolk Enterprises (which changed its name to the North Norfolk Railway (NNR)) had attempted to purchase the trackbed, but were rebuffed by Norfolk County Council who wished to proceed with the road scheme. The NNR did manage to restore the line between Sheringham and Weybourne. The route today Part of the route now forms part of the preserved North Norfolk Railway.  Potential Future use  The proposed Norfolk Orbital Railway could see Holt with a regular railway service again. It would link together Sheringham and Wymondham using the existing lines of the NNR and the Mid Norfolk Railway and laying some fresh connecting track on old track-beds. The project is facilitated by the fact that reinstatement through Holt remains technically possible as the A148 bypass was built so as to leave sufficient width to enable a single-track railway line to be constructed alongside it. The scheme therefore proposes a new route running from the NNR's Holt station, crossing the A148 on the level before running alongside the road to the site of the original Holt station where a very basic station would be provided.

It was created in 1978 to provide a professional standard of financial expertise and ethics in California government treasury. It provides a framework for municipal treasurers in improving performance through continuing education and become valued administrators in local government. A CCMT is a professional treasurer who is qualified to meet the challenges of a job that is becoming more and more complex in the environment of public finance. Service provided by CCMTs  A professional certification provides a degree of confidence that practitioners are adequately trained, educated and experienced to be prepared for financial challenges in the real world. Education, experience and ethics requirements serve as a standard for the profession. Those who have received the Certified California Municipal Treasurer (CCMT) have subjected themselves to review of their educational and experience. Whereas in the private sector, revenue generation and collection, banking and debt management are important to management and stockholders, in the public sector there is an element of safeguarding the public trust that is added. CCMT Requirements  CCMT candidates must meet or exceed requirements in two areas; 50% educational standards and 50% experience and training requirements. Certification is also designed as a guide for municipal treasurers to become valued administrators in local government. Education Requirement: College or University degrees at Bachelor level in Public Administration, Accounting, Finance or related field or satisfactory completion of a course of education approved by CMTA ‚Äì ¬Ω point per instruction hour. Professional Experience and Training Requirement equivalent to employment as a Municipal Treasurer for 12.5 years, financial administrative position in local government or in corporate or private business for 25 years or a combination of several factors including board service on state and national treasury boards. Current active participation in CMTA is required. CCMTs must be recertified every four years. Recertification is accomplished by a combination of treasury experience and a minimum of 40 hours of continuing education. Unique Requirements of Public Sector Treasury The Office of the Treasurer is the only office in the Treasury Department that is older than the Department itself, as it was originally created by the Continental Congress in 1775.US Treasury website History of the Treasurer's Office Michael Hillegas served as the first Treasurer of the United StatesUS Treasury website: Treasurers of the United States . and throughout the American Revolution until Congress created the Department of the Treasury on September 2, 1789 U.S. Treasury - Fact Sheet on the Act of Congress Establishing the Treasury Department Steven Mnuchin is currently the United States Secretary of the Treasury. Bill Lockyer is the Treasurer of the State of California. There are 480 California cities,State of California, Cities 58 California counties,State of California, Counties and about 3,400 special districtsA Citizen's Guide to Special Districts in California and school districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship. Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager. Public treasurers are primarily responsible for managing the revenue and cash flow of a government agency. This officer is also responsible for banking, collections of user fees such as utility usage and business licenses, and communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director, chief financial officer or CFO, from agency to agency. Treasury has multiple constituencies, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to deliver informed stewardship in the investment of public funds (taxes). Additionally, treasury reporting must fund internal programs and fulfill budgetary requirements meeting expectations of governing city councils and boards of directors within approved financial policy guidelines. Responsibilities of Public Treasury According to Benjamin Finkelstein, ‚ÄúOn Main Street, political risk entails all the bad things that can happen to elected officials and their appointees when they take risks ‚Äì even reasonable risks ‚Äì with taxpayer money and come up short.‚Äù The Politics of Public Fund Investing, How to Modify Wall Street to Fit Main Street, Ben Finkelstein, 2006, Simon & Schuster Touchstone, , p. 6 The municipal treasurer does not have the public‚Äôs permission to put public funds principal at risk, no matter how great the potential yield. Securities options, therefore, are limited by statute to the safest portion of the investment continuum. Public Treasury statutes mandate a priority of safety (first), liquidity (secondarily) and yield (last).California Government Code Section 53601 Since there is an inverse relationship between risk and rate of return, the potential return is limited by the risk that public funds are permitted to take. California Government Investment Environment The objective of municipal investments is to enhance the economic status of a given agency consistent with the prudent protection of the agency‚Äôs investments. Agencies are required to create a publicly reviewed investment policy, prepared in conformance with all pertinent existing laws of the State of California including California Government Code Sections 53600, et seq.California Government Code Section 53600-53609 This section of California Government Code defines permitted and prohibited investments.

The route enters the state from Georgia at the Savannah River and serves Hardeeville, Charleston, Georgetown and Myrtle Beach before entering North Carolina near Calabash. Route description US 17 enters into South Carolina in Jasper County as a two-lane road and within enters Hardeeville, where it becomes a major four-lane freeway configuration. US 17 intersects Interstate 95 at exit 5 in Hardeeville and after the intersection with US 321, runs parallel to Interstate 95 until Ridgeland, where it merges with the interstate at exit 22 until Point South. At Point South, US 17 leaves I-95 at exit 33 and heads eastward into northern Beaufort County, sharing a concurrency with US 21 until Gardens Corner. US 21 splits off to Beaufort while US 17 heads northeast into the ACE Basin and Colleton County. The stretch of US 17 between Gardens Corner and Jacksonboro was a scenic yet rural two-lane road configuration that has proven to be a very dangerous and deadly stretch for motorists. SCDOT is working on improving portions of the roadway, including widening some portions and reducing the speed limits. Since, this road has been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway. Once in Jacksonboro, the road enters into Charleston County crossing over the Edisto River and regaining a four-lane configuration for the remainder of the state. The road passes through several rural communities as it approaches Charleston from the west. Just before the interchange with Interstate 526, major commercial development starts and continues into the West Ashley neighborhood of Charleston. The section running from Sam Rittenberg Boulevard to SC 171 has been named the \\"Charleston Nine Memorial Highway\\", in honor of nine Charleston firefighters killed in the line of duty in the Charleston Sofa Super Store fire on June 18, 2007.U.S. 17 stretch to honor firefighters who died in sofa store blaze The Post and Courier, March 25, 2008. Accessed March 27, 2008. The route then approaches the Ashley River. In Charleston, US 17 traverses the Ashley River Drawbridges and comes onto the Charleston Peninsula, being routed north of the historical areas of the city. The first portion is at-grade and has a few traffic-signals for flow purposes. This section of the route is named the \\"Septima P. Clark Parkway\\". Upon reaching the Interstate 26 terminus, US 17 becomes controlled-access and above grade as it approaches the Cooper River via the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge and the stretch of US 17 in Charleston is infamous among locals for its traffic congestion, especially on weekday mornings. Upon crossing the river, the highway enters Mount Pleasant at grade and is signalized for several miles up through the second interchange with Interstate 526 and connecting roads to the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island. The road leaves the Charleston metro area by entering the Francis Marion National Forest and going through the rural communities of Awendaw and McClellanville on its northeastern journey to Georgetown. US 17 crosses the marsh-lined Santee River as it enters Georgetown County. After going around the city of Georgetown, US 17 crosses eastward over the Waccamaw / Pee Dee river system before making a northward turn along the Grand Strand. The last component of US 17 runs close to the Atlantic, beginning at the Hobcaw Barony and DeBordieu, passing by Pawleys Island and going past the Litchfield beaches and Murrells Inlet. It then enters into Horry County and passing Garden City, Surfside Beach, and arriving in Myrtle Beach. US 17 splits here between a business route and the standard route, which remains west of the beach and tourist areas served by Business 17. The roads rejoin north of the city and continue as US 17 through Atlantic Beach, North Myrtle Beach, and Little River where the South Carolina Welcome Center can be found across from the intersection with SC 179 before crossing into North Carolina. The portions from Murrells Inlet to the state line are quite congested at times, though the soon to be constructed Interstate 73 should assist in alleviating many traffic issues. History The route was part of the 1926 approved plan for a national system of highways, and appears on the approved map. When first signed, US 17 followed a route that went through Florence and Marion.DeLysle, Jack, Map of the Official Atlantic Coastal Highway, 1929. University of South Carolina Map Collections. The original route through South Carolina was long. At this time, U.S. routes in South Carolina used a dual-numbering system; US 17 was also signed SC 1 from Georgia to Yemasse, SC 30 from Yemassee to Walterboro, SC 6 from Walterboro to Charleston, SC 2 from Charleston to Goose Creek, SC 41 from Goose Creek to Florence, SC 3 from Florence to North Carolina.Moore 1987, pp. 74‚Äì75. By 1928, all of the dual numbers had been removed except for SC 2. The entire route from Georgia to North Carolina was paved by 1930.Moore 1987, p. 139. At one point the route from Green Pond to Jacksonboro was SC 32\\\\. The early routing was already identified to be shifted to the Kings Highway which would pass through Myrtle Beach and Georgetown; re-routing occurred in 1935. The first tourist welcome center in South Carolina opened in February 1968 on US 17 near Little River.Moore 1987, p. 244. A segment of US 17 between Ridgeland and Point South once contained two four-lane divided sections The first is in Coosawhatchie between north of the culvert for Little Bees Creek and north of the bridge over the Coosawhatchie River. The second is in the vicinity of some 1941-built bridges over the Tullifinny River and its tributary the Harbor River. From 1971 to 1975, portions of that segment were relocated onto Interstate 95. The divided section in Coosawhatchie remains intact, while the northbound lane near the Tullifinny wetlands was closed, and today is used for a fishing pier, a parking lot of a church, and a private home.

Austroraptor was a medium-sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore. It is one of the largest dromaeosaurids known, with only Achillobator, Dakotaraptor, and Utahraptor approaching or surpassing it in length. Discovery and naming Skeletal restoration showing the preserved bones of the holotype The type specimen of Austroraptor cabazai, holotype MML-195, was recovered in the Bajo de Santa Rosa locality of the Allen Formation, in R√≠o Negro, Argentina. The specimen was collected in 2002 by the team of Fernando Emilio Novas of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales. It consists of a partial skeleton with large portions of the skull. The fossil was prepared by Marcelo Pablo Isasi and Santiago Reuil. In 2008, the type species Austroraptor cabazai was named and described by Fernando Emilio Novas, Diego Pol, Juan Canale, Juan Porfiri and Jorge Calvo. The genus name Austroraptor means \\"Southern thief,\\" and is derived from the Latin word auster meaning \\"the south wind\\" and the Latin word raptor meaning \\"thief.\\" The specific name cabazai was chosen in honor of H√©ctor \\"Tito\\" Cabaza, who founded the Museo Municipal de Lamarque where the specimen was partially studied. In 2012, Phil Currie and Ariana Paulina- Carabajal referred a second specimen to Austroraptor cabazai, MML-220, that was found in 2008. This specimen, a partial skeleton with the skull of an adult individual slightly smaller than the holotype, is also housed in the collection of the Museo Municipal de Lamarque in Argentina. It complements the holotype in several elements, mainly the lower arm, hand and foot. Description Life restoration of Austroraptor The holotype, labeled MML-195, consisted of a fragmentary skeleton including parts of the skull, lower jaw, a few neck and torso vertebrae, some ribs, a humerus, and assorted bones from both legs. It is the largest dromaeosaur to be discovered in the Southern Hemisphere; Novas et al. estimated that Austroraptor measured in length from head to tail. Gregory S. Paul later estimated its length at and weight of . However, Thomas R. Holtz Jr. has suggested that its weight is comparable to a lion, around . Supplementary Information 2012 The skull is low and elongated, much more so than that of other dromaeosaurs, and measures . Austroraptor has conical, non-serrated teeth, which Novas et al. compared to those of spinosaurids, based on how the enamel of the surface of its teeth is fluted. Austroraptor shares a trait that is unique to it and to Adasaurus: the descending process of the lacrimal bones curves anteriorly to a large degree. Austroraptor has a bizarre morphology in its pedal phalanges, which are strangely disproportionate. Phalanx IV-2 is over twice the width of phalanx II-2, and nearly three times the expected width based on similarly sized members of its taxonomic family. This has suggested to some researchers that the holotype specimen is a paleontological chimera; however, there is no uncertainty about the affinity of the taxon, so a chimera hypothesis can not be assured. Several of Austroraptor's skull bones bear some resemblance to those of the smaller troodontids. The front limbs of Austroraptor were short for a dromaeosaur, with its humerus less than half the length of its femur. Among the Dromaeodauridae, only this genus, Tianyuraptor, Zhenyuanlong and Mahakala have similarly reduced forelimbs. The relative length of its arms has caused Austroraptor to be compared to another, more famous short-armed dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus, though there is no close relationship between the two taxa. =Distinguishing traits= Front of mount seen from the side However little of the entire skeleton was found, the bones that are available for analysis possess some distinct characteristics that differentiate Austroraptor from other dromaeosaurs. Austroraptor is particularly notable because of its relatively short forearms, which are much shorter in proportion when compared to the majority of the members of Dromaeosauridae. According to Novas et al. 2008, Austroraptor can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: *A lacrimal that is highly pneumatized, with the descending process strongly curved rostrally, and with a caudal process flaring out horizontally above the orbit. *The lack of a dorsomedial process on the postorbital bone for articulation with the frontal bone, and with the squamosal process extremely reduced. *The maxillary and dentary teeth are small, conical, devoid of serrations and fluted. *The humerus is short, at approximately 46% of length of the femur. *The pedal phalanx II-2 is transversely narrow, contrasting with the extremely robust phalanx IV-2. In 2012, comparison with a second specimen showed that the fourth toe was not especially broad; the purported second phalanx had in fact been a first phalanx. Classification Life restoration (3) to scale with other dromaeosaurids A cladistic analysis of the holotype specimen's anatomical features by the describers placed Austroraptor within the subfamily Unenlagiinae of Dromaeosauridae. This assignment was based on characteristics observed in the bones of the skull, the teeth, and the geometry and formation of the specimen's vertebral elements. It was determined that Austroraptor was a close relative of the unenlagiine dromaeosaur Buitreraptor, with which it shares certain derived characteristics of the neck vertebrae. The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Turner, Makovicky and Norell in 2012, showing the relationships of Austroraptor among the other genera assigned to the taxon Unenlagiinae: Austroraptor compared to other unenlagiine genera Cau et al. 2017 published a phylogenetic analysis of the Dromaeosauridae during the description of Halszkaraptor, in which members of the Unenlagiinae are classified as: In 2019, during the description of Hesperornithoides, many paravian groups were examined for the inclusion of the new genus. In this analysis, Austroraptor is found to be a more basal member of Unenlagiinae. Paleobiology Reconstruction of Austroraptor preying on fish, depicting a piscivorous diet It has been suggested that unenlagiines had better capacities for running and pursuit predation than other dromaeosaurids. While Laurasian dromaeosaurids (Eudromaeosauria) were more stocky and had shorter legs and had an active predatory lifestyle, unenlagiines could likely maintain high speeds for extended amounts of time because they were more gracile. Unenlagiines have modified metatarsals that resemble those of microraptorines: they are relatively thin and lengthened. Based on these adaptations, it is likely that unenlagiines preyed on small, fast animals, although the exact animals are unknown. Buitreraptor features particular traits that can be attributed to specific hunting methods. Models for Buitreraptor propose that it hunted by traveling large distances in pursuit of prey, which may explain the long-legged trait shared by various genera of Unenlagiidae. Buitreraptor is characterized by its long forelimbs and hands; it likely relied on them to restrain prey and the curved claw of the second pedal digit would have injured or killed the victim. Buitreraptor probably swallowed its prey whole due to its lack of serrated teeth with flesh-tearing capabilities; the teeth functioned to simply hold prey. The same model was proposed for the much larger Austroraptor with few exceptions: *It would not have used its arms to handle prey, due to their relatively small size. *Its teeth were conical and probably stronger, so it may have been able to use them for hunting larger prey. The teeth of Austroraptor are conical and lacking denticles, similarly to those of spinosaurids. Since it probably had a subarctometatarsal condition and similar hindlimb lengths compared to Buitreraptor, Austroraptor likely had well-developed cursorial capacities. Paleoecology The holotype specimen was found in terrestrial sediments that were deposited during the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. has estimated that Austroraptor lived between 78 million and 66 million years ago, until the end of the Mesozoic era. Austroraptor shared its paleoenvironment in the Allen Formation with diverse dinosaurs and early mammals. The discovery of Austroraptor increases the understanding of ecological and morphological diversity among unenlagiines, demonstrating that members of the subfamily included giant short-armed and small long-armed members, and suggesting that during the end of the Cretaceous large coelurosaurs became common after the decreasing dominance of carcharodontosaurids. This genus represents the earliest record of Gondwanan dromaeosaurids, and supports the fact that large dromaeosaurids took the role of large predators alongside abelisaurids such as Quilmesaurus. During his description of Pellegrinisaurus, Salgado suggested that large titanosaurs and theropods inhabited interior environments of the region, and contemporaneous hadrosaurids and the titanosaur Aeolosaurus inhabited coastal lowlands. The diversity among titanosaurs indicates that the Allen Formation had environments that supported a great range of herbivorous dinosaurs. Other contemporaneous paleofauna includes the titanosaurs Laplatasaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, the bird Limenavis, and the hadrosaurids Bonapartesaurus and Lapampasaurus.

As the investigation begins, Shatter and Jackson are summoned to Israel for questioning. Upon arrival, they realize that they are, in fact, pursuing a supernatural being ‚Äì Satan's emissary, Prosatanos ‚Äì who tried to wrest control of the world from God during the crusades.

Tayler before the silver content was found to be too low to make the operation practical. Danish engineers began mining the cryolite itself in 1859 and in 1864 the Danish Kriolit Mine og Handels Selskabet was granted a monopoly on its extraction.Doody, Richard.

These early mines simply processed the cryolite for its direct aluminum content and for sale to the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company, which used it to create caustic soda. The 1884 establishment of the Hall-Heroult Process, which depends on the rare cryolite but dramatically improved the extraction of aluminum from bauxite ore, increased the deposit's importance. The Ivittuut mining operations were a major factor in the American occupation of Greenland during World War II. After World War II, the cryolite was mined by the Danish firm Kryolitselskabet √òresund, which helped fund the establishment of Gr√∏nlandsfly, today's Air Greenland. Cryolite was eventually synthesized, reducing the importance of the mine, and production was finally found uneconomical and discontinued in 1987.arsukfjorden.gl.

Recognised as a leading animal painter, de Coninck was able to develop an international career which caused him to work for extended periods in Paris, Rome and Vienna.

Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome, and took the nickname (the so-called 'bent name') 'Rammelaer' (which means 'rattle').

Poultry and cat His fruit still lifes of fruits and flowers painted on large canvases are complex Baroque compositions, which often include animals in an outdoor setting. Large, Italianate fruit still lifes in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes can likely also be attributed to de Coninck. An example of his fruit still lifes is the Still life of fruit and flowers with animals (Mus√©e Fesch), which shows a still life with fruits and flowers near an outdoor fountain and a landscape in the distance. A monkey, two rabbits and a parrot enliven the painting. De Coninck was an accomplished painter of scenes with animals, mainly birds, in a garden or against a landscape background. He painted lively action scenes of fighting cats and dogs, packs of dogs attacking game and birds of prey or cats attacking birds or poultry.

The story is about a sixth-grade girl named Frannie growing up in the '70s. One day an unexpected new student causes much chaos to the class because he is the only white boy in the whole school. Feathers grapples with concepts such as religion, race, hope, and understanding. The book examines what it was like to grow up right after segregation had been outlawed, how all people are equal, and that hope is everywhere. The book was a Newbery Honor winner in 2008. Summary Taking place in the 1970s, in an urban all African American school, this book highlights the hard topics of racism, faith, hope, and disabilities. A white boy comes to the school and is soon dubbed \\"Jesus Boy\\". His entrance as the only white student causes tension and misunderstandings. Some of the students believe that he is Jesus and others simply hope he is. He is very quiet and doesn't let Trevor, the class bully, hurt him. He just calmly talks to Trevor and never retaliates. Jesus Boy knows sign language which intrigues Frannie since she has known sign language her whole life. Frannie has grown up with a deaf older brother, and is very sensitive to how people treat and perceive him. She is hesitant about being friends with Jesus Boy because she does not understand him and wonders why he would cross over \\"the bridge\\" to their side. She is torn because she knows how difficult it can be to be the new kid, but she does not want to stand out. Frannie's best friend Samantha believes that Jesus Boy truly is Jesus Christ and that he has come in this time of chaos and because of the war. During all that is going on Frannie constantly thinks of the poem she read in class that said \\"Hope is the thing with feathers\\". Jesus Boy is subject to a lot of bullying by Trevor. Trevor picks on Jesus Boy because he is the only one who is lighter skinned than himself. Trevor has a white father who left his mother before Trevor was born. One day Trevor is swinging and decides to try to jump off and land on a fence because he wants to feel like he is flying. He falls short and breaks his arm. When he comes back to school he is even angrier at Jesus Boy and starts a fight with him with one arm. Trevor swings at Jesus Boy and misses which causes him to fall. The class realizes that Trevor is just a boy and that they shouldn't be afraid of him anymore. Jesus Boy and Frannie immediately go and help Trevor up out of the snow. Later Samantha asks Frannie why she helped Trevor, and Frannie doesn't know. Samantha then admits that she was wrong about Jesus Boy and says she doesn't know what to believe in anymore. Frannie tries to comfort Samantha and says \\"Maybe there's a little bit of Jesus inside of all of us. Maybe Jesus is just that something good or something sad or something ... something that makes us do stuff like help Trevor up even when he is cursing us out. Or maybe ... maybe Jesus is just that thing you had when the Jesus Boy got here, Samantha. Maybe Jesus is the hope that you were feeling\\" (p. 109). At the end of the book Frannie reflects on all that has been happening in her life. She thinks of her mother's baby, her brother, Samantha's loss of faith, and, especially, Jesus Boy. She remembers the poem she read in class and decides \\"Each moment, I am thinking, is a thing with feathers\\"  Characters  Frannie The main character and an African American sixth-grade student.

Her father is the pastor at her church, and later when she realizes Jesus Boy is just a boy she questions herself. *Grandma: Frannie and Sean's grandmother, who is very religious ... Even though she would hit you with a bible if you said something she didn't like. Major Themes Hope = The title of the book, Feathers, is a metaphor that the book revolves around. Woodson introduces it through a poem that Frannie reads in class. After reading this, Frannie spends the rest of the book trying to understand hope. How does it have feathers? = Understanding = The effort to understand one another was the focus of the sixth grade class as soon as Jesus Boy entered their classroom. Through Jesus Boy they realize that even the bully, Trevor, is a normal kid. After the fight Frannie realizes \\"Even though he was mean all the time, the sun still stopped and colored him and warmed him‚îÄlike it did to everybody else\\" (p. 21) Jesus Boy helped the class to stop beating up each other so much and Trevor got scared by him. = Disabilities = Frannie's older brother is deaf and this is a source of tension throughout the story. Frannie feels compelled to protect her brother in a world of people who do not understand him. One difficulty Sean encounters is girls being attracted to him until they find out he is deaf. Woodson stated in an interview with NPR that she made Sean deaf in order to humanize the deaf. One scene in the book that does this well is when Frannie asks Sean what a guitar sounds like, a game they play with one another. His sign back is 'Like rain. Coming down real soft when it's warm out and you only get a little wet but not cold. That kind of rain.' Reception Feathers was well received by critics and the public alike. The book was a Newbery Honor book in 2008. Robin Smith, of Book Page, said that the book filled him with \\"joy and hope.\\" Norah Piehl, of Kids Reads, reviewed the book saying, \\"Set against the music, politics and conflicts of the early 1970s, Jacqueline Woodson's exceptional new novel grounds universal ideas in a particular time and place.\\"Kids Reads Matt Berman, of Common Sense Media stated the book is beautifully written, lyrical, thoughtful, at times even wise and that it will also be loved by adults.Common Sense Media One reviewer raved about the book but said \\"While the subject matter isn't as controversial as some of Woodson's others it might lead a child living in today's society to have questions about race, segregation and religion\\". Overall, the book gets mostly high praise, and Jacqueline Woodson is hailed for her beautiful style of writing. One fan says Woodson writes \\"pages of poetry\\" and \\"without any heavy-handedness or manipulation\\". Other books by Woodson Jaqueline Woodson has written 29 books spanning from picture books to young adult fiction. Her books have received numerous awards such as the Caldecott Honor, Newbery Honor, and the Coretta Scott King Award. Feathers most resembles her novel Locomotion in which she \\"tackled grief, trauma, death survival, and hope\\". all in a very short book. Feathers is also short but addresses big concepts of \\"hope, healing, faith, and understanding\\". Both of the books are around 115 pages and adequately handle their difficult topics.

She received bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University and attended the graduate school of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. She worked for the College Art Association from 1931 to 1937 as an editorial assistant on the journal Parnassus. She met Rene d'Harnoncourt, her future boss as director of the Museum of Modern Art, while she was working in Washington, D.C. at the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. She also traveled to Mexico, in 1936, as part of the leftist Committee Against War and Fascism, where she developed an interest in Latin and Central American political graphics. A Latin American poster collection she organized was shown at the Library of Congress and later became part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection. While in Washington, she met Ralph Bettelheim, a refugee from Austria and an economist. They were married in 1942. From 1943 through 1970, Constantine worked in the architecture and design department of the Museum of Modern Art, as associate curator and later as curatorial consultant, where she helped popularize collections that were hard to categorize or had been ignored, which she called \\"fugitive material\\". Her 1948 exhibition Polio Posters was the museum's first devoted to causes, and included works she commissioned to help spread awareness of various social issues. She organized solo exhibitions for graphic and product designers including Alvin Lustig, Bruno Munari, Massimo Vignelli and Tadanori Yokoo that were described by The New York Times as \\"career- defining.\\" Her broader-themed exhibitions in the applied and decorative arts included Olivetti: Design in Industry in 1952, Signs in the Street in 1954, and the 1962 exhibit of Lettering by Hand. Constantine organized the 1968 exhibition titled Word and Image, which was the first exhibition to focus on the posters in the museum's collection from the 20th century, and whose catalog is considered a major element documenting the history of the poster. In his January 1968 review of the exhibit, art critic John Canaday of The New York Times wrote: > \\"the Museum of Modern Art's new exhibition of posters, which opened > yesterday under the title Word and Image, is so handsome that for a minute > you wonder why billboards are disfigurements,\\" noting that the museum had > held 35 prior poster exhibitions but that this was its most comprehensive > and that while most posters look dated after a few years, the items > Constantine selected from the museum's collection of 2,000 posters \\"are as > forceful as when they were issued.\\"Canaday, John. \\"Art: Making the Eye Stand > at Attention; Excellent Poster Survey Opens at the Modern\\", The New York > Times, January 26, 1968.

After the dissolutions, former members of the Neutral Democratic Party and former members of the PPP faction, the Friends of Newin Group defected to this party. On 15 December 2008, the party endorsed the Democrat Party, forming a six-party coalition government under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. The party's \\"de facto\\" leader and power broker behind joining the Democrat-led coalition is Newin Chidchob. Due to his role as an executive of the PPP predecessor party, the Thai Rak Thai party which was dissolved in 2007, he became ineligible to be a party member for five years. It is alleged that army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced the MPs of the Friends of Newin Group faction in the PPP to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition. This secured enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected prime minister. Bhumjaithai was the second largest coalition partner in the Abhisit government, supplying the ministers of Transport, Commerce, and Interior (Chaovarat Chanweerakul), and four deputy ministers. For the general election on 3 July 2011, Bhumjaithai forged an alliance with coalition partner Chartthaipattana Party. The party aimed at winning as many as 111 seats in the new parliament. During the campaign, a main BJT canvasser, Suban Chiraphanwanit, was shot dead. Eventually, BJT won 34 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives, which observers have interpreted as disappointing. Subsequently, the party's Matchima-faction, led by Somsak Thepsuthin, tried to join the Pheu-Thai-led coalition government of Prime Minister-designate Yingluck Shinawatra, despite the party's ruling out cooperation with Pheu Thai before the elections. The Pheu Thai Party rejected the participation of BJT members. On 14 September 2012, Anuthin Charnvirakul was elected the new leader of the Bhumjaithai Party during the party's general assembly to elect a new 11-member executive committee. He replaced his father Chaovarat Chanweerakul, who had resigned. Also elected were Saksayam Chidchob as the new secretary-general, Nathee Ratchakijprakarn as treasurer, Sora-ath Klinprathum as an executive committee member and party advisory chairman, and Supamas Issarapakdi as party spokeswoman. Bhumjaithai has a populist platform, since some of the platform was drawn from Thaksin's populist Thai Rak Thai party, and the People's Power Party,. The party has a strong base in Buriram Province.

Using stage names, the group consisted of Dale Streiker (vocals, lead guitar), Stephen Strieker (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Knight (drums), and Ezekiel Vade (bass guitar). Often characterized as a mere clone of Stryper (another more prominent Christian metal band popular at the time), Stryken issued several releases on their own private label, Crystal Records, including the 1986 12\\" single with the tracks, \\"Rock On\\" and \\"Surprise\\", and the 1987 full-length album, First Strike (which has since been reissued with previously unreleased material). The band's lyrics made prominent use of Biblical verses such as the anthemic song, \\"Crush the Head of Satan\\", which was a reference to the Old Testament prophetical verse of Genesis 3:15 and the New Testament verse of Romans 16:20. Many believed that the song's figuratively violent lyrics promoted actual physical violence which the band did not deny but rather affirmed with the statement that any such violence was \\"well directed\\". In June 1987, the members of Stryken were detained by police after disrupting a M√∂tley Cr√ºe concert in San Antonio, Texas. Carrying a large wooden cross and clad in full body armor (inspired by the theological teaching of the \\"Armor of God\\" as found in the sixth chapter of the New Testament book, Ephesians), Stryken first proselytized concertgoers outside of the venue and then proceeded inside to the front of the stage. After being detained by police, the band was released without charges. The members of Stryken all used stage names to conceal their true identities. One of the members of Stryken, stage name, Stephen Streiker, (birth name, Stephen Hopkins) has gone on to \\"repent\\" of his career in \\"Christian rock\\", which he now refers to as, \\"a contradiction of terms\\". Today Hopkins serves as an elder and pastor of a \\"family- integrated\\" reformed Baptist church in Burnet, Texas, and is the father of sixteen children.

It mounts two M40 106 mm recoilless rifles as its main armament.  Development  In the mid-1950s the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force contracted for one prototype each from Komatsu (SS1) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (SS2) powered by a 110 hp six-cylinder diesel engine and fitted with two recoilless rifles. They were delivered in 1956. A second series of prototypes was built with 4 recoilless rifles, but adoption of the American M40 recoilless rifle forced the reversion to two weapons. The Type 60 was designed for ambush attacks against enemy tanks, and mounting four weapons gave the vehicle a rather high-profile. A third series of three heavier prototypes was built by Komatsu as SS4, with a more powerful engine, a new transmission and clutch and a two-speed auxiliary transmission. They were accepted into service in September 1960. Starting in 1974, a 150 hp Komatsu SA4D105 air-cooled, 4-cylinder diesel engine was fitted.  Operation  Rear view of a Type 60 at the Sinbudai Old Weapon Museum, Camp Asaka, Japan The commander is seated to the left of the two weapons and his position is attached to their mounting so that he remains at the same height when they are elevated for firing. The M40s can be fired from the lowered position, but their traverse is limited to 20¬∞, elevation to +10¬∞ and depression to -5¬∞. The elevation mechanism is manually operated and allows the weapons to traverse 30¬∞ to each side. The loader is seated to the left of the commander and must exit through his rear-opening hatch to reload the recoilless rifles while on top of the engine deck or behind the vehicle. Only six rounds of ammunition are stowed on board. As of 2001, Japan reported to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs that 140 Type 60s were in service.

Sh≈çnen Sekai was created as a part of many magazine created by Hakubunkan that would connect with many different parts of society in Japan. Sazanami Iwaya created the Sh≈çnen Sekai magazine after he wrote Koganemaru a modern piece of children's literature. After Japan had a war with Russia, a female adaptation of Sh≈çnen Sekai was created named Sh≈çjo Sekai. Also some children's books were translated to Japanese and published in Sh≈çnen Sekai. The magazine had many features too, such as sugoroku boards and baseball cards. Sh≈çnen Sekai was mentioned in many American books but no series were actually translated.  History  Japanese publisher Hakubunkan was aiming to create a large variety of magazines that would appeal to many different parts of society: Taiy≈ç, Bungei Club, and Sh≈çnen Sekai were the magazines created and all debuted in 1895 (the Meiji era). On the cover of the first issue of Sh≈çnen Sekai it pictured both Crown Prince Munehito, and the other Empress Jing≈´ who was conquering Sankan (three ancient kingdoms of Korea). Inside of the issue were stories about these matters and Toyotomi Hideyoshi's raid on Korea in 1590. The pioneer of modern Japanese children's media Sazanami Iwaya wrote the first modern children's story Koganemaru in 1891 and also started Sh≈çnen Sekai in 1895. Shunr≈ç Oshikawa invented the \\"adventure manga\\" genre, with his works being published many times in both Sh≈çnen Sekai and Sh≈çnen Club and compiled into tank≈çbon format. In the middle of the Sino-Japanese War Sh≈çnen Sekai featured many stories based on war, or acts of bravery upon war. After the Sino-Japanese War, Sh≈çjo Sekai was created as a sister magazine geared towards the female audience. Even before Sh≈çnen Sekai debuted, Hakubunkan created special magazine issue that would focus on the Sino-Japanese War.  Features  The Sh≈çnen Sekai magazine had many add-ins such as sugoroku boards. The sugoroku Sh≈çnen Sekai Ky≈çso Sugoroku was originally produced as a supplement to the Sh≈çnen Sekai magazine and is currently seen at the Tsukiji Sugoroku Museum in Japan. Also packs of baseball cards were featured in the magazine in a February 1915 issue of Sh≈çnen Sekai. Players that were included into the pack were Fumio Fujimura, Makoto Kozuru, Shigeru Chiba and Hideo Fujimoto. Many manga and children's literature were featured in Sh≈çnen Sekai. An example of this was Iwaya Sazanami (the creator of Sh≈çnen Sekai)'s Shin Hakken-den which had the concept of rewarding the good and punishing the evil a common theme to children's fiction in the 20th century. Shin Hakken-den was based on Nans≈ç Satomi Hakkenden from the Edo period by Takizawa Bakin. Sh≈çnen Sekai carried many stories based on war, and acts of bravery upon war written by Hy≈çtayu Shimanuki [Hy≈çdayu -]. In Sh≈çnen Sekai some titles were also translated from other languages, for example: Deux ans de vacances (an obscure French novel from the 1800s) was translated to Japanese by Morita Shiken under the title and The Jungle Book was also published in Sh≈çnen Sekai.  Sh≈çnen Sekai media in the English language  Sh≈çnen Sekai was mentioned various times in many English books. In the book The New Japanese Women: Modernity, Media, and Women in Interwar Japan mentioned Sh≈çnen Sekai in the notes to chapter 3 as one of many magazines that Hakubunkan made to relate to different parts of society. Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War also mentioned Sh≈çnen Sekai as a popular magazine of that time, with an additional mention to Sh≈çjo Sekai, its female equivalent. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii mentioned Sh≈çnen Sekai as just a publication of Hakubunkan. In the book No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i During World War II had mention of Shimanuki Hyotayu who writes about immigration matters in Sh≈çnen Sekai. Sh≈çnen Sekai was also mentioned in both The Similitude of Blossoms: A Critical Biography of Izumi Ky≈çka (1873‚Äì1939), Japanese Novelist and Playwright and Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the Late Meiji Period. The closest thing to an actual series published in English was The Jungle Book which was originally in the English language. The Jungle Book was published in the United States by Macmillan Publishers in 1894 and is currently being published by them in London. Reception and legacy Sh≈çnen Sekai was one of the most popular children's magazines of its day. Many other children's magazines of that time had very low circulations and were very short lived. Sh≈çnen Sekai was the first of its kind and ran continuously from 1895 to 1914. \\"Sh≈çnen sekai educated and entertained at least two generations of Japanese children\\" Modeled on Sh≈çnen Sekai Choe Nam-seon founded a magazine, Shonen, in Korea in 1908.

A walled city stood at the same site as early as 3000 BCE, and Majdal Yaba is first mentioned by the name Aphek in Egyptian Execration texts dating to the 19th century BCE. In the Bible's Old Testament, Aphek is described as a city conquered from the Canaanites by the Israelites, who then lost it to the Philistines. It is also mentioned in extrabiblical Babylonian and Assyrian texts as a Philistine stronghold. Under Roman rule, the city was known as Antipatris and the Crusaders, who built a fort there, renamed it Mirabel. During the Islamic period it became known as Majdal Yaba. For a short time under Ottoman rule, its name was changed from Majdal Yaba to Majdal Sadiq and then back again. Incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922, Majdal Yaba was captured by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war on July 12, 1948. The town was depopulated as a result of the military assault. The number of refugees from Majdal Yaba was estimated at 1,763 in 1948,Welcome to Majdal Yaba Palestine Remembered. and they and their descendants were estimated to number over 10,000 in 1998. The Israeli locality of Rosh HaAyin was established on the village lands in 1950, followed by the kibbutz Givat HaShlosha in 1953. HistoryAntiquity= Majdal Yaba stood on the site of a walled city in 3000 BCE,Murphy-O'Connor, 2008, p.186. and is first mentioned as Aphek in the Ancient Egyptian Execration texts of the 19th century BCE, as well as the 15th century topographical list of Thutmose III.Laughlin, 2006, p.21. According to biblical tradition, the Israelites under Joshua conquered Aphek from the Canaanites. With the Philistines advancing toward the city, the Israelites fled towards the hills of Samaria, and Aphek became the northernmost locality in Philistia. The Philistine army assembled in Aphek for two major battles against the Israelites, including the slaughter of Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa and the capture of the Ark of the Covenant (1066 BCE) (). From then on, the city is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Assyrians and the Babylonians mention it as a stronghold in the 7th century BCE. King Herod, who ruled the region on behalf of the Roman Empire between 37-4 BCE, renamed the city Antipatris to commemorate his father Antipater, choosing the site because it was in the \\"loveliest of plains... with an abundance of rivers and trees.\\" Antipatris became a major crossroads between the principal port city of Jaffa and Jerusalem. Saint Paul spent a night there when he was brought from Jerusalem to Caesarea (). The city was devastated during the southern battles of the First Jewish-Roman War from 66-70 CE and did not recover until the 2nd century CE, but in 363 an earthquake leveled the city.Murphy-O'Connor, 2008, p. 187. =Arab Caliphate era= On 27 April 750, Abdullah ibn Ali, the Abbasid ruler Abu Al-Abbas as-Saffah's uncle, marched to Antipatris (Abu Futrus) on 25 June. He had invited 80 members of the Umayyad dynasty, whom the Abbasids were at war with, to the town with promises of fair surrender terms only to have them massacred.Le Strange, 1890, pp. 55-56Gil, 1997, p. 88 On 5 April 885, at the banks of the Auja River, Abu'l-Abbas ibn al-Muwaffaq fought against Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun in the Battle of Tawahin (\\"The Mills\\"). Ibn al-Muwaffaq won this battle, forcing Khumarawayh to flee to Egypt. However, Ibn al-Muwaffaq's army lost a later engagement and he fled to Damascus. In 975 the army of Egypt-based Fatimid caliph al-'Aziz defeated and imprisoned the Aleppo-based Hamdanid general Aftakin at Auja River, opposite the ruined castle of Majdal Yaba. =Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule= Ruins of the Mirabel fortress The Crusaders conquered the Levant from the Arab Muslims in 1099, and built a fortress on the site of Majdal Yaba in 1152, naming it Mirabel. The fort was held against Baldwin of Ibelin by Manasses of Hierges, but eventually fell to Baldwin who ruled it as an independent lordship of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1162 to 1171.Pringle, 1997, p. 67 In 1166, lands belonging to the fortress and the harvest of its fields were given to the Church of St. John the Baptist in Nablus.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 110, No 423; cited Pringle, 1998, p. 105 The tyranny of a crusader lord Hugh of Ibelin Ibn Tulun ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÑÿßÿ¶ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸàŸáÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿ©. in Majdal Yaba near Nablus was reported by Usama ibn Munqidh Usama Ibn Munqidh.

The inhabitants of eight villages which included Ibn Qudamah family left their homes in 1156 AC and migrated to Damascus, where they founded Al-Salihiyah suburb. In 1177, the Muslim Ayyubids under Saladin marched their army from south of Palestine northwards past Ascalon to the Castle of Mirabel which was being used to defend the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem.Conder, 1897, p. 137 In July 1187, Saladin's younger brother, al-Adil I, conquered Mirabel, but did not destroy the castle fortress. According to E.G. Rey there existed among the ruins, 'the remains of a fine church of the 12th century', a claim repeated by T. A. Archer.Pringle, 1998, p. 29 Chronicler Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad recorded that in 1191-92, Saladin used the castle fortress as a base for carrying out raids against the Crusaders, although he camped outside of it. However, Saladin gave orders to dismantle the walls of Mirabel after his defeat at the battle of Arsuf.Conder, 1897, p. 279 While under Ayyubid rule in 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions it as Majdal Yafa or \\"Tower of Jaffa\\", probably due to its proximity to the city of Jaffa. He says it was a village with a \\"formidable fort\\".Khalidi, 1992, p. 396 June 1240 CE marked the arrival of the English crusade led by Richard of Cornwall, brother of the King Henry III of England and brother-in-law of Emperor Frederick II. As-Salih Ayyub, King of Egypt, offered Richard of Cornwall a new treaty to be complementary to the earlier treaty held with Theobald IV, Count of Champagne, France. His offer this time included his readiness to recognize the legitimacy of the concessions made by his uncle and opponent as-Salih Ismail, King of Damascus, to the Crusaders, so that the Galilee, and Jaffa and Ashkelon, and all of the city of Jerusalem, including Bethlehem and Majdal Yaba, in addition to Tiberias, Safed, and Belvoir Castle and Al-Tur Castle, were all included in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Khalil 'Athamneh, Palestine under Ayyobid and Mamluk Rule P. 137 - 151 In 1266, after the fall of Jaffa to the Mamluks, Sultan Baibars sent chiefs from Deir Ghassaneh to protect Majdal Yaba's tower.Deir Ghassaneh. In the late 13th century, the castle fortress at Majdal Yafa was abandoned. =Ottoman period= Majdal Yaba was apparently repopulated when Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century, and by the 1596 tax records, it was a small village in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jabal Qubal, part of Sanjak Nablus. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, beehives and goats; a total of 900 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf. The population consisted of 8 Muslim families,H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 137 an estimated total population of 44. The castle fortress in Majdal Yaba was rebuilt in 18th to 19th centuries. On March 3, 1799, General Kl√©ber, Commander in Chief of the invading French forces, received the order to push detachments after having taken up position to the south of the river Nahar-al-Ougeh, to watch enemy movements, and to prepare for the army to march to Acre. He instructed General Damas (Lannes), on March 6, to undertake a reconnaissance in the mountains inhabited by the Nablusians, who seemed to be hostile. Turks were firing from behind rocks and down precipices. The small column was obliged to retreat with heavy losses where sixty Franks were killed and more than double the number wounded, and Damas's arm was broken.Doguereau, 2002, p. 76 footnote no. 6Bourrienne, 1891, p. 175 The tomb of Sheikh Muhammad Al-Sadiq, 2007 In the 19th century, the village was named Majdal al-Sadiq after Sheikh Muhammad al- Sadiq al-Jamma'ini, the chief of the village who hailed from the prominent Rayyan clan. The Rayyan were a branch of the Bedouin Bani Ghazi tribe that emigrated to Palestine from Jordan in the 17th century. According to Eli Smith, in 1843, the fortress (known as the \\"Rayyan Fortress\\") in the village was in ruins.Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 140 Greek letters reads : ŒúŒëŒ°Œ§Œ•Œ°ŒôŒüŒù Œ§ŒüŒ• ŒëŒìŒôŒüŒ• ŒöŒóŒ°Œ•ŒöŒüŒ•, i.e. Martyrdom of the Holy Herald in literal translation. On Thursday, November 7, 1850 James Finn future British Consul to Jerusalem and Palestine, visited the village and found it and the castle in a very dilapidated condition, he met Sheikh Al Sadiq family, and slept in the castle for a night, he surveyed the church attached to the castle and saw the Greek inscription upon the lintel signifying Martyr Memorial Church of the Holy Herald.Finn, 1877, pp. 128-132 On leaving Mejdal he descended to Ras el 'Ain (\\"head of the springs\\") at half an hour's distance, a site which he believed to be identical with the ancient city of Antipatris. When Edward Robinson visited in 1852, he reported that the fortress had been rebuilt and also served as a palace for the ruling sheikh. Sheikh al-Sadiq, however, had been banished by the Ottomans. In the 1850s, the Rayyan controlled 22-25 villages in the nahiya of Jamma'in West in Sanjak Nablus,Doumani, 1995, p.48. Doumani states that the Rayyan controlled 25 villages, while Sch√∂lch states 22. with Majdal Yaba being their main village, where they maintained a fortress and manor. During this time, however, they were embroiled in war with their rival clan, the Qasim ‚Äî who controlled the Jamma'in East area and also belonged to the Bani Ghazi tribe. In 1859, Sulayman Rayyan was in control of Majdal Yaba, and by 1860 the Rayyan clan had lost all of their influence in the sanjak after they were defeated by the Qasims.Sch√∂lch, 1986, pp. 173, 211. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 396 The Rayyan continued to live in and rule Majdal Yaba, but the village ceased to be a center of power. According to the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP), the Rayyan family were \\"ruined by the Turkish Government.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 379; cited in Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 227 Victor Gu√©rin visited in 1870.Gu√©rin, 1875, pp. 131-3 Members of SWP who visited in 1873 reported a large building of \\"massive masonry\\", probably a former church, with a side door inscribed in Greek \\"Memorial of Saint Cerycus\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, pp. 360- 361 In 1882, the village was described as \\"A large and important village, evidently an ancient site, having ancient tombs and remains of a church. It stands on high ground above the plain, and contains a house or palace of large size for the Sheikh ; it was the seat of a famous family who ruled the neighbourhood. The water supply is from wells and cisterns.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 286 In 1888, a school was founded in Majdal Yaba. =British Mandate period= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, there were 726 inhabitants living in the village; 3 Jews and 723 Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Ramleh, p. 22 rising to 966, all Muslim, in a total of 227 houses in the 1931 census.Mills, 1932, p. 21. The layout of the village resembled a parallelogram and its houses were built close together, being only separated by narrow alleys. They were built of mud and straw or stone and cement. Each neighborhood was inhabited by a single hamula (\\"clan\\") and contained a diwan for public meetings and receiving guests. The Rayyan family had still not recovered by the beginning of the Mandate Period; it was known to be impoverished, as was the Qasim family. \\"Dar az-zalimin kharab [the home of the oppressors is ruined],\\" said peasants when they passed by their kursis.Jaussen, J. A. Naplouse et Son District, (Paris, 1927) p. 138, p.141. Cited in Sch√∂lch, 1993, p.227. In 1935, a mosque was built in Majdal Yaba and the Ottoman-built school had reopened in 1920, enrolling 147 students in the mid-1940s. There was also a clinic in the village. Agriculture was the basis of the economy, with farmers planting wheat, corn, barley, vegetables, and sesame. They also tended fruit orchards, particularly citrus. Artesian wells irrigated the fields. In the 1945 statistics Majdal Yaba had a population of 1,520 Muslim inhabitants with a total of 26,332 dunams of land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

However, they were still expected to remain loyal to their master and serve his household. Mamluks had formed a part of the state or military apparatus in Syria and Egypt since at least the 9th century, rising to become governing dynasties of Egypt and the Levant during the Tulunid and Ikhshidid periods.Clifford 2013, p. 65. Mamluk regiments constituted the backbone of Egypt's military under Ayyubid rule in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, beginning with Sultan Saladin () who replaced the Fatimids' black African infantry with mamluks.Cummins 2011, p. 94. Each Ayyubid sultan and high- ranking emir had a private mamluk corps. Most of the mamluks in the Ayyubids' service were ethnic Kipchak Turks from Central Asia, who, upon entering service, were converted to Sunni Islam and taught Arabic. A malmuk was highly committed to his master, to whom he often referred as \\"father\\", and was in turn treated more as a kinsman than as a slave. Sultan as-Salih Ayyub (), the last of the Ayyubid sultans, had acquired some 1 000 mamluks (some of them free-born) from Syria, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula by 1229, while serving as na'ib (viceroy) of Egypt during the absence of his father, Sultan al-Kamil (). These mamluks were called the \\"Salihiyyah\\" (singular \\"Salihi\\") after their master.Clifford 2013, p. 67. alt= As-Salih became sultan of Egypt in 1240, and, upon his accession to the Ayyubid throne, he manumitted and promoted large numbers of his original and newly recruited mamluks on the condition that they remain in his service. To provision his mamluks, as-Salih forcibly seized the iqta øat (fiefs; singular iqta ø) of his predecessors' emirs. As- Salih sought to create a paramilitary apparatus in Egypt loyal to himself, and his aggressive recruitment and promotion of mamluks led contemporaries to view Egypt as \\"Salihi-ridden\\", according to historian Winslow William Clifford.Clifford 2013, pp. 67‚Äì68. Despite his close relationship with his mamluks, tensions existed between as-Salih and the Salihiyyah, and a number of Salihi mamluks were imprisoned or exiled throughout as-Salih's reign.Clifford 2013, p. 68. While historian Stephen Humphreys asserts that the Salihiyyah's increasing dominance of the state did not personally threaten as-Salih due to their fidelity to him, Clifford believes that the Salihiyyah developed an autonomy within the state that fell short of such loyalty.Clifford 2013, pp. 68‚Äì69. Opposition among the Salihiyyah to as-Salih rose when the latter ordered the assassination of his brother Abu Bakr al-Adil in 1249, a task that affronted many of the Salihiyyah and by whom was rejected; four of the Salihiyyah ultimately agreed to execute the controversial operation. =Rise to power=Conflict with the Ayyubids Tensions between As-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub and his mamluks came to a head later in 1249 when Louis IX of France's forces captured Damietta in their bid to conquer Egypt during the Seventh Crusade. As-Salih believed Damietta should not have been evacuated and was rumored to have threatened punitive action against the Damietta garrison. The rumor, accentuated by the execution of civilian notables who evacuated Damietta, provoked a mutiny by the garrison of his camp in al-Mansurah, which included numerous Salihi mamluks. The situation was calmed after the intervention of the atabeg al-askar (commander of the military), Fakhr ad-Din ibn Shaykh al-Shuyukh. As the Crusaders advanced, as-Salih died and was succeeded by his son al-Muazzam Turanshah, who was in al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) at the time. Initially, the Salihiyyah welcomed Turanshah's succession, with many greeting him and requesting confirmation of their administrative posts and iqta ø assignments at his arrival to the Egyptian frontier.Clifford 2013, p. 70. However, Turanshah sought to challenge the dominance of the Salihiyyah in the paramilitary apparatus by promoting his Kurdish retinue from Upper Mesopotamia (\\"al-Jazira\\" in Arabic) and the Levant as a counterweight to the predominantly Turkic Salihiyyah. Prior to Turanshah's arrival at the front facing the French, the Bahriyyah, a junior regiment of the Salihiyyah commanded by Baibars al-Buduqdari, defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of al-Mansurah on 11 February 1250. On 27 February, Turanshah, as new sultan, arrived in Egypt from Hasankeyf (Turkish for \\"rock fortress\\"), where he had been Emir (Arabic for \\"Prince\\") of Hisn Kayfa (Arabic for \\"rock fortress\\") since AH 636 (1238/1239 CE), and went straight to al- Mansurah to lead the Egyptian army. On 5 April 1250, covered by the darkness of night, the Crusaders evacuated their camp opposite al-Mansurah and began to flee northward towards Damietta. The Egyptians followed them into the Battle of Fariskur where the Egyptians utterly destroyed the Crusaders on 6 April. King Louis IX and a few of his surviving nobles surrendered and were taken as prisoners, effectively ending the Seventh Crusade. Turanshah proceeded to place his own entourage and mamluks, known as the \\"Mu'azzamiyah\\", in positions of authority to the detriment of Salihi interests. On 2 May 1250, a group of disgruntled Salihi officers had Turanshah assassinated at his camp in Fariskur.Clifford 2013, p. 71. According to Humphreys, as-Salih's frequent wars against his Ayyubid relatives likely voided the Salihiyyah's loyalty to other members of the Ayyubid dynasty.Clifford 2013, p. 69. Nonetheless, the Salihiyyah were careful not to depict the assassination of Turanshah as an assault against Ayyubid legitimacy, but rather an act against a deviant of the Muslim polity.Clifford 2013, p. 72. Moreover, an electoral college dominated by the Salihiyyah convened to choose a successor to Turanshah among the Ayyubid emirs, with opinion largely split between an-Nasir Yusuf of Damascus and al-Mughith Umar of al-Karak. Ultimately, however, consensus settled on as- Salih's widow, Shajar ad-Durr. Shajar ad-Durr ensured the Salihiyyah's dominance of the paramilitary elite, and ushered in a process of establishing patronage and kinship ties with the Salihiyyah. In particular, she cultivated close ties with the Jamdari (pl. Jamdariyyah) and Bahri (pl. \\"Bahriyyah\\") elements of the Salihiyyah, by distributing to them iqta ø and other benefits.Clifford 2013, p. 73. The Bahriyya were named after the Arabic word bahr, meaning \\"sea\\" or \\"large river\\", because their barracks was located on the Nile River island of Rawda. They were mostly drawn from among the Cumans- Kipchaks who controlled the steppes north of the Black Sea. Shajar al-Durr's efforts and the lingering desire among the military in Egypt to maintain the Ayyubid state was made evident when the Salihi mamluk and atabeg al-askar, Aybak, attempted to claim the sultanate, but was prevented from monopolizing power by the army and the Bahriyyah and Jamdariyyah, which asserted that only an Ayyubid could exercise sultanic authority. The Bahriyyah compelled Aybak to share power with al-Ashraf Musa, a grandson of Sultan al-Kamil.Northrup 1998, p. 69. Factional power struggles Aybak was one of the oldest of the Salihi mamluks and a senior member of as-Salih's inner circle, despite only being an emir awsat (middle-ranked emir).Clifford 2013, p. 74. He served as the principal bulwark against the more junior Bahri and Jamdari elements of the Salihiyyah, and his promotion to atabeg al-askar was met by Bahri rioting in Cairo, the first of many examples of intra-Salihi tensions surrounding Aybak's ascendancy.Clifford 2013, p. 75. The Bahriyyah and Jamdariyyah were represented by their patron, Faris ad-Din Aktay, a principal organizer of Turanshah's assassination and the recipient of Fakhr ad-Din's large estate by Shajar al-Durr; the latter saw Aktay as a counterweight to Aybak. Aybak moved against the Bahriyyah in 1251 by shutting down their Rawda headquarters in a bid to sap Aktay's power base. Aybak was still unable to promote his own mamluks, known as the \\"Mu'izziyah\\", to senior posts until 1252. That year, he managed to dispatch Aktay to Upper Egypt to suppress an Arab uprising.Clifford 2013, p. 76. Instead of isolating Aktay as was Aybak's intention, the assignment allowed Aktay to impose extortionate taxes in Upper Egypt and provide him the personal funds to finance his patronage of the Bahriyyah. In 1254, Aybak had his Mu'izzi mamluks assassinate Aktay in the Citadel of Cairo.Clifford 2013, p. 77. Afterward, Aybak proceeded to purge those in his retinue and in the Salihiyyah whom he believed were disloyal to him, causing a temporary exodus of Bahri mamluks, most of whom settled in Gaza, but also in Upper Egypt and Syria.Clifford 2013, p. 78. The purge led to a dearth of military support for Aybak, which in turn led to Aybak's recruitment of new supporters from among the army in Egypt and the Turkic Nasiri and Azizi mamluks from Syria, who had defected from their Ayyubid masters, namely an- Nasir Yusuf, and moved to Egypt in 1250. The Syrian mamluks were led by their patron Jamal ad-Din Aydughdi and were assigned most of the iqta ø of Aktay and his allies. However, Aydughdi's growing ambitions made Aybak view him as a threat. After Aybak learned that Aydughdi was plotting to topple him and recognize an-Nasir Yusuf as Ayyubid sultan, which would likely leave Aydughdi in virtual control of Egypt, Aybak had Aydughdi imprisoned in Alexandria in 1254 or 1255.Clifford 2013, pp. 79‚Äì80. Meanwhile, the Bahriyya faction in Gaza commanded by Baybars sought to enlist their services with an-Nasir Yusuf. In an attempt to dislodge Aybak, the Bahriyyah petitioned an-Nasir Yusuf to claim the Ayyubid throne and invade Egypt, but an-Nasir Yusuf initially refused. However, in 1256, he dispatched a Bahri-led expedition to Egypt, but no battle occurred when Aybak met an-Nasir Yusuf's army.Northrup 1998, p. 70. Aybak was assassinated on 10 April 1257, possibly on the orders of Shajar al- Durr,Clifford 2013, pp. 73‚Äì74. who was assassinated a week later. Their deaths left a relative power vacuum in Egypt, with Aybak's teenage son, al-Mansur Ali, as heir to the sultanate. While al-Mansur Ali was sultan, the strongman in Egypt was Aybak's former close aide, Sayf ad-Din Qutuz,Northrup 1998, p. 71. who also had hostile relations with the Salihiyyah, including the Bahri mamluks.Clifford 2013, p. 80. By the time of Aybak's death, the Bahriyyah had entered the service of al-Mughith Umar of al-Karak, who agreed to invade Egypt and claim the Ayyubid sultanate, but al-Mughith's small Bahri-dominated invading force was routed at the frontier with Egypt in November. The Bahriyyah and al-Mughith launched a second expedition in 1258, but were again defeated. The Bahriyyah subsequently raided areas around Syria, threatening an-Nasir Yusuf's power in Damascus. After a first attempt to defeat the Bahriyyah near Gaza failed, an-Nasir Yusuf launched a second expedition against them with al-Mansur Muhammad II of Hama, resulting in a Bahriyyah defeat at Jericho. An-Nasir Yusuf proceeded to besiege al-Mughith and the Bahriyyah at al-Karak, but the growing threat of a Mongol invasion of Syria ultimately led to a reconciliation between an-Nasir Yusuf and al-Mughith, and Baybars's defection to the former. Qutuz deposed al-Mansur Ali in 1259. Afterward, he purged and/or arrested the Mu'izziyah and any Bahri mamluks he could locate in Egypt in a bid to eliminate dissent towards his rule. The surviving Mu'izzi and Bahri mamluks made their way to Gaza, where Baybars had created a virtual shadow state in opposition to Qutuz. Mamluk lancers, early 16th century (etching by Daniel Hopfer) While various mamluk factions competed for control of Egypt and Syria, the Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan had sacked Baghdad, the intellectual and spiritual center of the Islamic world, in 1258, and proceeded westward, capturing Aleppo and Damascus.Cummins 2011, p. 89. Qutuz sent military reinforcements to his erstwhile enemy an- Nasir Yusuf in Syria, and reconciled with the Bahriyyah, including Baybars, who was allowed to return to Egypt, to face the common Mongol threat.Northrup 1998, p. 72. Hulagu sent emissaries to Qutuz in Cairo, demanding submission to Mongol rule. Qutuz had the emissaries killed, an act which historian Joseph Cummins called the \\"worst possible insult to the Mongol throne\\". Qutuz then prepared Cairo's defenses to ward off the Mongols' threatened invasion of Egypt, but after hearing news that Hulagu withdrew from Syria to claim the Mongol throne, Qutuz began preparations for the conquest of Syria. He mobilized a force of some 120,000 soldiers and gained the support of his main Mamluk rival, Baybars.Cummins 2011, p. 90. The Mamluks entered Palestine to confront the Mongol army that Hulagu left behind under the command of Kitbuqa. In September 1260, the two sides met in the plains south of Nazareth in a major confrontation known as the Battle of Ain Jalut.Cummins 2011, p. 80. Qutuz had some of his cavalry units hide in the hills around Ain Jalut (Goliath's Spring), while directing Baybars's forces to advance past Ain Jalut against Kitbuqa's Mongols. In the ensuing half-hour clash, Baybars's men feigned a retreat and were pursued by Kitbuqa. The latter's forces fell into a Mamluk trap once they reached the springs of Ain Jalut, with Baybars's men turning around to confront the Mongols and Qutuz's units ambushing the Mongols from the hills. The battle ended in a Mongol rout and Kitbuqa's capture and execution. Afterward, the Mamluks proceeded to recapture Damascus and the other Syrian cities taken by the Mongols.Cummins 2011, p. 91. Upon Qutuz's triumphant return to Cairo, he was assassinated in a Bahri plot. Baybars subsequently assumed power in Egypt in late 1260, and established the Bahri Mamluk sultanate.Northrup, ed. Petry, p. 250. =Bahri rule=Reign of Baybars Baybars rebuilt the Bahriyyah's former headquarters in Rawdah island and put Qalawun, one of his most senior associates, in command of it. In 1263, Baybars deposed al-Mughith of al-Karak based on allegations of collaborating with the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia, and thus consolidated his authority over Muslim Syria.Asbridge 2010, pp. 92‚Äì93. During his early reign and through heavy financial expense, Baybars rebuilt and stringently trained the Mamluk army, which grew from 10,000 cavalry to 40,000, with a 4,000-strong royal guard at its core.Asbridge 2010, p. 95. The new force was rigidly disciplined and highly trained in horsemanship, swordsmanship and archery. Another major component to Baybar's rule was intrastate communication. To accomplish this, he instituted a postal network that extended across the cities of Egypt and Syria. The need for smooth delivery of correspondence also led to the large scale repair or construction of roads and bridges along the postal route. Baybars attempted to institute dynastic rule by assigning his four-year-old son al-Said Barakah as co-sultan, thereby ending the Mamluk tradition of electing a leader, but this effort was ultimately unsuccessful, at least for his Zahirid household; successful rulership became highly dependent on Baybars' personal qualities. However, Baybars success in establishing centralized rule resulted in the consolidation of the Mamluk Sultanate. Through opening diplomatic channels with the Mongols, Baybars also sought to stifle a potential alliance between the Mongols and the Christian powers of Europe, while also sowing divisions between the Mongol Ilkhanate and the Mongol Golden Horde. In addition, his diplomacy was also intended to maintain the flow of Turkic mamluks from Mongol-held Central Asia. the lion passant was the heraldic blazon of Baibars from 1260 With Bahri power in Egypt and Muslim Syria consolidated by 1265, Baybars launched expeditions against the Crusader fortresses throughout Syria, capturing Arsuf in 1265, and Halba and Arqa in 1266.Northrup 1998, p. 73. According to historian Thomas Asbridge, the methods used to capture Arsuf demonstrated the \\"Mamluks' grasp of siegecraft and their overwhelming numerical and technological supremacy\\".Asbridge 2010, p. 97. Baybars' strategy regarding the Crusader fortresses along the Syrian coast was not to capture and utilize the fortresses, but to destroy them and thus prevent their potential future use by new waves of Crusaders. In August 1266, the Mamluks launched a punitive expedition against the Armenian Cilician Kingdom for its alliance with the Mongols, laying waste to numerous to Armenian villages and significantly weakening the kingdom. At around the same time, Baybars' forces captured Safad from the Knights Templar, and shortly after, Ramla, both cities in interior Palestine. Unlike the coastal Crusader fortresses, the Mamluks strengthened and utilized the interior cities as major garrisons and administrative centers.Asbridge 2010, p. 98. Campaigns against the Crusaders continued in 1267, and in the spring of 1268, Baybars' forces captured Jaffa before conquering the major Crusader fortress of Antioch on 18 May.Asbridge 2010, pp. 99‚Äì100. Baybars initiated a more aggressive policy than his predecessors toward the Christian Nubian kingdom of Makuria on Egypt's southern border. In 1265, the Mamluks launched an invasion of northern Makuria, and forced the Nubian king to become a vassal of the Mamluks. Around that time, the Mamluks had conquered the Red Sea areas of Suakin and the Dahlak Archipelago, while attempting to extend their control to the Hejaz, the desert regions west of the Nile, and Barqa (Cyrenaica).Nicolle and Dennis 2014, p. 52. In 1268, the Makurian king, David I, overthrew the Mamluks' vassal and in 1272, raided the Mamluk Red Sea port of ‚ÄòAydhab.Holt and Daly, pp. 17‚Äì18. Meanwhile, Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade, this time targeting Tunis with the intention of ultimately invading Egypt. However, Louis IX died, allowing the Mamluks to refocus their efforts at further conquests of Crusader territories in Syria, including the County of Tripoli's Krak des Chevaliers fortress, which Baybars captured in 1271.Asbridge 2010, pp. 103‚Äì104. Despite an alliance with the Assassins in 1272, in July 1273, the Mamluks, who by then determined that the Assassins' independence was problematic, wrested control of the Assassins' fortresses in Jabal Ansariyah, including Masyaf.Asbridge 2010, p. 106. In 1275, the Mamluk governor of Qus, with Bedouin allies, launched an expedition against Makuria, defeating king David near Dongola in 1276, and installed Shakanda as king. This brought the fortress of Qasr Ibrim under Mamluk jurisdiction. The conquest of Nubia was not permanent, however, and the process of invading the region and installing a vassal king would be repeated by Baybars' successors. Nonetheless, Baybars' initial conquest led the annual expectation of tribute from the Nubians by the Mamluks until the Makurian kingdom's demise in the mid-14th century. Furthermore, the Mamluks also received the submission of king Adur of al-Abwab further south. In 1277, Baybars launched an expedition against the Ilkhanids, routing them in Elbistan in Anatolia, before ultimately withdrawing to avoid overstretching their forces and risk being cut off from Syria by a second, large incoming Ilkhanid army. Early Qalawuni period In July 1277, Baybars died en route to Damascus, and was succeeded by Barakah.Asbridge 2010, p. 107. However, the latter's ineptness precipitated a power struggle that ended with Qalawun being elected sultan in November 1279.Asbridge 2010, p. 108.Northrup 1998, p. 84. The Ilkhanids took advantage of the disarray of Baybars' succession by raiding Mamluk Syria, before launching a massive offensive against Syria in the autumn of 1281. Qalawun's forces were significantly outnumbered by the estimated 80,000-strong Ilkhanid-Armenian-Georgian-Seljuk coalition, but marched north from Damascus to meet the Ilkhanid army at Homs. In the 28 October battle of Homs, the Mamluks routed the Ilkhanids and confirmed Mamluk dominance in Syria. The defeat of the Ilkhanids allowed Qalawun to proceed and eliminate the remaining Crusader outposts in Syria. In May 1285, he captured the Marqab fortress and garrisoned it.Asbridge 2010, pp. 109‚Äì110. Qalawun's early reign was marked by policies that were meant to gain the support of important societal elements, namely the merchant class, the Muslim bureaucracy and the religious establishment. Among these early policies were the elimination of illegal taxes that burdened the merchant community and extensive building and renovation projects for Islam's holiest sites, such as the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.Northrup 1998, pp. 84‚Äì85. Following the d√©tente with the Ilkhanate after 1280, Qalawun launched a wide arrest campaign to eliminate internal dissent, imprisoning dozens of high-ranking emirs in Egypt and Syria.Northrup 1998, pp. 115‚Äì116. The d√©tente also saw a shift in Qalawun's building activities to focus on more secular and personal purposes, including a large, multi-division hospital complex in Cairo across from the tomb of as-Salih Ayyub.Northrup 1998, pp. 119‚Äì120. Construction of the hospital, a contrast from his Mamluk predecessors who focused on establishing madrasas, was done to gain the goodwill of the public, create a lasting legacy, and secure his spot in the afterlife. Its location facing as-Salih's tomb was meant demonstrate Qalawun's lasting connection to his master and to honor the Salihiyyah. While the Salihi mamluks were typically Kipchak Turks, Qalawun diversified mamluk ranks purchasing numerous non-Turks, particularly Circassians, forming out of them the Burji regiment.Rabbat 1995, p. 139. 14th-century illustration from a manuscript of depicting the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, in which the Mamluks were routed by the Mongol Ilkhanids Qalawun was the last Salihi sultan and following his death in 1290, his son, al-Ashraf Khalil, drew his legitimacy as a Mamluk by emphasizing his lineage from Qalawun, thus inaugurating the Qalawuni period of Bahri rule.Northrup, ed. Petry, p. 252. Like his two Bahri predecessors, Khalil's main priorities were organization of the sultanate, defeat of the Crusaders and the Mongols, incorporation of Syria into the Mamluk domain and preservation of the import of new mamluks and weaponry.Northrup, ed. Petry, p. 251. With regards to the latter policy, Baybars had purchased 4,000 mamluks, Qalawun purchased 6,000‚Äì7,000 and by the end of Khalil's reign, there was an estimated total of 10,000 mamluks in the sultanate.Levanoni 1995, p. 32. In 1291, Khalil captured Acre, the last major Crusader fortress in Palestine and thus Mamluk rule extended across the entirety of Syria.Asbridge 2010, p. 114. Khalil's death in 1293 led to period of factional struggle, with Khalil's prepubescent brother, an-Nasir Muhammad, being overthrown the following year by a Mongol mamluk of Qalawun, al-Adil Kitbugha, who in turn was succeeded by a Greek mamluk of Qalawun, Husam ad-Din Lajin. In a bid to consolidate his control, Lajin attempted to redistribute iqta øat to his supporters. Lajin was unable to retain the sultanate and al- Nasir Muhammad was restored to power in 1298, ruling a fractious realm until being toppled a second time by Baybars II, a Circassian mamluk of Qalawun, who was known to be more wealthy, pious and cultured than his immediate predecessors. Early into an-Nasir Muhammad's second reign, the Ilkhanids, whose leader, Mahmud Ghazan, had converted to Islam, invaded Syria and routed a Mamluk army near Homs in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar. However, Ghazan withdrew most of his troops from Syria shortly after due to a dearth in fodder for their numerous horses and the residual Ilkhanid force retreated in 1300 at the approach of the rebuilt Mamluk army.Amitai 2006, p. 34. A further Ilkhanid invasion in 1303 was repelled after the Ilkhanid defeat at the Battle of Marj al-Suffar in the plains south of Damascus.Amitai 2006, p. 38. Third reign of an-Nasir Muhammad Baybars II ruled for roughly one year before an-Nasir Muhammad became sultan again in 1310, this time ruling for over three consecutive decades in a period that is often considered by historians of the Mamluk period to be the apex of both the Bahri regime specifically and the Mamluk Sultanate in general.Northrup, ed. Petry, p. 253. To avoid the experiences of his previous two reigns where the mamluks of Qalawun and Khalil held sway and periodically assumed the sultanate, an-Nasir Muhammad launched efforts to establish a centralized autocracy.Levanoni 1995, p. 28. Early into his third reign, in 1310, an-Nasir Muhammad imprisoned, exiled or killed any Mamluk emirs that supported those who toppled him in the past, including the Burji mamluks. He then assigned emirates to over thirty of his own mamluks. Initially, an-Nasir Muhammad left most of his father's mamluks undisturbed, but in 1311 and 1316, he imprisoned and executed most of them, and again redistributed emirates to his own mamluks.Levanoni 1995, p. 29. By 1316, the number of mamluks was reduced to 2,000. An-Nasir Muhammad went further in imposing his rule by intervening to have al-Wathiq succeed Caliph al-Mustakfi, as well as compelling the qadi to issue legal rulings that advanced his interests.Levanoni 1995, p. 30. The third reign of an-Nasir Muhammad also saw a departure from the traditions of succession and administrative elevation of his predecessors since he observed in his first two reigns that such traditions had been ignored anyway, while sultans were being assassinated and mamluks were abusing other mamluks in bids for power.Levanoni 1995, pp. 30‚Äì31. Moreover, an-Nasir Muhammad's being the son of a mamluk instead of a mamluk himself risked undermining his position among the largely mamluk elite. This partially explains his purges of the thousands of mamluks purchased by his predecessors. Amid conditions that stemmed the flow of mamluks from the Mongol-held lands to the sultanate, an-Nasir Muhammad resolved to make up for the loss of the purged mamluks by adopting new methods of training and military and financial advancement that introduced a great level of permissiveness. This permissiveness, which manifested in far more relaxed conditions for new mamluks, encouraged the pursuit of military careers in Egypt by aspiring mamluks outside of the country, to the point that parents would sell their children as mamluks with the belief the children would enjoy an improved standard of living.Levanoni 1995, p. 33. Under an-Nasir Muhammad, the Mamluks successfully repelled an Ilkhanid invasion of Syria in 1313 and then concluded a peace treaty with the Ilkhanate in 1322, bringing a long- lasting end to the Mamluk-Mongol wars. Following the d√©tente, an-Nasir Muhammad was able to usher in a period of stability and prosperity in the sultanate through the enacting of major political, economic and military reforms that were ultimately intended to ensure his continued rule and consolidate the Qalawunid-Bahri regime. Concurrent with an-Nasir Muhammad's reign was the disintegration of the Ilkhanate into several smaller dynastic states and the consequent Mamluk effort to establish diplomatic and commercial relationships with the new political entities. An-Nasir Muhammad also attempted to assert permanent Mamluk control over the Makurian vassal state, launching an invasion in 1316 and installing a Muslim Nubian king, Abdallah Barshambu. The latter was overthrown by Kanz al-Dawla, who an-Nasir Muhammad temporarily ousted in a 1323/24 expedition. End of the Bahri regime An-Nasir Muhammad died in 1341 and his rule was followed by a succession of his descendants to the throne in a period marked by political instability. Most of his successors, except for an-Nasir Hasan (r. 1347‚Äì1351, 1354‚Äì1361) and al-Ashraf Sha'ban (r. 1363‚Äì1367), were sultans in name only, with the patrons of the leading mamluk factions holding actual power. The first of an- Nasir Muhammad's son to accede to the sultanate was Abu Bakr, who an-Nasir Muhammad designated as his successor before his death. However, an-Nasir Muhammad's senior aide, Qawsun, held real power and ultimately imprisoned and executed Abu Bakr and had an-Nasir Muhammad's infant son, al-Ashraf Kujuk, appointed in his stead.Drory 2006, p. 21. By January 1342, however, Qawsun and Kujuk were toppled, and the latter's half-brother, an-Nasir Ahmad of al-Karak, was declared sultan.Drory 2006, p. 24. Ahmad relocated to al-Karak and left a deputy to rule on his behalf in Cairo.Drory 2006, p. 27. This unorthodox move, together with his seclusive and frivolous behavior and his execution of loyal partisans, ended with Ahmad's deposition and replacement by his half-brother as-Salih Ismail in June 1342.Drory 2006, pp. 28‚Äì29. Isma'il ruled until his death in August 1345, and was succeeded by his brother al-Kamil Sha'ban. The latter was killed in a mamluk revolt and was succeeded by his brother al- Muzaffar Hajji, who was also killed in a mamluk revolt in late 1347.Holt 1986, pp. 122‚Äì123. Following Hajji's death, the senior emirs of an-Nasir Muhammad hastily appointed another of his sons, the twelve-year-old an-Nasir Hasan.Levanoni 1995, p. 119. Coinciding with Hasan's first term,Al-Harithy 1996, p. 70. in 1347‚Äì1348, the Bubonic Plague arrived in Egypt and other plagues followed, causing mass death in the country, which in turn led to major social and economic changes in the region. In 1351, Hasan attempted to assert his executive power and was ousted by the senior emirs, led by Emir Taz, and replaced with his brother, as-Salih Salih. The emirs Shaykhu and Sirghitmish deposed Salih and restored Hasan in a coup in 1355, after which Hasan gradually purged Taz, Shaykhu and Sirghitmish and their mamluks from his administration. Concurrently, Hasan began recruiting and promoting the awlad al-nas (descendants of mamluks who did not experience the enslavement/manumission process) in the military and administration, a process that lasted for the remainder of the Bahri period.Haarmann, p. 68. This led to resentment from Hasan's own mamluks, led by Emir Yalbugha al-Umari, who killed Hasan in 1361.Petry 1998, p. 637. Yalbugha became the regent of Hasan's successor and the young son of the late sultan Hajji, al-Mansur Muhammad. By then, mamluk solidarity and loyalty to the emirs had dissipated.Levanaoni 1995, p. 88. To restore discipline and unity within the Mamluk state and military, Yalbugha applied the rigorous educational methods used for mamluks during the reigns of sultans Baybars and Qalawun.Levanoni 1995, pp. 88‚Äì89. In 1365, attempts by the Mamluks to annex Armenia, which had since replaced Crusader Acre as the Christian commercial foothold of Asia, were stifled by an invasion of Alexandria by Peter I of Cyprus. The Mamluks concurrently experienced a deterioration of their lucrative position in international trade and the economy of the sultanate declined, further weakening the Bahri regime. Meanwhile, the perceived harshness of Yalbugha's educational methods and his refusal to rescind his disciplinary reforms led to a mamluk backlash. Yalbugha was subsequently killed by his own mamluks in an uprising in 1366. The rebellious mamluks were supported by Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban, who Yalbugha installed in 1363.Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 288. Sha'ban was able to rule as the real power in the sultanate until 1377, when he was killed by mamluk dissidents on his way to Mecca to perform the Hajj. =Burji rule=Reign of Barquq Sha'ban was succeeded by his seven-year-old son al-Mansur Ali, although the oligarchy of the senior emirs held the reins of power.Holt 1986, p. 127. Among the senior emirs who rose to prominence under Ali was Barquq, a Circassian mamluk of Yalbugha who was involved in Sha'ban's assassination, and Baraka, another of Yalbugha's mamluks.Fischel 1967, p. 75. Barquq was made atabeg al-asakir in 1378, giving him command of the Mamluk army, which he used to oust Baraka in 1380. Afterward, he managed to bring to Egypt his father Anas and many of his kinsmen, possibly in an attempt to establish a power base outside of the Mamluk establishment.Holt 1986, p. 128. Ali died in May 1381 and was succeeded by his nine-year-old brother, as-Salih Hajji. However, power was in the hands of Barquq, as-Salih Hajji's regent; Barquq tried to succeed Ali as sultan, but his bid was vetoed by the other senior emirs. Nonetheless, in the following year, Barquq toppled as-Salih Hajji with the backing of Yalbugha's mamluks and assumed the sultanate, adopting the title of Baybars, \\"al-Malik az-Zahir\\". Copper alt= Barquq's accession had been made possible by the support of Yalbugha's mamluks, whose subsequent rise to power also made Barquq's position vulnerable. His rule was challenged in Syria in 1389 during a revolt by the Mamluk governor of Malatya, Mintash, and the governor of Aleppo, Yalbugha an-Nasiri, who was a former mamluk of both an-Nasir Hasan and Yalbugha al-Umari.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 291. The rebels took over Syria and headed for Egypt, prompting Barquq to abdicate in favor of as-Salih Hajji. The alliance between Yalbugha an-Nasiri and Mintash soon fell apart, however, and factional fighting ensued in Cairo ending with Mintash ousting Yalbugha. Barquq was arrested and exiled to al-Karak where he was able to rally support for his return to the throne. In Cairo, Barquq's loyalists took over the citadel and arrested as-Salih Hajji. This paved the way for Barquq's usurpation of the sultanate once more in February 1390, firmly establishing the Burji regime. Barquq solidified his control over the sultanate in 1393, when his forces killed the major opponent to his rule, Mintash, in Syria. Barquq's reign saw the mass recruitment of Circassians (estimated at 5,000 recruitsGarcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 300.) into the mamluk ranks and the restoration of the Mamluk state's authority throughout its realm in the tradition of the early Mamluk sultans, Baybars and Qalawun.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 290. A major innovation to this system by Barquq was the division of Egypt into three provinces (niyabat) similar to the administrative divisions in Syria. The new Egyptian niyabas were Alexandria, Damanhur and Asyut.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 314. Barquq instituted this change as a means to better control the Egyptian countryside from the rising strength of the Arab tribes.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, pp. 290‚Äì291. To that end, Barquq dispatched the Berber Hawwara tribesmen of the Nile Delta to Upper Egypt to keep the Arab tribes in check. During Barquq's reign, in 1387, the Mamluks were able to force the Anatolian entity in Sivas to become a Mamluk vassal state. Towards the end of the 14th century, challengers to the Mamluks emerged in Anatolia, including the Ottoman dynasty who absorbed the territory of the Karamanids in central Anatolia and installed a vassal as the leader of the Dulkadirids in 1399, and the Turkic allies of Timur, the Aq Qoyonlu and Kara Qoyounlu tribes who entered southern and eastern Anatolia in the same time period. Barquq entered into a brief engagement with Timur at the Euphrates in 1394, but Timur withdrew during that episode. Crises and restoration of state power Barquq died in 1399 and was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son, an-Nasir Faraj, who was in Damascus at the time.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, pp. 291‚Äì292. In that same year, Timur invaded Syria, sacking Aleppo before proceeding to sack Damascus. The latter had been abandoned by Faraj and his late father's entourage, who left for Cairo. Timur ended his occupation of Syria in 1402 to pursue his war against the Ottomans in Anatolia, who he deemed to be a more dangerous threat to his rule. Faraj was able to hold onto power during this turbulent period, which in addition to Timur's devastating raids, the rise of Turkic tribes in Jazira and attempts by Barquq's emirs to topple Faraj, also saw a famine in Egypt in 1403, a severe plague in 1405 and a Bedouin revolt that virtually ended the Mamluks' hold over Upper Egypt between 1401 and 1413. Thus, Mamluk authority throughout the sultanate was significantly eroded, while the capital Cairo experienced an economic crisis. Faraj was toppled in 1412 by the Syria-based emirs, Tanam, Jakam, Nawruz and al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh, who Faraj sent a total of seven military expeditions against during his reign. The emirs could not usurp the throne themselves, however, and had Caliph al- Musta'in installed; the caliph had the support of the non-Circassian mamluks and legitimacy with the local population. Six months later, Shakyh eased al- Musta'in out of power after neutralizing his main rival, Nawruz, and assumed the sultanate. Shaykh's main goal in office was restoration of the state's authority within the sultanate, which saw further plagues in 1415‚Äì1417 and 1420.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, pp. 292‚Äì293. During his reign, Shaykh reestablished the state's fiscal administration to replenish the treasury.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 293. To that end, his fiscal administrator led tax collection expeditions that were akin to plundering throughout the sultanate to compensate for the tax arrears that had accumulated under Faraj's reign. Shaykh also commissioned and led military expeditions against the Mamluks' enemies in Anatolia, reasserting the state's influence in that region. Reign of Barsbay Before Shaykh died in 1421, he sought to offset the power of the Circassian mamluks by importing Turkish mamluks and installing a Turk as atabeg al-asakir in 1420 to serve as regent for his infant son Ahmad. However, following his death, a Circassian emir, Tatar, married Shaykh's widow, ousted the atabeg al-asakir and assumed power. Tatar died three months into his reign and was succeeded by Barsbay, another Circassian emir of Barquq, in 1422. Barsbay pursued an economic policy of establishing state monopolies over the lucrative trade with Europe, particularly regarding spices, to the chagrin of the civilian merchants of the sultanate.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, p. 294. Moreover, Barsbay compelled Red Sea traders to offload their goods at the Mamluk-held Hejazi port of Jeddah rather than the Yemeni port of Aden in order to derive the most financial benefit from the Red Sea transit route to Europe. Barsbay also undertook efforts to better protect the caravan routes to the Hejaz from Bedouin raids and the Egyptian Mediterranean coast from Catalan and Genoese piracy. With regards to European pirates, he launched campaigns against Cyprus in 1425‚Äì1426, during which the island's king was taken captive, because of his alleged assistance to the pirates; the large ransoms paid to the Mamluks by the Cypriots allowed them to mint new gold coinage for the first time since the 14th century. Barsbay's efforts at monopolization and trade protection were meant to offset the severe financial losses of the sultanate's agricultural sector due to the frequent recurring plagues that took a heavy toll on the farmers.Garcin, ed. Petry 1998, pp. 293‚Äì294. Barsbay launched military expeditions against the Aq Qoyonlu in 1429 and 1433. The first expedition involved the sacking of Edessa and the massacre of its Muslim inhabitants in retaliation for the Aq Qoyonlu's raids against the Mamluks' Mesopotamian territories. The second expedition was against the Aq Qoyonlu capital of Amid, which ended with the Aq Qoyonlu recognizing Mamluk suzerainty. While the Mamluks were able to force the Anatolian beyliks to generally submit to their hegemony in the region, Mamluk authority in Upper Egypt was largely relegated to the emirs of the Hawwara tribe. The latter had grown wealthy from their burgeoning trade with central Africa and achieved a degree of local popularity due to their piety, education and generally benign treatment of the inhabitants. =Fall= Sultan Selim I in Egypt (1517) While the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II was engaged in Europe, a new round of conflict broke out between Egypt and the Safavid dynasty in Persia in 1501. Shah Ismail I sent an embassy to Venice and Syria inviting them to join arms and recover the territory taken from them by the Ottoman Empire. The Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghawri was warned by the Ottoman sultan Selim I that al-Ghawri was providing the envoys of the Ismail I safe passage through Syria on their way to Venice and harboring refugees. To appease him, al-Ghawri placed in confinement the Venetian merchants then in Syria and Egypt, but after a year released them. After the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, Selim I attacked the Dulkadirids, an Egyptian vassal, and sent their chief's head to al-Ghawri. Secure now against Ismail I, in 1516 he drew together a great army aiming at conquering Egypt, but to obscure the fact he presented the mobilisation of his army as being part of the war against Ismail I. The war started in 1516 which led to the later incorporation of Egypt and its dependencies in the Ottoman Empire, with Mamluk cavalry proving no match for the Ottoman artillery and the janissaries. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, al-Ghawri was killed. Syria passed into Ottoman possession, and the Ottomans were welcomed in many places as deliverance from the Mamluks. The Mamluk Sultanate survived until 1517, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman sultan Selim I captured Cairo on January 20, the center of power transferred then to Constantinople. On January 25, the Mamluk Sultanate collapsed. Although not in the same form as under the Sultanate, the Ottoman Empire retained the Mamluks as an Egyptian ruling class and the Mamluks and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of their influence, but remained vassals of the Ottomans. Although the Mamluk Sultanate was ended by the Ottoman conquest, the Mamluks as a \\"self-perpetuating, largely Turkish- speaking warrior class\\" continued to influence politics under Ottoman rule. Between 1688 and 1755, Mamluk beys, allied with Bedouin and factions within the Ottoman garrison, deposed no fewer than thirty-four governors. The Mamluk influence remained a force in Egyptian politics until their abrupt end at the hands of Muhammad Ali in 1811. SocietyLanguage= By the time the Mamluks took power, Arabic had already been established as the language of religion, culture and the bureaucracy in Egypt, and was widespread among non- Muslim communities there as well.Britannica, p. 114. Arabic's wide use among Muslim and non-Muslim commoners had likely been motivated by their aspiration to learn the language of the ruling and scholarly elite. Another contributing factor was the wave of Arab tribal migration to Egypt and subsequent intermarriage between Arabs and the indigenous population. The Mamluks contributed to the expansion of Arabic in Egypt through their victory over the Mongols and the Crusaders and the subsequent creation of a Muslim haven in Egypt and Syria for Arabic-speaking immigrants from other conquered Muslim lands. The continuing invasions of Syria by Mongol armies led to further waves of Syrian immigrants, including scholars and artisans, to Egypt. Although Arabic was used as the administrative language of the sultanate, Turkish was the spoken language of the Mamluk ruling elite.Winter, ed. Philipp and Haarmann 1998, p. 96. According to Petry, \\"the Mamluks regarded Turkish as their caste's vehicle of communication, even though they themselves spoke Central Asian dialects such as Qipjak, or Circassian, a Caucasic language.\\"Petry 1981, p. 70. According to historian Michael Winter, \\"Turkishness\\" was the distinctive aspect of the Mamluk ruling elite, for only they knew how to speak Turkish and had Turkish names. While the Mamluk elite was ethnically diverse, those who were not Turkic in origin were Turkicized nonetheless. As such, the ethnically Circassian mamluks who gained prominence with the rise of the Burji regime and became the dominant ethnic element of the government, were educated in the Turkish language and were considered to be Turks by the Arabic-speaking population. The ruling military elite of the sultanate was exclusive to those of mamluk background, with rare exceptions.Rabbat 2001, pp. 60‚Äì61. Ethnicity served as a major factor separating the mostly Turkic or Turkicized Mamluk elite from their Arabic- speaking subjects.Powell 2012, p. 21. Ethnic origin was a key component of an individual mamluk's identity, and ethnic identity manifested itself through given names, dress, access to administrative positions and was indicated by a sultan's nisba.Yosef 2012, p. 394. The sons of mamluks, known as the awlad al- nas, did not typically hold positions in the military elite and instead, were often part of the civilian administration or the Muslim religious establishment.Rabbat 2001, p. 60. Among the Bahri sultans and emirs, there existed a degree of pride of their Kipchak Turkish roots, and their non- Kipchak usurpers such as sultans Kitbuqa, Baybars II and Lajin were often de- legitimized in the Bahri-era sources for their non-Kipchak origins.Yosef 2012, p. 395. The Mamluk elites of the Burji period were also apparently proud of their Circassian origins. =Religion=Muslim community A copy of the Quran from the Mamluk era, dated circa 1380 A wide range of Islamic religious expression existed in Egypt during the early Mamluk era, namely Sunni Islam and its major madhabs (schools of thought) and various Sufi orders, but also small communities of Ismai'li Shia Muslims,Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 265. particularly in Upper Egypt. In addition, there was a significant minority of Coptic Christians.Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 266. Under Sultan Saladin, the Ayyubids embarked on a program of reviving and strengthening Sunni Islam in Egypt to counter Christianity, which had been reviving under the religiously benign rule of the Fatimids, and Ismailism, the branch of Islam of the Fatimid state. Under the Bahri sultans, the promotion of Sunni Islam was pursued more vigorously than under the Ayyubids. The Mamluks were motivated in this regard by personal piety or political expediency for Islam was both an assimilating and unifying factor between the Mamluks and the majority of their subjects; the early mamluks had been brought up as Sunni Muslims and the Islamic faith was the only aspect of life shared between the Mamluk ruling elite and its subjects.Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, pp. 268‚Äì269. While the precedent set by the Ayyubids highly influenced the Mamluk state's embrace of Sunni Islam,Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 268. the circumstances in the Muslim Middle East in the aftermath of the Crusader and Mongol invasions also left Mamluk Egypt as the last major Islamic power able to confront the Crusaders and the Mongols.Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 269. Thus, the early Mamluk embrace of Sunni Islam also stemmed from the pursuit of a moral unity within their realm based on the majority views of its subjects. The Mamluks sought to cultivate and utilize Muslim leaders to channel the religious feelings of the sultanate's Muslim subjects in a manner that did not disrupt the sultanate's authority.Britannica, p. 114. Similar to their Ayyubid predecessors, the Bahri sultans showed particular favoritism towards the Shafi'i madhab, while also promoting the other major Sunni madhabs, namely the Maliki, Hanbali and Hanafi. Baybars ended the Ayyubid and early Mamluk tradition of selecting a Shafi'i scholar as qadi al-qudah (chief judge) and instead had a qadi al-qudah appointed from each of the four madhabs. This policy change may have been partly motivated by a desire to accommodate an increasingly diverse Muslim population whose components had immigrated to Egypt from regions where other madhabs were prevalent. Ultimately, however, the diffusion of the post of qadi al-qudah among the four madhabs enabled Mamluk sultans to act as patrons for each madhab and thus gain more influence over them. Regardless of the policy change, the Shafi'i scholars maintained a number of privileges over their colleagues from the other madhabs. The Mamluks also embraced the various Sufi orders that existed in the sultanate. Sufism was widespread in Egypt by the 13th century, and the Shadhiliyyah was the most popular Sufi order.Northrup, ed. Petry 1998, p. 267. The Shadhiliyyah lacked an institutional structure and was flexible in its religious thought, allowing it to easily adapt to its local environment. It incorporated Sunni Islamic piety with its basis in the Qur'an and hadith, Sufi mysticism, and elements of popular religion such as sainthood, ziyarat (visitation) to the tombs of saintly or religious individuals, and dhikr (invocation of God). Other Sufi orders with large numbers of adherents were the Rifa'iyyah and Badawiyyah. While the Mamluks patronized the Sunni ulama through appointments to government office, they patronized the Sufis by funding zawiyas (Sufi lodges). On the other end of the spectrum of Sunni religious expression were the teachings of the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, which emphasized stringent moral rigor based on literal interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and a deep hostility to the aspects of mysticism and popular religious innovations promoted by the various Sufi orders. While Ibn Taymiyyah was not a typical representative of Sunni orthodoxy in the sultanate, he was the most prominent Muslim scholar of the Mamluk era and was arrested numerous times by the Mamluk government for his religious teachings, which are still influential in the modern-day Muslim world. Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrines were regarded as being heretic by the Sunni establishment patronized by the Mamluks.Britannica, pp. 114‚Äì115. Christian and Jewish communities Christians and Jews in the sultanate were governed by the dual authority of their respective religious institutions and the sultan.Stilt 2011, p. 109. The authority of the former extended to many of the everyday aspects of Christian and Jewish life and was not restricted to the religious practices of the two respective communities. The Mamluk government, often under the official banner of the Pact of Umar which gave Christians and Jews dhimmi (protected peoples) status, ultimately determined the taxes that Christians and Jews paid to the sultanate, including the jizyah (tax on non-Muslims), whether a house of worship could be constructed and the public appearance of Christians and Jews. Jews generally fared better than Christians, and the latter experienced more difficulty under Mamluk rule than under previous Muslim powers.Britannica, p. 115. The association of Christians with the Mongols, due to the latter's use of Armenian and Georgian Christian auxiliaries, the attempted alliance between the Mongols and the Crusader powers, and the massacre of Muslim communities and the sparing of Christians in cities captured by the Mongols, may have contributed to rising anti-Christian sentiments in the Mamluk era.Britannica, pp. 115‚Äì116. The manifestations of anti-Christian hostility were mostly spearheaded at the popular level rather than under the direction of Mamluk sultans. The main source of popular hostility was resentment at the privileged positions many Christians held in the Mamluk bureaucracy.Britannica, p. 116. The Coptic decline in Egypt occurred under the Bahri sultans and accelerated further under the Burji regime.Teule 2013, p. 10. There were several instances of Egyptian Muslim protests against the wealth of Coptic Christians and their employment with the state, and both Muslim and Christian rioters burned down each other's houses of worship in times of intercommunal tensions. As a result of popular pressure, Coptic Christians had their employment in the bureaucracy terminated at least nine times between the late 13th and mid-15th centuries, and on one occasion, in 1301, the government ordered the closure of all churches. Coptic bureaucrats would often be restored to their positions after the moment of tension passed.Stilt, p. 120. Many Coptic Christians decided to convert to Islam or at least adopt the outward expressions of Muslim faith to protect their employment, avoid jizyah taxation and avoid official measures against them. The 14th century saw a large wave of Coptic conversions to Islam, and by the end of the Mamluk period, the ratio of Muslims to Christians in Egypt may have risen to 10:1. In Syria, the Mamluks uprooted the local Maronite and Greek Orthodox Christians from the coastal areas as a means to prevent their potential contact with European powers.Teule 2013, p. 11. The Maronite Church was especially suspected by the Mamluks of collaboration with the Europeans due to the high degree of relations between the Maronite Church and the papacy in Rome and the Christian European powers, particularly Cyprus. The Greek Orthodox Church experienced a decline following the Mamluk destruction of its spiritual center, Antioch, and the Timurid destruction of Aleppo and Damascus in 1400. The Syriac Christians also experienced a significant decline in Syria due to intra-communal disputes over patriarchal succession and the destruction of churches by the Timurids or local Kurdish tribes.Teule 2013, p. 12. The Mamluks brought about a similar decline of the Armenian Orthodox Church after their capture of the Armenian Cilician Kingdom in 1374, in addition to the raids of the Timurids in 1386 and the conflict between the Timurids and the nomadic Turkmen Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Qoyonlu tribal confederations in Cilicia.Teule 2013, p. 13. =Bedouin relationship with the state= Bedouin tribes served as a reserve force in the Mamluk military.Levanoni 1995, p. 173. Under the third reign of an-Nasir Muhammad in particular, the Bedouin tribes, particularly those of Syria, such as the Al Fadl, were strengthened and integrated into the economy as well. Bedouin tribes were also a major source of the Mamluk cavalry's Arabian horses.Levanoni 1995, p. 175. Qalawun purchased horses from the Bedouin of Barqa, which were inexpensive but of high quality, while an-Nasir Muhammad spent extravagant sums for horses from numerous Bedouin sources, including Barqa, Syria, Iraq and Bahrayn (eastern Arabia). Sultans Baybars and Qalawun, and the Syrian viceroys of an-Nasir Muhammad during his first two reigns, emirs Salar and Baybars II, were averse to granting Bedouin sheikhs iqta øat, and when they did, the iqta øat were of low quality.Levanoni 1995, p. 176. However, during an-Nasir Muhammad's third reign, the Al Fadl were granted high-quality iqta øat in abundance, strengthening the tribe to become the most powerful among the Bedouin of the Syrian Desert region.Levanoni 1995, pp. 176‚Äì177. Beyond his personal admiration of the Bedouin, an-Nasir Muhammad's motivation for distributing iqta øat to Al Fadl, especially under the leadership of Muhanna ibn Isa, was to prevent them from defecting to the Ilkhanate, which their leaders had done frequently in the first half of the 14th century. Competition over iqta øat and the post of amir al- øarab (chief commander of the Bedouin) among the Bedouin tribes of Syria, particularly the Al Fadl, led to conflict and rebellion among the tribes, leading to mass bloodshed in Syria in the aftermath of an-Nasir Muhammad's death.Levanoni 1995, pp. 179‚Äì180. The Mamluk leadership in Syria, weakened by the losses of the Black Plague, was unable to quell the Bedouin through military expeditions, so they resolved to assassinate the sheikhs of the tribes. The Al Fadl tribe eventually lost favor, while the Bedouin tribes of al-Karak were strengthened by the later Bahri sultans. In Egypt, the Mamluks, particularly during an-Nasir Muhammad's third reign, had a similar relationship with the Bedouin as in Syria. The 'Isa Ibn Hasan al-Hajjan tribe became powerful in the country after being assigned massive iqta øat.Levanoni 1995, pp. 182. The tribe remained strong after an-Nasir Muhammad's death, but frequently rebelled against the succeeding Bahri sultans, but were restored each time, before its sheikh was finally executed as a rebel in 1353. In Sharqiya in Lower Egypt, the Tha'laba tribes were charged with overseeing the postal routes, but they were often unreliable in this regard and ultimately joined the Al A'id tribes during their raids. Bedouin tribal wars frequently disrupted trade and travel in Upper Egypt, and caused the destruction of cultivated lands and sugar processing plants.Levanoni, pp. 182‚Äì183. In the mid-14th century, Bedouin tribes in Upper Egypt, namely the rival Arak and Banu Hilal, became the de facto rulers of the region, forcing the Mamluks to rely on them for tax collection. The Bedouin were ultimately purged from Upper and Lower Egypt by the campaigns of Emir Shaykhu in 1353.Levanoni 1995, p. 183. Government The Mamluks did not significantly alter the administrative, legal and economic systems that they inherited from the Ayyubid state.Stilt 2011, p. 14. The Mamluk territorial domain was virtually the same as that of the Ayyubid state i.e. Egypt, the Levant and the Hejaz (western Arabia).Holt 1975, p. 237. However, unlike the collective sovereignty of the Ayyubids where territory was divided among members of the royal family, the Mamluk state was unitary. Under certain Ayyubid sultans, Egypt had paramountcy over the Syrian provinces, but under the Mamluks this paramountcy was consistent and absolute. Cairo remained the capital of the sultanate and its social, economic and administrative center, with the Cairo Citadel serving as the sultan's headquarters. =Authority of the sultan= The Mamluk sultan was the ultimate government authority, while he delegated power to provincial governors known as nuwwab as-saltana (deputy sultans, sing. na'ib as-saltana). Generally, the vice- regent of Egypt was the most senior na'ib, followed by the governor of Damascus, then Aleppo, then the governors of al-Karak, Safad, Tripoli, Homs and Hama. In Hama, the Mamluks had permitted the Ayyubids to continue to govern until 1341 (its popular governor in 1320, Abu'l Fida, was granted the honorary title of sultan by an-Nasir Muhammad), but otherwise the nuwwab of the provinces were Mamluk emirs. A consistent accession process occurred with every new Mamluk sultan.Holt 1975, p. 238. It more or less involved the election of a sultan by a council of emirs and mamluks (who would give him an oath of loyalty), the sultan's assumption of the monarchical title al-malik, a state-organized procession through Cairo at the head of which was the sultan, and the reading of the sultan's name in the khutbah (Friday prayer sermon). The process was not formalized and the electoral body was never defined, but typically consisted of the emirs and mamluks of whatever Mamluk faction held sway; usurpations of the throne by rival factions were relatively common.Holt 1975, p. 239. Despite the electoral nature of accession, dynastic succession was nonetheless a reality at times, particularly during the Bahri regime, where Baybars' sons Barakah and Solamish succeeded him, before Qalawun usurped the throne and was thereafter succeeded by four generations of direct descendants, with occasional interruptions. Hereditary rule was much less frequent during the Burji regime. Nonetheless, with rare exception, the Burji sultans were all linked to the regime's founder Barquq through blood or mamluk affiliation.Holt 1975, p. 240. The accession of blood relatives to the sultanate was often the result of the decision or indecision of senior Mamluk emirs or the will of the preceding sultan. The latter situation applied to the sultans Baybars, Qalawun, the latter's son, an-Nasir Muhammad and Barquq, who formally arranged for one or more of their sons to succeed them. More often than not, the sons of sultans were elected by the senior emirs with the ultimate intention that they serve as convenient figureheads presiding over an oligarchy of the emirs. Lesser-ranked Mamluk emirs viewed the sultan more as a peer whom they entrusted with ultimate authority and as a benefactor whom they expected would guarantee their salaries and monopoly on the military.Petry, ed. Petry 1998, p. 468. When emirs felt the sultan was not ensuring their benefits, disruptive riots, coup plots or delays to calls for service were all likely scenarios. Often, the practical restrictions on a sultan's power came from his own khushdashiyyah,Holt 1975, p. 248. defined by historian Amalia Levanoni as \\"the fostering of a common bond between mamluks who belonged to the household of a single master and their loyalty towards him.\\"Levanoni 1995, p. 14. The foundation of Mamluk organization and factional unity was based on the principles of khushdashiyya, which was a crucial component of a sultan's authority and power. Besides his khushdashiyyah, the sultan derived power from other emirs, with whom there was constant tension, particularly in times of peace with external enemies. According to Holt, the factious nature of emirs who were not the sultan's khushdashiyyah derived from the primary loyalty of emirs and mamluks to their own ustadh (master) before the sultan. However, emirs who were part of the sultan's khushdashiyyah also rebelled at times, particularly the governors of Syria who formed power bases within their territory. Typically, the faction most loyal to the sultan were the Royal Mamluks, particularly those mamluks whom the sultan had personally recruited and manumitted. This was in contrast to the qaranis, who were those in the Royal Mamluks' ranks who had been recruited by a sultan's predecessors and thus lacked khushdashiyyah bonds with the sultan. The qaranis occasionally constituted a hostile faction to a sultan, such as in the case of Sultan as- Salih Ayyub and the Qalawuni successors of an-Nasir Muhammad. The sultan was the head of state and among his powers and responsibilities were issuing and enforcing specific legal orders and general rules, making the decision to go to war, levying taxes for military campaigns, ensuring the proportionate distribution of food supplies throughout the sultanate and, in some cases, overseeing the investigation and punishment of alleged criminals.Stilt 2011, p. 31. A Mamluk sultan or his appointees led the annual Hajj pilgrimage caravans from Cairo and Damascus in the capacity of amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). Starting with Qalawun, the Mamluks also monopolized the tradition of providing the annual decorated covering of the Kaaba, in addition to patronizing Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Another prerogative, at least of the early Bahri sultans, was to import as many mamluks as possible into the sultanate, preferring those who originated from the territories of the Mongols. However, the Mamluks' enemies, such as the Mongol powers and their Muslim vassals, the Armenians and the Crusaders, successfully disrupted the flow of mamluks into the sultanate.Levanoni 1995, pp. 31‚Äì32. Unable to meet the military's need for new mamluks, the sultans often resorted to turning Ilkhanid deserters or prisoners of war into soldiers, sometimes while the war the prisoners were captured in was still ongoing. =Role of the caliph= To legitimize their rule, the Mamluks presented themselves as the defenders of Islam, and, beginning with Baybars, sought the confirmation of their executive authority from a caliph. The Ayyubids had owed their allegiance to the Abbasid Caliphate, but the latter was destroyed when the Mongols sacked the Abbasid capital Baghdad in 1258 and killed Caliph al-Musta'sim.Stilt 2011, p. 30. Three years later, Baybars reestablished the institution of the caliphate by making a member of the Abbasid family, al-Mustansir, caliph, who in turn confirmed Baybars as sultan.Stilt 2011, pp. 30‚Äì31. In addition, the caliph recognized the sultan's authority over Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Diyarbakir, the Hejaz and Yemen and any territory conquered from the Crusaders or Mongols.Holt 2005, p. 243. Al-Mustansir's Abbasid successors continued in their official capacity as caliphs, but virtually held no power in the Mamluk government. The less than year-long reign of Caliph al-Musta'in as sultan in 1412 was an anomaly. In an anecdotal testament to the caliph's lack of real authority, a group of rebellious mamluks responded to Sultan Lajin's presentation of the Caliph al-Hakim's decree asserting Lajin's authority with the following comment, recorded by Ibn Taghribirdi: \\"Stupid fellow. For God's sake‚Äîwho pays any heed to the caliph now?\\" =Military and administrative hierarchy= The Mamluk sultans were products of the military hierarchy, entry into which was virtually restricted to mamluks, i.e. those soldiers who were imported while young slaves. However, the sons of mamluks could enter and rise high within the ranks of the military hierarchy,Stilt 2011, pp. 22‚Äì23. but typically did not enter military service. Instead, many entered into mercantile, scholastic or other civilian careers.Stilt 2011, p. 20. The army Baybars inherited consisted of Kurdish and Turkic tribesmen, refugees from the various Ayyubid armies of Syria and other troops from armies dispersed by the Mongols.Levanoni 1995, p. 8. Following the Battle of Ain Jalut, Baybars restructured the army into three components: the Royal Mamluk regiment, the soldiers of the emirs, and the halqa (non-mamluk soldiers). The Royal Mamluks, who were under the direct command of the sultan, were the highest-ranking body within the army, entry into which was exclusive. The Royal Mamluks were virtually the private corps of the sultan. The lower-ranking emirs also had their own corps, which were akin to private armies. The soldiers of the emirs were directly commanded by the emirs, but could be mobilized by the sultan when needed. As emirs were promoted, the number of soldiers in their corps increased, and when rival emirs challenged each other's authority, they would often utilize their respective forces, leading to major disruptions of civilian life. The halqa had inferior status to the mamluk regiments. It had its own administrative structure and was under the direct command of the sultan. The halqa regiments declined in the 14th century when professional non-mamluk soldiers generally stopped joining the force.Levanoni 1995, pp. 8‚Äì9. The Ayyubid army had lacked a clear and permanent hierarchical system and one of Baybars' early reforms was creating a military hierarchy.Levanoni 1995, p. 11. To that end, he began the system of assigning emirs ranks of ten, forty and one hundred, with the particular number indicating how many mounted mamluk troops were assigned to an emir's command. In addition, an emir of one hundred could be assigned one thousand mounted troops during battle. Baybars instituted uniformity within the army and put an end to the previous improvised nature of the various Ayyubid military forces of Egypt and Syria.Levanoni 1995, p. 9. To bring further uniformity to the military, Baybars and Qalawun standardized the undefined Ayyubid policies regarding the distribution of iqta øat to emirs.Levanoni 1995, p. 10. The reformation of iqta ø distribution created a clear link between an emir's rank and the size of his iqta ø. For example, an emir of forty would be given an iqta ø a third of the size of an emir of one hundred's iqta ø. Baybars also began biweekly inspections of the troops to verify that sultanic orders were carried out, in addition to the periodic inspections in which he would distribute new weaponry to the mamluk troops. Starting with the reign of Qalawun, the sultan and the military administration maintained lists of all emirs throughout the sultanate and defined their roles as part of the right or left flanks of the army should they be mobilized for war. Gradually, as mamluks increasingly filled administrative and courtier posts within the state, Mamluk innovations to the Ayyubid hierarchy were developed.Levanoni 1995, pp. 11‚Äì12. The offices of ustadar (majordomo), hajib (chamberlain), emir jandar and khazindar (treasurer), which existed during the Ayyubid period, were preserved, but Baybars established the additional offices of dawadar, emir akhur, ru'us al- nawab and emir majlis.Levanoni 1995, p. 12. The administrative offices were largely ceremonial posts and were closely connected to various elements of the military hierarchy. The ustadar (from the Arabic ustadh al-dar, \\"master of the house\\") was the chief of staff of the sultan, responsible for organizing the royal court's daily activities, managing the personal budget of the sultan and supervising all of the buildings of the Cairo Citadel and its staff.Popper 1955, p. 93. The ustadar was often referred to as the ustadar al-aliyah (grand master of the house) to distinguish from ustadar saghirs (lesser majordomos) whose authority was subordinate to the ustadar al-aliyah and who oversaw specific aspects of the court and citadel, such as the sultan's treasury, private property and the kitchens of the citadel. Mamluk emirs also had their own ustadars. The office of ustadar al-aliyah became a powerful post beginning in the late 14th century,Binba≈ü 2014, p. 158. particularly so under sultans Barquq and an-Nasir Faraj, who transferred the responsibilities of the special bureau for their mamluks to the authority of the ustadar, thus turning the latter into the sultanate's chief financial official. Economy Mamluk Wool Carpet, Egypt, circa 1500-1550 The Mamluk economy essentially consisted of two spheres: the state economy, which was organized along the lines of an elite household and was controlled by a virtual caste government headed by the sultan, and the free market economy, which was the domain of society in general and which was associated with the native inhabitants in contrast to the ethnically foreign origins of the Mamluk ruling elite.Northrup 1998, p. 254. The Mamluks introduced greater centralization over the economy by organizing the state bureaucracy, particularly in Cairo (Damascus and Aleppo already had organized bureaucracies), and the Mamluk military hierarchy and its associated iqta ø system.Northrup 1998, p. 253. In Egypt in particular, the Nile River's centralizing influence also contributed to Mamluk centralization over the region. The Mamluks used the same currency system as the Ayyubids, which consisted of gold dinars, silver dirhams and copper fulus.Islahi 1988, p. 42. In general, the monetary system during the Mamluk period was highly unstable due to frequent monetary changes enacted by various sultans. Increased circulation of copper coins and the increased use of copper in dirhams often led to inflation.Islahi 1988, p. 43. The Mamluks created an administrative body called the hisbah to supervise the market, with a muhtasib (inspector-general) in charge of the body. There were four muhtasibs based in Cairo, Alexandria, al-Fustat and Lower Egypt. The muhtasib in Cairo was the most senior of the four and his position was akin to that of a finance minister. The role of a muhtasib was to inspect weights and measures and the quality of goods, maintain legal trade, and to remain vigilant of price gouging. Typically, a qadi or Muslim scholar would occupy the post, but in the 15th century, Mamluk emirs began to be appointed as muhtasibs in an effort to compensate emirs during cash shortages or as a result of the gradual shift of the muhtasib's role from the legal realm to one of enforcement.Elbendary 2015, pp. 38‚Äì39. =Iqta ø system= The iqta ø system was inherited from the Ayyubids and further organized under the Mamluks to fit their military needs.van Steenbergen, p. 475. Iqta øat were a central component of the Mamluk power structure.Elbendary 2015, p. 37. The iqta ø of the Muslims differed from the European concept of fiefs in that iqta ø represented a right to collect revenue from a fixed territory and was accorded to an officer (emir) as income and as a financial source to provision his soldiers. However, prior to the Mamluks' rise, there was a growing tendency of iqta ø holders to treat their iqta ø as personal property, which they passed down to their descendants. The Mamluks effectively put an end to this tendency, with the exception of some areas, namely in Mount Lebanon, where longtime Druze iqta ø holders, who became part of the halqa, were able to resist the abolition of their hereditary iqta øat. In the Mamluk era, the iqta ø was an emir's principal source of income,Elbendary 2015, pp. 37‚Äì38 and starting in 1337,Levanoni 1995, p. 171. Mamluk iqta ø holders would lease or sell rights to their iqta øat to non- mamluks in order to derive greater revenues. By 1343, the practice was common and by 1347, the sale of iqta'at became taxed. The revenues emanating from the iqta ø also served as a more stable source of income than other methods the Mamluks sometimes employed, including tax hikes, the sale of administrative posts and extortion of the population. According to historian J. van Steenbergen, > The iqta ø system was fundamental in assuring a legitimized, controlled and > guaranteed access to the resources of the Syro-Egyptian realm to an upper > level of Mamluk society that was primarily military in form and > organization. As such it was a fundamental feature of Mamluk society, on the > one hand giving way to a military hierarchy that crystallized into an even > more developed economic hierarchy and that had substantial economic > interests in society at large; on the other hand, it deeply characterized > the realm's economic and social development, its agriculture, grain trade, > and rural demography in particular. The system largely consisted of land assignments from the state in return for military services.van Steenbergen, p. 476. Land was assessed by the periodic rawk (cadastral survey), which consisted of a survey of land parcels (measured by feddan units), assessment of land quality and the annual estimated tax revenue of the parcels, and classification of a parcel's legal status as waqf (trust) or iqta ø. The rawk surveys organized the iqta ø system and the first rawk was carried out in 1298 under Sultan Lajin.Steenbergen, p. 477. A second and final rawk was completed in 1315 under Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad and influenced political and economic developments of the Mamluk Sultanate until its fall in the early 16th century. Over time, the iqta ø system was expanded, and increasingly larger areas of kharaj (taxable lands) were appropriated as iqta ø lands in order to meet the fiscal needs of the Mamluk military institution, namely payment of Mamluk officers and their subordinates. The Mamluk state resolved to increase allotments by dispersing an individual emir's iqta øat over several provinces and for brief terms. However, this led to a situation where the iqta ø holders neglected the administrative oversight, maintenance and infrastructure of their iqta øat, while concentrating solely on collecting revenues, thereby resulting in less productivity of the iqta øat. =Agriculture= Agriculture was the primary source of revenue in the Mamluk economy.Stilt 2011, p. 23. Agricultural products were the main exports of Mamluk Egypt, Syria and Palestine. Moreover, the major industries of sugar and textile production were also dependent on agricultural products, namely sugar cane and cotton, respectively. Every agricultural commodity was taxed by the state, with the sultan's treasury taking the largest share of the revenues; emirs and major private brokers followed. An emir's main source of income were the agricultural products of his iqta ø, and with those revenues, he was able to fund his private corps.Stilt 2011, p. 24. In Egypt, Mamluk centralization over agricultural production was more thorough than in Syria and Palestine for a number of reasons. Among them was that virtually all agriculture in Egypt depended on a single source of irrigation, the Nile, and the measures and rights to irrigation were determined by the river's flooding, whereas in Syria and Palestine, there were multiple sources of mostly rain-fed irrigation, and measures and rights were thus determined at the local level.Northrup, p. 270. Centralization over Syria and Palestine was also more complicated than in Egypt due to the diversity of those regions' geography and the frequent invasions of the Syro-Palestinian territories. The state's role in Syro- Palestinian agriculture was restricted to the fiscal administration and to the irrigation networks and other aspects of rural infrastructure.Northrup 1998, p. 269. Although the level of centralization was not as high as in Egypt, the Mamluks did impose enough control over the Syrian economy to derive revenues from Syria that benefited the sultanate and contributed to the defense of its realm. Furthermore, the maintenance of the Mamluk army in Syria relied on the state's control over Syrian agricultural revenues.Northrup 1998, p. 277. Among the responsibilities of a Mamluk provincial or district governor were repopulating depopulated areas to foster agricultural production, protecting the lands from Bedouin raids, increasing productivity in barren lands (likely through the upkeep and expansion of existing irrigation networks),Northrup 1998, p. 271. and devoting special attention to the cultivation of the more arable low-lying regions. In order to ensure that rural life was undisturbed by Bedouin raiding, which could halt agricultural work or damage crops and agrarian infrastructure and thus decrease revenues, the Mamluks attempted to prevent Bedouin armament and confiscate existing weapons from them.Northrup 1998, p. 261. =Trade and industry= Mamluk-era astrolabe, dated 1282 Egypt and Syria played a central transit role in international trade in the Middle Ages.Islahi 1988, p. 39. Early into their rule, the Mamluks sought to expand their role in foreign trade, and to this end Baybars signed a commercial treaty with Genoa, while Qalawun signed a similar agreement with Ceylon.Islahi 1988, p. 40. By the 15th century, internal upheaval as a result of Mamluk power struggles, diminishing iqta ø revenues as a result of plagues, and the encroachment of abandoned farmlands by Bedouin tribes led to a financial crisis in the sultanate.Christ 2012, p. 32. To make up for these losses, the Mamluks applied a three-pronged approach: taxation of the urban middle classes, increasing the production and sale of cotton and sugar to Europe, and taking advantage of their transit position in the trade between the Far East and Europe.Christ 2012, p. 33. The latter proved to be the most profitable method and was done by cultivating trade relationships with Venetia, Genoa and Barcelona, and increasing taxes on commodities. Thus, during the 15th century, the long-established trade between Europe and the Islamic world began to make up a significant part of the sultanate's revenues as the Mamluks imposed taxes on the merchants who operated or passed through the sultanate's ports. Mamluk Egypt was a major producer of textiles and a supplier of raw materials for Western Europe.Petry 1981, p. 244. However, the frequent outbreaks of the Black Plague led to a decline in the Mamluk territories' production of goods such as textiles, silk products, sugar, glass, soaps, and paper, which coincided with the Europeans' increasing production of these goods. Trade continued nonetheless and despite papal restrictions on trade with the Muslims during the Crusades. Mediterranean trade was dominated by spices, such as pepper, muscat nuts and flowers, cloves and cinnamon, as well as medicinal drugs and indigo.Christ 2012, pp. 19‚Äì20. These goods originated in Persia, India, and Southeast Asia and made their way to Europe via the Mamluk ports of Syria and Egypt. These ports were frequented by European merchants, who in turn sold gold and silver ducats and bullion, silk, wool and linen fabrics, furs, wax, honey and cheeses. Under Sultan Barsbay, a state monopoly was established on luxury goods, namely spices, in which the state set prices and collected a percentage of profits. To that end, in 1387, Barsbay established direct control over Alexandria, the principal Egyptian commercial port, thereby transferring the tax revenues of the port to the sultan's personal treasury (diwan al-khass) instead of the imperial treasury which was linked with the military's iqta ø system.Christ 2012, pp. 33‚Äì34. Furthermore, in 1429, he ordered that the spice trade to Europe be conducted through Cairo before goods reached Alexandria, thus attempting to end the direct transportation of spices from the Red Sea to Alexandria. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries the Portuguese Empire's expansion into Africa and Asia began to significantly decrease the revenues of the Mamluk-Venetian monopoly on the trans-Mediterranean trade.Varlik 2015, p. 163. This contributed to and coincided with the fall of the sultanate.

Semiconductor devices depend on the distribution of carriers (electrons or holes) within their structures to provide the desired performance. The carrier concentration (which can vary by up to ten orders of magnitude) can be inferred from the resistivity profile provided by SRP.  History  The fundamental relationship is usually attributed to James Clerk Maxwell (1831‚Äì1879). In 1962, Robert Mazur (US Patent 3,628,137) and DickeyD. H. Dickey, The Electrochem. Soc., Electron. Div Ext. Abstr. 12, 151 (1963) developed a practical 2-probe system using a pair of weighted osmium needles. In 1970, Solid State Measurements was founded to manufacture spreading resistance profiling tools and in 1974, Solecon Labs was founded to provide spreading resistance profiling services. In 1980, Dickey developed a practical method of determining p- or n-type using the spreading resistance tool. Improvements have continued but have been challenged by the ever-shrinking dimensions of state-of-the-art digital devices. For shallow structures (<1 um deep), the data reduction is complex. Some of the contributors to the data reduction are Dickey,D. H. Dickey and J. R. Ehrstein, NBS Special Publication 400-48, (1979)D. H.

Casel and H. Jorke, Appl. Phys. Lett., 50, 989 (1987)  Theory of operation  If a voltage is applied between two probe tips providing electrical contact to an infinite slab, the resistance encountered within the slab is R\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{2a}, where: *R is the measured resistance in ohms, *\\\\rho (rho) is the resistivity of the slab in ohm-cm, and *a is the radius of the contact area in cm. Most of the resistance occurs very close to the electrical contactR. Holm, Electric Contacts, Almquist and Wiksels, Upsalla (1946) allowing the local resistivity to be determined. The probes produce a negligible probe to silicon resistance (nearly ohmic contact) over the entire resistivity range for both p-type and n-type (rich in holes and rich in electrons respectively). Keeping the resistance of wiring and the spreading resistance within the probe tips to a minimum, the measured resistance is almost exclusively from R\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{2a} for silicon samples at least 2a thick. With the aid of calibration resistivity standards, \\\\rho can be determined at each probing by the probe pair.  Instrumentation  A bias of 5mV is applied across the probe tips. The measured resistance can range from 1-ohm to one billion ohms. A \\"log R\\" amplifier or electrometer is used to measure the resistance.  Mechanical  500px The modern SRP has two tungsten carbide probe tips placed about 20 um apart. Each tip is mounted on a kinematic bearing to minimize \\"scrubbing\\". The probes are lowered very gently onto a beveled piece of silicon or germanium. Although the loading of the probe tips may be as little as 2 g., the pressure is in excess of one million pounds per sq inch (or ~ 10G pascals) causing a localized phase transformation in the silicon to ‚Äúbeta-tin‚Äù producing a nearly ohmic contact.J. C. Jamieson, Crystal Structures at High Pressures of Metallic Modification of Silicon and Germanium, Science, 139 (1963) Between each measurement, the probes are raised and indexed a pre-determined distance down the bevel. Bevels are produced by mounting the sample on an angle block and grinding the bevel with typically a 0.1- or 0.05-micrometre diamond paste. Bevel angles, chosen to fit the depth of interest, can range from ~ 0.001 to 0.2 radians. Care must be used to produce a smooth, flat bevel with minimum rounding of the bevel edge. (See Figure 1.)  Detection limits  The instrument range is typically from one ohm to one billion ohms. This is adequate for the entire resistivity range in single-crystal silicon.  Calibration  Calibration standards have been produced by NIST. A set of 16 standards ranging from about 0.0006 ohm-cm to 200 ohm-cm have been produced for both n- and p-type and for both (100) and (111) crystal orientations. For high resistivity (above 200 ohm-cm and perhaps above 40,000 ohm-cm) the resistivity value must extrapolated from the calibration curve.  Applications  The tool is used primarily for determining doping structures in silicon semiconductors. Deep and shallow profiles are shown in Figure 2. 900px Alternative processes Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is also very useful for dopant profiling. SIMS can provide the atomic concentration over three decades or in some cases, four decades of dynamic range. SRP can determine the carrier concentration (electrically active dopant) in more than eight or nine decades of dynamic range. Often, the techniques are complementary although sometimes competitive. The equipment for SIMS tends to be considerably more expensive to manufacture and operate. While spreading resistance is limited to silicon, germanium and a few other semiconductors, SIMS can profile the atomic concentration of almost anything in anything. SIMS has greater spatial resolution useful for ultra- shallow profiles (< 0.1-micrometre) but SRP is more convenient for deeper structures.  References  Bibliography  R. G. Mazur and D. H.

He was also a founding member of the elite Singaporean Art Group, Group 90, and a leading proponent to the development of figurative art in Singapore. Biography Born the eldest child of 9 siblings to a land owning family in India's old Madras Presidency, Namasivayam left his hometown at the age of 5 with his mother to join his father who was employed by the Central Electricity Board as a foreman-mechanic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. Resettling in his new home at the Board's accommodation quarters in Bangsa Road (present-day Petaling Jaya), 6-year-old Namasivayam briefly attended a private school in the Brickfields vicinity run by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was later transferred to a government Primary School at Batu Road, KL, after being recommended by a British engineer working with the Board, who spotted potential in him. It was here that the young Namasivayam first discovered his love for art, aided and nurtured by the encouragement of his teachers, who quickly noticed his natural aptitude for the subject. In 1939, he gained admission into KL's Victoria Institution, Malaya's premier Boys' school for his secondary education. There he gained a reputation amongst his classmates as a consummate sketcher, drawing constantly in between lessons, and excelling at the art lessons he was exposed to. In 1942, war came to Southeast Asia and his education was disrupted by the Japanese occupation of Malaya. When his father was transferred to work in Butterworth, Penang by the Japanese, Namasivayam continued his studies at a Japanese school in Prai town in Butterworth for 18 months before he was deployed to work as an engine mechanic at the local Japanese-controlled Railway Station. In 1943 the 17-year-old was press-ganged by the military authorities into working as a translator on the infamous Thailand-Burma Railway. where he experienced many personal hardships, near- death experiences and witnessed many untold horrors and atrocities. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, he made the arduous journey southwards on foot and railway from Siam to Malaya, where he had an emotional reunion with his family who thought he had perished during the war. He resumed his studies at Victoria Institution to complete his secondary education, where he also rediscovered his passion for art, depicting landscape scenes mainly with pencil and on occasions with watercolour. In 1947, at the age of 21 he completed his Senior Cambridge examinations at the Institution., and sought employment with a French oil palm plantation company called Socfin, as a laboratory assistant. As a young trainee teacher (far right) posing with wartime friends, KL, 1951 In 1950, Namasivayam headed south to Singapore in search of greener pastures, and enrolled himself at the Teachers' Training College, where they sent him as a trainee teacher to Tanjong Rhu Primary School. In 1954, he successfully passed out with National Training Certificate Diploma, and proceeded to teach at various schools as a primary school teacher. At Trafalgar Primary School, he was given his first opportunity to focus on teaching art. The then-Primary School principal Ms Tan Chee Chee gave Namasivayam full play in the development of the school arts programme, and through his guidance, his students won first place in art competitions held at Victoria Memorial Hall. In 1956, in accordance with family traditions, Namasivayam travelled to India to tie the knot in an arranged marriage. He then returned to Singapore with his new bride, Lakshmi, and resumed his teaching career. In 1957, Mr.Namasivayam's love and proficiency for teaching art came to the notice of Mr Goh Kong Beng, president of the Singapore Teachers' Union who subsequently recommended him for an art scholarship in Australia. He declined at first but eventually accepted it after being encouraged by other teachers in the School. Namasivayam eventually received the Colombo Plan Scholarship award to study art, along with four other trainee teachers Inche Suri Bin Mohyani, Chew Fook Chun, Seah Teow Puan and Sim Tong Khern, and left for Sydney on 11 March 1957. Upon graduation, Namasivayam returned to Singapore in August 1961. Upon his return he taught at various schools including Crescent Girls' School and Gan Eng Seng School. He was duly promoted to Lecturer at the Teachers' Training College and later, Senior Media Specialist at the Ministry of Education. In 1987 after retiring from the Ministry of Education, he was invited to take on the post as an art lecturer with the LASALLE College of the Arts. Mr. Namasivayam is a true legend in the arts arena and has left behind a rich legacy that illustrates multiple art forms that many Singaporeans cherish till this day.

Organization The military forces of the Confederate States had three services: * Confederate States Army ‚Äì The Confederate States Army (CSA) the land-based military operations. The CS Army was established in two phases with provisional and permanent organizations, which existed concurrently. ** The Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS) was authorized by Act of Congress on February 23, 1861, and began organizing on April 27. ** The Army of Confederate States was the regular army, organized by Act of Congress on March 6, 1861.Eicher, pg. 23 It was authorized to include 15,015 men, including 744 officers, but this level was never achieved. The men serving in the highest rank as Confederate States generals, such as Samuel Cooper and Robert E. Lee, were enrolled in the ACSA to ensure that they outranked all militia officers. ** Confederate States State militias were organized and commanded by the state governments, similar to those authorized by the United States Militia Act of 1792. **Confederate Home Guard ‚Äì a somewhat loosely organized though nevertheless legitimate organization that was under the vague direction and authority of the Confederate States of America, working in coordination with the Confederate Army, and was tasked with both the defense of the Confederate home front during the American Civil War, as well as to help track down and capture Confederate Army deserters. * Confederate States Navy ‚Äì responsible for Confederate naval operations during the American Civil War. The two major tasks of the Confederate Navy during the whole of its existence were the protection of Southern harbors and coastlines from outside invasion, and making the war costly for the North by attacking merchant ships and breaking the Union Blockade. * Confederate States Marine Corps ‚Äì Established by an act of the Congress of the Confederate States on March 16, 1861. The CSMC's manpower was initially authorized at 45 officers and 944 enlisted men, and was increased on September 24, 1862 to 1026 enlisted men. The organization of the Marines began at Montgomery, Alabama, and was completed at Richmond, Virginia, when the capital of the Confederate States of America was moved to that location. The CSMC headquarters and main training facilities remained in Richmond, Virginia, throughout the war, located at Camp Beall on Drewry's Bluff and at the Gosport Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia.Sharf, pp.769‚Äì772 Command and control Control and operation of the Confederate States Army was administered by the Confederate States War Department, which was established by the Confederate Provisional Congress in an act on February 21, 1861. The Confederate Congress gave control over military operations, and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the president of the Confederate States of America on February 28, 1861 and March 6, 1861. By May 8, a provision authorizing enlistments for war was enacted, calling for 400,000 volunteers to serve for one or three years. By April 1862, the Confederate States of America found it necessary to pass a conscription act, which drafted men into PACS. The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the United States Army and United States Navy who had resigned their federal commissions and had won appointment to senior positions in the Confederate armed forces. Many had served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but others had little or no military experience (such as Leonidas Polk, who had attended West Point.) The Confederate officer corps was composed in part of young men from slave-owning families, but many came from non-owners. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, many colleges of the South (such as the Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute) maintained cadet corps that were seen as a training ground for Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at Drewry's Bluff, Virginia,1862blackCSN in 1863, but no midshipmen had graduated by the time the Confederacy collapsed. The soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males with an average age between sixteen and twenty-eight. The Confederacy adopted conscription in 1862. Many thousands of slaves served as laborers, cooks, and pioneers. Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for \\"local defense, not combat.\\"Rubin pg. 104 Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In the spring of 1865 the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee's and Davis' recommendations, the Congress refused \\"to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers.\\" No more than two hundred troops were ever raised.Levine pg. 146‚Äì147 However, President Davis believed that blacks would not fight unless they were provided freedom in exchange for their service. Therefore, he waited until Congress adjourned and then stipulated by executive order than any African-American accepted into service on the congressional act must be a volunteer and be accompanied by manumission papers.William C.

The unit temporarily disbanded on February 15, 1862, after Louisiana law stated the militia could only be made up of white men. They were recalled to service during the Union invasion of New Orleans and permanently disbanded on April 25, 1862. Some of the soldiers later joined the Union Army. \\"Nearly 40% of the Confederacy's population were unfree ... the work required to sustain the same society during war naturally fell disproportionately on black shoulders as well.

Brown noted that \\"the country and the army are mainly dependent upon slave labor for support.\\"Journal of the Senate at an Extra Session of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia,, Convened under the Proclamation of the Governor, March 25, 1863, p. 6 Slave labor was used in a wide variety of support roles, from infrastructure and mining, to teamster and medical roles such as hospital attendants and nurses.Levine, Confederate Emancipation p. 62-63 The idea of arming slaves for use as soldiers was speculated on from the onset of the war, but not seriously considered by Davis or others in his administration.Levine, Confederate Emancipation p. 17-18 Though an acrimonious and controversial debate was raised by a letter from Patrick CleburneOfficial Records, Series I, Vol. LII, Part 2, pp. 586‚Äì92. urging the Confederacy to raise black soldiers by offering emancipation, it wouldn't be until Robert E. Lee wrote the Confederate Congress urging them that the idea would take serious traction. On March 13, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed General Order 14, and President Davis signed the order into law. The order was issued March 23, but only a few black companies were raised. Two companies were armed and drilled in the streets of Richmond, Virginia, shortly before the besieged southern capital fell. However, President Davis considered it imperative that blacks be offered freedom in exchange for military service under terms of the act passed through Congress. Therefore, he waited for Congress to adjourn and then stipulated by executive order that any African-Americans accepted as soldiers under terms of the act must be volunteers and be accompanied by manumission papers.William C. Davis \\"Jefferson Davis: The Man and The Hour\\" p. 599 Supply Much like the Continental Army in the American Revolution, state governments were supposed to supply their soldiers. The supply situation for most Confederate Armies was dismal even when victorious. The lack of central authority and effective transportation infrastructure, especially the railroads, combined the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Army's demise. Individual commanders had to \\"beg, borrow or steal\\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured Union depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against Gettysburg and southern Pennsylvania (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, namely food. Not surprisingly, in addition to slowing the Confederate advance such foraging aroused anger in the North and led many Northerners to support General Sherman's total warfare tactics as retaliation. Scorched earth policies especially in Georgia, South Carolina and the Virginian Shenandoah Valley proved far more devastating than anything Pennsylvania had suffered and further reduced the capacity of the increasingly effectively blockaded Confederacy to feed even its civilian population, let alone its Army. At many points during the war, and especially near the end, Confederate Armies were described as starving and, indeed, many died from lack of food and related illnesses. Towards more desperate stages of the war, the lack of food became a principal driving force for desertion. Uniforms See article: Uniforms of the Confederate Military The Uniforms of the Confederate States military forces were the uniforms used by the Confederate Army and Navy during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. The uniform varied greatly due to a variety of reasons, such as location, limitations on the supply of cloth and other materials, and the cost of materials during the war. Confederate forces were often poorly supplied with uniforms, especially late in the conflict. Servicemen sometimes wore combinations of uniform pieces combined with captured Union uniforms and items of personal clothing. They sometimes went without shoes altogether, and broad felt or straw hats were worn as often as kepis or naval caps. Statistics Total Service members ‚Äì 1,050,000 (Exact number is unknown.

It serves the general public as both a state historic site and a bed & breakfast with eight overnight rooms. Cesar and Hannah Monod, Swiss immigrants, arrived in Indianola, Texas in the 1830sWolff, Linda. Indianola and Matagorda Island 1837-1887. Eakin Press, Austin, Texas, 1999. and settled in Castroville, Texas above a busy crossing on the Medina River in 1849. They constructed a one-story limestone building used as a residence and a general store. They also built a detached commercial kitchen that was the working and living space for their enslaved woman, Harriet and her infant. In 1850, he bought the adjacent lot with a small house built by Alsatian immigrants Michel and Rosine Simon in 1847. Vance House in 2017 John and Rowena Vance purchased Monod's property in 1853 and added an ell wing to the general store to better serve travelers on the Old San Antonio Road that passed through Castroville on the way west to Eagle Pass, El Paso, and points beyond. In 1859, the Vances added a personal residence, which was the largest in Castroville at the time, and converted Simon's small house into a wash house for use in both bathing and clothes washing. As the town grew and traffic on the road increased after the Civil War, the Vances added a second story to the store building in 1874 to provide rooms for overnight guests. In 1854, the Vances sold the riverfront portion of his property to George L. Haass and Laurent Quintle, who built a dam on the river and constructed a water powered grist mill to process grain and gin cotton for local farmers. Joseph and Margarethe Courand, immigrants to Texas from Alsace, bought the mill in 1876 and made substantial improvements to it before his death three years later. When Joseph Jr. and Julia Courand took over from his parents, the mill was processing lumber, cotton, wheat, and over a million bushels of corn per year starting in the 1880s. The mill was the industrial center of Castroville until the 1920s.Parent, Laurence. Official Guide to Texas State Parks. University of Texas Press, Austin, Fourth printing, 2005. The Courands bought the Vance property in 1899 from John and Rowena's children, and converted the 1859 Vance residence into a warehouse. The Vance Hotel was rented periodically but was otherwise not maintained as it had been in the past. The Courands moved to San Antonio in 1903 but continued to manage the property and a separate general store on the town square in Castroville. Not willing to update technology in the early 1920s, the Courands posted the entire property for sale. Jordan T. Lawler bought the Courand property in 1925 and converted the mill to a hydroelectric plant to provide Castroville with electricity for the first time. In 1927, the Lawler siblings Jordan (1879-1970), Henry (1881-1967), and Ruth (1900-1990), along with their mother Carrie and Henry's family relocated to Castroville. Another sister, C. Genevieve Lawler (1891-1976), relocated in 1952 to Castroville with her partner Mary Ruth Lionberger (1900-1987). The historic hotel re-opened as the Landmark Inn on July 4, 1942, primarily serving military personnel between the air bases in San Antonio and Hondo. Ruth Lawler had the property designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1965 and designated as a contributing property in the surrounding Castroville Historic District in 1970. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in its own right in 1972.  State Historic Site  In 1974, the property was donated to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), which conducted extensive archaeological investigations and made significant repairs and improvements before opening the property to the public as a state historic site on October 25, 1981. TPWD also had the property designated as a Texas State Antiquities Landmark in 1983. On January 1, 2008, the site was transferred from TPWD to the Texas Historical Commission, which completed a two-year renovation and historic preservation project in December 2015. Tours, programs, and special events are offered regularly for visitors to the site. A new museum exhibit was installed in April 2017. Preservation Texas and the San Antonio Conservation Society recognized with awards in 2018 the historic preservation work accomplished.  Hotel  In addition to serving as a state historic site, the Landmark Inn is also a bed-and-breakfast-style hotel with eight rooms or overnight stays. The guest rooms are furnished with antiques and historical reproductions that are representative of the 1850s, 1880s, and 1920s, depending on the room. While the rooms have furnishings that reinforce the historical interpretation of the site, they also have modern conveniences, such as electricity, indoor plumbing, and climate control systems. Televisions and radios are not provided but free Wi-Fi is available.

He is most notable as the editor of the daily newpaper Le Soir and a leading exponent of \\"intellectual collaboration\\" in German-occupied Belgium during World War II De Becker was born in Brussels in 1912. He became involved in Catholic and far-right politics in the interwar years. He founded the Communaut√© group at Leuven and sympathised with the Maurrassian ideology of Action Fran√ßaise and the fascism of Benito Mussolini in Italy. He edited the newspaper Ind√©pendance from 1936 to 1939 and was a strong support of Belgian neutrality which he encouraged in a German-funded newspaper called Ouest from 1939. After the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940 he became a leading figure in \\"intellectual collaboration\\" in Belgium. He was made editor of Le Soir which had been expropriated from its pre-war owners Rossel & Cie and which was re-purposed to carry censored news and propaganda under German supervision. This edition was popularly dubbed \\"Stolen Le Soir\\" (Le Soir vol√©). De Becker was initially convinced that the creation of a German-led New Order in Europe was imminent and hoped for Belgium to retain some autonomy as an authoritarian state under German auspices. He expanded on these themes in an autobiographical essay published in 1942 as Livre des Vivants et des Morts (). However, he remained apart from the major collaborationist groups such as Rex which he left in 1941. He was friends with the cartoonist Georges Remi (Herg√©) and the writer Henry Bauchau. In 1943 he attempted to distance himself and Le Soir from German control and adopt a stance that was more sympathetic to the Western Allies. However, he was removed from the post on 4 October 1943 and placed under house arrest by the German authorities in the Austrian Alps. He was detained after the Liberation of Belgium and sentanced to death by the Conseil de Guerre for collaboration as part of the √©puration l√©gale in 1946. The sentence was soon commuted to life imprisonment and later to 18 years imprisonment. He was released in 1951 and effectively exiled from Belgium. He became interested in Jungian psychoanalysis, Homosexuality, and Oriental religions and wrote on these subject in the post-war years. He was also an \\"active\\" pederast. He lived in Lausanne, Switzerland and Paris, France. He died at Versailles, near Paris, on 18 April 1969.

A long period of inactivity ended in 1994, when the Circle Jerks, with the 1984-1990 lineup, reunited and signed a major label deal with Mercury Records, a move that had a few business complications: Hetson was still with Bad Religion, who had signed a long-term contract with Atlantic Records, while Schloss had been part of a band contracted to Interscope. After ironing out these difficulties, the band recorded Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities and released it in the summer of 1995, but broke up once again. Reasons for this breakup were essentially the same as they were in 1990. A second Circle Jerks reunion occurred in 2001. Participating this time were Morris, Hetson, Schloss and Kevin Fitzgerald, who filled in on drums for Clark, who at that time had retired from the music business. Tensions among its members and failed attempts to record the follow-up to Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities resulted in the Circle Jerks breaking up yet again in 2011. The band announced in November 2019 that they would reunite in 2020 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Group Sex with live shows.

The revolt broke out in part because of King Gojong's support for reform and modernization. The revolt was also in part, a reaction to Gojong's support for Japanese military advisors.Pratt, Keith L. et al. (1999). \\"Imo Incident\\" in Some sources credit rumors as the spark which ignited violence where many Korean soldiers were worried by the prospect of incorporating Japanese officers in a new army structure. The trigger for the riot is largely attributed to a reaction about unpaid soldiers wages, who found sand and bad rice in soldiers' rations. At the time, soldiers could be paid in rice as it was used in place of currency. The rioters killed many government officials, destroyed homes of high government ministers and occupied the Changdeokgung. They also turned on the members of the Japanese legation in the city, who barely escaped with the help of the British ship HMS Flying Fish.Iwao, Seiichi. (2002). \\"Saimoppo j≈çyaku\\" in During the day of rioting, a number of Japanese were killed, including Horimoto Reijo. The rioters also soldiers attacked the home of Min Gyeom-ho who held joint appointments of Minister of Military Affairs and the high-level official of the Agency to Bestow Blessings. They also lynched lord Heungin, Yi Choe-eung and attempted to murder Queen Min even reaching the Royal Palace. The poverty-stricken people of Seoul from Wangsim-li and Itaewon joined in the riot and Queen Min escaped to the home of Min Eung-sik by disguising herself as a lady of the court. Some explain the flare-up of violence by pointing to provocative policies and conduct by Japanese military advisors who had been training the new Special Skills Force since 1881.Tsuru, Shigeto. (2000). Background Even before the nineteenth century, Korea pursued a strict policy of isolation. Except for official tributary missions to China and the occasional diplomatic mission to Japan, which after the mid-eighteenth century became fewer and confined to the island of Tsushima, Koreans were prohibited from leaving the country. All foreigners were barred entry into the country except for official Chinese on diplomatic missions, and the Japanese who were only allowed to trade at a small walled compound, the Waegwan, in Pusan. Foreign trade was mainly limited to China, conducted at designated locations along the Korean-Manchurian border and with Japan in Pusan. =Korean Politics= In January 1864, King Cheoljong died without a male heir and King Gojong ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, King Gojong was too young and the new king's father, Yi Ha-≈≠ng, became the Daewongun or Lord of the Great Court who ruled Korea in his son's name. Originally the term Daewongun referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. With his ascendancy to power the Daewongun initiated a set of reforms designed to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the yangban class, he also pursued an isolationist policy and was determined to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. In Korean history, the king's in-laws enjoyed great power and the Daewongun acknowledged that any future sons-in-law might threaten his authority. Therefore, he attempted to prevent any possible threat to his rule by selecting as a new queen for his son, an orphaned girl from among the Y≈èh≈≠ng Min clan, a clan which lacked powerful political connections. With Queen Min as his daughter- in-law and the royal consort, the Daewongun felt secure in his power. However, after she had become queen, Min recruited all her relatives and had them appointed to influential positions in the name of the king. The Queen also allied herself with the Daewongun's political enemies, so that by late 1873 she had mobilized enough influence to oust the Daewongun from power. In October 1873, when the Confucian scholar Choe Ik-hyeon submitted a memorial to King Gojong urging him to rule in his own right, Queen Min seized the opportunity to force her father-in-law's retirement as regent. The departure of the Daewongun led to Korea's abandonment of its isolationist policy. Subsequently, the treaty of Ganghwa in 1876 had led to the opening of Korea. =Implementation of the enlightenment policy= The Korean government immediately after the opening of the country to the outside world, pursued a policy of enlightenment aimed at achieving national prosperity and military strength through the doctrine of tongdo s≈ègi, or Eastern ways and Western machines. To modernize their country, the Koreans tried selectively to accept and master Western technology while preserving their country's cultural values and heritage. After the Treaty of Ganghwa was signed, the court dispatched Kim Ki-su, a respected scholar and official to head a mission to Japan. Although Korean kings had sent emissaries to Japan in the past, this was the first such mission since 1810. Kim met a number of officials who showed him some of Japan's reforms and he reluctantly meet with the Japanese emperor. However, Kim left Japan without its modernization and reforms leaving much of an impression on him, and rather than using the trip as an opportunity to introduce Korea to the rapidly changing world as demonstrated by Japanese reform efforts, the mission was treated as one of the occasional missions sent to Japan in the interests of \\"kyorin\\" (neighborly relations). Kim Ki-su did present the King with the journal of his observations, titled Iltong kiyu (Record of a Journey to Japan) It was another four years before the King sent another mission, in 1880. The mission was headed by Kim Hong-jip, who was a more enthusiastic observer of the reforms taking place in Japan. While in Japan, the Chinese diplomat Huang Zunxian presented him with a study called Chaoxian Celue (A Strategy for Korea). It warned of the threat to Korea posed by the Russians and recommended that Korea maintain friendly relations with Japan, which was at the time too economically weak to be an immediate threat, to work closely with China, and seek an alliance with the United States as a counterweight to Russia. After returning to Korea, Kim presented the document to King Gojong, who was so impressed with the document that he had copies made and distributed to his officials. Many conservatives were outraged by the proposal to seek alliance with Western barbarians or even to maintain friendly relations with Japan. Some even plotted a coup, the King responded by executing one prominent official and banishing others. The document became the basis of Korean foreign policy. In January 1881, the government launched administrative reforms and established the T'ongni kimu amun(Office for Extraordinary State Affairs) which was modeled on Chinese administrative structures. Under this overarching organization were 12 sa or agencies, dealing with relations with China (Sadae), diplomatic matters involving other foreign nations (Kyorin), military affairs (Kunmu), border administration (Py≈ènj≈èng), foreign trade (T'ongsang), military ordnance (Kunmul), machinery production (Kigye), shipbuilding (S≈ènham), coastal surveillance (Kiy≈èn), personnel recruitment (Ch≈èns≈èn), special procurement (Iyong), and foreign- language schooling (≈éhak). In May 1881, until their return home in September of that year, a technical mission was sent to Japan to survey its modernized facilities. They traveled all over Japan inspecting administrative, military, educational, and industrial facilities. In October, another small group went to Tianjin to study modern weapons manufacturing, and Chinese technicians were invited to manufacture weapons in Seoul. In July 1883, another fact-finding diplomatic mission toured the United States, meeting with American government leaders, including President Chester A. Arthur, and observing the urban and industrial development of the United States. =Japanese insecurities over Korea= During the 1880s, discussions about Japanese national security focused on the issue of Korean reform. The discourse over the two were interlinked, as the German military adviser Major Jacob Meckel stated, Korea was a \\"dagger pointed at the heart of Japan\\". What made Korea of strategic concern was not merely its proximity to Japan but its inability to defend itself against outsiders. If Korea were truly independent, it posed no strategic problem to Japan's national security but if the country remained backward and uncivilized it would remain weak and consequently would be inviting prey for foreign domination. The political consensus in Japan was that Korean independence lay, as it had been for Meiji Japan, through the importation of \\"civilization\\" from the West. Korea required a program of self- strengthening like the post-Restoration reforms enacted in Japan. The Japanese interest in the reform of Korea was not purely altruistic. Not only would these reforms enable Korea to resist foreign intrusion, which was in Japan's direct interest, but in being a conduit of change, they would also have opportunity to play a larger role on the peninsula. To Meiji leaders, the issue was not whether Korea should be reformed but how reform might be accomplished. There was a choice of adopting a passive role requiring the cultivation of reformist elements within Korea and rendering them assistance whenever possible, or adopting a more aggressive policy, actively interfering in Korean politics to assure that reform took place. Many advocates of reform in Japan, swung between these two positions. Japan in the early 1880s was weak, as a result of internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions during the previous decade, the country was also struggling financially with inflation as a result of these internal factors. Subsequently, the Meiji government adopted a passive policy, encouraging the Korea court to follow the Japanese model but offering little concrete assistance except for the dispatch of the small military mission headed by Lieutenant Horimoto Reizo to train the Py≈èlgigun. What worried the Japanese was the activities of the Chinese, who appeared to be thwarting the fragile group of reformers in Korea. The Qing government, had loosened its hold over Korea in 1876, when the Japanese succeeded in establishing a legal basis for Korean independence. However, Li Hongzhang and many other Chinese high officials were alarmed by the Japanese annexation of the Ryukyu kingdom, from their perspective what had happened to this former tributary state could happen to another as well. =Shufeldt treaty= After 1879, China's relations with Korea came under the authority of Li Hongzhang, who had emerged as one of the most influential figures in China after playing an important role during the Taiping Rebellion, and an advocate of the self-strengthening movement. In 1879, Li was appointed as governor- general of Zhili Province and the imperial commissioner for the northern ports. He was in charge of China's Korea policy and urged Korean officials to adopt China's own self-strengthening program to strengthen their country in response of foreign threats, to which King Gojong was receptive. The Chinese were wary of the Japanese intentions and sought to thwart Japanese influence on the peninsula after the conclusion of the Gangwha Treaty. The United States provided a possible solution: Li concluded that if he encouraged Korea to enter into treaty talks with the Americans, China could use the United States to offset Japan's growing influence. The Americans had shown an interest in entering into treaty negotiations with the Koreans and had dispatched Commodore Robert Shufeldt to East Asia waters. Shufeldt had first visited Japanese officials in 1880, to see if they would mediate between American officials and the Koreans, but the Japanese did not respond to his offer. In 1880, following Chinese advice, King Gojong decided to establish diplomatic ties with the United States, which was a break with tradition. Shufeldt then traveled to Tianjin, where he met with Li Hongzhang, who negotiated on behalf of the Koreans at the talks. After negotiations through Chinese mediation (1881‚Äì1882), the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation was formally signed between the United States and Korea in Incheon on May 22, 1882. The 14-article document provided for the protection of shipwrecked sailors, coal supplies for American vessels entering Korea, trading rights in selected Korean ports, the exchange of diplomatic representatives, granted the Americans extraterritoriality rights and most-favored-nation status in Korea. In return, the United States agreed not to import opium or arms into the country, Korean tariffs were kept high, extraterritoriality was made provisional upon the reform of Korean laws and judicial procedures to conform to America's, and there was no mention of permitting missionary activity. However, two significant issues were raised by the treaty, the first concerned Korea's status as an independent nation. During the talks with the Americans, Li Hongzhang insisted that the treaty contain an article declaring that Korea was a dependency of China and argued that the country had long been a tributary state of China. But Shufeldt firmly opposed such an article, arguing that an American treaty with Korea should be based on the Treaty of Ganghwa, which stipulated that Korea was an independent state. A compromise was finally reached, with Shufeldt and Li agreeing that the King of Korea would notify the U.S president in a letter that Korea had special status as a tributary state of China. The treaty between Korean government and the United States became the model for all treaties between it and other Western countries. Korea, later signed similar trade and commerce treaties with Great Britain and Germany in 1883, with Italy and Russia in 1884, and with France in 1886. Subsequently, commercial treaties were concluded with other European countries. =Establishment of the Py≈èlgigun= In 1881 as part of their plan to modernize Korea, King Gojong and his consort Queen Min had invited the Japanese military attach√© Lieutenant Horimoto Reiz≈ç to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army. Eighty to one hundred young men of the aristocracy were to be given Japanese military training and a formation called the Py≈èlgigun (Special Skills Force) was established. In January 1882, the government also reorganized the existing five-army garrison structure into the Muwiy≈èng (Palace Guards Garrison) and the Chang≈èy≈èng (Capital Guards Garrison). However, there was resentment towards the Py≈èlgigun on the part of the soldiers of the regular army who were envious of the formation as it was much better equipped and treated than they were. Additionally, more than 1000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army, most of them were either old or disabled and the rest had not been given their pay in rice for thirteen months. In June, King Gojong having been informed of the situation, ordered that a month's allowance of rice be given to the soldiers. He directed Min Gyeom-ho, the overseer of government finances and the Queen Min's nephew, to handle the matter. Min, in turn, handed the matter over to his steward who sold the good rice he had been given and used the money to buy millet that he mixed with sand and bran. As a result, the rice became so rotten and foul smelling as being inedible. Events of the incidentInitial riot= The distribution of the alleged rice infuriated the soldiers. In July 23, 1882, the riot broke out in Uigeumbu. The enraged soldiers then headed for the residence of Min Gyeom-ho, whom they had suspected of having swindled them out of their rice. Min on hearing word of the revolt, ordered the police to arrest some of the ringleaders and announced that they would be executed the next morning. Min Gyeom-ho assumed that this would serve as a warning to the others. However, after learning what had transpired, the rioters broke into Min's house to take vengeance, as he was not at his residence the rioters vented their frustrations by destroying his furniture and other possessions. The rioters then moved on to an armory from which they stole weapons and ammunition, they were now better armed than ever before in their careers as soldiers. The rioters then headed for the prison and after overpowering the guards, they released not only the men who had been arrested that day by Min Gyeom-ho but also but many political prisoners as well. Min, who was in the royal palace, now summoned the army to quell the rebellion but it had become too late to suppress the mutiny. The original body of rioters had been swelled by the poor of the city and other malcontents and as a result, the revolt had assumed major proportions. =Flight of the Japanese legation= \\"The Korean Uprising of 1882\\" -- woodblock print by Toyohara Chikanobu, 1882. The rioters now turned their attention to the Japanese. One group of rioters headed to Lieutenant Horimoto's quarters and took turns in stabbing the military instructor, administering many small wounds until they slowly killed him. Another group, some 3,000 strong, armed themselves with weapons taken from a looted depot and headed for the Japanese legation. Inside the legation was the minister to Korea, Hanabusa Yoshitada, seventeen members of his staff and ten legation police officers. The mob surrounded the legation shouting its intention of killing all the Japanese inside. Hanabusa gave orders to burn the legation and important documents were set on fire. The flames quickly spread, and under cover of the flames and smoke, members of the legation escaped through a rear gate. The Japanese fled to the harbor where they boarded a boat which took them down the Han River to Incheon. At first they took refuge with the Incheon commandant but when word arrived of the events in Seoul, the attitude of their hosts changed and the Japanese realized they were no longer safe. They escaped to the harbor during rain and were pursued by Korean soldiers. Six Japanese were killed, while another five were seriously wounded. The survivors carrying the wounded, then boarded a small boat and headed for the open sea where three days later they were rescued by a British surveyor ship, . =Attack on the royal palace= Ukiyo-e depicting the flight of the Japanese legation in 1882. The day after the attack on the Japanese legation, on July 24, the rioters forced their way into the royal palace where they found and killed Min Gyeom-ho, as well as a dozen other high-ranking officers including Heungin-gun Yi Choe-Heung, the older brother of the Daewongun, who was previously critical of Korea's isolation policy. They also searched for Queen Min intending to kill her because of her membership to the hated Min family, and as a result of the perceived the corruption in the government which was completely under her control. The queen narrowly escaped, however, dressed as an ordinary lady of the court and was carried on the back of a faithful guard who claimed she was his sister. She found refuge in the home of Min Eung-sik in Chungju, Chungcheong Province. Aftermath In the midst of the chaos, the regent father of the king, the Heungseon Daewongun, who had supported soldiers' complaints, took power and tried to re-establish order. The Japanese government sent Ambassador Hanabusa back to Seoul with four naval warships, three cargo ships and a battalion of armed soldiers. =Japanese response= There was significant indignation in Japan at the treatment of its nationals and the events were seen as an affront to the reputation of the Japanese nation. The foreign office under Inoue Kaoru commanded Hanabusa to return to Seoul and meet with senior Korean officials and to persuade them to set a date by which the rioters would be brought to justice in a manner which was satisfactory to the Japanese government. If the rioters were to make surprise attacks on the Japanese, they would then be compelled to use military force to against them, regardless of what measures the Korean government might have taken. Hanabusa was instructed that if the Koreans showed any signs of hiding the perpetrators and not punishing them or if they refused to take part in any discussions with the Japanese, this would constitute a clear breach of peace. In that case, a final letter would be sent to the Korean government by an envoy, indicting it for its crimes and then Japanese forces would occupy the port of Chempulpo and await further orders. Hanabusa was advised that if China or any other nation offered to mediate, it should be refused. The instructions, however, concluded on a conciliatory note, in that the Japanese government did not consider that the Korean government had intentionally harmed peaceful relations and there should a sincere attempt to restore the traditional good relations between the two countries. The incident could even provide a means of securing a lasting peace and in view of Korean national feelings, the Japanese had judged that it was premature to send a punitive expedition. The minister Hanabusa would only return to Seoul and be protected by army and navy troops, because of the concern that there was no predicting what further violence might be unleashed by the rioters. Nevertheless, despite optimism of a peaceful resolution to the crisis, the Japanese government authorized the call-up of reserves in the beginning of August. Inoue Kaoru also notified western ministers in Tokyo of the government's decision to send troops and warships to Korea to protect Japanese citizens. He emphasized that the government's intentions were entirely peaceful, however, an offer by the American government to mediate was immediately declined. The emperor, worried about the situation in Korea, dispatched Chamberlain Yamaguchi Masasada to the country as a personal envoy. He remained there until the Treaty of Chemulpo was signed. =Chinese response= The Chinese received word about the rebellion through Li Shuchang, the Chinese minister in Tokyo in Japan. On August 1, as China did not have a legation in Korea at the time, Zhang Shuosheng dispatched ships of Beiyang Fleet under the command of Ding Ruchang to Korea with Ma Jianzhong on board to assess the status of the rebellion. About 4,500 troops, under General Wu Changqing arrived in Korea. The Chinese troops effectively regained control and quelled the rebellion and were then stationed at various points throughout Seoul. In the aftermath of rebellion, the Daewongun was accused of fomenting the rebellion and its violence, and was arrested by Chinese troops. On September 25, three high ranking Chinese naval officers paid a courtesy call on the Daewongun and as they were leaving they asked him to attend an important meeting at their residence in the city. The Daewongun was obliged by rules of etiquette to return the call and went to the Chinese encampment the next day, as requested. Initially, there were the usual exchanges of politenesses between the two parties but at a signal, Chinese troops burst into the room seized the Daewongun and put him into a palanquin. He was carried off to the warship Weiyuan and while still inside the palanquin, was taken to China. He was not released from the palanquin until the Weiyuan reached Tianjin. In Tianjian, he was interrogated by Li Hung- chang, who unsuccessfully tried to make him admit responsibility for the events surrounding the uprising. Li ordered the Daewongun put back in his palanquin and he was carried off to a town about sixty miles southwest of Beijing, where for three years he was confined to one room and kept under strict surveillance. Consequences After the Imo Incident, early reform efforts in Korea suffered a major setback. The aftermath of the event also brought the Chinese into the country where they began to directly interfere in Korean internal affairs. =Reassertion of Chinese influence= After the incident, China reasserted its suzerainty over Korea and stationed troops in Seoul, commanded by Wu Changqing. The Chinese undertook several initiatives to gain significant influence over the Korean government. As well as stationing troops in Korea, two special advisers on foreign affairs representing Chinese interests were dispatched in Korea; the German Paul Georg von M√∂llendorff, who was a close confidant of Li Hongzhang, and the Chinese diplomat Ma Jianzhong. Wu Changqing, together with a staff of officers, took over the training of the Korean army and additionally provided the Koreans with 1,000 rifles, two cannons and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the Ch'in'guny≈èng, (Capital Guards Command) was also created consisting of four barracks designated the right, left, front, and rear; this new Korean military formation was trained along Chinese lines by Yuan Shikai. The Chinese further supervised the creation of a Korean Maritime Customs Service in 1883, with von M√∂ellendorff as its head. Korea was again reduced to a tributary state of China with King Gojong unable to appoint diplomats without Chinese approval and troops stationed in Seoul in order to protect Chinese interests in the country. The Chinese government began to turn its former tributary state into a semi-colony and its policy toward Korea substantially changed to a new imperialistic one where the suzerain state demanded certain privileges in her vassal state. In October 1882, the two countries signed a treaty stipulating that Korea was a dependency of China and granted Chinese merchants the right to conduct overland and maritime business freely within Korean borders. It also gave them substantial advantages over the Japanese and Westerners and also granted the Chinese unilateral extraterritoriality privileges in civil and criminal cases. Under the treaty the number of Chinese merchants and traders greatly increased, striking a severe blow to Korean merchants. Although it allowed Koreans reciprocally to trade in Beijing the agreement was not a treaty but was in effect issued as a regulation for a vassal, it also reasserted Korea's dependency on China. =Japanese military buildup= The crisis in Korea persuaded top civilian leaders in Japan that it was undesirable to postpone expenditure on a larger military. During the 1870s, the Japanese government was faced with internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions, which had led to rampant inflation and financial difficulties. Consequently, the government had decided in late 1880 to stabilize the currency by increased taxation and financial retrenchment. However, the Imo mutiny had underscored the urgency of military expansion, as Japan's limited military and naval power was made apparent. In contrast to the Chinese who had quickly dispatched an expeditionary force to Seoul, where they quickly established order and controlled the situation with their military superiority over the rioters, the Japanese had been forced to pursue a reactive or passive policy. To many in the country, including Yamagata Aritomo, the lesson was clear ‚Äî that a conscript army of forty thousand men was no longer adequate to Japan's needs and neither was a navy lacking transport ships to dispatch troops abroad: were hostilities to break out with Korea or China, the country would be in a serious predicament. In September 1882, Iwakura Tomomi had also informed the Daj≈çkan that increased naval strength was essential for a maritime country like Japan. If Japan went to war, it would not have enough vessels to protect the home islands and if it used its fleet to protect the home islands it would not be able to mount an attack overseas. As the Chinese were building up their naval forces, and Japan would be unable to defend itself against China in a possible future conflict. Iwakura argued that it was of the utmost urgency to spend more on the navy even if this meant raising taxes. Even Finance Minister Matsukata Masayoshi, who had implemented the fiscal retrenchment policy, agreed that financial resources had to be found for a military and naval buildup if the international situation required. Spurred on by anxieties over China, Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s. In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures, in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent. In 1883, plans called for a substantial expansion of the Imperial Japanese Army with twenty-eight infantry regiments, including four imperial guard regiments; seven cavalry battalions; seven field artillery battalions, each consisting of two field-gun battalions and one mountain-gun battalion; seven engineer battalions; and seven transport battalions. The proposed composition of forces with increased cavalry, engineer and transport units was intended to reorganize the army as a force capable of fighting on the continent. The Imperial Japanese Navy also developed its own plans with the expansion of the fleet to forty-two vessels, thirty-two of which would have to be newly constructed. Within the next two years, twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction. NotesReferencesBibliography * * Iwao, Seiichi. (2002).

In 1958, Fox led a National Museum team in conducting extensive excavations on two sites at Calatagan, Batangas, in what may be considered the first systematic excavation involving the National Museum in the country. His report, published in 1959, was based on artifacts and information derived from 505 graves in two sites known as Kay Tomas and Pulong Bakaw. In the 1960s, by then the head of the Anthropology Division of the National Museum of the Philippines, he led a six-year archaeological research project in Palawan, focusing mainly on the caves and rockshelters of Lipuun Point in the southern part of the island (Fox 1970). Its most outstanding site is the Tabon Cave complex, the large main cave delivered the only Pleistocene human fossils found in the Philippines to date. The fossil finds include a skullcap, jaw bones, teeth and several other fragmented bones. Dubbed as the \\"Tabon Man\\", the finds represent more than just one individual. Their age has been determined using radiometric dating, giving dates between 16500 ¬±2000 B.P for the skull cap and 48,000 ¬±11,000 B.P. for a tibia fragment., citing Fox, 1970. Fox actively served the National Museum of the Philippines from 1948 to 1975. In 1975, while serving as consultant to the Philippine President on anthropological matters and as Dean of Brent School in Baguio, Philippines, he suffered a stroke which impaired his speech and right arm, preventing him from pursuing his teaching and research work. Subsequent strokes left him confined to home until his death in 1985.

It is part of the New Zealand Police, and there are SIG teams centered in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.  History  Funding for the group was announced in 2004 and the group was formed in 2005. The formation of a central Strategic Intelligence Unit was approved by the New Zealand government as early as January 2002. The group was formed 'to focus on terrorism threats to national security' in response to September 11 terrorist attacks. SIG appears to be operated by New Zealand police in connection with the New Zealand Defence Force, Security Intelligence Service (SIS) and Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB). The group reportedly has teams in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. An intelligence unit and a special tactics group was formed by police in 2002 to look into terrorism, at the same time as the SIS budget increased markedly and when Jon White was made Assistant Commissioner of Counter Terrorism.Police Terror Boss has Activist Harassment History, Scoop, Joseph Barratt, 26 October 2008, retrieved 30 December 2008.  Controversy  The subsequent activities of the group have been controversial, following the revelation in December 2008 that Christchurch man Rob Gilchrist had been spying for SIG officers on individuals and organisations including Greenpeace, Iraq war protestors, student associations, animal rights and climate change campaigners. News that SIG existed first emerged in public media in December 2008, when it was reported that an exposed SIG spy had spied on political parties and organisations involved in peaceful, environmental, animal and human rights activities. Subsequent articles reported that SIG had been receiving information on a variety of organisations including unions, contrary to a prior claim that only individuals were targeted. Officers involved in the group include Detective Peter Gilroy and Detective Senior Sergeant John Sjoberg, both named in connection with the Gilchrist incident. The Sunday Star Times reported, at the time the Gilchrist scandal broke, that Detective Peter Gilroy 'moved to New Zealand in 1973 from the London Metropolitan Police and was a member of the Armed Offenders Squad and then Special Tactics Group from 1975‚Äì1999, when he appears to have moved into police intelligence work'. Within days of details covering SIG activities being released into mainstream media in December 2008, New Zealanders began calling for a commission of enquiry into the group.Call for commission of enquiry, NewstalkZB, 21 December 2008, retrieved 30 December 2008. SIG has been criticised for spying on peaceful protest and community organisations, wasting resources, and using \\"Stasi tactics and covert political operations that undermine democracy\\" (Keith Locke, Green Party police spokesperson). The group has also been criticised for \\"dangling money, public money, in front of protest group members, such as Gilchrist, in an attempt to [turn] them into spies\\" (Alan Liefting, Coalition spokesperson), and for having \\"gone well outside its mandate\\" (Andrew Little, EPMU president).

Background  Wang Shizhen was born in 759.

Wang Shizhen had at least three younger brothers, Wang Shiqing (), Wang Shiping (), and Wang Shize ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 142.  Service under Li Baochen and Li Weiyue  It was said that Wang Shizhen became a fierce soldier in his youth and was capable in strategies. He became a guard commander for Li Baochen, and Li Baochen gave him a daughter in marriage. Wang Shizhen carefully cultivated his relationships with Li Baochen's close associates. Late in Li Baochen's life, he wanted to pass his position to his son Li Weiyue, but feared that Li Weiyue was weak in personality and could not control the officers, and therefore began killing the more capable officers. However, due to the marriage relationship and Wang Shizhen's carefulness in befriending Li Baochen's close associates, Wang Wujun was able to escape this fate.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226.

Thereafter, Li Weiyue and the rulers of three other allied circuits ‚Äî Li Na, whom Emperor Dezong similarly refused to allow to inherit his father Li Zhengji's position as military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) when Li Zhengji died in 781 as well; Tian Yue the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei); and Liang Chongyi the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) prepared for war against the imperial government. Liang was quickly defeated by Li Xilie and committed suicide, while imperial forces inflicted serious damage on Tian's and Li Na's forces. Meanwhile, Zhu Tao the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) attacked Li Weiyue from the north and was quickly able to persuade two key Chengde officers, Zhang Xiaozhong the prefect of Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang) and Kang Rizhi () the prefect of Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang), to submit their respective prefectures turn against Li Weiyue. When Li Weiyue tried to counterattack in spring 782, Zhu and Zhang's joint forces defeated him at Shulu (ÊùüÈπø, in modern Shijiazhuang), forcing him to flee back to Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture. It was said that during the Battle of Shulu, Wang Wujun, serving as Li Weiyue's forward commander and believing that Li Weiyue was already suspicious of him, decided not to fight to the best of his ability, and that this led to the defeat.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. After the defeat, Li Weiyue was even more suspicious of Wang, but his advisors pointed out that there was no one other than Wang who would be capable to command the army. Li Weiyue thus commissioned Wang, assisted by Wei Changning (), to attack Zhao Prefecture, and put Wang Shizhen in charge of security at headquarters. Wang Wujun was relieved to get to leave Heng Prefecture, and once he exited the city, initially wanted to flee to Zhang. Wei pointed out that Emperor Dezong had issued an edict promising to give the offices that Li Weiyue wanted to whoever would cut off Li Weiyue's head and advocated for an attack on Li Weiyue. Wang Wujun thus notified Wang Shizhen and involved Li Weiyue's close associate Xie Zun () in the plot at well. He made a surprise attack against Heng Prefecture, and Wang Shizhen and Xie opened the city gates to welcome him. Wang Shizhen also captured Li Weiyue and delivered him to Wang Wujun. Wang Wujun killed Li Weiyue and his associates and surrendered to the imperial government.  Service under Wang Wujun  Emperor Dezong, in the aftermaths, divided Chengde's seven prefectures into three smaller circuits ‚Äî with Zhang Xiaozhong receiving three prefectures and the title of military governor of the newly created Yidingcang Circuit (ÊòìÂÆöÊªÑ, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei, later renamed Yiwu Circuit (), while Wang Wujun and Kang Rizhi received two prefectures each with lesser titles of military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi), of Hengji () and Shenzhao (Ê∑±Ë∂ô, both headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang). This displeased both Zhu Tao and Wang ‚Äî as Zhu had wanted Emperor Dezong to give him Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), which went to Kang instead (Emperor Dezong gave Zhu two prefectures on paper, De (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong), both then still held by Li Na, and Wang believed that Emperor Dezong had reneged on the promise to reward him with the positions that Li Weiyue had wanted. He was further fearful when he received orders to provide Zhu's army with food and Ma Sui's army (which was then attacking Tian Yue) with horses, believing that Emperor Dezong might be using those orders to divert his power and getting ready to attack him next. Tian, hearing of Zhu's disaffection, sent emissaries to Zhu to persuade him to turn against the imperial forces and aid him. Zhu agreed, and in turn sent emissaries to Wang, persuading him to join the alliance as well and agreeing to give him Shen Prefecture, which Zhu occupied at the time. Wang was pleased, and agreed to join him and Tian. Subsequently, with Tian in desperate straits, Zhu and Wang Wujun advanced south and dealt a severe blow to the imperial forces, forcing them to lift the siege on Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (). Meanwhile, the imperial general Li Sheng took this opportunity to attack north and joined forces with Zhang, forcing Wang Shizhen, who was then sieging Kang at Zhao Prefecture, to lift the siege on Zhao Prefecture and withdraw back to Heng Prefecture. Meanwhile, in the aftermaths of the imperial forces' defeat, Tian was grateful to Zhu, and offered to subjugate himself and Wang Wujun to Zhu ‚Äî in effect, offering the emperor title to Zhu. Zhu declined, crediting Wang rather than himself for the victory. At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian () and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's era name in order not to completely break from Tang. On December 9, 782,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%AB%D8%A4%A4&yy;=3&ycanzi;=&mm;=11‚ÖÜ=1&dcanzi;= in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi. They also established administrations with governmental structures paralleling the Tang imperial government to further show independence, although the titles were intentionally different than Tang's to show some subordination. After Wang Wujun claimed royal title, he bestowed the titles of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and supreme commander of the armed forces on Wang Shizhen and left him in charge of the capital Zhending (ÁúüÂÆö, i.e., Heng Prefecture). Not much is known about Wang Shizhen's activities during the subsequent years of wars, although it is known that after Wang Wujun, Li Na, and Tian Yue removed their own imperial titles and resubmitted to Emperor Dezong's rule in 784, Wang Wujun made him the deputy military governor, and Emperor Dezong also created Wang Shizhen the Prince of Qinghe. In 790, when Zhao Gao () the prefect of Di Prefecture (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) rebelled against Wang Wujun and surrendered to Li Na, it was Wang Shizhen that Wang Wujun sent to attack Zhao, but Wang Shizhen was unable to recapture Di Prefecture. Only after Emperor Dezong intervened and ordered the two circuits and Weibo Circuit (which was also involved) to make peace with each other did Li Na return Di Prefecture to Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. After Wang Wujun died in 801, Emperor Dezong made Wang Shizhen military governor to succeed his father.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236.  As military governor  It was said that Wang Shizhen, while serving his father in the campaigns, suffered much difficulty, and that after he became military governor, he was interested in being restful and peaceful. Like his father and the other de facto independent military governors, he refused to submit taxes to the imperial government and refused to allow the imperial government to commission Chengde officials, but, in contrast with Weibo and Lulong, he often submitted tributes. In 806, by which time Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong was emperor, Emperor Xianzong bestowed on Wang Shizhen the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. In 807, there was a dispute between Wang, Liu Ji the military governor of Lulong Circuit, and Zhang Maozhao (ÂºµËåÇÊò≠, Zhang Xiaozhong's son) the military governor of Yiwu Circuit that caused them to submit accusations against each other. Emperor Xianzhong sent the official Fang Shi () to mediate a peace between them. Wang Shizhen died in 809, and was given posthumous honors.New Book of Tang, vol. 211. Emperor Xianzong initially did not allow his oldest son Wang Chengzong to inherit the position, but eventually did.

He was the State Director for the Barack Obama campaign in Florida, managing Obama's 2008 effort in the state, and served as a Florida Senior Advisor in 2012. Born in Kankakee, Illinois, Schale is a graduate of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, where he received degrees in political science and history. He got his political start in 1996, managing the state house campaign of Doug Wiles of St. Augustine. Wiles, who for several terms represented the most Republican seat held by a Democrat, went on to become the Minority Leader of the state house in Florida, where Schale joined him as his communications director. In 2005, Schale left the legislature to take over the political operations of the State House Democratic Caucus, where under his leadership and working with former state senator Dan Gelber, the Democrats had their best two-year election cycle in history, picking up nine districts previously held by Republicans, for which Schale was called the \\"newest star of the Florida Democratic Party\\" by the St. Petersburg Times, and \\"Wunderkind\\" by the National Journal. In June 2008, Schale was hired by Obama for America to run the Tampa-based Florida operation, helping Senator Obama become the first non- incumbent Democrat to win Florida since President Jimmy Carter's win in 1976, leading an effort that the Miami Herald said will \\"change the way politics is practiced in Florida.\\" In winning Florida, Obama carried most of the critical swing counties in central Florida and registered hundreds of thousands of new voters. Today, Schale is considered one of the top strategists in either party in Florida. Following the two Obama campaigns, Schale returned to Tallahassee, where he married Nikole Souder-Schale, a regional vice president with the American Heart Association. In Florida, he advised Alex Sink's campaign for governor in 2010, as well as Gwen Graham's successful Congressional campaign in 2014. In 2015, he helped the operations of Draft Biden, the Super PAC supporting a potential presidential bid by Obama's vice president, Joe Biden. Today, he runs his own company, advising companies such as Walt Disney World and AT&T; on Florida, as well as working with a number of candidates. In 2014, Schale won the KIE NASCAR league Championship which is often displayed behind him when he appears on television.

The fire began at the rear wall of the local flour and feed store, and spread through the community's wooden structures leading to the destruction of 18 buildings. The fire resulted in changes in local construction practices to stop the likelihood and rapid spread of future fires including an increased reliance on sandstone for new structures, which resulted in the Town's early nickname \\"Sandstone City\\". Background The Town of Calgary was officially incorporated exactly two years earlier on November 7, 1884 under Northwest Territories Ordinance. The municipal government was in disorder following the events of the January 1886 Calgary municipal election which saw incumbent Mayor George Murdoch decisively win the election which was overturned by Stipendiary Magistrate Jeremiah Travis for elector list fraud and appointed James Reilly as mayor and replaced two other members of council. Neither faction was capable of governing the town, which led to the newly ordered chemical engine for the recently organized Calgary Fire Department (Calgary Hook, Ladder and Bucket Corps) to be held in the Canadian Pacific Railway's storage yard due to lack of payment. Local government would be restored a few days before the fire in the November 3, 1886 municipal election which saw George Clift King elected mayor. Fire and aftermath In the early morning of November 7, 1886, flames at the rear wall of the Parish and Son flour and feed store was reported. The Calgary Hook, Ladder and Bucket Corps sent to battle the fire and broke into the Canadian Pacific Railway's freight shed to retrieve the impounded chemical engine and begin battling the fire. During the course of battling the fire, the Corps determined it was necessary to form a firebreak to prevent further damage, and former mayor George Murdoch agreed and participated in the demolishing of his harness shop. An attempt was made to use gunpowder to blow up Murdoch's store, however the Calgary Weekly Herald noted \\"failed owing to the force of the charge not being sufficiently concentrated\\". The fire was stopped and the extinguished after the break was created. This would be the second time George Murdoch would lose his business to fire, the first occurring in 1871 during Great Chicago Fire. Ultimately, fourteen buildings were destroyed or razed in attempts to control the blaze, including four stores, three warehouses, three hotels, a tinsmith shop and a saloon. Losses were estimated at $103,200; however no one was killed or injured. Authorities suggested arson may have been involved, but no arrests were made. To reduce the potential for future fires, city officials drafted a bylaw requiring all large downtown buildings were to be built with sandstone, which was readily available nearby in the form of Paskapoo sandstone. Following the fire several quarries were opened around the city by prominent local businessmen including Thomas Edworthy, Wesley Fletcher Orr, J. G. McCallum, and William Oliver. Prominent buildings built with Sandstone following the fire include Knox Presbyterian Church (1887), Imperial Bank Building (1887), Calgary City Hall (1911), and Calgary Courthouse No. 2 (1914).

The fully Hungarian owned company develops products ‚Äì under the same brand name: \\"VirusBuster\\" ‚Äì for the Hungarian and international market to protect users' computers from malware programs and various other IT-security threats. In August 2012, VirusBuster Ltd. announced the cancellation of its anti-virus products. [1] After VirusBuster was shut down, the entire developing and malware analyst team joined Sophos.  History  The legal and trade predecessor of the firm began to develop antiviral products at the end of the 1980s. Its software named \\"Virsec\\" came out at the same time, when other well known vendors appeared with their similar solutions. In 1992 Virsec was renamed to \\"VirusBuster\\". At the later official formation of the firm this name became the name of the company as well. In 1997 the official foundation of VirusBuster Ltd took place. In the next years the company produced mainly anti-viral products for the Hungarian market, primarily for the governmental sector. 2000 was the year of the international opening. VirusBuster's products began participating of international test from the summer of this year, and the firm itself began to build up international partnerships also in 2000. Between 2000 and 2003 VirusBuster steadily extended its portfolio. The developments manifested in the increasing number of protected platforms and systems, also in new layered security products to target new threats, and in the management system for the firm's security products. With all of these achievements the company could offer effective security solutions for every organizational customers. 2001 was the first year when an international foreigner company ‚Äì the Australian Leprechaun ‚Äì licensed VirusBuster's antiviral technology to integrate it into its own security products. Between 2003 and 2006 VirusBuster strengthened its Eastern European and worldwide market positions. The antiviral engine of the company became an independent product and thus it was integrated into several other firms' security solutions. These were the years, when VirusBuster appeared on the American market. In August 2012, Agnitum, the PC security expert and manufacturer of the Outpost range of security products, had announced the acquisition of antivirus technology and infrastructure from its long-term partner VirusBuster. In October 2012, the owner of the VirusBuster has made the decision that the products and the services were going to be removed from the market. The entire developing and malware analyst team joined Sophos.  Products  VirusBuster provided customized, multi-level virus protection solutions for all ‚Äì individual, home and all size organizational ‚Äì customer groups, furthermore VirusBuster Internet Security Suite provides full IT- protection for home users. The company's security products cover all important operating systems, including both the workstation and server platforms. According to independent IT-professionals and international test labs the products of company were pretty good solutions, in the aspects of both speed and efficiency. Some security analysts said VirusBuster's user interface is rather too \\"traditional\\", but according to others this almost \\"old fashioned\\" GUI provides better transparency and easier manageability. According to general opinions the products of the company cover all important business platforms and protect from every IT-security threats.  Technology licences  Beside the retail solutions for different market segments it was also important for the company, that their antiviral engine became an independent product. Several international companies were licensing VirusBuster's technology, and integrated it into their own products. (Outpost Security Suite, Kaspersky, Microsoft, Proteatools)  International partnerships  Beside the companies mentioned above, the most important strategic partners of the company in different international collaboration projects were: *Microsoft *HP *Sun Microsystems *Novell  Name misuse  In the beginning of 2008 VirusBuster's security researchers found a computer malware, which was using the name of the company to trick users. The worm was spreading itself as an attachment of infected e-mails under the name \\"virusbuster.personal.v3.20.regfile.by.arcade.exe\\". The analysis and the classification of the virus was not a very difficult task, since the worm was a variant of the well known and rather old \\"Bagle\\" malware family. This was not the first example of name misuse; VirusBurst was a fake antispyware program in 2006. Its name was very similar to VirusBusters' name ‚Äì probably accidentally, but in another case the similarity was perfect: Also in 2008 the 29A virus-writing group announced its shut down, and one of the prominent members of the 29A team also used the 'VirusBuster' alias.

His work in the 1950s led to major advances in nuclear-ship technology and civilian use of nuclear power.Obituary, washingtonpost.com Biography Radkowsky was a native of Elizabeth, New Jersey. He studied electrical engineering at the City College of New York (B.S., 1935), and physics at George Washington University (M.S., 1941; advisor was Dr. Edward TellerObituary, nytimes.com), and at Catholic University (Ph.D. 1947; Thesis: \\"Temperature dependence of electron energy levels in solids\\"https://openlibrary.org/b/OL191982M) He married Annette Eisenberg in 1951. (Daughter, Gilah Chukat. Six grandchildren. Brother, Lawrence Radkowsky.) He moved to Israel in 1972, and lived in Ramat Chen. Radkowsky was an Orthodox Jew, a ◊™◊ú◊û◊ï◊ì ◊ó◊õ◊ù, finished Shas twice, and wrote several articles on miracles and science.See for example \\"Are There Miracles?\\" Radkowsky worked on nuclear reactors at the Argonne National Laboratory, in the 1930s, and also worked for the Singer sewing machine firm. He was a civilian nuclear physicist in the US Navy from 1938 to 1972, where he was chief scientist of the Bureau of Ships' nuclear propulsion division, and in which role he worked closely with Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Radkowsky was also chief scientist in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (now Dept. of Energy), Office of Naval Reactors from 1950 to 1972. He taught nuclear engineering at Tel Aviv University (1972‚Äì1994), and at Ben Gurion University (1994‚Äì2002). In 1979 Radkowsky founded New Power Technology in Israel. It was backed by Tel Aviv University and Ben Gurion University and also by Yitzhak Moda‚Äôi, the Israeli Energy Minister who said, ‚ÄúThe Israeli Government is very pleased with the designation of New Power Technology to assist us in the development of Dr. Radkowsky‚Äôs progressive work in the field of nuclear energy []. This outstanding project would not only benefit Israel but all mankind.‚Äù Feldhamer Capital was appointed by the Israeli Energy Ministry to commercialize New Power Technology following an agreement between the Energy ministry and the Universities of Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion where the research was conducted. The advisory committee and board of directors were a collection of the world‚Äôs most famous Manhattan Project and Nobel Prize winning physicists, all willing to lend their names to this humane venture. Professor Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb and founder of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Nobel Prizewinner Professor Eugene Wigner of Princeton University, Dr. Alvin Radkowsky, Nobel Prizewinner Professor Hans Bethe of Cornell University and Professor Herbert Goldstein of Columbia University all lent their reputations to this venture. The initiative was halted after the 1986 Chernobyl accident put a stop to any interest in new nuclear designs, even though that very accident could never have occurred with the Radkowsky improvement. In 1992, Radkowsky started what became Thorium Power Inc.http://www.ltbridge.com(Nasdaq:LTBR). Thorium fueled reactors allow nations the capability to generate energy while preventing them from using spent fuels to produce nuclear weapons. He repeatedly insisted that continued use of uranium fuel would inevitably lead to nuclear terrorism. Thorium Power participated in the design of the thorium-based fuel to burn plutonium from old nuclear weapons. It is now being tested at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow. The fuel RTF (Radkowsky Thorium Fuel) is named after him.Utilization of Thorium in Light Water Reactors ‚Äì Radkowsky Thorium Fuel (RTF) - with an image of Dr. Radkowsky By 2014, long after the Kurchatov trial was expected to have produced results, none have apparently been published.

The overall purpose of a youth advocate is to ensure that youth maintain their human rights while aiding in skill development in all areas of life such as education, health, housing, employment, relationships, etc. A youth advocate aims to prevent youth from experiencing diminished self-esteem while interacting with adults who hold professional authoritative roles in their life. Examples of these adults are judges, lawyers, teachers, etc.http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/proceedings/09/finlayson.pdf Travis Lloyd, a speaker on the subject, describes a youth advocate as one who plays a significant supportive role in the social and legal processes in the lives of young people, especially homeless and foster youth who lack family support. In consideration of the legal aspects, the National Association of Youth Courts describes a youth advocate as a person who provides support to a youth respondent or defendant during a hearing. A youth advocate additionally, not only ensures that youth maintain their human rights, but also that their perspective and feelings about services or systems are heard. Many youth advocates have previous experiences that are similar to what the youth they are serving are experiencing themselves. This is important because it makes it easier for the youth advocate to empathize with their clients. Often youth going through services or systems (whether it be mental health, juvenile justice, substance use issues, foster care, or homelessness) can be dehumanized, their opinions/feelings/insight ignored, and further traumatized. When a youth advocate (who understands what those situations can feel like) steps into a young persons life, it is often transformational for that youth and can lead them to a path of stability and success.

Caracciolo, a Founder of La Repubblica, Dies at 83\\", The New York Times, December 16, 2008 Biography The oldest of three children, Caracciolo was born in Florence to Filippo Caracciolo, 8th Principe di Castagneto, 3rd Duca di Melito and American heiress Margaret Clarke. He was an older brother to Marella Agnelli, the wife of Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli and half-sibling of film producer Ettore Rosboch von Wolkenstein (whose daughter Bloomberg journalist Elisabetta \\"Lili\\", Carlo's goddaughter, married Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este). At 18, he fought in the Italian resistance in World War II. After the war he attended Harvard Law School and worked for a New York law firm that had as a partner Allen Dulles, future head of the CIA. In the United States he began to show a serious interest in publishing.Carlo Caracciolo: newspaper publisher who set up La Repubblica, The Times, January 8, 2009 In 1951, he moved into publishing in Milan, and in 1955 set up the N.E.R. (Nuove Edizioni Romane) publishing house with the progressive industrialist Adriano Olivetti, manufacturer of Olivetti typewriters. In October 1955 the company founded the news magazine L'Espresso with editors Arrigo Benedetti and Eugenio Scalfari.Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture, CRC Press, 2000, p. 290Encyclopedia of Italian literary studies, CRC Press, 2007, p. 980 Caracciolo was a man of the liberal left. He disdained his aristocratic title, but betrayed it in his elegance of dress and manner. He believed that a modern postwar Italian republic should be run on lay rather than religious principles, and his news outlets campaigned for reform of the laws governing divorce and abortion. L'Espresso was characterized from the beginning by an aggressive investigative journalism strongly focussed on corruption and clientelism by the Christian Democrat party. This made the main shareholder Olivetti unpopular with the ministries and large companies that were the primary customers of his main business. In 1956, with the magazine losing money, Olivetti made Caracciolo a present of the majority shareholding.History , Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso (Retrieved January 30, 2010) In 1976 he and Eugenio Scalfari, with backing from the publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, set up the daily newspaper La Repubblica. Founded in Rome as a national newspaper and published in the novel tabloid size. In 1984, shortly before it began to outsell the prestigious Corriere della Sera, Caracciolo took his publishing activities to the Italian stock exchange. Four years later he sold his holdings in Editoriale L'Espresso to Mondadori. In 1990, however, he was shocked to learn that Mondadori's heirs had sold out to Silvio Berlusconi, whose politics he detested. After much in- fighting and litigation, the news publications were hived off into the Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso controlled by the CIR Group of entrepreneur Carlo De Benedetti, of which Caracciolo remained honorary president until 2006. In 1991, Caracciolo and his wife Violante Visconti purchased the Torrecchia Vecchia estate, and subsequently developed its villa with architect Gae Aulenti, around which they created a notable, English-style garden to designs by Dan Pearson and others. In 2007, a year after he retired from the Espresso Group to become its honorary chairman, he bought a 33 percent share in the French newspaper Lib√©ration.\\"Italian publisher Carlo Caracciolo dies\\". Herald Sun. He died in Rome, aged 83. According to his biographer and former co- editor of L'Espresso, Nello Ajello : \\"He set an example for free and independent editorial content that initially seemed marginal and exclusive and instead became a major force in Italian newspaper publishing\\". In June 1989, he was awarded the Italian Order of Merit for Labour.

Properties  A cube dissected into six orthoschemes. * All 2-faces are right triangles. * All facets of a d-dimensional orthoscheme are (d ‚àí 1)-dimensional orthoschemes. * The midpoint of the longest edge is the center of the circumscribed sphere. * The case when v_0v_1=v_1v_2=\\\\cdots = v_{d-1}v_d is a generalized Hill tetrahedron. * In 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean space, every convex polytope is scissor congruent to an orthoscheme. * Every hypercube in d-dimensional space can be dissected into d! congruent orthoschemes. A similar dissection into the same number of orthoschemes applies more generally to every hyperrectangle but in this case the orthoschemes may not be congruent. * In 3-dimensional hyperbolic and spherical spaces, the volume of orthoschemes can be expressed in terms of the Lobachevsky function, or in terms of dilogarithms. Dissection into orthoschemes Hugo Hadwiger conjectured in 1956 that every simplex can be dissected into finitely many orthoschemes. The conjecture has been proven in spaces of five or fewer dimensions, but remains unsolved in higher dimensions.

In the , Bahrs Scrub had a population of 1,919 people. History As the name suggests, the area was originally scrub land. The origin of the name is less clear. It has been attributed to early German settlers, Carl Wilhelm Bahr and his son, Wilhelm Bahr. The earliest references to the location call it Jimmybark Scrub and the nearby hill Bark Hill (now Bahrs Hill), so the current names may be a corruption of these. Bahr's Scrub State School opened circa July 1919. It closed in 1929 due to low stuent numbers. Windaroo Valley State High School opened on 1 January 1994. Geography It consists predominantly of acreage blocks although recent developments have been of higher density.  Education  Windaroo Valley State High School is a government secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls at 240 Beaudesert Beenleigh Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 1115 students with 94 teachers (91 full-time equivalent) and 42 non-teaching staff (30 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Demographics In the , Bahrs Scrub recorded a population of 1,512 people, 51.8% female and 48.2% male. The median age of the Bahrs Scrub population was 32 years, 5 years below the national median of 37. 73.9% of people living in Bahrs Scrub were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand 6.3%, England 5.1%, South Africa 1.1%, Netherlands 1%, Zimbabwe 0.7%. 88.9% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.7% Russian, 0.6% Afrikaans, 0.5% Dutch, 0.5% Hungarian, 0.5% Mandarin.

Human involvement typically takes place in observing the problem within context, brainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and implementing the solution. Human-centred design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance. ISO 9241-210:2019(E) Human-centered design builds upon participatory action research by moving beyond participants' involvement and producing solutions to problems rather than solely documenting them. Initial stages usually revolve around immersion, observing, and contextual framing in which innovators immerse themselves with the problem and community. Consequent stages may then focus on community brainstorming, modeling and prototyping, and implementation in community spaces.Innovating for people: Handbook of human-centered design methods. (2012). Pittsburgh, PA: LUMA Institute, LLC. Further, human-centered design typically focuses on integrating technology or other useful tools in order to alleviate problems, especially around issues of health.Matheson, G. O., Pacione, C., Shultz, R. K., & Kl√ºgl, M. (2015). Leveraging human-centered design in chronic disease prevention. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 48(4), 472-479. Once the solution is integrated, human-centered design usually employ system usability scales and community feedback in order to determine the success of the solution. Human-centred Systems  Mike Cooley In Architect or Bee?, Mike Cooley coined the term \\"human-centred systems\\" in the context of the transition in his profession from traditional drafting at a drawing board to computer-aided design.Architect or Bee?, Mike Cooley, South End Press, 1982 Human-centred systems, as used in economics, computing and design, aim to preserve or enhance human skills, in both manual and office work, in environments in which technology tends to undermine the skills that people use in their work.Labor and Monoply Capital.

The Human Centred Systems movement looks sensitively at these forms of science and technology which meet our cultural, historical and societal requirements, and seeks to develop more appropriate forms of technology to meet our long-term aspirations. In the Human Centred System, there exists a symbiotic relation between the human and the machine in which the human being would handle the qualitative subjective judgements and the machine the quantitative elements. It involves a radical redesign of the interface technologies and at a philosophical level the objective is to provide tools (in the Heidegger sense) which would support human skill and ingenuity rather than machines which would objectivise that knowledge\\". Cooley M. (2008) On Human-Machine Symbiosis. In: Gill S. (eds) Cognition, Communication and Interaction. Human-Computer Interaction Series pp 457-485. Springer, London  Rationale for adoption  Even after decades of thought on \\"Human Centered Design\\", management and finance systems still believe that 'another's liability is one's asset' could be true of porous human bodies, embedded in nature and inseparable from each other. On the contrary, our biological and ecological interconnections ensure that 'another's liability is our liability'. Sustainable business systems can only emerge if these biological and ecological interconnections are accepted and accounted for. Using a human-centered approach to design and development has substantial economic and social benefits for users, employers and suppliers. Highly usable systems and products tend to be more successful both technically and commercially. In some areas, such as consumer products, purchasers will pay a premium for well-designed products and systems. Support and help-desk costs are reduced when users can understand and use products without additional assistance. In most countries, employers and suppliers have legal obligations to protect users from risks to their health, and safety and human-centered methods can reduce these risks (e.g. musculoskeletal risks). Systems designed using human-centered methods improve quality, for example, by: * increasing the productivity of users and the operational efficiency of organizations; * being easier to understand and use, thus reducing training and support costs; * increasing usability for people with a wider range of capabilities and thus increasing accessibility; * improving user experience; * reducing discomfort and stress; * providing a competitive advantage, for example by improving brand image; * contributing towards sustainability objectives Human-centered design may be utilized in multiple fields, including sociological sciences and technology. It has been noted for its ability to consider human dignity, access, and ability roles when developing solutions.Buchanan, R. (2001). Human dignity and human rights: Thoughts on the principles of human-centered design. Design issues, 17(3), 35-39. Because of this, human-centered design may more fully incorporate culturally sound, human-informed, and appropriate solutions to problems in a variety of fields rather than solely product and technology- based fields. Because human-centered design focuses on the human experience, researchers and designers can address \\"issues of social justice and inclusion and encourage ethical, reflexive design.\\" Typically, human-centered design is more focused on \\"methodologies and techniques for interacting with people in such a manner as to facilitate the detection of meanings, desires and needs, either by verbal or non-verbal means.\\"Giacomin, J. (2014). What Is Human Centered Design? The Design Journal, 17(4), 606-623. In contrast, user- centered design is another approach and framework of processes which considers the human role in product use, but focuses largely on the production of interactive technology designed around the user's physical attributes rather than social problem solving.Abras, C., Maloney-Krichmar, D., & Preece, J. (2004). User-centered design. Bainbridge, W. Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 37(4), 445-456. The Stanford d.school at Stanford University is a large proponent of human-centered design and teaches innovative approaches to human problems by focusing on empathy- informed solutions.http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp- content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf Critiques Human- centered design has been both lauded and criticised for its ability to actively solve problems with affected communities. Criticisms include the inability of human-centered design to push the boundaries of available technology by solely tailoring to the demands of present-day solutions, rather than focus on possible future solutions. In addition, human-centered design often considers context, but does not offer tailored approaches for very specific groups of people. New research on innovative approaches include youth-centered health design, which focuses on youth as the central aspect with particular needs and limitations not always addressed by human-centered design approaches. Whilst users are very important for some types of innovation (namely incremental innovation), focusing too much on the user may result in producing an outdated or no longer necessary product or service. This is because the insights that you achieve from studying the user today are insights that are related to the users of today and the environment she or he lives in today. If your solution will be available only two or three years from now, your user may have developed new preferences, wants and needs by then.

Sampson explains the original title of the book as a deliberate allusion to Educating Rita (1980), and uses the plot of that play to illustrate his argument. Sampson's book is a response to Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct specifically and Chomskyan linguistic nativism broadly. The title, Educating Eve, was dropped after the first edition because the allusion to Educating Rita \\"was deemed unduly mysterious\\". Geoffrey Sampson, The 'Language Instinct' Debate, revised edition, (London: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005), 2. The revised edition (2005) contains an additional chapter and \\"many passages, from a few words up to new chapter- sections, that discuss relevant scientific findings which have emerged since the first edition, or respond to objections made by critics of that edition.\\" Sampson (2005): xii.  Abstract  Sampson critically evaluates the ability of theories of linguistic nativism to accommodate the growing understanding of human brain processing over the course of the late 20th century. He proposes an alternative explanation, borrowing some ideas and terminology from Karl Popper.  Overview  * \\"Eve was not a born know-all. She was ignorant. But she was a good learner.\\"Sampson (2005): 25. ‚Äî Geoffrey Sampson, Educating Eve The book has seven chapters introduced by a foreword by Paul Postal who claims an agnostic position regarding the debate. He expresses serious concerns regarding the strength of the \\"nativist\\" argument; but despite being unconvinced of the alternative view, he commends Sampson for challenging nativism and attempting to make a case for an alternative. The first chapter of Educating Eve considers broad contours of the nature versus nurture debate in regard to human knowledge generally, before narrowing this down to the rise of late 20th century linguistic nativism in particular. It concludes with an overview of the methodology of the rest of the book. Chapter 2 reports evidence that was available to the \\"first wave\\" of nativists (like Chomsky) during the 1960s and 1970s. Chapter 3 reports the results of research that have become available since then. Chapter 4 turns to examining the distinctive arguments of \\"new wave\\" nativists (like Pinker). Chapter 5 presents a case for an alternative view. In chapter 7 Sampson concludes with a short personal perspective on sociological changes in the nature of academic discourse over the 40 years of the debate regarding nativism. He attributes the popularity of nativism to various features of these sociological changes.  Annotated journal commentary  * Victor M. Longa.

Cowley notes philosophical difficulties with each extreme, as they are argued by Sampson and Pinker: Sampson's version of the nurture position also argues for philosophical dualism; whereas Pinker's version of the nature position also argues for an ontological reality for syntax. Both these auxiliary arguments are unsatisfactory to many writers who address the relevant broader philosophical questions. Cowley proposes an alternative: that language acquisition involves culturally determined language skills, apprehended by a biologically determined faculty that responds to them. In other words, he proposes that each extreme is right in what it affirms, but wrong in what it denies. Both cultural diversity of language, and a learning instinct, can be affirmed; neither need be denied.

Bike paths around Melbourne have developed since the campaigns of Bicycle Network and the strong awareness that nine editions of the Bike Paths & Rail Trails Guide have created of the network . With the increased recognition from all levels of government of the benefit of cycling activities, Melbourne today has a comprehensive set of shared bicycle trails along its river and creek systems and alongside its freeways and train lines.VicRoads - Bicycle Route MapsMelbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google MapsMelbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google Earth The length of the trails in Melbourne, as of 2014, totals around 1,900 km. It is possible to cycle from Werribee in the west to Research in the east (approx 62 km) and Craigieburn in the north and Seaford in the south (about 78 km) and points in between and only have to travel on the occasional piece of road. Often passing through relaxed park surrounds, cycling on many of Melbourne's bike paths can feel like a day out in the country despite remaining within metropolitan Melbourne. Melbourne's bike paths are often easily accessed from its train system. The latest edition of the Bike Paths & Rail Trails Guide shows the complete metro network in great detail together with path descriptions and more than 18 destination country rail trails.  Usage  In 2006 VicRoads installed bicycle counters on the trails, at seventeen locations throughout inner Melbourne. These counters are providing hard data on the usage of Melbourne's trails. For example: the Anniversary Outer Circle Trail at Cotham Rd Kew, has about 20 cyclists per hour throughout the day, whereas the Yarra River Trail, north side of Morell Bridge, has a distinct peak hour rate of about 250/hr and 50/hr in non-peak periods. This supports the casual observation that the former is used mainly for recreation and the latter for recreation and commuting.  Bike paths along freeways  A number of freeways have been constructed with dedicated separate bicycle paths built alongside, including Eastlink, the Deer Park Bypass, and the Metropolitan Ring Road. However, the CityLink tollway system was built without including provision for cyclists along several sections including the Bolte Bridge. Cyclists are also excluded from riding the West Gate Freeway over the West Gate Bridge, although exceptions are made for some special bicycle events like Around the Bay in a Day organised by Bicycle Network. The Westgate Punt ferry service provides an alternative to the bridge.  Future expansion  In December 2008, the Victorian State Government (then Labour) released their Victorian Transport Plan which budgeted $100 million for cycling over 12 years. In 2009, the Victorian Cycling Strategy was also released. However the Victorian Auditor-General reviewed this Strategy in 2012 and found there had been almost no progress on the items in the Plan, which included more cycle lanes and junction treatments, and that it had been sidelined by the new Liberal government.http://blogs.crikey.com.au/theurbanist/2011/08/20/is-the- auditor-general-on-track-with-cycling/ Alan Davies in Crikey In 2012 there was an outcry from cyclists following the almost total deletion of cycling projects from the State budget, with protests organised by Bicycle Network Victoria. Parks Victoria strategy includes expanding the trails Development of the network is slowed by the number of agencies that may be involved when a new path is proposed. Such agencies could include VicRoads, VicTrack, Parks Victoria, Melbourne Water and the local Councils. The network is clearly fragmented along Council boundaries. Some examples would include: *the St Georges Rd Trail at the boundary of Darebin and Whittlesea *the Gardiners Creek gap at the boundary of Boroondara, Stonnington and Monash *the termination of the East Malvern Station to Centre Rd Trail at the boundary of Monash and Kingston  See also  * Cycling in Melbourne * Cycling in Victoria * :Category:Bike paths in Melbourne * :Category:Rail trails in Australia  References  External links  * Bike Paths & Rail Trails Guide * The Principal Bicycle Network (PBN) * Melbourne bike routes @ bikely.com * Where to Ride Melbourne cycling guide book Category:Cycling in Melbourne ","title":"Bike paths in Melbourne"},{"id":"20740659","text":"n-Butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA, NBCA), a cyanoacrylate ester, is a butyl ester of 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid. It is a colorless liquid with a sharp, irritating odor. It is insoluble in water. Its chief use is as the main component of medical cyanoacrylate glues. It can be encountered under various trade names, e.g. Cutseal, MediBond, MediCryl, PeriAcryl, GluStitch, Xoin, Gesika, VetGlu, Vetbond, LiquiVet, Indermil, LiquiBand, Histoacryl, IFABond, CutisSeal and others. The generic international nonproprietary name (INN) for NBCA is enbucrilate. In medical and veterinary applications, NBCA, isobutyl cyanoacrylate, and octyl cyanoacrylate are commonly used. They are bacteriostatic and their use is usually painless. Butyl esters provide stronger bond, but are rigid. Octyl esters, while providing weaker bond, are more flexible. Blends of octyl cyanoacrylate and n-butyl cyanoacrylate are available (such as GLUture) which offer both flexibility and a strong bond. n-Butyl cyanoacrylate is also used for embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations before their surgical treatment. NBCA in monomer form is soluble in acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, nitromethane, and methylene chloride. It polymerizes rapidly in presence of ionic substances such as moisture, blood, or tissue fluids. NBCA has unique properties compared to other cyanoacrylates such as octyl cyanoacrylate or isoamyl cyanoacrylate. The polymerized form has excellent tensile strength and is very effective in closing surgical or wound incisions. The closure of the wound or cut is quick (about 30 to 45 seconds) and the product has inherently some valuable bacteriostatic properties. The cosmetic outcome of the closure is comparable or generally better than an equivalent suture substitute with least amount of scarring visible after three to six months. Also important is the degradation properties of polymerized NBCA within the body. This property of NBCA has made it a very useful polymer to create various nanoparticles for delivery of drugs into the body with sustained release profiles. Heating to higher temperatures causes pyrolysis and depolymerization of the cured glue, producing gaseous products strongly irritating to lungs and eyes. Medical applications The medical applications of butyl cyanoacrylate include its use as an adhesive for lacerations of the skin, and in the treatment of bleeding from vascular structures. Butyl cyanoacrylate has been used to treat arteriovenous malformations by application of the glue into the abnormality through angiography. In gastroenterology, butyl cyanoacrylate is used to treat bleeding gastric varices, which are dilated veins that occur in the setting of liver cirrhosis or thrombosis of the splenic vein. The gastric varices are accessed by endoscopy, which uses a flexible fibre-optic camera to enter the stomach. They are injected with a catheter needle inserted into the varix through the endoscope. Other sites of varices, including esophageal varices, duodenal varices and colonic varices. Gastric varices have also been obliterated with recurrent injection treatment with butyl cyanoacrylate.

She again lost out in David in the quarter final of the KL Open the following week, pushing the world number one to two tie breaks in the first two games. The next few months saw Brown stack up some solid results, quarter final appearances in Cayman, Malaysia, Australia and Hong Kong. Another quarter final, this time at the World Open, taking out Madeline Perry in the round of sixteen in a 100-minute marathon. Omneya Abdel Kawy got the better of her again in the quarters. October saw Brown really hit the headlines. She represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. She came away from the event the only player to secure three medals. A truly dramatic win over Madeline Perry in the quarter final of the singles was memorable, especially coming from two games down. She lost out to Nicol David in the semi final and the received a walk over Alison Waters in the bronze medal play off. She took another bronze medal with teammate Donna Urquhart in the Women's Doubles. The icing on the cake was the Gold medal she achieved in the Mixed Doubles with partner Cameron Pilley. She carried this form over to Mexico where she reached another Gold semi final. She outgunned Jenny Duncalf in the quarter final, her first win over the world number two. She couldn't cause another upset in the semi final, going out 11‚Äì9 in the fifth to Rachael Grinham. A semi final in the Carol Weymuller Open and a quarter final in the Qatar Classic followed. Another standout moment for Brown came in December at the Women's World Team Championships. She helped Australia lift the title with a stunning victory over England's Laura Massaro in the final. She topped off her year with a final appearance at the Punj Lloyd Masters. She was defeated by Jenny Duncalf in the final. Brown was rewarded for her rise in form by being given Wispa's 'Most Improved Player of the Year' award. She didn't let up in 2011 and collected her eleventh and biggest tour title at the Greenwich Open with victory over Joelle King in the final.

In his early history of Hingham, attorney Solomon Lincoln recited the oft-told tale of Leavitt's supposed origins: \\"The family tradition concerning John Leavitt is that he was an indented apprentice in England,\\" wrote Lincoln in 1827, \\"and that he absconded from his master and came to this country when nineteen years of age.... He received a grant of land in this town in 1636. His homestead was in Leavitt-street, recently so named, on both sides of the river.\\"History of the Town of Hingham, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, Solomon Lincoln, Jr., Caleb Gill, Jr. and Farmer and Brown, Hingham, Mass., 1837 In the same year, Leavitt took the Freeman's Oath of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In records on file at Boston Leavitt is shown on March 3, 1636, as pledging loyalty to the English Crown. In the early Massachusetts record the early English settler is listed as John Levett,Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, as the tailor apparently spelled his own name for several decades, until it became corrupted later in life.John Levett, whose English name became John Leavitt in America, and New Hampshire settler Thomas Levet, whose name became similarly corrupted to Thomas Leavitt, were the first to carry the name in America. The corruption in spelling, not unusual in an era of 'flexible phonetics,' distinguishes the American descendants from the original English family. Although the corruption into 'Leavett' was seen in England, the corruption into 'Leavitt' was not. The closest thing in English records was John Leavett, Gent., of Sussex, enrolled at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1590, who was alternately listed as 'John Levett.' After moving to Hingham, Leavitt's first wife Mary died,The surname of Leavitt's first wife Mary is unknown, but it may have been Lovett. and he subsequently remarried at Hingham on December 16, 1646, Sarah Gilman, daughter of Edward Gilman Sr.,Searches into the History of the Gillman or Gilman Family, Alexander William Gillman, Printed by Elliot Stock, London, 1895 a fellow Hingham resident who later removed with his family to Ipswich, Massachusetts, and thence to Exeter, New Hampshire,Two of John Leavitt's children later removed to Exeter: son Samuel by Leavitt's first wife; and son Moses, child of John Leavitt and Sarah Gilman, whose father lived by that time at Exeter. where the Gilman family became well-known businessmen, statesmen and American patriots.New England Family History, Vol. III, Henry Cole Quinby, Office of Publication, New York, 1910 Sarah Gilman's sister Lydia married Daniel Cushing, who became Hingham's town clerk While serving as Hingham's third town clerk, Cushing kept a remarkable journal of goings-on in the town, which included notations on current gossip as well as the formal record of the town's events. Cushing's journal was later reprinted in a photographic format with reproductions of his pages in his striking penmanship. and John Leavitt's lifelong friend and, later, witness to his will. Leavitt became active in Hingham town affairs, was named a Sergeant in the militia, as well as Deputy to the Massachusetts General Court from 1656-64, a Selectman The Genealogy of the Sprague's in Hingham, Hosea Sprague, Published by Hosea Sprague, Hingham, 1828 for the town in 1661 and many subsequent years, and then Deacon of the church, pastored by Rev.

Peter Hobart's son David and his wife Joanna Quincy, daughter of Edmund Quincy of Quincy, Massachusetts. In between his public life and helping raise 13 children, Leavitt embarked on a lifelong pursuit of land, perhaps in recognition of its limited availability in his native England. By 1665, Leavitt and Lieut. John Smith,History of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, 1622-1918, Vol. I, Louis A. Cook, The S. J. Clarke Publishing Co., New York, 1918 with whom he frequently collaborated in his real estate dealings, had secured on the border of Hingham and what is today Cohasset.A Narrative History of the Town of Cohasset, Massachusetts, Edwin Victor Bigelow, The Committee on Town History, Press of Samuel Usher, Boston, 1898In return for their land grant, the town required Smith and Leavitt to pay the local Wampanoag Chief Josiah. That payment for the 12-acre grant, made exactly 30 years after Englishmen had settled Hingham, was considered sufficient recompense to the Indians for the entire township, which the colonists had never purchased. With Smith and Leavitt's payment to the Indian Sachem Josiah, the town considered the matter settled. Living nearby Leavitt's house lot in today's Hingham Center, located at some distance from the main village, was his friend Nathaniel Baker,Historical Collections, Being a General Collection of Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, &c.;, Relating to the History and Antiquities of Every Town in Massachusetts, John Warner Barber, Published by Warren Lazell, Worcester, Mass., 1848 who also often purchased real estate with Leavitt. The two men apparently enjoyed particularly warm relations with the local Indians. Deacon John Leavitt assisted in the burial of a local Indian chief, and Baker was fined 20 shillings for \\"entertaining an Indian or Indians contrary to a Town order.\\" Nearby Leavitt's home described as 'over the Delaware' (River) was the so-called Great Rock, an enormous boulder subsequently blown up in the nineteenth century for building material. Onto its granite face was incised, by an early settler, a large inscription noting the accomplishments of Hingham's earliest settlers. The inscription read: Interior, Old Ship Church, Hingham. Original seating chart from the 1680s in frame on wall beside upstairs window Here Lyeth Buried Ye Body of Deacon John Leavitt, Aged 83 Years, Died November Ye 20, 1691 \\"When wild in wood the naked savage ran, Lazell, Low, Loring, Lane, Lewis, Lincoln, Hersey, Leavitt, Jacobs, King, Jones and Sprague, Stemmed the wild torrent of a barbarous age, And were the first invaders of this country, From the Island of Great Britain, in 1635.\\" In keeping with the spirit of the inscription, and despite his own warm relations with the local Native American tribe, John Leavitt bought enormous tracts of land The Clapp Memorial: Record of the Clapp Family in America, Ebenezer Clapp, Printed by David Clapp & Son, Publishers, Boston, 1876 from the local Indians, for a meager outlay of cash.John Levet (eventually Leavitt), Hingham, MA, 1661 deed from Native Americans, Suffolk Deeds, Suffolk County, Mass., 1894 Leavitt made several such purchases during his lifetime, most lying in the so-called 'Narragansett country,' in the region south of Hingham near the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border. One such tract, fifteen-miles (24 km)-square, was purchased by Leavitt and his friends Capt. Joshua Hobart The land on which Old Ship Church stands was purchased by the town from Capt. Joshua Hobart. (twin brother of Rev. Peter) and Lieut. John Smith. In many such deeds, John Leavitt the settler is called 'John Levet' or sometimes 'John Levett' or even 'John Levit,' but rarely John Leavitt. By May 3, 1680, when a town meeting was held to decide whether a new meeting house would be built upon the site of the old, John Leavitt was Deacon of the church, and one of the chief proponents for the new building.A Discourse Delivered to the First Parish in Hingham, Sept. 8, 1869, Calvin Lincoln, Published by the Parish, James F. Cotter & Co., Boston, 1873 Leavitt's speeches on the need for a new sanctuary ultimately proved persuasive. The Old Ship Church, so-called because the hammerbeam roof construction recalled that of an upside-down ship's hull, was completed July 26, 1681, when the townspeople of Hingham gathered on the knoll bordering on Bachelor's Row (now Main Street) to watch the raising of the frame of the new building. Observing the festivities was Deacon John Leavitt, aged seventy- three, who had argued the need for the new wooden edifice. The Deacon's pew remains set aside today in the building, over 300 years later.John Leavitt's gravestone and remains are today in the graveyard at Hingham Center, not far from Old Ship Church. He was probably initially interred in front of the church, and was among the early settlers whose graves were moved when the road in front of the house of worship was widened, necessitating removal of the earliest graves, which were located in front of the church instead of behind it, where the church's current graveyard was later located. Leavitt's tombstone and remains were then likely moved to the Hingham Center cemetery, closer to the ancestral Leavitt home. Tailor John Leavitt died at Hingham November 20, 1691, at age 83.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and was wounded twice, both times occurring on May 27. Chapin was killed in action fighting in Louisiana, and after his death was promoted to brigadier general. Early life and career Edward P. Chapin was born in 1831 in Waterloo, a village located in Seneca County, New York.Eicher, p. 591. He was the youngest of six children of Ephraim Chapin (1789 ‚Äì1871), a Presbyterian minister, and of Elizabeth White Maltby (1794‚Äì1886). Chapin's siblings were named Ephraim, Eliza, Maria, Louise, and Charles. Chapin's initial education came from a local school in Waterloo, and then he studied law at Buffalo as well as at Ballston Spa. He was admitted to New York's bar association in 1852, and then became a lawyer, practicing in Buffalo.Warner, p. 79. Chapin was also part of the Niagaras, the city's first semi-pro baseball club. He was also active in the New York's militia, serving as a captain in the state forces. Civil War service and death When the American Civil War began in 1861, Chapin chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. He was mustered into the Union Army on September 6 as a captain in the 44th New York Infantry Regiment. The 44th left New York on October 21, numbering 1,061 strong, and joined the Army of the Potomac. On January 2, 1862, Chapin was promoted to major, and he fought during the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia. On May 27 he was seriously wounded in the Battle of Hanover Court House, among the 86 casualties the 44th suffered in the fight. Chapin's performance there was praised by his commanding officer, Brig. Gen. John H. Martindale. Chapin during the Civil War On July 4, 1862, Chapin was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the 44th New York, however he resigned that day and returned home. During the convalescence from his wound, Chapin was approached by Buffalo officials requesting he raise and lead a new regiment, the 116th New York Volunteer Infantry. On September 5 Chapin was appointed commander of the 116th, with the rank of colonel. He led the regiment south to Baltimore, Maryland, where it remained until ordered to Mississippi that November. Chapin and the 116th arrived at Ship Island, Mississippi, by sail on December 14, 1862, and by the end of the year they reached New Orleans, Louisiana. On February 9, 1863, Chapin was given brigade command in the army of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, operating against Confederate forces defending the Mississippi River. Chapin and his command saw action at the Battle of Plains Store on May 21, where he was again praised for his conduct by his superiors. Six days later Chapin led his brigade (part of Brig Gen. Christopher C. Augur's division) against the Confederate fortifications around Port Hudson, Louisiana, the first assaults in the Siege of Port Hudson.Warner, p. 80. What happened has been described as: After being wounded in the American Civil War with the second injury causing his death, Chapin's body was sent back to Waterloo, New York, and was buried there in the city's Maple Grove Cemetery. Four months after his death, President Abraham Lincoln sent Chapin's father a commission, appointing Chapin a brigadier general \\"for gallant and meritorious service at the assault on Port Hudson.\\" The commission was dated from the day of Chapin's death, but was never confirmed by the U.S. Congress. Chapin Parkway in Buffalo, New York, was named in his honor.

No sooner did he arrive was he presumed missing in action. It took a year for him to be discovered. Returning home to Pine Valley, he was reunited with his mother, Kate Martin, and brother, Dr. Joe Martin. Setting down roots, Paul opened his own law firm. 1971: Phoebe Tyler approached Paul with a proposition to date her daughter, Anne Tyler. Paul was intrigued by Anne and was more than willing to comply. He knew he had competition, as Anne was still seeing Nick Davis. 1972: Paul's love for Anne was left unrequited when she decided to marry Nick Davis. He was convinced they would remain friends, but he always wanted more. Anne turned to Paul when Nick made it clear he wanted a divorce. Paul became her lawyer, but their time together was leading to something more. Anne learned she was pregnant with Nick's child. Nick had wanted nothing to do with Anne, very well their child. Paul proposed that he would raise the child as his own. Anne accepted his proposal, and made plans to become the newest Mrs. Martin. 1973: Paul and Anne's marriage was actually working out. Paul could tell that as time went by, Anne was actually falling in love with him. Their happiness was short lived when Anne miscarried. She told Nick the truth about his child and their marriage. Though Nick and Anne were spending more time together again, Paul was not worried. Nick was now married to Kitty Shea, and they were expecting their own child. Anne abruptly left Pine Valley for New York. Paul was called by the hospital: Anne was in an accident. Paul and Phoebe arrived and saw Nick keeping vigil over Anne's comatose body. Paul demanded to know what had happened. Anne had gone to New York to make her final decision about Nick. That was all Paul needed to hear. Paul thought Anne had chosen Nick. He kicked Nick out of the hospital and waited for Anne. As long as he was her husband, he was going to keep his promise and stay by her bedside. When Anne awoke, Paul was despondent. He told her they were getting a divorce. Anne walked out of the hospital alone, and made her way out of Pine Valley. 1974: Paul swamped himself in his work so as to avoid thinking about Anne. His nephew Jeff Martin was his priority now. He was up for the murder of Jason Maxwell, his wife's lover. While looking through his affairs, the name Margo Flax constantly came up. She was Jason's former lover. Margo helped Paul to get to the bottom of his affairs. Their long hours together sparked a romance. Anne returned to Pine Valley after recovering in Seattle. She wanted to explain herself to Paul, but he was still unwilling to listen. Margo romanced his broken heart. Before he knew it, they were set to be married. 1975: Paul's marriage to Margo was crumbling. He turned to Anne for guidance. He realized that he could not just be Anne's friend. They began an affair. After a torrid weekend of love making, Paul decided he was going to break up with Margo. When he arrived home, Margo had shocking news. She was pregnant with Paul's son. Paul was now trapped in his marriage. He broke the news to Anne who agreed he needed to be there for his child. 1976: Paul found out that Margo had planned to adopt a child and pass it off as her own child. Paul rejected Margo. He turned to Anne once again. One night, Margo tried to poison Anne at The Boutique by causing a carbon monoxide leak. Paul saved her. Nick revealed that she was pregnant with child, Paul's child. Paul and Anne decided to marry again. On their honeymoon, Anne fell ill with toxoplasmosis. Dr. Chris Karras revealed that Anne's child would be born severely mentally handicapped. Chris encouraged a therapeutic abortion. Anne refused. She was not going to lose another child. The Martin's greatest fear was realized when Beth Martin was born. Paul wanted Beth to be institutionalized, but Anne would have none of it. She fired all of the nanny's, and barricaded herself at home to care for Beth. 1977: Paul struggled to keep Anne sane. She refused to let Beth out of her sight for a minute. Paul finally got Anne to attend a meeting for parents with disabled children. But as soon as the meeting was over, she stormed her way home to be with Beth. Beth had died of SIDS. The trauma of the situation proved to be too much for Anne. She had a break from reality, cradling a photo Beth as if she was still alive. Phoebe and Paul were forced to institutionalize Anne. 1978: Without Anne, Paul threw himself into his work. His main priority was to see Ray Gardner thrown into prison for raping Ruth. After succeeding at that, he petitioned for Tad to be formally adopted by Ruth and Joe. With his father in prison, Tad's adoption was approved and finalized. Paul found a supportive shoulder in Ellen Shepard, a childhood friend and the new owner of Anne's old business The Boutique. Ellen confided in Paul her apprehensions about her relationship with Mark Dalton, a man ten years her junior. Paul was Ellen's age, and they had a lot in common. As time went by, they began to see more of each other. 1979: Paul and Ellen's relationship continued to blossom. Paul decided to begin divorce proceedings from Anne. But, Phoebe got wind and confronted him. She blamed Ellen for Paul's change of heart, but it had nothing to do with her. Paul believed all hope was lost for Anne's recovery. The doctors at Oak Haven contacted Paul with good news. Anne was showing signs of recovery. Paul held off his divorce proceedings for the time being. 1980: Anne finally made clear signs of recovery. Her doctors allowed her to move back home, but she insisted in moving in with Phoebe first. Paul wanted to save his marriage and tried his best to rekindle their love. 1981‚Äì82: Anne agreed to move back in with Paul. He began his run for state office. But his competitors were cut throat. One day, Anne's car was blocked in and she decided to use Paul's car to go see her mother. When she started the ignition, the car exploded with her inside. The bomb was meant for Paul. Filled with grief and guilt, Paul tried to come to terms with Anne's death. He decided Pine Valley had nothing left to offer him and left to build his life anew. 1985: Kate died peacefully in her sleep. All of the Martins returned to say farewell to their beloved grandmother. 1995: Paul returned to Pine Valley for the Martin family housewarming party. While looking back at his life in Pine Valley, Paul could not forget to remember the love he shared with Anne.

As a symbol of the U.S. military, the phrase The Pentagon is also often used as a metonym for the Department of Defense and its leadership. Located in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., the building was designed by American architect George Bergstrom and built by contractor John McShain. Ground was broken on 11 September 1941, and the building was dedicated on 15 January 1943. General Brehon Somervell provided the major motivating power behind the project; Colonel Leslie Groves was responsible for overseeing the project for the U.S. Army. The Pentagon is the world's largest office building, with about of floor space, of which are used as offices. Some 23,000 military and civilian employees, and another 3,000 non-defense support personnel, work in the Pentagon. It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, and five ring corridors per floor with a total of of corridors. The central pentagonal plaza is nicknamed \\"ground zero\\" on the presumption that it would be a prime target in a nuclear war. On 11 September 2001, exactly sixty years after the building's construction began, American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked and flown into the western side of the building, killing 189 people (59 victims and the five terrorists on board the airliner, as well as 125 victims in the building), according to the 9/11 Commission Report. It was the first significant foreign attack on Washington's governmental facilities since the city was burned by the British during the War of 1812. The Pentagon is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. Layout and facilities The Pentagon building spans , and includes an additional as a central courtyard. Starting with the north side and moving clockwise, its five fa√ßade entrances are the Mall Terrace, the River Terrace, the Concourse (or Metro Station), the South Parking, and the Heliport. On the north side of the building, the Mall Entrance, which also features a portico, leads out to a terrace that is used for ceremonies. The River Entrance, which features a portico projecting out , is on the northeast side, overlooking the lagoon and facing Washington. A stepped terrace on the River Entrance leads down to the lagoon; and a landing dock was used until the late 1960s to ferry personnel between Bolling Air Force Base and the Pentagon. The main entrance for visitors is on the southeast side, as are the Pentagon Metro station and the bus station. There is also a concourse on the southeast side of the second floor of the building, which contains a mini-shopping mall. The south parking lot adjoins the southwest facade, and the west side of the Pentagon faces Washington Boulevard. The concentric rings are designated from the center out as \\"A\\" through \\"E\\" (with additional \\"F\\" and \\"G\\" rings in the basement). \\"E\\" Ring offices are the only ones with outside views and are generally occupied by senior officials. Office numbers go clockwise around each of the rings, and have two parts: a nearest-corridor number (1 to 10) followed by a bay number (00 to 99), so office numbers range from 100 to 1099. These corridors radiate out from the central courtyard, with corridor 1 beginning with the Concourse's south end. Each numbered radial corridor intersects with the corresponding numbered group of offices (for example, corridor 5 divides the 500 series office block). There are a number of historical displays in the building, particularly in the \\"A\\" and \\"E\\" rings. Floors in the Pentagon are lettered \\"B\\" for Basement and \\"M\\" for Mezzanine, both of which are below ground level. The concourse is on the second floor at the Metro entrance. Above ground floors are numbered 1 to 5. Room numbers are given as the floor, concentric ring, and office number (which is in turn the nearest corridor number followed by the bay number). Thus, office 2B315 is on the second floor, B ring, and nearest to corridor 3 (between corridors 2 and 3). One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor, get to the A (innermost) ring, go to and take corridor 3, and then turn left on ring B to get to bay 15. It is possible for a person to walk between any two points in the Pentagon in less than seven minutes. The complex includes eating and exercise facilities, and meditation and prayer rooms. Just south of the Pentagon are Pentagon City and Crystal City, extensive shopping, business, and high-density residential districts in Arlington. Arlington National Cemetery is to the north. The Pentagon is surrounded by the relatively complex Pentagon road network. The Pentagon has six Washington, DC ZIP Codes (despite its location in Virginia). The Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four service branches each have their own ZIP Code. As of July 2020, Pentagon tours were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. View from the south HistoryBackground= Main Navy Building (foreground) and the Munitions Building were temporary structures built during World War I on the National Mall. The Department of War headquarters was in the Munitions Building for several years before moving into the Pentagon.1945 map of the Pentagon road network, including present-day State Route 27 and part of the Shirley Highway, as well as the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings near the Lincoln Memorial Before the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was headquartered in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the U.S. Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s, a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up being used by the Department of State. When World War II broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that the United States would be drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson found the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out. Stimson told U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in May 1941 that the War Department needed additional space. On 17 July 1941, a congressional hearing took place, organized by Virginia congressman Clifton Woodrum, regarding proposals for new War Department buildings. Woodrum pressed Brigadier General Eugene Reybold, who was representing the War Department at the hearing, for an \\"overall solution\\" to the department's \\"space problem\\" rather than building yet more temporary buildings. Reybold agreed to report back to the congressman within five days. The War Department called upon its construction chief, General Brehon Somervell, to come up with a plan. =Planning= Government officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed across the Potomac River, in Arlington County, Virginia. Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington Experimental Farm, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site. The site originally chosen was Arlington Farms, which had a roughly pentagonal shape, so the building was planned accordingly as an irregular pentagon. Concerned that the new building could obstruct the view of Washington, D.C., from Arlington Cemetery, President Roosevelt ended up selecting the Hoover Airport site instead. The building retained its pentagonal layout because a major redesign at that stage would have been costly, and Roosevelt liked the design. Freed of the constraints of the asymmetric Arlington Farms site, it was modified into a regular pentagon, which resembled the fortifications of the gunpowder age. On 28 July, Congress authorized funding for a new Department of War building in Arlington, which would house the entire department under one roof, and President Roosevelt officially approved of the Hoover Airport site on 2 September. While the project went through the approval process in late July 1941, Somervell selected the contractors, including John McShain, Inc. of Philadelphia, which had built Washington National Airport in Arlington, the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, along with Wise Contracting Company, Inc. and Doyle and Russell, both from Virginia. In addition to the Hoover Airport site and other government-owned land, construction of the Pentagon required an additional , which were acquired at a cost of $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The Hell's Bottom neighborhood, consisting of numerous pawnshops, factories, approximately 150 homes, and other buildings around Columbia Pike, was also cleared to make way for the Pentagon. Later, of land were transferred to Arlington National Cemetery and to Fort Myer, leaving for the Pentagon. =Construction= Contracts totaling $31,100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) were finalized with McShain and the other contractors on 11 September, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day. Among the design requirements, Somervell required the structural design to accommodate floor loads of up to , which was done in case the building became a records storage facility at some time after the end of the current war. A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply during World War II. Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River, and a lagoon was created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance. To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators. Indiana limestone was used for the building's fa√ßade. Architectural and structural design work for the Pentagon proceeded simultaneously with construction, with initial drawings provided in early October 1941, and most of the design work completed by 1 June 1942\\\\. At times the construction work got ahead of the design, with different materials used than specified in the plans. Pressure to speed up design and construction intensified after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, with Somervell demanding that of space at the Pentagon be available for occupation by 1 April 1943. David J. Witmer replaced Bergstrom as chief architect on 11 April after Bergstrom resigned due to charges, unrelated to the Pentagon project, of improper conduct while he was president of the American Institute of Architects. Construction was completed 15 January 1943. Soil conditions of the siteon the Potomac River floodplainpresented challenges, as did the varying elevations across the site, which ranged from above sea level. Two retaining walls were built to compensate for the elevation variations, and cast-in-place piles were used to deal with the soil conditions. Construction of the Pentagon was completed in approximately 16 months at a total cost of $83 million (equivalent to $ in ). The building's approximate height is , and each of the five sides is in length. The building was built one wing at a time; each wing was occupied as soon as it was completed, even as construction continued on the remaining wings. The Pentagon was designed in accordance with the racial segregation laws in force in the state of Virginia at the time, with separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white and black persons; the sets of lavatories were side by side, and the dining areas for black persons were in the basement. However, when Roosevelt visited the facility before its dedication, he ordered removal of the \\"Whites Only\\" signs, and the Pentagon became the only building in Virginia where segregation laws (which remained in force until 1965) were not enforced. The side by side sets of restrooms still exist, but are used by all. IncidentsProtests= The Pentagon became a focal point for protests against the Vietnam War during the late 1960s. A group of 2,500 women, organized by Women Strike for Peace, demonstrated outside of Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara's office at the Pentagon on 15 February 1967. In May 1967, a group of 20 demonstrators held a sit-in outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff's office, which lasted four days before they were arrested. In one of the better known incidents, on 21 October 1967, some 35,000 anti-war protesters organized by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, gathered for a demonstration at the Defense Department (the \\"March on the Pentagon\\"), where they were confronted by some 2,500 armed soldiers. During the protest, a famous picture was taken, where George Harris placed carnations into the soldiers' gun barrels. The march concluded with an attempt to \\"exorcise\\" the building. On 19 May 1972, the Weather Underground Organization bombed a fourth-floor women's restroom, in \\"retaliation\\" for the Nixon administration's bombing of Hanoi in the final stages of the Vietnam War. On 17 March 2007, 4,000 to 15,000 people (estimates vary significantly) protested the Iraq War by marching from the Lincoln Memorial to the Pentagon's north parking lot. =Renovation= From 1998 to 2011, the Pentagon was completely gutted and reconstructed in phases to bring it up to modern standards and improve security and efficiency. Asbestos was removed and all office windows sealed. As originally built, most Pentagon office space consisted of open bays which spanned an entire ring. These offices used cross- ventilation from operable windows instead of air conditioning for cooling. Gradually, bays were subdivided into private offices with many using window air conditioning units. With renovations now complete, the new space includes a return to open office bays, a new Universal Space Plan of standardized office furniture and partitions developed by Studios Architecture. =11 September 2001 attacks= right upright=1.3 On 11 September 2001, coincidentally the 60th anniversary of the Pentagon's groundbreaking, a team of five al-Qaeda affiliated hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 77, en route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, and deliberately crashed the Boeing 757 airliner into the western side of the Pentagon at 9:37 am EDT as part of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The impact of the plane severely damaged the outer ring of one wing of the building and caused its partial collapse. At the time of the attacks, the Pentagon was under renovation and many offices were unoccupied, resulting in fewer casualties. Only 800 of 4,500 people who would have been in the area were there because of the work. Furthermore, the area hit, on the side of the Heliport facade, was the section best prepared for such an attack. The renovation there, improvements which resulted from the Oklahoma City bombing, had nearly been completed. It was the only area of the Pentagon with a sprinkler system, and it had been reconstructed with a web of steel columns and bars to withstand bomb blasts. The steel reinforcement, bolted together to form a continuous structure through all of the Pentagon's five floors, kept that section of the building from collapsing for 30 minutes‚Äîenough time for hundreds of people to crawl out to safety. The area struck by the plane also had blast-resistant windows‚Äî2 inches thick and 2,500 pounds each‚Äîthat stayed intact during the crash and fire. It had fire doors that opened automatically and newly built exits that allowed people to get out. Contractors already involved with the renovation were given the added task of rebuilding the sections damaged in the attacks. This additional project was named the \\"Phoenix Project,\\" and was charged with having the outermost offices of the damaged section occupied by 11 September 2002. When the damaged section of the Pentagon was repaired, a small indoor memorial and chapel were added at the point of impact. For the fifth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, a memorial of 184 beams of light shone up from the center courtyard of the Pentagon, one light for each victim of the attack. In addition, an American flag is hung each year on the side of the Pentagon damaged in the attacks, and the side of the building is illuminated at night with blue lights. After the attacks, plans were developed for an outdoor memorial, with construction underway in 2006. This Pentagon Memorial consists of a park on of land, containing 184 benches, one dedicated to each victim. The benches are aligned along the line of Flight 77 according to the victims' ages, from 3 to 71. The park opened to the public on 11 September 2008.  Hall of Heroes  The Hall of Heroes on the main concourse On the building's main concourse is the Hall of Heroes, opened 1968 and dedicated to the more than 3,460 recipients of the Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military decoration.DoD Award Manual, 23 November 2010, 1348. 33, P. 31, 8. c.

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a squaregraph is a type of undirected graph that can be drawn in the plane in such a way that every bounded face is a quadrilateral and every vertex with three or fewer neighbors is incident to an unbounded face. Related graph classes The squaregraphs include as special cases trees, grid graphs, gear graphs, and the graphs of polyominos. As well as being planar graphs, squaregraphs are median graphs, meaning that for every three vertices u, v, and w there is a unique median vertex m(u,v,w) that lies on shortest paths between each pair of the three vertices.. See for a discussion of planar median graphs more generally. As with median graphs more generally, squaregraphs are also partial cubes: their vertices can be labeled with binary strings such that the Hamming distance between strings is equal to the shortest path distance between vertices. The graph obtained from a squaregraph by making a vertex for each zone (an equivalence class of parallel edges of quadrilaterals) and an edge for each two zones that meet in a quadrilateral is a circle graph determined by a triangle-free chord diagram of the unit disk. Characterization Squaregraphs may be characterized in several ways other than via their planar embeddings:. *They are the median graphs that do not contain as an induced subgraph any member of an infinite family of forbidden graphs. These forbidden graphs are the cube (the simplex graph of K3), the Cartesian product of an edge and a claw K1,3 (the simplex graph of a claw), and the graphs formed from a gear graph by adding one more vertex connected to the hub of the wheel (the simplex graph of the disjoint union of a cycle with an isolated vertex). *They are the graphs that are connected and bipartite, such that (if an arbitrary vertex r is picked as a root) every vertex has at most two neighbors closer to r, and such that at every vertex v, the link of v (a graph with a vertex for each edge incident to v and an edge for each 4-cycle containing v) is either a cycle of length greater than three or a disjoint union of paths. *They are the dual graphs of arrangements of lines in the hyperbolic plane that do not have three mutually-crossing lines. Algorithms The characterization of squaregraphs in terms of distance from a root and links of vertices can be used together with breadth first search as part of a linear time algorithm for testing whether a given graph is a squaregraph, without any need to use the more complex linear-time algorithms for planarity testing of arbitrary graphs. Several algorithmic problems on squaregraphs may be computed more efficiently than in more general planar or median graphs; for instance, and present linear time algorithms for computing the diameter of squaregraphs, and for finding a vertex minimizing the maximum distance to all other vertices.

He was born on 8 July 1871 at Bhawanipur in Calcutta, in a well to do Brahmin family. Early experiences with sorrows and tribulations in life and human misery inspired him to develop a spiritual outlook. He developed friendship with Satishchandra Mukherjee, who was in his later years a patriot and a scholar and together started a school for imparting knowledge of Indian scriptures and Sanskrit education. The aim of the school was spread noble ideas among student community. They also started a monthly magazine, named as Dawn and Ajay became its first editor. In 1897 Ajay inspired his friend Satishchandra to start the Dawn Society. The journal Dawn had made a lot of contribution to national education and to the freedom movement.

Meeting with Vivekananda Ajay first met Vivekananda after the latter's return to India, in April‚ÄìMay 1897, in Nilambar Mukherjee's Garden House in Belur. He met the Swami several times, before the latter initiated him into the monastic order. According to Swami Swarupananda's diary, he was initiated into the vow of renunciation on 29 March 1898, Tuesday. Advaita Ashrama and Prabuddha Bharata: Contributions Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati Swarupananda was married early in his youth but continued to live as a Brahmachari or celibate at his parents' home in Calcutta. After three or four visits to the Belur Math, he decided to leave home and become a full-time disciple of Vivekananda, and within a few days of his stay at the Math, he was initiated into the monastic order, (sanyas), by Vivekananda on 29 March 1898. Meanwhile, John Henry Sevier who had earlier come in contact with Vivekananda during his visit to London and become his disciple, travelled to India with Vivekananda, along with his wife Charlotte. Sevier, with the help of Swarupananda, found an old tea estate suitable for the Ashram, at Mayavati, near Almora in July 1898. Soon the land was purchased and construction commenced.Mayawati Route ‚Äì Visitors Booklet of Advaita Ashrama Advaita Ashrama. The Advaita Ashrama had its formal opening on 19 March 1899, which happened to be the birth anniversary of Ramakrishna (Hindu calendar), that year, with Swarupananda its first head upon its opening. Sister Nivedita had become a monastic disciple of Vivekananda when she took sanyas four days prior to Swarupananda at Belur, in March‚ÄìApril 1898. Swarupananda taught her Bengali and Hindu religious literature every day. Later at Almora under his guidance she started reading the Bhagavad Gita. The publication of Prabuddha Bharata, the Official Journal of the Ramakrishna Order was halted abruptly due to the death of its editor B. R. Rajam Iyer, who was only twenty-four years old, on 13 May 1898 in Chennai. Vivekananda, who was then resting at Almora, asked Sevier and his wife to revive the magazine. The next issue of the magazine was published from Thompson house in Almora town in August 1898 with Swarupananda as its editor, then in 1899 it shifted base with the opening of the ashram in a secluded hilly region in Mayavati, near Almora.Prabuddha Bharata Advaita Ashrama website. During his editorship, Prabuddha Bharata became a powerful medium for disseminating ideals of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and earned much appreciation from the intellectuals. Vivekananda had also praised Swarupananda's work in one of his letters. Swarupananda became the president of the Mayavati ashrama. He was very close to Captain and Mrs. Sevier. The most memorable event during his tenure was the visit of Vivekananda to Mayavati in January 1901, after his return from his second visit to the West. He discussed about his ideas of the work to be carried out from the Ashrama with Swarupananda. Swarupananda was keen to work for the upliftment of the tribal and the poor people in the region. He initiated education of hill people in modern methods of cultivation to address their acute poverty and shortage of food. He established two schools, one in Mayavati and the other in the village of Shore for the local children. He also started a charitable dispensary which even today serves the people of the region. He also arranged to teach Hindi and English to the tribal employees of the Ashrama. He would travel to Nainital, Almora and other places to spread both secular and spiritual knowledge among local people. In 1899 he worked to provide relief to the local people who were affected by a terrible famine in the Kishangarh area, near Jaipur. There he worked with Swami Kalyanananda, his brother disciple. He also begged from door to door in Nainital for Swami Kalyanananda to enable him to serve the old and sick monks and poor people in Haridwar and Rishikesh. In 1902 he went to Allahabad for giving lectures on Vedanta and inspired the local people to start a permanent centre there. In 1905 when the Dharmashala region was hit by a severe earthquake, Swarupananda collected funds for the relief work and directed the work. He was regular in his spiritual practices and austerities, apart from the various secular activities that kept him engaged. he built a hut near the ashrama which came to be known as Swarupananda hut, for the purpose of meditating in seclusion. He worked among youth and students to spread the message of Vivekananda. He was also invited by His Highness of Baroda to preach Vedanta, together with Swami Vivekananda. But Vivekananda could not come owing to his ill health. Another important project in which Swarupananda worked was collection and publication of Swami Vivekananda's works, but he could not finish it owing to his short lifespan. As a distinguished scholar he wrote several articles in Prabuddha Bharata and strongly rebutted the criticisms of a certain Professor Fraser on Vivekananda in Hindustan Review magazine. He authored the translation of Bhagavad Gita in English. Last days The location of Mayavati however didn't suit Swarupananda well, as the constant uphill and downhill of Mayavati terrain, took a toll on his heart. In November 1901 he was recuperating in Calcutta with Vivekananda;Letter to Sister Nivedita The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 9, Letters ‚Äì Fifth Series/CCVII Margo, 12 November 1901. while he continued to edit the magazine and run the ashram for another six years until his 1906 death in Nainital. He suffered from pneumonia after being drenched by rain while travelling to Nainital and died on 27 June 1906. His obituary in Prabuddha Bharata was written by Sister Nivedita.

He was a republican in politics and fought on the Parliamentary side in the English Civil War. Life Richard Salway was the son of Humphrey Salwey of Stanford Court at Stanford- on-Teme, Worcestershire and his wife Anne Littleton, daughter of Sir Edward Littleton and Mary Fisher of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire. His father was a lawyer and MP for Worcestershire. Salwey became a grocer and merchant in London. Salwey's father was active in the parliamentary cause, and Salwey became a major in the Parliamentarian army. In 1645, he was elected Member of Parliament for Appleby. He made his name in parliamentary affairs as member of the commissions on Irish matters. In 1647 he travelled with Sir Thomas Wharton, Sir Robert King, Sir John Clotworthy, and Sir Robert Meredith to negotiate with the Duke of Ormond.Toby Christopher Barnard, Jane Fenlon, The Dukes of Ormonde, 1610-1745 (2000), p. 91. He was a commissioner for the Tender of Union in 1651. The beginning of the First Anglo-Dutch War saw a shake-up of the naval organisation, after defeat at the Battle of Dungeness, and with Henry Vane and George Thomson, Salwey and his ally John Carew made up the group of four effectively overseeing the Navy for Parliament.Blair Worden, The Rump Parliament 1648-1653(1974), p. 314. Salwey was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, but broke with him at the end of the Rump Parliament, together with Francis Allen.Blair Worden, The Rump Parliament 1648-1653 (1974), p. 336. He was a member of Barebone's Parliament, nominated for Worcestershire. He clashed with Cromwell in April 1653; and he lost his Navy position at the end of the year in a general Admiralty change.E. B. Fryde, D. E. Greenway, S. Porter, I. Roy, Handbook of British Chronology (1996), p. 142. He was appointed to the new Council of State formed after the Rump was dissolved, but boycotted its meetings.Austin Woolrych, p. 156. Salwey was one of a number of radical puritans who had a house in Clapham, Surrey during the late 1640s and early 1650s. He also returned to Clapham in 1683 for the last two years of his life.http://www.claphamhistorian.com He was out of the country as English ambassador in Constantinople, appointed by the Lord Protector on 14 August 1654. He begged to excused the duty on 8 February 1655, and never left England. In 1659 Salwey was active again in parliament as a member of the restored Rump parliament. He became a member of committee of the Committee of Safety and Council of State, in May of that year, and a commissioner for the Navy. The Committee sent him with Sir Henry Vane as heads of a delegation to John Lawson, a refractory republican Vice-Admiral, without success. On 16 January 1660 he with William Sydenham was expelled from Parliament; he was sent to the Tower of London. After the Restoration he was suspected of complicity in the Farnley Wood Plot, in 1663‚Äì64. Salwey married in 1641 Anne Waring, the daughter of Richard Waring, grocer and a London alderman involved in the Levant Company. He had the resources to build a country house at Haye Park in Shropshire, and his residence is often given as the neighbouring Richard‚Äôs Castle, over the county boundary in Herefordshire; his son of the same name then built nearby at Moor Park.J.

Please use in that order.\\" Concepts and phrases evolve and are applied in new ways. The \\"four boxes\\" phrase always includes the ballot, jury, and cartridge (or ammo) boxes. Additional boxes, when specified, have sometimes been the bandbox, soapbox, moving box, or lunch box. The phrase in various forms has been used in arguments about tariff abolition, the rights of African Americans, women's suffrage, environmentalism, and gun control. The soap box represents exercising one's right to freedom of speech to influence politics to defend liberty. The ballot box represents exercising one's right to vote to elect a government which defends liberty. The jury box represents using jury nullification to refuse to convict someone being prosecuted for breaking an unjust law that decreases liberty. The cartridge box represents exercising one's right to keep and bear arms to oppose, in armed conflict, a government that decreases liberty. The four boxes (in that order) represent increasingly forceful (and increasingly controversial) methods of political action. Origins Stephen Decatur Miller may have originated the concept during a speech at Stateburg, South Carolina in September 1830. He said \\"There are three and only three ways to reform our Congressional legislation, familiarly called, the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box\\". This became his campaign slogan in his successful bid for the Senate on a platform advocating the abolition of tariffs. An 1849 edition of the Family Favorite and Temperance Journal extended the concept: \\"Four boxes govern the world:‚Äîcartridge box, ballot box, jury box, and band box\\". The bandbox, originally designed to hold collar bands, was used to carry the elaborate women's hats of the time as well as many other personal items. The quip was reproduced in the 25 December 1869 edition of the Spirit of the Times newspaper and in the 1881 Treasury of wisdom, wit and humor, odd comparisons and proverbs. William F. Butler, an African-American leader, used the concept in a speech he delivered in November 1867 in Lexington, Kentucky, saying: \\"First we had the cartridge box, now we want the ballot box, and soon we will get the jury box\\". Butler was referring to the fact that African Americans had fought in the U.S. military in the American Civil War, but were still facing opposition to being treated as full citizens. Frederick Douglass (1818‚Äì1895) A version that is close to the modern forms was introduced by Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave who became an influential public figure in the Union States and United Kingdom before the U.S. Civil War, and had a long and distinguished career after the war. In a speech delivered on 15 November 1867, Douglass said \\"A man's rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box and the cartridge box. Let no man be kept from the ballot box because of his color. Let no woman be kept from the ballot box because of her sex\\". In Douglass's autobiography the Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, published in 1892, he described his conviction that a freedman should become more than just a freedman, and should become a citizen. He repeated that \\"the liberties of the American people were dependent upon the ballot-box, the jury-box, and the cartridge-box; that without these no class of people could live and flourish in this country...\\" The Altamont Enterprise revived the old saw of the cartridge box, ballot box and bandbox in 1909 when reporting a discussion between the newspaper editor Horace Greeley and the early campaigner for women's rights, Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Greeley proposed that the bullet box and ballot box went together, and asked Stanton if she would be prepared to fight if she had the vote. Stanton retorted that she would fight as he did, with her pen. The article went on to describe the case of Abigail Hopper Gibbons, who as a landowner and taxpayer was sent an official form asking her to give reasons why she was not eligible for jury duty. She replied, \\"I know of none\\". However, at this time women were barred from the jury box, the ballot box and the cartridge box. Some women rejected the feminist position. The anti-suffragette Emily Bissell saw involvement in the boxes of liberty as inappropriate for women. She wrote \\"The vote is part of man's work. Ballot- box, cartridge box, jury box, sentry box all go together in his part of life. Women cannot step in and take the responsibilities and duties of voting without assuming his place very largely\\". Commentary Akhil Reed Amar, who introduced the \\"lunch box\\" concept In a commentary on Leonard Levy's book Origins of the Bill of Rights (1999), Professor Brian C. Kalt of the Michigan State University College of Law argues that the saying simply expresses the intent of the United States Bill of Rights to enshrine and protect the popular sovereignty. It succinctly defines the four methods by which the people can stand up for their rights. Taking a less positive view of the idea, in April 2010 the Anti-Defamation League noted that it is frequently used by anti- government extremists to justify violence to gain their ends on the grounds that all else has failed, and cites a typical comment on the Pat Dollard Web Site: \\"we've tried the soap box & the ballot box to no avail. Maybe it's time to start thinking INSIDE the box ‚Äì the bullet box\\". In their book For the People: What the Constitution Really Says About Your Rights, Akhil Reed Amar and Alan Hirsch introduce a variation on the theme. Discussing the American Constitution, they assert that the ideal of citizenship generates four \\"boxes\\" of rights. The first three are the familiar ballot box, jury box and cartridge box. To these, with some reservations, they add the lunch box: the idea of a social safety net that supports basic physical and educational needs. Modern usage James G. Watt, United States Secretary of the Interior 1981‚Äì1983 Time Magazine reported that the saying was used in September 1976 by a keynote speaker at a convention of the American Independent Party, a coalition of right-wing forces. Although delegates disagreed on some issues, including the extent to which the U.S. should be active in foreign affairs, all agreed with the saying. During a March 1991 dinner event organized by the Green River Cattlemen's Association in Wyoming, James G. Watt said, \\"If the troubles from environmentalists cannot be solved in the jury box or at the ballot box, perhaps the cartridge box should be used.\\" Larry McDonald, a politician from Georgia and former president of the John Birch Society has also been quoted, omitting the caution to use bullets as the last resort: \\"We have four boxes with which to defend our freedom: the soap box, the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box\\". The term is used in newspaper articles, and has been used in a petition to the Supreme Court of California. \\"Four boxes\\" and derivatives have been used in the name of various websites that espouse patriotism and the right to bear arms.

The channel was officially launched on 26 October at 7:00 pm U.A.E. time.MBC MAX new channel to complement MBC2  mbc Group  AMEinfo.com Its first film was Spider-Man.  Content As mentioned earlier, MBC Max shows films with milder content than MBC 2, which means MBC Max may not show horror films and other related genres. The channel does not show any film that contains extreme forms of violence. MBC Max even has slightly more censorship than MBC 2, but mostly with the audio simply to remove the majority of a certain film's bad language, as well as bigger cuts of other censored and sexual scenes. MBC Max also features MBC 3 prints of animated and family films, always broadcasting in the middle of the afternoon U.A.E. time, as these films feature the same MBC 3-based, higher-level censorship. (This only applies to films that were originally on MBC 3, as the animated and family films that premiered on MBC Max did not feature such censorship, even though many of those films later appeared on MBC 3, unsurprisingly featuring censorship.) Despite MBC Max's reputation for broadcasting mild films, it does however broadcast certain R-rated films, such as dramas and comedies like Me, Myself & Irene, albeit the audio was heavily edited since the film contained strong language. It is only important that films do not feature extreme visual violence, and sexual themes are mostly censored anyway. This limit, however, is lifted in MBC Max's new dubbed films package. Additionally, MBC Max broadcasts classical films more often than MBC 2, since the majority of Hollywood films from the 1960s and before are considered mild by today's standards.

Influenced by the German Bauhaus school, many Danish designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production. Prominent examples are the Egg chair, the PH lamps and the Sydney Opera House (Australia).  History  The Danish Culture Canon credits Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll (1846‚Äì1908) with early contributions to design in the areas of ceramics, jewellery, bookbinding, silver and furniture although he is known in the rest of the world for creating the Carlsberg logo (1904), still in use today.. The Canon also includes Knud V. Engelhardt (1882‚Äì1931) for a more industrial approach, especially in the rounded contours of his electric tramcar designs which were widely copied.. In the area of textiles, Marie Gudme Leth (1895‚Äì1997) brought the screen printing process to Denmark, opening a factory in 1935 which allowed her colourful patterns to be manufactured on an industrial basis.. August Sandgren introduced functionalism in the design of his masterful bookbindings. Wishbone Chair are representative of the movement's aesthetic In the late 1940s, shortly after the end of the Second World War, conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but architecture, silver, ceramics, glass and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's late industrialisation combined with a tradition of high-quality craftsmanship formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production. After the end of the war, Europeans were keen to find novel approaches such as the light wood furniture from Denmark. Last but not least, support in Denmark for freedom of individual expression assisted the cause.. The newly established Furniture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Art played a considerable part in the development of furniture design. Kaare Klint taught functionalism based on the size and proportions of objects, wielding considerable influence. Hans J. Wegner, who had been trained as a cabinetmaker, contributed with a unique sense of form, especially in designing chairs.. As head of the cooperative FDB furniture design studio, B√∏rge Mogensen designed simple and robust objects of furniture for the average Danish family. Finn Juhl demonstrated an individualistic approach in designing chairs with an appealing but functional look. In the early 1950s, American design also influenced Danish furniture. The American Charles Eames designed and manufactured chairs of moulded wood and steel pipes. These encouraged Arne Jacobsen to design his worldfamous Ant Chair, Denmark's first industrially manufactured chair. Furthermore, as Shaker furniture‚Äîand especially its reputation for stripped down chairs‚Äîbegan to be more and more known abroad, it also influenced Danish designers.Taft, Maggie, \\"Morphologies and Genealogies; Shaker Furniture and Danish Design,\\" Design and Culture 7:3, 313‚Äì334. Poul Kj√¶rholm, Verner Panton and Nanna Ditzel followed a few years later, continuing the successful story of Danish design. Kj√¶rholm worked mainly in steel and leather, Panton left Denmark during the 1960s to continue designing imaginative but highly unconventional plastic chairs while Nanna Ditzel, who also had a strongly individualistic approach, was successful in helping to renew Danish furniture design in the 1980s.  Modern trends  Bernadotte's thermos jug, 2004 During the 1970s, Verner Panton made some of his most important designs, including the Pantonova and the 1-2-3 System. Danish furniture design during the 1980s did not include prominent contributions. By contrast, industrial designers began to prosper, making use of principles such as focus on the user, as well as attention to materials and to detail. For example, there are well known Danish designers, like Tobias Jacobsen (the grandson of Arne Jacobsen), who focused on the single elements of a violin when creating his chair \\"Vio\\" or on a boomerang when designing his eponymous sideboard.. The Bernadotte & Bj√∏rn studio, established in 1950, was the first to specialise in industrial design, with an emphasis on office machines, domestic appliances and functional articles such as the thermos jug. The electronics manufacturer Bang & Olufsen, in collaboration with Bernadotte & Bj√∏rn and later with Jacob Jensen and David Lewis, went on to excel in modern design work. Around the same time, the Stelton company collaborated with Arne Jacobsen and Erik Magnussen to produce their iconic vacuum jug, a huge international success. Another successful design field is medical technology. Danish design companies like 3PART, Designit and CBD have worked in this area with individual designers such as Steve McGugan and Anders Smith. In 2002 the Danish Government and the City of Copenhagen launched an effort to establish a world event for design in Copenhagen. Originally understood as a tool for branding traditional Danish design, the non-profit organization INDEX: shifted focus after worldwide research and coined the concept of Design to Improve Life, which rapidly became celebrated in Denmark and around the world. The organization now hands out the biggest design award in the world biannual in Copenhagen, tours large scale outdoor exhibition around the world, run educational program as well as design labs and hosts a global network. Today, there is strong focus on design in Denmark as industry increasingly appreciates the importance of design in the business environment. In addition, as part of its trade and industry policy, the Danish government has launched the DesignDenmark initiative which aims to restore Denmark to the international design elite..  Architecture  alt= Modern architecture has also contributed to the concept of Danish design. √Örhus City Hall, √Örhus, Denmark Arne Jacobsen was not just a furniture designer but one of the leading architects of his times. Among his achievements are the Bellevue Theater and restaurant, Klampenborg (1936), the √Örhus City Hall (with Erik M√∏ller; 1939‚Äì42) and the SAS Royal Hotel (1958‚Äì60). J√∏rn Utzon (1918‚Äì2008), Denmark's most widely recognized architect, is remembered for his expressionist Sydney Opera House (1966) and the later Bagsv√¶rd Church (1976) with its wavy concrete roof.. Henning Larsen (b. 1925) is the architect who designed the boldly modern Copenhagen Opera House on the island of Holmen which was completed in 2005.. Danish architecture is currently in a new-wave era, not receiving more attention since the golden age of Arne Jacobsen and J√∏rn Utzon, being focused on function and concept rather than aesthetics and an impeccable finish.https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/unge-arkitektkometer-saetter- danmark-paa-verdenskortet Bjarke Ingels of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and Dan Stubbergaard's architectural firm Cobe who met at the former drawing office Plot,https://www.berlingske.dk/karriere/koebenhavn-er-stjernearkitektens- afsaet-til-international-succes are both part of the new wave.

Among recent highlights are: * The Museum of Modern Art in New York has chosen to outfit 95% of its new Yoshio Taniguchi-designed home with furniture by Danish design company GUBI. * The Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar... * The Evita Peroni suite of women's accessories which now has some 300 stores in 30 countries.. * The Halifax Central Library in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, was designed by the Danish architectural firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen. After it was completed in 2014, it has received widespread acclaim and several architecture awards.  Designers  Among the most successful designers associated with the concept are B√∏rge Mogensen (1914‚Äì72), Finn Juhl (1912‚Äì89), Hans Wegner (1914‚Äì2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902‚Äì71), Poul Kj√¶rholm (1929‚Äì80), Poul Henningsen (1894‚Äì1967) and Verner Panton (1926‚Äì98). Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923‚Äì2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Harald Quistgaard (1919‚Äì2008) for kitchen furniture and implements, Gertrud Vasegaard (1913‚Äì2007) for ceramics, and Ole Wanscher (1903‚Äì85), who had a classical approach to furniture design.  Museums  * The Danish Museum of Art & Design in Copenhagen exhibits many of the artifacts associated with Danish design, especially furniture. * The New York Museum of Modern Art also has a large Danish design collection.. * The Danish Design Centre in the centre of Copenhagen has both permanent and special exhibitions promoting Danish design.

The counter was run by a nonprofit membership organization called the Linux Counter Project. The organization was created on 1 May 1999, taking over the running of the counter from Harald Tveit Alvestrand, who had been running the project since 1993. In 2011, it was taken over by Christin L√∂hner, who did a complete rewrite of the code. On 10 December 2018, Christin announced that the project would end, citing lack of time and user interest.  Purpose of Linux Counter  The Linux Counter was started \\"for fun\\" with the goal to estimate the number of Linux users there are worldwide. The project invited users to register themselves as being a Linux user and then used various statistical heuristics to estimate the number of Linux users who did not register and the total number of Linux users worldwide. The project initially tracked the number of Linux users, but later extended to statistics on Linux users, the machines they use, software they use and in what part of the world Linux users actually lived. A second purpose of the Linux Counter was to help Linux users to find each other. The Linux Counter was reporting Linux users in almost any place in the world. If Linux users set their information to be public, one could easily find those users; Linux users could, for example, find other Linux users who lived somewhere near them.  Attention paid to the Counter  At the time when Linux first burst into the limelight (around 1999), there were quite a few news articles about the Linux Counter, including three Slashdot articles (the first two of which caused so much interest that it overloaded the counter). Linux Today reported how Microsoft Austria used the site for spamming Linux users; the counter kept a list of press references, occasionally updated.  New Linux Counter  As of 2011 the original Linux Counter has been superseded by a new and re-written version linuxcounter.net, by Christin L√∂hner (formerly Mieland), which has since been Slashdotted.

The tracking and location of an ocean-going vessel (the Italian liner SS Rex) by B-17 Flying Fortresses on 12 May 1938 was a major event in the development of a doctrine that led to a United States Air Force independent of the Army.Shiner, (1997, p. 133. The mission was ostensibly a training exercise for coastal defense of the United States, but was conceived by planners to be a well-publicized demonstration of the capabilities of \\"heavy bombers (as) long range instruments of power\\". The flight was conducted during coastal defense maneuvers held by the Air Corps without the participation of the United States Navy, and apparently without understanding of their purpose by the Army Chief of Staff.Correll, \\"Rendezvous with the Rex\\", p. 55. Both had continuing disagreements with the leaders of the Air Corps over roles and missions, with the Navy disputing its maritime mission and the Army seeking to limit its role to that of supporting ground forces.Shiner (1997), p. 116. With a characteristic flair for creating publicity,Shiner (1997), p. 147.Underwood (1991), p. 4. the Air Corps' General Headquarters Air Force (its combat organization) not only successfully made the interception at sea, but exploited both live radio news coverage and dramatic photographs. Although the publicity resulted in a short-term setback for Air Corps ambitions, within a year both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and future Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall became new proponents of long-range air power.Underwood (1991), pp. 6, 117, 146.Head (1995), p. 209.Roosevelt was especially impressed by the range of the B-17. (Underwood 146) BackgroundOstfriesland= In July 1921, promoting the concept of an independent Air Force, Gen. Billy Mitchell staged a series of aerial bombing exercises that resulted in the sinking of the former German battleship Ostfriesland by the U.S. Air Service. Although he incurred the enmity of the Navy, which considered the achievement nothing more than a publicity stunt, Mitchell continued to discredit the value of the battleship as the main weapon for projection of power by sinking several more obsolete ships in the next two years.The others were the obsolete U.S. pre-dreadnought battleships Alabama in September, 1921, and Virginia and New Jersey in September, 1923. However the Air Service was limited by Army policy to being an auxiliary of the ground forces and was unable to obtain a role that would employ the use of long distance bombers.Correll, \\"Billy Mitchell and the Battleships \\", pp. 65-68 =The \\"Shasta Disaster\\"= When the Air Service was renamed the Air Corps in 1926, the Joint Army-Navy Board was in the process of reconsidering service responsibilities in coastal defense. Both Chief of Air Corps Major General Mason Patrick and Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, resisted any restrictions on range or missions for their respective services' aircraft. The resulting Joint Action statement was vague regarding Air Corps actions over water but \\"left the door open\\" for the Navy's interpretation of its own authority, which was that the shore-based coastal patrol mission was its prerogative. Efforts by the War Department to clarify the issue were rebuffed by the Navy to the extent that the Secretary of War warned President Herbert Hoover in 1930 that the situation was endangering national defense.Greer (1985), p. 68 On 7 January 1931, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Navy CNO Adm. William V. Pratt reached an agreement modifying the Joint Action statement by assigning the coastal defense role for land-based aircraft to the Air Corps.Greer (1985), p. 69Tate (1998), p. 78. This came at a time when the Air Corps was seeking a mission to justify the development of all- metal monoplane bombers, and theorists at the Air Corps Tactical School were advocating the use of long-range heavy bombers. In August of that year, to garner publicity and generate favorable public opinion, Lt.Col. Frank M. Andrews, on the staff of outgoing Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. James Fechet, proposed to bomb another ship during joint maneuvers with the Navy off the coast of North Carolina. Before the mission Col. Roy Kirtland, the base commander at Langley Field, cautioned reporters that the operation was to be only a bombing exercise using small bombs, and that \\"nothing spectacular\\" should be expected.Maurer (1987), p. 228. Keystone B-3A The United States Shipping Board made available a World War I cargo ship, the 4865 gross ton USS Mount Shasta, that had been tied up in the James River for a decade. An Army mine vessel towed the hulk to sea off Currituck Beach Light. The next morning, 11 August, Major Harbert A. Dargue led nine B-3A and B-5 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group, little different from the Martin NBS-1s that had destroyed the Ostfriesland,Tate (1998), p. 158. to locate and attack the Mount Shasta, but a combination of bad weather and failed communications resulted in the planes being unable to locate the ship. Worse, the failure was witnessed by several dozen reporters, movie newsreel crews, a broadcast team from NBC radio, and observers from both the Army and Navy, some aboard airplanes that did find the ship. The Navy responded immediately with scornful public mocking of the effort. When a second attempt three days later scored only a few hits with inadequately small 300- and 600-pound bombs, and failed to sink the Mount Shasta, a pair of United States Coast Guard ocean-going tugboats used small guns to sink it.Green \\"The Shasta Disaster\\" Despite its earlier disclaimer and subsequent explanations, the Air Corps was highly embarrassed by the incident, referred to as \\"the bombing flop\\" within the service. Navy Captain Dudley Knox dubbed it \\"the Shasta Disaster\\", and the New York Evening Post commented that \\"the Navy evened up an old score\\". Hanson W. Baldwin, military editor of the New York Times and a Naval Academy graduate, averred that it was \\"illustrative of the inefficiency of land-based pilots over water.\\"Huston (2002), p. 26 As a result, Andrews and six subordinates were replaced by incoming Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. Benjamin Foulois, and the Secretary of War recommended that the Air Corps' budget be slashed. Andrews and Lt.Col. Henry H. Arnold (executive officer of the Air Materiel Division at Wright Field), however, expressed concerns about the apparent lack of capability and possible failures in Air Corps training demonstrated by the fiasco. Two months later a second opportunity presented itself. Another old ship, the Haines, sank in shallow water while being towed off Plum Tree Island and became a hazard to navigation. The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air, even though their only visible target was a ten- foot-square float marker. This accomplishment, however, went entirely unpublicized.Maurer (1987), p. 229. Regardless of the MacArthur‚ÄìPratt agreement, the Navy had gone ahead with development of land-based patrol aircraft and expansion of its naval air stations, and in 1933 formally repudiated the agreement after Adm. Pratt retired.Maurer (1987), p. 289. On 11 September 1935, the Joint Board, at the behest of the Navy and the concurrence of Gen. MacArthur, issued a revised Joint Action statement that reasserted the limited role of all Air Corps missions, including coastal defense, as auxiliary to the \\"mobile Army\\".Cate (1945), p. 15. However, long-range bomber advocates interpreted its language to mean that the Air Corps could conduct long-range reconnaissance, attack approaching fleets, reinforce distant bases, and attack enemy air bases, all in furtherance of its mission to prevent an air attack on America.Cate (1945), p. 16. =Joint Air Exercise No. 4= Boeing YB-17. By the time of the interception, the bombers were redesignated B-17s. On 4 March 1937, the 2nd Bombardment Group, now commanded by Lt. Col. Robert Olds, received the first of the newly developed B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers,Underwood (1991), p. 87. with 12 delivered during the spring and summer of 1937. Designated the YB-17 because of its prototype status, the Flying Fortress was the first multi-engine long-range bomber acquired by the Air Corps, despite resistance from the Army General Staff over its necessity, and the centerpiece of the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force).Shiner (1997), p. 144, 149.Cate (1945), p. 17. The B-17s made their first significant operational contribution during Joint Air Exercise No. 4, an Army‚ÄìNavy summer maneuver conducted at sea west of San Francisco, California.Head (1995), p. 192 and 195. Authorized by a directive of President Roosevelt issued 10 July 1937, the exercise used the target ship Utah to represent a hostile fleet of two battleships, an aircraft carrier, and nine destroyers. A patrol wing of 30 Navy planes commanded by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King was assigned to locate the fleet, after which a force of 41 Air Corps bombers (including seven B-17s operating from March Field) would attack it. War Department orders limited the Air Corps aircraft to operating no more than offshore, even though the directive had specified an exercise area out to .Maurer (1987), p. 409. The exercise began at noon on 12 August 1937 and was scheduled to end in 24 hours. After several hours of searching through a foggy undercast that extended offshore, Navy planes found the Utah from the coast and tracked it heading northwest. Air Corps bombers were sent to attack the ship but searched well into the evening without locating it. Admiral King then found an error in the Navy's position reports, which he later attributed to \\"clerical error\\".Maurer (1987), p. 405.Underwood (1991), p. 92, however, states that the Navy \\"deceived\\" the Air Corps. The Utah had actually been west of the search area provided to the Air Corps. Worse, the ship disappeared into the extensive low fog during the night, breaking the contact by the Navy's scout planes. The poor weather also prevented an early morning search for the Utah. Brig. Gen. Delos Emmons, commander of the GHQ Air Force's 1st Wing, dispatched bombers at 0900 on 13 August to search an area of entirely covered by low clouds.Tate (1998), p. 168. Olds surmised that the Utah had feinted towards San Francisco, then reversed course to attack the industrial Los Angeles area. Accompanied by Maj. Gen. Frank Andrews (commanding the GHQ Air Force), he flew in the lead B-17 above the clouds, patrolling an area offshore. A Navy patrol aircraft located the Utah at 11:00 steaming southeast off the coast. The 2nd BG bombers responded to the position report and located the Utah shortly before the noon termination of the exercise. From an altitude of 400 feet they attacked the former battleship with Navy-supplied water bombs.Copp, A Few Great Captains, p. 396. When the Navy protested the low- altitude attack, claiming that evasive action could have avoided the attack, both B-17s and B-18s repeated the mission the next day. They found the Utah and bombed it, with the B-17s bombing from 18,000 feet.Underwood (1991), p. 91.Head (1995), p. 195. The Air Corps produced photographs and bombing data that showed it achieved a higher percentage of hits and near-misses than earlier Navy tests,Underwood (1991), p. 92. and the Navy subsequently had the exercise classified \\"Secret\\".LeMay and Kantor (1965), p. 151. The joint report sent to the president by the secretaries of the Navy and War omitted the information showing the success both in navigation and bombing.Underwood (1991), p. 93. Despite the secrecy restriction, the success of the B-17s was leaked to radio commentator Boake Carter, who disclosed it to the public.Copp, A Few Great Captains, p. 398. In an attempt to overcome this compartmentalization, Andrews bypassed the chain of command on 8 January 1938,Underwood (1991), p. 205 note 33. in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's military aide, Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming the accuracy of the Army's bombing.Underwood (1991), p. 97 and note previously cited. Intercepting the RexNortheast Maneuvers= In May 1938 the Air Corps conducted one of the largest maneuvers in its history.Copp, Andrews, p. 14.Copp, p. 14, called it \\"the largest.\\" All three wing headquarters, seven group headquarters, and nine complete squadrons participated. The largest previous assemblage was that of the \\"1st Provisional Air Division\\" at Wright Field in May 1931, where 667 aircraft, participants from every squadron but one based in the continental United States, and flights from all 19 National Guard observation squadrons gathered, but only 1,440 personnel. (Air Corps News Letter 5 June 1931, Vol. XV No. 7, pp. 190-195) 468 officers, 2,380 enlisted men, and 131 aircraft were drawn from all three wings of the GHQ Air ForceZamzow (2008), p. 46.Maurer (1987), p. 402. and based at 18 airports in the northeast United States, \\"from Schenectady, New York, and Aberdeen, Maryland, westward to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\\".Correll, \\"Rendezvous with the Rex\\", p. 54. Included were eight B-17s of the 2d Bombardment Group.All personnel, aircraft, and unit statistics for the Northeast Maneuvers were specified in an announcement in the Air Corps News Letter (1 May 1938) Vol. XXI No. 9, p. 11. The 131 aircraft, in addition to the B-17s, were: 44 A-17 and 12 A-18 attack planes, 34 B-18 bombers, 15 PB-2 and P-26 pursuit planes, 2 C-36 transports, and an OA-8 amphibian. Also, the ACNL referred to the 2nd Group's bombers as \\"B-17\\", and this article follows suit. All were assigned as the \\"Blue Force\\" defending New England from the \\"Black Force\\", an attacking aircraft carrier fleet.Head (1995), p. 202. The Navy, involved in fleet exercises off the West Coast, did not provide ships to play the role of the Black Force. The Army publicized the resulting scenario as depicting simultaneous attacks on America by hostile fleets on both coasts, with the Air Corps tasked to defend against one of them.Underwood (1991), p. 112. Ira C. Eaker Attached to the exercise was Lt. Col. Ira C. Eaker, the Chief of the Air Corps' Information Division.In 1938 \\"Information\\" was a term for Military Intelligence, not public relations. Eaker, who had a degree in journalism and had just completed a course in news photography at the University of Oklahoma, used the maneuvers as a platform for publicizing both the capabilities and materiel deficiencies of the Air Corps. His assistant was 2d Lt. Harris Hull, a reservist on temporary duty for the exercise who was a reporter for the Washington Post in civilian life. When newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, criticized the maneuvers for using a \\"mythical fleet\\" as a target,Underwood (1991), p. 114. Hull suggested that an ocean liner be substituted for naval vessels. He learned that the Italian Line's SS Rex was bound for New York and would pass the mark on 11 May. Eaker recommended the interception of the liner to Gen. Andrews, who concurred and received approval from the office of the Army's Chief of Staff. Hull arranged to receive position reports from officials of the line. Olds, whose B-17s were deployed to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, was given the assignment of locating the Rex as far at sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy, the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron, to act as nominal head of the Black Force. Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission. On the afternoon of 11 May 1937, Olds and his crews flew from Olmsted to the staging base at Mitchel Field on Long Island. Assigned as lead navigator was 1st Lt. Curtis E. LeMay, who had navigated the finding of the Utah and been a participant in a goodwill mission to South America in February that had won the group the MacKay Trophy.Jablonski (1965), p. 17, text and photograph. The Chief of the Materiel Division's Photographic Section, Maj. George W. Goddard, flew co-pilot in aircraft No. 81 to document the mission using a specially-modified Graflex camera. Reporters were also invited to accompany the mission. They included Hanson Baldwin, possibly because of his earlier excoriation of the \\"Shasta Disaster,\\" and a radio crew from the National Broadcasting Company (which on 4 April 1937, had made a live six-minute broadcast from a B-17 at Langley Field) to broadcast from aboard the lead aircraft while it made the interception. LeMay used the Rex's noon position report of 11 May in conjunction with known routes and speeds of ocean liners bound for New York to calculate an intercept point for the next day, based on the ship's expected noon position for 12 May. An updated position report to refine his calculations was expected that evening but not received. Weather conditions deteriorated during the night, with a forecast that \\"ceilings would be down to nothing\\" in the vicinity of the anticipated interception.Correll, \\"Rendezvous with the Rex\\", p. 56. =Interception= Majors Vincent L. Meloy (center) and Caleb V. Haynes (right) during 1938 goodwill visit to Bogot√°, Colombia At 8:30 a.m. on 12 May, the three B-17s had begun to taxi in a rain squall when a morning position report from Rex was relayed to LeMay.LeMay and Kantor (1965), p. 189.LeMay wrote that the report was on a soaked piece of paper hand-delivered by a sergeant who literally beat on the hatch of the B-17 to get the bomber to stop. It indicated that the liner was then from New York, farther east than his original computations had placed it. LeMay's original flight plan had incorporated an area search if necessary, but weather conditions and the ship's distance from Long Island precluded that possibility. The B-17s took off from Mitchel Field at 8:45 a.m. and cruised east from Sandy Hook at 170 mph on a true course of 101 degreesMaurer (1987), p. 407. through rain, hail, downdrafts, and an intense headwind that reduced their ground speed by 11.5 mph. LeMay was unable to check the effect of the winds on ground speed and drift because of a heavy overcast that limited their altitude to . At 10:00 a.m. they emerged into good weather that lasted an hour. LeMay took double driftsThe Double Drift Maneuver is a method of wind determination that calculates winds aloft by taking drift readings on two different headings, then calculating the wind trigonometrically by plotting vectors on a graph. until the B-17s had to separate to transit a cold front. At 11:15 a.m. they reassembled in clear weather on the other side, where LeMay checked their course again. He calculated an intercept time of 12:25 p.m. for his pilot, who in turn passed it to Meloy to schedule the live radio broadcast. At noon the B-17s encountered an area of \\"scattered rain squalls,\\" spreading into a line abreast formation with the aircraft apart to increase their chances of spotting the Rex.Zamzow (2008), p. 48. At 12:23 p.m., the bombers broke out of a squall line, and Cousland in No. 81 immediately sighted the Rex. \\"There it is! There it is!\\" he transmitted by radio to the other pilots, \\"81 to 80, twelve o'clock.\\"LeMay, \\"USAF: Power For Peace\\", p. 294 At 12:25 p.m., as predicted, the B-17s flew by the Rex while it was east of Sandy Hook.Many sources indicate that Rex was from New York, while others state , possibly in confusion over statute and nautical miles. The \\"725\\" figure, however, came from Rex's reported position at 08:30. The Air Corps News Letter (15 June 1938) account indicated that the captain of the Rex reported during the radio contact between B-17s and ship that it \\"was the first time he had been welcomed to America while still 620 miles offshore\\" and is calculated here in nautical miles, as the ship would have to have been making 40 knots to cover the difference between 725 nautical miles (1300 km) and 620 statute miles (1000 km) in four hours. Calculated entirely in nautical miles places her passage at 27 knots, her rated speed.Goss (1954), p. 7. The aircraft reversed course and came up the ship's port side, with No. 82 flying wing on No. 80 \\"at smoke stack level\\". From the co-pilot's seat of No. 81, Goddard took a series of photographs with the Graflex. In the waist position of No. 80, Meloy made voice contact by radio with the ship's captain,Maurer (1987), p. 408.Head (1995), p. 203. who invited \\"all members of the flight to come down to lunch.\\" The ship's passengers filled its decks, waving to the bombers, with a group of Americans purportedly singing the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\". Because of the bad weather, the B-17s returned individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all the forward surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 4:30 p.m. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 9:30 a.m. as it entered New York Harbor. The NBC radio crew aboard the lead bomber made its live broadcast coast-to-coast as the bombers flew by the Rex. The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured the next day on the front pages of hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere.Underwood (1991), p. 117. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.Underwood (1991), pp. 116‚Äì117. AftermathImpact= The response of the War Department was to curb further expansion of the Air Corps and its roles.Underwood (1991), p. 119. On 16 May, the day of the \\"Farmingdale raid,\\" the Army's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Stanley Embick, approved a request from Air Corps chief Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover to substitute a single Boeing Y1B-20 (an advanced design of the Boeing B-15) for two B-15s ordered for Project A, the development program for the very long range bomber. On 9 June, however, Secretary of War Harry Woodring countermanded the approval, which he had endorsed only three weeks before.Greer (1985), p. 99. On 3 August, the Army went on to cancel orders for 67 more B-17s authorized under a \\"balanced\\" plan Woodring himself had put forth in March, instead allocating the funds to buy smaller combat aircraft,Tate (1998), p. 169. and forbade any further spending for R&D; of long-range bombers. It was not until January 1939, when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public statement calling for an expansion of the Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II and the needs of the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere, that Army policy was reversed.Williams (1953), p. 12.Underwood (1991), p. 137. Gen. George C. Marshall, who was soon to move up from head of the War Plans Division to be the Army's chief of staff, received personal instruction on the capabilities and strengths of long-range bombers from new Air Corps chief Gen. Henry H. Arnold.Underwood (1991), pp. 121‚Äì122. =Operational restriction= Gen. Malin Craig, Army Chief of Staff from 1935 to 1939 The day after the rendezvous with the Rex, Chief of Staff General Malin Craig telephoned Andrews and issued an order that restricted all Air Corps aircraft to operating within of the coast. Arnold, Eaker, Olds, and Lt. Col. Carl Spaatz all believed that complaints from the Navy motivated the order. Spaatz, who personally answered the call, recorded that Andrews requested the order be issued in writing, but Arnold states he never saw a written order.Arnold's corroboration is especially valuable in that he and Gen. Craig were long-time friends.Correll, \\"Rendezvous with the Rex\\", p. 57. Two Air Corps historians state that no evidence exists that the Navy was behind the order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity,Maurer (1987), p. 426. while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction.Head (1995), p. 204. Deputy chief of staff Embick made the claim that the restriction had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them.Greer (1985), p. 91 A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.Coffey (1982), p. 173.The actual source of the \\"100-mile restriction\\" remains a mystery. The AAF did extensive document searches in both 1945 and 1946 to clarify the situation, the 1946 search at the request of Hanson Baldwin, and concluded \\"that the Army, not the Navy\\" was the source. (Maurer 1987, p. 573, note 29) At least three times before the Rex interception the Army had restricted operational flights to 100 miles at sea as a safety measure in 1936-1937, but for the shorter-ranged two-engine B-10. That the restriction existed is beyond doubt. Maurer notes that Craig ordered a \\"directive\\" formalizing it be drawn up on 4 August 1938, and it remained in effect at least until Marshall became Chief of Staff. Only the Navy's role, if any, is disputed. In any event, the restriction fomented further interservice enmity between the Air Corps and the Navy that did not abate until World War II. The Navy specifically included the limit in plans for joint maneuvers in 1939 that was deleted only after Andrews objected to Marshall, who had replaced Embick as deputy chief of staff.Maurer (1987), p. 411. Emmons, who succeeded Andrews as commander of GHQ Air Force, complained in his \\"Report on Annual Tactical Inspection\\", dated 28 July 1939, that because of the operational restriction, navigation training in the Air Corps had suffered.Futrell (1971), p. 87. Despite this, exceptions to the restriction quickly became the norm. Only a month after the interception of the Rex, B-17s intercepted the 22,000-ton liner SS Queen of Bermuda at sea on 12 June,Haynes and Smith piloted two of the three B-17s involved. and aircraft based in Hawaii twice located Army transports at similar distances during the summer of 1938. In March 1939, Arnold, as Chief of the Air Corps, was given specific authority by the chief of staff to grant exceptions as he saw fit, provided they were unpublicized and he notified the War Department well in advance. =Subsequent history of the participants= Andrews was not reappointed as commander of General Headquarters Air Force when his term expired on 1 March 1939. Exactly as happened with Billy Mitchell, he was returned in rank to colonel (his permanent establishment rank) and assigned as air officer of the Eighth Corps Area in San Antonio, Texas.Correll, \\"GHQ Air Force\\", pp. 66-68. His \\"exile\\" in San Antonio was brief, however. In August, prospective Army Chief of Staff Marshall had Andrews promoted over the objections of Secretary Woodring and General Craig, beginning a climb to higher command for Andrews that culminated in promotion to lieutenant general and appointment as commander of the European Theater of Operations. Many senior airmen believed he was possibly being groomed to command the Normandy invasion.Copp, Andrews, p. 33. However, Andrews was killed in the crash of a B-24 Liberator long-range bomber in Iceland in May 1943 while returning to Washington, D.C.Copp, Andrews, p. 26. Capt. Archibald Y. Smith was promoted to colonel during World War II, commanded the 452nd Bomb Group (B-17) in the U.K., and became a prisoner of war in July 1944.Hinrichs (1995), p. 96 (MACR 7827). Continuing his career after the war in the United States Air Force, he died in the crash of his B-26 in Oregon in April 1949.The Oregonian, 22 April 1949, Obituary Bruce Wayne Spaulding. Lt. Spaulding's aircraft crashed while he was searching for Col. Smith. Cousland also became a colonel and commanded the first B-17 group in England, the 97th BG, although he was relieved of command by Col. Frank A. Armstrong just before it was to go into combat. Cousland finished the war commanding the 21st Bombardment Wing, a processing unit for personnel returning from overseas. Seven of the participants became general officers. Hull was recalled to active duty to be an intelligence officer in World War II, then remained in the Air Force as a career. He retired as a brigadier general in 1964. Meloy served as a brigadier general in the Air Transport Command and retired in 1946. Goddard was recognized as the principal aerial photography expert of the USAF and retired in 1953 as a brigadier general. Caleb V. Haynes and his crew won the MacKay Trophy in 1939 flying an earthquake relief mission to Chile in the XB-15, and delivered the first B-24 Liberator overseas in early 1942. Assigned initially to the Tenth Air Force, he was the first commander of the Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, the airlift operation flying supplies over the Hump to China.Weaver (1948), p. 498. Haynes went on to command the bombers of the China Air Task Force under Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, became a brigadier general, commanded the India Air Task Force, and retired from the USAF as a major general in 1953. Olds (whose son, Brig. Gen. Robin Olds, became a fighter pilot icon),Sherwood(1999), p. 42 was promoted to major general and commanded the Second Air Force, but died of a heart-related condition in April 1943 at the age of 46. Eaker and LeMay had important roles as commanders in the strategic bombing campaigns of World War II. Eaker took command of the Eighth Air Force in 1942, and the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces in 1944. He retired in 1947 as a lieutenant general, but was promoted on the retired list to 4-star general in 1985 in recognition of his accomplishments. In the autumn of 1942, LeMay led the 305th Bomb Group, one of the four \\"pioneer\\" B-17 groups of the Eighth Air Force.Freeman (1970), p. 20. He advanced to higher commands in the Eighth Air Force before holding a series of B-29 Superfortress commands in the Pacific in 1944‚Äì45, culminating in command of the Twentieth Air Force. LeMay commanded and reorganized the Strategic Air Command into an instrument of national policy and became the fifth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in 1961. No. 272 Squadron RAF Beaufighter, climbing away after strafing Rex (8 September 1944) Laid up in Trieste harbor, Italy, by the war, the Rex was seized by Nazi Germany when Italy surrendered in 1943. On 8 September 1944, she was attacked twice by Royal Air Force and South African Air Force Beaufighters. She was set on fire, then rolled over and sank after being struck by numerous rockets and cannon shells. The purpose of the attack was to prevent her from being used to block the harbor entrance.Kludas (1999), pp. 120‚Äì121. The wreck was partially scrapped in the 1950s, but around one-third of it still remains. The YB-17s quickly became obsolete and were transferred in October 1940 to the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, California, when the 2d BG acquired newer models.Shepherd, \\"Fortress Down!\\" During World War II they operated again at Langley Field until mid-1942. The Air Corps belatedly put the B-17 into mass production beginning in July 1940, but at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor still had only 198 in service. However, 12,000 were produced during the war, became the backbone of the air war against Germany, and were an iconic symbol of the AAF.Johnsen, \\"The Making of an Iconic Bomber\\" The 2nd Bomb Group received newer B-17s and served in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with both the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces.Maurer, Air Force Combat Units, entry \\"2nd Bombardment Group\\" GHQ Air Force assumed its designated wartime role in November 1940, was renamed Air Force Combat Command in June 1941, but went out of existence in March 1942 in a major reorganization of the United States Army Air Forces. =Operation Rex Redux= On 24 August 2007, three B-52 Stratofortresses of the 2nd Bomb Wing, successor to the 2nd BG, conducted \\"Operation Rex Redux\\", a training mission commemorating the interception of the Rex. Flying from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and using the radio call signs Rex 51, Rex 52, and Rex 53, the B-52s intercepted the Military Sealift Command ship MV 2nd Lt. John P. Bobo east of Bermuda to test the capabilities of a new targeting system.Hebert, \\"Rex Replay\\" NotesCitationsBibliography * Cate, James L. (1945).

It was created by Elena Ochoa Foster, founder of Ivorypress and is published twice yearly. It comes in two different editions, English/Chinese and Spanish/Japanese and is designed by Oscar Marin√© creator of Pedro Almod√≥var's movie posters. Description With a hardback cover and 300 pages, C International resembles a book more than a magazine. The magazine emphasizes design and aims to replicate the white walls and neutral background of an art gallery, with no interfering text in its central pages. Its creator said 'It would be extremely provincial to do it just in English,' and noted 'First I thought we would make it half in English and half in Spanish. Then I began to go to China a lot, and after discovering many photographers there, I knew a magazine like C Photo would have a following. I am convinced that Asia is the future'.Sujic, D: √ç Don't selling... I'm Sharing. The Guardian, Sunday 8 January 2006 The publisher of C International is Ivory Press. Magazine sections Within the core photographic pages, each issue has sub-sections: Collector, Archive, Scope, Portfolio, C Action, Vintage and Guest. In every issue the magazine publishes a private or public photographic collection alongside an interview with the owner or responsible curator of the collection in order to better understand the criteria behind the collection. The archive section sheds light on previously unpublished or unknown works, such as those of Isamu Noguchi, and Francis Bacon, and archives the charting history of cities such as London and Shanghai. This section provides an eclectic view of the world of international image making. Scope shows a selection of contemporary artists. It aims to illustrate the creative pulse of contemporary photography. Portfolio presents works created by contemporary photographers. Some of them comprise recent and unpublished works, while others live alongside previous series that help to bring each artist's work into context and to outline their evolution over the last few years. C Photo Magazine has established an initiative to promote the creation of contemporary photography. In each issue two artists are commissioned for a series that is published exclusively in this section of the magazine. The authors are awarded a cash grant as a contribution to the production of a portfolio that is made up of a minimum of six photographs. An edition of up to four copies is made from these works. The series created in this way for the C Action initiative has become part of C International Photo Magazine's Collection of Contemporary Photography, and will be gradually circulated both within its pages and through other media. The selection of participating artists is made by the editorial team of the magazine, in collaboration with various curators, gallery owners and photography specialists of both private and public institutions. The selected artists' profiles are not subject to any prior conditions including geographical origin or subject matter of the work presented. The legacy of the masters of photography is represented in the Vintage section. =Guest= In each issue, C Photo Magazine invites a ‚Äòguest‚Äô, generally from a creative field outside of photography, to reveal their most recent ventures into photography or how they use it in their creative processes. This section approaches photography from a different angle, and as a result, reveals the multi-faceted nature of this medium. Wim Wenders, Brian Eno, Bill Viola and Marina Abramoviƒá are amongst guest collaborators. The publication is predominantly devoted to photography.

The Weteye held of liquid sarin and was officially known as the Mk 116 (Mark 116). Stockpiles of Weteyes were transferred to Utah in the 1980s amidst controversy and protest. History The Weteye bomb was developed for the United States Navy during the early 1960s. The US Navy at China Lake, California attempted to develop a massive chemical bomb with a high fill efficiency (~70%). At the same time the US Army Chemical Center worked with the EDO corporation to develop the EX 38, a chemical bomb with unique design features: 1) thin seamless hydrospun aluminum body, 2) weighted nose, 3) large plastic fins, and 4) a system of internal baffles to keep the 10% minimum void captured in the tail section of the bomb. The prototype Weteye design, with its shaped internal burster and folding fins, was combined with the EX38 design features to create the production model of the Weteye. The Weteye was originally developed for delivery of GB and VX nerve agents. Production was limited to filling with double-distilled GB. The VX variants were not produced. During the Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) there was consideration of repurposing the Weteye design to deliver firefighting chemicals to extinguish oil well fires set by retreating Iraqi forces. In 1963, the supercarrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) (SBC-127C) was intended to contain 100 Weteyes as part of its magazine load. In 1969 the entire arsenal of US Weteye bombs were stored at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado. Most Weteye bombs stored at Rocky Mountain Arsenal were demilitarized and destroyed in 1977; however, approximately 900 Weteye bombs were not destroyed at this time. Specifications The interior of the Weteye was divided into three sections. The Weteye body was composed of thin aluminum alloy. It had fins which deployed after the bomb was released. The 240-kilogram Weteye held about of liquid sarin nerve agent. Nomenclature Weteye bomb Officially, the Weteye was known as the Mark 116, or Mk-116 bomb. While this was the official military nomenclature for the weapon, early in its production it acquired the nickname \\"Weteye\\". Weteye was derived from the fact that the weapon was filled with a liquid nerve agent, sarin, thus the \\"wet\\" portion of the name. The \\"eye\\" portion of the name was associated with it being developed by the US Navy at China Lake as part of its eye-series weapon program (bombs guided by the \\"Mark 1 eyeball\\"), a program intended to improve air-delivered munitions. Transfer to Utah Demilitarization operations at Rocky Mountain Arsenal left exactly 888 Weteye bombs intact and in storage in Colorado. In 1981 the U.S. Department of Defense sought to relocate the weapons to the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility at the Deseret Chemical Depot. This move was opposed by many residents of Utah and the state's governor at the time Scott M. Matheson.\\"GOVERNOR (1977-1985 : MATHESON): Weteye Nerve Gas Bomb Records 1960-1982\\", Utah State Archives and Records Service, Series 19410, accessed December 17, 2008. The transfer was controversial and Matheson continued to fight it until the U.S. Senate passed a bill which included an amendment sponsored by then-U.S. Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) requiring the weapons be moved out of Colorado. Matheson's concern stemmed from the fact that some of the thin-shelled Weteyes stored in Colorado were leaking nerve agent. After rounds of protests and legal action that went to the U.S. District Court the transfer went ahead. An Air Force C-141 jet carried the initial transfer of 64 Weteye bombs on August 12, 1981 to an air field at Dugway Proving Ground. The event was heavily covered by the media. The moves continued for the next three weeks and Weteyes were moved to the south area of the Tooele Army Depot, which became known as the Deseret Chemical Depot. In 1996, the Deseret Chemical Depot began destruction operations of general chemical weapons. In the spring of 2001 destruction and demilitarization of the Weteyes began and the operation ended in December 2001 with the destruction of the last of 888 Weteyes. Disposal and transfer issues Public relations officials for the Deseret Chemical Depot asserted at the time that during the 2001 disposal operations there were \\"no problems\\". However, Eric Croddy reported in his 2005 book Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History that a number of issues came up during the destruction operations. One of those issues, that of leaking munitions, was an issue long before the weapons arrived at Deseret and the primary reason that Gov. Matheson and many Utah residents were opposed to the weapons transfer in the first place.Bauman, Joe. \\"Final goodbye for the 'Weteye'\\", Deseret News (Salt Lake City), December 26, 2001, accessed December 17, 2008.Staff. \\"Minute Amount of Nerve Gas Is Found in Bomb Container\\", The New York Times, August 26, 1981, accessed December 17, 2008. Other issues to surface during disposal operations were high levels of mercury contamination and the tendency of the aluminum casing to explode inside the decontamination furnace. Molten aluminum and water presents a potential explosion hazard and because the Weteye contained a liquid nerve agent the potential for an interaction of molten aluminum and the liquid agent existed.Committee on Review and Evaluation of the Army Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program, U.S. National Research Council. Review of Systemization of the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, (Google Books), National Academies Press, 1996, p. 62, (). These issues combined to make the Weteye sufficiently difficult to dispose of that it required special handling.

Denslow Pie or, Pieman, Pieman is an outdoor game for more than three children. Its origin is unknown. A variant exists called Easter Eggs. Description The game requires a seating area for the players (such as a flight of porch steps or a garden wall) which is designated the \\"Pie Shop\\" or \\"Bakery.\\" Also required are a Goal distant from the seating area such as a tree, post or other object, and an expanse of lawn or field for a chase similar to the chase in the game of Tag. One player is chosen Pieman, another Buyer, and the other players are Pies. The Buyer is sometimes designated Simple Simon following the Mother Goose rhyme: :Simple Simon met a pieman :Going to the fair; :Says Simple Simon to the pieman, :\\"Let me taste your ware.\\" To begin the game, the Buyer is sent to the Goal where he cannot see or hear the other players. The Pieman then names each Pie with a common pie filling such as Apple, Blueberry, Pumpkin, etc. When all the Pies have been named, the Pieman calls the Buyer to the Pie Shop. The Buyer demands, \\"Pieman, Pieman, I would like a pie.\\" The Pieman asks, \\"And what might that Pie be?\\" The Buyer then names a pie flavor such as Apple. If one of the Pies has been designated Apple, then he rushes from the Pie Shop to the Goal while the Buyer runs after him and attempts to tag him. Both the Pie and the Buyer must touch the Goal before running back to the Pie Shop. If the Pie returns to the Pie Shop without being tagged, he resumes his seat, and is renamed for another round. The chase may be complicated with dodging about lawn furniture, flower beds, clotheslines of drying laundry, or other obstacles in the path to and from the Goal. Before the Buyer leaves the Pie Shop in pursuit of the Pie, he is required to pay the Pieman the price he asks for the Pie (such as 10 dollars). Payment is accomplished by slapping the Pieman's outstretched, up- turned palm, and counting aloud the required number of \\"dollars.\\" Paying the Pieman gives slower, or smaller Pies a \\"head-start\\" against the Buyer. Should the Pie be \\"tagged\\" during his flight to the Goal, he becomes the Buyer, the Buyer becomes a Pie, and play resumes in a similar manner. Variants A variation of the game for children who may have limited knowledge of pie flavors is Easter Eggs. Here, players are given colors (red, blue, green, purpleÔºåetc.) rather than pie fillings. The Pieman becomes The Easter Bunny and the seating area the Easter Basket. Another variant is called Red Devil, where one child is removed from the group, and the kids are assigned colors (pink,yellow,blue) the child then returns and says \\"Red Devil, Red Devil, may I borrow a crayon?\\" the group then asks \\"What color?\\" and like pie the color chosen must try to catch the asker before the asker takes that person's seat. In another variant, the Buyer is known as the Witch. The Witch says to the Baker: \\"Do you have any pies today?\\" The Baker replies, \\"What kind do you want?\\" If the Witch names one of the Pies, he or she must chase the named Pie around a designated spot, such as a tree or a light post. If the Pie gets back to the Pie Shop safely, the game begins again. However, if the Pie is caught, he or she becomes the new Witch. The Witch now becomes a Pie and sits with the others on the Pie Shop shelf and the game continues.

It replaced the ancient court of the exchequer of Normandy, set up by Rollo, first duke of Normandy. The parlement was built in a mixing of the French Flamboyant style and Renaissance architecture by Roger Ango and Roulland le Roux, between 1499 and 1508, during the reign of the king Louis XII of France. Today, the building is the seat of the courthouse of the city of Rouen.  History  A decree of the parlement de Normandie from 1787. Raised to a sovereign court and given a base in Rouen by Louis XII of France, this court's name was changed from √©chiquier to parlement by Francis I of France on his accession in 1515. The parlement de Rouen had responsibility for the seven great bailliages of Normandy ‚Äì Rouen, Caudebec-en-Caux, √âvreux, Les Andelys, Caen, Coutances and Alen√ßon. It was thus made up of 4 presidents (of which the first and third were clergy and the other two laymen), 13 clergy councillors, 15 lay councillors, 2 greffiers (a secretary for civil law and one for criminal law), a huissier audiencier (the bailiff who officially assigns documents between lawyers and introduces the judges in the public court room), 6 other huissiers de justice, 2 advocates general and 1 procurator general. Following letters patent of 1507 from Louis XII, the archbishop of Rouen and the abbot of Saint- Ouen were 'ex officio' honorary councillors to the parlement. When the court of the √©chiquier was made permanent, it was divided into two chambers, one to sit in the morning and the other in the afternoon. This second chamber later became known as the premi√®re des enqu√™tes. The chambre de la Tournelle, entrusted with criminal cases, was built in 1519 and the chambre des vacations was not set up until 1547. Until 1 October 1506, the parlement de Normandie sat in the ch√¢teau de Rouen then in the palais (which was begun in 1499 and only completed long afterwards). Many kings of France held lits de justice at the parlement de Normandie. Charles VIII held one on 27 April 1485 and at it confirmed Normandy's privileges. Louis XII was accompanied there by the main officers of his court on 24 October 1508. On 2 August 1517, Francis I held one there, accompanied by chancellor Duprat and many officers of his court. Some days later, the dauphin came to the parliament, where he was granted the same honors as the king himself, as the king had ordered. In January 1518, he granted the parlement de Normandie the same privileges as that of the parlement de Paris and, by another edict the following February, temporarily exempted it from the arri√®re-ban. On 8 October 1550, Henri II held a lit de justice at the parlement de Rouen, accompanied by the cardinals, king Henry II of Navarre, many dukes, constable Anne de Montmorency, the admiral, the duc de Longueville, chancellor Olivier, and many other lords. Charles IX was declared of age at the parlement, accompanied by chancellor Michel de L'Hospital. In 1523, Francis I exempted the parlement from the gabelle and ordained that it would issue to each of his officers and his widow as much salt as it had for his household, without fixing the quantity, paying only the market price, on the condition it did not abuse this privilege. In 1540 chancellor Guillaume Poyet set the king against the parlement de Rouen, and the king banned it. Commissaires were named for the Tournelle, and a president and 12 councillors sent to Bayeux, to give justice to the subjects of basse-Normandie until the king raised his ban; and wishing to give to this court's officers a mark of his satisfaction with their conduct, in June 1542 he made the arri√®re-ban exemption general and perpetual via an edict. In 1560, the parlement de Normandie and the other provincial parlements were suppressed before being reestablished in June 1568 by Charles IX. In February 1589, an edict of the month by Henry IV of France transferred the parlement to Caen after Rouen rose against the king, before it was reestablished in Rouen by another edict of 8 April 1594. Banned again in 1639, for not having opposed the revolt of the va- nu-pieds strongly enough, it as replaced by commissaires from the parlement de Paris until its reestablishment in January 1641.Pierre Miquel, Les Guerres de religion, Club France Loisirs, 1980, () p. 367 In April 1545, Francis I had set up a criminal chamber here to judge cases relating to Protestants, which was replaced by a chambre de l‚Äô√©dit, as part of the execution of the edict of Nantes of April 1598, suppressed in its turn in January 1685 as part of the edict of Fontainebleau. Made up at this time of 57 councillors and 2 presidents, an edict of July 1680 created a second chambre des enqu√™tes, after which the parlement was made up of five chambers, the grand-chambre, the Tournelle, two chambres des enqu√™tes and the chambre des requ√™tes du palais right up until the French Revolution. It was at the parlement de Normandie that, from 1728, the general assemblies of d√©put√©s of different courts and other notables met to discuss public affairs such as hospitals' needs and other necessities.

Gameplay Old Snake in action. The player navigates through several missions based on stages from Metal Gear Solid 4, each introduced by brief text summarizing the story so far. The player moves their finger across the screen to aim, tapping to fire, and moving their fingers together or apart to zoom in or out with a sniper rifle, removing their fingers from the screen to get behind cover and avoid enemy fire. The main character's primary weapons, an assault rifle and a sniper rifle, can be rotated with one another by pinching the device's screen. The player plays as Solid Snake, who is also known as Old Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4. The entirety of Metal Gear Solid 4 has been streamlined into a portable and more accessible form. The main objective of most missions is to kill a set number of enemies. Enemies include hostile PMC soldiers, Haven Troopers and Gekkos, which are unmanned fighting machinations. There are also friendly targets which the player is penalised for shooting at. Some sections contain 'Boss fights', where the player fights a boss from the Metal Gear Solid 4 storyline; e.g. Laughing Octopus. At the end of each mission, the player is awarded a rank based on their precision and speed in completing the mission. Higher ranks award more Drebin Points, which can be used to buy rewards such as iPhone character wallpapers.

The portal was founded on the initiative of the German Foreign Office, in reaction to the crisis ridden developments in relations to Islamic cultures in the wake of the shock of the September 11 attacks in the USA. Online since March 2003, the platform is jointly run by the German Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb), Germany‚Äôs international broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), the Goethe-Institut (GI) and the German Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations (ifa), and is funded by the foreign office. The task of the joint dialogue project is to promote understanding between the various cultures, with the aim of combating ignorance and prejudice through knowledge. The editorial team works to publish writing by Western and Islamic authors who seek open and respectful discussion of both commonalities and controversial subjects. These have included diverse contributors, like the Egyptian literary scholar Nasr Hamid Abu Zaid, the German former diplomat and Muslim Murad Hofmann, the Islam theologian Halima Krausen, the conflict researcher Heiner Bielefeldt and the physicist Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker.

As a traditional ruler he had extensive powers under the British colonial authority. Early years Bayero was born in 1299 AH (1881). He received his early Islamic education at the Sarki‚Äôs palace and he was guided by the prominent Islamic scholars of his time. While he was the Chiroma of Kano and District Head of Bichi he became very closely associated with the prominent Ulama. When the British colonial administrators introduced the new district administrative structure Abdullahi Bayero, who was then Chiroma, was appointed the Head of the Home Districts with headquarters at Dawakin Kudu and later (1914) at Panisau. He was appointed Sarki Kano in April 1926 and was formally installed on 14 February 1927.Adamu Mohammed Fika, The Kano Civil War and British over-rule, 1882-1940, OUP, 1978,p 227 He was the most experienced contender for the Emirship and had also proved that he was honest, efficient, dedicated and upright.  Life career  Sarki Kano Abdullahi Bayero made several appointments during his long reign. Among those he appointed were his sons Muhammad Sanusi whom he appointed Ciroma and District Head of Bichi, the position he held before his appointment as the Sarki; and Aminu who was appointed Dan Iya and District Head of Dawakin Kudu. After the deposition of Muhammad son of Sarki Kano Shehu Usman from Turaki and District Head of Ungogo he appointed his brothers Abdulkadir and Muhammad Inuwa as Galadima and Turaki respectively in 1927. He reduced the influence of the Cucanawa and also freed all other royal slaves, which was in line with the British anti slavery policy. He also delegated some of his executive responsibilities to his councilors.Fika 1978, p 226 As Sarki Kano Bayero was committed to the commercial and industrial development of Kano he encouraged genuine industrial undertakings: for example the Gwamaja Textile Mills, which was the first modern textile producer in Nigeria. He also encouraged indigenous individual entrepreneurs such as the highly successful Alhaji Alhassan Dantata. The social service sector was accorded the necessary attention by his Emirate Council. Kano city was the first place in the North to have electricity and a water supply on a large scale. This was chiefly the result of the initiative of Abdullahi Bayero, who proposed in 1927 that surplus funds in the Native Administration accounts be used to provide an electricity and a water supply for the whole of Kano. Until then, these services had been supplied only to the Government area. The Public Works Department in Lagos strongly opposed these proposals on the grounds of expense and lack of availability of staff to undertake the work. Nevertheless, the Native Administration went ahead and obtained estimates from a contractor and the work began. Water was pumped from the Challawa River ten miles from the town and each compound in the city was provided with at least one lamp standard. In 1929 the scheme was formally opened amidst great celebrations. Initially maintained by the Native Administration's own staff, the scheme proved to be a great success and soon paid for itself.Sir Rex Niven, Nigerian Kaleidoscope: Memoirs of a Colonial Servant, London, 1982, pp 124-25  Islamic study contribution  Sarki Kano Abdullahi Bayero had a keen interest in Islamic education and he contributed morally and materially towards its development. As a result of this, Kano had many prominent Islamic scholars during his reign, including Shehu Muhammad Salga and his students Abubakar Mijinyawa and Umar Falke. He established the Shahuchi Judicial School in 1348 AH (1929), the first of its kind in Nigeria with Shaikh Sulaiman, his long term colleague, who initiated the idea as its first headmaster. The Kano Law School, which later became the School for Arabic Studies, grew from the Shahuchi Judicial School through the efforts of Waziri Gidado (Yahya 1986), who was then the Chief Islamic and Legal Adviser of the Sarki. He was also encouraged the showing of respect to the Shariffs by Shaikh Sulaiman (Paden 1973), his initiator into the Tijaniyya (a mystic sufi brotherhood founded by Shaikh Ahmad al-Tijani of Algeria). Sarki Kano Abdullahi Bayero was the first Sarki to perform the Hajj, hence he is popularly known as Sarki Alhaji. He was accompanied on this journey by his younger brother Galadima Abdulkadir and Ma‚Äôaji Mallam Sulaiman, who later became the first Walin Kano. It was during this Hajj trip that they first met Shaikh Ibrahim Niass of Senegal and they accepted him as their Shaykh. After the Hajj, Sarki Abdullahi visited Egypt where he saw many magnificent mosques. When he returned he began the building of the new Kano mosque, the first of its kind in northern Nigeria and still one of the most beautiful mosques in the area.  Politics  Towards the end of his reign the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) was formed by the following Kano politicians: Abba Maikwaru, Bello Ijumu, Babaliya Manaja, Musa Kaula, Abdulkadir Danjaji, Musa Bida, Magaji Dambatta and Mudi Spikin (Abba 2000: ix). This was a radical political party which questioned colonial rule and the traditional establishment. But Sarkin Kano Abdullahi Bayero was very cautious. When the NEPU leaders were brought before his court for alleged sedition and the palace officials including Ulama advised the Emir that they were not Muslims and deserved death, he refused to accept this advice, arguing that 'we must have done something wrong for these young men to challenge us'. Sarki Kano Alhaji Abdullahi Bayero never compromised his Islamic convictions despite his progressive ideas (Yahya 1986). He will be remembered in the history of Kano as a sincere, honest, pious and patient Sarki. He was a man of great simplicity who used to sew his own clothes and was very caring for his junior staff, as in the case of Inuwa Wali, when the Sarki directed one of the ward heads, against the wishes of the courtiers, to ensure that he was given a house. He was eventually given a house in the Mandawari quarters, where he lived for more than fifty years. Sarki Kano Alhaji Abdullahi Bayero died on Thursday 13th Rabi al-Thani 1373 (23 December 1953).

Ravishankar was from Point Pedro. He joined the LTTE in December 1985, whilst still at school, and took on the nom de guerre Charles. His first duty was to be a sentry near Point Pedro army camp after school. He abandoned his education in 1987. He then worked in a shop run by the LTTE. Charles' first armed combat was in May 1987 during the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) in which the Sri Lankan military recaptured most of Vadamarachchi. He took part in the LTTE's retaliatory attack on the army camp at Nelliady Central College on 5 July 1987. Charles then served under Captain Morris, the LTTE's commander for Point Pedro, taking part in operations against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Charles then served in Manal Aru before returning to Jaffna peninsula. He was the LTTE's commander for Vadamarachchi when the IPKF withdrew to India in 1990. Charles was introduced to the LTTE's intelligence head Pottu Amman by his body guard Kili. Pottu Amman chose Charles to prepare a base in southern Sri Lanka for attacks. Charles and some other intelligence operatives were sent to Colombo in early 1990. He returned to the north after war broke out again between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan military in June 1990. The LTTE then received intelligence that Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne and the Joint Operations Command were planning to assassinate LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran as he and his wife Mathivathani were praying at the Nallur Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna. Charles was sent back to Colombo in January 1991 to deliver the LTT's response to the assassination plot. Wijeratne was assassinated on 2 March 1991 and the Joint Operations Command building was blown up on 22 June 1991. Charles is alleged to have taken part in both attacks. He is also alleged to have taken part in the assassinations of Clancy Fernando (16 November 1992); Lalith Athulathmudali (23 April 1993); President Ranasinghe Premadasa (1 May 1993); and Gamini Dissanayake, Ossie Abeygunasekera, Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi, G. M. Premachandra and Gamini Wijesekara (24 October 1994). He is also alleged to have taken part in the attacks on the Kolonnawa fuel storage complex (20 October 1995) and Kelanithissa power plant (14 November 1997). Charles is alleged to have masterminded the Central Bank bombing on 31 January 1996. Prabhakaran is alleged to have given Charles a Mitsubishi Pajero as a reward for the Central Bank attack. After the Sri Lankan authorities became aware of his presence in Colombo, Charles moved to the East, serving as the LTTE's intelligence head in Batticaloa-Ampara between 1997 and 2000. During this time he is alleged to have masterminded the assassinations of Neelan Tiruchelvam (29 July 1999); Lucky Algama (8 December 1999); and C. V. Gunaratne (7 June 2000). He is also believed to have been behind the unsuccessful assassination attempt on President Chandrika Kumaratunga on 18 December 1999. He led the successful commando raid on Bandaranaike International Airport on 24 July 2001 in which no civilians were hurt. After the 2002 ceasefire Charles started expanding the LTTE's intelligence network in the Colombo region, particularly Sinhalese members of the police and armed forces. He is also worked to eliminate members of Tamil paramilitary groups and Tamils spying for the Sri Lankan authorities.

Richard and Jane had three daughters, Mary, Elizabeth, and Annie. His surname also appears as McHeffy. He represented the township of Windsor in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1838 to 1840 and was called to the province's Legislative Council in 1853. When Hiram Blanchard tendered the resignation of his government in 1867, after being defeated by Joseph Howe's anti- confederation party, Lieutenant-Governor Charles Hastings Doyle called upon McHeffey to form the administration of the new government. McHeffey had long been a respected member of Nova Scotia's Liberal Party, but held no conspicuous position at the time of his appointment that would mark him for political leadership. He nonetheless undertook the task and called at once for a meeting of the anti-confederate members of the Assembly and of the Legislative Council at Halifax. At Halifax, McHeffey successfully formed an administration for the new government under the leadership of William Annand. McHeffey became minister without portfolio in the Executive Council. He served as custos rotulorum for Hants County and was also a senior Grand Warden in the province's Freemasons. He died in Windsor at the age of 100. His grandson Francis R.

His work is known for its fusion of the Chinese spiritual aesthetic of ink brush painting with Western abstract expressionism. His reputation has grown since his death thanks to some major retrospective exhibitions. Early life T‚Äôang Haywen was born in 1927 in Xiamen in Fujian Province, China. His early intellectual development was deeply influenced by his grandfather, who introduced him to the principles of Taoism, which strongly shaped T'ang's outlook, and later his art. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, T'ang's family migrated to Vietnam and settled in Cholon, the Chinese district of Saigon, where T'ang's father established a successful silk business. T'ang attended the French school in Saigon and learned calligraphy from his grandfather. At the age of 19, T'ang adopted the name Haywen: when written in Chinese, the name consists of the ideograms for \\"sea\\" and \\"literature\\". (The name would be written h«éiw√©n in the pinyin romanisation system; \\"T'ang\\" is a regional pronunciation of his surname character Êõæ, which is pronounced \\"zƒìng\\" in standard Chinese.) Migration to France and artistic career In 1948, T'ang moved to Paris, ostensibly to study medicine in keeping with the wishes of his father. However, once in France, T'ang soon began to pursue his long-held ambition to be a painter. He undertook little formal artistic training, but spent much time in museums and galleries, where he closely observed the work of Western masters, quoting them freely in his early oils and watercolors. He quickly developed a passion for travel, a constant feature of his life that was reflected in his art and career: his very first exhibition (1955) was in Paris, but it would be seven years before he again showed his work in France: during the intervening period he had shows in Switzerland, Canada and Luxembourg, and three in Morocco. Untitled, Ink on Kyro card,1970,Diptych. Art Institute of Chicago -USA By the mid-1960s, T'ang's work was showing a preference for gouache or ink on paper, and traditional Chinese stylistic elements were becoming a feature of his painting. His works were influenced by the aesthetic legacy of Western masters like Henri Matisse, Turner and the impressionists, and shaped by the spiritual elements of the Taoist approach to painting, in which the artist seeks to capture the interplay of energies that give life to the natural world.http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/2463 Typical works of this period were quick studies of scenes in the natural world, often rendered in a few brushstrokes, that gave life to his conviction that \\"painting is the embodiment of energy.\\" His synthesis of the Eastern Taoist tradition with a Western aesthetic, together with the arresting beauty of his compositions, began to attract serious attention from a small circle of critics, painters and admirers. During the 1970s, he refined the artistic format in which his works would be produced - the diptych on paper, usually untitled and measuring 70 x 100 cm. In Goa, India, T'ang met the filmmaker Tom Tam, and the two collaborated on two short films. They shot Furen Boogie on the beach in Goa and several months later, in T'ang's small apartment-studio in Paris, they shot T'ang Boogie.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ8lQLUK-iw T'ang Boogie renders the artist's work as a series of fleeting images and is the first known example of an experimental movie by a Chinese artist.http://www.asianart.com/exhibitions/haywen/intro.html During the 1980s he had some significant exhibitions in France, notably at the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts de Vitr√© and the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts de Vannes. However, did not gain any significant recognition during his lifetime. In 1989, six months after the Tian Anmen square protest T'ang participated in a show at the Centre Georges Pompidou https://www.centrepompidou.fr/media/imgcoll/Collection/DOC/M5050/M5050_A/M5050_ARCV001_DP-1999093.pdf entitled Tian Anmen 4 Juin-4 D√©cembre je n'oublie pas . In May 1991 his friend Yonfan Manshih, the movie director and photographer from Hong Kong, shot T'ang's last known portrait in his small apartment of the rue Liancourt in Paris. It was published in November 1991 in \\"A Chinese Portrait\\" http://www.yonfan.com/works.html along with images of Chang Dai-chien and Zao Wou-Ki in their studio. T'ang Haywen died of respiratory complications in Paris on September 9, 1991. He was 64 years old. Posthumous reputation T'ang Haywen's art found a wider public after his death, thanks to several retrospective exhibitions, notably at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco in 1996, at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum in Taiwan in 1997, The mus√©e Tavet- Delacour in Pontoise, France in 1999, the Mus√©e Guimet in Paris and the gallery of the Shiseido Foundation in Tokyo in 2002 and monographic exhibitions such as T'ang Haywen a modern Chinese painter at the Art Basel Hong Kong fair in 2013http://www.wanderlister.com/post/51936140034/artbaselhk13-from-booth-to- booth-a#.VU2pXbr-c9V and in September 2014 an exhibition at the de Sarthe gallery in Hong Kong http://butterboom.com/lifestyle/art/de-sarthe-gallery- presents-colours-ink-solo-exhibition-tang-haywen/ with an \\"exhibition catalog\\" with texts by Yonfan Manshih and Jean-Paul Desroches.

With the exception of the tower wrongly associated with Joan of Arc, which was restored by Viollet- le-Duc, the castle was destroyed at the end of the 16th century, its stones quarried for other construction.  History  The castle was built by Philip II of France from 1204 to 1210 following his capture of the duchy from John, Duke of Normandy and King of England. Located outside the medieval town to its north, in a dominant position, it played a military role in the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of Religion. It was the main seat of power, administration and politics in the duchy of Normandy for nearly 400 years, symbolically replacing the ducal palace of Rouen in these roles ‚Äì of the bailliage and vicomt√© of the king of France, of the English government of the area (1418‚Äì1449), of the √©chiquier de Normandie (which became the Parlement de Normandie). It was here that Joan of Arc was imprisoned in December 1430 and tried from 21 February to 23 May 1431. Vulnerable to artillery like other medieval fortresses, all but the keep (now known as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc) was dismantled in 1591. Tour Jeanne d'Arc Formerly known as the castle's donjon or \\"Grosse Tour\\", this tower is part of Philip's 1204 phase. It housed one of the sessions of Joan of Arc's trial on 9 May 1431, one in which she was shown the instruments of torture, to which she replied \\"Truly, if you have to pull my members and my soul from my body, I shall say nothing else; and if I say something to you, I would always say to you afterwards that you made me say it by force.\\". She was not imprisoned here but in the now-lost Tour de la Pucelle, whose foundations may be seen at 102 rue Jeanne d'Arc. The pointed roof was added in restoration works beginning in the 1870s. During the Second World War the tower was camouflaged and turned into a bunker by the occupying German forces. It is now open to the public.

The new Parlement de Normandie in Rouen, which replaced the old exchequer of Normandy in 1508. The Exchequer of Normandy (√âchiquier de Normandie) or Exchequer of Rouen (√âchiquier de Rouen) was the fiscal and administrative court of the Duchy of Normandy until the early 16th century. Surviving records show that the Exchequer of Normandy was operating in 1180, while the English Exchequer existed in 1110. No establishment date is known for either and therefore it is impossible to know which existed first. The Dialogue concerning the Exchequer presents it as a general belief that the Norman kings established the English Exchequer loosely modeled on the Norman one, while noting with some doubt an alternative view that an English Exchequer existed in Anglo-Saxon times. In 1315 the Norman Barons pressed a new charter, the \\"Charte aux Normands\\" on Louis X of France with the result that the decisions of the Exchequer of Normandy was declared final, meaning that Paris could not overturn decisions made in Rouen and that the King could not raise a new tax on the Normans without their approval. The Exchequer of Normandy was later superseded by the Parliament of Normandy in 1508.

Context The Nu-Pieds revolt was the culmination of a series of troubles or ‚Äúagitations‚Äù that shook Normandy for more than a decade. For some time, the royal budget had been in deficit (58 million livres in 1639 at a total expenditure of 172 million). To finance itself, the kingdom issued fiscal expedients. Normandy, one of the richest provinces of the kingdom, was obliged to make strong contributions. Each time, the fiscal pressure provoked problems, like in Rouen in 1623, when people protested against the obligation to pay charges for brouettiers, for chiffonniers etc. to the tax office; or in 1628 and 1634 in protest against a tax on leather markings. CourseEtymology The term ‚Äúva-nu-pied‚Äù appeared in 1639 in the work Histoire des Secretaires d‚Äô√âtat (History of State Secretaries) by Antoine Fauvelet du Toc under the spelling ‚ÄúVa nuds pieds‚Äù and, from 1646, in the columns of the journal Mercure Fran√ßois under the name ‚ÄúJean va Nuds- pieds‚Äù (‚ÄúJohn walks Barefooted‚Äù). The expression is the origin of the noun ‚Äúva-nu-pieds‚Äù which has an invariable form.

It was fiercest in Lower Brittany, where it took on an anti-lordly tone and became known as the revolt of the Bonnets rouges (after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents according to region) or revolt of the Torrebens (a war cry and signature in one of the peasant codes). It was unleashed by an increase in taxes, including the papier timbr√©, needed to authenticate official documents. (Bonnets may well refer to the ancient family descended from Henry de Bohal who are also known as Bonnet, Bot, etc. ~ see history of Pleucdeuc) ContextFranco-Dutch War= Louis XIV declared war on the Dutch Republic in 1672. Unlike in the War of Devolution, after a rapid advance the French army was stopped by the Dutch deliberately breaching the dykes and flooding the land. The war dragged on. The Dutch fleet threatened the French coast, notably the Brittany coast, off which it cruised in April‚ÄìMay 1673 (after a landing on Belle-√éle in 1673 and another landing on Groix in 1674). This interfered with Breton trade. To finance the French war effort, new taxes were levied: * first a tax on papier timbr√© (paper that was compulsory for all documents used in law, such as wills, sale contracts and vital records), in April 1674, raising the price of such documents, all the while risking a fall in the number of cases for professionals, leading to general discontent *on 27 September 1674, the sale of tobacco was made a royal monopoly, which imposed a tax and sold it in afferme. Those the king authorised to re-sell the tobacco (fermiers and commis) bought stock from the merchants to whom they had sold it in the first place. The reorganisation of the distribution network resulted in a temporary interruption to the distribution of smoking and chewing tobacco, which also caused discontent *in the same period, a new tax on all tin objects (even those bought long before) upset the peasants as well as the cabaretiers hit by the tax, which resulted in a high rise in the price of consumables *finally another tax, affecting fewer people, required commoners in possession of a noble fiefdom to pay a tax every 20 years =Situation in Brittany= These threats and new taxes added to an already-difficult economic situation in Brittany, then a heavily populated area (with around 10% of France's population at the time) after being spared famines and epidemics since the 1640s. In the 1660s and 70s it entered a phase of economic difficulties, largely linked to the first effects of Louis XIV's policy of economic warfare, the simultaneous increase in taxes and structural weaknesses: for example, a 66% reduction in the wine and canvas trade after the duc de Chaulnes (nicknamed ', \\"the fat pig\\", in Breton), governor of Brittany reduced the land revenues (fermages) and those on wine and canvas by a third, leading to general deflation, except offices. In addition, the domain cong√©able system, which regulated the relationship between peasant farmers and the owners of the land they cultivated, was archaic, and gave no incentive to either peasants or landowners to invest in improvements in farming methods. Indeed, facing a fall in income after 1670, landlords became more punctilious in demanding their rights, which may have contributed to the uprising. This view however is disputed by Jean Meyer who noted that it is \\"questionable\\" whether there was any significant relation between the areas in which domain cong√©able operated and those in which the rebellion erupted. It may be significant that parishes outside the cong√©able system rebelled, while others within it did not. It may be added that the abolition of the system is not demanded in the surviving \\"peasant codes\\". Women played an active role in the revolt. At this time, Royal law was significantly reducing both the economic and citizenship rights that women had formerly enjoyed. Women had no right to choose their own husbands for example. This struck hard in a land where women played a very important role, and this issue is identified in the peasant codes. Finally, Brittany was a Pays d'√âtats with its own parliaments, the Estates of Brittany and the Parliament of Brittany. It was exempted from the \\"gabelle\\" (salt tax), and new taxes should be agreed by the Estates, as guaranteed in 1532 Act of Union between Brittany and France. In 1673, the Estates had, in addition to a gift of 2.6 million livres, bought the abolition of the Chambre des domaines (which deprived some nobles of legal rights) for the same amount and acquired the royal edicts establishing new taxes, plus other expenses for the royal power, for the huge sum of 6.3 million livres. A year later, the same edicts were restored, without consulting the Estates. Also, through the Parliament of Brittany, Louis XIV registered tax on stamped paper in August 1673, and the tobacco tax in November 1674, in defiance of \\"Breton liberties\\", as Bretons at the time called their privileges under the Treaty of Union.See , and texts on the peasant codes. The new charges involved more expense for small farmers and townspeople compared to the privileged classes,Collectif, Histoire de la Bretagne et des pays celtiques, Skol Vreizh, vol 3, p. 104. and implied an introduction of gabelle. All this created a broad front of discontent against the unprecedented brutality of the central State.

Biography Niermann was born in Bielefeld and studied philosophy in Berlin. He has lived in Berlin, to the eastern part of which he allegedly moved in late 1989. Niermann lived in New York between 2013‚Äì14, before moving to Basel, Switzerland, where he is currently based. Publications Although mostly known for his book releases (see below), Niermann earlier contributed to German newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He has also conducted interviews for German literary magazine Der Freund and contributed a series of interviews labelled Die Beste aller Welten [~ \\"The best of all worlds imaginable\\"] to the German art magazine Monopol. In 1999, Niermann first contributed a short story (10 000 Jahre [10,000 years]) to the anthology \\"Mesopotamia\\" edited by Swiss writer Christian Kracht. His debut novel Der Effekt was published in 2001. It were mainly these two publications that established a perceived link with Germany‚Äôs 1990s \\"pop literature\\" movement. Niermann successfully veered from this perception with his acclaimed 2003 book Minusvisionen [best translated as \\"Negative-only visions\\"; also a neologism in German], published by Suhrkamp. The book revived the literary form of the protocol (German \\"Protokoll\\"), drawing on motives of interview and oral history. It chronicles the visions, projects and (economic) failure of several young German entrepreneurs. In 2006, Umbauland appeared, also at Suhrkamp. It presents ten ideas of Niermann ‚Äì partly conceived with friends and colleagues ‚Äì on how Germany could be and should be radically reformed. Suggestion include the construction of a large- scale pyramid as tourist attraction and grave site in Eastern Germany, nuclear armament, or a radical re-vamping of the German language (\\"Rededeutsch\\"). Late February 2007 saw the publication of Metan [\\"Methane\\", misspelled], the product of teaming up with Christian Kracht and climbing up Kilimanjaro.See also the illustrated reportage by Kracht and Niermann, \\"Kilimanjaro\\", in Qvest, vol. 23 (December 2006/January 2007), p. 59-71. The book describes the mysterious power of methane gas. Another reviewer refers to the book as a parody of \\"alarmism\\" and suggested it should be taken as a joke: \\"But if this book is taken as a joke, it probably is not a bad one.\\"Christoph Bartmann, \\"Eine gro√üe Weltatemtheorie\\", S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 16 April 2007, p. 16. It has been translated into several languages, such as Latvian and Russian. Scholarly voicesHuber, Till (in press). [Ausweitung der Kunstzone.

K√∂ln/Weimar/Wien:B√∂hlau have suggested to read particularly Metan but also Niermann‚Äôs other offerings as indication of a camp take on public and political issues. As a result of two stays in Beijing, PR China, Niermann published another chronicle book, China ruft Dich (China is calling you) in early 2008. The book records the stories, experiences and perceptions of German and other non-Chinese expatriates who have decided to pursue life in rapidly changing China of the 00 years. Niermann flanks these reports (or protocols) with Chinese views, for example by renowned artist Ai Weiwei. Also in 2008, Niermann‚Äôs take on the miscellanea wave, entitled The Curious World of Drugs (Breites Wissen) and co-authored with journalist Adriano Sack was published by Plume (US; UK publisher: Turnaround). Niermann's other titles include: David Lieske: I Tried to Make this Work (Montez Press, 2015); Concentration (ed.) (Fiktion, 2015); and Breites Wissen ‚Ä¶ nachgelegt. Die seltsame Welt der Drogen und ihrer Nutzer (with Adriano Sack) (Rogner & Bernhard, 2015). Solution series Since 2008, Niermann functions as series editor of Solutions (original publications in English), published by Sternberg press and designed by Zak Kyes. In the series, Niermann together with Jens Thiel published Solution 9: The Great Pyramid, with contributions by Rem Koolhaas, Ai Weiwei, Christian Kracht, David Woodard, and others. Niermann's own titles in the series include the books Solution 1‚Äì10: Umbauland (2009), Solution 186‚Äì195: Dubai Democracy (2010), Solution 264‚Äì274: Drill Nation (2015), the novel Solution 257: Complete Love (2016), Solution 275‚Äì294: Communists Anonymous (2017) and Solution 295‚Äì304: Mare Amoris (2019). The ninth volume in the Solution series appeared in 2013: Solution 247‚Äì261: Love (edited by Ingo Niermann, with contributions by Douglas Coupland, Eva Illouz, Ben Marcus, Beatriz Preciado, Etel Adnan, Momus, David Pearce, and others). Other artistic and editorial activities In 2004, Niermann together with artist Antje Majewski curated the exhibition Atomkrieg [‚ÄúNuclear War‚Äù] at the Kunsthaus Dresden. 2007 saw the Great Pyramid Monument project as outlined in Umbauland (see above) gain momentum. In October 2008, Niermann had his first solo exhibition as an artist entitled JOIN THE U.S. ARMY at ZERN Gallery, Berlin. In 2010, Niermann wrote and co-produced the documentary The Future of Art, followed by the book The Future of Art. A Manual published by Sternberg Press. Vote: Gwangju folly with Rem Koolhaas (opening Sept. 2013): \\"Architect Rem Koolhaas and writer Ingo Niermann address public participation.

Retrieved 2014-08-18. Niermann is the co-founder of the digital publishing project Fiktion, established by German- and English-language writers in cooperation with Haus der Kulturen der Welt. Fiktion experimentally rejects the economic necessities of the publishing business: all titles are digital and distributed free of charge at www.fiktion.cc. In 2016, Niermann started an ongoing art-video collaboration with filmmaker Alexa Karolinski. Their film Army of Love premiered at the 9th Berlin Biennale. It has since been included in exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou, MACBA, Castello di Rivoli, as well as CCCB and the Wiesbaden Biennale. Their second installment of the series, OCEANO DE AMOR, was part of a three month exhibition Auto Italia gallery in London, and it had its world premiere at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen in March 2020. In 2020, Niermann premiered his video \\"Sea Lovers\\" at the \\"Countryside ‚Äì The Future\\" exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.

Founded in 1880, the Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium enjoys a reputation for academic excellence in the greater Frankfurt area. It is one of only a few schools which prepare students in 12 instead of the usual 13 years for the state-wide university preparatory examination, the Abitur, and its students consistently achieve the highest average grade among Frankfurt's secondary schools. The Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium emphasizes classical education in ancient and modern languages. Is one of only two schools in Frankfurt that teach Latin and ancient Greek. Latin is compulsory for all students from the fifth to the ninth grade. Ancient Greek, French or Italian must be selected as a third foreign language from the eighth grade onward.  History  The Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium was founded in 1888 as the Kaiser Friedrich Gymnasium. Patron of the school was Kaiser Friedrich III, who ruled at that time in Germany. After the Second World War, the school's name was changed to Staatliches Gymnasium Frankfurt am Main. The school was given its current name on the centenary of the establishment of the Frankfurt Parliament, the first freely elected parliament for all of Germany, after its president, Heinrich Freiherr von Gagern (1799-1880). In memory of Heinrich Freiherr von Gagern, students of the school created a sandstone sculpture, the Gagern Monument, which stands in the schoolyard since November 1998. The large frescoes in the assembly hall were made by Wilhelm Steinhausen, completed in 1906 when the school was founded. They are a rare example of fresco paintings in the time of the Art Nouveau. A modern extension adjoining the old building was built on the site of the Samson-Raphael-Hirsch-Schule, which is commemorated by bronze plaques from 1989 and 2001. Since 2008, the school is located on Bernhard-Grzimek-Allee. The former western section of the street \\"Am Tiergarten\\" was renamed in honor of zoologist Bernhard Grzimek.  School directors  Heinrich Weinstock (1926‚Äì1949) Helmuth Fleckenstein (1962‚Äì1984) G√ºnther Walter (1984‚Äì1999) Thomas Mausbach (1999‚Äì2018) Gerhard K√∂hler (2018‚Äìaktuell)  Gymnasium  Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium offers Abitur after twelve years. Among Frankfurt schools, Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium consistently ranks first place for highest average Abitur grades.  Planetarium  In 1989, a planetarium with a 3.2 meter dome was designed and built as part of a school project week. From this project, an astronomy working group was formed, which rebuilt the planetarium in 1999. The stars are represented by the hole projection method and are fully represented up to the 3rd size, as well as some stars of the 4th size. An additional projector for the planets was added in May 2007.  Detlef Kittstein Hall  The sports hall was planned by the Frankfurt architect Zvonko Turkali and inaugurated in autumn 2007. The building combines two gyms, one on top of the other, to conserve space. While the upper hall receives daylight thanks to a skylight, the lower hall is lit by a glass front. A wall design in the stairwell symbolizes the chestnut tree in the schoolyard. The sports hall bears the name of former hockey player Detlev Kittstein, who graduated from the school in 1967 and was a PE teacher at the school from 1969 until his death in 1996. He was a member of the German national field hockey team, with which he became European champion in 1970 and Olympic champion in 1972.  Student Council  The student body of Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium is represented by a democratically elected student council. Each year, a council president and two representatives are elected. These divide the work to be carried out into different areas. Once a year, all class / course representatives are invited to a general meeting, which then selects students in various positions: upper / middle / lower form speakers, various committees and city council spokespersons.  Abitur results  The Abitur results of the students of the Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium have been considerably higher than average since the inception of the state-wide Abitur in Hesse in 2007 and are always among the best in the city of Frankfurt. In 2013, 153 students graduated from high school with an average grade of 2.06. In total, 7 students passed the Abitur with an average of 1.0. The Hesse average was 2.43.  Orchestra and choir  At the Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium there are a small, middle and large orchestra, a lower form choir for grades 5 and 6, a mixed choir, a teachers' choir and various jazz groups and big bands. Each year, the school music groups perform music in the subway to collect money for cancer treatment. The tradition started in 1986 after a popular teacher died of cancer. The students played at South Station one last time the songs that they had practiced for his funeral. Passers-by who spontaneously wanted to donate money awoke the idea of playing Christmas carols regularly in the pre-Christmas period. Every year since, the students have played carols in the B-level of the Hauptwache subway station, and have collected and donated a total of over EUR 400,000 to two children's cancer foundations in Frankfurt and Jena.  Working groups (AGs)  In addition to its musical groups, the school offers numerous other working groups (AGs) in languages, astronomy, photography, computer science, physics, sports and a school medical service. The Theater AG, led by Hans- Martin Scholder, regularly performs classic plays in (post-) modern staging.  Clubs  Small orchestra grades 5-7 Intermediate orchestra grades 7-9 Large orchestra grades 10-13 Jazz - Club grades 8-13 Jazz Combo grades 5-7 Choir grades 5-6 Mixed choir grades 7-13 Theater Project grades 6-13 Photography club grades 5-13 Drama Group grades 6-10 Astronomy Club grades 9-13 Internet Club grades 8-13 Info / Math Club grades 9-13 Technology AG grades 8-13 MUN (Model United Nations) grades 8-13 Paramedic Club LMF Club grades 5-13 Youth debating grades E8 - 13 Debating Seniors: grades E8 - 13 Spanish beginners grades E-Q Spanish Beginners: grades E-Q Advanced Spanish grade Q Climbing grades 5-6 Chess Club grades 5-13 Fencing  Association of Alumni and Friends  The Association of Alumni and Friends of Heinrich von Gagern Gymnasium (formerly Kaiser-Friedrichs-Gymnasium) e.V. was founded in 1906 and is now an integral part of the school. In 2006, in the presence of Mayor Petra Roth, the guest of honor as well as numerous members celebrated the 100th anniversary of the association. The association has more than 650 members consisting of alumni (1924 to today), former teachers and other friends of the school from throughout Germany and abroad. The association organizes regular museum tours, lectures, an alumni day and walks. A bulletin, published four times a year, informs about its activities as well as about news at the Heinrich-von-Gagern- Gymnasium. The association is co-editor of the annual report of the school. Through the financial support of the Alumni Association, several major projects were made possible over the years at the Heinrich-von-Gagern- Gymnasium.

Despite strong local pressure at times during the 20th century, none of the proposals have come to fruition.  Background  Wainuiomata is in an isolated valley separated from Petone and Lower Hutt by the Eastern Hutt hills. In the 19th and early 20th centuries this isolation made communication difficult and a railway was desired to provide more efficient access to the outside world. As roads improved and car ownership rates rose during the 20th century, this function of a proposed railway declined, but at the same time the population of Wainuiomata increased and commuters to Wellington desired a railway line. However, the terrain is not favourable for a railway. A line into Wainuiomata would require either a steep route over the hills, resulting in a slow journey, or a lengthy and costly tunnel. This geography has been the main contributing factor to the rejection of all proposals so far.  Proposals  1870 proposal = The first proposal for a railway to Wainuiomata came as part of a route for the Wairarapa Line across the Rimutaka Range. Four routes were surveyed, including one through Wainuiomata. It was suggested by a Mr Sinclair, who farmed in the area and claimed he knew a route over the Rimutakas. The line surveyed by John Rochfort and his party ran from Kaitoke, at the northern end of the Hutt Valley, across the Eastern Hutt Hills into the valley of the Wainuiomata River, which it followed before crossing into the valley of the Orongorongo River. To leave the Orongorongo River and reach the Wairarapa, the line had to follow a tributary stream to a height of approximately 344.5 m (1130 feet), from which it faced a sudden and insurmountable drop to the Wairarapa. Accordingly, the proposal was given no further consideration.W. N. Cameron, Rimutaka Railway: Extracts from \\"A Line of Railway\\" (Wellington: New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society, 1992), 12. The circuitous nature of the route via Kaitoke meant an abbreviated form of this proposal was never subsequently considered for a line to Wainuiomata. = 1920s proposal = In order to enhance links between the Hutt Valley and the Wainuiomata Valley, then under development, and to cater for the needs of expected future residential development in the Wainuiomata Valley, a tunnel between the two valleys was proposed in 1928. On 2 July, an internal Railways Department memorandum noted of the proposal, made by the mayor of Lower Hutt in a recent meeting with the department: Preliminary negotiations with affected land owners were commenced in September. An agreement was entered into between the department and the development company on 1 October, which set out the terms of the project and made the following points: * The development company would construct a two- lane road tunnel, 55 chains in length, between Gracefield Road and the Wainuiomata Valley. * The Railways Department would be granted the exclusive right to operate motor or electrical services through the tunnel. * The development company would reserve sufficient land in the Wainuiomata Valley for terminal purposes for any services operated by the Railways Department through the tunnel. * The company was to reserve a strip of land along the new main road through the company‚Äôs subdivision for the possible future installation of an electrical tramway. * The Railways Department would commence operating a bus service from the Wainuiomata Valley to Wellington, Lower Hutt and Petone via the tunnel once there was a permanent resident population in the Wainuiomata Valley of at least 50 families. * The Railways Department would, when the amount of traffic was sufficient to justify it, construct at its own expense an electrical tramway from Gracefield Road to the Wainuiomata subdivision. In early 1929 the Railways Department encountered difficulties in trying to arrange for the acquisition of some of the required land from Morley & Co. Mr C. Morley had purchased the land while visiting New Zealand in 1927, and with a specific purpose for the land in mind was unwilling to exchange with the land sought by the department or be compensated for it. On being notified by the department that it intended to indefinitely postpone negotiations for the purchase of the affected land, Morley thanked them by letter on 23 May 1929 for their candour and advised that he intended to proceed with his intentions for the land. Though planning work for another facet of the project, the widening of Park Road, continued for several months, it appears that by the following year work on the project had ceased. = 1950s developments = Wainuiomata road tunnel, which was expected to provide additional business for the Gracefield Branch. It never opened to road traffic. A missive from the District Engineer's Office in 1952 concerning the industrial development at Seaview also covered the possible future transport needs of the Wainuiomata Valley, which at the time had not long been under development as a residential and industrial area. The District Engineer made the point that the floor of the Wainuiomata Valley was some 300 ft higher than that of the Hutt Valley, and he thus considered that it would be improbable for Wainuiomata to ever have a rail link. However, he did consider that the expected completion of the road tunnel then under construction would make for much easier road access into Wainuiomata. As the Hutt Valley portal of the tunnel was near Gracefield Station (off the end of Tunnel Grove), it would be prudent to consider the possibility of the increased importance of the Hutt Valley Industrial Line to serve Wainuiomata. To this end, he suggested various works and railways facilities that would be required to handle this traffic, including: * Road overbridges for Park Road and Seaview Road, both of which were expected to become arterial thoroughfares. * Relocation of the branch line to facilitate the construction of the Seaview Road overbridge. * Installation of passenger platforms at Gracefield Station and related facilities. * Provision of a marshalling yard, local sidings, goods shed, heavy crane, and other freight handling facilities for Gracefield Station. * A straight shunting leg southward from the Gracefield Station yard with parallel track or tracks for passenger traffic. = 1963 report = Residential development of the Wainuiomata Valley had been happening only for about a decade when, in 1963, the New Zealand Geological Survey prepared a report for the Wellington City Council on options for a Wainuiomata rail link for consideration for a regional plan for Greater Wellington. There was no expectation at the time that road transport would be able to adequately serve the public transport needs of Wainuiomata, thus a rail link was considered to be a very real possibility. Selecting a route was complicated by various considerations. The maximum permissible grade for a freight-carrying railway was about 1:40, which limited options for taking a line over the hills surrounding the valley. Such a line would have almost certainly required heavy earthworks and/or one or more short tunnels. The floor of the Wainuiomata Valley is some 350 ft higher than that of the Hutt Valley, so routes involving a tunnel through the hills were also limited. Both Woburn and Waterloo stations were rejected as possible junctions with a branch line, as they were considered to be too far from the hills. The first route to be considered was a branch line from Epuni, climbing the side of the hills in the Hutt Valley, and passing through a tunnel near the present hill road before dropping into the Wainuiomata Valley. The ruling grade would have been about 1:60, and would possibly have required a second short tunnel to pass through a spur. Negative points for this option included the fact that it would have to pass through an appreciable amount of developed land, and a requirement for heavy earthworks. The second and more favourable route would have started at Naenae, passed Taita Cemetery, around the head of Rata Street, through a spur by cutting or tunnel, then through the main tunnel at the head of Seddon Street. The ruling grade would have been about 1:45, but could have been reduced with more earthworks. Positive points for this option included the fact that it would have passed through less developed land, and would have had the secondary benefit of serving the industrial areas of Naenae and Taita. = 1975 report = On 4 August 1975, the Wainuiomata County Borough Council wrote to the Minister of Railways requesting that a feasibility study into a possible Waiuiomata ‚Äì Hutt Valley rail link be conducted. Citing population growth in the Wainuiomata Valley and increasing traffic volumes, it proposed a line from the Hutt Industrial Branch (Gracefield Branch) to The Strand in Wainuiomata. The line would be approximately 3 kilometres long, on a gradient of 1:40, and almost entirely in tunnel. It was expected that such a service would result in significant fuel savings by transferring passenger journeys that would have used road transport to rail, and would also reduce journey times for commuters between Wainuiomata and Wellington to no more than 30 minutes by avoiding traffic congestion. Railways Department Projects Engineer R. S. Ryan produced a preliminary study on the proposal on 11 August which included estimates and more detail on issues such as expected patronage, service requirements, facilities, route, cost, and revenue. The report, using work done on the Auckland Rapid Transit project, assumed that six three-car electric multiple units, each with 300 passengers, would be required to meet peak-hour demand. In order to operate services at 15-minute intervals, some trains would consist of six cars, others three. Trains from Wainuiomata would run through to Wellington, connecting with Wairarapa trains at Ava and Petone. Best Street and Bryan Heath Park were considered to be the most suitable sites for the terminus, being in the vicinity of several important routes through the valley, with the possibility of an extension to Moores Valley Road. A new station at Gracefield was recommended for access to the industrial and residential areas there. The route would involve the completion of the \\"triangle\\" at the Woburn end of the Gracefield Branch to give direct access from Wellington to the branch line, avoiding the need to reverse from Woburn station. After crossing the Waiwhetu Stream and passing through Ministry of Works land between Hutt Park Road and Gracefield Road, the line would enter a tunnel at a grade of 1:40 and emerge at the terminus. This grade would need to be maintained for the entire distance between the Ministry of Works land and the terminus to ensure that the gradient did not exceed 1:40. The report concluded that the project, while possible, would cost $30m to $35m (approximately $235m to $275m in 2008 prices), with operational and other costs of $760,000 per year and net revenue of $175,000 per year. The Chief Civil Engineer responded to the Wainuiomata Council on 14 August refusing its request for a feasibility study, explaining that the department did not have sufficient resources, either financially or in personnel, to commit to the detailed study that would be required to determine the practicability of the proposal. Citing information from the preliminary report, he pointed out that at current fare levels such a service would run at a considerable loss, and he did not expect that it could be budgeted for within the next 10 years. Following the rebuff from the Railways Department, the Council resolved at a meeting on 8 September to approach the Public Works Department with the same request for a feasibility study. Despite these efforts, no further work was undertaken on the proposal.

As such, it was the basis for the raising of armies and the exercise of justice.Mathieu Arnoux, \\"Ban, Banality\\", in Andr√© Vauchez (ed.), Encyclopedia of the Middle Age (James Clarke and Co., 2002 [Oxford Reference Online, 2005]). The word is of Germanic origin and first appears in fifth-century law codes. Under the Franks it was a royal prerogative, but could be delegated and, from the tenth century, was frequently usurped by lesser nobles.Theodore Evergates, \\"Ban, Banalit√©\\", in Joseph R. Strayer (ed.), Dictionary of the Middle Ages (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), vol. 2, p. 69. The adjective \\"banal\\" or \\"bannal\\" describes things pertaining to the ban. Its modern sense of \\"commonplace\\" (even \\"trite\\") derives from the fact that tenants were frequently required to use common mills, presses, ovens, etc. for the benefit of their lord exercising his banal rights.\\"banal, adj.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, January 2018. Accessed 18 February 2018. Merovingian and Carolingian eras Under the Merovingian dynasty (481‚Äì751), the ban was used mainly by the kings to summon free men to military service.Theodore Evergates, \\"Ban, Banalit√©\\", in W. W. Kibler and G. A. Zinn (eds.), Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1995), pp. 175‚Äì76. In the late eighth and early ninth century, under the Carolingian dynasty (751‚Äì987), a series of capitularies defined the ban's three components: the right to defend the defenceless, that is, churches, widows and orphans; jurisdiction over violent crimes such as murder, rape and arson; and the right to summon free men for military service. In the ninth century, the exercise of banal power was often delegated to the counts (Latin comites), who were royal appointees and exercised the power in public courts called placita. The ban was also often delegated to prelates whose ecclesiastical jurisdictions had been granted royal immunity. One of the duties of a count was to summon the people to swear an oath to the king.Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c.800‚Äìc.1100 (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 22. The counts combined their banal authority with the management of the royal fisc and the collection of taxes and were thus the king's representatives in every aspect of his public authority. Under the Carolingians, the ban itself still retained a primarily military significance. Since the counts had charge of the public fortresses in their counties, their ability to recruit and command men was critical to garrisoning these fortresses and defending the kingdom. Banal lordship The historian Georges Duby first used the phrase \\"banal lordship\\" (French seigneurie banale) to describe the development of a form of lordship based not merely on the ownership of land but on the bannum. This had its origins in West Francia (France) in the late tenth century. First, the commanders of the public fortresses‚Äîcastellans‚Äîwere delegated or else usurped the authority of the counts. Powerful landlords likewise usurped public authority, sometimes even usurping the ban over monasteries that had received ecclesiastical immunities. The ban thus came to refer to both the authority and the district (smaller than a county) over which it was exercised. The authority to summon men for military service extended to labour service in the upkeep of roads, bridges and castles. This in turn justified levying of tolls on the use of roads, bridges and fords. Eventually, labour service, called corv√©e, was demanded on the castellan or lord's own land, his demesne. The use of common land, such as ponds, forests and pastures, was regulated by the lord and could likewise be described as banal. There were in the end few limits to what a lord could justify as a banality. The primary meaning of the ban remained for a long time, however, the ability to summon to court and to dispense justice. As a result of the \\"privatising\\" of the ban, the word itself acquired a new expanded meaning by the early eleventh century. It was an \\"unrestricted territorial authority\\" and \\"the whole of the powers enjoyed by the castellan lord over the men of his district[,] a general power of constraint, whose forms varied according to times and regions.\\" The word bannum was gradually displaced in its original meaning of the right to command by the Latin terms districtus and potestas in northern France and mandamentum in southern France by the twelfth century. This left the term bannum only its newly acquired sense of economic monopoly power. There came to be three common powers the lord exercised per bannum: the power to compel subjects to use the lord's mill for their grain, the lord's oven for their bread and the lord's winepress for their grapes. A fourth power, called the banvin, the right to compel subjects to buy the lord's wine during prescribed periods, was described as ad bannum. These \\"banalities\\" were not uniform throughout France. Banal mills, for example, were more common in the north and ovens more common in the south. Payment for the use of the banal mill, oven and press was usually in kind and proportional to use, e.g. every sixth loaf to the lord or one twentieth of the wine processed. This made the ban an important source of revenue, since it was tied to productivity and commodity prices, both of which rose throughout the thirteenth century while tenurial rents were fixed by custom and thus remained low. Banal revenues could be granted in whole or in part as knight's fees, and thus supported the professionalisation of military service.

Diplomatic relations among two countries were established on March 9, 1992 following Croatia's independence from SFR Yugoslavia. Croatia has an embassy in Madrid and honorary consulates in Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Pamplona and Seville. Spain has an embassy in Zagreb and consulate in Dubrovnik. The two nations enjoy largely positive relations. Both countries are predominantly Catholic. Both countries are full members of the European Union and NATO. History Croatia‚ÄìSpain relations date far back into history, at least as early as the 16th century. During 1516-18 Uskok War, Spanish Empire officially sided with the Kingdom of Croatia against Venice and Ottoman Empire. =During The Spanish Civil War= Many Croats participated in Spanish Civil War, mostly on the side of Republicans, including Josip Broz Tito who later become president of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Croatian public was very sensitive about the Spanish Civil War which was well covered in the Croatian media and political arena. Youth members of the Party of Rights sent a telegram of support to Francisco Franco, a Nationalist, while League of Communists of Yugoslavia began to send volunteers to help Republicans. Party or Catholic media, such as Hrvatska stra≈æa (right wing) or Proleter (left wing), were bringing information in accordance with their ideology. While Hrvatska stra≈æa was writing daily about the persecution of religion and crimes committed by Republicans and was calling for \\"a joint fight against the red danger and ghosts of atheism\\", Proleter was writing about crimes committed by Nationalists and was calling for \\"an international fight against the scourge of fascism\\" and was denouncing the church as co-responsible for crimes. The left wing press was constantly emphasizing the importance of fighting for the national rights of Catalans, Basques and others, comparing it with bad status of Croats in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, while the right wing (Usta≈°e) press, while fighting against Serbian unitarianism within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, hadn't paid much attention to aspirations of Catalans and Basques in Spain. The Catholic Church was constantly emphasizing the anti-religious and anti- clerical character of Republicans, depicting Franco as protector of the faith, Church, and the Christian tradition. = Post WWII = After the Second World War and the destruction of the Nazi puppet state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia, Spain, led by Francisco Franco, accepted a lot of those which fled from the liberated territory, and newly founded Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including dictator Ante Paveliƒá and his family. = Present Status = Spain provided strong support to the Croatian ascension to the EU. On July 1, 2013, Spain welcomed Croatian EU ascension by hanging festive red cravat, invented by Croats, on the Cibeles Palace. Economic cooperation In 2013 Croatia exported ‚Ç¨40,800,000 worth of goods to Spain and imported from it ‚Ç¨234,300,000 worth of goods.

Brenton became famous in the aftermath of the war, when he published the Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822 in 1823. The book was popular, but Brenton was criticised at the time and since for his failure to distinguish between fact and rumour as well as his partisan political leanings. In Brenton's later life, he was heavily involved in charitable enterprises in the poorer areas of London with mixed success. Naval career Brenton was born in 1774 in Rhode Island to Admiral Jahleel Brenton and his wife Henrietta. His elder brother, also named Jahleel, later became a celebrated naval commander and admiral. The Brenton's were American loyalists and emigrated to Britain during the American War of Independence, where Edward joined the Royal Navy in 1788 aged 14. In the Navy, Brenton spent time serving in the East Indies and the Channel Fleet, being promoted to lieutenant in 1795 and serving in the North Sea and off Newfoundland until 1802, when he was promoted to commander. In 1802 he was captain of the 18-gun ship-sloop Lark, taking her from Jamaica to the Channel. In 1803 he married Margaret Cox (daughter of General Thomas Cox) and had many children. At the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Brenton was given command of the small brig HMS Merlin, in which he operated in the English Channel, burning the wreck of HMS Shannon near Barfleur to prevent its seizure by the French in the same year. In January 1805, Brenton took command of the brig HMS Amaranthe in the North Sea and in 1808 moved to the West Indies, where he distinguished himself in an attack on a small French convoy off Martinique on 13 December, notably against Cygne. Promoted to post captain for this operation, Brenton briefly took temporary command of the post ship (May to September 1810), HMS Pompee, and then HMS Belleisle, before being confirmed in his brother's previous ship HMS Spartan in 1810. Spartan served in the War of 1812, although without participating in any actions, and Brenton was placed in reserve in 1813, returning briefly to service in 1815 before retiring permanently. Historical career Following his time in the Navy, Brenton became a keen if controversial historian, publishing his five volume Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822 in 1823 and the Life and Correspondence of John, Earl of St. Vincent in 1838. Brenton's works were controversial, because he rarely attempted to sift fact from rumour, provoking an outcry from those affected by these, often inaccurate, revelations. Particularly scathing of Brenton was William James, whose alternative history of the naval campaigns of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars was published in 1827. James was a political rival of Brenton and a civilian who had never served in the Navy, and the men exchanged very public disagreements over points of fact. Brenton's other passion was for charitable works, publishing many pamphlets and setting up schemes to aid the poor, particularly the \\"Society for the Relief of Shipwrecked Mariners\\" and the \\"Children's Friend Society\\", neither of which achieved their aims and provoked criticism of Brenton's methods. This experience left him bitter in the years approaching his death in April 1839 at his home in York Street, London. He was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church, with his wife and 100 boys of the Children's Friend Society among the mourners.Brenton, Edward Pelham, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 18 December 2008 The year before his death, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1838 Coronation Honours.

As the first fully residential school in East Malaysia and the 27th of its kind in Malaysia, SMESH was previously known as Sekolah Berasrama Penuh Sabah (SBPS). SMESH was established in 1978 but became fully operational on 1 January 1984. It has a permanent campus in Bukit Padang, Kota Kinabalu. Due to the unsafe state of the campus, SMESH is temporarily operated in a temporary campus in Tuaran.  History  The idea of having a fully residential school in Sabah was initiated in 1970s. Although SBPS was established in 1978, SBPS started its operation on 1 January 1984 under the leadership of its Founding Principal, Mohd. Radzwan Mohd. Yusof with the assistance of one teacher, Abd Halim Ismail. The first group of SBPS students were enrolled on 26 May 1984. SBPS was renamed as SMESH by the Ministry of Education (MOE) on 12 April 1997. Prior to 2011, SMESH was made a Smart School and a Cluster of Excellence School. On 26 May 2011, Education Minister Muhyiddin Yassin declared SMESH a High Performance School. As such, SMESH was given considerable autonomy powers from MOE. For many years, including in 2018, SMESH was ranked the best secondary school in Sabah based on public examination results achieved by students and the school. In 2014, SMESH became the second best school in Malaysia based on Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) 2013 results. In 2015, Ministry of Works declared the permanent campus of SMESH in Kota Kinabalu unsafe. Consequently, SMESH was relocated to Tuaran. The old campus of Kent Teaching Education Institute was set up as the temporary campus of SMESH at the end of 2015. In March 2018, Education Minister Mahdzir Khalid announced that RM 72 million was provided rebuild the permanent campus under Najib Government. Assistant Minister of State Jimmy Wong later revealed, in July 2018, that the real cost of rebuilding the permanent campus is RM 74.2 million and that the project is still at pre-implementation level. In July 2018, SMESH was selected as the second school in Malaysia and the first in Sabah to go cashless by MobilityOne.  Leadership  SMESH is led by a senior-grade Principal appointed by MOE. He is later assisted by a Management Council comprising all three Vice Principals and four Head of Departments. Since the inception of SBPS/SMESH in 1984, six Principals took the helm of the school. Zaini Zair is the Principal of SMESH since 2008. The following principals preceded him: * 1984-1987: Mohd. Radzwan Mohd. Yusof * 1987-1994: Adnan Ibrahim * 1994-1996: Abbas Awang * 1997-2005: Wahid Kapal * 2005-2008: Rossminah Yamin  Facilities  In accordance with the status of SMESH as a top school in Sabah, SMESH was equipped with completed facilities. the permanent campus of SMESH has a main hall, four science labs, three workshops, a computer lab, a sports complex, a Muslim prayer hall and two blocks of student accommodation. In addition to Internet access points installed at strategic places around the school, students were given permission to bring own laptops to the school under a set of terms and conditions set by the school.  Achievements  Since 1984, SMESH has recorded numerous achievements at various fields and levels. In academic, SMESH was made the best school in Sabah for 2018 based on SPM 2017 results.

Weeper made his animated debut in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Tim Conway, and his live-action debut on the fourth season of The Flash, portrayed by Matt Afonso. Publication history The original Weeper first appeared in Master Comics #23 in February 1942. The arch-foe of Bulletman and Bulletgirl, the Weeper is capable of the most brutal of murders, but sheds tears for his victims; he hates to see people happy but feels bad after he hurts them. The Weeper wears a blue opera cape, a top hat, and carries a small walking stick and tear gas bombs. He also drives a hearse and is accompanied by his henchmen called the Bittermen. Fictional character biographyMortimer Gloom= Formerly known as the \\"Crying Clown\\" or \\"Weeping Willie,\\" Mortimer Gloom is fired for dishonesty from his work as a circus performer. Sometime afterward, he commits several acts of revenge. He then takes on the name \\"the Weeper\\". The Weeper sends letters and visits a number of families telling them tragic news. He tells one family their son has died in the war. In another family, the father is fired from his job after years of dutiful service. In yet another family, he tells the husband his business has burned to the ground. Later, the families discover that the Weeper has lied to them. The Weeper tells these lies so he could either case the families' homes for robbery or they would lead him to where they hid their valuable possessions. The Weeper puts an ad in the paper looking for men who feel life has given them a raw deal. A lot of men reply to the ad. He interviews them all and picks ten of the saddest men. He calls them the Bittermen. The Weeper, along with the Bittermen, sets out to make the lives of other people very unhappy. They start by riding through a parade in a hearse and tossing tear gas into the crowd. This causes a stampede which kills a great many people. The Weeper drives through the street littered with dead bodies, weeping at that horrible tragedy. The Weeper and the Bittermen commit a series of ghastly acts. He succeeds in capturing Bulletgirl. However, Bulletman is able to save her and the Weeper is apparently drowned. Sometime after being defeated by Bulletman and Bulletgirl, the Weeper returns and looks to gather his Bittermen back together. One of them refuses, saying he makes enough money now to choke a horse and he is very happy. The Weeper replies saying he hates to hear that people are happy. The next day, the man is found dead after having choked on his wad of money. The Weeper then shows his other Bittermen the newspaper account of what has happened. Fearing for their lives, they join his group again. The Weeper is later betrayed by one of them. The Weeper, the Murder Prophet, and the Black Rat form the Revenge Syndicate. From Bulletman #7 (September 16, 1942). The Weeper is a founding member of the Revenge Syndicate. The Revenge Syndicate is started by the Murder Prophet and joined by the Weeper and the Black Rat. At first, they are at odds with each one wanting to be the chief of the group. The Weeper comes up with the idea that they roll dice to see who would be chief; the person with the highest roll would go first, the person with the second highest would go second, and the person with the third highest would go last. The Murder Prophet wins the first roll. His plan is to rob an art museum by pretending to be a visitor, with the aid of the Black Rat emerging from the sewer with a machine gun. Bulletman and Bulletgirl stop them, but they escape. The Weeper goes second. His plan is for the Murder Prophet to pretend to be a psychic at a carnival after kidnapping the real psychic. The Murder Prophet tells a rich woman to move her money so it will not be stolen. They are going to steal the money while it is being moved. Bulletman and Bulletgirl stop them after realizing their plot. They lift the car the villains are in and throw it into a lake. The Black Rat is thrown in also and saves the Murder Prophet and the Weeper. The three realize that Bulletman has always thwarted their plans and they need to eliminate him if they ever want to succeed. The Black Rat meets several criminals who agree to pay $100,000 if he gets rid of Bulletman. The Black Rat goes third. His plan is to send out a radio broadcast to lure Bulletman to an abandoned shack. They set up a dummy of the Black Rat. Bulletman and Bulletgirl go inside the shack. The Revenge Syndicate goes inside and beats up Bulletman. To their surprise, Bulletman has set up a dummy of his own. Bulletman and Bulletgirl beat them up and a fire is started when the radio is broken.Bulletman #7 (September 16, 1942) The Weeper returns a few months later on Thanksgiving Day and is captured by Bulletman, Bulletgirl, and their new ally Bulletdog.Bulletman #10 (December 16, 1942) Weeper eventually died between 1942 and 1946. =Unknown= The second Weeper (right) and Dr. Riddle threaten Susan Kent (a.k.a. Bulletgirl). From Mary Marvel #8 (December, 1946). At some point between 1942 and 1946, the Weeper dies and is replaced by his son, the second Weeper. In 1946, Bulletgirl and her friend Mary Marvel fight the second Weeper and Dr. Riddle. The second Weeper says, \\"My father, the true Weeper, is dead -- Sob! But I am carrying on with his name!\\" They first try to hang Bulletgirl in her civilian identity of Susan Kent after surprising her and pulling her up with a noose and the Weeper tries to stab her also, but Mary Marvel stops them, as she was with Susan when the villains attacked. The villains escape while Mary frees Susan from the noose and she changes to Bulletgirl; however, a riddle left behind allows the two to track the villains to an abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. The Weeper saw Bulletgirl outside, but Riddle said that was part of his plan. First the Weeper went into another room with a straitjacket while Riddle waited for Bulletgirl. Bulletgirl knocked Riddle over, not noticing the Weeper moving towards her. The Weeper placed the straitjacket on her from behind just after she decided to look for him. Then with Riddle's help, she was tied to a chair and gagged. The two villains then tell Bulletgirl they know that Mary is here also. Mary was lured in when she decided to look for Bulletgirl and stopped from speaking with a hose. While binding and gagging her, the Weeper talked about how he wept for Mary. The two villains carried the two heroines into a cell which they made airtight and left. Bulletgirl was able to remove Mary's gag with her helmet, allowing her to transform into Mary Marvel, free Bulletgirl, and break open a cell wall. The two superheroines found a riddle in the asylum and deciphered it, showing the duo were planning to rob a plane carrying gold bullion, and one of them would wait on the ground as the gold would be dropped. Mary Marvel flies after the plane after Riddle has knocked out the two pilots. Dr. Riddle is able to escape from the plane by parachute as Mary saves the plane, and knock out Bulletgirl by landing on her just as she has met Weeper II, but Mary Marvel then captures him and Bulletgirl gets the Weeper. They are then jailed.Mary Marvel #8 (December, 1946) The second Weeper teams up with the Earth-Two version of the Joker during King Kull's plan to wipe out humanity on three Earths. Members of Earth-One's Justice League and Earth-Two's Justice Society of America travel to Earth-S and meet Shazam's Squadron of Justice‚ÄîBulletman and Bulletgirl, Mister Scarlet and Pinky the Whiz Kid, Ibis the Invincible, and the Spy Smasher. The Joker teaches the Weeper his style of committing crimes on Earth-S, stealing jewels and transforming people into different materials, with his trademark grin, although the Weeper cannot understand why the Joker laughs about crime. They are stopped by the Earth-Two Batman, the Earth-Two Robin, Mister Scarlet and Pinky, who follow a trail left by jewels on the pavement. Robin is unaffected by the Weeper's tear gas because he is wearing contact lenses and the villains are imprisoned.Justice League of America #136 (October 1976) In other mediaTelevision= The Weeper as he appears on Batman: The Brave and the Bold. * The Mortimer Gloom version of Weeper appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Joker: The Vile and the Villainous!\\", voiced by Tim Conway. This depiction wields a cane capable of producing miniature rain clouds that make people give in to misery as well as handkerchiefs that can grow and entrap his opponents. The Joker encounters him in a Gotham City bar and recognizes him as the first villain to use a signature motif in all his crimes, enemy of Bulletman, and his inspiration for becoming a supervillain. When Batman unveils the Bat-Probe to thwart Gotham City's criminals, Joker proposes a partnership with Weeper, who agrees to help. While working together, the former also works to help the latter regain his villainous touch. The two of them attack S.T.A.R. Labs and fight Batman, however Weeper cannot bring himself to kill him, so Joker attempts to do so himself, only to accidentally destroy their lair. Weeper abandons Joker, though after the Bat- Probe becomes operational and makes his fellow villains' lives miserable, he returns to help Joker destroy the Bat-Probe. During a rematch against Batman, Weeper uses tear gas on him before disabling the Bat-Probe and turning on Joker in an attempt to take his place as the King of Crime, only for Batman to defeat both of the villains. * An unnamed metahuman nicknamed \\"The Weeper\\" appears in The Flash episode \\"Girls' Night Out\\", portrayed by Matt Afonso. Unlike the comics, this version is not a villain. He was one of 12 bus passengers who became metahumans after being exposed to dark matter when the Thinker arranged for the Flash to emerge from the Speed Force. After Blacksmith discovers that he can produce \\"love drug\\" tears, she captures him, only to be confronted and defeated by Killer Frost, Iris West, and Felicity Smoak, who help him escape. However, Weeper is later captured by the Thinker, so he can control his wife, Marlize DeVoe. =Film= Weeper appears in the 2018 direct-to-video animated movie Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

He was Union Minister for Ministry of Minority Affairs (India) under Manmohan Singh's government.Official biographical sketch in Parliament of India website. He started his career as active social worker in 1945. As a social worker his notable achievements include construction of (i) a jetty on the bank of Savitri river, Bankot (Khadi) Creek through local people offering free labor (shramdan in Marathi) to complete the task. He also worked with his own hands along with the villagers of Ambet; (ii) road between the village Ambet and Lonere Goregaon (then in Kolaba, now in Raigad district) to connect his village to NH-17. He had a keen interest in the uplifting of the weaker sections of the society and as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra had launched Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana (a monthly financial aid scheme for poor and destitute), pension and housing facilities for legislators and media persons, and many more initiatives. He had also announced that he would get back the Bhawani sword ‚Äî the sword used by iconic Maratha king Shivaji which now lies in the British Museum in London. He had to resign from the post of Chief Minister of Maharashtra due to allegations of his involvement in corruption. However, the Supreme Court cleared him of all allegations years later. The charges were seen as political ploy to malign him and arrest his political growth. When cleared by the Supreme Court, he said \\"I had done nothing wrong. I was targeted by political rivals but they failed. I suffered some setbacks, but they could not destroy me.\\" Antulay died from chronic Kidney failure on 2 December 2014 while being treated at the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai. Upon Antulay's demise, noted criminal lawyer J.P. Mishra, who represented Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ramdas Nayak in the corruption cases he had filed against Antulay, paid rich tributes to his old adversary. He acknowledged Antulay as \\"an administrator par excellence\\", whose heart always beat for the poor and downtrodden. \\"He was a truly great human being. He set up the trusts for the benefit of the poorest people in society, but they became his undoing. Even during the trial, he was always amiable and soft-spoken, never harbouring animosity or ill-will against anybody,\\" said Mishra, who is now the BJP North Mumbai unit president of the BJP. Literary works He has also published several books: * Parliamentary Privilege (compilation of his five articles published in the Times of India) ; * Mahajan Report - Uncovered; * Appointment of a Chief Justice; * Democracy- Parliamentary or Presidential? (compilation of his speeches and interviews).  Controversies  He resigned as Chief Minister of Maharashtra after the Bombay High Court convicted him of extortion on 13 January 1982. The court ruled that Antulay had illegally required Bombay area builders to make donations to Indira Gandhi Pratibha Pratishthan trust, one of several trust funds he had established and controlled, in exchange for receiving more cement than the quota allotted to them by the Government. He was later granted bail by the court. However, the Supreme Court later cleared him of the allegations. Again after November 2008 Mumbai attacks he has raised a controversy by saying that the end of Hemant Karkare, of the Anti-Terrorism Squad of Maharashtra, killed in the attacks, may be related to his investigation of the 2006 Malegaon blasts, leading to questions about the Mumbai attacks. Later he changed his stand and told Parliament he had not talked about who killed the police officers but about who \\"sent them in the wrong direction\\".Antulay clarifies, but Govt embarrassed still  Watch - India News - IBNLive His party, Congress, distanced itself from his statements.

From 1632 to 1635, he was steward of Burgundy and steward of the armies with Cardinal Louis de Nogaret of Valletta. He was unwise enough to link himself to cardinal Richelieu's enemies. His guilty deed between Anne of Austria and Marie de Rohan was pardoned, but he fell in the conspiracy between Spain and Cinq-Mars, a favorite of king Louis XIII. For not revealing what he knew of the conspiracy, his silence was taken as proof of guilt and he was beheaded at Lyon on the same day as Cinq-Mars on Richelieu's orders.Encyclop√©die Larousse du XXe sic√®le, Paris, 1932 He was a manuscript collector; his collection included the Greek minuscule manuscript known as Minuscule 601 (Gregory- Aland). A famous 19th century historical painting by Paul Delaroche shows Cardinal Richelieu in a gorgeous barge, preceding the boat carrying De Thou and Cinq-Mars to their execution.

The health management system (HMS) is an evolutionary medicine regulative process proposed by Nicholas Humphrey reprinted from in which actuarial assessment of fitness and economic-type cost‚Äìbenefit analysis determines the body‚Äôs regulation of its physiology and health. This incorporation of cost‚Äìbenefit calculations into body regulation provides a science grounded approach to mind‚Äìbody phenomena such as placebos that are otherwise not explainable by low level, noneconomic, and purely feedback based homeostatic or allostatic theories. * Many medical symptoms such as inflammation, fever, pain, sickness behavior, or morning sickness have an evolutionary medicine function of enabling the body to protect, heal or restore itself from injury, infection or other physiological disruption. * The deployment of self- treatments have costs as well as benefits with the result that evolution has selected management processes in the brain such that self-treatments are used only when they provide an overall cost‚Äìbenefit advantage. The brain controls such physiological process through top‚Äìdown regulation. * External treatment and the availability of support is factored into the health management system‚Äôs cost‚Äìbenefit assessment as to whether to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment. Placebos are explained as the result of false information about the availability of external treatment and support that mislead the health management system into not deploying evolved self-treatments. This results in the placebo suppression of medical symptoms. Evolutionary medicine Since Hippocrates, it has been recognized that the body has self- healing powers (vis medicatrix naturae). Modern evolutionary medicine identifies them with physiologically based self-treatments that provide the body with prophylactic, healing, or restorative capabilities against injuries, infections and physiological disruption. Examples include: * Immune responses * Fever * Sickness behavior * Nausea * Morning sickness * Diarrhea * Hypoferremia * Depression * Pain These evolved self-treatments deployed by the body are experienced by humans as unpleasant and unwanted illness symptoms. Deployment Such self-treatments according to evolutionary medicine are deployed to increase an individual‚Äôs biological fitness. Two factors affect their deployment. First, it is usually advantageous to deploy them on a precautionary basis. As a result, it will often turn out that they have been deployed apparently unnecessarily, though this has in fact been advantageous since in probabilistic terms they have provided an insurance against a potentially costly outcome. As Nesse notes: \\"Vomiting, for example, may cost only a few hundred calories and a few minutes, whereas not vomiting may result in a 5% chance of death\\" page 77. Second, self-treatments are costly both in using energy, and also in their risk of damaging the body. * Immunity ‚Äì energy for activating lymphocyte and antibody production, and in the risk of an immune response resulting in an immune related disorder. * Fever ‚Äì energy (each 1 ¬∞C raise in blood temperature increases energy expenditure by 10‚Äì15%. 90% of the total cost of fighting pneumonia goes on increased body temperature. There is also the risk of hyperpyrexia. * Sickness behavior ‚Äì restricted ability by an animal to forage and defend itself * Nausea ‚Äì loss of food nutrients, and potential risk of aspiration * Morning sickness ‚Äì loss of food nutrients when a mother needs additional, not less, nourishment * Hypoferremia ‚Äì impairment in biological processes needing iron resulting in iron deficiency anemia * Depression ‚Äì impaired activity and problem solving. * Pain ‚Äì restricted movement and the inability to concentrate One factor in deployment is low level physiological control by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 triggered by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Another is higher level control in which the brain takes into account what it learns about circumstances and how that makes it well and ill. Conditioning shows the existence of such learnt control: give saccharin paired in a drink with a drug that creates immunosuppression, and later on, giving saccharin alone will produce immunosuppression. Such conditioning happens both in experimental rodents and humans. Cost benefit analysis Economic resource management= Evolution, according to Nicholas Humphrey, has selected an internal health management system that uses cost benefit analysis upon whether the deployment of a self-treatment aids biological fitness, and so should be activated. > a specially designed procedure for ‚Äúeconomic resource management‚Äù that is, I > believe, one of the key features of the ‚Äúnatural health-care service‚Äù which > has evolved in ourselves and other animals to help us deal throughout our > lives with repeated bouts of sickness, injury, and other threats to our > well-being. An analogy is explicitly made with the health economics consideration used in management decisions involving external medical treatment. > Now, if you wonder about this choice of managerial terminology for talking > about biological healing systems, I should say that it is quite deliberate > (and so is the pun on NHS.) With the phrase ‚Äúnatural health-care service‚Äù I > do intend to evoke, at a biological level, all the economic connotations > that are so much a part of modern health-care in society. =External medications= External medications will affect the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved self-treatment. Some animals use external ones. Wild animals, including apes, do so in the form of ingested detoxifying clays, rough leaves that clear gut parasites, and pharmacologically active plants Complementary to this, research finds that animals have the ability to select and prefer substances that aid their recuperation from illness. =Social support= The welfare of social animals (including humans) depends upon other individuals (social buffering). The actuarial assessments of the costs and benefits of deploying a self-treatment therefore will depend upon the presence, or not, of other individuals. The presence of helpful others will affect, for example, the risk of predators when incapacitated, and‚Äîin those case in which animals do this (such as humans)‚Äîthe provision of food, and care during sickness. The health management system factors in the presence of such external treatment and social support as one aspect of the circumstances needed to determine whether it is advantageous to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment. PlacebosFalse information= All humans societies use external medications, and some individuals exist that are considered to have special healing knowledge about illnesses and their treatments. Humans are also usually supportive to those in their group. The availability of these things will affect the cost benefits of the body deploying its own biological ones. This could, in turn, lead to the health management system (given its beliefs (information) about treatments and support) to deploy or not, or doing so differently, the body‚Äôs own treatments. Nicholas Humphrey describes how the health management system explains placebos ‚Äì an external treatment without direct physiological effects ‚Äì as follows: > Suppose, for example, a doctor gives someone who is suffering an infection a > pill that she rightly believes to contain an antibiotic: because her hopes > will be raised she will no doubt make appropriate adjustments to her health- > management strategy ‚Äì lowering her precautionary defences in anticipation of > the sickness not lasting long. The health management system, in other words, when faced with an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is that the benefits of the self- treatment cease to outweigh its costs. As a result, it is not deployed, and an individual does not experience unwanted medical symptoms. =Lack of harm= Failure to deploy an evolved self-treatment need not put an individual at risk since evolution has advantaged their deployment on a precautionary basis. As Nicholas Humphrey notes: > many of the health-care measures we‚Äôve been discussing are precautionary > measures designed to protect from dangers that lie ahead in an uncertain > future. Pain is a way of making sure you give your body rest just in case > you need it. Rationing the use of the immune system is a way of making sure > you have the resources to cope with renewed attacks just in case they > happen. Your healing systems are basically tending to be cautious, and > sometimes over-cautious, as if working on the principle of better safe than > sorry. Therefore, not deploying an evolved self-treatment, and so not having a medical symptom due to placebo false information might be without consequence. Central governor The health management system‚Äôs idea of a top down neural control of the body is also found in the idea that a central governor regulates muscle fatigue to protect the body from the harmful effects (such as anoxia and hyperglycemia) of over prolonged exercise. The idea of a fatigue governor was first proposed in 1924 by the 1922 Nobel Prize winner Archibald Hill, and more recently, on the basis of modern research, by Tim Noakes. Like with the health management system, the central governor shares the idea that much of what is attributed to low level feedback homeostatic regulation is, in fact, due to top down control by the brain. The advantage of this top down management is that the brain can enhance such regulation by allowing it to be modified by information. For example, in endurance running, a cost-benefit trade-off exists between the advantages of continuing to run, and the risk if this is too prolonged that it might harm the body. Being able to regulate fatigue in terms of information about the benefits and costs of continued exercise would enhance biological fitness. Low level theories exist that suggest that fatigue is due mechanical failure of the exercising muscles (\\"peripheral fatigue\\"). However, such low level theories do not explain why running muscle fatigue is affected by information relevant to cost benefit trade offs. For example, marathon runners can carry on running longer if told they are near the finishing line, than far away. The existence of a central governor can explain this effect.

Over 400 Croatian citizens were evacuated from the country by early March. The Croatian Government supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya that started in late March, and temporarily closed the Tripoli embassy at the same time. Mesiƒá later made statements indicating suspicion NATO's motives in establishing the no-fly zone, which in turn angered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In late May, a Libyan diplomat in Zagreb made public statements supporting the Gaddafi regime and criticized Croatia for supporting the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.

He was bishop of Metz from 1697 to 1732, and duc de Coislin from 1710. Biography Great-grandson of chancellor S√©guier, brother of Pierre de Camboust and nephew of Pierre du Cambout de Coislin, on 20 June 1714 he composed a mandate denying the papal bull Unigenitus, which produced a sensation throughout the French church due to its author's personality, his diocese's importance and the sharpness of its condemnation of the bull, concealed beneath apparent submission to it. Louis XIV condemned the mandate by a Conseil decree of 5 July 1714 \\"as contrary to the acceptance of the Bull passed by the assembly of the clergy of France, and seeking to weaken or render useless the condemnation, both the errors contained in its 101 propositions, and the book that contains them\\". For refusing to seal this decree, chancellor de Pontchartrain was dismissed. Henri-Charles de Coislin was an honorary member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres and the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise (from 1710). He bequeathed to the abbaye de Saint-Germain the rich library he had himself inherited from chancellor S√©guier, whose remnants have since 1793 been reunited in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Bishop of France's most important stronghold, he relieved the city's burden of billeting soldiers by building a barracks on place du Champ at Seille - the barracks were bounded by 4 streets honouring the patron saints of Henri and his family (rue Saint Charles, rue Saint Henri, rue du Cambout and rue de Coislin). These barracks were demolished around 1930 to allow the construction of place Coislin (named after him), subsequently substantially rebuilt in the years after the Second World War to house a bus terminus, then a vast town-centre car park.

Ellen is a war widow living on a weatherbeaten midwestern farm with her young son Jeff and her father-in-law George Miller. The character was created by producer Robert Maxwell and Lassie trainer Rudd Weatherwax, and was portrayed in the series by Jan Clayton. Ellen makes her debut in the premiere episode, \\"The Inheritance\\" (1954) and her last appearance in the mid-fourth season episode, \\"Timmy's Family\\" (1957). Clayton was nominated for two Emmy Awards for her performances as Ellen Miller on Lassie, and the series itself won two Emmys during her stint on the show. Role Ellen Miller is a strong, loving, and intelligent woman. She is a widow whose husband John was killed in World War II. When the series opens, she lives on a small midwestern farm with her eleven-year-old son, Jeff and her father-in-law, George Miller. She attended college and entertains the daughter of a college friend in \\"The Ballerina.\\" She is a musician and sometimes plays the organ in the farmhouse parlor. In one episode, she is offered a job as a singer on a radio station. Ellen provokes the jealousies of both Jeff and her father-in-law when she dates the local constable, Clay Horton. Ellen and her family provide a foster home for a seven-year-old runaway boy called Timmy. Following the death of her father-in-law, she and her son sell the farm to the Martins (who adopt Timmy and Lassie), and move to the city where she plans to teach music and Jeff plans to attend a science high school. Production detailsBackground= In 1943, Eric Knight's fictional rough collie, Lassie, made her film debut in MGM's Lassie Come Home. The success of the film generated six more MGM Lassie films, and, with the seventh feature, The Painted Hills (1951), Lassie's MGM career came to an end. Pal, a male dog, played Lassie in all seven films, and, when his MGM career had run its course, Pal's owner and trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, took all rights to the Lassie name and trademark in lieu of back pay. Weatherwax and Pal then toured America in an 18-minute program re-enacting Lassie's film exploits. Producer Robert Maxwell convinced Weatherwax that the dog's future lay in television. The men developed a television scenario set on a small midwestern farm about a struggling war widow, her son, and her father-in-law.Collins, Ace. Lassie: A Dog's Life. Penguin, 1993. =Casting and characterization= Jan Clayton, a musical theater star and television quiz show panelist, was signed to a four-year contract to play Ellen Miller, the show's war widowed mother. George Cleveland was cast as her father-in-law, George Miller, and Tommy Rettig as her eleven-year-old son, Jeff. Rettig later remembered Clayton as a \\"second mother to me,\\" and dialogue coach Lloyd Nelson remarked, \\"I adored Jan Clayton. She was wonderful, a real neighbor, a real friend.\\" =Dogs= Ellen appeared with two dogs on the show: Pal, the star of the MGM films, and his son Lassie Junior thereafter. Pal appeared in only the two pilots. Lassie Junior was joined on the set by a stand-in rehearsal dog, a dog for long distance shots, and a \\"fight\\" dog for battles with other animals. =Cancellation= As the fourth season approached, discontent was brewing. Rettig was a fifteen-year-old teen who wanted to leave the show in order to enjoy the life of a normal teenager. Clayton had suffered the death of a teenage daughter in a car wreck and was considering leaving the show to return to her roots in musical theater. The show's owner and producer Jack Wrather was aware of the discontent and decided the series should strike a different course, with Rettig and Clayton eased out of the show in a three-part episode. A new storyline was developed that brought child actor Jon Provost to the show as Ellen's seven-year-old foster child Timmy. Lassie and Timmy were teamed together and the boy began playing a greater role in episode plots as filming progressed. Rettig and Clayton expected to be released, but producers were pleased with the status quo and made little effort to write either performer out of the show. Hoping Clayton would change her mind and remain with the show, they proposed a plot in which Ellen would wed and adopt Timmy. Clayton rejected the idea. A crisis was reached when series star George Cleveland died suddenly on July 17, 1957. Producers were forced to completely rework the series. An episode called \\"Transition\\" was quickly scripted with a simple but believable plot: Ellen and Jeff sell the farm to Paul and Ruth Martin, a young couple new to the area. The Martins adopt Timmy and Lassie. Ellen and her son leave the farm for life in the city where Ellen plans to teach music. Jeff was never referenced on the show again but Ellen made her final appearance in the episode immediately following \\"Transition\\". There, she returns to the farm at Ruth's invitation to advise her on raising a little boy. The Miller years of Lassie were almost immediately sold into worldwide syndication as Jeff's Collie. Awards In 1957, Clayton received an Emmy nomination for Best Continuing Performance by an Actress in a Dramatic Series for Lassie, and, in 1958, the actress received yet another Emmy nomination for Best Continuing Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic or Comedy Series for Lassie. Clayton also received a star on the Walk of Fame for Television at 6200 Hollywood Blvd. Lassie won its only Emmy Awards (Best Children's Program 1955, and Best Children's Series 1956), during Ellen's years on the show. The show also received a 1956 Peabody Award.

Each flower has six spreading tepals 1 to 1.5 centimeters long with a center containing three stamens and narrow or small staminodes, which are flat sterile stamens lying against the tepals. Conservation This plant occurs in grassland areas, often in floodplains, and it is a member of the local vernal pool flora.The Nature Conservancy It requires heavy clay soils. This type of habitat is becoming very rare as it is being cleared for development, especially as residential areas expand. Undeveloped land near residential areas is degraded by exotic vegetation, mowing and other fire suppression efforts, sewage dumping, grazing of livestock, off-road vehicle use, and other processes.USFWS. Five-year Review: B. filifolia. August 13, 2009. The plant is also at risk for reduced genetic variability. It often reproduces vegetatively by producing new corms, a method of cloning which does not produce individuals with new combinations of genes. When the plant does reproduce sexually, it requires unrelated individuals which have different genes; it cannot fertilize itself, nor can it successfully reproduce with closely related individuals. Small population sizes that have low genetic diversity and wide distances between populations make it less likely the plant will successfully undergo sexual reproduction. The plant sometimes hybridizes with Brodiaea orcuttii. There are about 68 occurrences remaining in widely spaced locations between the San Gabriel Mountains and west-central San Diego County. Several occurrences have been discovered since the plant joined the endangered species list, including locations on Camp Pendleton, and a few have been extirpated.

Quadricycles are defined by limitations in terms of weight, engine power and speed. There are two categories of quadricycles: light quadricycles (L6e) and heavy quadricycles (L7e). History The quadricycle classification was officially created in 1992, when the European Union published Directive 92/61/EEC which decreed that quadricycles fell into the same category as mopeds. In 2002, Framework Directive 2002/24/EC then refined this definition by distinguishing between light and heavy quadricycles (L6e and L7e categories). The framework for drivers licences of light quadricycles in the EU was released in 2006, with Directive 2006/126 (the third Driving Licence directive). This directive applies the same requirements for light quadricycles as for mopeds. This directive includes a recommendation to specify a minimum driving age of 16 years, although the age limit actually varies between 14 and 18 years between countries. CategoriesLight quadricycles (L6e)= circa 2005 Grecav EKE Light quadricycles (L6e) are defined by Framework Directive 2002/24/EC as: \\"motor vehicles with four wheels whose unladen mass is not more than 425 kg,REGULATION (EU) No 168/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL dated 15 January 2013 not including the mass of the batteries in case of electric vehicles, whose maximum design speed is not more than 45 km/h, and: # whose engine cylinder capacity does not exceed 50 cm3 for spark (positive) ignition engines, or # whose maximum net power output does not exceed 4 kW in the case of other (e.g. diesel fuelled) internal combustion engines, or # whose maximum continuous rated power does not exceed 4 kW in the case of an electric motor. These vehicles shall fulfill the technical requirements applicable to three-wheel mopeds of category L2e unless specified differently in any of the separate directives\\". =Heavy quadricycles (L7e)= 2012 Renault Twizy Quadricycles (L7e), also referred to as Heavy quadricycles, are defined by Framework Directive 2002/24/EC as motor vehicles with four wheels \\"other than those referred to (as light quadricycles), whose unladen mass is not more than 450 kg (category L7e) (600 kg for vehicles intended for carrying goods), not including the mass of batteries in the case of electric vehicles, with a design payload not more than 200 kg (passenger) or 1000 kg (goods), and whose maximum net engine power does not exceed 15 kW. These vehicles shall be considered to be motor tricycles and shall fulfil the technical requirements applicable to motor tricycles of category L5e unless specified differently in any of the separate Directives\\".  Country-specific legislation  Finland = The age limit for quadricycles is 15, while it is 18 years for cars in general. Mopeds have been traditionally popular in Finland among youth, and quadricycles have been introduced into the same niche. There is a licence category called AM-121, introduced in 2013, separately for quadricycles, although M-class (moped) licenses issued before 2013 qualify as well. Higher categories of licences (A1, A and B) automatically qualify for quadricycles, but age limits of A1, A and B are 16, 18 and 18, respectively. Some have been concerned about the danger that quadricycles slowness poses to other traffic.Turun sanomat 10.6.2006 Liikenneturvan aluep√§√§llikk√∂ Antero Aho pelk√§√§, ett√§ 45 kilometrin vauhdilla kulkevat mopoautot saattavat aiheuttaa vaaratilanteita tieliikenteess√§.

The quadricycle must be speed limited to and have a petrol/diesel motor up to or be electric powered up to . Paragraph 4 = United Kingdom = In the UK before October 2000, a person who passed a motorcycle test was automatically granted a full sub-category B1 licence, allowing them to drive a lightweight car (an unladen weight of or less), a motor quadricycle or a motor tricycle. Since 2000 a provisional car licence has to be obtained to legally drive such a vehicle.

Carnegie purchased the site in 1917 for $1.7 million shortly after a sign was erected reading \\"for sale without restrictions\\", his ownership prevented apartment house development there that would intrude on his mansion's surroundings, but the site remained undeveloped with only a few billboards and a lemonade stand on one of the city's most expensive addresses. Its subsequent sale to the church carried the restrictions that the land could only be used \\"for a Christian church no higher than 75 feet, exclusive of steeple\\" through 1975.Gray, Christopher. New York Streetscapes: Tales of Manhattan‚Äôs Significant Buildings and Landmarks. (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003), p. 280. The limestone church was designed in the neo-Gothic style by the firm Mayers, Murray & Phillip, successors to Bertram Goodhue. Goodhue died before the first stone was laid. Mayers Murray & Phillip took over construction. It opened Easter Day 1929, seating 1,050, at a cost of $3.2 million. Sculpture was to be executed by Malvina Hoffman, Lee Lawrie, and other artists. The architecture and sculpture combined Neo-Gothic styles with Art deco details. However, over two-thirds of the sculptural program was never executed; sculptor Janet Scudder withdrew from a commission in 1928 after it was downsized. The Stock Market Crash of 1929 ended other work and the blocky limestone facade was retained without sculpture.Gray, Christopher. New York Streetscapes: Tales of Manhattan‚Äôs Significant Buildings and Landmarks. (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003), p. 282. Innovative design features included unobstructed views of the altar, indirect lighting and a high-tech sound system. Music program The church has a number of choirs, including boys' and girls', a mixed adult choir, and a bell choir. For its patronal feast, which is All Saints' Day, the hymns \\"For All the Saints\\" and \\"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\\" are commonly sung. Notable people President Chester A. Arthur's funeral took place there. Gloria Swanson's ashes were interred there. In popular culture The church is featured in a scene in the 1997 film The Devil's Advocate starring Keanu Reeves. In the film, Kevin finds his wife Mary Ann sitting on a bench in the church, where Mary Ann reveals her naked body to be covered in cuts and bruises, accusing Milton (Satan) of raping her.The Devil's Advocate: On The Set of New York ReferencesExternal links * Category:Churches in Manhattan Category:Churches completed in 1929 Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York City Category:Episcopal church buildings in New York City Category:Religious organizations established in 1865 Category:Fifth Avenue Category:Upper East Side Category:1865 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Church of the Heavenly Rest"},{"id":"20744544","text":"Dunbar Glass Co. was a glassmaking company in Dunbar, West Virginia.

Accusations that the leaders of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era acted as \\"Red fascists\\" were commonly stated by anarchists, left communists, social democrats and other democratic socialists as well as liberals and among right-wing circles.  Overview  In the first half of the 20th century, a number of socialists in the United States began to hold the view that the Soviet government was becoming a red fascist state. One such leader, Norman Thomas (who ran for president numerous times under the Socialist Party of America banner), accused the Soviet Union in the 1940s of decaying into Red fascism by writing: \\"Such is the logic of totalitarianism\\", that \\"communism, whatever it was originally, is today Red fascism\\".Norman Thomas, \\"Which Way America‚ÄîFascism, Communism, Socialism or Democracy?\\", Town Meeting Bulletin, XIII, March 16, 1948, pp. 19‚Äì20.Les K. Adler and Thomas G. Paterson, \\"Red Fascism: The Merger of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in the American Image of Totalitarianism, 1930's‚Äì1950's\\", The American Historical Review, April 1, 1970, 75 (4): p. 1046, footnote 4. Bruno Rizzi, an Italian Marxist and a founder of the Communist Party of Italy, claimed as early as 1938 that \\"Stalinism [took on] a regressive course, generating a species of red fascism identical in its superstructural and choreographic features [with its Fascist model]\\".A. James Gregor, The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics, Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 193. Many leftists in the 1930s and 1940s became disillusioned by and estranged from the Soviet Union, condemning it for its rigid authoritarianism. Otto R√ºhle, a German left communist, wrote that \\"the struggle against fascism must begin with the struggle against bolshevism\\", noting the possible influence the Leninist state had on fascist states by serving as a model. In 1939, R√ºhle further professed: > Russia was the example for fascism. [...] Whether party 'communists' like it > or not, the fact remains that the state order and rule in Russia are > indistinguishable from those in Italy and Germany. Essentially they are > alike. One may speak of a red, black, or brown 'soviet state', as well as of > red, black or brown fascism.Otto R√ºhle, \\"The Struggle Against Fascism Begins > with the Struggle Against Bolshevism\\", the American Councillist journal > Living Marxism, 1939, Vol. 4, No. 8.Memos, C. (2012) \\"Anarchism and Council > Communism on the Russian Revolution.\\" Anarchist Studies, 20(2). Similarly, the exiled Russian anarchist Volin, who saw the Soviet state as totalitarian and as an \\"example of integral State capitalism\\", used the term \\"red fascism\\" to describe it. In a September 18, 1939 editorial, The New York Times reacted to the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact by declaring that \\"Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism\\".\\"Editorial: The Russian Betrayal\\", The New York Times, September 18, 1939. The editorial further opined: > The world will now understand that the only real 'ideological' issue is one > between democracy, liberty and peace on the one hand and despotism, terror > and war on the other. During the period while the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was in force, Benito Mussolini positively reviewed Stalinism as having transformed Soviet Bolshevism into a Slavic fascism.MacGregor Knox, Mussolini Unleashed, 1939-1941: Politics and Strategy in Italy's Last War, pp. 63‚Äì64. Despite ideological differences, Adolf Hitler admired Stalin and his politics and believed that Stalin was in effect transforming Soviet Bolshevism into a form of Nazism.Fran√ßois Furet, Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century, Chicago, Illinois; London, England, University of Chicago Press, 1999, pp. 191‚Äì192, . After being opponents for most of the 1930s, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 and remained aligned for the first two years of World War II, until Hitler broke it by invading the USSR in 1941.Roger Moorhouse, The Devil's Alliance, New York: Basic Books, 2014. French philosopher and journalist Bernard-Henri L√©vy has used the term in arguing that some European intellectuals have been infatuated with anti-Enlightenment theories and embraced a new absolutist ideology, one that is anti-liberal, anti-American, anti-imperialist, antisemitic and pro-Islamofascist.  Criticism  Since the 1930s, Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.Dave Renton, Fascism: Theory and Practice, London: Pluto Press, 1999. In addition, several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.Henry Rousso, Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared, Historische Zeitschrift, 286:3, 2008, pp. 795‚Äì796. Although Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick in Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared (2009) noted similarities between Stalinism and Nazism, they have also stated that \\"when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds\\".Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick, Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared, New York, New York, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 33‚Äì37 and 21. A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are \\"blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory.\\" British journalist and Labour Party aide Seumas Milne posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, \\"has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.\\"Seumas Milne: The battle for history.
