The National Society of Mural Painters (NSMP) is an American artists' organization originally known as The Mural Painters. The charter of the society is to advance the techniques and standards for the design and execution of mural art for the enrichment of architecture in the United States. Background The NSMP was founded in 1895, in an era of Beaux-Arts architecture in America, a time when public architecture was integrated with murals, sculpture, mosaics and other artwork, coordinated and themed to assert the identity of the building. Parallel organizations associated with the same principles of integrated public art include the National Sculpture Society, which originally included a large percentage of architectural sculptors, and the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, founded in 1916 as the teaching wing of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects. Still in existence after more than a hundred years, the society presents exhibitions and organizes competitions. The NSMP is a member of the Fine Arts Federation of New York.

He was elected to the Reichstag and held the position of the chief of the Munich Police during the Nazi era. Eberstein was a witness at the Nuremberg Trials.  Early life and career  Eberstein was born on 14 January 1894 in Halle on the Saale, of the Dillenburger branch of the von Eberstein family.Family News, 1958. The Dillenburger branch was started by Karl (1687‚Äì1725), grandson of Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein. See Familien Zeitung Nr10, 1900, foldout His father was an army major. Karl was at cadet schools until 1912. Early on in World War I, Karl served in the German Army with Field Artillery Regiment 17 in August 1914.Reichstag, Der Deutscher Reichstag, pg 136 He was also a balloon observer, and later a battery commander in Artillery Regiment 16. He was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and the Iron Cross First Class. After World War I, Eberstein fought as a member of the Freikorps in Middle Germany and/or Upper Silesia, and also with the Halle \\"Protection Police\\".Yerger, p 41 After that, he went into banking. Eberstein joined the (NSDAP) [Nazi Party] in 1922, but quit after the failed Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923. He then re- joined the Party in 1925 with number: 15067. He was an early member of the SS (membership number: 1386) and on the staff of Heinrich Himmler.Petropolous, p 260 According to Jonathan Petropolous, Eberstein was part of Himmler's strategy to attract members of the nobility and aristocracy to the SS. Eberstein obtained the officer rank SS-Sturmf√ºhrer on 1 April 1929. He also joined the SA in July 1930, but left it in February 1933. Eberstein eventually reached the high rank of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer,IMT, Trial of the Major War Criminals, Vol 20 Day 194 held two HSSPF posts, and was the F√ºhrer of SS- Oberabschnitt Mitte (and Elbe when Mitte was absorbed), and then later F√ºhrer of SS-Oberabschnitt S√ºd for over 10 years.Yerger, pp 31, 36, 86, 88, and 106  Heydrich and Himmler  Eberstein with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Joachim von Ribbentrop in 1938 Eberstein played a part in the first meeting of the two major leaders of both the SS and later the Holocaust: Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler. Eberstein and Heydrich's families were both from Halle on the Saale. His mother was Heydrich's godmother. He was also a friend of Lina Heydrich, Reinhard Heydrich's wife. Acting on the advice of Karl von Eberstein, Himmler agreed to interview Heydrich.Williams, Max. (2001) Reinhard Heydrich: Volume 1 - The Road To War, pp. 29, 30 When Himmler cancelled Heydrich's interview in Munich due to alleged illness, Lina ignored the message, and sent Heydrich on a Munich bound train. Karl met Heydrich at the station and drove him to meet Himmler. Himmler received Heydrich and hired him as the chief of the new SS 'Ic Service' or Intelligence Service, which would later become known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD).Williams, Max. (2001) Reinhard Heydrich: Volume 1 - The Road To War, p. 30  Role during Kristallnacht  Eberstein was the police president of Munich during Kristallnacht. On 10 November 1938, at 1:20 a.m., Heydrich sent out a telegram to various police organizations giving orders for police behavior during the riots. At 2:10 Eberstein sent a telegram to the State Police HQ of Augsburg, N√ºrnberg, W√ºrzburg, and Neustadt a.d. Weinstra√üe, the Regierungspr√§sident, and the Gauleiter, with the subject line \\"Anti-Jewish Measures\\". It relayed orders \\"from the Berlin HQ of the State Police\\", saying that \\"Anti-Jewish demonstrations\\" would occur, with synagogues and Jewish communal centers as targets, and that the demonstrations were not to be interfered with, except to prevent looting and excesses. The Ordnungspolizei or Orpo (uniform order police) would \\"...do nothing to hinder the demonstrations\\", but the criminal police and state police would wear plain-clothes. The SS troops could help, but the state police was supposed to maintain control. It went on to state that between 20 and 30,000 Jews would be arrested in Germany. It concluded: \\"...Every effort will be made to arrest immediately as many Jews as the jails will hold, primarily healthy male and well-to-do adults of not too advanced age\\".Eberstein, Telegram, Munich 47 768. A document from Beutel (probably Lothar Beutel), HQ of State Police Munich, six minutes later, stated that \\"officers of the state and criminal police\\" would accompany the demonstrators in plain-clothes, allow them to destroy Jewish shops and homes, but to prevent looting, after which the Orpo would secure the destroyed buildings.Beutel, Telegram, Munich 47 769. David Irving contends that Eberstein was a witness to Hitler's anger on that night, and that his testimony at Nuremberg helped prove that Hitler did not approve of Kristallnacht. This claim was refuted at the Irving v. Lipstadt trial, when Irving sued Lipstadt for calling him a Holocaust denier. Evans, in defense of Lipstadt, claimed that it made no sense for Eberstein to send his telegram of 2:10 a.m. if he had earlier that night listened to Hitler tirade angrily against the pogrom.Evans, David Irving, Hitler. . ., 4.3.c.ii.d. The judge at the trial agreed that Irving \\"seriously misrepresents the available contemporaneous evidence\\".Nizkor Project, Irving v Lipstadt Judgment, Part XIII.Gray, Irving v Lipstadt Judgment.  Stalag VII A Moosburg and the Gestapo  In late 1941, and early 1942, Eberstein was involved in a case involving Soviet Prisoners of War (POWs) at Stalag VII A, Moosburg, and the conflict between certain military officers and the SS over the murder of the POWs. The Gestapo was having problems with certain military officers, especially Major Meinel, who were not cooperating. Meinel was the army officer in charge of POWs for Munich and its surrounding areas. The Gestapo had been \\"screening\\" Soviet POWs in Stalag VII A Moosburg, and then shipping the \\"screened out\\" people to Dachau where they were murdered. Meinel discovered the murders were going on, and refused to follow orders to send several hundred of the remaining \\"screened out\\" Soviets to Dachau. He also complained to his superiors in the military about what was happening. \\"Screened out\\" people included anyone who was Jewish, any officers, believers in communism, incurably sick people, etc., but the Gestapo told Meinel their methods of screening were not his business.See the IMT, Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A. Also see the book by Otto, and the book by Steimer. Eberstein became involved. In the book \\"Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression\\", several telex / telegrams between the various offices involved have been translated and reproduced. These telegrams state that von Eberstein telephoned the RSHA or Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office)McNab, Chris (2009). The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, p 41. and told them that it was \\"intolerable\\" for Meinel to stay in his position, and it would cause problems with the relationship between the military and the SS. He told the RSHA to ask the military's German High Command (OKW) to have Meinel transferred to another position. After a few meetings, this is what concurred. The OKW decreed that the POWs that Meinel had temporarily saved would be surrendered to the Gestapo and then sent to Buchenwald. Meinel was later sent to Lithuania.  Authority over Dachau concentration camp  On 12 March 1938, Eberstein was appointed Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) for military district VII in Munich. In addition, on 17 December 1942 he was appointed HSSPF for the military district XIII in N√ºremberg. Dachau concentration camp fell under Eberstein's authority as HSSPF.  Dismissal from posts  Karl von Eberstein was dismissed from all posts on 20 April 1945 for \\"defeatism\\", by Gauleiter Paul Giesler, on orders from Martin Bormann.Yerger, pp. 41, 106. The charge of \\"defeatism\\" was made because he refused to support orders from the high command that prisoners held in camps within his administrative command be killed.  Nuremberg testimony  Eberstein was a witness at the Nuremberg Trials. He was interviewed by Horst Pelckmann, counsel for the SS, and Major F Elwyn Jones, junior counsel for the United Kingdom.IMT, Vol 1, . . . Defense CounselIMT, Vol 1, Prosecution Counsel In his testimony, Eberstein gave organizational and historical information about the SS, the SA, their relationship with the German nobility, the Nazi Party, the SD (Security Service) and the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Eberstein claimed that the SS was not in the view of his peers, a criminal organization, it was not created for purposes of violence, did not participate in the invasion of Austria, that he knew nothing of SS participation in the invasions of France, Belgium, Russia, Poland, etc. Also that \\"my men\\" in the Allgemeine-SS (general SS) did not mention atrocities when home from \\"front leave\\".IMT, Trial of the Major War Criminals, Vol 20 Day 195 As for his personal place in the chain of command, Eberstein stated that as a Police President, he had control over 1700 men in the Schutzpolizei (Protection Police), Ordnungspolizei (Order Police), and Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police). He claimed the \\"chiefs of police had nothing to do with the political police or the security service\\" (meaning the Gestapo, and the SD). It is unclear from this translation if he mentioned the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police) or SiPo. Eberstein also discussed his perspective on the Night of the Long Knives and Kristallnacht. In the latter, he claimed that he ordered his police to protect Jewish businesses, claiming, \\"We in the SS considered this action downright indecent\\", and blamed the events on a speech by Joseph Goebbels. However, given the telegrams Eberstein sent on that night, his claims cannot be seen as carrying any weight. He also briefly discussed the treatment of downed enemy pilots, per the Geneva Convention and Hague Rules on Land Warfare. = Denied involvement in Dachau concentration camp and the HSSPF = The Dachau concentration camp complex was only a few kilometers from Munich. The question arose in the trial as to Eberstein's knowledge of the camp, authority over it, and participation in its activities. Eberstein denied everything. He claimed that the Allgemeine-SS did not establish concentration camps, instead claiming that the State established them. Also, he claimed that the Higher SS and Police Leaders (HSSPF), and the leaders of the Allgemeine-SS had nothing to do with concentration camps. He claimed the camps were under an independent chain of command, blaming the RSHA, the Economic and Administrative Main Office of the SS (SS-WVHA), and its Amt D, Inspectorate of Concentration Camps. Eberstein claimed to have given tours of Dachau concentration camp, on orders from Himmler, from 1936 onward. These tours included some Americans. Eberstein stated there was no reason to inspect the camps, and he had no right to do so; they appeared to be run sufficiently and during the war inmates looked \\"well fed\\". In Spring of 1944, Eberstein claimed he became aware of abhorrent medical experiments involving Sigmund Rascher and had Rascher arrested; he complained to Himmler as to the matter. Eberstein stated that Rascher was kept under arrest until 1945, but that he had no power over Rascher. Eberstein stated that he had no authority over the camp commander, and didn't know about the numerous executions inside the camp. Eberstein claimed he had nothing to do with Adolf Eichmann and never saw him and that the SS troops in Dachau were separate from the rest of the SS and \\"we met them only occasionally\\". He did admit that some members of the Allgemeine-SS became concentration camp guards. > In the fall of 1944 Himmler transferred to the Higher SS and Police Leaders > the responsibility for safeguarding prisoner-of-war camps against mass > escapes and against attempts from the outside to liberate prisoners. For > this purpose, the Higher SS and Police Leaders were made senior commanders > of the prisoners of war in their defense areas. According to international > regulations regarding prisoners of war, police could not be used to guard > prisoners of war, so the Higher SS and Police Leaders were taken over into > the Waffen-SS and appointed generals of the Waffen-SS. - Eberstein's 1946 > Nuremberg explanation for how he came to be in the Waffen-SS and to have > some authority over POWs. Eberstein claimed he had a dispute with Gauleiter Paul Giesler, after Giesler ordered him to kill prisoners should the Americans approach, and he refused. He stated the general SS mostly ceased to exist by the start of the war, and that the Gauleiters; and \\"Reich Defense Commissioners\\", under Martin Bormann, were to blame. He claimed to have no knowledge as to the Einsatzgruppen, Einsatzkommandos, and the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. Eberstein stated he was in Munich during the entire war, thought foreign newspaper reports of atrocities were \\"enemy propaganda\\", and said it was impossible to \\"penetrate into the secret sphere of these extermination camps\\". He claimed the mass deaths in the camps on Typhus and allied bombing of medicine factories.  Denazification  The Denazification of Germany included the classification of ex-Nazis into one of 5 categories. On 15 November 1948, Eberstein was classified by a German Denazification court as a (class III) Nazi and ordered to forfeit 30% of his wealth. No additional jail time was ordered, because he was given credit for the three and half-years internment under the Allies. After some additional legal procedures, Eberstein was temporarily placed into a more serious category of former Nazi (class II). However, on 19 February 1953, he was finally classified in the less-serious category IV of Mitl√§ufer, which can be roughly translated as \\"follower and sympathizer\\". Other criminal investigations of Eberstein were without consequences, including preliminary investigations in 1950 and 1961 by prosecuting authorities in Munich of charges that Eberstein had ordered or participated in the murders of prisoners of war.From German Wikipedia article  Timeline  * 1913 to 1914.

The organization is a member of the Equality Federation. History Equality Utah was founded in 2001 as Unity Utah and took its present name in 2004. In 2008, Equality Utah's Common Ground Initiative brought the group national attention. During the campaigns for and against California's 2008 Proposition 8, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) made statements that the LDS Church \\"does not object to rights for same-sex couples regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights.\\" In response, on November 10, 2008, Equality Utah proposed a number of bills to the Utah State Legislature affording Utah citizens those rightsPress release (November 10, 2008). \\"Equality Utah Takes LDS Church at Its Word\\" . (PDF format,27 kB). Accessed December 19, 2009. and asked the LDS Church to \\"stand by\\" those statements. On December 23, 2008, Human Rights Campaign representatives delivered twenty-seven-thousand letters asking the LDS Church to support those bills; the LDS Church declined to comment on the matter. In 2015, Equality Utah supported Utah State Bill 296, which amended the state's Antidiscrimination and Fair Housing Acts to ensure further protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill also provided certain exemptions aimed at protecting religious freedom. SB 296 was passed in March 2015 by a wide margin of votes in the state house and senate. The bill's success was attributed in large part to the official endorsement of the LDS Church. Following the senate's vote on the bill, Equality Utah Executive Director Troy Williams praised the bill‚Äôs impact: \\"This is a stunning, historic day. I couldn't stop crying through it. This says that LGBT Utahns belong in this state. We belong here and we are being woven into the legal fabric of the state.‚Äù In October 2016, Equality Utah and the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed a lawsuit against the Utah State Board of Education and three local school districts to contest a law prohibiting ‚Äúadvocacy of homosexuality‚Äù in schools. (This law and similar laws in other states are often called ‚ÄúNo Promo Homo‚Äù laws.) The lawsuit was the first of its kind in the United States and was filed on behalf of three Utah students. The plaintiffs argued that the law limited free speech and created a hostile environment for LGBT students. The lawsuit was put on hold to allow the state legislature to consider a bill amending the ‚ÄúNo Promo Homo‚Äù law, and in 2017, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 196, which removed the language prohibiting advocacy of homosexuality. The passage of Senate Bill 196 made Utah the second state to repeal a No Promo Homo law (the first being California). Equality Utah celebrated the change, saying it sent ‚Äúa positive message that all students are valued in Utah.‚Äù  Advocacy Equality Utah is connected to two sister organizations: Equality Utah PAC (EUPAC) and Equality Utah Foundation. While Equality Utah focuses its efforts on legislation and lobbying, EUPAC dedicates its energy to endorsing and electing candidates who are supportive of the LGBTQ community. Equality Utah Foundation concentrates on educating people to participate in the political process. In 2016 and 2017, Equality Utah partnered with Wellstone Action, a grassroots progressive advocacy organization, to train potential political candidates for the campaign trail. As teen suicide has risen in the state of Utah, Equality Utah has focused its efforts on preventing such tragedies. In January 2018, Governor Gary Herbert announced the creation of the Teen Suicide Prevention Task Force. The coalition is made up of elected officials, suicide-prevention experts, and community leaders. Equality Utah is represented on the task force, which has been charged with finding solutions to reduce the number of teen suicides in Utah. Equality Utah hosts a number of signature events to fundraise and support the local LGBTQ community. Their regular events include: \\\\- Q Talks, a series of public speeches featuring short presentations on a variety of topics relevant to the LGBTQ community and its allies. \\\\- Allies Dinner, an evening gala and fundraiser featuring a yearly theme and high- profile keynote speaker.

Development The \\"Pegmantit 3\\" which is abbreviated to P-3 was one of the first 2D early warning and ground control radars to be developed by the former Soviet Union. The development of the radar was initiated in 1943 as a replacement for the previous RUS stations used during the second world war and by the end of 1947 the radar was completed and in operational service. The P-3 was the first radar to be developed by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V. I. Lenin, the predecessor of the current Nizhniy Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT). The radar had to be able to detect an aircraft to a range of no less than 130 kilometers, cover 360 degrees in azimuth and 4-18 degrees in elevation. A response time of no more than 25 seconds was stipulated and the radar had to be accurate to within 650 meters in range and within 700 meters in altitude, as well as operate in the VHF band. SKB managed to meet these performance requirements with the P-3 radar and this was confirmed during testing in 1945 before entry into service with the PVO. Description The P-3 was produced in two variants the P-3A (fixed) and the P-3M (mobile) with a transmitter and receiver mounted on separate trucks. Both variants operate in a similar fashion using two mast mounted antennas (transmitter and receiver) composed of Yagi antennas mounted one above the other in the case of the receiver, the radar also used an A-scope display. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the receiver antenna with elevation determined using a Goniometer, the phase difference between the upper and lower Yagi antenna was used to calculate the elevation angle which could then be used to determine the height of the target once the range was known. The P-3 had a maximum power output of up to 100 kW and a pulse duration of 10-15 microseconds. Operators The P-3 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1947 but has long since become obsolete and retired from service, replaced by more advanced models entering into service after the P-3 such as the P-8 radar.

The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season, Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands. It moved westward and passed about 55 km (35 mi) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2\\\\. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6\\\\. After brushing South Korea, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 8, before dissipating on September 12\\\\. The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left US$2.5 million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114 homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4 million in damage. About 250,000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¬•4.08 billion (US$36.9 million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322 mm (52.0 in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29 people and caused ¬•94.9 billion (US$854 million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35 people. Meteorological history On August 28, a large area of convection persisted about 1,035 km (645 mi) east of Guam. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north. At 00:00 UTC on August 29, a tropical depression formed from the system, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening, due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm. As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi. About 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm, after the convection organized into spiral rainbands. At 18:00 UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). On August 31, Nabi passed about 55 km (35 mi) north-northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach. The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph); this is the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. By contrast, the JMA estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2, with a barometric pressure of . While at peak intensity, the typhoon developed a large 95 km (60 mi) wide eye. For about 36 hours, Nabi maintained its peak winds, during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA; the Philippine-based agency gave it the local name \\"Jolina\\", although the storm remained away from the country. Typhoon Nabi on September 3, 2005, as seen from the International Space Station On September 3, Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north, the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge. Later that day, the winds leveled off at 155 km/h (100 mph), according to the JMA. On September 5, Nabi passed near Kitadait≈çjima and Yakushima, part of the Dait≈ç and ≈åsumi island groups offshore southern Japan. Around that time, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215 km/h (130 mph). After turning due north, Nabi made landfall near Isahaya, Nagasaki around 05:00 UTC on September 6, after passing through the Amakusa of Kumamoto. Shortly thereafter, the storm entered the Sea of Japan. The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow, influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula. At 18:00 UTC on September 6, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi, declaring it extratropical, although the JMA continued tracking the storm. On the next day, Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk. The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September 8, which continued eastward until the JMA ceased monitoring the storm's remnants on September 10, while situated south of the Aleutian Islands. The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September 12, dissipating soon afterward. Preparations Typhoon Nabi making landfall in Kyushu on September 6 After Nabi formed as a tropical depression on August 29, the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian, Rota, Sapian, and Agrihan. On August 30, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan, while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan. On all four islands, a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters. About 700 people evacuated on Saipan, and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000 travelers. As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August 31, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, Felix Perez Camacho, also declared a condition of readiness 2, as well as a state of emergency. Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam. Ahead of the storm, United States Forces Japan evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage. Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm's passage. While Nabi was turning to the north, the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2. At the military base in Sasebo, ships also evacuated, and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared. Flood warnings posted along the Shimanto River in advance of Nabi in Japan In Kyushu, officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan. These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483 households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000 residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports. The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800 people on Shikoku. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people. In addition, at least 723 flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries. About 700 schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500 soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm. Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area. In South Korea, the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at Pohang to close, and forcing 162 flights to be canceled. Ferry service was also disrupted, and thousands of boats returned to port. The storm also prompted 138 schools to close in the region. Earlier, the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003, both of which were devastating storms in South Korea. Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok, advising boats to remain at port. Impact While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of Anatahan, Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands. Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95 km/h (59 mph), with gusts to 120 km/h (75 mph). Also on the island, Nabi produced 173 mm (6.82 in) of rainfall. The storm destroyed two houses and left 26 others uninhabitable, while 77 homes sustained minor damage, largely from flooding or roof damage. Nabi damaged 70‚Äì80% of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees, leaving behind 544 tonnes (600 tons) of debris. The entire island was left without power, some without water, after the storm. On Tinian to the south, Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes, with heavy crop damage. On Rota, there was minor flooding and scattered power outages. Farther south, the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69 km/h (43 mph) at Apra Harbor on Guam, while gusts peaked at 101 km/h (63 mph) at Mangilao. Gusts reached 72 km/h (45 mph) at the international airport on Guam, the highest during 2005. The storm dropped 115 mm (4.53 in) of rainfall in 24 hours on the island. Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at Untalan Middle School, forcing hundreds of students to evacuate. Damage in the region was estimated US$2.5 million. After Nabi exited the region, it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan. Later in its duration, Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands. Ulsan recorded a 24‚Äëhour rainfall total of , while Pohang recorded a record 24‚Äëhour total of . The highest total was 622.5 mm (24.5 in) of rainfall. The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121 km/h (75 mph) in the port city of Busan, strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over. Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan, while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang. Throughout South Korea, the storm led to six fatalities and caused US$115.4 million in damages. In the Kuril Islands of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75 mm (3 in) of rain, equivalent to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83 km/h (51 mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo-Kurilsk. =Japan= The outer rainbands of Nabi began affecting Okinawa on September 3. The storm's strongest winds ended up bypassing the island, and wind gusts peaked at 85 km/h (53 mph). Two elderly women were injured from the wind gusts. There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged. In the Amami Islands between Okinawa and mainland Japan, Nabi produced gusts of 122 km/h (76 mph) in Kikaijima. Waves of in height affected Amami ≈åshima. Debris from Nabi littering Hiroshima's port While moving through western Japan, Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled over a three-day period in Miyazaki Prefecture, the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation. The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24‚Äëhour rainfall total of , as well as an hourly total of . Within the main islands of Japan, Nabi dropped 228.6 mm (9 in) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo. During the storm's passage, there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4,456 m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630 m3 (22,200 ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115 km/h (72 mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119 km/h (74 mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly. Throughout Japan, Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47 prefectures, leaving over 270,000 residences without power. Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country. The storm destroyed 7,452 houses and flooded 21,160 others. Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan, while others were closed due to power outages, such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. In addition, the storm wrecked about 81 ships along the coast. On the island of Kyushu, damage in ≈åita Prefecture on Kyushu reached ¬•11.7 billion (US$106 million), the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10 years; about 20% of the total there was related to road damages. In nearby Saga Prefecture, crop damage totaled about ¬•1.06 billion (US$9.6 million), mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables. Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled ¬•4.08 billion (US$36.9 million). In the capital city of Tokyo, heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers, which inundated several houses. Strong winds damaged ¬•28.8 million (US$259,000) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture, and ¬•27.1 million (US$244,000) in crop damage in Osaka. In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical Kintai Bridge, originally built in 1674. In Yamagata Prefecture, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris. One person was seriously injured in Kitakata, Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction. Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close. In Ashoro, an overflown river flooded a hotel, and a minor power outage occurred in Teshikaga. Ahead of the storm, high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the San'y≈ç Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people. In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29 people in Japan and injured 179 others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¬•94.9 billion (US$854 million). Aftermath After the storm, members of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni provided $2,500 to the town of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¬•58.8 billion (US$53 million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¬•12.6 billion (US$11.4 million). The total was split between ¬•49 billion (US$44 million) in housing claims and ¬•7.9 billion (US$71 million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent. On November 8, nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi, President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands. The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings, pay for debris removal, and other emergency services. Federal funding was also made available on a cost-sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters. The government ultimately provided $1,046,074.03 to the commonwealth. Due to the similar pronunciation to the word \\"prophets\\" in Arabic, and the conflict of religious views, the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization agreed to retire the name Nabi. The agency replaced it with the name Doksuri, effective January 1, 2007, and was first used during the 2012 Pacific typhoon season.

R. Rodic of Belgrade Archbishop Ivan Rafael Rodiƒá, O.F.M. (also , ; June 15, 1870 - May 10, 1954) was a Croatian Franciscan prelate, who served as the first Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Belgrade- Smederevo between 1924 and 1936. Biography Rodiƒá was born on June 15, 1870 in the village of Nurkovac, at the time in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. As a Franciscan, he graduated from the Vienna University of Theology and started teaching theology in Baja, Hungary in 1893, where he remained until 1898. He became the Abbot of the Franciscan monastery in Vienna, and the provincial minister of several monasteries in Croatia. Between 1881 and 1884, he was the provincial of the Province of St. John of Capistrano that included Slavonia, Syrmia and much of southern Hungary. In 1884, Rodiƒá in his capacity as provincial declined the request of Ivan Antunoviƒá to help start a newspaper for the Bunjevci Croats in Baƒçka, fearing opposition from higher authorities, but supported his cause - using their native language and relaying them news from Croatia. Antunoviƒá did nevertheless manage to start the newspaper, Neven, and eventually in 1909 Rodiƒá contributed several articles to it. He later served as the visitor general of the Order, travelling to numerous monasteries in Europe and America. On February 10, 1923 Rodiƒá became the apostolic administrator of the newly created Diocese of Banat and moved to Veliki Beƒçkerek (today Zrenjanin, Serbia). The following year, on October 29, 1924 he was named the archbishop of Belgrade-Smederevo. On November 28, 1936, he was replaced as an archbishop of Belgrade and instead became the titular archbishop of Philippopolis in Thracia. He died on May 10, 1954 in Po≈æega.

It was opened in 1875 by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (the Ostbahn) as part of the route between M√ºhldorf and Plattling, and was taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways on 1 January 1876. Whilst the southern section of the route from M√ºhldorf to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit became an important regional transport link as a result of the branches to Landshut and Passau at Neumarkt- Sankt Veit, the remaining section of the line never achieved its expected significance. Since 1970 only goods trains have worked between Neumarkt-Sankt Veit and Frontenhausen-Marklkofen, the adjoining section to Pilsting was closed entirely in 1969.  Course  Leaving the railway hub of M√ºhldorf, the railway to Pilsting initially runs northwards for about 2 kilometres through the plain between the Inn Canal and the river Isen, before entering the hill country, typical of the area, at Rohrbach (Oberbay). On the 16 kilometres or so of line from M√ºhldorf to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit there are no large towns en route, so that, apart from Rohrbach railway station, there is just one intermediate station (now closed) on the heights of the Taibrechting hamlet near Niederbergkirchen. Shortly before Neumarkt-Sankt Veit it crosses the river Rott and follows the valley for the next three kilometres. The town of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit has a centrally located railway station, from which the railways to Landshut and Passau branch off, giving the line its additional significance. Whilst the former leaves the route to Pilsting immediately northeast of the railway station at Neumarkt-Sankt Veit, the branch off point onto the Rottalbahn is about 2 kilometres further east. The route to Pilsting continues uphill towards the north, in order to cross the watershed between the Rott and the Bina in a cutting, after passing the former halt at Thambach, and finally runs down into the Bina valley. The market town of Gangkofen there has a railway station which is well west of the main settlement. North of Gangkofen the route climbs again in order to cross the line of hills between the Bina and the Vils. Near the highest point of the railway lies the little village of Obertrennbach, in which there is a small through station called Trennbach. Over the following eight kilometres the route falls again and reaches the Vils valley at Marklkofen via the valleys of the Trennbach and Schwimmbach. Here the trackbed follows the Vils for about 1.5 km in an east- west direction. In the village of Marklkofen is a railway station with the double-barrelled name of Frontenhausen-Marklkofen that forms the present-day northern terminus of the route, and is named after the neighbouring village of Markt Frontenhausen. West of the railway station the route crossed the Vils on three bridge sections until the closure of the section of the line from Frontenhausen-Marklkofen to Pilsting in 1969. Via the little villages of Poxau and Steinberg, where at one time there were wayside halts, the track runs finally uphill to the north. At the hamlet of Wunder the line crossed the watershed between the Vils and the Isar in a long cutting. Around here is also the intermediate station which lies about 1.5 km from the village of Griesbach, part of the town of Markt Reisbach. With steep inclines in places the route continues on to Mamming, where there is a railway station north of the Mamming brook which is crossed on a large bridge. The largest structure on the route is found on the next section where the river Isar is crossed on a steel truss bridge comprising five 36 m long section. Behind Goben the route finally reaches the railway station of Pilsting above two kilometres south of the market town which gives it its name. The following section from Pilsting‚ÄìPlattling is today part of the Landshut‚ÄìPlattling railway.  History  As part of a programme of construction authorised on the 3 August 1869 by the Bavarian state government, the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (known as the Bavarian Ostbahn) began work on a project that year for a railway link between M√ºhldorf and Plattling. Together with the Rosenheim‚ÄìM√ºhldorf railway, owned by the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.Sts.B), and the Bavarian Forest railway, also planned by the Ostbahn and which would form a junction north of Plattling, this was to provide a trans-regional link between the Inn valley and Bohemia. The licence for the construction eventually went to the Ostbahn on 25 November 1872, work beginning that same year. Under the direction of chief engineer, Ludwig Fromm, and architect, Karl Zenger, the 80.8 km long link from M√ºhldorf to Plattling was able to be completed in just under three years. The opening of the largely single-tracked main line, the trackbed of which was laid for two tracks along certain stretches in expectation of the likely rise in demand for rail services, took place on 15 October 1875. Between Pilsting and Landau, today part of the route from Landshut to Plattling, a second track was laid from the outset. On 1 January 1876 the route was incorporated, along with the entire Ostbahn company, into the K.Bay.Sts.B. In the following years several branches were built: the Landshut‚ÄìPilsting link, which opened on 15 May 1880, the Neumarkt-Sankt Veit‚ÄìLandshut railway, which went into service on 4 October 1883, and the Rottalbahn initially finished on 1. September 1879 as far as Pocking and finally extended all the way through to Passau by 6 October 1888. The expected trans-regional significance of the railway link never materialised; traffic between Tyrol and Bohemia was largely routed via Munich. The section from Pilsting to Plattling, however, gained significance as part of the (Munich‚Äì)Landshut‚ÄìPlattling(‚ÄìPassau) route and its operations were immediately aligned to it. The route between M√ºhldorf and Neumarkt-Sankt Veit soon proved to be of regional importance for both passenger and goods traffic, thanks to the branches to Landshut and Pocking/Passau. The Neumarkt-Sankt Veit‚ÄìPilsting section never had high numbers of passengers, however, due to the relatively sparse population, railway stations that were sometimes a long way from the villages and trade links that were oriented towards Landshut rather than following the railway route. With the rise of private motor car ownership from the 1950s the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) recorded an increasing reduction of the already low traffic volumes between Neumarkt-Sankt Veit and Pilsting. Various rationalisation measures were implemented, including the formal relegation of the Neumarkt-Sankt Veit‚ÄìPilsting section from a main line to a branch line in 1964. Nevertheless, the profitability of this section of the line continued to be inadequate. With the approval of the Federal Transport Ministry the DB closed local passenger services (SPNV) between Frontenhausen-Marklkofen and Pilsting as well as goods traffic between Frontenhausen-Marklkofen and Griesbach on 29 September 1969. With the cessation of goods transportation between Griesbach and Pilsting on 13 December 1969, the Frontenhausen- Marklkofen‚ÄìPilsting section was finally completely closed. The trackage there was dismantled in the years that followed. SPNV services did not continue for much longer between Neumarkt-Sankt Veit and Frontenhausen-Marklkofen; the last passenger train worked the line on 27 September 1970. By contrast, the factory of car suppliers, Mann+Hummel, based in Marklkofen, provided well-laden trains for many years, before the firm transferred its operations from road to rail in the 1990s for various reasons. The only regular user of the Neumarkt-Sankt Veit‚ÄìFrontenhausen-Marklkofen section since then is a joint regional refuse union that transfers household rubbish into containers in Marklkofen and dispatches it by rail to a refuse incineration plant at Burgkirchen. A sister firm of the company that runs the plant, Max Aicher, has also been the railway infrastructure company for the aforementioned section of the line since 2008. The southern section, M√ºhldorf‚ÄìNeumarkt-Sankt Veit, has been closely linked, operationally, with lines branching off in Newmarkt since the end of the 19th century and is used by trains working the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìLandshut and M√ºhldorf‚ÄìPassau routes. After the privatisation of the Deutsche Bundesbahn this section of the line was transferred to the S√ºdostBayernBahn division of the Deutsche Bahn. Since 28 September 2008 the points and signals on the line have been fully remotely controlled by the electronic signal box at M√ºhldorf.Bahn-Report 6/08, S. 71  Operations  Passenger services = In the early years of operations two pairs of trains ran daily between M√ºhldorf and Plattling, later this increased to four, and sometimes they ran on to Bayerisch Eisenstein. After the opening of the branches, traffic between M√ºhldorf and Neumarkt-Sankt Veit and between Pilsting and Plattling noticeably increased, whilst on the middle section the extension of some train services to and from Rosenheim was the only significant change. In 1924 there were three pairs of trains per day on the whole route, several years later again the usual four. To attract more passengers, an intermediate stop was built at Poxau in the post-war years and the timetable added a fast-stopping train (Eilzug) from Rosenheim to Plattling and back to the existing four pairs of trains shuttling between M√ºhldorf and Plattling. These services continued until the cessation of traffic between Frontenhausen-Marklkofen and Pilsting in 1969. Between M√ºhldorf and Neumarkt-Sankt Veit the route has also been worked by numerous trains on the routes to Landshut and Passau since the end of the 19th century. To these were added in the first half of the 20th century a moderate number of long-distance services, typically in the shape of a D-Zug (express) coach group from Berlin via M√ºhldorf to Klagenfurt. Under the direction of the Deutsche Bundesbahn between 15 and 20 passenger train pairs run daily on the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìNeumarkt-Sankt Veit section. In the 1990s these services were organised at standard intervals (to a so-called Taktfahrplan), whereby the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft tasked the operator, the S√ºdostBayernBahn, initially with two-hourly services on the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìPassau route and also between M√ºhldorf and Landshut, these being supplemented with extra services especially at peak journey times. Hourly services were introduced to Landshut from 14 December 2008, to Passau from 12 December 2009.Kursbuch 1944, Tabelle 427k, Sommer 1962 Tabelle 427h, Sommer 1982 Tabelle 943, Sommer 1987 Tabelle 943, 2008 Tabelle 945, u. a. = Goods traffic = After the anticipated use of the route for trans-regional goods traffic did not come to fruition, it was used mainly by local customers. From the north these mainly ran to Gangkofen, trains heading south departed from stations between the hub at M√ºhldorf to Frontenhausen-Marklkofen. Mixed trains were uncommon. Passenger and goods traffic was separated from the outset. Since about the 1960s the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìNeumarkt-Sankt Veit(‚ÄìLandshut) section trains have also increasingly come from the Bavarian Chemical Industry Triangle. Important local customers are the agricultural and forestry industries, the car suppliers, Mann+Hummel, at Marklkofen and, since the 1980s the regional refuse company. By 2008 after the loss of numerous freight customers, either of their own volition or as a result of the efforts of the former goods transport division of the Deutsche Bundesbahn and DB Cargo, the only goods traffic that remains are the chemical trains from the Chemical Industry Triangle, refuse transportation from Frontenhausen-Marklkofen and Eggenfelden (on the Rottalbahn) to the south and liquid transportation to Dietfurt (Rottalbahn). The train operation is Railion. = Running and rolling stock = For operations during the early years of the railway the relatively low-performance steam locomotives of the Ostbahn and the K.Bay.Sts.B. were sufficient. Amongst the classes employed were the tank engines of Class D XII, the all pervasive C III and the Bavarian B VI. Steam locomotives used by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the Bundesbahn included engines of classes 50, 54 and 57 in goods traffic and 24, 64, 70 and 86 for passenger services. railbuses of classes VT 95 and 98 took over much of the passenger traffic from the 1950s including the fast-stopping trains (Eilzug) on the Rosenheim‚ÄìPlattling route, whilst for goods duties the K√∂f III and V 100 ousted the steam locomotives. In the end the latter also took over the passenger trains hitherto hauled by steam engines. Variants of the V 160 also worked the route from the 1960s, mainly hauling goods trains from the chemical works \\"triangle\\". Since the early 1990s, passenger services from M√ºhldorf to Landshut and Passau have been mainly provided by Class 628 multiples, more rarely using Class 218 diesel locomotives. Regional goods traffic has been handled by Railion since 2006 using Class 294 locos. Representatives of classes 217 and 232/233 locomotives have been used for the chemical trains since the 1990s.

Background Origins of Sikhism= Sikhism began in the days of Guru Nanak (1469‚Äì1539) and grew to be a distinctive social force especially after the formation of the Order of Khalsa in 1699. Since the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Master, Guru Arjan in 1606, Sikhs have known the use of arms and the need of self-defense. The Khalsa was designated to oppose the tyranny of the Mughal Empire and any other form of injustice. Through much of the early eighteenth century, the Khalsa was outlawed by the government and survived in the safety of remote forests, deserts, and swamplands of the Punjab region and neighbouring Kashmir and Rajasthan.Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739‚Äì1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739‚Äì1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, p. 10; Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469‚Äì1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 121. =Persecution of the Sikhs (1739‚Äì46)= Zakariya Khan Bahadur, the Governor of Lahore, offered lucrative rewards for the discovery and killing of Sikhs. A substantial monetary reward was offered for information on the whereabouts of a Sikh. A blanket was offered to anyone who managed to cut off the distinctive mane of a Sikh or Khalsa and a larger sum for the delivery of a Sikh skull. The plunder of Sikh homes was made lawful and anyone giving shelter to or withholding information about the movements of the Sikhs was liable to themselves being executed. Zakaria Khan's police scoured the countryside and brought back hundreds of Sikhs in chains. They were publicly executed at the horse market of Lahore, since renamed \\"Shahidganj\\", \\"place of the martyred\\".Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739‚Äì1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739‚Äì1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, pp. 7‚Äì13; Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469‚Äì1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 127. Bhai Bota Singh During the days of persecution Bhai Bota Singh who lived in the forest would come out in search of food from sympathizers and occasionally would visit Amritsar by night and take a dip in the holy pool around Harimandir Sahib. One day he was noticed by some people who thought he was a Sikh but a member of their party objected saying he could not have been a Sikh, for had he been one, he would not have concealed himself so. Other versions of the story say that Mughal guards were passing the forest when one said that the Sikhs were all deceased and there were none left. Vexed by the observer's remark, Bhai Bota Singh set on a plan whereby he and his companion Bhai Garja Singh took up a position on the main highway near Tarn Taran. There, they proclaimed the sovereignty of Khalsa and collected a small toll tax from each passerby. They also sent a notice with a traveller for the governor to get his attention. After seven days 1000 soldiers with 100 horsemen came to apprehend the two Sikhs who then died fighting.J.S. Grewal, \\"The Sikhs of Punjab\\", The New Cambridge History of India, Cambridge, 1998, p. 90; Bhagat Singh, \\"Bota Singh\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume I, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1995, pp. 387‚Äì88. The Martydom of Mani Singh Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh being tortured by dismemberment Bhai Mani Singh was a significant Sikh scholar and teacher who lived in the city of Amritsar, founded by Guru Ram Das. For many years, Sikhs had customarily gathered at Amritsar in the spring and fall for the holidays of Vaisakhi and Diwali. Under the persecution of the Mughals, these festivals had been disrupted. Bhai Mani Singh sought and obtained Zakaria Khan's permission to hold the Diwali celebration in Amritsar on payment of a tax of 5000 rupees. When Mani Singh found out that the governor had dispatched a large number of soldiers to annihilate the Sikhs gathered at Amritsar, he sent word out to the Sikhs in their forest and desert hideouts, forbidding them from coming. In consequence, no money was collected and Bhai Mani Singh was prosecuted for not paying the stipulated sum. After a summary trial, he was given the choice of embracing Islam or facing death. Bhai Mani Singh chose the latter and as his punishment was to cut him to pieces, joint by joint.Major Gurmukh Singh, \\"Bhai Mani Singh\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume III, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1997, pp.39‚Äì41., =The Golden Temple and Massa Ranghar= To prevent the Sikhs accessing the holy shrine Harmandir Sahib, or the \\"Golden Temple\\", at Amritsar a Mughal military officer named Massa Ranghar was stationed there. Massa Ranghar was physically strong, fit and tall. Ranghar not only occupied the holy place, but committed sacrilege by carousing with dancing girls and consuming meat and alcohol in the Sanctum Sanctorum situated in the midst of the sacred pool. This offence continued until news of it reached an isolated band of Sikhs in Rajasthan. Of them, Mehtab Singh and Sukkha Singh set off to cross the distance to Amritsar. Finding the city strongly guarded, the two disguised themselves as revenue officials. In this guise, they entered the Harmandir Sahib, cut off Ranghar's head and escaped before the Mughal soldiers could realise what had happened. This took place on 11 August 1740.Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer: Sikh History in 10 Volumes (2009‚Äì2012)Gurdev Singh Deol, \`Masse Khan Ranghar\`, The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume III, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1997, pp. 63‚Äì64; Gurdev Singh Deol, 'Matab Singh', The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume III, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1997, pp. 65‚Äì66.

The Martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh depicted martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh ji Zakaria Khan, the governor of Lahore, experienced great frustration in his effort to decimate the Sikhs. He once asked his men, \\"From where do the Sikhs obtain their nourishment? I have debarred them from all occupations. They realize no taxes, they do not farm, nor are they allowed to do business or join public employment. I have stopped all offerings to their Gurdwaras. No provisions or supplies are accessible to them. Why do they not die of sheer starvation?\\"Bhagat Singh, \\"Bhai Taru Singh\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1998, p. 325. An informant directed the governor to the village of Puhla where lived a 25-year-old Sikh named Taru Singh who according to the informant they would supply food and resources to the Khalsa who were in the forest. Taru Singh's mother and sister both toil and grind grain to make a living, together they earned little but sent what they got. On hearing this the governor sent a detachment of soldiers to Bhai Taru Singh's village to arrest him and bring him to the provincial capital of Lahore. The year was 1745. When the Sikh heard of their approach, he came out of the village wishing to spare his village any sort of hardship and surrendered to the governor's men. When he refused to convert, his distinctive long hair was scraped from his scalp and the young Sikh left to die. Afterwards Taru Singh was given over to a Sikh family who tended to him for his remaining days.Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739‚Äì1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739‚Äì1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, p. 11; Bhagat Singh, \\"Bhai Taru Singh\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1998, pp. 325‚Äì26; J.S.

The Massacre of 1746 It was in this atmosphere of persecution that the Chh≈ç·π≠ƒÅ Ghall≈´ghƒÅrƒÅ took place in 1746. Early in that year, Jaspat Rai, a military commander was killed in an encounter with a roving band of Sikhs. Jaspat's brother, Lakhpat Rai, who was a revenue minister at Lahore, vowed his revenge. With the help of the new governor, Yahiya Khan, Lakhpat Rai mobilised the Lahore troops, summoned reinforcements, alerted the dependent rulers of the kingdoms in the Himalayan foothills, and roused the population for a genocide of the \\"infidel\\" Sikhs. The Sikh inhabitants of Lahore were first rounded up, then executed on 10 March 1746. Lakhpat Rai next set out for the swampy forest of Kaahnoovaan, near the town of Gurdaspur, about to the north-east of Lahore, where Sikhs were reported to have concentrated. Lakhpat had with him with a large force of mostly cavalry, supported by cannon, with which he surrounded the forest and began a systematic search for the Sikhs. The Sikhs held out for some time and struck back whenever they could. Heavily outnumbered and under-equipped, they decided to escape to the foothills of the Himalayas to the north. The Sikhs crossed the River Ravi and came in sight of the foothills, a trek with the enemy in pursuit, only to find the armies of the hill rajas arrayed to oppose them. Caught between these two armies and running out of food, the Sikhs suffered heavy casualties. At last, they managed to break through the encirclement and to recross the River Ravi in a desperate attempt to reach the safety of the Lakhi Jungle, near Bathinda, some to the south. In the river crossing, many of the weakened Sikhs were swept away by the current. With Lakhpat Rai's forces still in hot pursuit, they crossed two more rivers, the Beas River and Sutlej, before finally arriving at the sanctuary of the Lakhi Jungle. An estimated 7,000 Sikhs were killed and 3,000 captured during this operation. The captives were marched back to Lahore, paraded in the streets and publicly beheaded. Given the small numbers of the Sikhs in those days of persecution, the losses will have been a very substantial proportion of their population. Lakhpat Rai went on to order Sikh places of worship destroyed and their scriptures burnt. He went so far as to decree that anyone uttering the word \\"Guru\\" be put to death and even saying the Punjabi language word for sugar, \\"gur\\", which sounded like \\"Guru\\", could be cause for the death penalty.B.S.

KIQZ was simulcasted on sister station KRAL also from Rawlins. KIQZ is currently broadcasting under special temporary authority. History The station was assigned the call letters KIAJ on August 13, 1981. On November 4, 1981, the station changed its call sign to the current KIQZ. In the late 2000s, the station fell silent citing financial and staffing difficulties. The station filed for resumption of operations twice, once in 2011, and a year later in 2012. Days after the resumption of operations, the stations fell silent again, similar to the situation on AM sister station KRAL.CDBS Correspondence Folder (FCC) The station had until June 22, 2013 to resume operations, otherwise its license would be cancelled and penalties would be issued from the FCC.KIQZ request to remain silent The station and its sister again requested a special temporary authority (STA) to go silent in early 2013 as a result of employees \\"unexpectedly\\" resigning and the difficulty finding new employees at the remote location.http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/138846/arizona-noncommercial-fm-permit-sold-for-700-000 The station and its sister station KRAL AM returned to air status in January 2016 broadcasting a mix of the 90s/2000s/now format programmed by station staff. The stations are currently under new management, but not new ownership, and broadcasting an active rock format under FCC STA authority while transmission facilities are being reconstructed. Signal KIQZ covered most of central Carbon County, much like its sister station KRAL. It could only be heard to the Sweetwater County/Carbon County line. The station went silent in the late 2000s, citing technical limitations, however that may not have been the only reason (see next paragraph). It is currently operating at less power from a temporary location near the studio. FCC Fines and Penalties Since the station's change of ownership from \\"Elk Mountain Broadcasting\\" to current owner \\"Mount Rushmore Broadcasting\\", KIQZ, and its sister station, KRAL (AM 1240) have been fined by the FCC many times. Past penalties include a $20,000 fine for \\"failing to maintain the operational readiness of the EAS (Emergency Alert System) equipment (see FCC Rules/11.35(a)), as well as other equipment issues and violations and failure to maintain a complete public records file.\\"*Daily Briefing Federal Communications Commission December 10, 2008 Sources connected to the FCC say that more and significantly higher fines/penalties are probable. They continue by stating that any station owned or operated by Mt. Rushmore Broadcasting will \\"not likely\\" have their licenses renewed once they expire, due to the history of \\"past violations and cavalier attitude(s) towards following and maintaining\\" rules and regulations, and that this and other M.R.B. stations could have their broadcasting rights taken away \\"at almost any moment\\". Since this is an all-but-done set of circumstances, Mt. Rushmore Broadcasting's owner, Jan Charles Gray has been operating all of M.R.B.'s stations with little or no staff, whatsoever. On or around July 10, 2010, Gray filed with the FCC documentation that stated KRAL had gone off the air due to \\"technical\\" problems. What he failed to do was inform the FCC that the station had been in a non-broadcasting mode for well over 18 months prior to this filing. Several past and current employees of M.R.B. had informed Gray of the station's failing broadcast signal as far back as 2008, with Gray responding \\"No one listens to A.M. radio anymore, anyway.\\" Dating to 1998, managers were terminated for failure to maintain EAS equipment, as well as failing to notify the station owner of the problems in hopes it would appease the FCC. The FM transmitter was not operational from 2003 to 2006. At that time, a replacement transmitter was brought in however with a history of non- payment, broadcast contractors were not willing to install it without payment in advance. This payment never materialized and KIQZ stayed running on exciter power only until 2013*. Power was cut at the studio and transmitter site due to non payment. The Bureau of Land Management then reverted control of the land the FM tower site sat on to another owner. The land under the transmitter site for KRAL received a legal filing. This bared any Mount Rushmore Broadcasting employee from accessing the tower. In January 2016, work to restore the facilities to normal operations resumed, however both KIQZ and its AM sister have yet to find suitable locations for permanent facilities. KIQZ is broadcasting from a sign post outside the studios. KRAL is broadcasting from a wire antenna near the studios as well at significantly lower power than licensed. *An exciter is the piece of equipment at the signal tower that provides low power output to the transmitter itself and determines what frequency is being broadcast.

These islands have a total of 320 kilometers of shoreline. A National Scenic Area is not a National Park. National Scenic Areas fall within the control of the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China, while national parks fall within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of China. The philosophies that govern the development of the two types of areas differ. For a national park the emphasis is on the preservation of natural and cultural resources, and development for human utilization is definitely a secondary priority. For a national scenic area, the priorities are more balanced between preservation and tourism utilization. This has led to conflicts between preservationists and those more favorable to the development of the area. The National Park Law of the Republic of China only applies to the latter areas. Studies about the project were first debated since the beginning of 1990 and, after a year of evaluations carried out by the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China, it was officially created in February 1991, when the Penghu office was finally established. The aim of the project was to \\"efficiently utilize the local resources and help Penghu's economic growth\\", while building vacation spots on the coast of Taiwan's only island county to attract both Taiwanese nationals and foreigners, making of Penghu an \\"International tourism vacation center\\". It is a well known scenic area for its sandy beaches. The tourist season in Penghu starts in April and peaks from June through August. The Scenic Area attracts thousands of weekenders with its brisk sea breezes and scenery. But when the autumn gales begin to blow in October, the archipelago becomes deserted until April, when warmer weather seems to thaw the local tourism industry. In addition to its rich oceanic resources, Penghu offers fantastic sights of basalt column formations. The scenic area lures more than 200 species of migratory birds, making it an important spot for Asia's birdwatchers. It was not always like this: for much of the second half of the past century, the Government of the Republic of China saw the islands in mainly political and military terms, as a naval base: \\"Penghu was regarded as a military base until the early 1990s. As a result, the central government never wanted to develop the islands, which resulted in Penghu's shortages of water and electricity and, of course, a lot of five-star hotels\\". The National Scenic Area comprises most, but not all, of Penghu County, and its divided into three recreation areas: * North Sea recreation area, * Magong recreation area, and * South Sea recreation area. North Sea recreation area (ÂåóÊµ∑ÈÅäÊÜ©Á≥ªÁµ±) Tropical fishes and lots of coral reefs. The place is home to green sea turtles and whales. Among the tourism routes in Penghu, the natural landscape and ecology of the North Sea islets, fishing villages and water activities are the most popular among tourists. The entire Jibei islet of Penghu North Sea is 3.1 square kilometres in area, and it has a coastline of 10 km; being the largest island on the North Sea recreation area. The Sand Beach Beak, southwest of Jibei islet houses a white sand beach extending 1500m, mainly composed of corals and shell fragments that were shipped to shore by the sea. The North Sea Recreation Area is a perfect site for all kinds of water activities. Xianjiao islet; situated south of Jibei islet, won its name due to the vast amount of submerged reefs around the island (Xianjiao means dangerous reefs), and houses rich resources under the sea; the sand beach and its shallow coral ground is the best place for snorkeling and water activities. Tiejhan islet is a classic basaltic hill terrain, and many seabirds come here during the summer to dwell and breed, making this place a spot for bird- watching. The nearby Gupo islet has an abrasion plateau which will be covered in the best quality wild laver at the end of winter, which is the ideal season for laver harvest. Mudou islet situated at the north end houses the Mudou islet Lighthouse. =Jibei Island= Jibei Island Jibei Island is commonly used for water activities, and the island houses various types of recreational activities, including banana boat, dragged buoy, two-man speedboat, water motorcycle, under-the-sea sightseeing boat, paragliding and snorkeling. Another tourism feature of Jibei is the number of \\"stone weirs\\" housed here; there are over 80 stone weirs, more than any other places in Penghu, thus winning the name \\"Home of the Stone Weirs\\" =Mudou islet= Mudou Islet () is situated at the north end of the Penghu islands, only 7 km away from Jibei islet to the south; the island is 454 metres in perimeter and only 0.021 square kilometres in area, it is a tiny islet, famous for its Mudou Lighthouse. The waters between Mudou islet and Jibei islet consist of a deep water abrasion platform, and submerged reefs can be found everywhere in the area, hence, the numerous accounts of shipwrecks. It is said that ancestors who lived on Jibei used to pick up floating stuff from the wrecked ships. But for precisely the same reason, animals and plants under the sea can all enjoy sufficient sunlight, and people above water can also see right to the bottom of the ocean. To ensure the safety of the boats while travelling the dangerous area, the lighthouse was built on Mudou in 1921, when Taiwan was a Japanese colony. An iron-framed lighthouse of 40 metres high, painted in black and white stripes, standing as the tallest lighthouse in East Asia. The lighthouse is equipped with its own generators. The basalt that formed Mudou islet still maintains its primitive landscape, with black rocks tightly surrounding the island. There is a shallow sand belt between Mudou and Jibei, extending hundreds of meters long and 5m wide, where the water only comes up to the knees. Seashells can also be found. Another special landscape of Mudou islet is the underwater tunnel. It is at the bottom of a steep cliff, hidden by the sea during flood tide, but when the tide ebbs, people can walk in sideways. The tunnel is about 80m long, it is a special basalt fissure. =Gupo Island= Gupo Island Gupo Island is situated northwest of Baisha and southwest of Jibei Island. It is a mesa plateau composed by basalt; extending 1 metre from north to south, being the largest unmanned island among the Penghu archipelago. The islet has a lot of vesicular basalt, but the surface is covered with ferrugieous quartz sandstone. The islet houses a British Shipwreck Monument, on its east side is the silver anchovy fish ground, and the southeast side houses corals. The north side is the famous laver ground, Penghu island has a lot of reefs and is extremely windy with big waves during the winter, and this place is known far and wide for its abundant harvest of laver; towards the end of every lunar year, there will be a large harvest event, when firecrackers will be lit, and everybody will bring out their best skills to harvest laver. The origin of the name Gupo has aroused the curiosity from many. There is a legend that says that a long time ago, there lived a young lady, who had a boyfriend whom she had loved for years; however, her parents were against this relationship and forced her to marry someone else. The girl decided to run away from home to fight against her parents' decision to marry her to someone else, and also to prove that her love with her boyfriend was strong. She came to the unmanned island and lived out her days all alone. When her younger family members visited her, they would call her \\"Gupo\\" (ÂßëÂ©Ü, great aunt) out of respect. =Xianjiao islet= Xianjiao Islet () is located south of Jibei islet, Baisha Township in Penghu County, and north of Chihkan. This place won its name because it is surrounded by submerged reefs (Èö™Á§Å, xianjiao), but the surrounding underwater natural resources are rich, making this a great spot for snorkeling. In addition to the abrasion platform formed by a small rock on the east half of Xianjiao islet, most of the island is a white sand beach composed of sand grains, shell and coral fragments. The name warns passing-by boats to beware of the waters here. =Yuanbei Island= Yuanbei Island Yuanbei Island is situated east of the Citou Village on Baisha islet. The entire Yuanbei islet is a hill, and it was named so because it is shaped like a seashell covering the water (Âì°Ë≤ù means \\"circular shell\\"). The basalt columnar joints of the north coast on Yuanbei are well developed, among which, the stone pen and stone ink holder is most renowned; the east coast of Yuanbei islet has a piece of flat columnar basalt, with its surfaces full of wrinkles just like a pleated skirt; this is a place visitors know for its \\"one pen, one ink holder, one skirt\\" view, currently listed as the Basalt Reservation Area. Yuanbei islet shallow water path When the tide ebbs, there will be a shallow water path extending from Cao islet to the Guardian Stone; the 4.6 km shallow water path can take you to Shagang Village on the other side. The Yuanbei islet shallow water path is composed of stone plates, stone fragments and coral reefs, it is a sea path which Yuanbei ancestors used to rely on for outside contact, bearing significant historical meaning, adding to the fact that there is a rich shallow sea ecology here, the Yuanbeiyu shallow water path has become a popular route in recent years. Magong Island Recreation Area Magong Island Recreation Area () includes Magong Island (È¶¨ÂÖ¨Êú¨Â≥∂, the main island), Pengnan area (ÊæéÂçóÂú∞ÂçÄ), Xiyu Township (Ë•øÂ∂ºÈÑâ), Baisha Township (ÁôΩÊ≤ôÈÑâ) and Huxi Township (ÊπñË•øÈÑâ). During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Magong City (È¶¨ÂÖ¨Â∏Ç) was an important commercial and trade center across the Taiwan Strait, which gradually evolved into an important administration area for Penghu today. After hundreds of years, many historic heritages were left behind (Dutch, Portuguese and French). Magong City reflects in its architecture the historical evolution of the county. Xiyu Township is situated west of the Magong Island. The island is filled with well-known tourist sites, including the natural bay of Zhuwan (Á´πÁÅ£), and the Dachi (Â§ßÊ±†) sand beach on the southwest side, which is the most famous beach in the national scenic area and the county. The \\"Yuweng Lighthouse\\" (ÊºÅÁøÅÁáàÂ°î), standing on the southeast end of the island, is the oldest lighthouse in the whole of Taiwan. Baisha Township is a famous spot for bird- watching. The nearby Chikan (Ëµ§Â¥Å) underground reservoir is the one and only underground reservoir in Taiwan. The northeast coast of Huxi Township is geologically complicated, and a long period of erosion has led to a multi- variant geological environment, such as Beiliao Peninsula (ÂåóÂØÆÂçäÂ≥∂) and Qingluo Peninsula (ÈùíËû∫ÂçäÂ≥∂). =Beiliao Recreation Area (ÂåóÂØÆÈÅäÊÜ©ÂçÄ)= \\"Starry Kuibi\\"(Â•éÂ£ÅËÅØËºù) of Beiliao Kuibi (ÂåóÂØÆÂ•éÂ£Å) is one of the eight most renowned views in the Magong area of the National Scenic Area, and wave-chasing in Kuibishan (Â•éÂ£ÅÂ±±), located in Beiliao, has become an important tourism resource in Penghu. The original name was very similar to its present one: the place was firstly named Guibishan (ÈæúÂ£ÅÂ±±), which translated means \\"turtle wall mountain\\", because when looking at Beiliao coast from a distance, the area's shape resembles a sea turtle bending over on the sea. However, this suggestive name was later changed to its present one, which sounds pretty similar: Kuibishan (Â•éÂ£ÅÂ±±), which is a homonymic sound. In the past, on a full-moon night, when there were still many fishing boats out on the sea towards the east, you would feel as if you were part of the starry sky; thus such view was named \\"Starry Kuibi\\". =Guoye Sunrise Observatory (ËèìËëâËßÄÊó•Ê®ì)= Located to the south of the previous location, the observatory =Nei'an Recreation Area= Nei'an Recreation Area () houses an enormous beach, well known for its clear waters and white sand. The flat terrain provided residents of Nei'an Village (ÂÖßÂûµÊùë) and Wai'an Village (Â§ñÂÆâÊùë) a place to play with water and engage in intertidal zone activities. At the back of the beach is a narrow wooden path built according to the terrain, from there, you can look at Houziwei Cape (È±ü‰ªîÂ∞æÂ≤¨) in Chixi (Ê±†Ë•ø) from a distance. Neian North Sea Fishing Port has been selected by the Penghu County Government to build the first Waterpark in Taiwan. =Xiaomen Geology Gallery= Penghu is primarily composed of solidified lava from successive volcano eruptions, that endured and suffered the erosion of wind, rain and wave erosion during centuries, before becoming the present geological landscape. The place is known for its shaped rocks. Xiaomen Geology Gallery is situated at the entrance of the Xiaomen Recreational Area. The exhibition hall houses an information post. Xiaomen islet (Â∞èÈñÄÂ∂º) Xiaomen islet (Xiaomen Yu) is situated in Xiaomen Village (Â∞èÈñÄÊùë) in Xiyu Township, north of Xi islet (Ë•øÂ∂º), being 0.5121 square kilometers in area. It has long been known as the \\"Pearl of Houmen\\". Xiaomen Bridge connects Xiaomen islet with Xi islet Township, where there is a Scenic Center and a car park, as well as a path around the island, making this a famous scenic site. The name has its own history: East of Xiaomen Village lies a path with mountains on both sides. In the past, this path was the only access to the outside for villagers in the village, and the path looked like a small door (the literal meaning of Xiaomen) from a distance, hence the name. =Tongliang Great Banyan (ÈÄöÊ®ëÂè§Ê¶ï)= In front of the Baoan Temple (‰øùÂÆâÂÆÆ) in Tongliang Village (ÈÄöÊ®ëÊùë), there is an old banyan (Ficus benghalensis) dated over 300 years, which is the oldest and largest tree in Penghu, (it occupies a total of 95 cubic feet), which provides shadow for people. If visitors do not look closely, they can hardly tell that they are all from the same trunk. There is a legend about this tree: it says that during 1662‚Äì1722, a merchant vessel passed the waters around Tongliang when it encountered a shipwreck, and the only thing that survived was a sapling floating on the sea. Residents of Tongliang picked it up and planted it in front of the temple; judging by this legend, the Tongliang Great Banyan could possibly be over 300 years old. However, there is still another legend saying that the Tongliang Great Banyan is probably only a hundred years old: according to Chinese planting customs, trees are usually planted after a temple is built, so, judging by the history of Baoan Temple, which was established just over a hundred years ago, and not three centuries, the Tongliang Great Banyan could be not that old. =Zhongtun Wind Power Area (‰∏≠Â±ØÈ¢®ÂäõÂçÄ)= The wind farm sits in Zhongtun Village (‰∏≠Â±ØÊùë) of Baisha Township, and it was the second wind farm to be built in the Republic of China. It has been in operation since August 2001. Such a construction would be unthinkable if Penghu were a National park. =Caiyuan Leisure Fishery Farm (ËèúÂúí‰ºëÈñíÊºÅÊ•≠ÂçÄ)= During the Qing Dynasty, the terrain here was relatively lower than today with abundant water resources and rich fertile soils. Green vegetables were growth in large patches, so the place was named Caiyuan, which literally translates as vegetable garden. Caiyuan is situated southeast of Magong, close to the inner bay northeast of the inland sea; the rich oceanic resources housed here enables a diversified ecology park, including wetland ecology and shallow coral grounds. Like all fishing ports, Caiyuan Fishing Port also has fresh fishes from the sea, and oyster and near-sea net cage activities can also be seen. There is a \\"Caiyuan Life Memorial Park\\" nearby. =Shili Beach (ËíîË£°Ê≤ôÁÅò)= The beach is situated on Fenggui Peninsula (È¢®Ê´ÉÂçäÂ≥∂), down the south end of Magong City. This spot, located on the southwestern side, extends over 1 kilometer and it's also a well known sandy beach. Water activities and snorkeling can be practiced here. There is an earth mound just north of Shili Village (ËíîË£°Êùë), shaped like a shamao (Á¥óÂ∏Ω), the hat officials wore in the pre- republican era. Following this similarity, the mound was called Shamao Hill (Á¥óÂ∏ΩÂ±±). Shili just happens to be inside the extended part of the \\"shamao\\" (pronounced as \\"shi\\" in Taiwanese). Hence the village was named \\"Shinei\\" (ËíîÂÖß) or \\"Shili\\" (ËíîË£°). Both \\"nei\\" and \\"li\\" means \\"inside\\"). =Shanshui Beach (Â±±Ê∞¥Ê≤ôÁÅò)= Shanshui used to be called \\"sow in water\\" (Ë±¨ÊØçËêΩÊ∞¥). A legend says that there was once a sow on the beach who got dragged into the sea by a giant octopus, so the place was named sow in water. During the Japanese colonization of Taiwan and Penghu, the place was renamed to \\"sow water\\" (Ë±¨ÊØçÊ∞¥), and then \\"Shanshui\\" (Â±±Ê∞¥) after the retrocession of both Taiwan and Penghu to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945 at the end of the Second World War. The area comprised between Guanyin Mountain (ËßÄÈü≥Â±±), near the Shanshui fishing port east of Shanshui south-bank, and Zhumushuishan (Ë±¨ÊØçÊ∞¥Â±±) on the west side, is called Zhumushuian (Ë±¨ÊØçÊ∞¥Âûµ). =Fenggui Cave= To listen to the waves at Fenggui Cave is a well-known activity in Penghu. Fenggui Village (È¢®Ê´ÉÈáå) is situated at the very end of Fenggui Peninsula (È¢®Ê´ÉÂçäÂ≥∂), so this place used to be called \\"End of Fenggui\\" (È¢®Ê´ÉÂ∞æ). The south coast of the village has well- developed basalt columns, and there is an abrasion ditch eroded by the waves and a sea hole at the bottom of the abrasion ditch due to erosion. From the sea hole, there is an opening that goes up to the ground following the joint fissure, so that every time the tide rises, the waves will pour into the abrasion ditch, push the air inside the sea hole, and gush out the opening along the joint fissure carrying some sea water, making a howling sound, just like the noise made by a wind pumper. = Lintou Park and Aimen Beach (ÊûóÊäïÂÖ¨Âúí„ÄÅÈöòÈñÄÊ≤ôÁÅò)= The beach in front of Lintou Park stretches across four villages, including Jianshan (Â∞ñÂ±±), Wuni (ÁÉèÊ≥•), Lintou (ÊûóÊäï) and Aimen (ÈöòÈñÄ), rounding to a total of over 3,000 meters. It is the longest beach in the entire Penghu, surrounding the south coast of Hushi Township (ÊπñË•øÈÑâ). The sand on the beach is thin and smooth, the water is clear and clean. Originally obscure (it is next to the No. 9 public cemetery), people initially didn't pay attention to the beach at all. With the help of the Northeast monsoon, sand here were started to swept away and the beach was gradually disappearing. However, starting from 1998, \\"Li Tianyu\\", head of Aimen Village (ÈöòÈñÄÊùë), started reforming the community beach himself with the help of his son, putting up street lamps and nets to stop the sand from disappearing. Their effort finally won the attention of the county government and the Penghu National Scenic Center, which listed budgets to reconstruct Aimen beach, finally making this place the beach it is today. South sea recreation area South Sea Recreation Area () includes Tongpan islet (Ê°∂Áõ§Â∂º), Hujing Island (), Wangan Township (ÊúõÂÆâÈÑâ) and Cimei Township (). Tongpan islet and Hujing islet are both known for their abundant geological features: the entire Tongpan islet is surrounded by basalt columns of clear lines that form walls, the most enriched in Penghu, and has long been known as the \\"Yellowstone Park of Penghu\\". Wangan Township (ÊúõÂÆâÈÑâ) used to be known as \\"Bazhao\\" (ÂÖ´ÁΩ©), \\"zhao\\" (ÁΩ©) in Taiwanese means \\"collective\\", which is the collection of eight islands. Since Wangan Island houses a harbor with a seabed composed by a mixture of sand beach and mud, in the early days, in addition to coastal fishery and intertidal zone fishing, local residents used to round up catches with a drag net. The sound was pretty similar to the Chinese pronunciation of ÊúõÂÆâ (wang'an), hence the name. Cimei islet (‰∏ÉÁæéÂ∂º) is the fifth largest island in Penghu, and it's situated at the south end of the archipelago. The natural terrain is well preserved on the island. The spot has had several names during history: between 1662 and 1722, Cimei islet was called \\"Nan Islet\\" (South islet, ÂçóÂ∂º), later on the name was changed to \\"Nanda Islet\\" (big south islet, ÂçóÂ§ßÂ∂º). During the last days of the Qing Dynasty, the name was changed again to \\"Da islet\\" (big islet, Â§ßÂ∂º), and this name was used until after the retrocession of Taiwan to the Republic of China in 1945. In 1949, the fourth mayor of Penghu County, Mr. Liu Yanfu (ÂäâÁáïÂ§´), agreed to change the official name of the islet to \\"Cimei\\" (in Mandarin Chinese it means seven beauties, ‰∏ÉÁæé). The local legend says that there were seven beautiful women on the island that, in order to avoid being raped by pirates, committed suicide throwing themselves into a water well. The site of the well is now revered as the tomb of the seven. =Tongpan Geology Park (Ê°∂Áõ§Âú∞Ë≥™ÂÖ¨Âúí)= Tongpan islet is 6 nautical miles off the coast of Magong Island. The entire island is surrounded by columns of basalt. The columnar joints and platy joints on this island are all very well developed: being originally a hexagon or a pentagon, the rock columns are now pretty much circular on the edges due to erosion. The color has also faded due to oxidation, some parts of the basalt columns have already been transformed into a ball shape. There is an abrasion platform on the southwestern coast of Tongpan that has a concentric circles formed by the basalt lava, called the \\"lotus platform\\" (ËìÆËä±Â∫ß). =Hujing Island Recreation Area (Ëôé‰∫ïÂ∂ºÈÅäÊÜ©ÂçÄ)= Hujing Island sits seven nautical miles off the coast of Magong City. The trip from there takes about 25 minutes by boat. The seventh largest island in Penghu is flat and low in the center, rising up on the east and west, with basaltic transverse joints lined up along the coast. When the tide ebbs, visitors can see the clear sea water, which is what makes this place, \\"Hujing Clear Deep\\" (Ëôé‰∫ïÊæÑÊ∑µ), one of the eight best known sights in Penghu. There is also a legend: the legend of \\"Hujing Sunken City\\" (Ëôé‰∫ïÊ≤àÂüé). It says that there was something that resembled a decadent city wall lying at the bottom of the ocean beneath Hujing. There has never been a real answer as to what the truth really is, and there has long been two discrepant theories among academics: one states that \\"the sunken ancient city is the basaltic columnar joint terrain extended under the sea from Tongpan and Hujing, therefore forming the false impression of a sunken city\\". The other theory says that there must be another reason for it, because the structure is documented in historical literature, and not only is in the ancient history books, but also in many local legends that name this unusual sight. =Yuanyang Hole, Zangjun Cave (È¥õÈ¥¶Á™ü„ÄÅËóèËªçÊ¥û)= \\"Mandarin ducks hole\\" (Yuanyang Hole) is situated northeast of Wangan Island. It is a naturally formed valley. Legend says that in the early days, there were many water holes here, and mandarin ducks used to dabble with water and rest here, hence it was named \\"Yuanyang Hole\\" (È¥õ, yuan, means male Mandarin duck -Aix galericulata- and È¥¶, yang, means female Mandarin duck). There is an islet that forms a barrier on the sea that protects the place from strong waves. The islet has a mountain that resembles a horse (È¶¨, ma, in Mandarin Chinese), so the islet is called Ma'an Mountain Islet (È¶¨ÈûçÂ±±Â∂º). Taking this into consideration, the place was transformed into an important Japanese Navy base during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan and Penghu. The origins of Zangjun Cave are closely associated with this period of the history of Taiwan too. In 1944, during the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese Army forced the residents of Wangan and Zangjun islands to dig this cave to store gunpowder and weapons. It was also designed to be used as a bomb shelter for residents to cover from air raids. Just before it was to be completed, Japan declared its unconditional surrender, and the base was abandoned. Many of the caves initially built have collapsed, but some of them can still be seen. =Tiantai Hill= Tiantai Hill () is situated on Wangan Islet. Gangqiu Grassland (Â≤°‰∏òËçâÂéü) is the highest place on Tiantai Hill. Nearby, the place for the famous Penghu aragonite can be seen. The surrounding grassland is flat, with occasional cattle or goats trotting by. Tiantai Hill has become the best place to watch Wangan Islet and Hua islet from a distance. Tiantai Hill is a piece of micro- gabbro rock with sheeting joints. There is a magnificent basalt landscape beneath the sea cliff on the west side and visitors will also see a hole of about 30 meters high that leads directly to the sea. Some \\"stone flowers\\" can also be seen. =Wang'ankou beach= Wang'ankou Beach () is called the \\"Dream Beach\\" because of its soft white sand accompanied by clear blue ocean. Whenever the tide rises, the clean white beach will enter the clear blue ocean. When watched from the distance, it looks just like a skirt, swaying in the wind. The beach is also a place green turtles migrate back to. From May to October, visitors can see the crawl marks on the beach left behind by the turtles. Professional guides provide tourists with the necessary explanations. =Wangan Green Turtle Tourism and Conservation Center= Wangan Green Turtle Tourism and Conservation Center In 1994, the first green turtle carrying a satellite tracker set out from Wangan in Penghu, heading North crossed the Taiwan Strait, through the East China Sea Shelf, ending up in an island south of Ky≈´sh≈´ in Japan. The turtle spent three years and traveled 3,400 kilometers back to Penghu, providing an important record for the research of green turtles in Taiwan. Many beaches on the island of Taiwan were recorded to have sea turtles coming ashore to lay eggs, but as development changed the coastal environment, fewer places were able to support natural life. Today, there are only a few places left in the island of Taiwan, but the reserve in Wangan Township of Penghu County is a place where green turtles visit more often and more steady to lay eggs. Shouldn't be a surprise, considering the low level of development of the area. Standing southeast of Wangan islet, there is a building shaped like a sea turtle: it's the Wangan Green Turtle Tourism and Conservation Center. =Zhongshe Historical House (‰∏≠Á§æÂè§Âéù)= This spot is one of the more well-preserved traditional houses in Penghu County. Originally named \\"Flower House\\" (Ëä±ÂÆÖ), the legend says that when this village was firstly established, their ancestors looked at the local terrain, and discovered that the mountains surrounding the place were just like lotus petals. Therefore, they firstly named the land around \\"the heart of the flower\\" (Â±±‰ªîÂ∞æÈ†Ç, Shanziweiding) and built a house, thus naming it \\"Flower House\\", also meaning that the house that was built at the heart of the flower. In 1971, the late president Chiang Ching-kuo visited the flower house, and observing that it sits in the middle of other four villages in Wangan Township, renamed it \\"Zhongshe\\" (‰∏≠Á§æ, the village in the middle). The village is filled with ancient houses that are built of coral. There were originally over 80 sanheyuan (‰∏âÂêàÈô¢, old three-section compound house), and now only about 50 of them are still well-preserved. The architectural style of the historical houses in Zhongshe Village is called \\"one stamp\\" style sanheyuan (‰∏ÄÈ°ÜÂç∞Âºè‰∏âÂêàÈô¢Âª∫ÁØâ). =Double-Heart of Stacked Stones= Double-Heart of Stacked Stones There are a total of 558 stone weirs in Penghu, and up to 88 of them are distributed around Jibei islet, ranking first in the world both in terms of number and density. Local ancestors fed generations of offspring toiling away with these stone weir. Cimei islet has only one stone weir, but because it is shaped like two hearts, it is famous for being the Double-Heart of Stacked Stones. Originally, the stacked stones was built out of basalt and coral reefs as traditional traps for fishing. Today, the catches have gradually decreased, but the twin hearts design of the stone weir attracts endless tourists here. Twin hearts stone weir is the most well-preserved stone weir in the entire of Penghu. Visitors should check the tide ebb time for the day to see the complete twin hearts shaped stone weir. Every year, a Penghu Stone Weir Festival (ÊæéÊπñÂú∞ÂçÄÁúæÂ§öÁü≥Êª¨‰∏≠) is held. This is a very big event for tourism in Penghu, together with the Penghu Gourmet Carnival. =Seven Beauties Tomb= Situated 500 meters southeast of Nanhu Port in Cimei Township, the Seven Beauties Tomb () is what remains of a well-known story of chastity. The story is also the origin of its place name. There are two stone tablets next to the Seven Beauties Tomb, on the left, is the Seven Beauties Tomb Stone established by the Japanese, and on the right is the Seven Beauties Song tablet, telling the story and origin of the Seven Beauties Tomb. In order for the spirits of the seven beauties to have a place to dwell, residents in Cimei built seven little houses next to the tomb, and placed seven sets of makeup in front of the tomb as offerings for them. Legend has it that during the Ming Dynasty, a group of pirates came ashore from the southern coast of Cimei. At that time, all the men on the island were out on the sea fishing, with the exception of children and old men. Women were also in the inland. Among them, there were seven ladies who were working nearby in the mountains, doing their laundry beside a water well when they were attacked by Japanese pirates. To avoid being raped by the pirates, the group decided to commit suicide by plunging into the water well. Afterwards, residents filled the water well with soil, and seven lushly catalpa bungei grew later on. In 1949, Mayor Liu Yanfu (ÂäâÁáïÂ§´) and General He Zhihao (‰ΩïÂøóÊµ©) came to visit. General He was inspired by this story and wrote down a Seven Beauties Song on the spot, which was later carved onto the stone tablet; the song goes: ‰∏ÉÁæé‰∫∫ÂÖÆÁôæÂ£ÅÂßøÔºåÊä±Ë≤ûÊãíÁµïÂÖÆÊ≠ªÈö®‰πãÔºå Ëã±È≠ÇÊ∞∏ÂØÑÂ≠§Ëä≥Ê®πÔºå‰∫ï‰∏äÈï∑Êò•ÂÖÆÈñãÊªøÊûù \\"the seven beauties are all innocent, and would rather die than be disgraced; their brave spirits will forever be on the trees, which will bloom forever on the well.\\" The story of the seven beauties willing to die protecting their chastity was thus recorded, and the place was enlarged and became \\"Seven Beauties Chastity Garden\\" (‰∏ÉÁæé‰∫∫Ë≤ûÁØÄÂúí). =Little Taiwan= Little Taiwan Little Taiwan sits in Donghu Village (Êù±ÊπñÊùë) of Cimei Township. The place is called this way because looking down from a gazebo, visitors can see the result of years of wave erosion, forming an abrasion platform shaped like the island of Taiwan on a reduced scale, hence, it is called Cimei Little Taiwan (‰∏ÉÁæéÂ∞èÂè∞ÁÅ£); there is also a rock shaped like Gueishan Island (ÈæúÂ±±Â≥∂) in the same spot: both structures look even more obvious when the tide is low. =Great Lion Scenic Area= Also located in Cimei, the Great Lion Scenic Area () overlooks Longcheng (ÈæçÂüï, \\"shaped like a dragon\\"). The name itself suggests what the place is like: standing high up on the hilltop looking down, visitors can actually see the body, the head and the tail of a dragon, even the foams splashed by the waves seem like white dragons swimming. Longcheng is an abrasion platform with pot holes and chessboard rocks. =Yueli Recreation Area (ÊúàÈØâÊ∏ØÈÅäÊÜ©ÂçÄ)= The Yueli Bay (ÊúàÈØâÁÅ£) sits southeast of Cimei, forming a beautiful arc-shaped bay with white coral and a sand beach; this is the only sand beach on Cimei Island, along with rich recreational resources, and reef coral terrain formed by the coral reefs connected to the island; It is also a known place for diving activities, its corals and tropical fishes. Conservation vs development Penghu is a favorite summer tourist destination which attracts thousands of weekenders. However, the Scenic Area is mostly visited during the summer: when the autumn gales begin to blow in October, the archipelago becomes deserted until April, when warmer weather seems to thaw the local tourism industry. The islands' climate has also a negative impact on its economy, as it is adverse to agriculture, and its isolated location rules out large-scale manufacturing development. Generations of Penghu residents have made their living from the sea, but over-fishing has severely depleted stocks and damaged the local fishing industry. Tourism has become the only way out of economic hardship. But for a county with a thinning population, which receives more than 50% percent of its annual budget from central government subsidies, a solution is needed. Several projects aimed at attracting tourists in winter have been tried with only limited success: During July 2003, the Public Construction Commission and the Penghu National Scenic Area Administration under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication's Tourism Bureau agreed a development project in Jibei Islet (ÂêâË≤ùÂ∂º): the more than NT$ 300 million investment would turn 22 hectares of land and 210 hectares of surrounding sea into an international recreational tourist spot. Shopping malls, restaurants, a luxury five-star hotel containing 350 rooms and parking lots would be established. Shortly after, the concerned authorities invited bids for the project, which aimed at boosting local tourism. This project soon met with strong opposition from local green activists: \\"What we see here is a solution for an unsatisfactory situation that actually makes things worse,\\" Chen Yufeng (Èô≥ÁéâÂ≥∞), an ecologist, said. \\"Why does the government intend to make the islet a source of pollutants, which would affect not only surrounding waters but also neighboring countries?\\" he also added. He wasn't alone in his protest: Green Formosa Front chairman Wu Dongjie (Âê≥Êù±ÂÇë) visited officials of the National Scenic Area Administration, arguing that the bidding process should be delayed: \\"The environmental impact assessment has not been done at all,\\" Wu said. However, and according to Hong Zhiguang (Ê¥™ÂøóÂÖâ), an official of the administration, the project was well- designed and took into consideration environmental concerns: \\"We have set aside 10 hectares of land for scientific activities,\\" Hong said. In addition, Hong said, the government and developers would jointly recycle all waste water and have all garbage either incinerated or buried at an existing landfill. Gambling controversy Some local residents expressed their concern about the economic development of the archipelago, shortly after the China Airlines Flight 611 fell near the county. Following the crash of the China Airlines plane on 25 May 2002, the island's scenic area went through its quietest summer in years. This situation once again caused many to look to legalizing gambling as a way to attract tourists. Such a move met some opposition within the county: many tourism experts and local residents said that legalizing gambling was an irresponsible way to promote Penghu's tourism. In response to pressure from Penghu residents during 2000, the central government agreed to give between NT$ 100 million and NT$ 200 million to the Penghu National Scenic Area Administration Office to promote the islands' tourism. This budget, however, did little to develop Penghu or its tourism industry: no large-scale projects were completed and, despite numerous promotions, the plentiful tourism resources of Penghu failed to draw crowds. \\"The money was spent on constructing new harbors based on election concerns, which resulted in the many unnecessary harbors in Penghu now,\\" said an anti-gambling activist in Penghu. There are now 67 harbors servicing Penghu's 97 villages. \\"The quality of these harbors is poor, and Penghu's coastline was seriously damaged by their construction,\\" the same activist explained. To promote the Scenic Area, the local government hosted swimming events, fireworks displays and parades of elaborately decorated vehicles. Such options met the opposition of some councilors: \\"These events can't distinguish Penghu's qualities at all,\\" said Gao Zhipeng (È´òÊ§çÊæé), a Democratic Progressive Party councilor from Penghu County. \\"We even spent money on importing the fireworks and flowers from Taiwan\\". Another controversial side-effect of the tourism drive is the construction of large, international-standard hotels, which will probably be the setting for the casinos if the pro-gambling lobby has its way. During the year 2000, the Scenic Area administration confirmed there were five holiday resorts being planned. The biggest would occupy more than 11 hectares, but only two of them, would target families and international tourists with facilities such as a shopping mall, spa, nightclubs and casinos. Supporters of legalizing gambling said it would attract investment to the islands and create job opportunities for local residents. They also argued that gambling in Penghu would bring more than NT$ 20 billion in tax revenues for the local government. Other benefits would apparently be free medical treatment and transportation, NT$ 10,000 a month for elderly residents and free education for children, although details of these benefits were not explained. Critics argue that gambling would not only damage the islands' security and environment, but also increase the cost of living.

Raimundo Valenzuela  Life & career  Valenzuela studied music under his father, Lucas: he learnt piano, viola, percussion, but was first employed by Orquesta Flor de Cuba as a trombonist. He was playing for La Flor in the Alhambra theatre in Havana in 1869, when a group of Spanish anti-revolutionary volunteers attacked the theatre and its patrons. That night the theatre had been performing anti-colonial works for the benefit of rebels declaring Cuban independence, in what became known as the Ten Years' War. He established his band from the remains of Flor de Cuba after the death of its leader, Juan de Dios Alfonso. Like its forebear, the orchestra was a t√≠pica in format, based mostly on wind instruments. It was, like Flor de Cuba, the most popular t√≠pica of its day. Valenzuela's bands played everywhere in Havana. They played for balls, the theatre, carnavals, and for all racial groups and all levels of society. Raimundo contributed financially and personally to the development of the Cuban War of Independence in 1895. When Raimundo died in 1905, his brother Pablo Valenzuela became Director of the orchestra. Valenzuela's compositions were mostly danzones, such as El negro bueno, Mar√≠a Belen, Los empleados de Tac√≥n; and the zarzuela La mulata Mar√≠a.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p222Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. vol 4, p257  The era of danz√≥n  The danz√≥n developed first in Matanzas and Havana. The second phase of its evolution had been started by Miguel Fa√≠lde, who was a close friend of Valenzuela. Fa√≠de's was the top band in Matanzas, as Valenzuela was in Havana. They often played together on big occasions. In 1883, for example, there was a double bill at the Teatro Tac√≥n, where the two bands played alternatively all night. It was in 1883 that Valenzuela added a third segment to the two-part structure created by Fa√≠lde, so completing the danz√≥n's musical form. By the mid-1880s the danz√≥n had become so popular that both Fa√≠lde and Valenzuela created back-up bands so as to be able to play two venues on the same night.Chasteen, John Charles 2004.

This concept was discovered by Nick Laskin who coined the term fractional quantum mechanics. Fundamentals Standard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the matrix mechanics, the Schr√∂dinger equation and the Feynman path integral. The Feynman path integralR. P. Feynman and A. R. Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals ~McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965 is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by Nick Laskin (1999) as a result of expanding the Feynman path integral, from the Brownian-like to the L√©vy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the L√©vy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of quantum mechanics. If the Feynman path integral leads to the well known Schr√∂dinger equation, then the path integral over L√©vy trajectories leads to the fractional Schr√∂dinger equation. The L√©vy process is characterized by the L√©vy index Œ±, 0 < Œ± ‚â§ 2\\\\. At the special case when Œ± = 2 the L√©vy process becomes the process of Brownian motion. The fractional Schr√∂dinger equation includes a space derivative of fractional order Œ± instead of the second order (Œ± = 2) space derivative in the standard Schr√∂dinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schr√∂dinger equation is a fractional differential equation in accordance with modern terminology.S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993 This is the key point to launch the term fractional Schr√∂dinger equation and more general term fractional quantum mechanics.

Construction work for the Rosie Hackett Bridge across the River Liffey began in April 2012, with this bridge carrying the southbound Luas Cross City track. The existing St. Stephen's Green stop on the Luas Green Line subsequently became a through-point for the new line, with the stop's platforms extended to accommodate the proposed introduction of longer trams in 2018. The extension opened on 9 December 2017, with the St. Stephen's Green stop remaining operational throughout the works. Metrolink Plans for the proposed Dublin Metro called for St Stephen's Green to be used as the southern terminus of a line to Belinstown, with a tunnel at the north-western corner of the park. While originally targeted for 2013, these plans were subsequently indefinitely deferred. Similar plans for a DART network extension proposed an underground station at St Stephen's Green. Though targeted to start in 2015, these works were also indefinitely deferred. In March 2018, the Dublin Metro was rebranded under the name \\"Metrolink\\", and proposed to run from Swords in the north, passing through Dublin Airport and the city centre to points in the south.

Purchased in 1747 by the planter and politician Dr George H. Steuart, it remains the home of Steuart's descendants to this day. Steuart grew wealthy during the colonial era thanks to proprietarial patronage and the forced labor of enslaved people, but his family's prosperity and status was much reduced by the American Revolution and later by the American Civil War. History Memoirs written by Richard Sprigg Steuart suggest that Dodon was originally patented to one James Stewart in 1669, a Scottish immigrant from Perth.Nelker, 132 However, land records held by Anne Arundel County show that it was originally owned by a Dr Francis Stockett, who \\"held 'Dodon', 664 acres\\", in 1668.Warfield, J. D., p.93, The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland Retrieved February 25, 2010 Whatever its early origins, the property was thereafter owned by the Warman family and, in 1747, Stephen Warman sold it to Dr George H. Steuart (1700‚Äì1784) of Argaty, Perthshire, Scotland.Nelker, 89, 90Harrison, Bruce, p.559, The Family Forest Descendants of Lady Joan Beaufort Retrieved October 2010 At Dodon, Steuart enslaved people to farm the profitable cash crop of tobacco. As one of the earliest members of the Maryland Jockey Club, Steuart was a horse racing enthusiast. His most famous horse was Dungannon, which he imported from England to compete against the stable of his rival Charles Carroll. The Annapolis Subscription Plate, the first recorded formal horse race in Maryland, was held in May 1743, and was won by Dungannon.Nelker, 118 The silver cup ‚Äî actually more of a bowl than a plate ‚Äî is now displayed in the Baltimore Museum of Art. It is the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland and the second-oldest horse racing trophy in America. Steuart held a number of colonial offices, including Mayor of Annapolis from 1759-63. He was also Commissioner of the Land Office, served at the Court of Admiralty, and was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of The Horse Militia in 1753 by Governor Horatio Sharpe. Dodon formed a small part of the overall plantation economy of the Southern States, which forced enslaved people to produce cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops for export to England. Maryland planters also made extensive use of indentured servants and penal labor. An extensive system of rivers facilitated the movement of produce from inland plantations to the Atlantic coast for export. Baltimore was the second- most important port in the 18th-century South, after Charleston, South Carolina. Revolutionary War Steuart also inherited land in Perthshire, Scotland, which caused him considerable political difficulties during the American Revolutionary War. Loyalty to the Revolution would have caused him to forfeit his Scottish estates, and, at the outbreak of hostilities, Steuart left America for Scotland. He thereafter divided his estates, giving Dodon to his wife Ann (n√©e Digges), with instructions on which of his children, loyal to the new American nation, would inherit. Steuart himself would never return to Maryland or see his family again. Ann remained at Dodon until her death in 1811. According to letters of her Grandson Richard Sprigg Steuart (1797‚Äì1876), she lived \\"comfortably, but she kept at home because her good husband was called by the mob a Tory.\\"Nelker, 128 Civil War Confederacy and smuggled horses and quinine south to Confederate forces.

(1860) Retrieved February 25, 2010 Horses were raised and trained at Dodon then smuggled south for Confederate forces, as well as medical supplies such as quinine. As a result, Dodon was often raided by Union troops, regularly forcing Steuart to flee into hiding. As one family member later recalled: > Dr Steuart was constantly away from home, avoiding the raiding parties from > the Northern soldiers who sought to capture him, because of the help he gave > the South by secretly sending supplies of quinine, and other > necessities...to the Southern hospitals.

Steuart (1828‚Äì1903) (Known as \\"Maryland Steuart\\" to distinguish him from his fellow General J.E.B. Stuart) fought at a number of major battles including Spotsylvania, Gettysburg, Cross Keys, and Winchester, before surrendering with General Lee at Appomattox Court House. Post War Period The estate did not prosper after the war's end, in large part because the white owners could no longer enslave Black people for their labor. In 1890 Isabel and Emily Steuart, daughters of Richard Sprigg Steuart, donated the estate to the Roman Catholic Congregation of Marist Fathers, a French order founded in Lyon in 1826, to be used as a seminary and mission.Richardson, p.226Nelker, p.151 However, it was eventually repurchased by a member of the Steuart family, Annette Steuart Wise, in 1929.Nelker, p.152 Legacy Stone obelisk marking Dodon burial ground, erected by Richard Sprigg Steuart.Nelker, 131 Dodon is still home to the ninth generation of Steuarts today, who continue to farm, and to breed and train horses, as well as grow grapes and make wine. The Annapolis Subscription Plate has also been revived in recent years. Parts of the original house still remain, though most was destroyed in a fire c1950.History of Dodon Farm Retrieved August 26, 2018 Dodon is not far from the expanding suburbs of Annapolis, and the remaining land has now been put into preservation through the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation, in order to prevent future development. A family graveyard, marked by a small obelisk listing the names of Steuart kin resting there, sits in a grove of trees on one of the high spots of the property. The name Dodon is said to come from the French, \\"Dieu Donne\\" meaning \\"Gift of God.\\" It may also be a derivative of the Greek, Dodona - a prehistoric oracle in Greece dedicated to Zeus and the \\"mother goddess,\\" Dione.

Structural properties In the solid state, 1,3-indandione occurs as a diketone; in water, it is partially (~2%) enolized. The enolate anion exhibits significant delocalization, and the highest electron density is on the second carbon. This explains many of chemical properties of the compound. Preparation 1,3-Indandione can be prepared by decarboxylation of the sodium salt of 2-ethoxycarbonyl-1,3-indandione, which itself is obtained by Claisen condensation of ethyl acetate and dimethyl phthalate. :400px :400px Chemical properties 1,3-Indandione is a very strong C-nucleophile.

It is a modern development which began in about 1984 with the construction of new houses in an isolated area more than a mile to the west of Dudley town centre, near the border with Sedgley, which had been mined for coal since the 19th century. Further developments of private housing took place on this land between Himley Road and Dibdale Road and by the end of the 1980s there were several hundred houses in Milking Bank, as well as a primary school. Further development took place after the demolition of nearby Burton Road Hospital in 1994, with the construction of further housing on the north side of Dibdale Road. At the end of the decade, further houses - as well as a Co-operative society supermarket - were built on the west of Milking Bank joining onto Grosvenor Road. This latest development was a mix of private homes as well as ones leased out by a housing association. The estate is served by a public house, the Meadow Lark, as well as a doctor's surgery. A Spar minimarket opened in the mid 1980s, around the time that the first houses were built. This later became a Bargain Booze store, but it was burnt down in a suspected arson attack in 2011. This was then rebuilt and for a short time opened as a Costcutter, but by January 2015 had closed. As of June 2018 this shop is now occupied by a \\"local\\" shop franchise.

It was leased to the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) in 1949, and merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1988. A new regional railroad reused the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway name in 1990 when it acquired most of the former W&LE; from the N&W.; At the end of 1944, W&LE; operated 507 miles of road and 1003 miles of track; that year it reported 2371 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 0.002 million passenger-miles. History The original Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway's oldest predecessor rail line began in Ohio, with the organization of the Carroll County Railroad on March 9, 1850. The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad was established on April 6, 1871, and was first built as a gauge narrow gauge line between Norwalk and Huron, Ohio. Service began on the new line on May 31, 1877. However, the new road was unable to attract regular traffic, or financing for expansion, and had closed within two years. With investment by railroad financier Jay Gould in 1880 and financial reorganization, the line was converted to standard gauge and construction began again. Service from Huron to Massillon, Ohio, was opened on January 9, 1882, and new lines were constructed that eventually reached the Ohio River and Toledo. The W&LE; also developed new docks on Lake Erie at Huron that opened May 21, 1884, when the first cargo of iron ore was received. In 1880, another gauge line, the Connotton Valley Railway, was formed, building north from Canton to Cleveland and then south to Coshocton and Zanesville. The Connotton Valley became the Cleveland, Canton & Southern Railroad and was converted to standard gauge in one day on November 18, 1888. The Cleveland, Canton & Southern Railroad joined the W&LE; in 1899 after its purchase at foreclosure sale, becoming W&LE;'s Cleveland Division. The railroad's Brewster, Ohio, yards in 1910. At its height, the W&LE; ran from Wheeling, West Virginia, (via the Wheeling Terminal Railway) to Lake Erie at Huron and Toledo. However, the main lines of the W&LE; never reached outside Ohio's borders. It also ran from Cleveland to Zanesville, with the lines crossing at Harmon, just east of Brewster, Ohio, which became the location of W&LE;'s corporate headquarters and locomotive shops. With two busy main stems crossing on the map of Ohio; the road's nickname for many years was \\"The Iron Cross\\". A branch between Steubenville and Martins Ferry, Ohio, was completed in 1891, which led to an indirect connection to Wheeling via the Ohio River bridge of the Wheeling Terminal Railway. The W&LE; began producing locomotives at its Brewster, Ohio, shops in 1910, and boasted one of the finest locomotive producing facilities in the country. Over the years, the W&LE; built and rolled boilers and erected fifty of their own steam locomotives, a feat never tried by many larger and more famous railroads. The W&LE; was jokingly called the \\"Wailing and Leg Weary\\" but, after several early financial embarrassments, finally found prosperity in its later life. The W&LE; was leased by the Nickel Plate Road in 1949. The Nickel Plate Road merged with Norfolk and Western Railway in 1964. The W&LE; was finally consolidated into the Norfolk and Western on September 20, 1988. ReferencesGeneral references=   * * External links *Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway Company.

The international admiration Perera has won and the national recognition he has gained have come through his achievements, acquired both in Sri Lanka and in England in different fields: cricket, analytical chemistry and quality assurance, in all of which he is academically and professionally well qualified and widely experienced. Almost on the eve of umpiring his first cricket test match in Colombo, Sri Lanka vs New Zealand, a large wayside tree crashed on and straddled his moving car, killing his chauffeur and leaving him instantaneously a paraplegic for life. Today he is a writer, speaker, author and a disability rights activist - as a fervent advocate for inclusion of all people by design - most importantly as a widely experienced and highly competent accessibility adviser and an accessor, befittingly recognised by three learned societies and several reputed bodies overseas. He is the founder and, as of 10 June 2020, holds the honorary position of Chief Executive / Secretary-General of Idiriya, a registered, not-for-profit humanitarian service organisation in Sri Lanka. Undeterred by this personal adversity, he has bounced back not only to serve humanity simultaneously in several fields over 20 years on voluntary basis but to prove beyond any doubt that he, still, remains a unique Sri Lankan displaying Ability within dis-Ability. Sri Lanka in February 2016 has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Articles 8(1) and 8(2) here clearly emphasised that States Parties shall undertake to adopt immediate effective and appropriate measures: To create awareness of the wider range of skills, merits and capabilities of persons with disabilities AND to promote recognition of their proven Abilities within dis-Abilities and of their significant contributions of national importance. Although such State initiative and action incur hardly any costs, it is indeed a tragedy that Perera remains an unsung hero and his potential and expertise goes waste in Sri Lanka. Family Perera's parents in 1999 Born to Instructor Commodore M. G. S. Perera (1 June 1917 ‚Äì 10 August 1999), Founder and the First Commandant Naval & Maritime Academy Trincomalee AND the First and Foremost Director of Naval Training, Royal Ceylon Navy. and former Senior Staff Captain / Nautical Instructor (Training of Deck Officer Cadets) Ceylon Shipping Corporation (1977‚Äì1983) and Maureen Johanna Perera (19 February 1924 - 22 October 2019), he has one sister, Deepthi C. J. Guneratne BSc (Botany), MSc (Soil Chemistry). Education Perera completed his primary and secondary education at the Royal Primary School and the Royal College, Colombo and thereafter gained BSc (Honours) from the University of Sri Lanka, Colombo in May 1975, followed by a joint MSc from the University of Colombo and the University of Birmingham, England in July 1977. He thereby qualified professionally in the field of Analytical Chemistry, specialising in the subject of Quality Assurance, in which field his outstanding contributions were internationally recognised and awarded with an honorary PhD. Professional life: 1978‚Äì1992 Perera is a Chartered Chemist (CChem.)by profession and a Registered Analytical Chemist of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in the United Kingdom. He is a Fellow (FRSC) of the RSC of which he is an honorary life member and the former hony. secretary / treasurer (1984‚Äì1992) of its section in Sri Lanka. He is also a life member and a Fellow (FIChemC) of the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon and a Fellow (FIQA) of the Institute of Quality Assurance UK. His professional career started in August 1978 as an assistant lecturer at the department of Chemistry, University of Colombo. His work thereafter in the multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing industry extended for almost 14 years, from September 1978 until July 1992. Perera started his career in industry as a production executive with Glaxo Ceylon Limited and stayed until March 1982. Mackwoods-Winthrop Limited then hired hm as the senior manager in charge of their quality assurance and analytical control divisions until March 1989, and thereafter as the senior manager of the newly established technical services department. Perera then changed over to the cosmetics and healthcare industry when Hemas Manufacturing Limited invited him to join them in August 1992 as the Director ‚Äì Senior Manager of quality assurance and product development. But it was only 14 weeks service there for Perera, as a freak road accident on 12 November 1992 made him instantaneously a paraplegic for life and cut short tragically, at the age of 36, his professional career that was just blossoming out. Cricket Career: 1972 ‚Äì Considered as a unique feat, his Professional Achievements in the Cricketing Sphere have extended to almost all possible vital avenues of the game reaching often the professional levels ‚Äì as a Player, Umpire, Scorer, Training Instructor and Examiner on its laws, Administrator, Writer, Author and, even an Activist promoting 'Accessible Facilities for All' at Cricket Stadia, etc. =Major Achievements= Perera started playing serious cricket, as a utility player who combined his undergraduate and postgraduate education with cricket. He represented regularly the University of Colombo for seven consecutive years between 1972 and 1978, and played at Inter-club Division ‚Äì One two-day tournament cricket conducted by the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) for the P. Saravanamuttu Trophy, which was then considered as the main first-class domestic cricket competition in the country. In 1975, whilst still an undergraduate, Perera qualified to become a Cricket Umpire. He is the First and Only test-match-panel Cricket Umpire the Royal College Colombo and the University of Colombo have ever produced. the Association of cricket umpires England. Sri Lanka gained test status in 1981 as a full member of the international cricket council. Yet, it was still the era when cricket scoring was hardly given any kind of importance. In the Preface to The Golden Era of Sri Lankan Cricket Leslie Cheeseman B.E.M. described Perera's endeavours as: \\"Even in those early days, the perceived extent of his unbridled enthusiasm, the level of his intended personal commitment, analytical mind, high degree of technical knowledge of the game and its governing laws, plus his unquenchable thirst for newer knowledge and practical experience at higher level of the game together with his willingness to further improve individual performance, made Perera to decide to go to England, several times at his own expense, to achieve this goal\\". Professional umpiring. Perera with Don Oslear, former test and first class cricket umpire; Lancashire vs Somerset county seconds 4-day championship match at the Old Trafford Manchester in July 1990. As a result, Perera became the FIRST Sri Lankan to be accepted and recognised by the international body the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers England as a \\"Professionally Qualified\\" Cricket Umpire (24 October 1985), Scorer (7 April 1987), then also as a 'Scorer competent in advanced scoring techniques' (25 March 1990), a Grade ‚Äì A Senior Training Instructor in the art and craft of both Cricket Scoring and Cricket Umpiring (August 1990) and finally, also as an effective Examiner (1 November 1998) on the Laws of Cricket, all offices of this reputed Association. For 15 weeks of the British summer in 1990, Perera, afforded the opportunity, umpired cricket matches in England in Lancashire County four-day Second Eleven and in top Leagues in the area, viz. Bolton & District Cricket Association, Bolton League and Central Lancashire.

With him are (on his left) Godfrey Evans, Christopher Martin- Jenkins, Brian Johnston (and on his right) David Lloyd and Bill Frindall (Scorer). After 17 years of hard work, sacrifice, loads of patience and, refusal to bow down to pressure and change his ways to please anyone at the centre, Perera, at the age of 36, made his way to the Six-member Sri Lanka Test-Match-Panel of Cricket Umpires on 10 November 1992. In 10 days' time Perera was due ‚Äì formerly appointed by the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka ‚Äì to stand in his first test match in Colombo Sri Lanka vs New Zealand. It was so..... very close, yet so... far for Perera. =Significant Contributions= In 1996, he was highly commended by the then Sri Lanka Cricket Board in becoming of great assistance to them, as single-handedly, Perera accepted and satisfactorily completed its highly technical assignment to streamline the rules and regulations governing 2, 3 and 4-day Division ‚Äì 1, Division ‚Äì 2 and under 24 Major Tournament Cricket in Sri Lanka. Seated on a Wheelchair, battling paraplegia and balancing a laptop, he even Authored Two A ‚Äì 4 size Internationally famed books on Cricket, The Golden Era of Sri Lankan Cricket (May 1999) and Thinking Cricket (September 2001) . They were also Published by him without any external financial support. First formal cricket scorer training in Sri Lanka. Perera with the senior scorers of Sri Lanka at this programme held at Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo in December 1999. In December 1999, at the request of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, Perera designed and conducted over four half-days the FIRST Formal Training and Evaluation Programme for the top Sri Lanka Cricket Scorers, in preparation for the under-19 Cricket World Cup Tournament that was held in Sri Lanka in January 2000. Perera has also turned a pioneer dis-Ability Activist campaigning in Sri Lanka for Accessible built Sports Environments for Al and user-friendly Facilities. =Honours and Recognitions= On 8 May 1999 the Association of Cricket Umpires Sri Lanka, in recognition of his twenty four long years of dedicated services, unstinting loyal support and unlimited contributions towards the betterment of the umpiring fraternity in Sri Lanka, at times at great personal sacrifice, unanimously elected Perera a 'Life Member'. A historic achievement. Perera receives the award from the then high commissioner for India in Sri Lanka, Her Excellency Nirupama Rao, watched by the Hon. Mayor Danasiri Amaratunga, at the literary awards festival 2005 organised by the Dehiwala Municipal Council at its auditorium on 30 September 2005. Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanack (millennium edition) has seen fit to regard Perera as one of only eight Cricketing People of the World to be specifically recognised for his many outstanding achievements and worthwhile significant contributions to the game. He also became a recipient (1999) of the Star of Asia award for Excellence in Sports. On 30 January 2003, Perera and 15 other Retired Test Match and One-day International Panel Senior Cricket Umpires of Sri Lanka were recognised for the dedicated long years of Thankless Services rendered to the game and felicitated. On 30 September 2005, Perera, for his Internationally Recognised Significant Contributions to Cricket Literature, became the First Author in the annals of his Country's (Sri Lanka) Sports Literature to be recognised and honoured formally at a literary awards festival. On 30 August 2007 again, Perera was amongst Five Cricket Scorers recognised and honoured befittingly for the untiring and admirable services rendered to this vital aspect of the game. dis-Ability Activist: 1997 ‚Äì Perera leads a panel discussion offering numerous insights on 'Accessibility to Built Environments' at Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo in July 2006. Perera is the pioneer campaigner in Sri Lanka for Social Inclusion focusing equal opportunity, justice and dignity for People of ALL Abilities in day-to-day life ‚Äì the key concept in this context being universal design for inclusion of people.- (meaning construction of environments that enable by design so as to include all and exclude none.) =Significant Contributions= As a dis- Ability rights activist, Perera has promoted the concept of establishing a society that does not marginalise or discriminate against people on the basis of limited mobility, either for short time, or long time or life time in attending to normal day-to-day life ‚Äì the principal problem in this context. \\"Ability within dis-Ability\\". Perera the writer, speaker and presenter at Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo on 15 March 2006. He is a fervent advocate of built environments and facilities that are a joy rather than a trial to use by everyone. He has constantly used the weapon of persuasion to convince people that the cumulative result of even small changes could be substantial. Perera has also pioneered the campaign in Sri Lanka for accessible tourism, recognising it as an overlooked growth market and new profit resource for Sri Lanka. Perera was also instrumental in proposing to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) and paving the way in persuading them to establish the first Sri Lanka standard for design in building construction SLS ISO TR 9527:2006 in 2007, a fact which Dr. A. R. L. Wijesekera, the then Chairman SLSI, recognised as an achievement of national importance. Accessibility at the First Post Office in Sri Lanka. Perera, with the then Deputy Postmaster- General Kingsley Wimalaratne, cuts the ribbon to open the accessible pathway at Mount Lavinia Post Office on 24 January 2007. Perera is watched by (on left) Marise Deckker Chairperson Astron Ltd. Ratmalana (funder). =Major Achievements= Perera successfully pursue single handed a fundamental rights application. Perera, appearing at all times in person on a wheelchair and seeking redress for physically disabled persons accessing new public buildings, successfully pursued single handed a public interest litigation fundamental rights application under reference SCFR 221/2009. He argued the need to have the disability access laws and regulations already enacted some years ago, fully enforced and implemented from this date, so that, ALL Key Building Parts of NEW public buildings in Sri Lanka ‚Äì toilets and wash facilities in particular ‚Äì in the commercial, recreational, social, educational, residential and industrial categories, shall be constructed in accordance with standards and design requirements specified in the regulations. His endeavours were aimed at minimising safety hazards for everyone, preventing further colossal losses the people and country incur, promoting social inclusion for all and enhancing productive and gainful opportunities for the widest possible range of persons, dis-abled persons in particular, in their day-to-day lives. Perera gets a fillip for accessibility rights Thanks to the commitment and voluntary efforts of Perera with foresight, the inherent right of dis-Abled persons to have unhindered access to public buildings and facilities received a substantial boost when the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka gave a landmark order on 27 April 2011, further strengthening the earlier given order of 14 October 2009. The Supreme Court order, Perera ensured, further stated that all authorities empowered to approve building plans or issue 'Certificates of Conformity' for public buildings shall refrain from doing so in respect of any new buildings which violated these orders. Building planners, architects, builders and local authorities together with owners and co-owners, as equally responsible partners, will be required to adhere to the legal requirements in regard to accessibility. Any violations of these court orders shall be a serious punishable offence incurring punitive repercussions. Perera for the petitioner present again in person saw the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka order on 17 June 2013 the Agencies of the State to ensure that those of them who are disabled or with restricted ability be given every opportunity to integrate freely with the community. At the Presidential Elections held on 26 January 2010, Perera, in consultation with the Commissioner of Elections initiated voluntary action towards enabling the staff on duty at polling stations to be sensitive to the special needs of dis-Abled voters, including those with significant physical, manual and visual impairments and worked towards providing polling stations and polling booths that would be more approachable and accessible to the dis- Abled persons. For the first time in Sri Lanka history, with endeavors to make hear their voices in the Parliament, Perera led a group of professionals and intellectuals with restricted ability to contest the Parliamentary Elections of 17 August 2015.A Group of professionals with ‚ÄòRestricted Ability‚Äô contest Parliamentary Elections.

Retrieved 25 December 2015 Perera's untiring efforts to arrest a National disaster Then again in October 2018, Dr Perera stated: \\"Despite 13 years elapsing since a comprehensive set of Access Regulations were made and passed unanimously in Parliament AND reinforced by an Order given under SCFR 221/2009 to over 70 respondents by the Supreme Court on 27 April 2011 AND Sri Lanka on 8 February 2016 ratifying the legally binding agreement of UN Convention for the Protection of the Rights of the dis-Abled, STILL, there is large scale and substantial non-compliance of NEW constructions with and non- enforcement of Accessibility Regulations. Perera fights to arrest destructive marginalisation. Perera as his moral duty argued for the need to oppose any actions causing further delays of meaningful implementation of this earlier order given by the Supreme Court and thereby to arrest soonest this national disaster and hence successfully pursued again single-handedly a Nationally and Internationally important Public Interest Fundamental Rights second Application No: SCFR 273 / 2018. Successful persuasion to minimize tormenting consequences. His renewed endeavours were aimed here at minimising tormenting consequences continually STILL faced by, not less than an estimated 20% of Sri Lanka's population ‚Äì i.e. 4 Million People ‚Äì experiencing impediments to their physical mobility, stability, dexterity and / or eyesight ‚Äì in accessing and using in daily life even the NEW constructions. These include potential threat to their safety, marginalisation beyond expectations and unwanted dependency on others and thereby potentially CRIPPLING precious human life economically, socially and mentally ‚Äì remain the most vulnerable, voiceless yet the country's largest minority group. Supreme Court again in landmark judgement. Perera saw the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, after hearing submissions and arguments, in a 28-page long LANDMARK judgement given on 18 April 2019, clearly stated: \\"The stark truth is: Meaningful implementation of these Accessibility Laws by the State and the Private Sector is a continual failure and thereby, beyond doubt, even at numerous NEWLY built environments, there is destructive marginalisation\\". \\"It has caused continual violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(h) of the Sri Lanka Constitution, to the Petitioner, Dr. Perera and thereby denial of opportunity of equality for SAFE access and their use in daily life by the Country‚Äôs largest minority ‚Äì others similarly circumstanced with restricted ability / mobility\\". =Honours and Recognitions= As depicted in the five photographs below, Dr. Perera perhaps became the first person with dis- Abilities in Sri Lanka to be recognised in Sri Lanka for his outstanding voluntary contributions to the community ‚Äì to the promotion and establishment of 'Accessibility to the Built environment', enhancing safety and social inclusion with empowerment of people with all abilities. Perera has aggressively promoted in Sri Lanka the concept of 'Social Inclusion for All' with the Vision: Accessible Sri Lanka focusing on built environments that does not marginalise or cause discrimination against people on the grounds of inevitable diversity in ability and campaigned against arbitrary categorisation of people. Undeterred by his personal adversity, playing eight different roles over 17 consecutive years for the promotion of Accessibility Rights in Sri Lanka, he was recognised and appreciated in 2016 for his outstanding voluntary contributions to the community ‚Äì please see below. First, in September 2016, he was named the \\"Sri Lankan of the Year 2016\\" under the category of Unsung Hero; and then on the UN Day in October 2016 he was presented with the APEX award by the United Nations Association of Sri Lanka.

The arc first appears in Captain America (vol. 5) #25‚Äì42. The first issue of the story arc, Captain America #25, was the highest selling comic for the month of its release. The story arc had wide-sweeping effects throughout the Marvel Universe and was accompanied by the miniseries Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America. Plot Captain America's death. Art by Steve Epting. In the aftermath of Civil War, Captain America is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he is assassinated per the order of the Red Skull. Crossbones snipes at him while Sharon Carter (Agent 13; Cap's girlfriend), who has been brainwashed by Doctor Faustus, posing as a S.H.I.E.L.D. psychiatrist, delivers the killing shot. Overwhelmed with guilt, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Tony Stark and Black Widow hunt Captain America's murderers. Falcon, Captain America's old partner, follows his own leads to find the killers. Meanwhile, Bucky Barnes decides to kill Tony Stark, blaming him for Captain America's death. After receiving a letter written by Steve Rogers telling him that the Captain America legacy should continue, and look out for Bucky, Stark shows Bucky Barnes the letter and proposes to make him the new Captain America. Bucky agrees on the condition that he can be an independent agent who doesn't answer to Stark, S.H.I.E.L.D., or the Initiative. The Red Skull fakes the death of Aleksander Lukin, whose mind he inhabits, begins using Kronas Corporation's vast holdings to economically cripple the United States, before having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents brainwashed by Doctor Faustus open fire on crowds of protesters in front of the White House. The Red Skull continues his assault by engineering a riot via the placing of Kronas security troops and utilizing drugged water in a protest on the Lincoln Monument. The Skull also kidnaps Sharon Carter, who now knows that she is pregnant with Steve Rogers' child. All of the Red Skull's actions benefit his puppet politician, Gordon Wright, who quickly becomes a popular third party Presidential candidate. Once elected, Wright will lead the country directly into a police state secretly controlled by the Red Skull. The Skull also plans to transfer his consciousness into Sharon's unborn child, apparently sired by Steve Rogers himself and potentially having inherited his Project Rebirth enhancements. Both schemes fail because of the impatience and incompetence of the Skull's daughter ‚Äî her near-fatal attack on Sharon Carter causes her to lose the baby, and she intentionally botches her pseudo-assassination of Gordon Wright by attempting to kill him in earnest. Faustus has surreptitiously tampered with Sharon's programming, allowing her to rebel, and before escaping shoots Lukin to death. Black Widow and the Falcon lead a S.H.I.E.L.D. raid at the Red Skull's compound. Most of the Skull's agents are captured. The Red Skull escapes, however. His consciousness is transferred from Lukin to one of the robot bodies used by Arnim Zola.

He entered the University of G√∂ttingen, but soon left, and, taking service in the Austrian army, took part in the Russian campaign of 1812, and fought in the following year at Dresden, Kulm and Leipzig.

In 1830 and 1831 he took part in the Dutch campaign in Belgium, and in 1844, after being promoted to the rank of general, was sent on an important mission to the Dutch East Indies to inquire into the state of their military defences. In 1847, he was appointed governor at the Hague, and commandant in South Holland. In the spring of 1848 he was in Germany, and on the outbreak of the revolutionary troubles he accepted the invitation of the government of Baden to take the command against the insurgent \\"free companies\\" (Freischaaren) in the Hecker Uprising led by Friedrich Hecker. At Kandern, on 20 April, he made a vain effort to persuade the leaders to submit, and was about to order his troops to attack, when he was mortally wounded by the bullets of the insurgents.

Courtesy lights sometimes allow the user to disobey traffic laws such as speed limits, but usually not laws applying to stop signs or stop lights. Courtesy lights should not be confused with emergency warning lights used in conjunction with audible warning systems (sirens) for emergency vehicles such as police cars, fire apparatus, and ambulances, nor should they be confused with warning lights as used by tow trucks, snow plows, construction vehicles and school buses to increase awareness especially when moving slowly or stopped in the roadway. The term is also used to refer to the internal car light that comes on automatically when a door is opened. Blue courtesy lights, used by volunteer firefighters United StatesLaws= A vehicle lawfully displaying courtesy lights is not an emergency response vehicle. In most states, vehicles displaying courtesy lights must still stop at stop signs, red lights, etc. and may not speed or disobey any traffic regulations. Usually, violation ticket fines are increased if the ticketed car was flashing courtesy lights. Laws vary greatly by state. In most states, other vehicles are not required to yield to the vehicle displaying the courtesy lights, hence the name \\"courtesy\\", although laws requiring permits for those using courtesy lights vary by state. In the state of New Jersey, for instance, users of a volunteer blue light must abide by all traffic laws including speed limit, stop signs, and red lights; however other non emergency drivers must pull over for a volunteer blue light.

Ohio is one if the few states that allows the use of sirens in conjunction with lights. Volunteer Firemen and EMTs in the state of Ohio may display red flashing lights and use traditional warning sirens in the same way that a traditional fire apparatus would so long as they pass an inspection by the Ohio State Highway Patrol. In Virginia any member of a fire department, volunteer fire company, or volunteer emergency medical services agency and any police chaplain may equip one vehicle owned by him with no more than two flashing or steady-burning red or red and white combination warning light units of types approved by the Superintendent of the State Police.https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-1024 =Colors= It depends on the state that you live in.

Gill was then sold to the Baltimore Orioles of the Double-A International League, where he hit 34 home runs and batted .325 that year. After hitting .344 with 23 homers in 1931, he was purchased by the Washington Senators in September and appeared in 8 games as they battled with the New York Yankees for second place in the American League.

The next season was his last one in the major leagues and his most extensive, as he played in 71 games for the Cubs, hitting .253 with 7 home runs and 28 RBIs. After the Cubs sold him to San Francisco Seals of the Double-A Pacific Coast League for the 1937 season, he returned to Chattanooga in 1938, playing for Baltimore again and his hometown Nashville Volunteers in 1938-39.

The 35-year-old woman had last been seen on July 31, 2012 re-entering her apartment in a house near Crotona Park in the Bronx, New York City. In 2014, New York City police had charged her building superintendent, Nasean Bonie, with her murder although there was no body. Bonie had been suspected of killing Moore from the beginning of the investigation into her disappearance. Her friends said that Moore had been having a dispute with him over her rent payments. On the night she was last seen, circumstantial evidence suggests he might have been disposing of a body. After a 2013 police search of the basement of Moore's apartment, Bonie filed a lawsuit alleging that the police stole money from him. He has since claimed he was charged with Moore's murder in retaliation. In 2014 Bonie was arrested in Pennsylvania by federal marshals. At the time, he reportedly claimed that the absence of a body precluded any murder charges against him. His trial, which would have been the first murder trial in the history of Bronx County without the decedent's body in evidence, was scheduled to begin in April 2015, days after Moore's body was found. Bonie's trial was postponed while medical examiners determined Moore's cause of death. At the time Moore disappeared, Bonie was facing assault charges for an attack on his wife that left her seriously injured. Shortly after Moore's body was discovered, Bonie was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison for the attack on his wife. The defense has obtained city records showing that Moore was up to date in her rent payments. Prosecutors clarified that the dispute was not about the rent but rather a scheme by Bonie to increase those payments by coercing Moore to file false documentation that would have boosted her Section 8 subsidies. To bolster this theory, in late 2015 they subpoenaed the unedited footage from an interview Bonie gave to a local cable channel that had closely covered the case. The cable channel has vigorously opposed giving up the footage to the police. It is appealing the judge's decision requiring them to let him review footage and release relevant portions to the police. A month-long trial in July 2016 ended with the jury acquitting Bonie of murder charges but convicting him of the lesser included charge of manslaughter. Background In the spring of 2012 the 35-year-old Moore, a Guyanese American, was living on Jefferson Place in the Bronx neighborhood of Claremont, two blocks south of Crotona Park. She lived in one of a row of attached single-family houses that qualified as Section 8 affordable housing. She rented the house from a couple, Krystal Campbell and Nasean Bonie. Although Campbell owned the houses, she delegated management responsibilities to her husband, the building superintendent. Both Moore and Bonie had been having legal difficulties at the time. Three of Moore's four children, who lived with her, had been removed from the house earlier in the year and placed in foster care by the city's Administration for Children's Services (ACS). They had investigated and confirmed reports that the children had been neglected, missing school and staying at home by themselves during some of Moore's frequent absences. Moore did not have a job but was hoping to have at least her eldest child, her daughter Rashina, move back in later in the summer after the mother completed court-mandated required programs. On July 12 of that year, Bonie beat his wife with a tray table, his belt and his fists, fracturing her skull in the process. He was arrested and charged with second-degree assault against Campbell, a felony. At the time, Moore told a neighbor that Bonie had been trying to extort money from her under the guise of rent. Disappearance Moore was outside her house talking with the neighbor to whom she had already complained about Bonie's extortion efforts on the evening of July 31, 2012. She had called 9-1-1 about Bonie twice that day. She had been eating a mango, and offered the neighbor one. After the neighbor accepted, Moore returned to her house to get the fruit. She never came out with the mango, and was never again seen alive by anyone who has publicly discussed witnessing these events, such as the neighbor in question. Moore was reported missing several days later, after her absence had continued longer than was typical of her. The neighbor later told police that shortly after Moore had re-entered the house, she had heard her arguing with Bonie, and that after a loud bang the argument had ended. Investigation New York City police detectives began their search by looking at Moore's apartment. Her departure seemed to have been abrupt and unplanned. Her cat had not been fed, nor any arrangements made for it. Prescription medication for the lupus she suffered from was left behind, and Moore had not gotten any more pills from the pharmacy. Despite the shortcomings that ACS found in her treatment of her children, Moore had never missed family events such as birthdays of her children. Bonie confirmed to police that he had an ongoing dispute with Moore over her rent. He said she had been a problematic tenant. \\"She seems to have a drug problem and she lets different men into her apartment at all hours of the night,\\" he told detectives. Soon after her disappearance, he threw out her remaining belongings and rented the house to a new tenant. The police investigation led to a series of tips from other neighbors on the street. One detective described them as \\"watchers\\" like the character played by Jimmy Stewart in the Alfred Hitchcock film Rear Window. They described a series of actions by Bonie. One neighbor recalled that shortly after Moore's neighbor told of last seeing her, he had seen Bonie leave the house carrying a large garbage container, and put it in a vehicle. Another saw him return in that same vehicle later that night. Police began to consider the case a murder investigation, although it was still officially a missing-persons case. A search of records related to Bonie's cell phone found a series of pings that night, as well as some calls from towers in Orange and Rockland counties, northwest of the city on the other side of the Hudson River. Bonie has relatives living there. One detective, Malcolm Reiman, worked with a ballistics expert to narrow a search area based on Bonie's known departure and arrival times at his house and an estimated rate of road travel speed. Within that area, they searched road embankments, primarily in Harriman State Park, a large wooded protected area that straddles the border between the two counties, but did not find Moore's body. Eventually, the investigation developed enough evidence for police to get a search warrant for the basement under the apartment occupied by Moore. They executed it in April 2013. The basement floor was covered in raw sewage. A dog was loose in the area which the officers had to subdue with a tranquilizer dart before they could search the premises. In a toilet they found half a bag of charcoal, which they believed had intentionally been flushed to cause the backup from the sewers and destroy trace evidence. \\"The feces might have rendered some forensic evidence irretrievable,\\" Reiman later told The New York Times. A camera crew from News 12, a cable news channel in the New York metropolitan area, accompanied the police to film the search operation for its broadcast. Bonie, who had not been present when officers arrived, was livid when he returned and found the search in progress. He claimed the police were harassing him, since he had already spoken to them and allowed them to search Moore's apartment several times. Later, he accused the police of stealing $40,000 in cash from the basement during the search, an allegation the department denied. A suit he filed over the allegedly missing money is pending. Arrest Police did not say whether the search of the basement had turned up anything significant. But almost a year later, in May 2014, Bronx County prosecutors presented the evidence against Bonie to a grand jury, which indicted him on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. An arrest warrant was issued for Bonie. The New York Post reported that an acquaintance had told police that Bonie had admitted to him that he had something to do with Moore's disappearance. By this time, Bonie had left New York and moved to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. He was taken into custody by federal marshals. \\"I watch 48 on television,\\" he told them, upon being informed that he was being arrested and charged with murdering Moore. \\"You can't charge me with murder without a body.\\" Back in the Bronx, a Supreme Court justice ordered Bonie held without bail. Since the early 19th century, American courts have tried over 400 murders in which the victim's body had not been found; Bonie's case would have been the first in the Bronx. \\"It's like running a 100-meter race when the criminal gets to start at the 20-meter mark,\\" a former federal prosecutor told the Times. \\"When you don't have a body, you don't have the best evidence in the crime.\\" But, prosecutors in Manhattan had gained convictions for con artists Sante and James Kimes in the 1998 murder of their landlady, Irene Silverman, without her body having been found. The prosecutor allowed conviction of Bonie was possible if other aspects of the case were strong. Late in 2014, News 12 aired an interview with Bonie, who had been held in jail since his arrest. He denied any involvement in Moore's disappearance or death, saying that she had been a good tenant who had paid her rent on time. If he had killed her, he asked, why would he have cooperated with the police investigation as much as he had, to the point of allowing officers to search his home without obtaining a search warrant? He said they had only considered him as a suspect after he filed suit for their allegedly taking money from the basement. Discovery of body alt=A road in a wooded area with another road going off to the right. There are tall trees and dense underbrush on the corner opposite. Telephone poles line the right side, and two cars are approaching in the distance. In April 2015, utility workers for Central Hudson Gas & Electric were clearing trees away from power lines along New York State Route 208 in South Blooming Grove, a small village in Orange County west of the Hudson River. At the wooded, undeveloped intersection with Captain Carpenter Road just north of the village's center, they came upon the skeletal remains of a human body about from the road. They called New York State Police. The remains were taken to the local medical examiner so that an autopsy could be performed. Four days later dental records matched the bones to Moore. Bonie was known to have a friend near where the remains were found. It was not known at that time whether Moore had been killed in the Bronx or Orange County. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges, denying any involvement in Moore's death. Trial Pretrial motions in Bonie's case were to have started the week following the body's discovery. Instead, the trial was continued so that a forensic anthropologist for the city could examine the bones to establish the cause of death. Police believe that Bonie strangled Moore but, without her body, could not be sure. The report was expected to be completed by June. The day after the body was identified as Moore, Bonie appeared in court to face the pending assault case against his wife. He pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to four years in prison, to be followed by three years of post-release supervision. Judge Ralph Fabrizio called his crime \\"a multi-weapon attack on a woman.\\" In September 2015 prosecutors issued a subpoena duces tecum to News 12, requesting that it turn over to them all the footage of reporter Ray Raimundi's jailhouse interview with Bonie. In response, News 12 wrote to Fabrizio saying that they would provide a copy of the broadcast interview, but not the unaired portions, citing state shield laws. The prosecution moved to have News 12 held in contempt of court, upon which the channel formally moved to quash the subpoena at the end of October. At the ensuing hearing on the subpoena and the motion to quash, News 12 argued that there was nothing in the unedited hearing that the state either did not know or was relevant to its case against Bonie. The prosecutors responded that they sought to determine if there was additional evidence to support their theory of Bonie's alleged financial motive to murder Moore. Around the time Moore's body was discovered, the defense had obtained records from the city's Housing Authority showing that Moore had paid all her rent on time, and casting doubt on the prosecution's theory of Bonie's motive as a rent dispute. The prosecution, which had attached to the indictment a report from a detective who spoke with Bonie three days after Moore's disappearance quoting Bonie as saying that she owed him rent and he was planning to have her evicted, said that their theory was not that she had failed to pay her rent, but that Bonie had been pressuring her to file false Section 8 paperwork so he could collect additional rent. They wanted to see if he had made any statements during the interview that either confirmed that theory or contradicted his earlier statements. Fabrizio ruled for the state that News 12 had to turn over the complete, unedited interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way for the state to find out what he might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue. The decision was stayed pending appeal, a step News 12 said it would take. \\"This is the classic case of overreach by a prosecutor who is attempting to use the work product of a reporter as an investigative tool for his criminal prosecution,\\" said David Schulz, an attorney for the channel. \\"This is precisely what the shield law prohibits.\\" In July 2016 Bonie's trial took place. The prosecution presented 20 witnesses over the month. At the end, the jury acquitted Bonie of murder but convicted him of manslaughter. The next month, Bonie was sentenced to the maximum, 25-years in prison. Bonie maintained his innocence as he read from a prepared statement before the sentencing. \\"My life, I believe, has been taken by the NYPD,\\" he told the court. \\"This is 2016 and black men are now target practice for police,\\" he said. \\"The Bronx District Attorney's office is no better ... They are out to cover their tracks of lies, deceit and prejudice.\\" Moore's sister, in response, called him a \\"menace to society ... [who] should never be able to see the light of day again.\\" He was returned to Attica Correctional Facility, where he had been serving his assault sentence.

The 'ndrina hailed from the Archi neighbourhood in Reggio Calabria. Several of its members were included in the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy. According to prosecutor Salvatore Boemi, the De Stefanos are the representation of the manager-criminal controlling a crime multinational with joint ventures with Raffaele Cutolo from the Camorra and Nitto Santapaola and Francesco Ferrera from Cosa Nostra in Catania. Origins The De Stefano brothers, Paolo, Giovanni, Giorgio and Orazio would come to prominence as members of the 'Ndrangheta clan of Domenico Tripodo, the old boss (capobastone) of Reggio Calabria, who had acquired considerable financial resources through tobacco smuggling. Within two years (as a result of the first 'Ndrangheta war in 1974-1976) they moved from being simple 'Ndranghetisti to being the new \\"lords\\" of Reggio Calabria.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 50-51 Before that time the clan had not been very prominent, according to the pentito Giacomo Lauro, who held important positions in the Reggio Calabria clans. \\"In 1970 ‚Ä¶ the De Stefanos ‚Ä¶ were nobody, they were nobody. The De Stefano brothers became the owners of Reggio Calabria after the war, the first mafia war. ‚Ä¶ I do not want to swear, but who the fuck were the De Stefanos in the 1970s? They had killed a certain Sergi for four oxen, for a fraud of four oxen in Modena ‚Ä¶ These were the De Stefanos. They committed petty fraud for four cows, ‚Ä¶ then with cigarettes.\\" Rise to power Tripodo was a traditional 'Ndrangheta boss who opposed to new developments in the organisation as well as the formation of the Santa, a secret society within the 'Ndrangheta established in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses. The members were eager to modify the traditional rules of the 'Ndrangheta in order to enter the public work market and start illegal activities such as drug trafficking, which were prohibited by the traditional code but promised to be very profitable.

Paolo De Stefano became a member of La Santa and the De Stefanos won a monopoly of construction work in northern Reggio Calabria, moving the rival Tripodo group out of the market of public work contracts with the support of the Piromalli and Mammoliti 'ndrine.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 156 They also robbed a shipment of smuggled tobacco belonging to Tripodo. First 'Ndrangheta war These innovations and the institution of La Santa were opposed by the more traditionalist chiefs like Tripodo and Antonio Macr√¨. Only at the end of the so-called First 'Ndrangheta war, which took place in 1974-76 and led to the deaths of Macr√¨ and Tripodo as well as the rise of the Piromalli 'ndrina and the De Stefano brothers as the new leaders of the Reggio Calabria 'ndrine, was the new institution fully recognized. The war started with an attack on the brothers Giorgio, Paolo and Giovanni De Stefano in the Roof Garden bar in Reggio Calabria in November 1974 ordered by Tripodo. Giovanni was killed while the eldest of the brothers ‚Äì and the boss of the clan ‚Äì Giorgio was wounded. 'Ndrangheta: De Stefano, una cosca sempre in primo piano, ANSA, February 24, 2004 Tripodo was arrested in February 1975 and incarcerated in the Poggioreale prison in Naples. He was killed with the help of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) who worked with the De Stefano‚Äôs in drug trafficking.

The so-called Golpe Borghese fizzled out in the night of December 8, 1970, however. The De Stefanos entered in a Masonic lodge in order to better take care of business and political interests. The lawyer Giorgio De Stefano, a cousin of the boss Paolo, was elected for the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana) in the city council of Reggio Calabria for many years, and Paolo Romeo, a member of Parliament for the Italian Social Democratic Party (Partito Socialista Democratico Italiano, PSDI) for several legislatures.Paoli, Organised crime in Italy, p. 290 They were also close to Lodovico Ligato, a Christian Democrat politician from Reggio Calabria and the former head of the Italian State Railways. He was killed by rival 'Ndrangheta groups in August 1989 in a dispute about bribes over public contracts. Business interests When in 1974 businesses involved in the expansion of the port and steelworks in Gioia Tauro offered a three per cent kickback to be left in peace the three leading 'Ndrangheta families at the time, Antonio Macr√¨, the Piromalli brothers and the De Stefano brothers rejected the offer and wanted to be sub-contracted on work carried in order to control the project.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 106Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 168 The 'Ndrangheta exploited the construction of the steelworks until the project was abandoned when the government decided there was no economic base for it. In 1977 disagreements about business interests emerged between Piromalli and the De Stefano clan. A hit squad headed by Giuseppe \\"Peppe\\" Piromalli killed Giorgio De Stefano. Some 1,000 people were killed in clan wars over the construction contracts.Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 188 Paolo took over the leadership of the clan. In the 1980s, the De Stefano brothers controlled virtually the entire wholesale meat market of Reggio Calabria. They forced butchers and supermarkets, through intimidation and threats, to buy meat from their companies.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 253 Second 'Ndrangheta war A second 'Ndrangheta war was triggered by the marriage between Giuseppina Condello ‚Äì the sister of the Condello brothers, underbosses of De Stefano ‚Äì and Antonio Imerti, the leader of a neighbouring 'ndrina in Villa San Giovanni. The conflict exploded in 1985, two years after the marriage and saw practically all the 'ndrine in the city of Reggio Calabria grouped into either one of two opposing factions. De Stefano had become fearful of the new alliance that might challenge his power base. A failed attempt on Antonio Imerti triggered the murder of Paolo De Stefano on October 13, 1985.

The resulting clash with the Piromalli 'ndrina, whose monopoly this was, half destroyed the De Stefano cosca and left the clan leader, Paolo De Stefano, dead.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 157 Succession Paolo‚Äôs brother Orazio De Stefano and his cousin, the lawyer Giorgio De Stefano, took over the leadership of the clan.

Boll was, somewhat unintentionally, one of the key players in the DFL Party's \\"firestorm\\" that swept through southwestern Minnesota in the mid-1980s at the height of the Midwestern Farm Crisis. The party's onslaught led to an unprecedented take-over of nearly all the legislative seats in southwestern Minnesota in the 1986 elections.http://www.dglobe.com/ Archive-4/20/93 Dubbed the DFL's \\"hatchet man\\" by Minnesota Republicans,http://www.dglobe.com/ Archive-2/10/1986 (Erickson-Menning) Boll actively engaged the media to hammer away at the Republicans over what he maintained were their failed policies in rural America, using the farm crisis as the basis for his attacks. He also supported the somewhat militant Groundswell movement in its quest to bring political and social change on behalf of the region's farmers. Utilizing a steady stream of scathing editorials and letters-to-the-editor in over thirty area newspapers, he made the case for change over the course of five election cycles, helping the DFL experience unprecedented success in the traditionally Republican small towns and rural communities of the region.http://www.dglobe.com/ Archive-12/83-4/93 Youth and early activism in Southern Minnesota According to some who knew him, Boll had a bit of a \\"bad boy\\" reputation early on‚Äîa reputation he later channeled successfully into brash, no-nonsense political change. Growing up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, his conservative religious background and schooling at a Lutheran college in New Ulm served as the contrasting catalyst for the more liberal views he displayed once he became active in the Democratic Party. While in college, Boll worked with Rudy Perpich's 1982 gubernatorial campaign and with Mark Dayton's bid for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Senator Dave Durenberger. Briefly managing a state senate campaign in the New Ulm area for former New Ulm mayor and state representative Tony Eckstein, he later moved to Worthington, where he worked as administrator and later chief of a security agency and became active in the community as a church youth leader and a member of several local boards. He quickly gained the attention of area Democrats through his editorials in the region's newspapers. Implementing the DFL \\"Firestorm\\" of 1986 Touted as bringing a younger voice to the DFL, Boll quickly rose through the ranks to become a party leader and \\"whiz kid\\" of sorts. In 1985 he was named to fill a vacancy as party secretary for the old 2nd Congressional District, a sprawling 31-county area. He was subsequently elected to the position four times. In that role, he helped promote candidates for the congressional seat held by Republican Vin Weber‚Äîamong them Dave Johnson, Todd Lundquist and, later, David Minge. The following year he was asked by the Minnesota House and Senate DFL caucuses to be their point man for finding and recruiting candidates to run for the various legislative seats in the area. For his own legislative district, Boll quickly allied with Jim Vickerman, a Murray County commissioner and farmer, whom he pushed to run for the state senate in District 28 (which became District 22 after the 1992 legislative redistricting) against incumbent Senator Doran Isackson. At the time, the large district included all or portions of Brown, Cottonwood, Jackson, Martin, Murray, Nobles, Redwood and Watonwan counties. Taking on the role of manager of the campaign, he proceeded to carve out a detailed strategy and format that quickly became a model for other legislative campaign structures in Greater Minnesota. Boll's campaign management style was similar to his personal approach in taking on the Republicans, relying significantly on an all-out \\"blitz\\" that consisted of constant visibility and development of name recognition in the news media, on the radio, in signage, in literature and in billboards through \\"branding\\" of the Vickerman name. He also implemented multiple literature drops to and door-knocking of every home in the district, and generated a steady flow of press releases on issues relevant to local residents that were distributed to area media outlets. Multiple fundraisers, or \\"bean feeds,\\" as they were often called, were held in each county in the district, as were driving tours during which the candidate would randomly stop in the \\"Main Street\\" cafes and downtown businesses of the various communities around the district to visit with residents. The campaign also actively linked with other DFL campaigns to promote a unified wall of new voices for the region. The strategy worked in spades, with DFL candidates, including Vickerman, solidly trouncing their opponents in nearly every legislative district in southwestern Minnesota in what came to be called the DFL \\"firestorm\\" of 1986.http://www.startribune.com/ Archive-11/6/86 Okabena Towers incident A recollection of the 1986 campaigns in southwestern Minnesota merits comment on a bizarre incident that took place the evening before election day. Wrapping up the campaign on November 3, Boll, Jim Vickerman and several campaign workers hung literature for DFL candidates on the doors of the residents of the Okabena Towers, a high rise housing complex for seniors in Worthington. After finishing the top floors of the building, one of the campaign workers walked back through one of the lower floors and noticed that all the DFL literature was missing from the doors and, in their place, were brochures for Senator Doran Isackson, Vickerman's opponent. The worker found Boll, Vickerman and the manager of the building and advised them. They walked back through the upper floors and came upon Isackson removing the DFL literature from the doors, putting it in a folder and replacing it with his own. Boll approached and confronted Isackson, who then ran down one of the side stairwells of the building, with Boll and others in pursuit. When he reached the main floor, Isackson exited the building, ran toward and got into his vehicle. Boll ran to the driver's side of the vehicle and asked Isackson to roll down the window so he could speak with him. Isackson locked the doors, started the vehicle and rapidly drove it in reverse down the street. In the meantime, the building manager contacted the local police. Isackson was stopped for speeding on the way out of town, but the officer, unaware of the call in to the police at that point, warned and released him. An officer came to the Okabena Towers, took statements from Boll, Vickerman, the campaign workers and the building manager. Isackson was subsequently contacted by the police at his home in Storden and advised that the matter would be turned over to the local prosecutor. In the meantime, Vickerman requested that the matter be kept quiet until after the election so as not to be a factor in the outcome. News of the occurrence soon broke in the media and drew attention throughout the state.http://www.startribune.com/ Archive-11/8/86http://www.argusleader.com/ Archive-11/7/86 Isackson was subsequently charged with theft, but the prosecutor agreed to dismiss the charges provided he would write an apology letter to area residents, to be printed in newspapers throughout the district. Once printed, Isackson's letter proved to be a rambling diatribe that expressed his sense of frustration and feeling of being overwhelmed by the intensity of the campaign that Boll, Vickerman and other Democrats had waged against him, stating that, no matter where he turned, all he heard or read about was how bad his voting record was, and how he had failed the district as a senator.http://www.dglobe.com/ Archive-11/15/1986 This sentiment was echoed, albeit less openly, by other defeated Republicans in the region. Party leadership In 1987, Boll ran for party chair of the legislative district, facing opposition from area farmer and political activist Andrew Olson, a staunch supporter of the somewhat radical activist Lyndon LaRouche, founder of the LaRouche movement. Boll won the race handily and was subsequently re-elected to the post three times. He also became active at the state level as a member of the Minnesota DFL's central and executive committees. In 1988, Boll allied early on with U.S. Senator Paul Simon in his bid for the presidency, serving as state coordinator for the campaign and arranging for visits by the senator to Minnesota and South Dakota, including a stop in Boll's home town of Worthington. He also made the rounds on Simon's behalf, appearing on TV stations in Sioux Falls and Omaha. When Simon later withdrew from the race as Massachusetts' governor Michael Dukakis took the forefront, he set his sights on other goals, serving several years on the Minnesota Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights,Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution to which he was appointed by Governor Perpich, and on the Minnesota General Crime Advisory Council, to which he was appointed by Corrections Commissioner Orville Pung. Boll ran for party secretary of the Minnesota DFL in 1989, but was defeated by party activist Rick Stafford, who went on to become the state party chair just two years later. Boll's pro-life stance on abortion, his support of capital punishment, and his opposition to the more liberal ideology of Twin Cities' Democrats rankled urban party leaders and ensured his defeat. Move to the Twin Cities and post-activism In 1993, Boll moved to the Twin Cities to continue his work with a real estate and property management company that specialized in student and market rate housing. He briefly served as a party officer for the 4th Congressional District DFL, which encompasses Saint Paul and the surrounding suburbs. Having previously supported former U.S. Attorney Tom Berg in his bid for the DFL's endorsement for the U.S. Senate against Paul Wellstone, Boll again allied with Berg in his bid for the party's endorsement for the U.S. Senate against Ann Wynia in 1994, and was named 2nd Congressional District Coordinator for the campaign. When Berg withdrew from the race after Wynia won the endorsement, he laid low and never endorsed Wynia. He turned his energies briefly to involvement with several Minneapolis organizations that promoted social change and helped homeless and troubled inner city youth. Health problems plagued Boll in the mid 1990s, culminating in his hospitalization for several weeks in 1997. While he subsequently recovered, he abruptly disappeared from the Minnesota political scene around that time and has not been involved since. He is believed to still live in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.

Several employees who have won small claims suits over wage theft remain unpaid. Bellum also owes numerous companies unpaid money and as a result has been blacklisted from various distributors from consideration of production deals. It owes one company, Launchpad Entertainment, LLC over $275,000 in unpaid footage license fees that it used in programs. A legal notice published in the July 19, 2019 issue of The Hollywood Reporter indicates Bellum's library assets will be publicly auctioned by The Credit Junction (acting as the secured party) beginning July 22, 2019, before the actual auction occurs on August 15 at the office of a Santa Monica attorney. The auction would have been called off if Bellum secured their library for a payment of $10 million; it is unknown if they were able to do so.

Piron entered the Belgian Army and served during World War I as both a junior infantry officer and, briefly, in the Belgian Air Force. He rose through the ranks during the interwar period and held the rank of major at the time of the German invasion of Belgium in World WarII. He subsequently escaped from German-occupied Belgium and reached the United Kingdom, where he led a re-organisation of the Free Belgian military. Promoted to the head of the 1stBelgian Infantry Brigade, he led the unit from 1942 to 1944, including on the Western Front in late 1944. He commanded the Belgian army of occupation in Germany in 1946‚Äì1947 and was aide de camp to Prince-Regent Charles and, later, to King Baudouin. He ended his career as lieutenant general and retired in 1957. He died in 1974. Early career Piron was born in Couvin in Belgium's Province of Namur on 10April 1896. He entered the Royal Military Academy in Brussels at the age of 17 in 1913. Following the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914 at the start of World War I, Piron, who had not finished his studies, was mobilised into the Belgian Army as a junior officer in the . He served with the Belgian army on the Yser Front and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1916. After being hospitalised with appendicitis in October 1917, he was transferred to the Belgian Air Force and served as an air observer with the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron. He was wounded twice. At the end of the war in 1918, Piron held the rank of acting captain. During the interwar period, Piron returned to his studies at the academy. He remained in the Belgian Army, serving in the headquarters of the 2ndArmy Corps and later in the 1st Grenadier Regiment. Rising through the ranks to major, he served with the and later at the headquarters of the 5th Army Corps at the outbreak of the Phoney War. World War II During World War II, Piron served during the German invasion of Belgium (10‚Äì28May 1940), after which the Belgian Army surrendered and Belgium was placed under military occupation. Piron, however, refused to accept the Belgian surrender and succeeded in escaping from occupied Belgium via France and Spain to British Gibraltar. He arrived in Scotland in February 1942. T17 Staghound armoured car with the markings of the Piron Brigade The Belgian government in exile began to form a Free Belgian army in late 1940 among Belgian soldiers and expatriates who had succeeded in reaching the United Kingdom. Following his arrival in Britain, Piron was tasked with reforming the Belgian and Luxembourgish forces into an infantry battalion, an artillery battery, and an armoured squadron. The move followed a period of unrest among the Belgian troops which had culminated in a minor mutiny on 14 November, caused by inactivity and political infighting. The reaction by the incumbent commander, Colonel Lecomte, had been considered inadequate by the Belgian government. Piron, designated as Lecomte's successor, took command in December 1942 and became commander of the resulting unit, the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, on its formation in January 1943. The unit, numbering between 1,800 and 2,200 men, was soon popularly nicknamed the \\"Piron Brigade\\" (Brigade Piron) after him. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1944. His style of command earned him the nickname \\"the pasha\\" or \\"the lion\\". According to Luc DeVos, a historian, \\"it was [...] indisputably Piron who played the major role in transforming the unit into a well-oiled military machine\\". The Brigade Piron was deployed to France in August 1944 following the Normandy Landings. Although it was kept in reserve for most of the campaign, the unit was deployed in combat in Normandy alongside the British 6th Airborne Division and, later, the Guards Armoured Division. Among other operations, the unit liberated the French town of Honfleur on 25 August. It was also involved in the Liberation of Belgium in September 1944 and entered Brussels on 4September, the day after the arrival of the first British troops. The brigade was then moved to Dutch Limburg, where it participated in heavy fighting until November. After the Liberation, Piron became aide de camp to Charles, Count of Flanders, who became prince regent in 1944 and commander of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Piron was promoted to the rank of major general in December 1945. Post-war career While still serving as aide to the prince regent, Piron was promoted to command the Belgian army of occupation in Allied-controlled Germany in March 1946. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in December 1947. Piron enjoyed the role but was dismissed in 1951 after falling out with the Belgian Minister of Defence Eug√®ne De Greef. He was transferred to head the Belgian Army's general staff, but Piron resented the move. He became aide to the prince regent's successor, King Baudouin, in 1951. In 1954 he was given a post as president of the Superior Council of the Armed Forces (Conseil sup√©rieur des Forces arm√©es, or CSFA) but still resented being transferred from the army in Germany. Piron finally retired from the military in 1957. He published a memoir in 1969. He died of a heart attack in his home in Uccle, a suburb of Brussels, on the morning of 4September 1974 after participating in the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Brussels' Liberation.

Thomas' first comprehensive survey Hank Willis Thomas: All Things Being Equal‚Ä¶ opened at the Portland Art Museum in fall 2019 and will travel to additional U.S. museums in 2020. The exhibition will highlight Thomas' devotion to reframing perspectives on difficult issues central to American history and the representation of race and the politics of visual culture.https://portlandartmuseum.org/hank-willis-thomas-all-things-being- equal-receives-nea-grant/ = Collaborative projects = For Freedoms  Founded in 2016 along with artist Eric Gottesman, For Freedoms is an anti-partisan platform for creative civic engagement, discourse, and direct action. The name was inspired by American artist Norman Rockwell's paintings of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms (1941)‚Äî freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Through exhibitions, installations, and public programs, the organization is established to deepen public discussions on civic issues and core values, and to advocate for equality, dialogue, and civic participation. In 2018, For Freedoms launched the 50 State Initiative, the largest creative collaboration in U.S. history. In the fall of 2018, For Freedoms launched a major billboard campaign in every state, including Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. The campaign included over 150 contemporary artists, including Marilyn Minter, Rashid Johnson, Guerrilla Girls, and Theaster Gates, among others. In October 2018, For Freedoms also launched a photo campaign entitled Four Freedoms. In collaboration with photographers Emily Shur and Wyatt Gallery, Thomas and For Freedoms transformed Norman Rockwell's depictions of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1941 address to Congress, which articulated FDR‚Äôs vision of the four basic human freedoms. Thomas wrote that \\"The image haunted me because of the world we live in. I wanted to imagine what it would look like today.\\" Through dozens of iterations of Rockwell‚Äôs original four paintings, the 82 images in the campaign attempted to reflect the immeasurable diversity of American identities today. Celebrities such as Rosario Dawson, Dolores Huerta, Gina Belafonte, Van Jones, Jesse Williams, Robert A. Nakamura and Karen L. Ishizuka, Kiran Gandhi, Michael Ealy, Saul Williams, Rodney Barnette, and others were included in the reinterpretations. The new version of the images were widely shared on social media and Instagram, including by celebrities such as Alicia Keys and Jada Pinkett-Smith.https://news.artnet.com/art- world/for-freedoms-rockwell-1384654  The Writing On The Wall  Together with American academic, cultural critic and activist Baz Dreisinger, Thomas and Dreisinger's organization, Incarceration Nations Network, have collaborated to create the traveling exhibition and installation, The Writing On The Wall (TWOTW), constructed from over 2,000 pages of writing and art by incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people across the world. TWOTW was first displayed on New York City's High Line in November, 2019, and throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic the collaborators have adapted the content to be projected onto city buildings and landscapes, including jails and courthouses ‚Äì first in New York, then in Washington D.C. and Ohio. The installation's first international showing was in Mexico City in late June.  Cause Collective  The Cause Collective is a team of artists, designers and ethnographers creating innovative art in the public realm. Their projects explore and enliven public spaces by creating a dynamic conversation between issues, sites and the public audience. By exploring ideas that affect and shape society, the collective seeks to add the \\"public\\" back into public space and art. = The Long March = The Long March is a 27 monitor installation commissioned by the recently renovated Birmingham Shuttlesworth International Airport. The installation incorporates depictions of movement, migration and marching from different eras in Alabama history, for instance, the Civil War, the Children‚Äôs March, the Selma Marches, football marching bands, the railroad, and migrations to the ‚ÄúMagic City.‚Äù The long row of monitors (the long march) track to the center of the wall and meld into a kaleidoscope. The kaleidoscope is tiled in the shape of a Camellia ‚Äì the Alabama state flower. The Camellia, in this instance, is a repository of past and present motion that represents the flowering that grows out of movement. The kaleidoscopic mixes and melds the long march footage creating new emergent patterns, forms and colors. The travelers who will encounter the piece will be able to envision themselves as part of this mosaic that is symbolized through Alabama‚Äôs relationship to ‚Äòthe march‚Äô as a form of historical progression. = In Search of the Truth (The Truth Booth) = Thomas is working on the long-term and global public art project In Search of the Truth (The Truth Booth). Also known as \\"The Truth Booth\\" it is in collaboration with Ryan Alexiev, Jim Ricks, and Will Sylvester, all members of Cause Collective, a team of artists, designers, and ethnographers creating innovative art in the public realm.http://www.causecollective.com/projects/httpwww- insearchofthetruth-net/http://insearchofthetruth.net/ The New York Times writes: \\"The ‚ÄúTruth Booth,‚Äù [is] a roving, inflatable creation by a group of artists calling itself the Cause Collective. The booth, in the shape of a cartoon word bubble with ‚ÄúTRUTH‚Äù in bold letters on its side, serves as a video confessional. Visitors are asked to sit inside and finish the politically and metaphysically loaded sentence that begins, ‚ÄúThe truth is ‚Ä¶‚Äù\\".Randy Kennedy. Political Art in a Fractious Election Year \\"The New York Times\\", July 17, 2016 To date, the project has travelled Ireland, Afghanistan, South Africa, Australia, the United States, and Mexico. It embarked on a world tour at the Galway Arts Festival, Ireland in 2011. It debuted in the US during the LOOK3 Festival of the Photograph in Charlottesville, VA in June 2012. Throughout this long-term project the video footage is compiled and edited into a video artwork. To expand and engage with audiences, the movements of \\"The Truth Booth\\" and sample responses are tracked, edited, and categorized on a website. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to try to capture as many definitions, confessions and thoughts on The Truth as possible, creating a diverse ‚Äòportrait‚Äô of people across the globe. It was first supported by the Arts Council of Ireland, and the San Francisco Foundation. = Question Bridge: Black Males = In collaboration with artists Chris Johnson, Bayet√© Ross Smith and Kamal Sinclair, Question Bridge: Black Males is a platform for black men of all ages and backgrounds to ask and candidly respond to questions that are rarely discussed in public. Through video mediated question and answer exchange, diverse members of this ‚Äúdemographic‚Äù bridge economic, political, geographic, and generational divisions. The Question Bridge campaign seeks to represent and redefine Black male identity in America. Additional collaborators include Jesse Williams, Delroy Lindo, and Dr. Deborah Willis. = Controversy = In 2018, Thomas was accused of plagiarism by South African photographer Graeme Williams.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/13/graeme-williams- hank-willis-thomas-photograph A photograph that Williams took in 1990 of black children in the foreground and white policemen in the background was modified by Thomas, removing colour from the background. The photograph was exhibited at the Johannesburg Art Fair, with an asking price of USD36000, without attribution or mention of Williams. Thomas defended himself saying that what he had done was \\"akin to sampling, remixing\\". In a separate case, South African photographer, Peter Magubane, who has photo-documented life in South Africa for six decades, discovered that Thomas had also altered one of his photos, similarly putting \\"a white fade over the background\\", without seeking permission from Magubane. Thomas defended his actions, saying that asking permission to use the photograph was a form of censorship. Magubane responded that Thomas' actions was arrogant, shameful and disrespectful.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/artist-hank-willis-thomas-accused- of-stealing-from-south-african-photographers-peter-magubane-graeme- williams/https://www.thesouthafrican.com/hank-willis-thomas-south-african- photos-appropriation/  Awards  2018 * Guggenheim Fellowship, John Simon Guggenheim Foundation * Art For Justice Fund Grant, Ford Foundation 2017 * Soros Equality Fellowship, Open Society Foundations * AIMIA  AGO Photography Prize * Infinity Award: New Media and Online Platform, International Center of Photography 2015 * Infinity Award: New Media, International Center of Photography 2007 * Artadia Award Permanent installation *Unity, Public sculpture, Brooklyn, NY. 2019. *Raise Up, Permanent Installation, Equal Justice Initiative's National Memorial for Peace and Justice, Montgomery, AL.

Thomas's work focuses on framing and context. He explores ideas about how history and culture are framed, who does the framing, and how this affects our interpretation of reality. In his work he focuses on speaking about popular culture and does so by using a variety of different mediums. He specifically likes to use photography because of the way you can edit a photograph, which can be a way of retelling history. Bibliography * Willis, Deborah, Hank Willis Thomas, and Kalia Brooks.

On July 21, 1950, Santobello and Joseph Corbo murdered Alfred Loreto, an off-duty New York Police Department officer, during an attempted kidnapping of Ralph Sgueglia, a butcher arriving home after work, in the Bronx section of New York. Apprehended at the crime scene, Santobello later testified that police brought him to the police station and interrogated him all night. Santobello also claimed that police hit him on the head with their guns and dazed him with a blow on the nose with a billy club. In June 1951, Santobello was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1966, a U.S. Supreme Court decision on illegal searches by police resulted in Santobello's sentence being reversed and his release from prison. In 1968, detective and whistleblower Frank Serpico arrested Santobello in the South Bronx for numbers running. Santobello was later sentenced to one year in prison, but was freed early due to another court decision on plea bargains. In later years, Santobello supervised a crew from his headquarters at \\"Club Arthur's', a social club on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. From 1991 on, Santobello was heavily involved in loansharking, illegal gambling in the form of craps games, bookmaking, and numbers running. On October 24, 1994, Santobello was convicted on ten counts of gambling and was sentenced on March 27, 1995 to 78 months in prison. Relaxed and joking during the trial, Santorello pleaded with the judge for leniency at the sentencing hearing, citing his family ties: > This has been a very delicate situation for me. After getting married, > having a daughter, I don't think I would be so foolish to subject myself to > going back to prison at this stage of my life. I've done my best to bring my > daughter up in the right manner. Santobello also claimed that the police had a vendetta against him because of his reversed 1950 murder conviction. On June 12, 2000, Santobello was released from federal prison. In May 2013, Santobello died of natural causes.Rudy Santobello, Wiseguy Who Wised Up Serpico To Mob-NYPD Ties, Dead At 84 by Jerry Capeci (May 23, 2013) GanglandNews In popular culture The 1973 Sidney Lumet film Serpico dramatized the Santobello arrest.

The Black Pearls) was a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band, notable as one of the pioneers of the former Yugoslav rock scene.  History  1963‚Äì80 = The band was formed in 1963 in Belgrade, and was named after Toma Janiƒá's film Crni biseri (Black Pearls) which dealt with juvenile delinquency. The band consisted of Goran Vukiƒáeviƒá (acoustic guitar, keyboards, accordion and harmonica), Dragan \\"Krcko\\" Jovanoviƒá (drums) and Bo≈æoviƒá brothers, Ivan (guitar) and Slavko (saxophone). In the beginning, the band performed without a bass guitarist, but were soon joined by the bassist and singer Vladimir Jankoviƒá, also known as \\"Vlada D≈æet\\", who got his nickname (\\"D≈æet\\" being a transliteration for Jet) after The Shadows bass guitarist Jet Harris. The band was soon joined by the singer Radan Valƒçiƒá. This lineup of the band performed until the Autumn of 1965, when they moved to rhythm and blues and started performing in the following lineup: Goran Vukiƒáeviƒá (guitar), Vlada D≈æet (bass guitar, vocals), Zoran Petkoviƒá (rhythm guitar), Radan Valƒçiƒá (vocals) and Dragan \\"Krcko\\" Jovanoviƒá (drums). Crni Biseri released their debut EP in April 1966, featuring Vlada D≈æet's song \\"Ne odlazi\\", which was the result of the band's desire to be one of the first former Yugoslav bands to record their own songs instead of cover versions. The B-side featured a cover of Manfred Mann's \\"Pretty Flamingo\\", with lyrics in Serbian language entitled \\"Lepi flamingo\\". The band won the first place on second Gitarijada festival held at the Belgrade Sajmi≈°te (not to be confused with Gitarijada festival held in Zajeƒçar). At the time Jovanoviƒá left the band and was replaced by Jovan \\"Kiƒáa\\" Ljubisavljeviƒá (later a Vlada D≈æet Band member). In 1968, Valƒçiƒá left the band and was replaced by a former Duka & ƒåavke frontman Nenad Dukiƒá. Dukiƒá was a band member for only three months, and provided vocals for three cover songs released on the band's second EP (the fourth song, \\"Nisam vi≈°e taj\\" was previously recorded with Valƒçiƒá). After Dukiƒá's departure, Valƒçiƒá returned to the band and remained the band's frontman until 1970, when he was replaced by the former Juniori vocalist Dragan Baletiƒá. During 1973, the band made a break in their work due to D≈æet's and Baletiƒá's army obligations. After Vlada D≈æet's and Baletiƒá's return from the army, the band continued their activity without Petkoviƒá. For a certain time the keyboardist Dragan Batalo performed with the band, but was soon replaced by the keyboardist and singer Dragan Rajiƒçeviƒá (a former Juniori member). In October 1976, Ljubisavljeviƒá left the band due to his army obligations and was replaced by a former Plavi Deƒçaci, Duka & ƒåavke, D≈æentlmeni, YU grupa, Opus and Dah member Velibor \\"Boka\\" Bogdanoviƒá. Having released their only full-length studio album, Motorok, and the single \\"Ti si uvek htela sve\\", Dragan Baletiƒá left the band and was replaced by a former Op Cup member Branislav \\"Cile\\" ≈Ωivanƒçeviƒá. In 1977. the band recorded a single featuring the songs \\"Hush Hush Maria\\" and \\"Night in Casablanca\\" under the name Denis. Three years later, on 1 January 1980, Crni Biseri officially disbanded. = Reunion = In 1997, the band reunited with vocalists Dragan Baletiƒá and Branislav ≈Ωivanƒçeviƒá to perform in the club Crna Maca in Zemun. The following year, the compilation album Crni Biseri was released, featuring previously unreleased songs \\"Mesto pod suncem\\", which is the band's first studio recording, \\"Moja draga\\", \\"Kamena vizija\\", \\"Hey girl\\". = Theatre and film activities = Crni Biseri appeared in ≈Ωika Pavloviƒá's film Kad budem mrtav i beo and in Stole Jankoviƒá's film The Girl in the Park. They wrote songs for the plays of the Belgrade Drama Theatre.  Legacy  Crni Biseri song \\"D≈æudi, D≈æudi\\" was covered by Yugoslav and Serbian folk rock band Garavi Sokak in 1991.

The coal-fired power plant, located across the Clinch River from the city of Kingston, used a series of ponds to store and dewater the fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion. The spill released a slurry of fly ash and water, which traveled across the Emory River and its Swan Pond embayment, onto the opposite shore, covering up to of the surrounding land. The spill damaged multiple homes and flowed into nearby waterways including the Emory River and Clinch River, both tributaries of the Tennessee River. It was the largest industrial spill in United States history. The initial spill, which resulted in millions of dollars worth of property damages and rendered many properties uninhabitable, cost TVA more than $1 billion to cleanup, and was declared complete in 2015. TVA was found liable for the spill in August 2012 by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The initial spill resulted in no injuries or deaths, but several of the employees of an engineering firm hired by TVA to clean up the spill developed illnesses, including brain cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, as a result of exposure to the toxic coal ash, and by the ten year anniversary of the spill, more than 30 had died. In November 2018, a federal jury ruled that the contractor did not properly inform the workers about the dangers of exposure to coal ash and had failed to provide them with necessary personal protective equipment. Background Original design of the ash disposal area The Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River. Watts Bar Dam, located along the Tennessee downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a stretch of the Tennessee (to Fort Loudoun Dam), the lower of the Clinch (to Melton Hill Dam), and the lower of the Emory. The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, began operations in 1954, primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby Oak Ridge. The plant contains nine units with a combined generating capacity of 1,398 megawatts, and burns about of coal every day. It was the largest coal- fired power plant in the world when it was completed. The plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the Emory River shore, and was subdivided into three separate sections, the main ash pond, stilling pond, and dewatering pond, each for the different steps of the disposal process. The entire ash pond was impounded by a dike that rose above the winter level and above sea level. Fly ash is the fine particulate matter produced by the combustion of coal, which is collected rather than allowing it to escape into the atmosphere. Once this is complete in the wet disposal method, it is mixed with water and pumped into a retaining pond, known as the main ash pond at the Kingston Plant, where the ash gradually settled to the bottom. Once the particulate matter settled out, the water was pumped to the stilling pond, where the remaining solids settled, and the ash was dredged and moved to drying cells in the unlined above-ground dewatering pond, also known as the solid waste containment pond, where the spill took place. At the time of the spill, the dredge cells contained a watery slurry of fly ash generated by the burning of finely ground coal at the power plant. TVA had reportedly known about the dangers of using wet storage ponds for coal ash since a 1969 spill in Virginia in which coal ash seeped into the Clinch River and killed large numbers of fish. TVA officials were also confirmed to have been aware of the toxicity of coal ash as early as 1981. In the 1980s, TVA engineers raised concerns about the stability of ash ponds. The utility repeatedly found leaks in levees and seepage in the soil at many of their ash ponds, including the ones at Kingston. However, TVA continued to make small repairs instead of switch to dry storage systems in an effort to reduce costs. At the time of the disaster, TVA was using wet storage at six of their 11 coal-fired power plants. Leaks at the Kingston ash ponds had reportedly been taking place since the early 1980s, and local residents said that the spill was not a unique occurrence. The 1960s-era pond had been observed leaking and being repaired nearly every year since 2001. The two worst leaks occurred in 2003 and 2006 in which TVA suspended all ash deposits in the ponds to allow the dredge cells to dry out and stabilize. An October 2008 inspection report had identified a small leak in the faulty wall, but the report was not yet complete at the time of the spill. EventDike breach and spill= A collapsed house inundated by the spill. The spill began sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 22, 2008 when the dike surrounding the ash containment dewatering pond broke. The breach occurred at the northwest corner of the dewatering pond, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway. The spill consisted of an initial large wave which lasted for approximately one minute, followed by a series of smaller consecutive waves of breaking away and sliding that occurred over a period of approximately one hour. TVA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially estimated that the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m¬≥) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million cubic yards (4 million m¬≥) on December 25, 2008. =Effects= The spill covered surrounding land with up to six feet (1.8 m) of sludge. Although the land surrounding the power plant is largely rural rather than residential, the spill caused a mudflow wave of water and ash that covered 12 homes, pushing one entirely off its foundation, rendering three uninhabitable, and caused some damage to 42 residential properties. It also washed out a road, ruptured a major gas line, obstructed a rail line, preventing a train delivering coal from reaching the plant, downed trees, broke a water main, and destroyed power lines. Though 22 residences were evacuated, nobody was reported to be injured or in need of hospitalization. It was the largest industrial spill in United States history, more than three times the size of the Martin County sludge spill of 2000, which spilled of liquid coal waste. The of sludge were enough to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools, and the volume released was about 100 times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and about 10 times greater than the volume released in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the largest oil spill in history. On December 23, 2008, a TVA spokesman, Gil Francis Jr., stated that, at the time of the spill, the area contained about 2.6 million cubic yards (2.2 million m¬≥) of ash, and that two-thirds of that had been released, which would later be found to cover an area of . The New York Times noted that the amount spilled was larger than the amount stated to have been in the pond before the spill, a discrepancy the TVA was unable to explain. The spill did not affect the adjacent retaining and stilling ponds; the other two stayed intact, while only the retaining wall for the solid waste containment area was affected. The confluence of the Clinch and Emory Rivers, with the Kingston Fossil Plant in the distance, five days after the spill. The white foam floating on the water consists of cenospheres, which are a component of the ash. The spill was reported to have killed and buried multiple deer and at least one dog, and ejected fish from the Emory River onto the river bank as far as from the shore. The contamination effects in the rivers killed an extremely large number of fish and other marine life. Large numbers of dead fish were reported as far as the Tennessee River and other area tributaries in the aftermath of the spill. =Cause= Engineering firm AECOM was hired by TVA to investigate the cause of the spill. A report released in June 2009 identified the main cause of the spill as the result of slippage of an unstable layer of fine wet coal ash underneath the pond. The report also identified other factors including the terraced retaining walls on top of the wet ash, which narrowed the area for storing the ash and in turn increased the pressure exerted on the dike by the rising stacks. The Kingston Fossil Plant received a total of of rain between December 1 and December 22, plus on November 29 and 30. This rain combined with temperatures were identified by TVA as factors that contributed to the failure of the earthen embankment. ResponseResponse from TVA and government officials= The day after the spill, TVA released a statement acknowledging the spill and apologizing for its damage to nearby homes. TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. said that the TVA was \\"taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident.\\" Residents and environmental groups expressed concern that the fly ash slurry could become more dangerous once it dried out. On January 1, 2009, the TVA disseminated a fact sheet stating that the ash is \\"not hazardous.\\" Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen toured the spill site on December 31, 2008. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the TVA, held a hearing on January 8 to examine the disaster. The environmental activist Erin Brockovich was invited to Tennessee to survey the disaster site, and announced plans to visit during the second week of January 2009. =Water quality and efforts to stop the spill= A wall of ash approximately from the retention pond Immediately after the spill, the EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) began testing the water quality of the area affected by the spill. Although residents feared water contamination, early tests of water six miles (10 km) upstream of the ash flow showed that the public water supply met drinking water standards. A test of river water near the spill showed elevated levels of lead and thallium, and \\"barely detectable\\" levels of mercury and arsenic. On January 1, 2009 the first independent test results, conducted at the Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry laboratories at Appalachian State University, showed significantly elevated levels of toxic metals, including arsenic, copper, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and thallium in samples of slurry and river water. The day after the spill Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) indicated that barriers would be constructed to stop the ash from reaching the Tennessee River. By early on December 24, 2008, a flyover by The New York Times did note repair work being done on the nearby railroad, which had been obstructed when of sludge covered tracks. By the afternoon of that day, dump trucks were being used to deposit rock into the Clinch River to prevent the further downstream contamination. The TVA also slowed the river flow, for the same purpose. The slurry that was cleared from Swan Pond Road was brought back to one of the plant's intact containment ponds. By December 30, 2008, the TVA had announced it was requesting the assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the ash-filled Emory River to restore navigation. On January 1, 2009 the TVA announced that rather than attempting to clear away all of the slurry, they would be spraying seed, straw, and mulch on top of much of it to prevent dust scattering and erosion. In response to independent attempts at sampling of the water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, two members of the Knoxville-based environmental organization United Mountain Defense who were traversing public land in the area of the spill and warned three other individuals that any attempt to enter the public waterway would lead to prosecution. On December 26, 2008 TDEC stated that it was satisfied with the water quality in the wake of the spill but that it would continue to examine and deal with the potential for chronic health effects. =Coal ash issues= The spill immediately reignited the debate about the regulation of coal ash. In response to a video that showed dead fish on the Clinch River, which had received runoff from the spill, TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. stated \\"in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic.\\" He continued by saying that \\"it does have some heavy metals within it, but it's not toxic or anything.\\" Chandra Taylor, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, called this statement irresponsible, and stated that coal fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury, arsenic, and benzene. She added, \\"These things are naturally occurring, but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts.\\" Nevertheless, due to pressure exerted in 2000 by utilities, the coal industry, and Clinton administration officials, fly ash is not strictly regulated as a hazardous waste by the EPA.EPA (2000-05-22). \\"Notice of Regulatory Determination on Wastes From the Combustion of Fossil Fuels.\\" Federal Register, . Lisa Evans, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the electric power and coal industries for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases, and stated the issue of proper disposal of coal ash is not an extremely complicated problem, and that utilities know how to solve it. Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, reported that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater, as recommended in a 2006 EPA report, and stated that he found it hard to believe that the State of Tennessee would have approved the ash disposal sites at the plant as a permanent disposal site. Governor Phil Bredesen acknowledged that TDEC, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA's own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells, and promised that there would be an extensive investigation into the cause of the spill in order to prevent similar disasters. Concern was also expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site after the spill. On December 27, 2008, TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although multiple environmental activists reported that they believed that TVA knew about the contents of the ash, due to the fact that they had tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it was believed that the area of the spill may have contained isolated patches of higher toxicity. At her Senate confirmation hearing on January 14, 2009, Lisa P. Jackson, then president-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the EPA under his administration, stated her intention to immediately review coal ash disposal sites across the country. Also on January 14, 2009, Nick J. Rahall, a U.S. Representative from West Virginia and the chairman of the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced a bill to regulate coal ash disposal sites across the United States. In 2009, TVA committed to switching all of the ash storage facilities at their coal fired plants over to dry byproduct methods, which would reduce the chances of another spill. TVA expects this to be complete by 2022 at a cost of $2 billion. At the time of the spill, five TVA-operated plants used this method, while Kingston and another five used a wet process with ponds. Cleanup Aerial footage of the spill. The EPA first estimated that the spill would take four to six weeks to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% of the spill had been cleaned and was estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA. TVA hired California-based Jacobs Engineering to clean up the spill. The cleanup was accomplished under guidelines set by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). However, the workers were not provided with personal protective equipment necessary to prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals contained within the coal ash. On May 11, 2009 TVA and the EPA announced an order and agreement that documents the relationship between TVA and EPA in managing the clean-up of the Kingston ash spill, further ensuring that TVA would meet all federal and state environmental requirements in restoring affected areas. During the first phase of the cleanup, known as the time-critical phase, over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed within a year of the spill. This phase allowed the removal of ash from the river to be accelerated by 75% over original expectations. During this phase, the ash was safely transported to a permanent, lined, and leachate collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill. The Emory River was reopened in late spring 2010. The time-critical phase removed 90% of the ash located in the Emory River. The next phase, which began in August 2010, removed the remaining ash from the Swan Pond Embayment of Watts Bar Reservoir. About 500,000 cubic yards of material, which mixed with the remains of leaked material from atomic energy production operations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the Cold War, was left in the rivers. The final phase of the cleanup consisted of assessments on the health and environmental effects of leaving this ash in the waterways. The cleanup was completed in 2015, and cost approximately $1.134 billion. In January 2017, the EPA announced that the ecosystems impacted by the spill had returned to conditions prior to the spill. During the cleanup TVA built a new protective levee around the pond, covered the ash pond with a earthquake-proof clay layer, and replanted the areas damaged by the spill. They also purchased 180 properties and 960 acres from landowners affected by the spill, and built a park on the former site of homes damaged by the spill. They also made more than $43 million in-lieu-of- tax payments to the local governments to compensate for lost property and sales tax revenue. Shortly after the cleanup was complete, TVA began selling off some of the land that they had acquired around the spill. Legal actions On December 23, 2008 the environmental group Greenpeace asked for a criminal investigation into the incident, focusing on whether the TVA could have prevented the spill. On December 30, 2008 a group of landowners filed suit against the TVA for $165 million in Tennessee state court. Also on December 30, 2008 the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy announced its intention to sue the TVA under the federal Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. On February 4, 2009, the EPA and TDEC issued a letter to TVA in which the EPA provided notice to TVA that they consider the release to be an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant in violation of the Clean Water Act. On August 23, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, representing more than 800 plaintiffs, found TVA liable for the spill. Judge Thomas A. Varlan, issued an opinion stating that \\"TVA is liable for the ultimate failure of North Dike which flowed, in part, from TVA's negligent nondiscretionary conduct.\\" The ruling ultimately found that TVA did not build the holding ponds according to the initial plan and failed to train its employees on how to properly inspect the dikes surrounding the ash ponds, leading ultimately to a failure to maintain the facility to prevent a rupture of the dikes. Some critics of the EPA's response claim that the choice of how to deal with the spilled coal ash was an act of environmental racism. Roane County's population is more than 94% White, and the EPA shipped the toxic coal ash 300 miles south to Uniontown, Alabama, which has a population that is more than 90% African American. Dr. Robert D. Bullard, a champion for the victims of environmental racism, claimed that the EPA's response was a prioritization of the health of Caucasian Americans over the health of African Americans. In 2018, the EPA dismissed a complaint by the residents of Uniontown that charged that the landfill was in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A number of workers suffered health effects in the years following the spill at the cleanup site. As early as 2012, workers began to report illnesses that they believed were caused by the cleanup, and by the ten year anniversary of the event, hundreds of workers had been sickened and more than 30 had died. In 2013, 50 workers and their families filed a lawsuit against contractor Jacobs Engineering. They were represented by Knoxville lawyer James K. Scott. This lawsuit was dismissed by judge Thomas A. Varlan, chief justice for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee the following year. This ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit after evidence was discovered that Jacobs Engineering had misled the workers about the dangers of coal ash. A federal jury ruled in favor of the workers seeking compensation in November 2018. The ruling held that Jacobs Engineering had failed to keep the workers safe from environmental hazards, and had misled them about the dangers of coal ash, mainly by claiming that extra protective equipment, such as masks and protective clothing, was unnecessary. Despite the ruling, Jacobs Engineering has maintained that it acted appropriately. Tom Bock, the top Jacobs safety officer on-site, claimed that many of the accusations about the cleanup effort and safety of the workers were false or contained misinformation. An attorney for Jacobs Engineering also claimed that the company had not been found liable for the illnesses contracted by the workers. TVA has also denied wrongdoing in the case, but in September 2019 a TVA board member was reported to have told a U.S. Senate committee that he would not allow a member of his family to clean up coal ash without a dust mask. In a phase two of the trial, the Kingston clean-up workers will be able to seek damages. In April 2020, 52 workers rejected a $10 million settlement offered by Jacobs Engineering.

Coat of arms ! Map ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  140px 140px - !colspan=2 Location: } Salmannsdorferstra√üe Salmannsdorf (Central Bavarian: Salmaunsduaf) is a part of D√∂bling, the 19th district of Vienna. Wien.gv.at webpage (see below: References). Salmannsdorf was an independent municipality until 1892, when it was incorporated into the W√§hring district of the city of Vienna. However, in 1938, Salmannsdorf was reassigned together with Neustift am Walde to the district of D√∂bling. Salmannsdorf lies along the western border of Sievering. It is one of the 10 municipalities in the district of D√∂bling.  Geography  Dreimarksteingasse (street), in the centre of Salmannsdorf. Salmannsdorf is located in the northwest of Vienna and is part of the district of D√∂bling. Salmannsdorf lies on the southern slope of Dreimarkstein hill, in the valley of the Krottenbach stream. The Katastralgemeinde stretches across an area of 66.05 hectares. The region is part of the statistical census-district of Salmannsdorf-Glanzing. In the south, Salmannsdorf borders on Neustift am Walde; in the east, on Obersievering. The border in the west divides it from Neuwaldegg; in the north lies the Dreimarkstein hill, with the border to Hinterweidling in Lower Austria. History The origin of the name Salmannsdorf = Salmannsdorf was first mentioned in 1279 as Salmanstorf. The name derives either from the personal name Salman or the professional title Salmann (a trustee or clerk). = Salmannsdorf in modern times = The chapel in the centre of Salmannsdorf. Salmannsdorf‚Äôs location suggests that it was a planned settlement. Over time, it developed into a village typical of the area, with several streets and an economy and lifestyle that revolved around viticulture. In 1680, there were already 30 houses in Salmannsdorf, but the village‚Äôs development was stunted by the terrible devastation of the second siege of Vienna. In 1683, Salmannsdorf was completely destroyed. Two major outbreaks of fire did further damage in the ensuing years. The village had just 18 houses when the plague struck in 1713, killing 74 of the 118 inhabitants. 120 years later, Salmannsdorf had still barely exceeded its former size. Salmannsdorf first began to grow around the middle of the 19th century, when, like its neighbour Neustift am Walde, it profited from tourists attracted by its fine summer weather. Salmannsdorf was not overly popular with Vienna‚Äôs wealthy families, but regular visitors between 1829 and 1832 included the family of Johann Strau√ü the Elder. A plaque at number 13 in the Dreimarksteingasse celebrates the fact that Johann Strau√ü the Elder wrote his first waltz here. In 1890, there were 312 people living in 94 houses in Salmannsdorf. In 1892, Salmannsdorf, along with the surrounding suburbs of Neustift am Walde, W√§hring, Weinhaus, Gersthof and P√∂tzleinsdorf was integrated into Vienna as the district of W√§hring. In a reorganisation of the district boundaries in 1938, Salmannsdorf and Neustift am Walde were assigned to the 19th district, D√∂bling.  Economy  Old Farmhouse (where Johann Strau√ü the Elder stayed). The distribution of available land at the start of the 19th century makes clear the importance of both forests and vineyards for the local economy. In 1826, woods occupied two thirds of the land, which belonged to the Klosterneuburg Monastery. Pasture occupied 15 percent, while vineyards made up another seven percent. There were no notable orchids or fields. The inhabitants lived first and foremost from the sale of wine and dairy products. When the dairy industry declined in the 19th century, wine remained as the primary source of income, and to this day wine is sold in local Heurige.  Rail, road and bus links  Originally, there was a wagon train that passed through Neustift to Salmannsdorf, with varying destinations in the city over the years. For financial reasons, the operation of this transport link also changed hands several times, even though it was the only such connection to receive subventions from the City of Vienna. In 1908, the Wiener Linien introduced a trolleybus operating the Merc√©d√®s-√âlectrique-Stoll system from P√∂tzleinsdorf via Neustift am Walde to Salmannsdorf. This was one of the longest-serving routes using this system and it was only replaced in 1938 by an omnibus with the route number 23. The route was however cancelled the following year. In 1928, a bus running along the Krottenbachstra√üe to Neustift and Salmannsdorf was introduced (from 1935 the number 20). Because this route took it past factories that were necessary for the war effort, this was the last bus route in Vienna that was still running in World War II. In 1942, preparations were made to introduce trolleybuses, which happened in 1946, but in 1958, motor-powered buses were re-introduced. From 1945 to 1961, this was the route number 22; thereafter and until 1972, it bore the number 39A, and since then, it has been the number 35A. This bus runs from the Spittelau station along the Krottenbachstra√üe via Neustift am Walde to its final destination in Salmannsdorf.

Until 2014, he was Director of the Center for Policy Innovation at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C. He is a health care analyst and commentator, and he has also written extensively about urban policy and welfare, credited with introducing the idea of urban enterprise zones to the United States. Butler was an adjunct professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute. Early life and education Butler was raised in Shropshire, England and emigrated to the United States in 1975. He holds bachelor‚Äôs degrees in physics and mathematics, a master‚Äôs degree in economics and a doctorate in American economic history from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Career Butler has been at Brookings since the Fall of 2014. He joined The Heritage Foundation in 1979 as a policy analyst, specializing in health care and urban issues. After visiting tenements in the South Bronx and Washington, D.C. to discuss with residents how best to address problems with public housing, Butler published a paper for Heritage that introduced the idea of Urban Enterprise Zones in the United States. The idea caught the attention of many politicians, including Jack Kemp and, later, the Reagan Administration. By the mid-1990s, more than 30 states and the District of Columbia had instituted enterprise zones in depressed urban areas. During the 1980s, Butler wrote three books on issues central to his work: Enterprise Zones: Greenlining the Inner Cities (1981), Privatizing Federal Spending (1985), and Out of the Poverty Trap (1987), co-authored with Anna Kondratas. In 1989, Butler also co-authored A National Health System for America with Edmund Haislmaier. Butler has played a prominent role in the debate over health care reform, arguing for market-based solutions to high numbers of uninsured individuals and high health care costs. The health insurance mandate in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is an idea hatched in 1989 by Butler at the Heritage Foundation, in a publication titled \\"Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans\\". This was also the model for Mitt Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts. Heritage and Butler formulated an alternative proposal to President Bill Clinton‚Äôs 1993 plan to overhaul health care. Michael Kinsley, then editor of The New Republic, called the Heritage proposal \\"the simplest, most promising, and in an important way, the most progressive idea for health care reform\\". In 1999, The National Journal named Butler as one of 12 \\"key players\\" in Washington in the health care debate. In the fall of 2002, Butler was a fellow for one semester at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Butler also received the George Washington Honor Medal for his work on urban policy and the Valley Forge Honor Certificate from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge for a book on privatization. Starting in 2005, Butler was a major participant in the Fiscal Wake-Up Tour ‚Äì a group traveling the country to build public support for reforming Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Other experts involved in the tour include U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and analysts from the Brookings Institution and the Concord Coalition. The tour continued up to September 2010. After serving as Vice President for Domestic and Economic Policy Studies at Heritage since 1992, Butler became director of the Center for Policy Innovation at The Heritage Foundation in August 2010. He is the co-author of a plan designed to balance the budget within 10 years, called Saving the American Dream: Heritage‚Äôs Plan to Fix the Debt, Cut Spending, and Restore Prosperity, which was released by Heritage in May 2011, one of six plans put forward by research organizations to address the U.S. financial crisis. In September 2014, Butler left the Heritage Foundation and joined the Brookings Institution's Economic Studies program as a senior fellow. Butler is a board member of the Convergence Center for Policy Resolution, an organization that brings stakeholders together on contentious issues and uses professional facilitation to seek common ground. Butler is also a board member of Mary's Center, a system of community clinics in Washington DC and Maryland. Personal life Butler became a U.S. citizen in 1996. He and his wife reside in Washington, D.C. His brother is Eamonn Butler.

In 2012, it included nearly 43,000 processors representing 301 teraflops of computing power. DiaGrid received a Campus Technology Innovators Award from Campus Technology magazine and an IDG InfoWorld 100 Award in 2009 and was employed at the SC09 supercomputing conference in Portland, Ore., to capture nearly 150 days of compute time for science jobs. Partners DiaGrid is a partnership with Purdue, Indiana University, Indiana State University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska, the University of Wisconsin, Purdue's Calumet and North Central campuses, and Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. It is designed to accommodate computers at other campuses as new members join. The Purdue portion of the pool, named BoilerGrid, is the largest academic system of its kind. Management DiaGrid is managed by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the central information technology organization at Purdue's West Lafayette campus, and ITaP's research computing unit the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, which also operates the Steele, Coates, Rossmann, Hansen and Carter cluster supercomputers. HTCondor Through HTCondor, developed at the University of Wisconsin, DiaGrid harvests and manages computing cycles from idle or underused high-performance computing cluster nodes, servers, machines in campus computer and other labs, and office computers. Whenever a local user or scheduled job needs a given machine, the HTCondor job is stopped and automatically sent to another HTCondor node as soon as possible. While this \\"opportunistic\\" model limits the ability to do parallel processing and communications, a HTCondor pool can provide smaller, serial jobs vast numbers of cycles in a very short amount of time. HTCondor‚Äîand by extension, DiaGrid‚Äîis designed for high-throughput computing and is excellent for parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo simulation, or nearly any serial application. Some classes of parallel jobs (master-worker) may be run effectively via HTCondor as well. Networking To pool computational resources spread around Indiana and the Midwest, DiaGrid takes advantage of I-Light, the high-speed fiber-optic state network connecting Indiana campuses to each other, the Internet and national research networks such as the Internet2 and National LambdaRail. DiaGrid provides computational resources to researchers on both the Open Science Grid and the U.S. National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment system (formerly TeraGrid). Uses DiaGrid and BoilerGrid have been used by researchers at Purdue and elsewhere for a variety of purposes, such as imaging the structure of viruses at near-atomic resolutions, simulating the early stages of the Solar System's formation, projecting the reliability of Indiana's electrical supply, modeling the spread of water pollutants, discerning the structure of protein molecules and identifying millions of potential new forms of zeolites, silicate minerals widely used to catalyze chemical reactions on an industrial scale. DiaGrid also is being used to develop data processing techniques for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Purdue added a Web-based portal for BLAST processing with DiaGrid in 2011.

Sadness of our Lord Jacob) is a mosque situated on the lower slopes of Mount Gerizim in the southwestern quarter of the Old City of Nablus in the West Bank. The mosque is rectangular in shape, and its minaret rises .Pringle, 1993, pp.112. History Minaret of al-Khadra Mosque, early 20th century According to Muslim tradition, the mosque is situated upon the site where Jacob wept after being shown Joseph's blood-soaked tunic which suggested that he had been mauled and killed; on the right of the courtyard is a small room said to be the place where Jacob sat down and wept.Feyerick (1996) p 148 Hence the mosque's alternative name \\"Sadness of our Lord Jacob\\".Luke, 1922, p.102. According to Samaritan tradition, al-Khadra Mosque had been a synagogue destroyed by the Crusaders. They claim that its Arabic name al-Khadra (\\"the Green\\") derived from the Samaritan Mahallat Khadra (\\"the place of the Green\\"). Archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah identified the Khadra Mosque with the synagogue built by the Samaritan high priest Akbon in 362 CE.Avi-Yonah, Michael. Discussion: Mount Ephraim and Benjamin, 35. Neapolis - (Nablus) Studium Biblicum Franciscum - Jerusalem. 2000-12-19. The synagogue was rebuilt in 1137 by Ab Giluga, a Samaritan from Acre. Several Western scholars, however, believe, because of examples of Gothic architecture in portions of the present-day mosque, that in the 1170s, there stood a Crusader church and bell tower.Pringle, 1993, p.111 Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi records in 1225, while Nablus was under Ayyubid rule, the buildings was restored to become a Samaritan synagogue, which he referred to as \\"a large mosque\\" which the Samaritans venerated.al-Hamawi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 512 It is probably from this era that the Samaritan inscriptions on a minaret wall were made.Herbermann, 1913, p.417 In 1242, however, the Knights Templars damaged the building, which was later destroyed in 1260 by the Mongols.Pringle, 1993, pp.112-113. It was transformed as a mosque in 1290 by the Mamluks during the reign of Sultan Qalawun as attested to by a foundation inscription.Dumper, Stanley and Abu-Lughod (2007) p 266 Most of the structure resembles Mamluk architecture and a mihrab was added to the mosque. =Second Intifada= According to the Palestinian government and Gush Shalom, during the Second Intifada in the Battle of Nablus in 2002, Israeli bulldozers destroyed 85% of the mosque, including the Mamluk-era mihrab.Report on the Destruction to Palestinian Institutions in Nablus and Other Cities (Except Ramallah) Caused by IDF Forces Between March 29 and April 21, 2002 Gush Shalom. 2002-04-22.Destruction of Nablus Old City, a war crime, Palestinian minister Arabic News. 2002-08-13.Gresh (2004) p 171 The current imam of al-Khadra Mosque, Maher Kharaz (the 'White Lion'), was removed from his position in a Palestinian Authority 'crack down' on militant imams in 1996, but was reinstated in 2006.Ha'aretz 30 June 2007 Hamas preacher defies PA gov't ban on incitement in mosques By The Associated PressJpost 23 September 2007 Palestinian forces arrest prominent Hamas preacher Kharaz, a Hamas member and opponent of Fatah, regularly defied the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority during his weekly Friday sermons.Hamas preacher defies government order to stop talking politics in mosques International Herald Tribune and Associated Press. 2007-06-28.

He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Tyler Reks. He has also competed in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling, where he held the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship once and the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, once with Joe Hennig and once with Johnny Curtis. Since retiring from professional wrestling, Tuft works in marketing. He also launched a fitness website with several other wrestlers.ref Early life Tuft was born on November 1, 1978, in San Francisco, California. Tuft attended the Santa Rosa Junior College in Santa Rosa, California from 1996-1999 and then transferred to the California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly-SLO) in 2000. There he completed his coursework and obtained a degree in civil engineering with a major in hydrology and structural engineering. After graduating, Tuft secured a job as an assistant engineer at PBS&J; in Encinitas, California. He was staffed at the City of Dana Point as an extension of staff and was in charge of the Public Works Permitting Department. Professional wrestling careerIndependent circuit (2007‚Äì2008)= Tuft was trained by Mike Bell. He made his professional debut in February 2007 for Ultimate Pro Wrestling. =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE=Florida Championship Wrestling (2008‚Äì2009) Tuft was signed to a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in January 2008 and was assigned to the Florida Championship Wrestling territory as Tyler Reks. He made his FCW debut on February 5, 2008 with Johnny Curtis in a losing effort against Eric P√©rez and Eddie Colon. A few days later on February 12 he made his singles FCW debut in a losing effort once again against \\"The South City Thriller\\" Hade Vansen. He participated in a FCW Florida Heavyweight Title Battle Royal which was won by Jake Hager. He also took part in FCW Florida Tag Team Title Tournament with Rycklon, during this tournament he had his first victory at FCW defeating Ted DiBiase, Jr. and Afa, Jr. in the first round, however the pair were to lose Eddie Colon and Eric Perez in the quarter finals. Tuft then had two chances at FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship against the current champion Jake Hager first in a one on one match and then in a triple threat match along with Johnny Curtis. On the August 28 he participated in FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship No. 1 Contendership Fatal Four Way along with Johnny Curtis, Tyrone Evans and Sheamus O'Shaunessy, who went on to win the match. Tuft then went on to have another two FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship shots against Sheamus O'Shaunessy and lost both times. On December 11, 2008, Reks and Johnny Curtis defeated The New Hart Foundation (DH Smith and TJ Wilson) to win the Florida Tag Team Championship in Tampa, Florida. After numerous defenses and 139 days of holding the titles they lost them to Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta. Tuft won FCW Florida Heavyweight Title No. 1 Contendership match and on June 11, 2009, he captured the Florida Heavyweight Championship by defeating Drew McIntyre. He later lost the title to Heath Slater at the FCW television tapings on August 13. He later lost to Slater again during his rematch for the title. He lost to Joe Hennig in a FCW Florida Heavyweight Title No. 1 Contendership match and lost a FCW Florida Heavyweight Title No. 1 Contendership battle royal. He and Leo Kruger had a FCW Florida Tag Team Title match against Epico but lost. ECW (2009‚Äì2010) He made his main roster debut on ECW on Sci Fi on the June 30, 2009 episode, with a surfer in-ring persona, in a backstage promo with Zack Ryder. Reks had suffered a knee injury just prior to his debut, but was able to work through it and made his in-ring debut on the July 2, 2009 episode of WWE Superstars, losing to Ryder. On the July 21 episode of ECW, Reks gained his first win after defeating Paul Burchill, and then beat him again the following week. Reks participated in a 10-man battle royal on the September 15 edition of ECW for an ECW Championship opportunity against Christian, but the match would go on to be won by Zack Ryder. Tuft would begin a brief hiatus from television starting in November 2009 and began mainly working dark matches and house shows for both Smackdown and Raw and FCW matches. Reks was one of the participants in the 26 man pre- show battle royal at WrestleMania XXVI.  SmackDown (2010‚Äì2011)  Reks in November 2010 In April 2010, Reks joined the SmackDown roster following ECW's closure. After months of only working dark matches, Reks made his SmackDown television debut as a heel on the October 15 edition of the program while sporting a beard, chest hair and new attire in addition to never referencing to his time on ECW. After a promo, he challenged and successfully defeated Kaval in a match for the latter's spot in the SmackDown Bragging Rights team. On the Raw before Bragging Rights, he participated in a SmackDown vs. RAW 30 Man Tag Team Battle Royal, in which Smackdown was victorious. At Bragging Rights, Reks was able to eliminate Santino Marella before being eliminated by Sheamus. However, Team SmackDown was successful in winning the Bragging Rights Cup for the second consecutive time, which would end up being Reks' most significant accomplishment in his WWE career. After this, Reks was placed in Alberto Del Rio's Survivor Series team and at the event. On the Smackdown before Survivor Series 2010 he competed in a Ten Man Tag Team Battle Royal but his team lost. At Survivor Series 2010 he was eliminated by Kofi Kingston as Team Del Rio went on to lose the match to Team Mysterio. Reks was then moved into a feud with Chris Masters, defeating him once on SmackDown and twice on WWE Superstars. On January 30, 2011, Reks made his Royal Rumble debut as he entered the match as the sixteenth entrant, but was eliminated from the match in only 34 seconds by CM Punk and the New Nexus. Reks was involved in another dark battle royal at Wrestlemania 27. Reks participated in and lost a World Heavyweight Title No. 1 Contendership 20 Man Battle Royal. His last in ring television performance for five months would be beating JTG on Superstars. Teaming with Curt Hawkins (2011‚Äì2012) Reks with his partner Curt Hawkins On April 26, Reks was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2011 Supplemental Draft. After wrestling dark matches for a few months, Reks made his Raw debut in a backstage segment with Curt Hawkins, Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio. On the September 8 edition of Superstars, Reks made his in-ring return as he teamed with Hawkins to defeat Titus O'Neil and Percy Watson. Hawkins and Reks then began appearing on the fifth season of NXT, by attacking the Usos from behind on the September 27 episode NXT. Over the next two weeks on NXT, Hawkins and Reks faced the Usos in tag team matches, with Hawkins and Reks winning the first match and the Usos winning the second match. Reks made his singles return on October 16 losing to Yoshi Tatsu. Reks participated in a World Heavyweight Championship number 1 contender 41 man battle royal and the \\"All I Want For Christmas Battle Royal\\" and was eliminated in both. Hawkins and Reks would lose to The Usos once again on December 6. Reks and Hawkins would then lose a non-title match to the tag team champions Air Boom on the December 22 episode of Superstars. Hawkins and Reks would feud with the duo of Trent Barreta and Yoshi Tatsu from December 2011. Both teams would play pranks on each other, with Tatsu being locked in a closet and Reks' hands being superglued onto an Xbox controller. The feud ended when Hawkins and Reks defeated Barreta and Tatsu on the January 18 episode of NXT. Hawkins and Reks would then settle into the role of NXT's troublemakers, tormenting NXT host Matt Striker on his lackluster career and how they should be main-eventing NXT, even once going to the extent of assaulting him after a match. This forced Striker to appoint William Regal as NXT's prime authority figure on the February 29 episode of NXT. Regal would employ harsh measures to keep Hawkins and Reks in line, including threatening suspensions for bad behaviour and condemning them to janitorial duty, this caused them much frustration. On the March 21 episode of NXT Redemption, Striker was knocked out with chloroform by Johnny Curtis and Maxine, and then Striker was kidnapped (kayfabe) by unknown persons, later revealed to be Hawkins and Reks, who intended to blackmail Maxine into using her charms to get Regal to leave them alone. Unfortunately for Hawkins and Reks, Striker was rescued by Derrick Bateman and Kaitlyn. On the April 18 episode of NXT, the freed Striker confronted Hawkins and Reks about the kidnapping, and Hawkins admitted the crime. As punishment, Regal put Hawkins and Reks in a match against each other with Striker as referee and the loser of the match would be fired. Even though Reks won to supposedly save his job at the expense of Hawkins', Regal decided to fire Reks as well, sending the two troublemakers away from NXT. However, Regal could not keep the duo away from NXT for long, as they managed to convince villainous higher authority figure John Laurinaitis to rehire them as NXT's security team on the May 9 episode of NXT. Hawkins and Reks would then continue to play the role of Laurinaitis' lackeys, confiscating anti-Laurinaitis signs at Over the Limit and attacking John Cena on the May 21 episode of Raw. Hawkins and Reks' association with Laurinaitis ended after Laurinaitis lost his job at No Way Out. On the final episode of the fifth season of NXT on June 13, Hawkins and Reks defeated Percy Watson and Derrick Bateman. Hawkins and Reks would then engage in a one-sided feud with Ryback in July 2012. After both Hawkins and Reks lost singles matches to Ryback on SmackDown, Ryback defeated both of them in a handicap match at Money in the Bank. At Raw 1000, Hawkins and Reks, along with Jinder Mahal, Drew McIntyre, Hunico and Camacho, attempted to ambush Kane to make a statement, but a returning The Undertaker interrupted the attack and The Brothers of Destruction disposed of Hawkins and Reks. The duo would once again lose to Ryback on the August 6 episode of Raw. After being told by SmackDown General Manager Booker T to \\"step it up\\", Hawkins and Reks debuted a stripper gimmick on the August 17 episode of SmackDown while squashing a jobber tag team. A week later, Reks asked for his release as he intended to retire from wrestling to spend more time with his family; he and WWE parted ways on August 21, thus ending the team. =Return to independent circuit (2014)= Reuniting with Curt Hawkins, the pair tagged together as part of Pro Wrestling Syndicate picking up a win in September against Kevin Matthews and Lance Hoyt.PWS Ten Thirty One published 16 September 2014 In other media Reks, together with Curt Hawkins, created an animated YouTube series called MidCard Mafia in 2011, which was quickly cancelled and pulled from the internet after complaints from WWE management.

History In the 1870s, early white explorers described the Warumungu as a flourishing nation.The Warumungu: The Land is Always Alive Retrieved 23 December 2008 However, by 1915, invasion and reprisal had brought them to the brink of starvation.Blackwell-Reference Online: Warumungu (Australian: Pama‚ÄìNyungan) Retrieved 23 December 2008 In 1934, a reserve that had been set aside for the Warumungu in 1892 was revoked in order to clear the way for gold prospecting. By the 1960s, the Warumungu had been entirely removed from their native land. Current status Warumungu is classified as a living language, but its number of speakers seemed to be decreasing quickly. In the mid-1950s, Australian linguist Robert Hoogenraad estimated that there were only about 700 people who could speak some Warumungu;Aboriginal Child Language Acquisition Project: Warumungu Retrieved 22 December 2008 by 1983, the population was estimated to be as small as 200 speakers.\\"Ethnologue report for language code:wrm.\\" in Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

Today, the language is in a robust position compared to many indigenous Australian languages, as it is being acquired by children and used in daily interaction by all generations, and the situation is sustainable though some ethnic group members may prefer Kriol.

In India It is a widespread native fish. In South India, it is commonly found in reservoirs. It is found in Pechipparai, Chittar, Manimuthar, Bhvani and Mettur dams of Tamil Nadu and Thenmalai, Neyyar and Idukki dams of Kerala. It can also be found in the reservoirs of Himachal Pradesh such as the Pong Dam (Maharana Pratap Sagar), where it is known locally as soal. C. marulius is commonly known as giant murrel. In Assam it is locally known as xal (Assamese: ‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶≤). They are faster-growing fish than most of the other species of the genus. At times they are sold live and fetch high prices in the market, due to their excellent tasting flesh and lack of fine bones. They are suitable for intensive culture due to their air-breathing habit. In Andhra & Telangana it is called Korrameenu, and is quite common in lakes and reservoirs. In the United States In the United States, it can be found in waterways throughout South Florida originating from the C-14 Canal where the species was first introduced. Chances of this warm water species migrating to Northern Florida are slim. The bullseye snakehead has not been documented outside of Florida in the United States.

He was born the son of Toronto- based filmmakers Ross Turnbull and Jennifer Hazel, and graduated from the Claude Watson School of the Arts in 2006. Twig began self-releasing music in 2005 and eventually earned a deal with Paper Bag Records. His first album under the label was Contempt!, released in 2009. He also worked in the film industry, playing \\"Billy Zero\\" in the 2007 film The Tracey Fragments. Other films he has appeared in are Dog Pound and Sight Unseen, in which he played the film's lead character. Twig co-founded the Calico Corp. record label alongside American-Canadian U.S. Girls. Twig's second album under Paper Bag, Sof' Sike, was released in August 2012. His third studio album, A Hound at the Hem, was released under Calico Corp. three months later. This album was eventually re-released by DFA Records, who signed Twig in 2014. In 2015, he released a cover version of Serge Gainsbourg's \\"Cannabis\\" as well as his fourth studio album, Thank You for Stickin' with Twig, both under DFA Records. Film work Slim Twig played 'Billy Zero' in the 2007 film, The Tracey Fragments, directed by Bruce McDonald and starring Ellen Page. Slim was cast as 'Max' in French director Kim Chapiron's film, Dog Pound, set in a juvenile detention centre, and plays the lead character in an independent feature film produced by his parents entitled Sight Unseen, for which he also composed the score.Cited in The New Wave: The Hottest Names to Know in Canadian Music, Flare, September, 2009, Vol. 31, No. 9, pg. 139 He has acted in numerous commercial productions and shorts, and scored other films. In 2013, he composed the score for the documentary, We Come as Friends, directed by Hubert Sauper. Music Paper Bag Records has released two Slim Twig EPs and two, full-length albums. His most recent LP, A Hound at the Hem, was released by his own label, Calico Corp., in conjunction with Pleasence Records. In September 2014, New York-based DFA Records announced that it is re-releasing A Hound at the Hem. In addition to Slim Twig-branded music, the artist played guitar and sang in the band, Tropics, with Simone TB on drums. In a review of his early Slim Twig EPs, Pitchfork Media stated that Tropics' music is ‚Äúa feral take on the Birthday Party's blitzkrieg blues.‚Äù Tropics is now defunct, having added members and transformed into Darlene Shrugg. Slim Twig has also formerly pursued a solo project called Archaic Women and played as part of a ‚Äúpsychedelic cover band‚Äù called Plastic Factory. In 2009, Tropics released a cassette tape entitled SETTE. The earliest Slim Twig recordings were self- released in 2005 on a CD entitled Livestock Burn, and an EP, Dissonant Folk. Derelict Dialect was the first Slim Twig EP release from Paper Bag Records, in April, 2008. Prior to that, Slim Twig self-released an EP called Whiite Fantaseee. The songs from that recording (save one) were subsequently re- mastered and issued as Vernacular Violence by Paper Bag Records, in August, 2008. Paper Bag later released its two Slim Twig EPs as a limited edition, vinyl LP album. In 2009, Paper Bag Records released Contempt!, Slim Twig's first, full-length LP. He states that he created the record largely from found sound and samples set against his own vocals. A NOW magazine review of the album called it ‚Äústartlingly unique.‚Äù Coinciding with the release of Contempt!, Slim created a free, downloadable ‚Äúmixtape‚Äù EP entitled Spit It Twig! (Vol. 1). Spit it Twig! Vol 2 was issued in the fall of 2009. It was named one of the top downloads of the year by Toronto's alternative weekly magazines. The third release in the mixtape series is A Sheik in Scores, issued on cassette and as a download. =Recent work= In 2011, Slim Twig professed to a change of direction, stating in an interview with NOW magazine that he is \\"...reinventing himself as a 60s pop craftsman.\\" His first foray in this direction was a split recording with U.S. Girls, whose side he co- produced, on FatCat subsidiary label, Palmist Records. The release was well received. Slim Twig also produced the two most recent U.S. Girls LPs, U.S. Girls on Kraak and Gem. Slim Twig and U.S. Girls jointly created their own label, Calico Corp., and each artist issued a 7\\" single as the label's first productions. In addition to co-releasing A Hound at the Hem, Calico Corp. released an EP, Flushing Meats, by Eric Copeland, and most recently, Zacht Automaat, a double LP by the eponymously named Toronto duo. In August 2012, Paper Bag released their second Slim Twig LP, Sof' Sike, which garnered positive reviews. Calico Corp. and Pleasence Records then issued A Hound at the Hem, in November, although it was apparently completed prior to Sof' Sike. While cited as \\"...a pop record that completely forgets it's a pop record...‚Äú, A Hound at the Hem has elsewhere been effusively praised as \\"...a new masterpiece...one of the best post-glam concept albums not made in the slippery 70s‚Äù, and cited as critic Alan Ranta's choice for Canada's prestigious Polaris prize. The same writer, in reviewing the album subsequent to DFA's re-release, stated that \\"Canada dropped the ball, failing to recognize the genius in its own backyard.\\" On April 20, 2015, Slim Twig released a cover version of the Serge Gainsbourg track \\"Cannabis\\", in celebration of 4/20. The cover was released by DFA Records as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl. A music video for the cover was released exactly one year later. In addition to re-releasing A Hound at the Hem, DFA released Slim Twig's follow-up album, Thank You for Stickin' with Twig, on August 7, 2015. Critical reception Slim Twig has received considerable, occasionally polarized press coverage (in print and on the internet), with much of it recognizing his unusual adventurousness and artistry. In 2008, the artist was called ‚Äúan icon-in-the-making‚Äù and named Toronto's Best Pop/Rock Artist of the year by Now magazine. In various articles about Slim Twig, well-known popular music artists have been mentioned for comparison purposes, notably including Nick Cave, Lou Reed, Suicide, and David Bowie. In a concert review, music columnist Sarah Liss suggested that Slim Twig's music sounds like ‚Äú...what might happen if you left a bunch of Elvis Presley LPs on a radiator, smashed them to bits with a hammer and re-assembled them for play on a turntable. In a word, otherworldly.‚ÄùCBC News, Arts & Entertainment, CMW 2008 Blog by Sarah Liss, March 8, 2008 He has on more than one occasion, and in a positive context, been called a \\"pop weirdo\\". Of his music, one site suggests that \\"It isn't possible to get more post-modern pop.\\" Slim Twig's early interest in experimentation appeared to challenge critics looking to situate him in a pop music context. One writer found the songs on Contempt! \\"...like the oddly appropriate soundtracks to confounding four dimensional art installations...\\" Critics also have suggested the influence of cinema on Slim Twig, with one remarking on ‚Äú...his compulsive soliloquist's flair, a direct but static- filled line into a collective cinematic unconscious.‚ÄùThe Globe and Mail: Ten Acts You Shouldn't Miss by Robert Everett-Green and Carl Wilson, published June 3, 2008 Indeed, in speaking about his creative approach, the artist cited his admiration for David Lynch's work.

Interior, with stained glass windows. Altar‚Äîgolden and handmade in Lyons, France. Immaculate Conception church, locally known as Jesuit church, is a Roman Catholic church in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana. The church is located at 130 Baronne Street, and is part of the local Jesuit community. The present church, completed in 1930, is a near duplicate of an earlier 1850s church on the same site. History First building of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in 1873 Two Immaculate Conception churches, nearly identical to each other, were built on the same site over time. The first church was designed by Fr. John Cambiaso, S.J., and completed in 1857. In the late 1920s, it suffered foundation damage due to the construction of the Pere Marquette building. The church's floor split in half. The building was disassembled in 1928. New footings at the same site were laid in 1929 with the cornerstone laid on 16 May 1929. The new church building, incorporating many fixtures from the older church, was dedicated on 2 March 1930. Architecture Immaculate Conception church was built and designed in the Neo-Venetian Gothic style of Gothic Revival architecture, with Moorish Revival and Byzantine Revival elements. =Interior= When one enters the church, one is met with the enormous height of the nave, compared to other churches in New Orleans. The columns begin with niches in which small statues of archangels stand, and then what is reminiscent of a Solomonic column. The many stained glass windows of the church, depicting Jesuit saints, are among the finer in America. They are seen when facing back towards the entrance. The interior also is furnished with religious paintings and murals. The pews are made of cast iron, with Moorish tracery, rosettes, and designs particularly symbolic of scriptural references. The chandeliers of fine bronze are of both Moorish and Byzantine styles. The brilliant altar was handmade in Lyons, France, and is 24 karat gold-plated. The central focal point of the church is \\"Mary's Niche\\", a solid-marble statue of the Blessed Virgin standing in front of a gilded, lit background. At the same level are found four other statues of saints. =College chapel= As the Jesuit province in New Orleans grew, the Jesuits purchased the plot of land which is now Jesuit High School. Beforehand the school, called Immaculate Conception College, was adjacent to the church. The Jesuit priests lived inside an area of Jesuit High School which contains a chapel (Thomas Semmes Memorial Chapel) of the same architectural design as the church (the chapel was disassembled then moved to Jesuit's present location). This chapel is not to be confused with the Chapel of the North American Martyrs at Jesuit High School, which was completed in 1953 in a Neoclassical style and is much larger. =Louisiana Cotton Exposition Organ= The remnants of the 1884 World Cotton Centennial or Louisiana Cotton Exposition Organ are housed within the church. The pipe organ was originally built by Pilcher, and was the biggest pipe organ manufactured by the company. When it was being played inside the fair building, it caused the collapse of the main tent. The organ had major renovations and additions by M.P. Moller before it was given to the Jesuit Fathers. It operated in the original church and was moved to the Fairmont Hotel, across the street, while the church was being reconstructed. Then the organ was installed in the 'new' 1929 church, with modifications by M.P. Moller. The organ's facade contained tall Open Diapason pipes, with Moorish Revival style stenciling on them. The organ was later abandoned, but left intact inside the structure. There are large swell shades in the walls at the back of the church. It was replaced by a much smaller organ by Pilcher. After several years of using the second smaller organ, the church replaced it with a digital organ by Phoenix. ;Access The church offers tours daily at 3 pm.

These now extinct birds form their own family, representing the only complete extinction of an entire avian family in modern times, when the disputed family Turnagridae is regarded as invalid. Until recently, these birds were thought to belong to the family Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) due to their very similar appearance and behavior, including many morphological details. However, a 2008 study argued, on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of DNA from museum specimens, that the genera Moho and Chaetoptila are not even closely related to the Meliphagidae but instead belong to a group within the Passerida that includes the waxwings and the palmchat; they appear especially close to the silky-flycatchers. Hawaiian honeyeaters did not evolve from the similar looking Australasian honeyeaters, but instead represent a striking case of convergent evolution.

History Fox Sports Tennessee logo, used from 2008 to 2012. Fox Sports Tennessee launched on October 31, 2008, and was created through the separation of Fox Sports South into three regional networks: alongside the main Fox Sports South channel (originating from Atlanta, Georgia) and Fox Sports Carolinas, the latter of which launch on the same date as Fox Sports Tennessee. In July 2013, News Corporation spun off the Fox Sports Networks and most of its other U.S. entertainment properties into 21st Century Fox. On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Tennessee. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Holdings) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019. Programming Fox Sports Tennessee holds the regional cable television rights to the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA and the Nashville Predators of the NHL. It also carries simulcasts of Major League Baseball games, carrying Cincinnati Reds games televised by Fox Sports Ohio, St. Louis Cardinals games televised by Fox Sports Midwest and (within Tennessee) Atlanta Braves games televised by Fox Sports South, as well as coverage of collegiate sports events from the Southeastern Conference.

The journal covers geology, mining, formation, composition, methods of processing, combustion, economics, and environmental protection related to oil shale. It is abstracted and indexed in the Science Citation Index. The editor-in-chief is Anto Raukas. History The plan for publishing an oil shale journal arose in 1983 in the Estonian Academy of Sciences and the journal was established in 1984 as the journal of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Publishing was financed by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and administered by the Institute of Chemistry of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. It was published by the publishing house Perioodika in Tallinn. At first, the journal was published in Russian under the name –ì–æ—Ä—é—á–∏–µ –°–ª–∞–Ω—Ü—ã (translit. Goryutchie Slantsy). However, there was the permission from Soviet authorities to use the English-written subtitle Oil Shale and to add English summaries to Russian papers. The first editor-in-chief was Ilmar √ñpik. The financing by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR ended in the beginning of 1990s after Estonia regained independence. As of result, a new editorial board was selected, which decided to reform the journal into an international English-language journal. The publishing was mainly sponsored by oil shale companies and private persons. In 1994, the journal was indexed in ISI products and since then published by the Estonian Academy Publishers. Since 1998, the publishing is financed through Estonia's state budget.

She was the only daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo and his wife, whose name and origins are unknown; her brother, W≈Çadys≈Çaw the White, was later a candidate for the Polish throne. By 1323, King Charles I of Hungary wanted to increase influence over Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia. He offered Stephan the hand of Elizabeth, the relative of his own Piast wife Elizabeth. By marrying Elizabeth of Kuyavia, Stephen received from Charles the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Vladislav, King of Syrmia. The marriage was celebrated by 1339. Up to 1339, Stephan was married to an unknown Bulgarian princess. The only child which can be attributed to Elizabeth of Kuyavia without doubt is Elizabeth of Bosnia, born c. 1340. Some believe that Catherine of Bosnia, Countess of Cilli, was daughter of Elizabeth of Kuyavia and Stephen II, while others argue that Catherine was daughter of Stephen II's brother Vladislaus and his wife Jelena ≈†ubiƒá. Elizabeth may have also had a son, Vuk who may have survived infancy but he did not outlive his father so never became Ban of Bosnia. Vuk may have been the son of one of Stephen's previous two wives. Stephen outlived Elizabeth. It is unknown what Elizabeth died of. Judging by the time, it is possible that she died of Black Death, which was sweeping across Europe during the 14th century. Banness Elizabeth was buried in Bobovac in a tomb which she shared with her husband, brother-in-law Vladislaus and sister-in-law Jelena.Mandiƒá, Doninik: Franjevaƒçka Bosna: razvoj i uprava Bosanske vikarije i provincije, 1340-1735, Hrvatski povijesni institut, 1968, page 231.

Horton 46 Cal.4th 364, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 591, 207 P.3d 48, was the consolidation of three lawsuits following the passage of California's Proposition 8 on November 4, 2008, which went into effect on November 5. The suits were filed by a number of gay couples and governmental entities. Three of these six were accepted by the Supreme Court of California to be heard together. The oral arguments were made in San Francisco on March 5, 2009. These cases were new to the California Supreme Court, and Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar stated that it will set precedent as \\"no previous case had presented the question of whether an initiative could be used to take away fundamental rights\\". The court rendered its decision on May 26, 2009. The ruling established that Proposition 8 was valid as voted, but that marriages performed before it went into effect would remain valid. On June 26, 2013, Strauss v. Horton was mooted by Hollingsworth v. Perry.http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/26/19151971-supreme-court- strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act-paves-way-for-gay-marriage-to-resume-in- california?lite Background On November 13, 2008, the California Supreme Court asked state Attorney General Jerry Brown to reply by November 17, 2008, to a number of lawsuits challenging the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. The filing the court requested from the Attorney General was not to address the ballot measure's validity, but to focus on whether the justices should accept the suits for review and whether Proposition 8 should be suspended while they decide the case, said Christopher Krueger, a senior assistant attorney general. On November 17, 2008, the Attorney General urged the court to hear these cases in order to decide the important legal issues presented, but also argued that the court should not suspend Proposition 8. On November 19, 2008, the California Supreme Court accepted three lawsuits (Strauss et al. v. Horton, Tyler et al. v. State of California et al., and City and County of San Francisco et al. v. Horton et al.) challenging Proposition 8 and said that it would hear the cases together, but denied the requests to stay its enforcement. Three additional lawsuits (Asian Pacific American Legal Center et al. v. Horton et al., Equal Rights Advocates and California Women's Law Center v. Horton et al., and California Council of Churches et al. v. Horton et al.) on the matter were denied hearing, but those petitioners were invited by the court to file amicus briefs in the cases which were accepted. IssuesWhether Proposition 8 is a revision= A crowd of onlookers watch the jumbo screen as Justice Carlos R. Moreno, the sole dissenting justice, asks questions. The lawsuits claimed that revoking the right of same-sex couples to marry is a constitutional revision rather than an amendment. In California, both constitutional amendments and revisions require that a majority of voters approve the ballot initiative. However, a revision, defined as a \\"substantial alteration of the entire constitution rather than to a less extensive change in one or more of its provisions,\\" also requires the prior approval of 2/3 of each house of the California State Legislature. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine, stated, \\"the California Supreme Court has never articulated criteria for what makes something an amendment versus a revision. So I don't think you can predict anything because there is so little law.\\" Claims made on similar grounds with respect to other constitutional changes have in some cases taken years to be adjudicated, and almost all have failed. Kenji Yoshino, an openly gay man who serves as the Chief Justice Earl Warren Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University School of Law, cast doubt on the \\"revision\\" argument, stating that \\"for both precedential and political reasons, I think this case is a loser.\\" =Whether Proposition 8 violates separation of powers= Like the United States Constitution, the California Constitution employs the concept of separation of powers. The lawsuits argue that the protection of minority groups via the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is inherently a judiciary function, which cannot be overturned by the legislative branch of government, and therefore cannot be overturned by the initiative-amendment process. =Whether Proposition 8 invalidates existing marriages= A pending legal issue was whether the approximately 18,000 same- sex marriages already in effect would be retroactively annulled by the constitutional change or whether they would be preserved, since the amendment does not state explicitly that it would nullify same-sex marriages performed before the change took effect. California Attorney General Jerry Brown said that existing same-sex marriages would be unaffected, but other legal experts were uncertain. On December 19, 2008, supporters of Prop. 8 filed briefs responding to each of the anti-Prop. 8 lawsuits already filed with the State Supreme Court and seeking to nullify same-sex marriages already in effect. =Whether voters can override inalienable rights= The Attorney General's response to the lawsuits included a new argument that the Court should overturn Proposition 8. That brief contends that California's initiative- amendment process does not give voters the right to overturn rights in California's Declaration of Rights without a \\"compelling justification\\". Involved partiesPetitioners= Plaintiffs in the three lawsuits included same-sex couples who had married or planned to marry, represented by the same legal team that argued and won In re Marriage Cases, Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the ACLU of Northern California, as well as the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the county of Santa Clara. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to join the lawsuit filed by the City of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Santa Clara County, the four becoming the first governmental entities in the United States to sue for marriage equality for homosexual couples. This lawsuit was subsequently joined by Alameda, Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, and the cities of Fremont, Laguna Beach, Oakland, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Santa Monica and Sebastopol. The petitioners were represented by San Francisco City Attorney Therese M. Stewart. =Respondents= As the respondents in these cases were the State of California and some of its officials in their official capacity, California Attorney General Jerry Brown and his office were the primary individuals charged with responding to the lawsuit. Other respondents include Mark B. Horton of the State Registrar of Vital Statistics and Linette Scott of the California Department of Public Health. On December 19, 2008, the Attorney General's office filed its response, whose final section supported overturning Proposition 8. The brief argued that: # Although Proposition 8 should not be overturned on the grounds of revision/amendment analysis or on separation-of-power grounds as proposed in the original lawsuits, # Proposition 8 should not, if upheld, overturn existing same-sex marriages performed in California, and # Proposition 8 should be \\"stricken as inconsistent with the guarantees of individual liberty safeguarded by article I, section 1 of the Constitution.\\" In discussing the last section of the answer brief, the Attorney General explained, \\"Proposition 8 violates constitutionally protected liberties. There are certain rights that are not to be subject to popular votes, otherwise they are not fundamental rights. If every fundamental liberty can be stripped away by a majority vote, then it's not a fundamental liberty.\\" According to the San Jose Mercury News, Brown's argument for overturning Proposition 8 left Proposition 8 supporters legally isolated because the Attorney General would normally defend existing state laws. Brown responded to this noting that the California Constitution also constitutes existing state law. =Intervenors= ProtectMarriage.com, the sponsors of Proposition 8, asked for permission to intervene in the cases. On November 19, 2008, the Court granted permission for them to do so. The Campaign for California Families, a conservative religious organization, also asked the court for permission to become an official party to all three cases. The group unsuccessfully sought to place a same-sex marriage ban on the November ballot that also would have denied domestic partner benefits to same- sex couples.California Secretary of State - Elections & Voter Information - Initiative Update - Failed Initiatives Represented by the Florida-based Liberty Counsel, the Campaign said in its motion to intervene that state officials would not adequately defend the rights of voters. On November 19, 2008, the Court denied permission for CCF to intervene in the cases. On December 19, 2008, the official proponents of Proposition 8 filed briefs responding to each of the anti-Prop. 8 lawsuits already filed with the court, seeking to uphold the validity of Proposition 8 against the lawsuits and nullify same-sex marriages already in effect. Kenneth Starr, dean of Pepperdine University School of Law and investigator of the suicide of Vince Foster and Whitewater controversy, joined the Proposition 8 legal defence team that same day. =Amici= By January 19, 2009, sixty amicus curiae letters had been sent to the Court and posted on the Court's web site, 43 in opposition to all or part of Proposition 8, 17 in support. Forty-four members of the California Legislature (about one-third of its membership) filed an amicus curiae brief in support of one of the three lawsuits. The Anti- Defamation League, the Bar Association of San Francisco, and three other legal or civil rights groups also submitted letters supporting efforts to get the court to delay implementation of Proposition 8. Oral arguments Pro and Anti-Proposition 8 protesters clash at a rally in front of San Francisco City Hall. Oral arguments took place on March 5, 2009, at the Supreme Court's headquarters in San Francisco, while thousands from both sides protested outside. A television screen had been set up, displaying live shots from the proceedings within the court. Kenneth Starr, lawyer for ProtectMarriage.com, argued that \\"Prop. 8 was a modest measure that left the rights of same-sex couples undisturbed under California's domestic-partner laws and other statutes banning discrimination based on sexual orientation,\\" to the agreement of most of the judges. Chief Justice Ronald M. George, however, said, \\"It is just too easy to amend the California Constitution.\\" Starr's argument was challenged in and out of court by two members of his own faculty who argued the court had an obligation to secure both equality and religious freedom, and majorities cannot assume to have the power to deprive minorities of fundamental rights. The main issue which arose during the oral argument included the meaning of the word \\"inalienable\\", and to which extent this word goes when used in Article I of the Californian Constitution. Christopher Krueger of the Attorney General's office said that inalienable rights may not be stripped away by the initiative process. Those claims were rebuffed by Attorney Kenneth Starr, who said, \\"rights are important, but they don't go to structure. ... rights are ultimately defined by the people.\\" Decision The Supreme Court reported on May 22 that it would reach a verdict on the validity of Proposition 8 and the 18,000 same-sex marriages in question on Tuesday, May 26 at 10:00am. Because of the Memorial Day holiday, the court released its opinion on a Tuesday instead of Monday, as is traditional. =Majority opinion= On May 26, 2009 the California Supreme Court reported its decision on the validity of Proposition 8 and the 18,000 same-sex marriages in question. The proposition was upheld, but existing marriages were allowed to stand. Both the majority and Justice Werdegard emphasized that the ruling applied specifically to the use of the designation \\"Marriage\\", and that the ruling left the domestic partnership institution as well as several protections from In re Marriage Cases completely unaffected. The majority opinion stated:\\"Q&A;: Answering your questions about the Prop. 8 decision\\", Los Angeles Times Blog (May 26, 2009). > The Attorney General's contention ... rests inaccurately upon an > overstatement of the effect of Proposition 8 on both the fundamental > constitutional right of privacy guaranteed by article I, section 1, and on > the due process and equal protection guarantees of article I, section 7. As > explained below, Proposition 8 does not abrogate any of these state > constitutional rights, but instead carves out a narrow exception applicable > only to access to the designation of the term \\"marriage,\\" but not to any > other of \\"the core set of basic substantive legal rights and attributes > traditionally associated with marriage . . . The majority also noted that \\"Proposition 8 must be understood as creating a limited exception to the state equal protection clause.\\" =Concurrence= Justices Kennard and Werdegar filed concurring opinions. Kennard noted primarily that whereas \\"interpretation\\" of the law is a Judicial power, \\"alteration\\" is not, and as the proposal altered the language to be interpreted, it could not possibly violate the separation of powers. Werdegar considered that much of the argumentation of the majority regarding the difference between a \\"revision\\" and an \\"amendment\\" was flawed, expressing specific concern that the ruling \\"gives the foundational principles of social organization in free societies, such as equal protection, less protection from hasty, unconsidered change than principles of governmental organization.\\" =Dissent= Justice Moreno's dissent agreed with the petitioners' contention that \\"requiring discrimination against a minority group on the basis of a suspect classification strikes at the core of the promise of equality that underlies our California Constitution\\" and thus should be considered a revision. Citing Varnum v. Brien, Moreno stated that \\"equal protection principles lie at the core of the California Constitution and have been embodied in that document from its inception,\\" and that \\"As a logical matter, [the equal protection clause] cannot depend on the will of the majority for its enforcement, for it is the will of the majority against which the equal protection clause is designed to protect.\\" He concurred with the majority over the fact that the 18,000 valid marriages before Proposition 8 would remain (thus, Proposition 8 is not retroactive), as well as concurring with the majority opinion that \\"Proposition 8 does not entirely repeal or abrogate a same-sex couple's substantive state constitutional right to marry as set forth in the Marriage Cases.\\" Despite this, he dissented on the major question at issue and stated that Proposition 8 was indeed a constitutional revision that required a two-thirds legislative vote, citing article 18 of the California Constitution and the history of the constitutional provisions for amendments and revisions. Demonstrations and events Protestors at the \\"Day of Decision\\" rally marched up Market St in downtown San Francisco following the Supreme Court ruling. While oral arguments were ongoing within the court house in San Francisco, protests took place outside, with both sides sharing their views. On March 2, 2009, the California State Senate passed a resolution opposing Proposition 8, saying that \\"the initiative is a fundamental revision to the document, not an amendment, and therefore required deliberation by the Legislature and a two-thirds vote of both houses to put it on the ballot.\\" The California State Assembly passed an essentially identical resolution the same day. On May 8, a \\"Meet in the Middle\\" march and rally took place in Fresno in an effort to sway Central California voters to support same-sex marriage, because they had \\"voted overwhelmingly for the ban\\". \\"Day of Decision\\" protests or celebrations by supporters of same-sex marriage were planned for the evening of May 26, 2009, following the scheduled release of the Supreme Court decision; these events will take place across California, as well as in major cities in the United States and Canada. San Francisco City Attorney, Dennis Herrera, said that while it he was disappointed by the court's decision, it shows that the final round \\"could not be won in the legal arena\\". He vowed to fight in the ballot box in 2010. Proposition 8 supporters also planned to respond to the court ruling with public gatherings; Fresno pastor Jim Franklin, a leading opponent of same-sex marriage, opined that \\"if it were to go against the people, then there really should be rioting in the streets.\\"\\"Prop 8 Opponents, Supporters Wait for Supreme Court Decision\\", By Amanda Perez, KFSN-Fresno/Channel 30, Monday, May 25, 2009 See also *Perry v.

The world of Carnatic music knows them as the star duo of the twentieth century. They learnt under Alathur Venkatesa Iyer, the father of Sivasubramania Iyer. They were not brothers by birth but were rather bound by the brotherhood of music. They gave their first concert at Thyagaraja Aradhana festival in Thiruvaiyaru in 1928. Following the grand tradition set by their guru, the duo excelled in the authentic version of Carnatic music bringing together its technicalities to develop a taste for this patantara in the audience, both the experts and the laymen, alike. Combining the strengths of various aspects of Carnatic music, they established a style of music for themselves. Their music was the result of arduous training, conscious evolution of the Lakshya and Lakshana aspects, unique to Carnatic music and inspiration drawn from many a colossus of bygone era in Carnatic music. Known to the world to have presented many a complicate \\"pallavi\\" replete with all its mathematical permutations and combinations of usages, they had mastered \\"Laya\\" at a young age, imbibing the art from their Guru. Not many know though that another stalwart of Carnatic music, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer had once commented that the kind of \\"Jeevan\\" or life the brothers enthused in the very same compositions others sang on the concert platform was hard to enunciate and almost incomparable. The finesse and authority with which they handled compositions like Vidulaku Mrokeda (Mayamalavagowla, Tyagaraja), Mari Mari Ninne (Kambhoji, Tyagaraja), Epapamu (Atana, Tyagaraja), Shantamu Lekha (Sama, Tyagaraja), Kalinarula (Kuntalavarali, Tyagaraja), Koniyadina (Kambhoji, Veena Kuppaiyer), Shree Matha Shiva (Begada, Muthuswami Dikshitar), Kanulara Kanti (Danyasi, Wallajahpet Venkatramana Bhagavatar) were essays into the very depths of the most authentic of Carnatic music. Compositions in Tamil like Sivanai Ninaindhavar (Hindolam, Kavikunjara Bharathi) sparkled in their exposition. Exclusive Tiruppugazh concerts were a regular with them. The Alathur brothers performed with most of the star accompanists of the world of Carnatic music. On the violin, earlier they were accompanied by Thiruvalangadu Sundaresa Iyer, Mayavaram V. R. Govindaraja Pillai, Kumbakonam Rajamanickam Pillai, Mysore T. Chowdiah among others. Later T. N. Krishnan and Lalgudi G. Jayaraman accompanied them in most of their concerts while Kandadevi Azhagirisami accompanied them in a few. In the earliest of their concerts, mostly in and around Tiruchirapalli, the veteran mridangam exponent, Pudukottai Dakshinamoorthy Pillai accompanied them. It was he who introduced Pazhani Subramania Pillai, son of Pazhani Muthiah Pillai, himself a close friend of Alathur Venkatesa Iyer, to them. Their regular concerts in Tanjore and later in Madras had brought to them the Mridangam maestro Palghat Mani Iyer. From then onwards their concerts were either with Pazhani Subramania Pillai on the mridangam or an incomparable combination of Mani Iyer on the mridangam and Pillai on the Kanjira. It is said that the brothers were at their peak form essaying mind-boggling Pallavis with Lalgudi Jayaraman on the violin to provide answer to their exulting calculations and Mani Iyer and Pillai to take it further on to a different plane altogether with their solo versions, Thaniavardhanam. From 1944 to 1968 the brothers were the court musicians for the Maharajah of Travancore.

Erection of the building at Wilhelmplatz No. 7/8 began in 1737 as the residence of the Prussian Major General Karl Ludwig, Count of Waldburg-Capustigall, who died the next year. By command of King Frederick William I of Prussia, the palace was finished by the Order of Saint John (the Johanniterorden) according to plans by Carl Friedrich Richter, who also designed the neighbouring Palais Schulenburg (later the German Reich Chancellery). From 1738, the palace was the principal residence of the Herrenmeister (\\"Master of the Knights\\"), chief of the Order, and housed the Berlin legation of the Order. The palace later was renamed for Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia, who was Herrenmeister from 1763 to 1811. The Ordenspalais in 1936 Ruins of the Ordenspalais in March, 1945 The Kingdom of Prussia took over the building in 1811, upon the dissolution of the Order by a government desperate for funds in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, and the building thereafter housed several governmental agencies before Prince Charles of Prussia made it his residence in 1829. He had the palace remodeled in a Neoclassical style according to plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, with an annex built by Friedrich August St√ºler. In 1853, the building, now numbered Wilhelmplatz No. 8/9, saw the solemn restoration of the Johanniterorden and Prince Charles's installation as the new Herrenmeister. After his death in 1883, the palace remained the residence of Prince Charles's descendants Princes Frederick Charles and Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. After World War I and the fall of the Prussian monarchy, the palace became the subject of a lengthy lawsuit between the House of Hohenzollern and the Free State of Prussia. The palace remained empty until the German government made it the offices of the united press department of the Reichsregierung and the Foreign Office, which held daily press conferences here. In March 1933, the building became the headquarters of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda led by Joseph Goebbels. During his tenure, the building was again enlarged, with St√ºler's annex extended and rebuilt until 1940. The Ordenspalais itself was destroyed in the last months of World War II. The annex, renumbered Wilhelmstra√üe No. 49, survived and from 1947 was the seat of the East German National Front organization. Since 1999, the building has held the main offices of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

Description  Mimetes hirtus is an evergreen, well-branched, upright shrub of 1¬Ω‚Äì2 m (5‚Äì6¬Ω ft) high, that develops from a single trunk of up to 7¬Ω cm (3 in) thick, covered with a sooth red bark. The stiffly upright branches are initially covered in dense felty or woolly hairs, but these soon wear off. The leaves are set alternately along the branches, at an upward angle and overlapping. They have a lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped outline, are 2¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω cm (1.0‚Äì1.8 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì1¬æ cm (0.2‚Äì0.7 in) wide, with a pointy thickened tip, and initially carry some felty hairs and a row of felty hairs along the entire margin, which later wear off. The inflorescences are broadly cylinder-shaped, 8‚Äì14 cm (3¬º‚Äì5¬æ in) long and 8‚Äì9 cm (3¬º‚Äì3¬Ω in) in diameter, with a tuft of smaller, pinkish, not very upright leaves. It consists of up to fourteen flower head that each contain nine to fourteen individual flowers and sit in the axil of an ordinary flat green leaf. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are bright yellow with red tips, pointy lance-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (0.6‚Äì1.6 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì1¬º cm (0.2‚Äì0.5 in) wide, papery in consistency, mostly hairless but sometime with a few silky hairs, the margins towards the tip with a row of silky hairs, and are tightly enveloping the flowers. The inner bracts are narrowly lance-shaped with a pointy tip, sickle-shaped, thinly papery in consistency, 2‚Äì4 cm (0.8‚Äì1.6 in) long and 4‚Äì6 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) wide, slightly silky hairy along the margins. The bract subtending the individual flower is line- to awl-shaped, 5‚Äì8 mm (0.20‚Äì0.32 in) long and about 1 mm (0.04 in) wide, hairless except for a row of minute hairs along the edges. The 4-merous perianth is 3‚Äì4 cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long and straight. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is squared in cross-section, hairless and about ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) long. The segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped, slightly powdery hairy near the base and silky hairy towards the top. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are line-shaped with a pointy tip in outline, boat- shaped, and covered in silky hairs. The four anthers lack a filament and each is directly merged with ome of the limbs. From the centre of the perianth emerges a red-coloured style of 5‚Äì5¬Ω cm (2.0‚Äì2.2 in) long that is slightly bent. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is about 4 mm (0.16 in) long, has a ring-shaped thickening at its base and the groove that functions as the stigma sits across the very tip. The ovary is egg-shaped, minutely powdery and about 2 mm long (0.04 in). It is subtended by four fleshy, blunt, rounded rectangular scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The ovary will develop into a cylindric fruit of 6‚Äì7 mm (0.24‚Äì0.28 in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 mm (0.06‚Äì0.08 in) wide.  Taxonomy  The oldest known reference to the marsh pagoda was made by Herman Boerhaave, who described it as lepidocarpodendron; foliis sericeis brevibus confertissime natis, fructu gracile longo [tree with scaled fruits, short leaves silky, initially cropped, long graceful fruits] in 1720. Carl Linnaeus gave the marsh pagoda the first proper binominal Leucadendron hirtum in 1760. When in 1771, he decided to collapse Mimetes into Protea he created the new combination Protea hirta. Richard Anthony Salisbury in a book by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, published in 1809, reassigned the marsh pagoda to his newly created genus Mimetes, creating the name Mimetes hirtus. = Naming = Mimetes hirtus is variously known as marsh pagoda, tall pagoda, red and yellow bottlebrush, hairy mimetes, or pineapple bush in English and vleistompie or pynappelstompie in Afrikaans. The species name hirtus is a Latin word meaning roughly hairy, because its hairiness contrasts with the glabrous species M. cucullatus.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The marsh pagoda is an endemic species that grows along the foot of the coastal mountains on the southern coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa. In the west, it grows in the wild on the Cape Peninsula, between Buffelsbaai and Silvermine Nature Reserve. Previously however, it could be found as far north as Rondebosch. Further east, it can be found from Hangklip near Pringle Bay, along the foot of the Kogelberg Nature Reserve at Betty's Bay and Kleinmond, Hermanus, and the southern foot of the hills towards Elim, where it reaches its southeastern limit. It seldomly grows at an altitude exceeding 50 m (165 ft), except for the populations Silvermine and Highlands that occur at about 400 m (1300 ft) elevation. The marsh pagoda prefers a swampy habitat or the bank of streams, where it may form dense stands and forms a vegetation together with species such as Osmitopsis asteriscoides, Erica perspicua and Psoralea aphylla. Like other Mimetes species, the marsh pagoda is adapted to pollination by birds, in this case in particular the Cape sugarbird. This species sits on top of the inflorescence and brushes against the pollen presenters. Visits of the orange-breasted sunbird are less effective because this species sits below the inflorescence and so largely avoids the pollen presenters. After the fruits have fallen, native ants collect these and carry them to their underground nests. Here, they eat the elaiosome, and the hard grey seeds remain protected against being eaten and fire, until they germinate after an overhead fire and subsequent rains. Like most shrubs in its habitat, the marsh pagoda is short-lived. They initially grow vigorously, and may often start flowering already in their second year. It continues growing and flowering profusely until around fifteen years, old age sets in.  Conservation  The marsh pagoda is considered a vulnerable species because, although it has a considerable distribution, its habitat has been reduced by at least 50% due to agriculture and urban development, and is projected to decline further.

He has been out of office since the assassination attempt on him on 3 December 2009. Early and personal life Moussa Dadis Camara was born in 1964 in the remote town of Koul√©, Nz√©r√©kor√© Prefecture, in the Guin√©e Foresti√®re region of southeastern Guinea, near the border with C√¥te d'Ivoire and Liberia. He is a member of the Kpelle ethnic group (known in Guinea as Guerze). Dadis attended primary and secondary school in Nz√©r√©kor√©, about 24 miles (40 km) away from his birth-town of Koul√©. He studied law and economics at Abdel Nasser University in the capital, Conakry. He joined the Army of Guinea in 1990 as a corporal and was later appointed as the Chief of Fuels at the Guinean army base in Kindia, about 60 miles northeast of Conakry. From 2001 to 2002, Dadis was sent to Sierra Leone as a member of the United Nations' peacekeeping troops. In 2004, President Cont√© sent Dadis, along with several other Guinean soldiers, to Bremen, Germany, for 18 months‚Äô military training. In November 2008, he was named head of the Guinean army's fuel supplies unit, a branch of the Guinean Minister of Defense's cabinet. He was one of the leading mutineers in the 2008 Guinean military unrest. Prior to the December 2008 coup, he was not well known by the general population.\\"Guinea coup leader says unions can help choose PM\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 27 December 2008.

According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly was to assume the Presidency of the Republic in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election was to be held within 60 days. Six hours after Sompar√© announced Cont√©'s death, a statement was read on television announcing a military coup d'√©tat.\\"Military-led group announces coup in Guinea\\", Associated Press, 23 December 2008.

According to Camara, the coup was necessary because of Guinea's \\"deep despair\\" amidst rampant poverty and corruption, and he said that the existing institutions were \\"incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country.\\" Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as prime minister at the head of a new government that would be ethnically balanced. The National Council for Democracy and Development would, according to Camara, include 26 officers as well as six civilians.\\"Coup attempt in Guinea after president dies\\", AFP, 23 December 2008.

Later in the day, Camara and thousands of soldiers loyal to him paraded through the city, surrounded by large numbers of civilian supporters. According to Camara, he \\"came to see if the terrain is favorable to us\\", declaring that the large crowds indicated that the people were indeed supportive of the coup. Also on 24 December, Camara said in a radio broadcast that the CNDD did not want to stay in power indefinitely and that it intended to lead the country for two years, promising \\"credible and transparent presidential elections by the end of December 2010\\". This contradicted an earlier statement which promised an election within the constitutionally mandated period of 60 days.\\"Guinea coup leader parades through capital\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 25 December 2008. Speaking on the radio on 25 December, Camara said that he did not plan to run for president at the end of the two-year transitional period. He also declared that the CNDD was not susceptible to bribes. According to Camara, people had \\"start[ed] to show up with bags of money to try to corrupt us.

Although many branches of security forces were involved, the presidential guard \\"Red Berets\\", led by Abubakar \\"Toumba\\" Diakite, were responsible for the violence, firing on, knifing, bayonetting, and gang-raping the fleeing civilians, killing at least 157 people (U.N) and injuring at least 1,200 not just in the stadium but as many fled on streets. In response to criticism from international human rights organisations, the government has said that only 56 people died and most were trampled by fleeing protesters. Following the event, cell phone photos from anonymous sources circulated on the Internet, showing what appears to be many women being raped by Camara's soldiers. Few women have spoken up about the attacks against them because of a societal stigma against the victims of sexual assault. However, Doctors Without Borders has confirmed that they have treated several rape and sexual violence victims of the incident. For a people already accustomed to violence, the rapes were nonetheless especially shocking as they took place in the open space, under broad daylight, and were horrifically violent and often mortal. According to numerous witness accounts, women were horrendously gang-raped using gun barrels and other objects. Some were raped then shot with the rifle barrel in their vaginas. The International Criminal Court is currently investigating the incident and the African Union asked for Camara's resignation. In response to the incident, the Economic Community of West African States imposed an arms embargo on Guinea.\\"France welcomes arms embargo on Guinea\\". Reuters. The African Union, the European Union and the United States punished Moussa Dadis Camara and forty-one other junta members in late October 2009. The African Union imposed a travel ban and froze any bank accounts owned by the forty-two. The European Union did the same a day earlier. The United States opted for a travel ban alone. The African Union's commissioner for peace and security said the sanctions were intended to punish the junta and would not affect areas such as trade which may impact on the lives of ordinary citizens.  Assassination attempt  On 3 December 2009, Camara was shot by men under the command of his aide-de-camp, Abubakar \\"Toumba\\" Diakite. A government spokesman (Idrissa Cherif) said he was only lightly wounded, but anonymous junta officials said Camara was in a serious condition after being shot in the head. Camara's bodyguard and driver were killed in the attack.Guinea vice-president returns after assassination bid, BBC On 4 December the New York Times's sources suggested that Camara had in fact left the country for medical treatment in Morocco, amidst claims by officials that he was not in serious condition.

Nineteenth-century graveyards sometimes included carved chairs for the comfort of visitors. In this function, the object was known as a \\"mourning chair,\\" and cemeteries have since provided benches for similar purposes, most often movable units of the type used in parks, but also specimens in the tradition of the carved chairs. Some carved chairs were probably not intended for use as anything but monuments, while the \\"monubench\\" is still commercially available. Once the original purpose of these chairs fell out of fashion, superstitions developed in association with the act of sitting in them. In a typical example, local young people dare one another to visit the site, most often after dark, at midnight, or on some specified night such as Halloween or New Year‚Äôs Eve. Variously, the stories suggest the person brave enough to sit in the chair at such a time may be punished for impudence or rewarded for courage. The Baird Chair monument in Kirksville, Missouri  Ulverston, Cumbria, England  The Devil's Chair or Devil's Armchair in Ulverston is an ambiguous chair that appears to have been carved into a small rocky terrain, which is used for climbing, near the monument Hoad in Ulverston. Sometimes the rock 'wall' itself is referred to as the Devil's Armchair but that is because at the top there is a \\"chair\\" large enough for four adults to sit in which is carved into the rock surface. Naturally or not, no-one knows.  Shropshire Hills, England  The devil's chair here is a natural large craggy outcrop on the summit of the Stiperstones, a narrow north to south orientated ridge of the highest ground of the range, the Shropshire Hills AONB.  Florida  The Devil's Chair in Cassadaga, Florida is a graveside bench in the cemetery that borders Cassadaga and Lake Helen. According to one local legend, an unopened can of beer left on the chair will be empty by morning. In some accounts, the can is opened, and in others, the beer is simply gone, through the unopened top. The Devil is sometimes said to appear to anyone so bold as to sit in the chair.  Illinois  The Haunted Chair of Greenwood Cemetery, Decatur, IL.  Iowa  The Devil's Chair in Guthrie Center, Iowa, is a cement-cast chair located in Union Cemetery, situated between two graves and unmarked as belonging to either. Local legend claims that bad luck will follow anyone who sits in it. While the cemetery itself was established as a private burial ground in 1885, the legend of the chair is only documented for approximately thirty years.  Missouri  The Devil's Chair or Baird Chair as it is officially named in the Highland Park Cemetery of Kirksville, Missouri was first placed in the cemetery by Charles Grassle and David Baird when David's wife, Anna Maria (Hoye) Baird, died in 1911. It has become involved in \\"numerous legends of a type widely replicated across the U.S., especially in rural and small-town communities, and beloved of young people.... Some versions say that something dreadful will happen to the person so bold as to be seated in it at midnight (or on a particular evening, such as Halloween) -- a hand will emerge from the grave and drag the impious one down to the underworld. Other versions suggest the intrepid one will be rewarded.\\" The chair itself was sculpted out of concrete by Charles Grassle of the Baird and Grassle Granite Work of Kirksville MO and placed as a memorial for Anna in 1911. One year later David Baird died and was buried beside Anna.

The original map was heritage and walk based (although the first, more limited version appeared some years earlier concentrating on disability access to the River Wandle), but then a revised map was produced by Groundwork Merton to facilitate bicycle access. Organisation The Wandle Trail Group is now responsible for the promotion of the trail. The group consist of an association of the London Boroughs of Wandsworth, Merton and Sutton, together with Groundwork Merton (a charity to support the improvement of the quality of life for Londoners), and Sustrans (a charity for sustainable transport, especially cycling). Description The trail follows the river as far as possible by its banks. In some areas unsuitable for cycling, it divides into two trails: one for walkers, and the other which uses nearby roads for both cycle and walking. The Wandle runs through areas that are largely built-up. As public transport is available in the areas close by, access to the trail is easy at many points. Sections of the trail can be comfortably walked with stops for food and drink. Much of the trail uses existing Green Spaces (see below), each of which has its own attractions. There are some sections where the trail has to leave the river and use local roads. Schemes have been presented for future development that may overcome the obstacles by the river, but cost has so far prevented their implementation. The trail has been designated National Cycle Network Route 20, and also will be part of route 22. Facilities The trail starts at East Croydon Station and runs for about to the Thames near Wandsworth Town Station. The route passes near Earlsfield and Haydons Road railway stations, Colliers Wood and Morden underground stations and Phipps Bridge Tramlink stop. Many sections of the trail are suitable for wheelchair users and improvements have been proposed to extend these. In addition to the parks, the trail is adjacent to both Morden Hall (National Trust) and Merton Abbey Mills, which has a working waterwheel. There are several parts of the trail that are suitable for nature and ecological study, and some places where fishing is allowed. A description and map of the trail are in a pamphlet published by the group. It shows the location of bus stops, phones, seats, and toilets. It also shows places on the route where refreshments can be obtained.

Early life and career Whittingham was born in New York City, the son of Richard Whittingham and Mary Ann Rollinson Whittingham. He was educated at home, and later attended the General Theological Seminary, graduating in 1825. He received the degree of Doctor of Sacred Theology from Columbia University in 1827. Whittingham was ordained deacon on March 11, 1827 by the Bishop of New York John Henry Hobart in Trinity Church. He was then assigned to missionary work in northern New Jersey. While there, he married Hannah Harrison; the couple ultimately had two sons and two daughters.http://www.whittingham.eu/families/whittingham/William- Rollison-1805-%28New-York-USA%29.htm Whittingham was ordained priest on December 17, 1829 by the Bishop of New Jersey John Croes in St Mark's Church, Orange, New Jersey, which church he then became rector of. In 1831, he became the rector of St. Luke's, New York City, and remained there until 1836, when he accepted a professorship at the General Theological Seminary. Career as bishop In 1840, a diocesan convention elected Whittingham bishop of Maryland. On September 17 of that year in St. Paul's, Baltimore, bishops Alexander Viets Griswold, Richard Channing Moore, and Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk consecrated Whittingham, who thus became the 36th bishop of the Episcopal Church. Bishop Whittingham founded several charitable and educational institutions, including the College of St. James in Hagerstown, an infirmary in Baltimore, an order of deaconesses, and the Sisterhood of St. John in Washington, D.C. (then part of the diocese). He also became known for his solicitude toward African-Americans in his diocese, both from his support of St. James' First African Church in Baltimore, and for always setting aside the afternoons during his visitations within the diocese for meetings with and instructions for African Americans, some of whom were undoubtedly slaves.George Freeman Bragg, \\"The Whittingham Canon\\": The Birth and History of the Missionary District Plan (Church Advocate Press, Baltimore: 1913) at p. 1 200px At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, Whittingham advocated for the Union cause, and sent a letter of praise to Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks for refusing to convene a special legislative session concerning secession. This temporarily estranged him from the sympathies of many of his congregants. Many criticized him for intruding the church into affairs of state. Bishop Whittingham also brought several priests who refused to say prayers for the President before ecclesiastical tribunals, for failing to follow his orders. Until 1863, he refused to characterize himself as an abolitionist, merely a supporter of the joint and lawful decision of Congress and the Lincoln administration to restore the Union by force of arms. He also commended to his clergy the Lincoln administration's various calls for days of prayer or thanksgiving during the war, while offering parishioners alternate prayers, although a number of Southern-sympathizing still parishes refused to comply. pp, 226-234 Bishop Whittingham's evolving attitude may have helped him to work to unify the church when the war ended, since Bishop Davis of South Carolina and Bishop Elliott of Georgia consulted him after many African- Americans left the Episcopal Church in favor of \\"various colored denominations which came to birth at that time.\\"Bragg at p. 2 However, the diocese of Maryland also experienced considerable division and chaos during and after the war. Maryland Episcopalians served on both sides during the war, and considerable fighting occurred on Maryland soil, but Bishop Whittingham never visited a battlefield or hospital. His son, Dr. Edward T. Whittingham, for three years served as a Union Army surgeon in the eastern theater, first under General Philip Kearny of New Jersey, who died on September 1, 1862. As the war ended, ill-feeling remained, particularly against Union occupying forces and loyalty oaths (especially after a scandal concerning the Bishop's recommending they also be required of clergy). Because President Andrew Johnson first declared a day of mourning for his assassinated predecessor on May 25, the Feast of the Ascension in 1865, and then moved it to June 1, which would be the second day of the diocesan convention, Bishop Whittingham attempted to postpone the latter, but was initially defeated. Many delegates had stayed home, others selected an alternate date (13 September immediately before the Feast of the Holy Cross instead of September 27 as their bishop requested). In 1869 the Diocese of Easton, which had many Southern sympathizers, was set off from Maryland, and former Confederate bishop Henry C. Lay became its first bishop. In 1870 Reverend William Pinkney was appointed to assist Bishop Whittingham with his labors. In 1872 Whittingham represented the American church at the Lambeth conference, and he subsequently attended the meeting of Old Catholics at Bonn in a similar capacity. Furthermore, at the General Convention in 1874, Bishop Whittingham presented a plan for Missionary Districts staffed by African-American priests who could evangelize outside diocesan boundaries. Although Whittingham had formulated the plan based on his experience and correspondence with the bishops of South Carolina and Georgia, bishop Atkinson of North Carolina and bishop Williams of Connecticut opposed it, and it did not pass. However, African-American clergy resurrected the \\"Whittingham Canon\\" at the General Conventions in 1907, 1910 and 1913.Bragg at pp. 3-4, 9-10 Whittingham wrote and edited several books. He wrote the introduction and notes and was the editor of The Parish Library of Standard Works (13 vols., 1828 el seq.); Jahn's Introduction to the Old Testament with Dr. Samuel H. Turner (1827); William Palmer's Treatise on the Church of Christ (2 vols., 1841); the Commonitorium of Vincent of Larius: being a new translation with notes, etc. (1847); and Ratramm on the Lord's Supper (revised translation, 1848). Whittingham also contributed, with three other clergymen, to \\"Essays and Dissertations in Biblical Literature.\\" He also edited the Family Visitor and Children's Magazine (both monthly publications), and \\"The Churchman\\" (issued weekly). Bishop Whittingham also called for the preservation of church records in his diocese in 1855 and appointed Ethan Allen as the diocese's first historian, thus helping to gather early church records and publish Clergy in Maryland of the Protestant Episcopal church since the independence of 1783 in 1860. Bishop Whittingham was a high churchman, although he modified his opinions later in life, possibly in light of criticism of Anglo-Catholic practices as \\"popery.\\" Several controversies with his clergy on points of church government ensued. Reverend Dr. Joseph Trapnell, of St. Andrew's, argued with Bishop Whittingham concerning the prior episcopal right to celebrate communion at confirmations. During the Civil War, Whittingham rebuked some clergy for omitting the prayers for President Lincoln from services. Finally, in 1876 he was presented for not bringing to trial Joseph Richey, the rector of Mount Calvary Church (where he himself had served as rector), for reading prayers for the dead. Death and legacy For many years before his death, Whittingham was an invalid. His last official act was performed on November 7, 1878. At the time of his consecration he was the youngest of the American bishops: at his death he was the second-oldest, having been in office thirty-nine years. He died in Orange, New Jersey on October 17, 1879, and was buried at St. Stephens Episcopal Cemetery in Millburn, New Jersey. Project Canterbury published some of his sermons and letters online. The cornerstone of St. Katherine of Alexandria Episcopal Church in Baltimore mentions being consecrated in his memory.

History and text  The piece was initially thought to be an early work of Johann Sebastian Bach. However, Bach scholars reattributed the piece to his cousin, Johann Ludwig Bach. The piece was likely composed in Meiningen in 1704 for the first day of Eastertide, known as Easter Sunday. There is some evidence that it may have been performed again under the aegis of Johann Sebastian Bach on 21 April 1726 in Leipzig.

However, such form of the coat of arms has not been used by the Holy See for decades: in all official events and in the diplomatic missions of the Holy See abroad, it is always the regular Vatican City flag (with the gold key pointing upwards to the right and the silver key pointing upwards to the left) that is flown,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Nunciatura_apostolica_BSB_01.jpghttps://pamelaho.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/vatican- city-flag.jpghttp://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2009/05/dome-and- vatican- flag.jpghttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/USA_and_Vatican_flag.jpghttp://traditioninaction.org/religious/religiousimages/F017_WhiteHouse.jpg and the Vatican now only uses the Holy See's coat of arms in monochrome, which renders it in practice one and the same as the coat of arms of Vatican City. Origins and background Ecclesiastical heraldry had the same origin and developed contemporaneously with general heraldry, which had become general throughout England, France, Italy and Germany by the end of the 12th century. Ecclesiastical heraldry appears first in seals, nearly all vesica-shaped. Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in Catholic Encyclopedia (1910) = Keys and their arrangement = The earliest blazoning of the arms of the Holy See is that found in Froissart's Chronicles of 1353, which describes them as \\"gules two keys in saltire argent\\".\\"\\"Froissart, in his Chronicles referring to the events of the year 1383, is the first to blazon the arms of the Church: faisait Vevesque de Mordwich porter devant lui les armes de l'Eglise, la banni√®re de St. Pierre, de gueules √† deux clefs d'argent en sautoir, comme Gonfanonnier du Pape Urbain.\\" Donald Lindsay gules, A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry (W. Heffer and Sons, 1930) From the beginning of the 14th century, the arms of the Holy See had shown this arrangement of two crossed keys, most often with a gold key in bend and a silver in bend sinister, but sometimes with both keys or (gold), less often both keys silver, as described by Froissart.\\"From the beginning of the 14th century, the two crossed keys constitute the arms of the papacy. The field of the shield is generally gules (red) and the cord is azure (blue). Most often the key placed in bend is gold and the one placed in bend sinister is silver; sometimes they are both gold, or, less often, silver\\" (Michel Pastoureau, \\"Keys\\" in Philippe Levillain, The Papacy: An Encyclopedia (Routledge 2002 ), vol. 2, p. 891). The practice by which the gold key is placed in bend and the silver in bend sinister was slow in establishing itself, and only from the time of Pope Pius II is it found with certainty. \\"The practice of placing a gold key in bend over another in bend sinister of silver is not found with any certainty before the time of Pius II (1458‚Äì64).\\"John A. Goodall, \\"The Sovereign Pontiff has the oldest coat of arms\\" in The Catholic Herald, 1 June 1956 In 1952‚Äì1953 the English Heraldry Society gave the blazon of the arms of the Holy See as \\"Gules a key or [(\\"gold\\" in French)] in bend above a key argent [(\\"silver\\" in French)] in bend sinister, both wards upwards, the bows united by a cord or, above the shield a tiara, its three crowns or [(\\"gold\\")], the mitre argent [(\\"silver\\")].\\".The Heraldry Society, Coat of Arms 1952‚Äì53, vol. 2, p. 254 In his 1978 book, Heraldry in the Catholic Church, Archbishop Bruno Heim described the same arrangement. The arrangement of the keys in the Holy See's coat of arms as was described in these sources distinguished it from that of Vatican City State by a reversing of the gold and silver keys. However, the Holy See authorities have all but ceased to use the distinct coat of arms that theoretically represented the Holy See ‚Äì in all official events and including diplomatic missions of the Holy See abroad, it is always the regular Vatican City flag, with the golden key pointing upwards to the right (and the silver key pointing upwards to the left), that is flown. The Vatican itself now only uses the Holy See coat of arms in monochrome, which renders it in practice indistinguishable from the coat of arms of Vatican City. =Sede vacante= The sede vacante emblem The gold key is placed in bend also in the sede vacante emblem, with the tiara replaced by an umbraculum said to represent the absence of a pope and the temporary governance of the camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church over the temporal affairs of the Holy See, and in the arms of the Papal States = Tiara = By the end of Froissart's 14th century the papal tiara is included in the coat of arms of the Holy See according to Galbreath and . and Insegne e simboli: araldica pubblica e privata medievale e moderna.Giacomo C. Bascap√©, Marcello Del Piazzo, Luigi Borgia (editors), Insegne e simboli: araldica pubblica e privata medievale e moderna (Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali, Ufficio Centrale per i Beni Archivistici, 1983, ), p. 337 Claudio Ceresa, on the other hand, says the earliest known evidence of its adoption dates from the following century, in the pontificate of Martin V (1417‚Äì1431).Claudio Ceresa, \\"Una sintesi di simboli ispirati alla Scrittura\\" on L'Osservatore Romano, 10 August 2008 Papal States Federico III as Gonfalonier of the Church. The distinction between the coat of arms of the papacy and that of the territory ruled by it dates back at least to the 16th century. Galbreath states: \\"From the 16th century on, this, the third coat of the Papacy ‚Äî which may be blazoned Gules a pair of keys crossed in saltire, one gold, one silver, tied gold, surmounted by a tiara silver, crowned gold ‚Äî is taken to represent the Papacy as distinct from the Papal States.\\"Galbreath 1930, p. 25 This statement is quoted with approval by Heim.Heim 1978, p. 101 The arms of the Papal States differed in having the umbraculum (the emblem of the Pope's temporal powers) in place of the tiara, and were incorporated as the first quartering of the royal coat of arms of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy (1805‚Äì1814).Giacomo P. Bascap√®, Marcello Del Piazzo, Insegne e simboli. Araldica pubblica e privata medievale e moderna. Parte Terza: Araldica Napoleonica in Italia (Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali, 1983), p. 770 This coat of arms was not resumed for the territory over which the Pope's temporal powers were restored in 1929 with the creation of Vatican City State. The holder of the title of Gonfalonier of the Church was entitled to include in his own arms the same design of the crossed keys and umbraculum on a red field. Vatican City State The coat of arms of Vatican City State is officially described, under the heading \\"Annex B. Official coat of arms of Vatican City State\\", in article 20 of the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State in force since 22 February 2001, which repeats the contents of article 19 of the original Fundamental Law of Vatican City State adopted on 7 June 1929 with immediate effect. Each of these official documents includes an illustration of the coat of arms of the state accompanied by the words \\"Chiavi decussate sormontate dal triregno in campo rosso\\" (Crossed keys beneath the papal tiara on a red field) and is accompanied by an illustration that depicts the keys as two in number, one white (argent) in bend and one golden (or) in bend sinister, interlaced at their intersection with a red (gules) cord. The tiara is represented as white with golden crowns. Charges on the escutcheon Claudio Ceresa says that the oldest known representation of the crossed keys beneath the papal tiara dates from the pontificate of Martin V (1417‚Äì1431), whose successor, Eugene IV (1431‚Äì1447), included it in the design of a silver coin. Galbreath and Insegne e simboli: araldica pubblica e privata medievale e moderna say it is attested from the previous century. =The keys= The keys refer to the promise of Christ to Peter, \\"I will entrust to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you declare bound on earth shall be bound in heaven; whatever you declare loosed on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" They are a symbol of the power the Catholic Church believes that Christ gave to Saint Peter and his successors, with the gold key signifying that the power reaches to heaven and the silver key that it extends to all the faithful on earth, the interlacing indicating the linking between the two aspects of the power, and the handles of the key being at the base to symbolize the power being in the hands of the pope.\\"The symbolism of the keys is brought out in an ingenious and interpretative fashion by heraldic art. One of the keys is of gold (or), the other of silver (argent). The golden key, which points upwards on the dexter side, signifies the power that extends even to Heaven. The silver key, which must point up to the sinister side, symbolizes the power over all the faithful on earth. The two are often linked by a cordon Gules as a sign of the union of the two powers. The handles are turned downwards, for they are in the hand of the Pope, Christ's lieutenant on earth. The wards point upwards, for the power of binding and loosing engages Heaven itself.\\" Bruno Bernhard Heim, Heraldry in the Catholic Church: Its Origin, Customs and Laws (Van Duren 1978 ), p. 54 =The tiara= While actual wearing of the papal tiara has been discontinued by John Paul I and his successors, it remains a papal heraldic symbol. A crown was added to the headgear of the Pope in 1130 to symbolize sovereignty over the Papal States. In 1301, Boniface VIII, at that time in conflict with Philip IV of France, added a second crown to indicate that his spiritual authority was superior to any civil power. In 1342, Benedict XII added a third crown to symbolize the superiority of papal religious authority over that of non-religious monarchs. The original significance of the three crowns was lost over time and they came to represent instead the pope's powers as priest, ruler and teacher.

The newspaper is owned by Lee Enterprises. The Statesville Record & Landmark is the newspaper of record for Statesville and has been serving the city and Iredell County, North Carolina since June 19, 1874 when it was a weekly called the Landmark. It has been published seven days a week since 1920.Middlesworth, Chester Paul; NCPedia, 2006, History The first editor and publisher was John B. Hussey. Hussey sold the paper to J.Sherman Ramsey in 1877 but remained the editor. In 1880 Ramsey sold the paper to Joseph Pearson Caldwell, Jr., son of Joseph Pearson Caldwell, Sr.. Under Caldwell's leadership, the newspaper maintained a progressive editorial policy coupled with a fiscally conservative Democratic stance. In 1892, Caldwell sold half interest in the newspaper to Rufus Reid Clark, who had been on the staff of the newspaper and was a Mooresville native. The newspaper began twice weekly publication in 1895--Mondays and Thursdays. In 1905, Clark bought out Caldwell's share of the paper. In 1918, Pegram A. Bryant bought the newspaper. On September 1, 1920, Bryant began an additional publication, a daily version of the newspaper called the Statesville Daily. A competitor newspaper, The Statesville Record, began semiweekly publication in 1931. This newspaper had several owners until 1938 when Chester E. Middlesworth bought the paper and turned it into a daily publication in 1941. In 1948, this newspaper became the first North Carolina newspaper to utilize the new Fairchild scanning engraving system, which allowed the paper to be readied for publication within minutes rather than hours. In 1953, the Landmark and the Statesville Daily were purchased by the Statesville Daily Record and merged into one daily afternoon publication, the Statesville Record and Landmark. Park Communications bought the Statesville Record and Landmark in September 1979. Media General acquired Park Communications in 1997. In 2012, Media General sold the newspaper to Berkshire Hathaway.

Life Michael Bahouth was born in 1799 near Acre. In 1816 he entered in the Holy Saviour monastery of the Basilian Salvatorian Order and professed monastic vows in 1818. He was ordained priest in about 1824. Before 1826 he visited Rome. From 1826 to 1835 he was Melkite chaplain in Livorno, Italy.Korolevskij, DHGE, 6 (1932) On 10 August 1836on 29 July according to the Julian calendar he was consecrated bishop of Acre by patriarch Maximos III Mazloum, taking the name of Clement. At the death of patriarch Maximos III Mazloum, the synod of the Melkite Catholic bishops elected Clement Bahouth as patriarch on 1 April 1856. His election was supported by both the bishops partisans of Mazloum's line and by Archbishop Paolo Brunoni, a Chypriot who was the Apostolic Legate of Syria. The same electoral synod, having in mind the last authoritative years of Maximos Mazloum, issued decrees to limit the patriarchal authority. Clement Bahouth's election was confirmed by Pope Pius IX on 16 June 1856. Clement Bahouth was docile to the demand of Archbishop Paolo BrunoniFrazee (2006), p. 290 to Latinize the Eastern Catholic Churches. Without consulting other Melkite bishops, in January 1857 he introduced the Gregorian Calendar in place of the Julian Calendar to promote conformity with the uses of the Latin Rite as well as of the Maronites and of the Syriac Catholic Church; that act caused some discontent within the Melkite Church, and the opposition was led by the Archbishop of Beirut, Agapis Riyasi, the same who led the opposition against Maximos Mazloum some years before. Clement Bahouth, seen the discontent, resigned in August 1858, but the majority of the Melkite clergy and laity asked Rome to reject Clement's resignation, as it happened in September 1858. The 1859-1860 war between Maronites and Druzes, and the massacre of Christians in Damascus became more important issues than the calendar's one for most of the Melkites. A new player appeared: the Russian Orthodox Church, hoping to expand its influence in the Middle East, persuaded three of the bishops opponent to Clement Bahouth to formalize a schism, known as schism of the sarqiin, creating a new Church separated from both the Melkite Catholic Church and from the Antiochian Orthodox Church. This schism, notwithstanding the funds given by Russia to build churches, ended after a few years, and never numbered more than five thousand adherents. In 1864 Clement Bahouth asked Rome again to resign and to elect as successor Gregory Youssef, who was appointed bishop of Acre a few years before by Clement himself. This time Rome authorized the resignation, and a synod of bishops was summoned 24 September 1864. At the opening of synod Clement announced his resignation, and the synod in a few days elected Gregory II Youssef according to Clement's wishes. After this synod Clement Bahouth returned to live as a simple novice monk. In 1870 he participated silently at the First Vatican Council. He died on 13 June 1882 in the Holy Saviour monastery, where he was buried.

It opened in 1850 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway's branch line to Verney Junction which provided connections to Banbury, Bletchley and Oxford and closed in 1963.  History  From 1899 until 1963, Brackley was served by two railway stations on different lines. Brackley Central - opened by the Great Central Railway - was the second, the Buckinghamshire Railway having already connected the town to the railway in 1850. As the Great Central's station was constructed at the top of the hill upon which Brackley is situated and Buckinghamshire Railway's station at the foot of the hill, locals referred to them respectively as the Top Station and the Bottom Station.Kingscott, G., p. 62. The Buckinghamshire Railway's station was built at the southern end of the main high street and was constructed of a yellow-grey coloured stone.Simpson, B., p. 87. A single loop was enclosed between two-facing platforms, each of a height of 32 inches. A water tower for locomotives was positioned on the roof of a stone shelter situated on the up platform, slowly refilling from a nearby spring. The station's goods shed was built at a right angle to the line where a wagon turntable enabled vehicles to roll into the shed, aided by a slight gradient. A short spur on a severe gradient served the Hopkins and Norris brewery; horses drew the wagons up the gradient to allow them to be returned to the station yard by gravity. The spur (known locally as the \\"barrel line\\") fell into disuse in the early 1920s and the rails were lifted by 1935.Simpson, B., p. 88-89. The station's goods yard was not large, but was capable of accommodating the daily 3 to 12 wagons destined for the gasworks and the 4 to 5 wagons of malt and sugar for the brewery. A cattle dock could take four vans, and a 5-ton capacity crane was stationed in the yard.Simpson, B., p. 92-93. The arrival of the Great Central in Brackley saw a great deal of trade ebb away from the branch. The Great Central provided a faster and more direct route to London; its station enjoyed seven trains a day from Marylebone, including an express which took 84 minutes, compared with the line's infrequent sparse service to Euston via Bletchley.Davies, R. and Grant, M.D., p. 195. The branch line was used to transport bricks for the construction of the Great Central's station, and a new siding was installed near the line's ten mile post.Simpson, B., p. 89. On 13 May 1950 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth arrived at Brackley station en route to the first official British Grand Prix held at Silverstone. At the last minute it was discovered that the platform would be too low for the Royal Train's exit door and so an old wooden ammunition box had to be found and upended next to the door.

The arc first appears in Iron Man #149-#150. One of the most popular stories of the title character, it establishes Doctor Doom as a member of his rogues gallery, a villainous counterpart who mirrors the superhero with his wealth, power armor and engineering skill. Plot summary Tony Stark learns that an employee of his made illegal sales of technology to Doctor Doom. After immediately firing the employee, Stark cancels the sale and attempts to return the payment. Doom not only refuses the refund, but sends agents to seize the refused goods by force. Stark, as Iron Man, is unable to prevent the robbery and travels to Doom's country of Latveria to recover the goods personally. When Iron Man attacks Doctor Doom's castle, the two are flung back in time on Doom's Time Platform by his traitorous minion Hauptmann to the days of Camelot. Iron Man meets and joins the forces of King Arthur, while Doom joins with Morgan le Fay to enlist her in helping wrest his mother's soul from Hell. Le Fay agrees on the condition that Doom become the general of her army of undead warriors slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother King Arthur. Accompanying Arthur's knights against Doom's army Iron Man defeats Le Fay, causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swears vengeance on Iron Man for this, but the two agree to a temporary truce to use parts from both their armors to create a basic time machine to take them back to the present. Sequels The story arc proved quite popular and Marvel commissioned two sequels both written by Michelinie and Layton: *\\"Recurring Knightmare\\" (Iron Man #249-#250) - Iron Man and Doctor Doom are sent to the year A.D. 2089 complete with a future version of Camelot, where they must ally with a reborn Arthur- here only a young boy- and Merlin against Stark's descendant Andros Stark- now a mercenary using an old armour for his own gain- and Doom's own future self. Doom slays his double while Iron Man wields Excalibur against his descendant, but their memories of their time in the future - including Doom's discovery of Iron Man's true identity - are erased when they are sent back to their home time, the spell that brought them to the present preventing them from bringing anything from the future back with them. *Iron Man: Legacy of Doom - A four-issue miniseries where Iron Man and Doctor Doom battle, includes a trip to Mephisto's Hell dimension. In addition the story arc \\"Time Is on No One's Side\\" (Mighty Avengers #9-#10) features Iron Man and Doom, along with the Sentry, being sent back in time to the 1970s-era Marvel Universe and heavily references \\"Doomquest\\", such as the two men noting that they cannot duplicate their previous success at creating a time machine from their armours as they lack the components they used originally. What If? Vol. 1 #33 includes the story \\"What If Iron Man Was Trapped In The Time Of King Arthur?\\" In the alternate timeline, Doom does not seal the truce at the end of Doomquest with his word of honor. He betrays Iron Man, leaving Stark stranded with incomplete armor. \\"Sir Anthony of Iron\\" becomes a Knight of the Round Table. When Arthur is mortally wounded in battle, he names Tony as his heir. The empire he builds ushers in 1000 years of world peace, but Tony lives the rest of his life in the Middle Ages, totally separated from the world and time in which he belongs. Collected editions In 2008, \\"Doomquest\\" and the sequel \\"Recurring Knightmare\\" were collected as a Marvel Premiere hardcover edition entitled Iron Man: Doomquest ().

Landsat 7 image, 2000 The volcanoes of east-central Baja California are located on the Baja California Peninsula near the Gulf of California, in the state of Baja California Sur, in Mexico. Geography Sierra San Pedro M√°rtir Baja California is a peninsula in Mexico, bordering the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California. It is made up primarily of mountains, and some coastal plains. The mountain ranges in Baja California, connected to the Pacific Coast Ranges, extend from the north-eastern to the south-western part of the peninsula. Out of the 24 named ranges, the Sierra de Ju√°rez and the Sierra San Pedro M√°rtir, the highest range in Baja California, are the two most significant. The slopes of the ranges vary depending on location; the slopes on the western side are gentler than those on the east. Coastal plains are mostly found in the south- west regions on the peninsula. In the center of Baja California, volcanic activity is found mostly near the San Ignacio area. The landscape is a patchwork of lava flows and the hardened remains of pyroclastic flows ‚Äì hot clouds of volcanic ash, dust, and rock fragments that race down the slopes of a volcano like an avalanche. La Reforma Caldera La Reforma Caldera is a volcano on the east-central Baja California. It is about in diameter and tall. In the east-central Baja California there are several volcanoes and this one lies east of the Tres V√≠rgenes volcano and southeast of El Aguajito. La Reforma is a caldera volcano, formed when a large eruption left an empty magma chamber, which the upper volcano collapsed into. La Reforma's last major eruption occurred about 10,000 years ago. Its eruptions have consisted of ash and pumice falls, pumice flows, and pantellerite tuffs. The dark-colored rocks that make up the outer rim of La Reforma formed from very fluid lava. Tres V√≠rgenes The Tres V√≠rgenes, a line of three connected volcanoes, are west of La Reforma Caldera. They lie along the NE-SW eastern Gulf of California. The three are La V√≠rgen (The Virgin) in the southwest, El Azufre (Sulfur) in the center, and El Viejo (The Old One) in the northeast. El Viejo is the oldest and lowest peak, and La V√≠rgen is the youngest and tallest of the three. It has a history of pumice eruptions and explosive eruptions consisting of pyroclastic flows, dacitic and andesitic lava flows. The volcanoes get larger and younger from northeast to southwest. They consist of stratovolcanoes, lava domes, and pyroclastic cones. Dacitic lava domes and flows have occurred at El Viejo and El Azufre. Unlike other volcanoes in Baja California, the Tres V√≠rgenes are stratovolcanoes, consisting of alternate layers of ash and lava. The last time one of the volcanoes was active was in 1746, with a possible eruption in 1857. The evidence for the 1746 eruption came from a Spanish priest, who at the time was on a navigation in the Gulf of California. In his report, it was said that there was an ash plume from the effusive eruption, and while no tephra deposits have been discovered, there is evidence of andesitic lava flows that could have came from the 1746 eruption. As recently as 6,500 years ago, La V√≠rgen experienced a Plinian eruption ‚Äì a large and explosive event that creates a column of volcanic rock fragments and gas that reaches into the stratosphere. The eruption produced a column that reached at least 18 kilometers into the air and deposited ash and rock fragments over 500 square kilometers. In later stages of the eruption, pyroclastic flows (pinkish rocks) and lahars (mudflows, grayish rocks) from El Azufre Volcano paved the plain to the north all the way to the Gulf of California. El Aguajito Caldera El Aguajito Caldera, also known as Santa Ana Caldera, is located northeast of the Tres V√≠rgenes. The caldera's formation \\"is associated with the eruption of ignimbrites, K‚ÄìAr dated at Ma\\". The rim of the caldera is approximately wide and is not exposed to the surface. There is an active geothermal system with hot springs on the southern side of the caldera.

The reasons for abolition include removal of unelected houses, under-representation of ethnic/religious minorities, under-representation of women, cost-cutting in government expenditure, longer and unlimited terms in office (leading to accusations of monarchism), and to speed up the process of legislation due to upper house scrutiny. AustraliaQueensland= The Legislative Council of Queensland was the upper house of the Parliament of Queensland, and was entirely appointed by the Governor of Queensland. The appointed membership, along with the Council's opposition to many of the reform measures of the Ryan Labor Government which was elected in 1915, resulted in the government formulating a policy to abolish the Council, a proposal continually rejected by Council Members, and defeated in a 1917 referendum. After the Labor Government of Ted Theodore had Acting Governor William Lennon appoint 14 Labor Members to the Council, giving the Government a majority in the Upper House, the Legislative Council sat for the last time on 27 October 1921, the day after it voted itself out of existence. All other Australian states continue to have a bicameral system. CanadaProvincial-level= Some Canadian provinces once possessed upper houses, but abolished them to adopt unicameral systems. Newfoundland had a Legislative Council prior to joining Canada, as did Ontario when it was Upper Canada. Newfoundland has the power to re- establish its upper house, the Legislative Council, pursuant to Term 14 (2) of the Terms of Union.http://www.exec.gov.nl.ca/royalcomm/resources/nf_act.htm Manitoba had an upper chamber until it was abolished in 1876, New Brunswick's upper chamber was abolished in 1892, Prince Edward Island's upper chamber was abolished in 1893, Nova Scotia's upper chamber was abolished in 1928 and Qu√©bec's upper chamber was abolished in 1968.House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Second Edition, Audrey O‚ÄôBrien and Marc Bosc, 2009 Denmark The Landstinget was the upper house of the legislature of Denmark from 1849 until 1953. It was abolished in the 1953 referendum when the new constitution was approved. Estonia According to the 1938 Constitution, the Riigikogu had two chambers, which replaced the unicameral system. The lower chamber was called Riigivolikogu and the upper chamber was named Riigin√µukogu. Both chambers were disbanded in 1940, following the Soviet occupation, and riggedJustice in The Baltic at Time magazine on Monday, August 19, 1940 elections for only the lower chamber Riigivolikogu were held. According to the 1992 Constitution of Estonia, the parliament is once again unicameral.The legislative bodies of the Republic of Estonia IndiaState-level= The State Legislative Council or Vidhan Parishad is the upper house of the state legislature in India. The states of Assam, Bombay, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have abolished the Vidhan Parishad in their legislatures. The Vidhan Parishad of Andhra Pradesh was abolished in 1985 but revived again in 2007. Sweden The F√∂rsta kammaren was the upper house of the legislature of Sweden from 1866 to 1970 until an amendment was made to the 1809 Instrument of Government in the 1970 general election. New Zealand The (appointed) New Zealand Legislative Council was abolished in 1951. United StatesState-level= Nebraska is the only state in the United States to have a unicameral legislature, which it achieved when it abolished its lower house instead of the upper house in 1934.

Filmed in Lake Havasu City, Arizona and Bakersfield, California in the spirit of Brokeback Mountain, Arizona Sky follows the lives of two young men from rural America who fall in love as teenagers and find a way to rekindle that love later in life.This Week in Texas, By Duane Simolke (Sep 21, 2008), \\"Arizona Sky - Now available for pre- order\\", Accessed 12-25-2008 Plot Arizona Sky is a romantic story of two high school buddies who reconnect with desire in their hearts. As the film opens, the teenagers Kyle (Kyle Buckland) and Jake (Blaise Embry) are getting together for what appears to be a regular ritual of sleeping under the desert stars. The passions of first love are evident in these two young men. They eat some supper and then curl up on blankets for an evening of necking in the back of Kyle's truck. This happy interlude is at an end, as Jake is set to move with his dad to the big city. Fifteen years pass and the film picks up with an adult Jake (Eric Dean) now a successful film producer with a stressed and loveless life. After an anxiety attack, Jake's assistant Brian (Evan Cuthbert) urges him to take a break from all stresses for the first time in years, encouraging him that it's time to take a vacation and step back from his troubles. This is seconded by Jake's friend Steve (Brent King), who agrees to accompany Jake to his hometown in Arizona to help him find himself and unwind. Once more in Arizona, Jake finds Kyle's Aunt Elaine (Patricia Place) listed in the local phone book.

Born in Dabo, located in the Lorraine region of France,U.S. Passport Application #57182 - for Leon Dabo [father Ignace Dabo was born in Dabo, France] he was a successful ecclesiastic decorator. He worked mostly as a mural painter but also in stained glass and many of his creations have survived to this day. Much of his work from the mid 19th century was created in and around Saverne, France not far from Dabo, but the last thirteen years of his life and career Ignace worked in the Detroit, Michigan area of the United States. He is perhaps best known as the father of the tonalist painters Leon Dabo and Theodore Scott-Dabo. Life None of his personal records are known to exist, thus little of Ignace's early life or artistic training is more than conjecture. Yet there are a few clues. One obituary stated that he was a pupil of Paul Delaroche.Boston Evening Transcript (July 18, 1883) pg. 1 col. 4 His eldest son Leon, also an artist who wrote and lectured on art, stated in an article on religious art that in \\"Detroit there was a talented Frenchman, Ignace Schott, who was a pupil of Delacroix.\\"\\"The Roerich Exhibition\\", Little Flower Monastery Messenger (Jan 1932) vol. 4, no. 4, p. 111 Leon also mentioned in some correspondence that his father was a \\"fellow student of J. M. Whistler's at Gleyre's studio.\\" In a magazine article on stained glass, Leon wrote that Friederichs and Staffin of Detroit had a French designer in the 1870s (Leon's father) who had been trained by Champigneulle.\\"Stained Glass in the Church\\", Little Flower Monastery Messenger (Aug1931) vol. 3, no. 5, p.143 These few hints do fit the timeline of when Ignace would have been studying at the beginning his career. Much of Ignace's known works are ecclesiastic murals. One of Ignace's first teachers, Eug√®ne Delacroix worked for many years in Paris on a number of mural commissions beginning in 1833. Ignace would have been fifteen years old then, an appropriate time for an apprenticeship. Paul Delaroche taught painting in Paris until 1843, and the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre took over Delaroche's studio and opened it to students twice a week for instruction. It is known that by 1846 Ignace was in Saverne and worked fairly extensively in the area through to 1869, he executed several mural works for the religious community there. The General Inventory of Cultural Heritage for Alsace lists a number of signed works on the walls of Ste Leger Church in Reinhardsmunster, Ste Gallen Church in Siltzhiem, Ste Florent Church in Weislingen, as well as a convent and bishop's residence near Saverne. A professor in Saverne from 1849 to 1869, Ignace seems to have also been a professor of aesthetics in Nancy at some point during these two decades.\\"Signature on Glass: Discovering the Life and Art of Ignace Schott\\", Michigan History Magazine (Mar/Apr 1995) p. 50 In the late 1850s Ernest Delannoy and James McNeill Whistler traveled through Alsace-Lorraine, their friend of Dabo joined them on a few sketching excursions. It is possible that it was Ignace's workshop in Saverne where Whistler made some of the first etchings for The French Set. In the 1860s Charles-Fran√ßois Champigneulle worked in stained glass and had his workshop in Metz, just north of Nancy and west of Dabo and Saverne, Ignace was in the right time and place to assist with Champigneulle's work restoring church windows that had been damaged during the revolution. Ignace's relatives from Nancy, the writer, literary and art critic team of Edmond and Jules de Goncourt made their home in Paris, which naturally allowed Ignace access to such literary figures on the liberal Republican left as Victor Hugo and Jules Valles. Through his association with people like Hugo and Valles, then of course his connection to the politically liberal Gleyre, Ignace became very involved in the political arena. The university setting within which he had begun to work may have also stimulated his political activism. Ignace's son Leon would later write \\"my father founded with Jules Valles a republican newspaper secretly, and was in other ways obnoxious to the Emperor.\\" An obituary of Ignace in the Boston Evening Transcript, states that he was \\"made a life sentence by Louis Napoleon.\\" It is probably due to his association with people like Valles, whom the government of Napoleon III imprisoned twice for press violations by 1868, that he began to feel uneasy with continuing to live in the politically tense France. During the early 1860s Ignace had married a young woman, Madeleine Oberle. Their first child, Leon, was born in 1864, Theodore followed the next year and their first daughter, Leontine came in 1867, and by 1868 Madeleine was pregnant once again. Escaping the political unrest of the Franco-Prussian War, Ignace and his young family fled to America, arriving in New York City on January 5, 1870.S.S. Silesia Ship Manifest (January 5, 1870) p. 2 Trying to assimilate more easily the Schott family went first to French-speaking Canada, but by June 1870 they had settled in Detroit, Michigan with its large French community.1870 U.S. Census, Detroit Ward 3, Wayne County, Michigan; Roll M593_712; p103; images 206 & 207Sweeney, J. Gray (1987). Artists of Michigan From The Nineteenth Century. Muskegon Museum of Art. p. 155 Most often known as Ignatius Schott in America, he continued to work as an ecclesiastic decorative artist. Some of his work can still be seen at St. Anne's Church, Most Holy Trinity Church and St. Joseph's Church in Detroit, St. Alphonsus in Windsor, Ontario and St. Boniface of All Saints Parish in New Riegel, Ohio.\\"Signature on Glass: Discovering the Life and Art of Ignace Schott\\", Michigan History Magazine (Mar/Apr 1995) p. 48 Numerous mentions were made in the 1870s and early 1880s Michigan newspapers of the work being created by Mr. Schott. The murals at St. Mary of Good Counsel in Adrian, Michigan was one of Ignace's first commissions in America. Then there was the scene from Hamlet he painted in 1875 on a \\"ten by twenty-eight canvas framed in an ornate cornice over the proscenium arch\\" at Whitney's Opera House. He did two large canvases for the sanctuary at St. Vincent de Paul's church, one being a depiction of the Holy Family the other was the death of St. Joseph, both paintings were completed for the reopening of the church at the Easter celebration in 1880. Later that same year Schott executed work at Holy Cross Church in Marine City and he or his eldest son painted the Stations of the Cross for St. Stanislaus Kostka church in Bay City. Most if not all of these works have since been either removed or destroyed. Ignace was also employed for many years by the stained glass firm of Friederichs and Staffin, later known as the Detroit Stained Glass Works. There he created works like the imposing window The Trinity and The Redemption that is above the main altar of Most Holy Trinity Church. Ignace did non-ecclesiastic work as well and at least two of his paintings were in the private collection of Detroit architect Gordon W. Lloyd, the Alsatian Girl and Hebe, after Ary Scheffer. Early in 1876, Mr. Lloyd loaned the paintings to the Detroit Art Association for their first exhibition. In order to keep his identity somewhat hidden, Ignace would invariably alter the spelling of his name. Not only would he and his family use Ignace, but also Ignatius, Ignatz, Ignaz and even Enoch and Engus.Detroit City Directory (1870) p. 389 (1871) p. 384, (1872) p. 439Brooklyn City Directory (1891) p.1038 The family's surname has appeared as Schott, Schoote, Scott, de Dabo, D.

The eldest two of Ignace and Madeleine's eight children followed their father's profession and were artists of rare talent. Leon Dabo had a long and accomplished career both in America and Europe, yet the younger of the two, Theodore Scott-Dabo, though talented left almost no legacy. Ignace's sons received their initial artistic instruction from their father and both Leon and Theodore would also use a monogram to sign their work. On a Sunday early in March 1883, the Detroit Free Press listed on its front page an obituary column, \\"Died: SCHOTT ‚Äì March 3, 7p.m., Ignace Schott, artist, aged 64 years 7 months and 4 days.

It has been observed by a large range of instruments since its discovery, including WMAP, EGRET, GALEX, VSOP and Parkes, and has been regularly imaged by the Very Long Baseline Array since 1995. It has also been detected in gamma rays, and a gamma-ray flare has been detected from it. In 1963 Nikolai Kardashev proposed that the then- unidentified radio source could be evidence of a Type II or III extraterrestrial civilization on the Kardashev scale. Follow-up observations were announced in 1965 by Gennady Sholomitskii, who found that the object's radio emission was varying; a public announcement of these results on April 12, 1965, caused a worldwide sensation.\\"Is Man Not Alone in the Universe?

The line is owned by the Columbiana County Port Authority, leased to the Eastern States Railroad, which is owned by the line's primary shipper, and contracted out to the YSRR. Freight is interchanged with CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway at the Youngstown end. The trackage was originally owned by the Youngstown and Southern Railway , which operated from 1904 to 1993, including a period as an electric interurban passenger railway between 1907 and 1948, being the last such line in Ohio. It was later jointly owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. After a local company bought the line in November 1996 and illegally closed it and blocked repairs, the line was out of service for almost five years until the Central Columbiana and Pennsylvania Railway began operations in May 2001. Service under the YSRR name started in 2006, after the second of two less-than-two- year periods of operation by the Ohio Central Railroad System component Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad (the first was in 1995 and 1996). Line description The YSRR begins in southern Youngstown, where it interchanges with CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway adjacent to the Mahoning River. It heads northwest up the river bank and then curves southwest to climb a ravine to the highlands of Boardman Township. The original interurban line followed Front Street and South Avenue out of downtown and over the Mahoning River, then a private right-of-way between Wabash and Franklin Avenues, joining the present line just east of South Avenue.Railroad Switching District: Youngstown Ohio, January 25, 1934 Beyond Boardman, the line continues through the highlands, crossing the Norfolk Southern Railway's Fort Wayne Line at Columbiana. As it approaches Signal, where it turns east, and the Pittsburgh, Lisbon and Western Railroad once continued west, it drops into the valley of the Little Bull Creek, which empties into Bull Creek before it reaches Negley. From that community, the Smiths Ferry Branch formerly extended south alongside the North Fork and main course of Little Beaver Creek, reaching the Ohio River at Smiths Ferry. The main line continues east from Negley, up the North Fork Little Beaver Creek valley into Pennsylvania, where it ends at Darlington. It formerly continued a short distance farther to the Fort Wayne Line at New Galilee.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed December 2008 via ACME Mapper History The Youngstown and Southern Railway (Y&S;) and Youngstown and Salem Railroad were both incorporated in May 1903,Ohio Secretary of State, Annual Report for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1903, p. 811 and the former absorbed the latter in October of that year.New York Times, General Business Items, October 6, 1903, p. 12 It began operations in 1904 as a steam line between Youngstown and Columbiana, and electrified the line with overhead wires in 1907, also extending it to Leetonia on the Youngstown and Ohio River Railroad (Y&OR;) that year. In addition to carrying passengers as an interurban railway, the company handled freight, primarily coal from the electric Y&OR; and the steam Pittsburgh, Lisbon and Western Railroad (PL&W;). After the Y&S; entered receivership in 1915, a 1916 reorganization produced the Youngstown and Suburban Railway.George W. Hilton & John F. Due, The Electric Interurban Railways in America, Stanford University Press, 2000, , p. 270 In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Mahoning Valley industries and the Pittsburgh Coal Company attempted to build a new rail line between the Ohio River and Youngstown, claiming that the existing railroad connections (Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad) refused to build suitable river transfer facilities. The Interstate Commerce Commission denied the application in exchange for the construction of these facilities. Later the coal company built a private railroad from the river at Smiths Ferry, Pennsylvania to the PL&W; at Negley, Ohio, where it connected to Youngstown through control, by its Montour Railroad subsidiary, of the PL&W; (New Galilee, Pennsylvania to Lisbon, Ohio) and Y&S; (the latter acquired in 1928), and construction of a line between the PL&W; at Signal and the Y&S; at Columbiana. (The PL&W; from Signal west to Lisbon was subsequently abandoned.) Large amounts of coal were shipped along the river from the mines to Smiths Ferry, and then over the rail line to Youngstown steel mills.Harold H. McLean, Pittsburgh and Lake Erie R.R., Golden West Books, 1980, , pp. 92-94Pennsylvania Railroad Board of Directors, Inspection of Physical Property, November 1948, pp. 122-128 The Y&S; changed its name back to Youngstown and Southern Railway in 1944, and on January 1, 1945 it merged the PL&W; into itself. After World War II, the Consolidated Coal Company, successor to the Pittsburgh Coal Company, decided to sell its railroad properties to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The PRR agreed to purchase the Montour, and with it the Y&S;, jointly with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE;), a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad (NYC). The two companies gained control on December 31, 1946, and simultaneously conveyed the private railroad south of Negley to the Y&S.; Passenger service ended in 1948 on the Y&S;, the last of Ohio's interurbans, and the Columbiana-Leetonia segment was abandoned that year, its connection to the Y&OR; being long-gone. The eastern end of the old PL&W;, from Darlington to New Galilee, was also abandoned then.Interstate Commerce Commission, Finance Docket No. 16126, 1948 (abandonment of Darlington-New Galilee and Columbiana-Leetonia) By 1960 the Y&S; had completely dieselized. After the Penn Central Transportation Company (successor to the NYC and PRR) declared bankruptcy in 1970, the newly independent profitable P&LE; acquired full control of the Montour, and with it the Y&S.; The P&LE;'s finances declined with those of the steel industry in the 1980s, and CSX Transportation acquired its main lines in 1991 and 1992.Kalmbach Publishing, Fallen Flags: P-S, accessed December 2008 The newly created PL&W; Railroad began operating the Y&S; under lease on May 1, 1993, and transferred the lease to the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad (O&P;), a part of the Ohio Central Railroad System, on June 14, 1995.Edward A.

After shippers complained,STB Docket No. AB-556 (Sub-No. 2X), April 28, 2008 the federal Surface Transportation Board (STB) investigated, and the O&P; and RVI negotiated a new lease agreement in early December.

A second filing in April was approved after RVI agreed to operate the line. RVI did not allow the CCPA to repair the line or carry out any repairs itself, instead filing for abandonment in January 1999 and again in May. CCPA submitted an offer of financial assistance to buy the line in September, and asked the STB to establish its value. The STB penalized RVI for its \\"blatant disregard of its common carrier obligation to provide service\\", including several sales and agreements it had made and kept secret. Only 20 days after purchasing the line in 1996, RVI had sold the \\"debris\\" (rail, ties, and ballast) to a scrap dealer. Later, in October 1999, RVI transferred subsurface and air rights to an affiliate, Venture Properties of Boardman, Inc. A November 1999 contract with Boardman Township required RVI's successor to pay for grade separations, and that month RVI sold a portion of the right- of-way to the Boardman Township Park District. During its ownership of the line, RVI had also allowed it to be paved over at grade crossings and for access to a shopping center partly owned by its CEO. The STB voided RVI's transfers, contracts, and agreements, and ordered RVI to sell the entire railroad property and pay for the necessary repairs.Frank N.

For the company to pass this \\"Railroad Ventures test\\", and therefore not be covered, the following must all be true: #The primary business purpose of the company is not to profit from railroad activities. #The company does not operate its line or retain that capacity. #The operator of the line is or would be a covered employer. Since RVI's primary purpose was to profit from selling off the line, it failed the test.Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Railroad Ventures, Inc., Decision on Reconsideration, November 7, 2000 This was a departure from earlier decisions, which had cited a 1989 determination that the Board of Trustees of the Galveston Wharves was not a covered employer to declare any such non-operating company not covered.Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Railroad Ventures, Inc., 1998 The test has been applied to declare, for example, the Eastern States Railroad not covered (since it was created to preserve service rather than to profit)Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Eastern States Railroad, LLC, March 13, 2008 and Pennsylvania Lines, LLC covered (since it was wholly owned by Conrail, a for-profit carrier, and thus presumed to be for-profit).Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Pennsylvania Lines, LLC, March 28, 2001 References Category:Ohio railroads Category:Pennsylvania railroads Category:Railway companies established in 2006 ","title":"Youngstown and Southeastern Railroad"},{"id":"20833672","text":"Veenker Memorial Golf Course is a public golf course which is owned and operated by Iowa State University.

Background The objective of the operation was to clear and secure lines of communication in three provinces near Saigon and to secure the new Blackhorse Base Camp south of Xuan Loc. At first the operation was limited to clearing and securing Highway 1 from Xuan Loc to Bien Hoa and Route 2 to the base camp. As the operation continued, however, the 11th ACR extended its operations away from the roads and throughout the area. Regimental experience varied from roadrunner and convoy escort duties to cordon and search operations in which the squadrons sealed off an area and then worked, both mounted and dismounted, to drive out the Viet Cong (VC). It was during the operation that the 11th ACR fought its first major battle. Twice the VC tried to ambush and destroy resupply convoys escorted by units of the 1st Squadron, but in both attempts was defeated by the firepower and maneuverability of the cavalry. OperationBattle of Ap Hung Nghia= On 20 November, two battalions and headquarters of the VC 274th Regiment, the battle-hardened Dong Nai Regiment, moved into ambush positions along Highway 1, west of Xuan Loc. Midway between the provincial capitals of Bien Hoa and Xuan Loc, Highway 1 dropped sharply to a stream bed and then rose to a gently rolling plateau. A dirt road running north and south intersected Highway 1 at this point. Low hills rising only 10-20 meters above the road level began about 180 meters from the highway on both sides. On the north side of the highway, grass high enough to hide a standing man covered the ground. Rising like an island in the sea of grass was an expanse of jungle 1,000 meters square, beginning at the north-south dirt road and running parallel to Highway 1, 300 meters north of the edge of the highway. Along the south side of the highway a wall of jungle had grown up around the trees of an old rubber plantation stretching from the province boundary east for 1,000 meters and ending abruptly at a banana grove. The banana grove lined the south side of the highway for 300 meters before it gave way to an open area ending at the hamlet of Ap Hung Nghia (). Because the jungle and banana grove offered concealment for approach and withdrawal, the VC commander placed his main force of over a thousand men on the south side of the road, camouflaged and ready to fire automatic weapons and antitank rockets point-blank onto the highway. The ambush extended from just inside the west end of the jungle to the outskirts of Ap Hung Nghia, a distance of 1,500 meters. To handle any US troops who might dismount and take refuge on the north side of the road, the VC commander deployed infantrymen alone or in groups of two or three across the highway in the tall grass. In the classic manner of VC ambush forces, heavy weapons marked both ends of the killing zone. A 75-mm recoilless rifle, positioned less than from the road, marked the beginning of the killing zone, just inside the west end of the jungle close by the banana grove. A second 75mm recoilless rifle dominated the road in the eastern half of the killing zone from the forward slope of a slight hill just to the east of the banana grove. A 57-mm. recoilless rifle farther up the hill, three hundred meters to the east, and an 82mm mortar deep in the jungle were to provide supporting fire. Heavy machine guns hidden in huts scattered through the killing zone were to engage American helicopters and jets. Regimental headquarters operated on the crest of a hill 500 meters west of Ap Hung Nghia, overlooking the entire section of road in the killing zone. Once the ambush was executed the 274th Regiment was to withdraw to railroad tracks parallel to and a thousand meters south of the highway, then along a trail leading due south under a heavy canopy of jungle. Bunkers along the trail for a distance of 2 kilometres would provide cover against air attack, while bunkers at the beginning of the trail and a hundred meters south of the railroad tracks would provide defensive positions for a delaying force. By 06:00 on 21 November most of the convoy‚Äôs trucks waited at the starting point at Long Binh Post, for the movement of the 1st Squadron 11th ACR to their new home at Blackhorse Base Camp with departure scheduled for 07:00. However, as the departure was delayed the convoy grew as more vehicles joined it. At 08:40 the convoy escort commander 1st Lt. Neil Keltner, commanding the 1st Platoon, Troop C, 1st Squadron, gathered the vehicles for his escort, four ACAVs from his platoon and four from Troop C's 2nd Platoon and an ACAV from Troop A that had missed that troop's move the preceding day. Capt. Robert Smith, the Forward air controller (FAC) in a Cessna O-1 Bird Dog was circling above the convoy that now consisted of over eighty vehicles. For the march, Keltner placed his ACAVs in pairs: a pair at the head and rear of the column and at two points equidistant within the column. At 09:20 Lieutenant Keltner gave the signal to move out. As the convoy passed through the village of H·ªë Nai (now T√¢n H√≤a), a VC observation post flashed word to the 274th Regiment that the convoy was on the way. Haphazardly formed, lacking unit integrity, the convoy was by its very nature difficult to protect. Gaps within the column began to develop early as lightly laden vehicles pulled far ahead of heavily loaded trucks. Accordion-like, the line stretched. The convoy had been on the road less than 45 minutes when the 11th ACR‚Äôs tactical operational center, received an intelligence message indicating the presence of the headquarters of the VC 274th Regiment 15 kilometers west of Xuan Loc, along Highway 1 near Ap Hung Nghia. The S-2 intelligence officer radioed a warning of the VC location to the 1st Squadron's operations center at Long Binh. At the same time the assistant operations officer, ordered the 11th ACR light fire team (two armed UH-1 Huey helicopters) aloft to cover the convoy. Keltner's ACAV in the second group of escort vehicles was within 1000 meters of the ambush site when his radio crackled with a message from 1st Squadron headquarters warning of suspected VC activity. Keltner had received similar messages before and each time the VC had failed to show up. He immediately radioed the FAC to verify the location of the front of the column and the relation of the lead vehicles to the suspected VC position. Two FACs were by this time circling overhead as one had arrived to relieve the other. Both already were alert to the possible VC activity, having received a coded message 2 minutes before Keltner. The FACs reported that the head of the convoy, had just passed the suspected VC location. Keltner quickly radioed his ACAVs to warn them of the imminent danger. All but the lead ACAV, C22, answered. A few seconds later at 10:25 C22 reported receiving fire from small arms and automatic weapons and asked permission to return fire. Even as Keltner gave the permission, his own vehicle came alongside the edge of the banana grove that lay south of the highway, and Keltner informed squadron headquarters that the convoy was under fire. Reacting to earlier counterambush training, Keltner decided to run the column through the small arms fire. From the report of the lead ACAV he believed that the fire was only a harassing tactic, or at the most that it came from only a platoon or a company of VC. In any case, with 80 vehicles to protect and only 9 ACAV's to do the job, Keltner felt he had little choice. Still on the move, he ordered his own crew to spray the banana trees south of the road with fire. Just as his machine guns opened up, a mortar round burst close behind his ACAV and immediately in front of the next, A34, but did no damage. While all the ACAV's of the first two groups poured machine gun fire into both sides of the road, nearly half of the convoy, including Keltner's own vehicle, passed safely through and beyond the killing zone. But the full force of the VC ambush still had not been brought to bear. Even though Keltner had received the warning too late to stop the column short of the killing zone, he had been able to alert his escorts almost at the exact moment the VC moved to spring their ambush. The Dong Nai Regiment had been denied the benefit of total surprise. At Long Binh Lt. Col. Martin Howell, the squadron commander, heard Keltner report small arms fire. Like the lieutenant, he believed it to be harassing fire but nevertheless dispatched the remainder of Troop C to the scene. With Troop C moving out of the staging area and the light fire team helicopters, alerted earlier, rushing to the scene, help was on the way even before the battle reached a peak. Although most of the front half of the convoy had passed out of danger, 8 trucks had fallen behind because the first of the 8 was carrying a heavy load. As these last trucks and the section led by the next two ACAVs, C18 and C13, entered the killing zone, the ACAV fired first into the edge of the jungle and, as they kept moving, into the banana grove. The VC answered with small arms and automatic weapons from both sides of the road. To many of the men in the following trucks, this fusillade was the first warning of an ambush, for vehicle noises had drowned out the earlier exchange. The trucks not yet under fire began to slow down, their drivers displaying the uncertainty they felt about what lay ahead. Yet the convoy kept moving and the road ahead remained clear. The exchange of fire grew in volume as those trucks with \\"shotgun\\" riders began to engage the ambushers on the right (south) side of the road. Then a round from a recoilless rifle struck C18 on the edge of the loading ramp but failed to stop the ACAV. As the firefight continued at close range, the trucks forming the rear of the column, not yet in the killing zone, began to pull over to the side of the road. Those immediately behind C18 and C13, already under fire, stopped and the men aboard raced for cover in ditches on either side of the road. The only vehicles moving at that point were the last eight trucks from the first half of the column and ACAV's C13 and C18. Hardly had C18 escaped one round from a recoilless rifle when another burned a hole in its right side, starting a fire. This hit wounded the ACAV commander, but the crew continued to fire the .50-caliber machine gun and the M60 machine gunM60s into the VC position south of the road. Now another recoilless rifle round struck the heavily loaded lead truck whose slowness had opened a gap in the truck column. The gasoline tank exploded, instantly killing the two men in the cab. The truck lurched to the left into the ditch on the north side of the road, its trailer still on the pavement, partially blocking the highway. A column of thick black smoke shot into the morning sky. While the crew of C18 continued to fire, the wounded commander radioed his situation to Keltner. After passing the word on to squadron headquarters, Keltner turned around to enter the fight again, but before he could return C18 burst into flames. On order of the critically wounded sergeant, all the crew except the driver evacuated the vehicle, dragging the sergeant out of the commander's hatch and carrying him into the high grass on the north side of the highway. Only light fire had come from that direction, and it seemed the safest place to go. The driver of the burning C18 finally got it started again and headed down the road through a hail of small arms and antitank rocket fire, hoping to distract the VC's attention and allow the other crewmen to make good their escape. He succeeded, but was shot dead 400 meters down the road. Even as C18 fought, the troopers in C13, a few meters farther forward along the road, moved to counter small arms fire and grenades raining on the three remaining trucks to their front. Racing forward, the driver interposed his ACAV between the trucks and heavy fire coming from the banana grove on the right side of the road, but not before a recoilless rifle sent a second truck up in flames. As C13 came abreast of the burning truck, another round exploded against its right gun shield, destroying the M60 machine gun, killing the gunner, and wounding everybody but the driver. A recoilless rifle round struck the engine compartment and C13 began to burn. Although the driver himself was now wounded, he continued to move forward, deeper into the killing zone. Veering past the truck trailer that partially blocked the road, he went 1500 meters past the end of the ambush. Only then did the crew abandon the burning vehicle and moments later C13 exploded. Another round from a recoilless rifle hit one of the trucks that the trailer of the lead truck had blocked. Then came more fire, as the VC gunners methodically destroyed two more trucks. The US forces replied with fierce counterfire, as no ACAVs remained in the killing zone to provide fire support, they fully expected the VC to emerge from their ambush and overrun the ditch. But the VC were now under attack from the air. The column of smoke from the burning trucks was a beacon upon which air support was converging. A minute after the first truck was hit, the two FACs began firing white phosphorus marking rockets on the puffs of smoke from weapons firing in the banana grove and into the jungle opposite the burning trucks. Even as the first trucks were hit and the first rockets struck, the ambush was breaking up. When the two O-1s pulled out of their diving attacks, the only Huey gunship operational with the 1st Squadron that day moved in. From having monitored the 1st Platoon's radio frequency, it made two passes, firing machine guns and a total of eight rockets into the ambush positions. Close behind came the regimental light fire team, alerted only minutes before. Diverted from an administrative mission in mid-flight, the team commander, approached the scene from the south. The second helicopter had taken off from the Blackhorse helipad at the base camp and approached from the east. On the first pass the two Hueys loosed machine gun fire and six pairs of rockets at the VC. On the second pass the three Hueys poured continuous machine gun fire and nine pairs of rockets into the VC positions. On a third and then a fourth firing run they expended the remaining six pairs of rockets and continued to hit the VC with machine gun fire. While the fourth helicopter firing run was in progress, the regimental operations center radioed an order for the team to move north of the road to make way for a strike by Air Force jets. Only eight minutes into the ambush 3 F-100 Super Sabres now joined the fight. The air liaison officer at the Blackhorse operations center directed the aircraft to strike 50 meters inside the jungle, south of the highway. The jets dropped six high-drag 500-pound bombs at the western edge of the ambush. The FAC then marked for a Napalm run, and the jets dropped six tanks on more VC troops running south; they followed with a strafing run of 20mm cannon fire on VC fleeing along a trail in the jungle south of the road. As the air strike took place, Keltner was directing the commander of his lead ACAV to take that part of the convoy that had escaped the ambush on to the base camp. He himself turned his vehicle along with C10 back toward the burning trucks. Coming first upon C13, burning on the road, Keltner directed C10 to remain with the wounded crewmen who had taken cover in the high grass on the north side of the road until a helicopter could arrive, then C10 would rejoin Keltner. Alone, Keltner's ACAV pressed on at top speed toward the burning trucks, in the process radioing for a medical evacuation helicopter for the wounded. A helicopter from the Blackhorse base camp, already overhead and monitoring Keltner's frequency, responded immediately. As Keltner's ACAV sped along the highway, 10 VC suddenly darted across its path. Both the VC and the gunners in the ACAV opened fire. 5 of the VC fell; the others made it into the scrub jungle south of the road. Keltner's left machine gunner, hit in the head, died instantly. During this brief engagement a 57mm recoilless rifle fired five rounds at Keltner's vehicle. Despite the speed of C16, 35-45 mph, the last round hit its left side. Although the antitank round failed to stop the ACAV ACAV, Keltner and his right machine gunner were wounded by fragments and the intercom and radios were knocked out, leaving Keltner only a portable radio lashed to the outside of the commander's hatch. Intended for maintaining contact with the FAC, this radio provided the only remaining link between Keltner and his platoon. When he reached the abandoned and still-smoldering hulk of C18, Keltner could detect no sign of the crew. He stopped long enough to remove the vehicle's machine guns, then drove on until he reached the burning trucks. From the ditch along the south side of the road, the men from the trucks were still exchanging small arms fire with the VC. Five to six minutes had passed since C13 and C18 had been knocked out. Calling for a second medical helicopter for the wounded truck drivers, Keltner rode down the line of trucks to make certain he had missed no casualties. Finding none, he continued to the rear of the convoy, where he left his dead gunner and exchanged his ACAV for C23 which had an operable intercom and radios. Mounted in C23 and accompanied by C16, Keltner returned to the burning trucks, his gunners firing from the moving vehicle into the jungle. When the men from the trucks told him that most of the VC fire was now coming from the north, Keltner radioed for an air strike against the edge of the jungle lying north of the highway. This call coincided with the end of the strafing run by the F-100s, but in response to a request by the 1st Squadron operations center, initiated only minutes after the ambush was sprung, two F-5 Freedom Fighters had arrived over the ambush site. They swept in on the target, hitting the west edge of the patch of jungle with cluster bomb units. Observing the strike while cruising along the road with his machine gunners firing into the jungle on either side, Keltner called in an adjustment to Colonel Howell, who had arrived overhead in a Huey, and on the second pass the aircraft dropped napalm tanks closer to the south edge of the jungle. No further VC fire came from the north. After another quick but unsuccessful search for the crew of C18, Keltner returned again to the burning trucks even as the first of the relief forces began to arrive. When Colonel Howell had reacted to Keltner's first report of small arms fire by ordering Troop C to the scene, he had some qualms that he might be sending troops to deal with only a few snipers. But when Keltner's report of burning trucks came a few moments later, Howell ordered both Troop B and Company D (a tank company) to follow Troop C. As the squadron moved, Howell mounted his waiting helicopter. As soon as he gained altitude he could see the column of smoke from the trucks and the bombs of the air strike rising from the killing zone. Guiding on the smoke, the colonel was soon over the ambush site, talking to Keltner, adjusting the second air strike, and formulating his battle plan. Troop C would go south of the highway and then east along the railroad tracks, cutting off the most obvious route of retreat, while Troop B would swing north in an arc connecting each end of the ambush. The tanks of Company D would push along the highway to force the enemy into the encircling troops. As the relief force drew closer to the ambush, Howell and Keltner adjusted the second air strike to be brought against the VC positions. Minutes later, Troop B swung north through the strike zone, Troop C turned south, and Company D's tanks swept into the grass north of the highway. It was 11:00, only 35 minutes since the ambush had struck, and the squadron already had travelled over 20 kilometers. While the squadron maneuvered, Keltner searched again for C18's missing crew. This time he found the men in the grass north of the road protecting their critically wounded commander. Within a few minutes a helicopter had evacuated them. Twenty minutes after the relief force arrived, the southern pincer made contact with the enemy as they fired at what proved to be the rear guard of the 274th Regiment, fleeing south across the railroad tracks, killing 2 VC and capturing a Chinese-made 57-mm. recoilless rifle. For the rest of the day the tanks and ACA V's continued closing the circle around the ambush site. Cruising through the grass adjacent to the highway, Company D flushed out and killed, one at a time, 5 VC. Troop A, released from the base camp, joined the squadron and killed 1 VC, and Troop B captured another. By 16:00 it became clear that, even with the help of a South Vietnamese infantry battalion that made a cursory search of the area, the squadron had failed to trap the main VC force. Colonel Howell then directed the squadron to coil around the ambush site for the night. After encountering a few VC patrols that night, the squadron searched the battlefield the next day and for two days following. The men found bunkers along the escape route and a total of 30 VC dead. The convoy and its escort had lost 7 men killed and 8 wounded, 4 trucks and 2 ACAVs destroyed. =Battle of Su·ªëi C√°t= When intelligence reports indicated that there was a VC battalion in the vicinity of Su·ªëi C√°t (), 50 km of Saigon, the 1st Squadron conducted a limited zone reconnaissance but found no signs of the VC. Shortly thereafter, on 2 December 1966, Troop A was handling base camp security, Troop B was securing a rock quarry near Cia Ray, and the balance of the squadron was performing maintenance at Blackhorse Base Camp. Early that morning a resupply convoy from Troop B, consisting of 2 tanks, 3 ACAVs and 2 2 ¬Ω ton trucks, had travelled the 25km from the rock quarry to Blackhorse without incident. At 16:00 the convoy commander readied his convoy for the return trip to Cia Ray. The column had a tank in the lead, followed by 2ACAV's, 2 trucks, another ACAV, and, finally, the remaining tank. The convoy commander was in the lead tank, and after making sure that he had contact with the FAC in an armed helicopter overhead, moved his convoy out towards Su·ªëi C√°t. As the convoy passed through Su·ªëi C√°t, the men in the column noticed an absence of children and an unusual stillness. Sensing danger, the company commander was turning in the tank commander's hatch to observe closely both sides of the road when he accidentally tripped the turret control handle. The turret moved suddenly to the right, apparently scaring the VC into prematurely firing a command detonated mine approximately 10 meters in front of the tank. The commander immediately shouted an ambush warning over the troop frequency and led his convoy in a charge through what had become a hail of VC fire while he blasted both sides of the road. Even as the lead tank engaged, Troop B nearest the scene immediately headed toward the action. At squadron headquarters, Company D, a tank company, Troop C and the howitzer battery hastened towards the ambush. Troop A, on perimeter security at the base camp followed as soon as it was released. The gunship on station immediately began delivering fire and called for additional assistance, while the FAC radioed for air support. When the convoy reached the eastern edge of the ambush, one of the ACAV's, already hit 3 times, was struck again and caught fire. At this point Troop B arrived, moved into the ambush from the east, and immediately came under intense fire as the VC maneuvered toward the burning ACAV. Troop B fought its way through the ambush, alternately employing the herringbone formation and moving west, and encountering the VC in sizable groups. The squadron commander arrived over the scene by helicopter 10 minutes after the first fire. He immediately designated Highway 1 a fire coordination line, and directed tactical aircraft to strike to the east and south while artillery fired to the north and west. As Company D and Troop C reached Su·ªëi C√°t he ordered them to begin firing as they left the east side of the village. The artillery battery went into position in Su·ªëi C√°t. By this time Troop B had traversed the entire ambush area, turned around, and was making a second trip back towards the east. Company D and Troop C followed close behind, raking both sides of the road with fire as they moved. The tanks, fired 90mm Canister shot mowed down the charging VC and destroying a 57mm recoilless rifle. Midway through the ambush zone, Troop B halted in a herringbone formation while Company D and Troop C continued to the east toward the junction of Route 333 and Highway 1. Troop A, now to the west of the ambush entered the area, surprised a VC scavenging party, killing 15. The squadron commander halted Troop A to the west of Troop B. Company D was turned around at the eastern side of the ambush and positioned to the east of Troop B. Troop C was sent southwest on Route 1 to trap VC forces if they moved in that direction. As Troops A and B and Company D consolidated at the ambush site VC fire became intense around Troop B. The VC forces were soon caught in a crossfire when the cavalry units converged. As darkness approached the US troops prepared night defensive positions and artillery fire was shifted to the south to seal off VC escape routes. A search of the battlefield the next morning found over 100 VC dead, VC documents captured in May 1967 recorded the loss of 3 VC battalion commanders and 4 company commanders in the Suoi Cat action. Aftermath The success of the tactics for countering ambushes developed during Atlanta resulted in their adoption as standard procedure for the future. The tactics called for the ambushed element to employ all its firepower to protect the escorted vehicles and fight clear of the killing zone. Once clear the cavalry would regroup and return to the killing zone. All available reinforcements would be rushed to the scene as rapidly as possible to attack the flanks of the ambush. Artillery and tactical air would be used to the maximum extent.

It is bounded by barangay Tanguay and Tibig on the west, barangay Pusil and Paligawan on the east, barangay Malabanan on the north and barangay Maraouy on the south. History This barangay used to be known as Kay Magtago because at the time of the Spaniard invasions, many people made this place their hideout. In Filipino (Batangueno), kay means you and magtago means to hide. (Kay is an abbreviation of Ikaw Ay, Ikay, or \\"Kay\\") Folk etymology According to some old people living here, there was a house on this barangay long ago. Many people were cooking rice for their dinner. A Spaniard was spying on them. The Spaniard had no idea of where he was. Suddenly, an old woman said that bumubulak na ang kanin.

It contains six levels. Plot On the terrestrial planet Sephiroth, which is home to a variety of peaceful and prosperous advanced societies, an ancient evil has returned. A long time ago, a warmonger known only as Guardia was banished from the planet, but has finally returned with an entire space military. The Guardia Military soon invades Sephiroth and crushes its defenses with its long hardened space technology. Within time, a space fighter was developed to match the power of the Guardia Military. Based on Guardia's unknown desire for destruction and its own might, the ship was named the \\"XDR\\", or \\"X-Dazedly-Ray\\".  Gameplay  Players pilot the titular ship through six different checkpoint-heavy levels, blasting various ground and sky forces. Rather than having Bomb weapons, the ship is equipped to fire a variety of different shots and smaller bombs. Players can collect power ups such as different firing weapons, ground- force bombs, a shield and Options, all of which are upgradable to three levels. Players can also change the ship's speed through four variations. Many of the end-level bosses require timed shots in exact hit points, similar to Gradius. The XDR can use three different weapons from item pick-ups including its standard upgradable shot, missile pick-ups and Options. The ship can collect the Wide Beam/Vulcan shot, Laser and the Wave Shot. The missile pick- ups actually fire as ground force bombs that fire in four directions once fully upgraded. The ship's Options power up strangely in that the first selected Option encircles the ship, but the second and third power-ups cause the Option to follow the ship from behind rather than encircle it as well as multiply. The ship can also collect items such as a temporary shield and 1 Up icons.

It was derived from the Soyuz-U, and a member of the R-7 family of rockets. It featured increased performance compared with the baseline Soyuz-U, due to the use of syntin propellant, as opposed to RP-1 paraffin, used on the Soyuz-U. The increased payload of the Soyuz-U2 allowed heavier spacecraft to be launched, while lighter spacecraft could be placed in higher orbits, compared to those launched by Soyuz-U rockets. In 1996, it was announced that the Soyuz-U2 had been retired, as the performance advantage gained through the use of syntin did not justify the additional cost of its production. The final flight, Soyuz TM-22, occurred on 3 September 1995 from Gagarin's Start in Baikonur. The Soyuz-U2 was first used to launch four Zenit reconnaissance satellites, then it delivered crewed Soyuz spacecraft to space stations Salyut 7 and Mir: missions Soyuz T-12 to T-15 and Soyuz TM-1 to TM-22. It also supplied the stations with Progress cargo spacecraft: Progress 20 to Salyut 7, Progress 25 to 42 to Mir, followed by the new generation Progress M-1 to M-18 and finally M-23. Other missions included the Gamma telescope and three Orlets reconnaissance satellites. In total, Soyuz-U2 was launched 72 times and experienced no failures over its operational lifetime.

Buchanan, published in May 2008. Buchanan argues that both world wars were unnecessary and that the British Empire's decision to fight in them was disastrous for the world. One of Buchanan's express purposes is to undermine what he describes as a \\"Churchill cult\\" in America's √©lite and so he focuses particularly on how Winston Churchill helped Britain get into wars with Germany in 1914 and again in 1939.  Synopsis  Buchanan argues that it was a great mistake for Britain to fight Germany in both world wars, which he believes was a disaster for the whole world. = World War I = Buchanan accuses Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, of having a \\"lust for war\\" in 1914. Buchanan follows the conclusions of Kennan, an American realist diplomat, who wrote in his 1984 book The Fateful Alliance that the 1894 Franco-Russian Alliance was an act of \\"encirclement\\" of Germany and that German foreign policy after 1894 was defensive rather than aggressive. Buchanan describes Germany as a \\"satiated power\\" that sought only peace and prosperity but was threatened by a revanchist France obsessed with regaining Alsace-Lorraine. He calls Russia an \\"imperialist\\" power that was carrying out an aggressive policy in Eastern Europe against Germany. Buchanan argues that Britain had no quarrel with Germany before 1914, but the great rise of the Imperial German Navy, spearheaded by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, was a \\"threat to Britain\\" that forced the British to bring back to European waters the bulk of its Royal Navy and to make alliances with Russia and France. Buchanan asserts that a disastrous policy that \\"tied England to Europe\\" and created the conditions that led the British to involvement in the war. On the other hand, Buchanan asserts that the greatest responsibility for the breakdown in Anglo-German relations was the \\"Germanophobia\\" and zeal for the Entente Cordiale with France of the British Foreign Secretary, Edward Grey. In assessing responsibility for the course of events, Buchanan asserts that the British could have easily ended the Anglo-German naval arms race in 1912 by promising to remain neutral in a war between Germany and France. Buchanan calls \\"Prussian militarism\\" an anti-German myth invented by British statesmen and that the record of Germany supports his belief that it was the least militaristic of the European Powers. He writes that in the century between the Battle of Waterloo (1815) and World War I (1914), Britain had fought ten wars and Germany three. Buchanan points out that until 1914, German Kaiser Wilhelm II had not fought a war but Churchill had served in three wars: \\"Churchill had himself seen more war than almost any soldier in the German army.\\" Buchanan claims that Wilhelm was desperate to avoid a war in 1914 and accepts the German claim that it was the Russian mobilization of July 31 that forced war on Germany. Buchanan accuses Churchill and Grey of getting Britain to enter the war in 1914 by making promises that Britain would defend France without the knowledge of Cabinet or Parliament. Buchanan argues that the United States should never have fought in World War I, and that it was \\"deceived and dragged\\" into war in 1917: \\"Americans blamed the 'Merchants of Death' - the war profiteers - and the British propagandists\\" who created the myth of the Rape of Belgium. Buchanan calls the British \\"hunger blockade\\" of Germany in World War I \\"criminal\\" and accepts the argument of British economist John Maynard Keynes, who wrote in his 1919 The Economic Consequences of the Peace that the reparations that were imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles were \\"impossible\\" to pay. = World War II = Buchanan argues that World War II could have been avoided if the Treaty of Versailles had not been so harsh towards Germany. Buchanan views the treaty as unjust towards Germany and argues that German efforts to revise Versailles were both moral and just. Buchanan calls those historians who blame Germany for the two world wars \\"court historians\\" who he argues have created a myth of sole German guilt for the world wars. By contrast to his opposition to Versailles, Buchanan wrote that by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Germany had merely applied to that \\"prison house of nations,\\" Russia, the principle of self-determination, releasing from Russian rule Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caucasus (largely modern Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). Buchanan says that Hungary, which lost two thirds of its territory by the Treaty of Trianon, considered it a \\"national crucifixion\\" and was embittered towards the Allies by it. Buchanan thinks that Czechoslovakia should never have been created; it was \\"a living contradiction of the principle\\" of self-determination, with the Czechs ruling \\"Germans, Hungarians, Slovaks, Poles, and Ruthenians\\" in a \\"multi-ethnic, multilingual, multicultural, Catholic-Protestant conglomeration that had never before existed.\\" Buchanan accuses Czech leaders Edvard Bene≈° and Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk of deceiving the Allies, particularly US President Woodrow Wilson, on the ethnicity of the regions that became Czechoslovakia. \\"Asked why he had consigned three million Germans to Czech rule, Wilson blurted, 'Why, Masaryk never told me that!'\\". The alleged Wilson quote seems unlikely given the fact Wilson was well aware of demographic situation in the Bohemian crown lands in his 1889 book The State: Elements of Historical and Practical Politics. Furthermore Wilson only spoke with Masaryk on one occasion and wasn't interested in discussing Czechoslovak independence. As a result of their humiliation at Versailles, the Germans became more nationalistic and ultimately put their confidence in Adolf Hitler. Buchanan writes that there was a \\"Great Civil War of the West\\" in both world wars and in which Buchanan contends that Britain should have stayed neutral in rather than upholding an unfair Treaty of Versailles. Buchanan damns successive British and French leaders for not offering to revise Versailles in Germany's favor in the 1920s while the Weimar Republic was still in existence and stopped the rise of Hitler. Buchanan agrees with quotations of historians Richard Lamb and Alan Bullock that the attempt by German Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning to found an Austro-German customs union in March 1931 could have prevented Hitler from coming to power. Buchanan criticises the Allies for opposing it and quotes Bullock regarding their veto as not only helping \\"to precipitate the failure of the Austrian Kreditanstalt and the German financial crisis of the summer but forced the German Foreign Office to announce on September 3 that the project would be abandoned. The result was to inflict a sharp humiliation on the Bruning government and to inflame national resentment in Germany.\\" Buchanan argues that Britain, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia all indirectly assisted Hitler's rise to power in 1933. Weimar-era German leaders like Gustav Stresemann, Heinrich Br√ºning, and Friedrich Ebert were all responsible German statesmen, according to Buchanan, and were working to revise Versailles in a manner that would not threaten the peace of Europe, but they were undermined by the inability and unwillingness of Britain and France to co-operate. Buchanan follows the distinction made by German historian Andreas Hillgruber between a Weimar foreign policy to restore Germany to its pre-1918 position for some territorial expansionism in Eastern Europe and a Nazi foreign policy for which that was only the first step towards a larger programme of seeking Lebensraum by war and genocide in Eastern Europe. Since Buchanan argues that there was a moral equivalence between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, he maintains that Britain should have just allowed Germany and the Soviet Union to destroy each other and that Britain should have meanwhile awaited the course of events and rearmed fast enough to be able to fight if necessary. Buchanan argues that the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland in 1939 was impossible to fulfill but made the war inevitable. Buchanan calls Hitler's foreign policy programme more moderate than the war aims sought by German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg's Septemberprogramm in World War I. Buchanan contends that Hitler was interested in expanding into only Eastern Europe and did not seek territory in Western Europe and Africa. Moreover, Buchanan argues that once Hitler came to power in 1933, his foreign policy was not governed strictly by Nazi ideology but was modified ad hoc by pragmatism. Buchanan writes that Benito Mussolini was committed to the Stresa Front of 1935 and that it was an act of folly on the part of Britain to vote for League of Nations sanctions on Italy for invading Ethiopia, as that only drove Fascist Italy into an alliance with Nazi Germany. He writes that British opposition to the Second Italo-Ethiopian war was unnecessary, as the small territory Italy controlled were countered by the much larger British territories in Africa, meaning Italy could have never posed a threat to its colonies. Buchanan notes that France, under Pierre Laval, agreed to Italy's right to conquer Ethiopia as the price of maintaining the Stresa Front, but Britain had what Buchanan calls a \\"sanctimonious\\" attitude for sanctions in defense of what Churchill, quoted by Buchanan, described as \\"a wild land of tyranny, slavery, and tribal war.\\" Buchanan also quotes Churchill as arguing, \\"No one can keep up the pretence that Abyssinia is a fit, worthy, and equal member of the league of civilised nations.\\" In early 1936, when the crisis over Ethiopia had pushed Britain and Italy to the brink of war, there occurred the remilitarization of the Rhineland. Buchanan points out that Hitler regarded the Franco-Soviet Pact as an aggressive move directed at Germany and that it violated the Locarno Treaties, and he adds that Hitler had a strong case. Hitler utilized the claim of the violation of Locarno as a diplomatic weapon against which the French and the British had no answer. Buchanan argues that Hitler's public demands on Poland in 1938 and 1939, namely the return of the Free City of Danzig to the Reich, \\"extra-territorial\\" roads across the Polish Corridor, and Poland's adhesion to the Anti-Comintern Pact were a genuine attempt to build an anti- Soviet German-Polish alliance, especially since Buchanan argues that Germany and Poland shared a common enemy, the Soviet Union. Buchanan claims that Hitler wanted Poland as an ally against the Soviet Union, not an enemy. Citing March 1939 by the British historian Simon K. Newman and Andrew Roberts, in his \\"The Holy Fox: The Life of Lord Halifax\\", Buchanan argues that the British \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence in March 1939 was a deliberate ploy on the part of its Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax, to cause a war with Germany in 1939. Buchanan calls Chamberlain's \\"guarantee\\" of Poland \\"rash\\" and the \\"fatal blunder\\" that caused the end of the British Empire. Buchanan argues that Halifax and Neville Chamberlain had different motives for the guarantee. Without deciding between the various theories regarding Chamberlain's motivation, Buchanan recites several, including those of Liddell Hart, Newman, and Roberts. Buchanan agrees with British historian E. H. Carr, who said in April 1939 about the Polish \\"guarantee\\": \\"The use or threatened use of force to maintain the status quo may be morally more culpable than the use or threatened use of force to alter it.\\" Buchanan maintains that Hitler did not want a war with Britain and that Britain should not have declared war in 1939 on an Anglophile Hitler who wanted to ally the Reich with Britain against their common enemy the Soviet Union. Buchanan accepts the picture drawn by British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who, in his 1961 The Origins of the Second World War, considered Polish Foreign Minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck a frivolous and irresponsible man who was incapable of understanding the magnitude of the crisis that was facing his country in 1939. Buchanan argues that rather than offering a \\"guarantee\\" of Poland that Britain could not fulfill, Chamberlain should have accepted that it was impossible to save Eastern Europe from German aggression and instead set about re-arming Britain in order to be prepared for any future war with Germany, should it be necessary. Instead, Buchanan claims that the acceptance of Eastern Europe as Germany's sphere of influence as a quid pro quo for Germany staying out of Western Europe would have been better than World War II. Buchanan argues that it was a great blunder on the part of Chamberlain to declare war on Germany in 1939 and that it was an even greater blunder on the part of Churchill to refuse Hitler's peace offer of 1940, thus making World War II in Buchanan's opinion the \\"unnecessary war\\" of the title. The title of course was borrowed from Churchill, who stated in his memoirs, \\"One day President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once, 'The Unnecessary War.' There never was a war more easy to stop than that which has just wrecked what was left of the world from the previous struggle.\\" Buchanan writes, \\"For that war one man bears full moral responsibility: Hitler.... But this was not only Hitler's war. It was Chamberlain's war and Churchill's war....\\" In Buchanan's view, the \\"final offer\\" made by the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to the British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson on the night of August 30, 1939 was not a ploy, as many historians argued, but a genuine German offer to avoid the war. Likewise, Buchanan argues by citing F.H. Hinsley, John Lukacs, and Alan Clark that Hitler's peace offers to Britain in the summer of 1940 were real and so Churchill was wrong to refuse them. Buchanan calls the Morgenthau Plan of 1944 a genocidal plan for the destruction of Germany that was promoted by the vengeful Henry Morgenthau and his deputy, Soviet agent Harry Dexter White, a way of ensuring Soviet domination of Europe, with Churchill being amoral for accepting it. Buchanan even claims a moral equivalence between Churchill and Hitler. Buchanan suggests that there was no moral difference between Churchill's support for the compulsory sterilisation and segregation of the mentally-unfit before 1914 and the German Action T4 program. Likewise, Buchanan argues that the views that Churchill expressed about Judeo-Bolshevism in his 1920 article \\"Zionism and Bolshevism\\" seem not very different from Hitler's views about \\"Judeo- Bolshevism\\" in Mein Kampf. Buchanan attacks Churchill as the man who brought in the Ten Year Rule in 1919, which based British defence spending on the assumption that there would be no major war for the next ten years, and claims that made Churchill the man who disarmed Britain in the 1920s. Buchanan attacks Churchill as a inept military leader who caused successive military debacles such as the Siege of Antwerp, the Dardanelles campaign, the Norwegian Campaign, the Battle of Singapore, and the Dieppe Raid. Buchanan claims that Hitler's ambitions were confined only to Eastern Europe and cites such historians as Ian Kershaw, Andreas Hillgruber and Richard J. Evans that Hitler wanted an anti-Soviet alliance with Britain. Buchanan maintains that British leaders of the 1930s were again influenced by Germanophobia, which led them to suspect that Germany was out to conquer the world. Citing John Lukacs, Buchanan maintains that Operation Barbarossa was not part of any long-range master plan on the part of Hitler, but it was instead an attempt by Hitler to force Britain to make peace by eliminating Britain's last hope of victory by bringing the Soviet Union into the war on the Allied side. Buchanan argues that the Holocaust would not have developed the scale that it did without Hitler's invasion of Poland and then the Soviet Union, as he would not otherwise have been in control of most European Jews. Buchanan argues that if Churchill had accepted Hitler's peace offer of 1940, the severity of the Holocaust would have been greatly reduced. With respect to the debate about German foreign policy, Buchanan refutes historians, such as Gerhard Weinberg, who argue that Germany wanted to conquer the entire world, and he instead contends that Nazi Germany was never a danger to the United States and that it was not a danger to Britain after the Battle of Britain. Buchanan points out that the \\"master plan to conquer South and Central America\\" that Franklin Roosevelt publicly endorsed was actually produced by British intelligence and that German sources reveal no evidence for its veracity. Buchanan calls the British \\"area bombing\\" of German cities in World War II a policy of \\"barbarism\\" and quotes Churchill stating that its purpose was \\"simply for the sake of terror.\\" In particular, Buchanan argues that the bombing of Dresden in 1945 was barbaric and that Churchill personally ordered it by quoting Churchill himself and Air Marshall Arthur Harris as evidence. Buchanan believes that Churchill was largely responsible for \\"Western man's reversion to barbarism\\" in World War II and notes that generals like Curtis LeMay, when they bombed Japan, had followed the example set by British Air Marshal Harris in using \\"terror bombing\\" as a method of war against Germany.; Buchanan quotes LeMay himself \\"We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo that night of March 9‚Äì10 than went up in the vapour of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.\\" Buchanan concludes, \\"We and the British fought for moral ends. We did not always use moral means by any Christian definition.\\" Endorsing the concept of Western betrayal, Buchanan accuses Churchill and Roosevelt of turning over Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union at the Tehran Conference and the Yalta Conference. Citing the Cuban-American lawyer Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, Buchanan calls the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe, in which 2 million died, a crime against humanity \\"of historic dimensions\\" and contrasts the British prosecution of German leaders at the Nuremberg Trials for crimes against humanity while Churchill and other British leaders were approving the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe. Buchanan also writes that the United States should have stayed out of the events of World War II. However, because the United States insisted for the United Kingdom to sever the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1921, Japan ultimately aligned itself with the Axis and later attacked Pearl Harbor. Buchanan blames Churchill for insisting to the British Cabinet in 1921 to give in to pressure to end its alliance with Japan. Buchanan concludes that if World War II had not taken place, the British Empire would have continued through the 20th century. Buchanan favorably cites the 1993 assessment of Alan Clark that World War II \\"went on far too long, and when Britain emerged the country was bust. Nothing remained of assets overseas. Without immense and punitive borrowings from the US we would have starved. The old social order had gone forever. The empire was terminally damaged. The Commonwealth countries had seen their trust betrayed and their soldiers wasted.\\" Likewise, Buchanan blames British statesmen for bringing Britain into the war against Germany, which caused the economic ruin of Britain but also brought Communists to power in Eastern Europe and China in 1949, all of which would have been avoided if Britain had not \\"guaranteed\\" Poland in 1939. Buchanan claims that for the most part, American leaders in the Cold War followed the wise advice of Kennan, who understood that a strong Germany was needed as an American ally to keep the Soviet Union out of Central Europe. The United States did not rush into unnecessary wars with the Soviet Union but instead waited patiently for the Soviet Union to fall apart. Buchanan ends his book with an attack on George W. Bush and argues that just as Churchill led the British Empire to ruin by causing unnecessary wars with Germany twice, Bush led the United States to ruin by following Churchill's example in involving the United States in an unnecessary war in Iraq, and he passed out guarantees to scores of nations in which the United States has no vital interests, which placed his country in a position with insufficient resources to fulfil its promises. Buchanan expresses the view that just as Chamberlain's \\"guarantee\\" of Poland in March 1939 caused an \\"unnecessary war\\" with Germany in September, the current guarantees of Eastern European nations by the United States are equally unwise and require a declaration of war with Russia if a hostile regime ascended to power in the latter country and attacked Eastern Europe. However, the United States has no vital interests in Eastern Europe. Finally, Buchanan highlights the symbolism of Bush placing a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office as evidence that Bush's neoconservative foreign policy was influenced and inspired by Churchill.  Reviews  The book was 16th on its first week on The New York Times bestseller list.. MSNBC notes that Buchanan joins historians who are more critical of British involvement in World War II. The book has received mostly negative reviews. Canadian journalist Eric Margolis in the Toronto Sun endorsed Buchanan's study as a \\"powerful new book.\\" Margolis wrote that neither Britain nor the United States should have fought in World War II and that it was simply wrong and stupid that millions of people died to stop the 90% German Free City of Danzig from rejoining Germany. Margolis accepts Buchanan's conclusion that the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland in March 1939 was the greatest geopolitical blunder of the 20th century. Margolis wrote: Jonathan S. Tobin in The Jerusalem Post gave Buchanan's book a negative review and suggested the author is anti-Semitic and representative of a \\"malevolent\\" form of appeasement. American writer Adam Kirsch, in The New York Sun, attacked Buchanan for using no primary sources, and for saying there was a conspiracy by historians to hide the truth about the two world wars. Kirsch acidly remarked if that was the case, Buchanan did not need only secondary sources to support his arguments. Kirsch accused Buchanan of hypocrisy for denouncing Churchill as a racist who was opposed to non-white immigration to Britain but demanding the same in the United States. Kirsch wrote that Buchanan's apocalyptic language about the West in decline owed more to Oswald Spengler than to American conservatives. Kirsch argued that Buchanan's heavy reliance on Correlli Barnett's 1972 book The Collapse of British Power as a source reflects the fact that both Buchanan and Barnett are two embittered conservatives unhappy with the way history worked out and they prefer to talk about how much nicer history would have been if Britain had not fought in the two world wars or the United States and Britain in Iraq. American classicist Victor Davis Hanson criticized Buchanan for what he sees as a pro-German bias and instead contends that the Treaty of Versailles was too lenient rather than too harsh towards Germany. In his blog, Hanson called Buchanan a \\"pseudo-historian\\". In another entry on his blog to respond to criticism from Buchanan's admirers, Hanson stated that he loathed communism but argued that Churchill and Roosevelt had no choice but to ally themselves with the Soviet Union. In a hostile review, the American journalist David Bahnsen called Buchanan's book an \\"anti-semitic piece of garbage\\" and accused Buchanan of being unique in that he posited the Holocaust as an understandable, if excessive, response to the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland in 1939. British journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft, in a review in The New York Review of Books, complained that Buchanan had grossly exaggerated the harshness of the Treaty of Versailles by noting that most historians think that Germany started World War I and that Buchanan's criticism of the British \\"area bombing\\" of cities in the war pays no attention to how limited Britain's options seemed to Churchill in 1940.. Wheatcroft wrote that Buchanan cited right-wing British historians like Clark, Cowling, and John Charmley when they stated that Britain should never have fought Germany or at least should have made peace in 1940, but he ignored the wider point that Clark, Cowling and Charmley were making: they viewed the United States rather than Germany as the British Empire's main rival. Hungarian-American historian John Lukacs, in a review in The American Conservative, compared Buchanan to David Irving and argued that the only difference between the two was that Irving uses lies to support his arguments while Buchanan uses half-truths. Lukacs commented that Buchanan cites the left-wing British historian A. J. P. Taylor only when it suits him; when Taylor's conclusions are at variance with Buchanan's views, Buchanan does not cite him. Lukacs objected to Buchanan's argument that Britain should have stood aside and allowed Germany to conquer Eastern Europe as Buchanan ignores just how barbaric and cruel Nazi rule was in Eastern Europe in World War II. Finally, Lukacs claimed that Buchanan has often been accused of Anglophobia. Lukacs felt that Buchanan's lament for the British Empire was a case of crocodile tears. Lukacs concluded that Buchanan's book was not a work of history but was a thinly-veiled admonitory allegory for the modern United States with Britain standing in for the United States and Germany, Japan, and Italy standing in at various points for modern Islam, China, and Russia. Conservative American journalist Christopher Jones attacked Buchanan in a review for saying that Hitler's aims in 1939 were limited to allowing Danzig to rejoin Germany when Hitler wanted to destroy Poland. Likewise, Jones criticized Buchanan for writing that the Czech people were better off as part of the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, ruled over by Reinhard Heydrich, than as part of independent and democratic Czechoslovakia. Buchanan claims that Hitler did not want a world war over Danzig and uses the lack of readiness of the Kriegsmarine for a war with Britain in 1939 as proof of that. Jones notes the German navy was in the middle of a major expansion, codenamed Plan Z, intended to prepare it to take on the British navy by the mid-1940s. British journalist Christopher Hitchens, in a review in Newsweek, claimed that ignorance by Buchanan on the aggression of Imperial Germany and notes that Wilhelm openly encouraged Muslims to wage jihad against the Western colonial powers during World War I, conducting the Herero and Namaqua Genocide in German South-West Africa, and supported the Young Turks government while it committed the Armenian Genocide. Hitchens argued that Imperial Germany was dominated by a \\"militaristic ruling caste\\" of officers and Junkers who recklessly sought conflict at every chance, and that it was simply nonsense for Buchanan to write of Germany being \\"encircled\\" by enemies on all sides before World War I. Scholarship Buchanan cites many historians including George F. Kennan, Andreas Hillgruber, Simon K. Newman, Niall Ferguson, Charles Tansill, Paul W. Schroeder, Alan Clark, Michael St√ºrmer, Norman Davies, John Lukacs, Frederick P. Veagle, Correlli Barnett, John Charmley, William Henry Chamberlin, David P. Calleo, Maurice Cowling, A. J. P.

The McDonaghs decided to adapt it into a partial talkie and shot some additional scenes in Melbourne in 1930 using an improvised sound-on-disc system. These scenes included a fancy dress party sequence and a romantic scene where Paula sings a song to Lee.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p152 The musician's union temporarily prevented its members from recording music for the film. The McDonaghs responded by hiring non-union labour. Release In May 1930 the film was entered in the first Commonwealth Film competition but failed to win a prize. It did not perform well at the box office due in part to the poor quality of its sound recording. The critic from the Sydney Morning Herald was not enthusiastic about the movie's quality: > The Misses McDonagh's latest film... is not as interesting as their last > production, The Far Paradise. For one thing, they have slavishly copied > American models. Instead of striving to give their work originality, the > Americanisms, \\"big boy\\", \\"dame\\", and '\\"gangster\\", creep into the captions. > For The Cheaters is, through the greater part of its length, a silent > film... the use of captions seem strained and artificial...

The highway's southern terminus was at State Route 290 south of Hemlock Grove. The highway progressed northward along Hemlock Grove Road, passing through Hemlock Grove and into Greentown, where it terminated at an intersection with State Route 507. The highway was assigned in 1930 and decommissioned in the 1946 removal of state highways.  Route description  : Note: This route description is written as the highway that currently runs along this alignment. State Route 790 began at an intersection with State Route 290 about south of Hemlock Grove. (The current southern terminus is now State Route 447.) The highway currently progresses to the northeast, intersecting with the dead-end Log Cabin Road, and Liberty Lane, another dead- end road. After Liberty Lane, the former alignment of State Route 790 heads through a line of trees that parallel the highway. There is a short clearing, but this reverses itself before the intersection with Roemerville Road. At Turkey Run Road, there are some more houses, as the highway enters the southern limits of Hemlock Grove. In Hemlock Grove, the old alignment intersected with Valleyview Road, a short loop road in the community. There is some development surrounding the tree line, with minor highways intersecting. At Running Bear Lane, the road leaves Hemlock Grove and into Greentown, which is populated by trees. The highway crosses a creek that flows into Lake Wallenpaupack, intersecting with a similarly named highway just after. The northern terminus is with Brink Hill Road before the alignment of former State Route 790 at State Route 507 (Lake Wallenpaupack Road) in Greentown.  History  Along with some of the routes in Pennsylvania, State Route 790 was not assigned in the mass numbering of highways in 1928. State Route 790 was assigned along Hemlock Grove Road in 1930, running from State Route 290 to State Route 507. The highway remained intact for over a decade, as the Pennsylvania Department of Highways decommissioned State Route 790 in 1946. That year, the department had decommissioned a number of state routes around the commonwealth. The highway was turned over to local control, and the State Route 790 designation was removed. In 1964, eighteen years after State Route 790 was decommissioned, the southern terminus, State Route 290 was replaced by State Route 447.

Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan are two giant pandas that were sent by mainland China to Taiwan in 2008 as part of an exchange program. The exchange idea was first proposed in 2005, but the previous administration in Taiwan had refused to accept the pandas. After elections that resulted in a change of presidents in 2008, Taipei accepted the pandas, and they arrived in Taiwan on December 23, 2008. The two names were selected by a vote in the PRC and their combination, Tuan Yuan, means \\"reunion\\" in Chinese. The pandas are being housed at Taipei Zoo and have been exhibited to the public since the 2009 Chinese New Year.  Birth  Tuan Tuan, male, was born to Hua Mei on September 1, 2004 and was assigned as no. 19 in the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan. Yuan Yuan, female, was born on August 31, 2004 and was assigned as no. 16 in the Wolong National Nature Reserve. Their names, \\"Tuan Tuan\\" and \\"Yuan Yuan\\", were chosen in an unofficial public poll in mainland China the results of which were revealed live on national television during the 2006 CCTV New Year's Gala. Approximately 130 million mainland Chinese viewers cast their votes. Together, the names produce the Chinese phrase tuan yuan (), meaning \\"reunion\\".  Proposal and political resistance  The exchange of the pandas was first proposed during the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, when politicians from the then-Opposition Pan-Blue coalition, which is comparatively pro- unification in stance, visited mainland China. Chen Yunlin, then the head of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, announced on May 3, 2005, that Beijing would present two giant pandas to Taipei as part of an exchange program. The two pandas to be sent to Taiwan were chosen after 218 days of observation and discussion by experts from both mainland China and Taiwan, and were officially announced on January 6, 2006. The Chinese Wildlife Protection Society then began seeking nominations for the names to be given to the pair of pandas. These were announced on the eve of Chinese New Year, 2006 on the CCTV New Year's Gala live on national television. An opinion survey in Taiwan conducted by United Daily News in response to the exchange proposal found 50% of respondents in favour of accepting the pandas, and 34% opposed. However, the exchange proposal soon met political resistance in Taiwan. On March 31, 2006, the Agricultural Committee of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan decided not to issue permits for the importation, ostensibly on the grounds that the zoos in Taiwan applying for the importation did not meet facility and resource requirements for the proper care and rearing of the pandas, and that importation would not be in the best interest of protecting pandas. However, commentators generally observed that political considerations underlay the technical decision, with the independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian being opposed to what he saw as a propaganda move by Beijing. In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou, of the Kuomintang, was elected President, and over the next few months has forged stronger economic and political relations with mainland China under his presidency, and was willing to accept them. The offering of pandas a gift from mainland China is often known as \\"panda diplomacy\\", and Taipei Zoo expects to draw around 30,000 visitors a day as a result of their arrival. The move was criticized by supporters of Taiwan's independence and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who said that \\"Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan means a union, which perfectly matches Beijing's goal of bringing Taiwan into its fold.\\" Although Taiwan is not a CITES signatory and is therefore not obligated to report to the CITES Secretariat, the Secretariat of CITES said in response to the transfer that it viewed the transfer as an intrastate matter, and thus would be governed by whatever procedures and documentary requirements that are agreed upon by the Beijing and Taipei authorities. Both sides adopted procedures similar to standard CITES procedures for international transfers. On the import-export permits, the origin was listed as the Wolong Nature Reserve Management Office, while the destination was listed as the Taipei City Zoo.  Arrival in Taiwan and reaction  Tuan Tuan at Taipei Zoo Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan arrived in Taiwan aboard an EVA Air flight on December 23, 2008, and were transported to Taipei Zoo. The arrival of the pandas was met with intense public attention, described by the press as \\"Pandamania\\", with the pandas becoming instant celebrities. A variety of merchandise has already appeared, with even buses redecorated in panda-themed livery. At the same time, there has also been political controversy. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) continues to see the pandas as a propaganda move by Beijing. They have appealed to their supporters not to visit the pandas.  Offspring  Yuan Yuan gave birth to a cub on July 6, 2013 at the Taipei Zoo. The female cub was nicknamed Yuan Zai (also pronounced in Taiwanese Hokkien as Inn-a). Yuan Zai has several meanings: rice ball, and also '(Yuan)Yuan's child'. On October 26, at the zoo's 99th anniversary ceremony, the baby panda was officially named Yuan Zai after a naming activity that saw 60% of the votes go to the cub's nickname. She was also presented an honorary citizen's card on that day. As Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan were sent to Taiwan in exchange for two Formosan sika deer and two Taiwan serows, the cub does not need to be returned. On June 28, 2020 a second cub was born at the Taipei zoo. This cub was named Yuan Bao.

Etymology Piccata is an Italian word spelled sometimes as picatta or pichotta. The word \\"piccato\\", to which it may be related, may be a translation of the French piqu√©, past participle of piquer (\\"to prick, lard\\"), though it doesn't seem to fit the culinary use of the Italian term which means \\"to be pounded flat\\". When used in reference to a way of preparing food, particularly meat or fish, it means \\"sliced, saut√©ed, and served in a sauce containing lemon, butter and spices\\". Traditionally, the Italians use veal (veal piccata); however, the best known dish of this sort in the US uses chicken (chicken piccata). The recipe has a meatless adaptation using seitan (seitan piccata). Piccata is also prepared using veal (piccata di vitello al limone) or frittura piccata, particularly in the Milanese region swordfish (pesce spada con capperi e limone). Preparation A chicken breast is butterflied or sliced along its width. It is flattened to an even thickness with a tenderizer between two pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap. It is seasoned and dredged in flour before being browned in butter or olive oil. The sauce is made using the pan drippings. Lemon juice and white wine or chicken stock are added and reduced. Shallots or garlic can be added with capers, chopped parsley and slices of lemon. After reduction, butter is stirred in to finish the sauce. In the United States, it is usually served with a vegetable or a starch, such as pasta, polenta, or rice. In Italy, veal piccata is a secondo and would be served after the pasta (or other starch) course.

Pelham is also known for his appearances on the independent circuit in the Northeastern United States (with promotions such as Chaotic Wrestling and New England Championship Wrestling) as Max Bauer. Professional wrestling careerChaotic Wrestling (2005‚Äì2012)= Bauer first began competing in Chaotic Wrestling (CW) in 2005, and was part of the villainous faction Intellectual Properties with Arch Kincaid and Thomas Penmanship. On December 9, 2005, Bauer won the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship with Kincaid as part of Intellectual Properties, when they defeated Bryan Logan and Matt Logan. They held the title until April 21, 2006, when they dropped it to The Logan Brothers. On June 30, however, Kincaid and Bauer won back the CW Tag Team Championship from The Logan Brothers, but lost it to Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze on October 20. On December 1, 2006, however, Penmanship turned on the group, and was replaced by Alex Arion. In 2007, Bauer joined the Big Business faction with Arion and Brian Milones, and were managed by Cherry Payne. On March 30 Bauer and Arion won the CW Tag Team Championship by defeating Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze, but then lost it to Blade and Mikaze on May 18. On October 19, Bauer and Arion defeated Bryan Logan and Brian Fury. At the end of 2007 and start of 2008, Big Business were involved in a rivalry with Brian Fury, with all members taking him on in both singles and tag team matches. Bauer later broke away from Big Business, and began competing in singles matches, before forming a short-lived tag team with Chase Del Monte. On December 5, Bauer competed in a six-way number one contender's match, but it was won by \\"Big\\" Rick Fuller. In 2009, Bauer formed a tag team with Tommaso Ciampa. =New England Championship Wrestling (2006‚Äì2010)= Bauer made his New England Championship Wrestling (NECW) debut on June 10, 2006, defeating Nat Turner. In only his second NECW appearance on July 15, Bauer unsuccessfully challenged Frankie Arion for the NECW Television Championship. After a short hiatus from NECW, Bauer returned on October 28 at Monster's Brawl, as part of the DNA faction, alongside TJ Richter and Scott Reed, when DNA defeated Riot, Billy King and Mike Lynch. At the following show, Double Impact, Bauer and Reed, accompanied by Richter, defeated 2D Edge (Jose Perez and Pat Masters). On February 24, 2007, Bauer lost to Alex Arion, provoking a scripted rivalry between DNA and Alex Arion. At March Badness on March 24, Alex Arion defeated Bauer and Reed in a handicap match. At NECW Global Impact, after Alex Arion defeated \\"Sensational\\" Scott Reed on June 30, Bauer and TJ Richter attempted to attack Arion after the match but was stopped by NECW officials who threatened them with suspension. Arion then confronted Reed, Bauer and Richter, and challenged Richter to a singles match to allow his brother Frankie Arion, who had been forced to leave the promotion 10 months earlier, to return to NECW. Richter declined, and instead proposed a gauntlet match in which he would have to defeat all three men or retire from wrestling, to which Arion agreed. On July 20, Arion won the gauntlet match, after defeating Reed first, then Bauer via disqualification, and finally Richter to officially reinstate his brother. At NECW's Birthday Bash 7: Caged Fury on August 18, Bauer and Richter lost to The Arion Brothers. On October 27, Bauer lost a match to the NECW Television Champion Brandon Locke by disqualification after Richter, who had been banned from ringside interfered. Afterwards, Bauer attacked Richter to disband DNA. At The Toxic Waltz on December 28, Bauer won The Toxic Waltz tournament, by defeating Richter in the final, to earn a title match for the NECW Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship at Genesis. Bauer in 2008 At Snowbrawl on January 28, Bauer and his team of Brian Fury, Alex Arion, and Bobby Fish defeated Rick Fuller, D.C. Dillinger, Eddie Edwards and Antonio Thomas in a tag team elimination match. At Genesis on February 27, Bauer had the title match that he earned by winning The Toxic Waltz tournament, but lost to the reigning champion Rick Fuller by disqualification. In a rematch at March Badness, Fuller defeated Bauer to retain. On April 26, at Spring Breakdown the NECW Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship was vacated due to a controversial ending of the match at March Badness. As a result, a triple threat match, involving Bauer, Rick Fuller and Antonio Thomas, was set up as the main event, and Bauer won to become the undisputed champion. Numerous successful title defenses followed for Bauer, including a triple threat match at Birthday Bash 8: Larger Than Life when he defeated \\"Big\\" Rick Fuller and D.C. Dillinger. At the 2008 Toxic Waltz Tournament, Bauer competed under a mask as the \\"Masked Enforcer\\", and won the tournament by defeating Alex Arion. Bauer was not cleared to compete in the tournament, so after he unmasked, the NECW President Sheldon Goldberg, reversed the decision and declared Arion the winner, earning Arion a shot at the Triple Crown Championship at Genesis 8. After Bauer defeated the NECW Television Champion Handsome Johnny on December 13 to retain the Triple Crown Championship, a second match between the two of them January 10, 2009, was won by Bauer again, this time by disqualification. At Genesis 8, on February 21, Bauer defeated Alex Arion to retain his championship. At the following show, Arion interfered in Bauer's match, and hit him with a steel chair. This led to a rematch from Genesis on April 18, in which Bauer retained his championship, after hitting Arion with a steel chair to get himself intentionally disqualified. Bauer lost the title to Brandon Locke in Pembroke, Massachusetts, on February 27, 2010. Bauer had held the title for an NECW record of 22 months. =WWE (2012‚Äì2014)= In August 2012, it was reported that Bauer had signed for WWE and would report to their developmental territory NXT. He made his debut on October 24 on an NXT house show teaming with Corey Graves to defeat Ben Satterley and Trent Barretta. Bauer made his televised NXT debut on December 5 with the ring name Axl Keegan, in a loss to Bo Dallas. On the June 26 NXT, a renamed Mickey Keegan lost to Dallas again. Mickey is currently dealing with a career-threatening neck injury, specifically his spinal stenosis was getting narrowed after he had an MRI test recently. In December 2013, Keegan became an NXT creative assistant. After some months as creative, he quietly left the company.

A network of trails runs between the Davis and Nichewaug tracts; the Slab City tract is not connected to the other two parcels via trail. The East Branch of the Swift River passes through the Slab City and Nichewaug tracts. History and Conservation The reservation was farmland until the late 1880s. Small scale mill industries also stripped the area of trees. When farming migrated to the Midwest and the industries closed, the land became wooded again. The property contains cellar hole remains of farmsteads. Scenic vistas are located on the Slab City and Nichewaug tracts. The tracts were acquired in 1983 and 1985 by the Trustees of Reservations.

Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141 (1989), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding a state anti-plug molding law preempted because it partially duplicated and therefore interfered with the balance Congress had struck by federal patent law.. The decision reaffirmed the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. (1964),. which held a state unfair competition law preempted on the same ground. Background Bonito Boats developed a hull design for a fiberglass recreational boat and marketed it as the \\"Bonito 5VBR.\\" The manufacturing process involved creating a hardwood model that was then sprayed with fiberglass to create a mold. The mold then served to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale. No patent application was filed to protect the utilitarian or design aspects of the hull or the manufacturing process by which the finished boats were produced.489 U.S. at 144 After the Bonito 5VBR had been on the market for six years, the Florida Legislature enacted a \\"plug molding\\" statute that prohibits the use of a direct molding process to duplicate unpatented boat hulls, and forbids the knowing sale of hulls so duplicated. Bonito Boats then filed an action in a Florida Circuit Court, alleging that Thunder Craft Boats had violated the statute by using the direct molding process to duplicate the Bonito 5VBR fiberglass hull and by knowingly selling such duplicates. Bonito Boats sought damages, injunctive relief, and an award of attorney's fees under the Florida law.489 U.S. at 144-45. The Circuit Court granted Thunder Craft's s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute conflicted with federal patent law, and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution. The Florida Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed. The Federal Circuit had reached a contrary result in Interpart Corp. v. Italia, upholding a California law prohibiting plug molding. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. Opinion of the Court In a unanimous opinion for the Court, Justice O'Connor began by noting: This concern continued, and federal patent law ever since has been concerned with \\"the difficult business 'of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.'\\"489 U.S. at 148 (quoting Thomas Jefferson). This balance is reflected in the statutory line drawing as to the required degrees of novelty and nonobviousness for issuance of a patent: These novelty and nonobviousness requirements of patentability \\"embody a congressional understanding . . . that free exploitation of ideas will be the rule, to which the protection of a federal patent is the exception.\\" Accordingly, a parallel state law system could disturb the balance Congress struck\\" \\"State law protection for techniques and designs whose disclosure has already been induced by market rewards may conflict with the very purpose of the patent laws by decreasing the range of ideas available as the building blocks of further innovation.\\" Accordingly, \\"the federal patent laws must determine not only what is protected, but also what is free for all to use.\\"489 U.S. at 151. Thus, as such past decisions as Sears and Compco \\"have made clear that state regulation of intellectual property must yield to the extent that it clashes with the balance struck by Congress in our patent laws.\\" And: \\"Where it is clear how the patent laws strike that balance in a particular circumstance, that is not a judgment the States may second-guess.\\" The prior Supreme Court decisions \\"correctly concluded that the States may not offer patent-like protection to intellectual creations which would otherwise remain unprotected as a matter of federal law.\\"489 U.S. at 152-53, 156. The Federal Circuit, in its Interpart opinion argued that a plug-molding statute \\"prevents unscrupulous competitors\\" from taking advantage of the work of the originator while leaving later comers free to design and manufacture their own products, and \\"the patent laws say nothing about the right to copy or the right to use, they speak only in terms of the right to exclude.\\"489 U.S. at 163. The Court found this reasoning \\"defective.\\" First: \\"Appending the conclusionary label 'unscrupulous' to such competitive behavior merely endorses a policy judgment which the patent laws do not leave the States free to make.\\" That decision is left to the federal government and its determination was that copying the functional attributes of unpatented products that are in general circulation \\"is legitimate competitive activity.\\"489 U.S. at 164. Second, as for the Federal Circuit's proposition that the patent laws say \\"nothing about the right to copy or the right to use,\\" there is a federal right to copy and the Federal Circuit's \\"assertion to the contrary is puzzling, and flies in the face\\" of decisions interpreting Sears and Compco. Those cases require that \\"copying of the article itself that is unprotected by the federal patent and copyright laws cannot be protected by state law.\\"489 U.S. at 165. This is a field that Congress has fully occupied, leaving no room for parallel state regulation, whether conflicting, complementary, or supplemental: Impact and subsequent developments In 1998, Congress subsequently enacted the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act (VHDPA). as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, providing copyright- like or sui generis protection to boat hull designs, under a registration system something like that of the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act (SCPA).Since the VHDPA is a federal statute, it is not subject to preemption by the patent law or other federal statutory law, but it is possible that constitutional problems might exist under the patent clause of the Constitution. See generally Malla Pollack, The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Consideration, and Constitutional History, 28 61 (2002). This law creates ten years of copyright- like protection for boat hull designs.For a summary of the boat hull law, see the Copyright Office's analysis. The VHDPA was too late for Bonito Boats, however. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, Bonito Boats went out of business on July 16, 1991.Orlando Sentinel, \\"Boat Makers Flail Amid Sinking Sales\\" (May 25, 1992).

He established and administered the Franklinford Aboriginal Protectorate Station in the territory of the Dja Dja Wurrung people from January 1841 to the end of 1848. Early life Parker was born on 17 May 1802 in London to Edward Stone Parker, a printer and his wife Mary.http://press- files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p74381/pdf/ch0749.pdf He became an apprenticed printer and a Sunday school teacher in the Methodist Church and was a candidate for the ministry. He married Mary Cook Woolmer in 1828, thus breaking probationary conditions for the ministry leading him to teaching in a Methodist day school in Greater Queen Street, London. Assistant Protector The Colonial Office in England appointed him as assistant Protector of Aborigines, and he and his wife and six sons sailed for Sydney. He arrived in Melbourne in January 1839. Robinson appointed Parker to the northwest or Loddon District in March, but he did not start his protectorate until September 1839. The Protector's duties included to safeguard aborigines from \\"encroachments on their property, and from acts of cruelty, of oppression or injustice\\" and a longer term goal of \\"civilising\\" the natives. Parker initially established his base at Jackson's Creek near Sunbury, which was not close enough to the aboriginal nations of his protectorate. Parker suggested to Robinson and to Governor Gipps that protectorate stations be established within each district to concentrate aboriginals in one area and provide for their needs and so reduce frontier conflict. The Governor of NSW, Sir George Gipps, agreed and stations or reserves for each protector were approved in 1840. Parker's original choice for a reserve in September 1840 was a site, known as Neereman by the Dja Dja Wurrung, on Bet Bet Creek a tributary of the Loddon River. However, the site proved unsuitable for agriculture and in January 1841 Parker selected another site on the northern side of Mount Franklin on Jim Crow Creek with permanent spring water. This became known as the Loddon Aboriginal Protectorate Station at Franklinford, and was known to the Dja Dja Wurrung as Lalgambook. A Homestead, church, school and several out buildings were initially constructed. Parker employed a medical officer, Dr W. Baylie, to treat the high incidence of disease, a teacher to educate Dja Dja wurrung children, and employed several free and assigned labourers. Franklinford provided a very important focus for the Dja Dja Wurrung during the 1840s where they received a measure of protection and rations, but they continued with their traditional cultural practices and semi-nomadic lifestyle as much as they could. At times over 200 aborigines congregated at Franklinford. Initially Parker had wanted the station used by several tribes, but the Dja Dja Wurrung objected to this as the station was on their territory so mainmat or foreign people were limited to a very few. Parker also attempted to prosecute those European settlers who had killed aborigines including Henry Monro and his employees for killings in January 1840 and William Jenkins, William Martin, John Remington, Edward Collins, Robert Morrison for the murder of Gondiurmin in February 1841. Both cases were thrown out of court due to the inadmissibility of aboriginal witness statements and evidence in Courts of Law. Aboriginals were regarded as heathens, unable to swear on the bible, and therefore unable to give evidence. This made prosecution of settlers for crimes against aborigines exceedingly difficult, while also making it very difficult for aborigines to offer legal defences when they were prosecuted for such crimes as sheep stealing. Parker learnt the Dja Dja Wurrung language and over time became more acquainted with their culture and traditions. But his Christian proselytising met with only limited success. A few young Dja Dja Wurrung became Christian and settled into agricultural farming, but most people continued in the traditions and culture of the Dja Dja Wurrung. The protectorate ended on 31 December 1848, with about 20 or 30 Dja Dja Wurrung living at the station at that time. Parker and his family remained living at Franklinford. Six Dja Dja Wurrung men and their families settled at Franklinford, but all but one died from misadventure or respiratory disease. Tommy Farmer was the last survivor of this group who walked off the land in 1864 and joined the Coranderrk reserve. While chiefly remembered for his work as Assistant Protector, Parker was a leading layman and preacher in the Port Philip colony's Methodist community. He also served on the Council of the University of Melbourne in 1853, was a nominated member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 29 August 1853 to 1 August 1854; in 1857-62 he was an inspector for the Denominational Schools Board. In 1864, he unsuccessfully contested the seat of Creswick in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Legacy Edward Stone Parker's work as Assistant Protector of Aborigines has been described as \\"a successful failure\\". While the Franklinford Station he established to protect the Dja Dja Wurrung was eventually closed, he is remembered for his advocacy for land rights and reconciliation. He supported land ownership between Europeans and Aboriginal people. Without his journal observations of Aboriginal society, knowledge of many of their cultural practices could have been lost. Family Parker's first wife, Mary, died in 1842. Parker remarried in 1843. He died on 27 April 1865 at Franklinford, survived by his second wife Hannah, n√©e Edwards and by ten children. One son was George Alfred Parker, born 1859 and died 1916, whose son was Charles George Bright Parker, born 1897 and died 1938. Charles George Bright Parker married Kathleen Harley Wainwright / Bright-Parker OBE.

It is an indicator of the suitability of water for use in agricultural irrigation, as determined from the concentrations of the main alkaline and earth alkaline cations present in the water. It is also a standard diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil, as determined from analysis of pore water extracted from the soil. The formula for calculating the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is: : \\\\text{SAR} = \\\\frac{{Na^{+}}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}({Ca^{2+}+Mg^{2+}})}} where sodium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents/liter. SAR allows assessment of the state of flocculation or of dispersion of clay aggregates in a soil. Sodium and potassium ions facilitate the dispersion of clay particles while calcium and magnesium promote their flocculation. The behaviour of clay aggregates influences the soil structure and affects the permeability of the soil whose directly depends the water infiltration rate. It is important to accurately know the nature and the concentrations of cations at which the flocculation occurs: critical flocculation concentration (CFC). The SAR parameter is also used to determine the stability of colloids in suspension in water. Although SAR is only one factor in determining the suitability of water for irrigation, in general, the higher the sodium adsorption ratio, the less suitable the water is for irrigation. Irrigation using water with high sodium adsorption ratio may require soil amendments to prevent long-term damage to the soil. If irrigation water with a high SAR is applied to a soil for years, the sodium in the water can displace the calcium and magnesium in the soil. This will cause a decrease in the ability of the soil to form stable aggregates and a loss of soil structure and tilth. This will also lead to a decrease in infiltration and permeability of the soil to water, leading to problems with crop production. Sandy soils will have less problems, but fine-textured soils will have severe problems if SAR is greater than 9. When SAR is less than 3, there will not be a problem. The concept of SAR addresses only the effects of sodium on the stability of soil aggregates. However, high K and Mg concentrations have also negative effects on soil permeability. The effect of potassium can be similarly treated by means of the potassium adsorption ratio (PAR).Sposito Garrison (2008) The Chemistry of Soils. 2nd ed. New York. Oxford University Press. To take into account simultaneously all major cations present in water, a new irrigation water quality parameter was defined: the cation ratio of structural stability (CROSS), a generalization of SAR.

Produced during Ronald Reagan's first term as president, the Eagle Force toy line was marketed to send the message that the United States wasn't going to be \\"pushed around\\" anymore.Alexander, Ron. \\"Toy Fair Unwraps the Latest Offerings,\\" New York Times (Feb. 17, 1982). Designed by Bill Baron and Paul Kirchner,Kirchner, Paul. \\"Creating the Eagle Force,\\" Mego Museum (2005). Accessed Dec. 26, 2014. Eagle Force was similar to the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toy line, which was being developed by Hasbro during the same period.Mansour, David (2005). From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century. Andrews McMeel Publishing. p. 2. . The primary concept of Eagle Force is that it is an elite United States Government counter-terrorist task force organization composed of special forces experts. In their fictional universe, Eagle Force was created to combat the Roving International Organization of Tyranny (R.I.O.T.), a terrorist organization driven by the desire for world domination. Eagle Force is commanded by Captain Eagle, who wears an eye patch. The ethnically diverse cast of Eagle Force members include Big Bro, The Cat, Harley, Kayo, Redwing, Sgt. Brown, Stryker, Turk, Wild Bill, Zapper, and the female figure Goldie Hawk. R.I.O.T. is led by General Mamba, assisted by Baron Von Chill, Beta Man (an arsonist ), Nemesis the Saboteur, Savitar the Ninja, and a Shock Trooper figure.  Development  Mego's Vice President of Research and Development, Bill Baron, came up with the Eagle Force concept, which initially was called \\"Screaming Eagles,\\" the nickname of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division. When Kirchner was brought on board in April 1981, Baron had already sketched up a number of characters, including \\"Captain Claw\\" (later named Capt. Eagle), Goldie Hawk (the company assumed this figure would be used as a hostage), and a \\"hippie\\" character named \\"Sleeze\\" (later named \\"Tilt\\" and finally \\"Zapper\\"). The characters Turk and \\"Pot Luk\\" (later named Kayo) were based on two security guards at the Mego Corporations headquarters. The Baron Von Chill figure was an in-joke based on Bill Baron. Many of the Eagle Force characters were based on ethnic stereotypes, including Nemesis, an Arab terrorist; General Mamba was originally based on the African military dictator Idi Amin. Because of backlash concerns, General Mamba became Caucasian when his figure hit marketplace, and the Nemesis figure was not marketed in Europe. The first Eagle Force line included thirteen figures: Captain Eagle, Big Bro, The Cat, Goldie Hawk, Harley, Kayo, Stryker, Turk, Zapper, General Mamba, Beta Man, Savitar, and the Shock Trooper. Mego released five additional figures a short time later: Redwing, Sgt. Brown, Wild Bill, Baron Von Chill, and Nemesis. Vehicles and playsets included a mountain base (\\"Eagle Mountain\\"), a jet, two jeeps, and two tanks, all of which were based on existing products so no new high-cost molds had to be created. Eagle Mountain, for instance, was from Marx Toys' The Guns of Navarone playset with a few modifications. (Mego had recently acquired some Marx Toys trademarks and molding tools after that company's assets were liquidated.) In addition, Mego packaged bundles of products from the Eagle Force toy line in specialized \\"Adventure Packs\\": Communications, Ocean Patrol, Tactical, and Bivouac. The company also produced a range of Eagle Force-related comic books (penciled by Kirchner and inked by Ralph Reese), cap guns, and other items. Slight variations in packaging in the U.S. were common while in production by Mego; later, other companies began producing figures from the same molds. producing still more variations. Outside the United States the Eagle Force lineup included numerous variations in packaging, figure painting, and additional vehicles.  Product and sales history  Eagle Force was heavily promoted at the 1982 American International Toy Fair in New York City. In the U.S., Eagle Force was sold through Target stores in May 1982, where they instantly sold out. A second wave of figures was scheduled for 1983 release, but Mego abruptly closed down in 1982 so the second series was never produced.Eagle Force The Second Wave \\"Page One: The Good Guys!\\", Mego Museum. Accessed Dec. 26, 2014. After Mego's demise, Eagle Force action figures were re-released by the Ideal Toy Company (recently having been taken over by CBS Toys), in packages labeled \\"Strike Force\\" where \\"Eagle Force\\" had been printed on the Mego releases. Another company subsequently used the Eagle Force molds to create a line of figures called simply \\"Action Figure\\", using totally different packaging from Eagle Force packaging. Most of the Action Figure line were painted the same as the Eagle Force line, with a few obvious exceptions, as only a tan skin color was used for the figures' heads. As a result, the African-American Sergeant Brown figure became caucasian, and the Native American Redwing had a tan head with brown arms. In 2016, Fresh Monkey Fiction and Remco Toys ran a successful crowd funding campaign to produce a new line of Eagle Force toys under the title \\"Eagle Force Returns.\\" The new toys will be 4 inch scale and are expected to be available in 2018.

Early life and career Jones was born on June 26, 1912, and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Irene Catherine (n√©e Kenefick) and Charles Vernon Jones. His grandfather founded The Jones Store. He had a brother, William Kenefick Jones (who became a Marine lieutenant general). James Jones graduated from Shattuck Military School, Faribault, Minnesota, in 1930, and various law schools. He joined the International Harvester Company working as a sales representative. By 1937, he was sent to Africa where he furnished various agencies and contractors with specifications and data on motor trucks and tractors. He traveled extensively in northern and western Africa, from Dakar in Senegal, to the Province of Southwest Africa, and later to Casablanca, Morocco, to cover the area from Gibraltar to the mouth of the Congo River. During this time, he learned to speak several languages.Biography microfiche on James L. Jones, History Division, Headquarters Marine Corps. Military service Jones signed for commission in the United States Army Reserve, serving from September 13, 1933, to September 5, 1938. When World War II broke out, he departed Africa, due to the circumstances of military presence of Nazi Germany forces. While working in the Canal Zone, he applied for a commission in the United States Marine Corps upon the suggestion of his brother, William K. Jones. Although he was denied due to his age of 27, one of his references, the admiral in charge of the Caribbean area, persuaded General Holcomb, and Jones was subsequently approached by a colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a major asking him to resubmit his application. He did and transferred his army commission for a Marine commission in the Marine Forces Reserve on February 3, 1941, as a 2nd lieutenant.Stubbe, Ray W.

Originally called Majestic Theatre, the name was eventually changed to Schine's Athena before its current incarnation, The Athena Cinema. Today, it is owned by Ohio University. Current Ownership and Operation In 2001, the Athena went up for sale. However, there was no interest in operating the nearly century old cinema. It was later was contracted to Ohio University which sought to restore the building, reopening in February 2002. The University contracted the theater to an independent manager. When the lease was nearing expiration, a committee formed to decide how the theater could have a place within the university's mission, employing clusters of business students who added ideas of how the Athena should operate. The students and the committee decided that the Athena should continue as a movie theater and that the College of Fine Arts should run it. ‚ÄúOther recommendations included improving marketing, exploring linkages to the academic enterprise, connecting with more students, co- promoting with uptown businesses, looking at new programming that has community appeal and giving the theater a different niche than other local movie houses.‚Äù Ohio University Outlook, September 10, 2008 On September 19, 2008 the Athena reopened under the management of the College of Fine Arts and began screening art house as well as international films. The current director is Alexandra Kamody, an Ohio University alum and former student worker. The Athena is staffed with over 40 students, paid through Federal Work Study. History The Majestic, now known as the Athena, opened up in 1915 when the Bethel grocery store was evicted. The movie theater began showing movies that all the stars were in. The theater was such a low price, at 5 cents for a ‚Äúfour reeler movie‚Äù, that people would rather go to the theater than spend more money seeing something at an expensive opera house. The theater was getting in all the most popular movies from ‚ÄúEtta of the Footlights‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Good Little Devil‚Äù. The theater wanted to keep its prices low and show first run movies for their low price of 5 cents to please their Athens customers. The theater wasn't without its problems though. People of Ohio weren't ready for some of the more risqu√© movies. In Ohio, ‚ÄúBirth of a Nation‚Äù was not allowed to be shown. It took the Ohio Board of Censors two years to allow it, and even then you had to travel to either Columbus or Cincinnati to view it. Another movie that was fairly risqu√© and caused problems at the Athena was Theda Bara's ‚ÄúSin‚Äù. The only way the movie was able to be shown, and get past the Censor board, was to play off the movie that it was a depiction of what would happen if one commits a sin and also a study of human behavior. Student Involvement The Athena has always been a big part of Ohio University's history. The earliest noted school and student involvement was the conga line that formed in 1941 after winning the basketball game. The students, in pure ecstasy, formed a conga line and went into the Athena; danced down the aisle, crossed in front of the screen, then back out onto Court Street and continued down the street. Students have also always had a little hand in the pricing of tickets. In 1968, two students picketed the theater on a Friday night because of the increased ticket prices. The theater's ticket used to be $1.50, but then the theater announced that they were raising the price of an adult ticket to $2.00. Those students were outraged and decided that picketing was the best solution to lower the prices. Three days later the theater decided to speak with the original picketers. Since the number of picketers had increased from two to twenty by the end of the weekend, they decided to sit down and come to an agreement on what both parties felt was best for everyone. They decided to do a trial run and see what happened. They decided that they would now offer a matinee price of $1 if patrons came before 5pm and then at night, they would offer $2 movie tickets. If patrons took advantage of this trial run pricing scheme, then the managers offer this deal all the time. This pleased both parties and everyone went away happy. The student delegates encouraged people to take advantage of this deal, since it was only a trial run, to show the managers that they want this deal to stay. Scandal The Athena has had its fair share of scandal. The Athena, in 1972, switched showing ‚ÄúSexual Freedom in Denmark‚Äù for ‚ÄúNo Deposit, No Return‚Äù because of certain complaints. The mayor, Donald Barrett, sent the Captain of the Police department, Charles Cochran to check out the film to see what everyone in town was complaining about. The mayor claimed that it was the Captain's duty to check out the film and see if the complaints from citizens were warranted. The theater showed a very risqu√© movie in 1977 called ‚ÄúFantasy Girls‚Äù. Two cops went to see the movie and spoke with the manager. It was just a friendly chat but they did express their concern for such raunchy movies being shown at the theater. The Chief of Police, Ted Jones, told the theater to stop showing X-Rated movies. Although he would not say what would happen to the theater if they refused to stop showing X-Rated movies. The manager stopped showing the film but refused to stop showing widely accepted raunchy films such as ‚ÄúClockwork Orange‚Äù. A few days later, the Chief Jones said that he is ‚Äúnot comfortable with police officers making decisions‚Äù regarding what is obscene and what is not.

The bacteria secrete Dispersin B to release adherent cells from a mature biofilm colony by disrupting biofilm formation. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of linear polymers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamines found in the biofilm matrices. Poly-acetyl glucosamines are integral to the structural integrity of the biofilms of various Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria and are referred to as PIA (PNAG,PS/A) in Staphylococcus species and PGA in Escherichia coli.; By degrading the biofilm matrix, Dispersin B allows for the release of bacterial cells that can adhere to new surfaces close by and extend the biofilm or start new colonies. Currently there is interest in Dispersin B as a commercial anti-biofilm agent that could be combined with antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections. Structure of Poly-N- acetyl-D-glucosamine  Biological Function  Dispersin B is produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative oral bacterium, when it needs to detach and disperse adherent bacterial cells. A. actinomycetemcomitans forms asymmetric biofilm lobed colonies that release single cells or small clusters of bacterial cells, which can attach to nearby surfaces, form new colonies, and enable the biofilm to spread. A biofilm is a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that are synthesized by the bacteria. The biofilm's structural integrity is dependent on poly-N- acetylglucosamine (PGA), extracellular DNA, and proteinaceous adhesins. It allows bacteria to adhere to host surfaces, protects the bacterial cells from host defenses, results in increased resistance to antibiotics, and provides a protected environment with microchannels for the flow of water and other essential nutrients. By hydrolyzing PGA, Dispersin B disrupts the formation of the biofilm matrix and allows adherent cells to be released. Dispersin B has also been shown to cause the detachment of biofilm cells that have adhered to abiotic surfaces as well as cause the disaggregaton of highly auto-aggregated clumps of bacterial cells.  Enzyme Structure  Single Domain of Dispersin B: TIM Barrel (major substructure) shown in blue. Œ±-Helices are represented by cylinders and Œ≤-strands represented by arrows The three-dimensional structure of dispersin B was determined by expressing the protein in E. coli, purifying it from cultures, and crystallizing it in the orthoorhombic space group C2221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. It is a 361 amino acid protein consisting of a single domain. The major substructure consists of residues 1-60 and residues 91-358, which fold into a Œ≤/Œ± structure of a typical TIM barrel. The loop Œ≤4 contains two highly conserved residues Asp183 and Glu184 that are part of the enzyme's active site, a large cavity in the center of the bowl-shaped Dispersin B molecule. The oligomer substrate binding and cleaving at the active site of Dispersin B was studied to learn more about the enzymatic degradation. Reverse phase HPLC was used to analyze the products of the hydrolysis of substrates with differing degrees of polymerization. Chain lengthening of the substrate was shown to increase the catalytic efficiency of Dispersin B. A substrate with a degree of polymerization of five was not enough for total subsite occupancy. Carbamate substrates were also shown to improve the activity of the enzyme relative to the benchmark substrate 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-Œ≤-D-glucosamine. Enzyme Mechanism Dispersin B is a Œ≤-hexosaminidase that specifically hydrolyzes Œ≤-1,6-glycosidic linkages of acetylglucosamine polymers found in biofilm matrices. As a member of family 20 Œ≤-hexosaminidases, it cleaves terminal monosaccharide residues from the non- reducing end of the polymers. The active site of Dispersin B contains three highly conserved acidic residues: an aspartic acid at residue 183 (D183), a glutamic acid at residue 184 (E184), and a glutamic acid at residue 332 (E332). In the proposed mechanism, E184 serves as the acid/base and donates a proton to the -OR on C1. Crystallographic evidence suggests that substrate- assisted catalysis occurs and D183 is believed to assist in activating the N-acetyl group, which acts as a nucleophilic in an attack of C1. Water then attacks the anomeric centre to release the cleaved polymer from the active site with retention of anomeric configuration. (The mechanism shown below is thus incorrect). The use of the neighboring C2-acetamido group of the substrate differs from the majority of Œ≤-glycosidases, which use a carboxyl group as a nucleophile in their mechanisms. Although E332 is located farther away from the anomeric carbon, the lower activity of Dispersin B with the mutation E332Q suggests that it is important for catalysis. It may be critical in stabilizing the transition state of cleaving the terminal monosaccharide. : Active Site of Dispersin B: E184 shown in blue. D183 shown in pink. E332 shown in yellow. Proposed Mechanism of Dispersin B: E184 shown in blue. D183 shown in pink. E332 not shown.  Applications  Dispersin B may be useful for treating and preventing biofilm-associated infections caused by poly-N-acetylglucosamine-producing bacteria. Dispersin B prevented the formation of S. epidermidis biofilm, which suggests that biofilm-releasing enzymes can exhibit broad-spectrum activity and could be potential antibiofilm agents.  Commercial development  Dispersin B is being commercially developed as a wound care gel and medical device coating by Kane Biotech, Inc., a Canadian biotech company. External and internal catheters that were coated with a combination of Dispersin B and triclosan. These catheters were shown to be as effective at preventing bacterial infection as already commercially available chlorhexidine- sulfadiazine-coated catheters. These findings support that Dispersin B exhibits synergistic activity when combined with antibiotics. Carbamate substrates were also shown to improve the activity of the enzyme relative to the benchmark substrate 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-Œ≤-D-glucosamine. Pharmaceutical-grade Dispersin B has been successfully manufactured by BioVectra, Inc., Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canada, and is currently undergoing biocompatibility testing. Clinical trials to test the effectiveness of dispersin B for the treatment and prevention of diabetic foot ulcers and pressure sores should begin in 2010.

The aim of the Atlantic League to allow clubs who have been successful in their national competitions to participate in a more competitive league that would be more attractive to fans and television viewers, resulting in higher revenues and the ability to attract more talented players. An Atlantic League would aspire for itself and its clubs to achieve parity with the largest existing national leagues in England, Italy, Germany and Spain. 2000‚Äì01 proposals The first Atlantic League proposal was made by Peter Fossen and Harry van Raaij, chief executive officer and club president respectively at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. Fearing that their club would be left behind in terms of financial revenue and ability to attract star players relative to those that play in the largest European national leagues, they contacted a number of other clubs, both in the Netherlands and abroad, with large fanbases, with the proposition that they secede from their existing league competitions and form an international competition with one another. A plan was drawn up for a league featuring clubs from the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Scotland, plus a contingent from Scandinavian countries. Talks were held with Ajax, Feyenoord, Porto, Rangers and Celtic; Celtic were particularly receptive of the idea. The league was planned to begin in 2002 at the earliest, following the conclusion of television rights contracts in the affected countries. By 2001, Fossen had abandoned a parallel idea of setting up a completely Europe-wide league competition (the Euroleague) - he had forwarded this idea through the influential G-14 group of clubs, of which PSV was a member, but was forced to relent following opposition from clubs in the largest national leagues like England and Germany. He instead furthered his Atlantic League proposal, entering into discussions with UEFA's marketing director Lars-Christer Olsson with a project that now included the other Dutch and Scottish clubs contacted in the initial stage, plus S.L. Benfica and Sporting C.P. from Portugal's Liga Sagres, R.S.C. Anderlecht and Club Brugge K.V. from Belgium's Jupiler League, IFK G√∂teborg and AIK from Sweden's Allsvenskan, and Br√∏ndby IF and F.C. Copenhagen from Denmark's SAS Ligaen. A system of promotion and relegation would be maintained, with the least successful clubs relegated back to their national top leagues to be replaced by that league's champions. Qualification for the existing European club competitions (the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup) would be available through the league. With a target population of over 40 million in Atlantic League represented countries, and with a proposed average attendance of over 30,000, which would be the third largest of all European leagues, van Raaij hoped to secure a television contract comparable to that of the larger leagues. The Scottish Premier League (SPL) were actively involved in the negotiations, but other domestic leagues affected offered lucrative deals to clubs to remain in their national setup. UEFA chief executive Gerhard Aigner accepted the need for action in preventing the disparity between the largest clubs and the would-be Atlantic League participants, but during a two-day summit in Nyon, Switzerland in February 2001, ultimately rejected the proposal. He instead proposed a revamp of the UEFA Cup competition to try to redress the balance. With meetings still on- going between the Atlantic League group that September, UEFA insisted that if they broke away from the governing body to set up the league, they would suffer from no longer being able to compete in Europe-wide competition such as the Champions League. 2002 proposals By April 2002, Rangers and Celtic (collectively known as the Old Firm) were openly attempting to secede from the SPL and enter the English league system instead. van Raaij and PSV approached the pair with a new Atlantic League proposal, now featuring between 18 and 20 teams and no longer including the Scandinavian countries. Up to five places would have been awarded to Scottish clubs under the new proposal; significantly, this would allow clubs in the SPL other than the Old Firm to contest the competition. This development came just as those clubs threatened to resign from the league in protest at the dominance of the Old Firm. The new Atlantic League would again maintain promotion and relegation with the national top leagues and facilitate qualification for Europe-wide competition. North Atlantic League Cup In the autumn of 2003, representatives of the Dutch, Belgian, Danish and Scottish leagues proposed an alternative competition called the North Atlantic League Cup. It would feature the top four clubs from each of the four leagues in a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout tournament each January, although those still competing in the Champions League or UEFA Cup would be exempt from the competition. Celtic CEO Ian McLeod reassured UEFA that this competition would be complementary to, and not intended to replace, the existing national competitions, unlike the Atlantic League. UEFA replied that international competitions must take place under their jurisdiction, but were not opposed to the idea, only insisting that the national associations involved be in full agreement. 2008 resurrection In December 2008, Rangers manager Walter Smith admitted he would like to see his club competing in the Atlantic League, with a reserve team continuing to compete in the SPL - opining that the financial domination of the largest leagues has cheapened the appeal of the Champions League, as top clubs are able to field weakened teams and still able to qualify easily. The SPL remained open to the idea, but refused to enter into any negotiations until its existing television rights deal concludes in 2014. Scandinavian clubs were included again in media speculation over interested clubs, this time including Rosenborg BK from Norway's Tippeligaen.\\"Atlantic League Contenders\\". The Daily Telegraph, 29 December 2008 UEFA are likely to oppose the proposals once more, citing fear of the proliferation of non-national leagues.\\"Uefa would fight an Atlantic League every step of the way\\" The Daily Telegraph, 2 January 2009 2016 resurrection The plan was again discussed in the beginning of 2016 and talks have taken place throughout the year by representatives from the Netherlands, Belgium, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway according to Anders H√∏rsholt, the director of F.C. Copenhagen. Representatives of F.C. Copenhagen (Denmark), Ajax (The Netherlands), PSV (The Netherlands), Feyenoord (The Netherlands), Anderlecht (Belgium), Club Brugge (Belgium) Celtic (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), Malm√∂ FF (Sweden), Rosenborg (Norway) and HJK Helsinki (Finland) are believed to have taken part in the discussions. According to Toon Gerbrands (general director PSV) the talks are just in the initial stage. The main reason for the talks is to put pressure on the UEFA, to remind them there are more clubs than just the big ones from the three big competitions. Especially the plan to hand automatic places to the top four clubs from each of the top four nations the Champions league is causing unrest in the top clubs of the smaller football leagues.

It legally recognised the belligerent status of the Confederate States of America (CSA) but never recognised it as a nation and neither signed a treaty with it nor ever exchanged ambassadors. Over 90 percent of Confederate trade with Britain ended, causing a severe shortage of cotton by 1862. Private British blockade runners sent munitions and luxuries to Confederate ports in return for cotton and tobacco. In Manchester, the massive reduction of available American cotton caused an economic disaster referred to as a Cotton Famine. Despite the high unemployment, some Manchester cotton workers refused out of principle to process any cotton from America, leading to direct praise from President Lincoln, whose statue in Manchester bears a plaque which quotes his appreciation for the textile workers in \\"helping abolish slavery\\". Top British officials debated offering to mediate in the first 18 months, which the Confederacy wanted but the United States strongly rejected. The British elite tended to support the Confederacy, but ordinary people tended to support the United States, the Union or \\"the North\\". Large-scale trade continued between Britain and the whole of the US. The US shipped grain to Britain, and Britain sent manufactured items and munitions to the US. Immigration continued into the US, with many Britons volunteering for its army. British trade with the Confederacy fell over 90% from the prewar period, with a small amount of cotton going to Britain and some munitions and luxury goods slipped in by numerous small blockade runners. They were operated and funded by British private interests. They were legal under international law and caused no dispute between the US and Britain. The Confederate strategy for securing independence was based largely on the hope of military intervention by Britain and France. That never happened because the US threatened war, which would have cut off much of Britain's food supply. A serious diplomatic dispute erupted over the \\"Trent Affair\\" in late 1861 but was resolved peacefully after five weeks. British intervention was likely only in co-operation with France, which had an imperialistic venture underway in Mexico. By early 1863, intervention was no longer seriously considered, as Britain turned its attention elsewhere, especially toward Russia and Greece.Niels Eichhorn, \\"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\\" American Nineteenth Century History (2014) 14#2, pp. 287-310. A long-term issue was sales of warships to the Confederacy. A British shipyard (John Laird and Sons) built two warships for the Confederacy, including the CSS Alabama, over vehement protests from the US. Known as the Alabama Claims, the controversy was resolved peacefully after the Civil War when the US was awarded $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by the warships. The fact that British private interests operated blockade runners was not a cause of serious tension. In the end, British involvement did not significantly affect the outcome of the war.Stephen R. Wise, Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running During the Civil War (1991). The US diplomatic mission, headed by Minister Charles Francis Adams, Sr., proved to be much more successful than the Confederate missions, which were never officially recognized by Britain.Martin B. Duberman, Charles Francis Adams, 1807-1886 (1961), p. 333. Confederate policies Confederate opinion, led by President Jefferson Davis, was dominated by \\"King Cotton,\\" the idea that British dependence on cotton for its large textile industry would lead to diplomatic recognition and mediation or military intervention. The Confederates had not sent out agents ahead of time to ascertain if the King Cotton policy would be effective. Instead, it was by popular demand, not government action, that shipments of cotton to Europe were ended in spring 1861. When the Confederate diplomats arrived, they tried to convince British leaders that the US naval blockade was an illegal paper blockade.Charles M. Hubbard, \\"James Mason, the 'Confederate Lobby,' and the blockade debate of March 1862,\\" Civil War History (1999) 45#3 pp 223-37 Historian Charles Hubbard writes: > Davis left foreign policy to others in government and, rather than > developing an aggressive diplomatic effort, tended to expect events to > accomplish diplomatic objectives. The new president was committed to the > notion that cotton would secure recognition and legitimacy from the powers > of Europe. The men Davis selected as secretary of state and emissaries to > Europe were chosen for political and personal reasons ‚Äì not for their > diplomatic potential. This was due, in part, to the belief that cotton could > accomplish the Confederate objectives with little help from Confederate > diplomats.Hubbard, Burden Of Confederate Diplomacy (2000), p. 7 Hubbard added that Davis's policy was stubborn and coercive. The King Cotton strategy was resisted by the Europeans. Secretary of War Judah Benjamin and Secretary of the Treasury Christopher Memminger warned that cotton should be immediately exported to build up foreign credits.Hubbard, Burden Of Confederate Diplomacy, pp. 21-25. Union policies U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward (c. 1850) Lord Palmerston The Union's main goal in foreign affairs was to maintain friendly relations and large-scale trade with the world and to prevent any official recognition of the Confederacy by any country, especially Britain. Other concerns included preventing the Confederacy from buying foreign-made warships; gaining European support for policies against slavery; and attracting immigrant laborers, farmers, and soldiers. There had been continuous improvement in Anglo-American relations throughout the 1850s. The issues of Oregon, Texas and the border between the United States and the British colonies had all been resolved, and trade was brisk. Secretary of State William H. Seward, the primary architect of American foreign policy during the war, intended to maintain the policy principles that had served the country well since the American Revolution: \\"non-intervention by the United States in the affairs of other countries and resistance to foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States and other countries in this hemisphere.\\"Jones (1992), pp. 2-3. Hubbard, p. 17. Mahin, p. 12. British policies British public opinion was divided on the American Civil War. The Confederacy tended to have support from the elites: the aristocracy and the gentry, which identified with the landed plantation owners, and Anglican clergy and some professionals who admired tradition, hierarchy and paternalism. The Union was favored by the middle classes, the religious Nonconformists, intellectuals, reformers and most factory workers, who saw slavery and forced labor as a threat to the status of the workingman. The cabinet made the decisions. Chancellor of the Exchequer William E Gladstone, whose family fortune had been based on slavery in the West Indies before 1833, supported the Confederacy. Foreign Minister Lord Russell wanted neutrality. Prime Minister Lord Palmerston wavered between support for national independence, his opposition to slavery and the strong economic advantages of Britain remaining neutral.A.G. Hopkins American Empire: a global history (Princeton UP, 2018) pp 231-33. Even before the war started, Lord Palmerston pursued a policy of neutrality. His international concerns were centered in Europe, where he had to watch both Napoleon III's ambitions in Europe and Otto von Bismarck's rise in Prussia. There were also serious problems involving Italy, Poland, Russia, Denmark and China. British reactions to American events were shaped by past British policies and their own national interests, both strategically and economically. In the Western Hemisphere, as relations with the United States improved, Britain had become cautious about confronting it over issues in Central America. As a naval power, Britain had a long record of insisting that neutral nations abide by its blockades, a perspective that led from the earliest days of the war to de facto support for the Union blockade and frustration in the South.Berwanger, p. 874. Hubbard, p. 18. Baxter, The British Government and Neutral Rights, p. 9. Baxter wrote that \\"the British government, while defending the rights of British merchants and shipowners, kept one eye on the precedents and the other on the future interests of the mistress of the sea.\\" Diplomatic observers were suspicious of British motives. The Russian Minister in Washington, Eduard de Stoeckl, noted, \\"The Cabinet of London is watching attentively the internal dissensions of the Union and awaits the result with an impatience which it has difficulty in disguising.\\" De Stoeckl advised his government that Britain would recognize the Confederacy at its earliest opportunity. Cassius Clay, the United States Minister in Russia, stated, \\"I saw at a glance where the feeling of England was. They hoped for our ruin! They are jealous of our power. They care neither for the South nor the North. They hate both.\\"Graebner, p. 60-61. Lincoln appointed Charles Francis Adams, Sr., as minister to Britain. An important part of his mission was to make clear to the British that the war was a strictly-internal insurrection and afforded the Confederacy no rights under international law. Any movement by Britain to recognizing the Confederacy officially would be considered an unfriendly act toward the US. Seward's instructions to Adams included the suggestion that it should be made clear to Britain that a nation with widely scattered possessions, as well as a homeland that included Scotland and Ireland, should be very wary of \\"set[ting] a dangerous precedent.\\"Mahin, p. 47. Taylor, p. 177. Lord Lyons was appointed as the British minister to the United States in April 1859. An Oxford graduate, he had two decades of diplomatic experience before being given the American post. Lyons, like many British leaders, had reservations about Seward and shared them freely in his correspondence, which was widely circulated within the British government.Warren, pg. 82.Hubert F. Dubrulle, \\"Lord Lyons\\" in David Heidler, ed. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War pp. 1234-5. As early as January 7, 1861, well before the Lincoln administration had even assumed office, Lyons wrote to British Foreign Secretary Lord Russell about Seward: Despite his distrust of Seward, throughout 1861, Lyons maintained a \\"calm and measured\\" diplomacy that contributed to a peaceful resolution to the Trent crisis. Slavery The Confederate States came into existence after seven of the fifteen slave states seceded because of the election of Republican President Lincoln, whose party committed to the containment of slavery geographically and the weakening of slaveowners' political power. Slavery was the cornerstone of the South's plantation economy, although it was repugnant to the moral sensibilities of most people in Britain, which had abolished slavery in its Empire in 1833. Until the fall of 1862, the immediate end of slavery was not an issue in the war; in fact, some Union states (Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and what became West Virginia) allowed slavery. In 1861, Missouri had sought to extradite an escaped slave from Canada to face trial for a murder committed in his flight for which some in Britain falsely believed the punishment was to be burned alive.Duncan Andrew Campbell, English Public Opinion and the American Civil War, (2003), pp. 26-7.R.J.M Blackett, Divided Hearts: Britain and the American Civil War, (2001), pp. 54-5.Richard Huzzey, Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain, (2012), p. 56. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, announced in preliminary form in September 1862, made ending slavery an objective of the war and caused European intervention on the side of the South to be unpopular. However, some British leaders expected it would cause a large-scale race war that might need foreign intervention. Pro-Southern leaders in Britain then spoke of mediation, which they understood to mean the independence of the Confederacy and the continuation of slavery.Howard Jones, Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: the Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War, (1999) Trent Affair Outright war was a possibility in late 1861, when the U.S. Navy took control of a British mail ship and seized two Confederate diplomats. Confederate President Jefferson Davis had named James M. Mason and John Slidell as commissioners to represent Confederate interests in England and France. They went to Havana, in Spanish Cuba, where they took passage for England on the British mail steamer Trent.Norman B. Ferris, The Trent Affair: A Diplomatic Crisis (1977) The American warship USS San Jacinto under Captain Charles Wilkes was looking for them. It was generally then agreed that a nation at war had the right to stop and search a neutral merchant ship if it suspected that ship of carrying the enemy's dispatches. Mason and Slidell, Wilkes reasoned, were in effect Confederate dispatches and so he had the right to remove them. On November 8, 1861, he fired twice across the bow of the Trent, sent a boat's crew aboard, seized the Confederate commissioners, and bore them off in triumph to the US, where they were held prisoner in Boston. Wilkes was hailed as a national hero. The violation of British neutral rights triggered an uproar in Britain. Britain sent 11,000 troops to Canada, and the British fleet was put on a war footing with plans to blockade New York City if war broke out. In addition, the British put an embargo on the export of saltpetre which the US needed to make gunpowder. Approximately 90% of the world's natural reserves of saltpetre were in British territory and the US had a purchasing commission in London buying up every ounce it could get.James M McPherson \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\". A sharp note was dispatched to Washington to demand the return of the prisoners as an apology. Lincoln, concerned about Britain entering the war, ignored anti-British sentiment, issued what the British interpreted as an apology without actually apologizing, and ordered the prisoners to be released. Britain's shortage of cotton was partially made up by imports from India and Egypt; Punch cartoon 16 November 1861. War was unlikely in any event, as not only was the United States importing saltpetre from Britain it was also providing Britain with over 40% of its wheat imports during the war years, and suspension would have caused severe disruption to its food supply. Britain imported about 25-30% of its grain (\\"corn\\" in British English), and poor crops in 1861 and 1862 in France made Britain even more dependent on shiploads from New York City. Furthermore, British banks and financial institutions in the City of London had financed many projects such as railways in the US. There were fears that war would result in enormous financial losses as investments were lost and loans defaulted on. Britain's shortage of cotton was partially made up by imports from India and Egypt by 1863.Ginzberg, (1936) The Trent Affair led to the Lyons-Seward Treaty of 1862, an agreement to clamp down hard on the Atlantic slave trade by using the US Navy and the Royal Navy. Possibility of recognizing Confederacy The possibility of recognizing the Confederacy came to the fore late in the summer of 1862. At that time, as far as any European could see, the war seemed to be a stalemate. The US attempt to capture the Confederate capital had failed, and in the east and west alike, the Confederates were on the offensive. Charles Francis Adams, Sr., warned Washington that the British government might very soon offer to mediate the difficulty between North and South, which would be a polite but effective way of intimating that in the opinion of Britain, the fight had gone on long enough and should be ended by giving the South what it wanted. Recognition, as Adams warned, risked all-out war with the United States. War would involve an invasion of Canada, a full-scale American attack on British shipping interests worldwide, an end to American grain shipments that were providing a large part of the British food supply, and an end to British sales of machinery and supplies to the US.Martin B. Duberman, Charles Francis Adams, 1807-1886 (1961); Van Deusen (1967) The British leadership, however, thought that if the Union armies were decisively defeated, the US might soften its position and accept mediation.Ephraim Douglass Adams, Great Britain and the American Civil War (1925) Earl Russell, British Foreign Secretary, had given Mason no encouragement, but after news of the Second Battle of Bull Run reached London in early September, Palmerston agreed that in late September, there could be a cabinet meeting at which Palmerston and Russell would ask approval of the mediation proposal. Then, Russell and Palmerston decided not to bring the plan before the cabinet until they got further word about Lee's invasion of the North. If the Northerners were beaten, the proposal would go through; if Lee failed, it might be well to wait a little longer before taking any action.Jones (1992) ch 8-10 The British working-class population, most notably the British cotton workers who suffered the Lancashire Cotton Famine, remained consistently opposed to the Confederacy. A resolution of support was passed by the inhabitants of Manchester and sent to Lincoln. His letter of reply has become famous: There is now a statue of Lincoln in Manchester, with an extract from his letter carved on the plinth. Lincoln became a hero amongst the British working class with progressive views. His portrait, often alongside that of Garibaldi, adorned many parlour walls. One can still be seen in the boyhood home of David Lloyd George, now part of the Lloyd George Museum. The decisive factor, in the fall of 1862 and increasingly thereafter was the Battle of Antietam and what grew out of it. Lee's invasion was a failure at Antietam, and he barely escaped back to Virginia. It was now obvious that no final, conclusive Confederate triumph could be anticipated. The swift recession of the high Confederate tide was as visible in Britain as in America, and in the end, Palmerston and Russell dropped any notion of bringing a mediation-recognition program before the cabinet. Emancipation Proclamation During the late spring and early summer of 1862, Lincoln had come to see that he must broaden the base of the war. The Union itself was not enough; the undying vitality and drive of Northern anti-slavery men must be brought into full, vigorous support of the war effort and so the United States chose to declare itself officially against slavery. The Lincoln administration believed that slavery was the basis of the Confederate economy and leadership class and that victory required its destruction. Lincoln had drafted a plan and waited for a battlefield victory to announce it. The Battle of Antietam gave Lincoln victory, and on September 22, he gave the Confederacy 100 days notice to return to the Union or else on January 1, 1863, all slaves held in areas in rebellion would be free. William Ewart Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and a senior Liberal leader, had accepted slavery in his youth; his family had grown wealthy through the ownership of slaves in the West Indies. However, the idea of slavery was abhorrent to him, and his idea was to civilise all nations. He strongly spoke out for Confederate independence. When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, he tried to make the counterargument that an independent Confederacy would do a better job of freeing the slaves than an invading northern army would. He warned that a race war was imminent and would justify British intervention. Emancipation also alarmed the British Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell, who expected a bloody slave uprising. The question then would be British intervention on humanitarian grounds. However, there was no slave uprising and no race war. The advice of the war minister against going to war with United States, as well as the tide of British public opinion, convinced the cabinet to take no action. Confederate diplomacy Once the war with the US began, the best hope for the survival of the Confederacy was military intervention by Britain and France. The US realized that as well and made it clear that recognition of the Confederacy meant war and the end of food shipments into Britain. The Confederates who had believed in \\"King Cotton\\" (Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton for its industries) were proven wrong. Britain, in fact, had ample stores of cotton in 1861 and depended much more on grain from the US.Ginzberg (1936) During its existence, the Confederate government sent repeated delegations to Europe; historians do not give them high marks for diplomatic skills. James M. Mason was sent to London as Confederate minister to Queen Victoria, and John Slidell was sent to Paris as minister to Napoleon III. Both were able to obtain private meetings with high British and French officials, but they failed to secure official recognition for the Confederacy. Britain and the US were at sword's point during the Trent Affair in late 1861. Mason and Slidell had been seized from a British ship by an American warship. Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, helped calm the situation, and Lincoln released Mason and Slidell and so the episode was no help to the Confederacy.Ferris (1977) Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary Lord Russell, Napoleon III, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, explored the risks and advantages of recognition of the Confederacy or at least offering a mediation. Recognition meant certain war with the US, loss of American grain, loss of exports, loss of investments in American securities, potential invasion of Canada and other North American colonies, higher taxes, and a threat to the British merchant marine with little to gain in return. Many party leaders and the general public wanted no war with such high costs and meager benefits. Recognition was considered following the Second Battle of Manassas, when the British government was preparing to mediate in the conflict, but the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, combined with internal opposition, caused the government to back away.Jones (1999) In 1863, the Confederacy expelled all foreign consuls (all of them British or French diplomats) for advising their subjects to refuse to serve in combat against the US.Berwanger (1994) Throughout the war, all European powers adopted a policy of neutrality, meeting informally with Confederate diplomats but withholding diplomatic recognition. None ever sent an ambassador or official delegation to Richmond. However, they applied principles of international law and recognized both sides as belligerents. Canada allowed both Confederate and Union agents to work openly within its borders.Graebner (1960) Postwar adjustments and Alabama claims Northerners were outraged at British tolerance of non-neutral acts, especially the building of warships. The United States demanded vast reparations for the damages caused by British-built commerce raiders, especially CSS Alabama, which Palmerston bluntly refused to pay. The dispute continued for years after the war. After Palmerston's death, Prime Minister Gladstone agreed to include the US war claims in treaty discussions on other pending issues, such as fishing rights and border disputes. In 1872, pursuant to the resultant Treaty of Washington, an international arbitration board awarded $15,500,000 to the US, and the British apologized for the destruction caused by the British-built Confederate ships but admitted no guilt.Merli (2004) Long-term impact The Union victory emboldened the forces in Britain that demanded more democracy and public input into the political system. The resulting Reform Act 1867 enfranchised the urban male working class in England and Wales and weakened the upper-class landed gentry, who identified more with the Southern planters. Influential commentators included Walter Bagehot, Thomas Carlyle, John Stuart Mill, and Anthony Trollope.Brent E. Kinser, The American Civil War in the Shaping of British Democracy (Ashgate, 2011) Additionally, many Irishmen saw service in both the Union and Confederate State Army.

It was the first government-run university in modern China where western science & technology was its main focus. The school motto was \\"Seeking truth from facts\\"ÔºàÂÆû‰∫ãÊ±ÇÊòØ). It is now Tianjin University. In 1912, it was renamed National Peiyang University, and the following year it was renamed National Peiyang University. In 1917, Peiyang University merged into Peking University. By 1920, Peiyang University began to specialize in engineering education. In 1928, the National Government promoted the university district system. During this period, the school was renamed as the Second Institute of Engineering at National Peiping University. The following year the university district system was abolished. The original Peiyang University was retired from Peking University. Because it was specialized in engineering, it was not in accordance with the university system. Peiyang Institute of Technology. In 1937, due to the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the National Peiyang Institute of Technology moved west to Xi'an to form the National Xi‚Äôan Ad-hoc University and was renamed the National Northwest Associated University in March of the following year. In July, it was reorganized into the National Northwestern Institute of Technology. In 1943, under the auspices of Peiyang University's alumni reunification, the Ministry of Education independently designated Yingsi University‚Äôs College of Engineering and established the Taishun Peiyang Institute of Technology. Affected by this, Peiyang University alumni established Xijing Branch of Peiyang Institute of Technology in Xi‚Äôan. In 1945, when the War of Resistance against Japan ended, Peiyang University alumni's call for returning to Tianjin was growing louder. In January 1946, the Ministry of Education ordered Taishun Peiyang Institute of Technology, Peiyang Institute of Technology Xijing Branch and National Northwestern Engineering College to return to Tianjin for re-establishment. National Peiyang University was demobilized at the site of Xigu, Tianjin, and civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, and mining engineering were established. The five engineering research institutes of metallurgical engineering and chemical engineering actively carry out academic exchanges and scientific research and are known as the ‚Äúscience fortress building a nation‚Äù. In 1951, the National Peiyang University was merged with the Hebei Institute of Technology and named Tianjin University. At present, the campus site of Peiyang University is on the campus of Hebei University of Technology. The existing buildings include Tuancheng, Nanlou and North Buildings. In May 2013, the site of Peiyang University was upgraded to a national key cultural relics protection unit. In September 2016, the site of Peiyang University was selected as one of the first Chinese Architectural Heritage Lists in the 20th Century. Since Tianjin University has inherited the academic ties of Peiyang University, Tianjin University is currently holding the annual celebration of Tianjin University (Northern University) on October 2. Tianjin University has successively established Peiyang Square, 100th Anniversary Peiyang Memorial Pavilion, Peiyang Science Building, 120th Anniversary Peiyang Memorial Pavilion, etc. The celebration of Peiyang University Hall was established in October 1895.  School name  Research on the initial school name = The name originally used when Peiyang University was founded and the official opening date had a variety of arguments because the files were burned and there was no way to verify. One view is that the name of Peiyang University was \\"Tianjin Peiyang Chinese and Western School\\" (Â§©Ê¥•ÂåóÊ¥ã‰∏≠Ë•øÂ≠¶Â†Ç) at the beginning of its establishment. This statement originated from the \\"Tianjin Chinese and Western School Constitution\\"Ôºà„ÄäÂ§©Ê¥•‰∏≠Â≠¶Â≠¶Â†ÇÁ´†Á®ã„Äã) prepared by Sheng Xuanhuai and the \\"Arrangement of the Constitution of the Tianjin Chinese and Western School\\"Ôºà„ÄäÊãüËÆæÂ§©Ê¥•‰∏≠Ë•øÂ≠¶Â†ÇÁ´†Á®ãÁ¶Ä„Äã) proposed by Sheng Xuanhuai. Another argument stems from the fact that the Governor of Zhili Province, Wang Wenshao, wrote a memorial to Emperor Guangxu for the purpose of creating a Western School by the head of customs by Sheng XuanhuaiÔºà„ÄäÊ¥•Êµ∑ÂÖ≥ÈÅìÁõõÂÆ£ÊÄÄÂàõÂäûË•øÂ≠¶Â≠¶Â†ÇÁ¶ÄÊòéÁ´ãÊ°àÁî±„Äã). The memorial uses the name of ‚ÄúTianjin Peiyang Western School‚ÄùÔºàÂ§©Ê¥•ÂåóÊ¥ãË•øÂ≠¶Â≠¶Â†Ç). Therefore, Peiyang UniversityÔºàÂåóÊ¥ãÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â†Ç) is presumed to be under construction. It was originally named \\"Tianjin Peiyang Western School\\"ÔºàÂ§©Ê¥•ÂåóÊ¥ãË•øÂ≠¶Â≠¶Â†Ç) and was later renamed \\"Peiyang University\\"ÔºàÂåóÊ¥ãÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â†Ç). This is a common saying. This was adopted in the Peiyang University-Tianjin University History published by Tianjin University Press in 1990. However, scholars who specialize in the history of Peiyang University have verified based on historical data. In fact, when Peiyang University was founded, the initial names of the schools were Peiyang UniversityÔºàÂåóÊ¥ãÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â†Ç), Peiyang UniversityÔºàÂåóÊ¥ãÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â†Ç) and its English ‚ÄúPei-yang-ta- hsiieh-t'ang\\" appeared in the 1895 Peiking Tientisn Times and Zhili Province Times. Because the school used the \\"Tianjin Chinese and Western School Constitution\\" approved by Emperor Guangxu, it caused misinformation.

After Florida became a U.S. territory, its name was changed to Fort Marion. Today a national park site, its name was officially restored to the Castillo de San Marcos. During most of the American Civil War the Florida city of St. Augustine was under Union control. Its Confederate history was exceedingly brief. One Union general and one Confederate general were natives of the Ancient City. Many officers on both sides (including Union General William T. Sherman and Confederate General Braxton Bragg) had previous military experience in St. Augustine, particularly during the Second Seminole War. The city's historic (and endangered) Sea Wall was built in the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s by West Point engineers who went on to design military fortifications for both sides in the Civil War. Many black Union soldiers either came from St. Augustine, or settled there after the war, providing a leadership cadre for the community known as Lincolnville that was established in 1866. Many of the city's old cemeteries feature the distinctive marble tombstones marked \\"USCT\\"--United States Colored Troops. Florida state militia took the fort at St. Augustine from a small U. S. Army garrison (one soldier) on January 7, 1861. Three days later the state of Florida seceded from the United States. Union troops reoccupied the city on March 11, 1862, putting St. Augustine under Union control. The city was never retaken by Confederate forces. Early war After the assault on Harper's Ferry by abolitionist John Brown in 1859, St. Augustine Examiner owner Matthias Andreu devised the motto \\"Equality in the Union and Nothing Else\\", feeding a sense of mistrust towards the federal government that the paper promised could lead to war between the states.Fretwell p. 19 Once Abraham Lincoln was elected United States president solely by Northern states (not a single vote for Lincoln was recorded in the entire state of Florida), Andreu saw no hope in the south remaining with the north, and promoted secession, lest \\"violent abolitionists\\" incite slaves to riot. On January 7, 1861, at least 25 militiamen from the town of Fernandina came to capture Fort Marion, a coquina fort built by the Spanish between 1672 and 1695. The lone United States army sergeant guarding the fort gave the Southerners the keys without complaint. Many of the fort's cannons were sent to Fernandina.Fretwell p. 68 When news reached St. Augustine on January 12, 1861 that Florida had seceded, the city celebrated with ceremonial flag raisings, church bells, and musket volleys, followed that night by torchlight parade and bonfires. The following Lent saw greater passion in following the restrictions than previous years. Meanwhile, the Examiner led an effort to proclaim anything that spoke against secession as treasonous.Fretwell pp. 20‚Äì21 Initial support for the war waned when taxes were increased for the war effort and revenues derived from the new tourist trade came to a standstill.History of St. Augustine Augustine.com, Accessed January 1, 2009 Although situated 150 miles away, the residents of St. Augustine heard of the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861. Troops on a Union ship just upwind from the battle saw flashes of light, but often heard nothing.Heidler p. 8 The majority of Confederate forces from St. Augustine consisted of a company called the St. Augustine Blues. When they left the city in March 1862 their number ranged between eighty and a hundred men. As part of the Third Florida Regiment, they lost many of their men at the Battle of Perryville in Kentucky in October 1862. By the time of the Battle of Murfreesboro, only ten of the original Blues remained. At the war's end in 1865, only eight were officially captured. However, only seventeen were confirmed killed during the war.Fretwell pp. 86‚Äì87 Fort Marion and St. Augustine were seized by Union Marines and sailors landing unopposed on March 11, 1862. The and were spotted entering the bay on March 9 by the occupying Confederate forces. Knowing they could not adequately defend the city, the Confederate forces withdrew on March 10 at 10 pm.Fretwell p. 76Heidler p. 1252 Late war St. Augustine native Edmund Kirby-Smith Other notable contributions to the Confederate war effort were at least three generals: Edmund Kirby-Smith, Francis A. Shoup and William Wing Loring, although only Kirby-Smith was born there. During the war, St. Augustinian Stephen Vincent Benet, grandfather of American author Stephen Vincent Benet, continued to serve in the U.S. Army as an instructor at West Point with the rank of captain, eventually rising to the rank of Brigadier General.Stephen Vinvent Benet, Brigadier General, United States Army. Arlingtoncemetery.net. Retrieved on 2012-04-19. His younger brother James served in the Confederate Army‚Äîone of many examples of families divided in their loyalty during the war. Edmund Jackson Davis, while born in St. Augustine, moved to Galveston, Texas, as a child. After the war began, he crossed over to Mexico where he raised the 1st Texas Cavalry (USA), served as its colonel, and was later promoted to Brigadier General of U.S. Volunteers. In 1869, he was elected governor of Texas and served as such for four years.Warner pp. 114‚Äì115. Unlike nearby Jacksonville, which had four separate control changes, the Confederates did not attempt retaking St. Augustine.Heidler p. 696 Confederate general Robert E. Lee, well familiar with the area after having charted the coastline years before, said that the city \\"serves only as an invitation for an attack\\".Nolan p.32 Union forces strengthened the fort during the war, in case of attack. A heavy presence of U.S. Army forces would remain through Reconstruction and until the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, always as an important part of the local economy and social life. Many Union soldiers settled permanently in St. Augustine and intermarried with local families. Several served as mayors of the city. Lieutenant Foster, a Union officer, married Miss Sanchez, from a family of Confederate firebrands, and their son, General J. Clifford R. Foster, served as Adjutant General of Florida for most of the first quarter of the twentieth century. Union forces enjoyed the city. The Seventh New Hampshire Volunteers' historian said that living in St. Augustine was good for the health of his fellow soldiers, and regretted when ordered to leave the city. Another benefit from the Union presence was that Sam A. Cooley, an official photographer of the U.S. Army's Department of the South, undertook the first major effort to take pictures of many of the city's buildings, which proved valuable a century later when efforts were made to restore many of St. Augustine's historic buildings.Nolan pp. 32‚Äì34 Among the interesting Union soldiers to serve in St. Augustine were Joseph Hawley, later governor and senator from Connecticut, Francis Wayland Parker, pioneer of progressive education in the United States, Joseph C. Abbott, later senator from North Carolina, and Anthony Comstock, who became the nation's most notorious bookburner and anti-pornography crusader. On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation came into effect for slaves in areas still under Confederate control. A bell and marker on the grounds of Old St. Augustine Village celebrates the event, and for many generations, Emancipation Day, on January 1, was a major celebration in the black community of the Ancient City. On March 9, 1863, a small skirmish occurred when 80 Confederate troops attacked an advanced picket guard just north of St. Augustine. They were driven off by 120 men from the 7th New Hampshire Volunteers.http://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonhistorypageamericanstaugustinecivilwarb.htmlhttp://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonunionaccountofstaugustineattackmarch121863.html Post-war For many decades after the war, St. Augustine had two chapters of the Grand Army of the Republic‚Äîone black and one white. In the Flagler era, two prominent Union generals, John McAllister Schofield and Martin D. Hardin retired, sequentially, to the same house at 20 Valencia Street. Saved by public protest from a demolition attempt by Flagler College in the 1980s, the building has come to be known as \\"The Union Generals House.\\" Hardin, a prot√©g√© of Abraham Lincoln, was one of the last surviving generals on either side when he died in St. Augustine on December 12, 1923.Warner. p. 206 He is buried at the U.S. National Cemetery on Marine Street under a large cross, and a marker on the La Leche Chapel on the grounds of the Mission of Nombre de Dios notes that the building was restored in General Hardin's honor by his widow.

The plug is the core around which the walls of the mold are formed and the contours of which the mold replicates in reverse.See Outrigger Hull Design Protection. Technology The Federal Circuit described plug molding technology in these terms, in its decision in the Interpart case, discussed below: > The California plug molding statute ... proscribes use of the product itself > for a pattern or \\"plug\\" in a direct molding process. In that process, the > product is entirely coated with a mold-forming substance that sets and which > is then removed from the product and used as the mold for making numerous > replicas of the product. This process is substantially less expensive than > developing a mold from scratch, something the original product manufacturer > has to do. Legal challenges Interpart case = Plug molding statutes have been challenged as interfering with the federal patent system and therefore preempted by federal law. In 1985 in Interpart Corp. v. Italia,777 F.2d 678 (Fed. Cir. 1985). the Federal Circuit upheld the California anti-plug molding law against a preemption challenge, when it was invoked to stop copying of an automobile rear view mirror. The court said that the law \\"prevents unscrupulous competitors from obtaining a product and using it as the 'plug' for making a mold.\\" The Federal Circuit insisted that there is no \\"right to copy.\\" It therefore concluded: > The California law does not \\"clash\\" with the federal patent law; the two > laws have different objectives. ... [W]e see nothing in the federal patent > statutes that conflicts with California's desire to prevent a particular > type of competition which it considers unfair. = Bonito Boats case = Subsequently, in Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,489 U.S. 141 (1989). in 1989 the United States Supreme Court held the Florida anti-plug molding law preempted because it partially duplicated and therefore interfered with federal patent law.At the time of the Bonito Boats decision there were some twelve state laws of this kind. See Preemption of Direct Molding Statutes, 3 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 167, 175 n.3 (1990). The decision reaffirmed the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.,376 U.S. 225 (1964). which held a state unfair competition law preempted on the same ground. The Supreme Court commented adversely on the Interpart decision. First, the Court brushed aside the Federal Circuit's characterization of the law as one preventing \\"unscrupulous\\" behavior: > Appending the conclusionary label \\"unscrupulous\\" to such competitive > behavior [i.e., copying] merely endorses a policy judgment which the patent > laws do not leave the States free to make. Where an item in general > circulation is unprotected by patent, reproduction of a functional attribute > is legitimate competitive activity. The Court then turned to the Federal Circuit's rejection of a \\"right to copy\\": > For almost 100 years, it has been well established that, in the case of an > expired patent, the federal patent laws do create a federal right to \\"copy > and to use.\\" Sears and Compco extended that rule to potentially patentable > ideas which are fully exposed to the public. ... By offering patent-like > protection for ideas deemed unprotected under the present federal scheme, > the Florida statute conflicts with the \\"strong federal policy favoring free > competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.

An electrochemical wave called an action potential travels along the axon of a neuron. When the wave reaches a synapse, it provokes release of a puff of neurotransmitter molecules, which bind to chemical receptor molecules located in the membrane of another neuron, on the opposite side of the synapse. Schematic of a chemical synapse between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another. Synapses are specialised minute gaps between neurons. The electrical impulses arriving at the axon terminal triggers the release of packets of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters), which diffuse across the synaptic cleft to receptors on the adjacent dendrite temporarily affecting the likelihood that an electrical impulse will be triggered in the latter neuron. Once released the neurotransmitter is rapidly metabolised or is pumped pack into a neuron. Drawing by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum. (A) Denotes Purkinje cells, an example of a bipolar neuron. (B) Denotes which are multipolar. Wade G. Regehr is a Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School's Department of Neurobiology. Early biography Born in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, Canada, Regehr attended the University of Regina in Canada where he received the Governor General's Award, then received his Ph.D. at Caltech in applied physics with David Rutledge. His doctorate was at the interface between neuroscience and electrical engineering. Research Regehr's laboratory studies the implication of calcium Ca2+ as it affects synaptic strength. Neurons communicate with one another via synapses. Regehr was one of the first to use fluorescent imaging to see the synaptic activity occurring in the brain. A dye alters the fluorescence properties when attached to calcium, and changes in intracellular calcium are associated with neuronal activity (firing of action potentials). Using fluorescence-microscopy techniques, calcium levels are detected, and therefore the influx of calcium in the presynaptic neuron. Calcium processes affect the release of neurotransmitter from the axon terminal. (Occasionally this happens in reverse). Chemical synapses are characterized by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with postsynaptic receptors. A neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that is synthesized within neurons themselves and released by these same neurons to communicate with their postsynaptic target cells. By studying the physiological process and mechanisms, a further understanding is made of synaptic depression and delayed release of the neurotransmitter, synaptic potentiation, facilitation and other calcium dependent chemical processes. Awards Regehr received the Governor General's Award after receiving his undergraduate degree from the University of Regina. Regehr has been awarded the Senator Jacob Javits Award in the Neurosciences. This award provides funding for a possible seven years to research neurological disorders. The funding is provided by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Regehr's study of short term synaptic plasticity (synapse strength during behavioral tasks) is relevant to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression. Regehr also was granted a scholar award from The McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience for The Role of Presynaptic Calcium in Plasticity at Central Synapses in 1993. The McKnight Scholar Awards are given to PhD candidates who have an interest in the study of disorders affecting learning and memory. The funding establishes laboratories for emerging neuroscientists who can develop clinical neuroscience research.

The route followed the shores of the Delaware River as Lackawaxen Road. The route's alignment, after assignment in 1928, remained the same until being removed from the state highway system in 1946. The route was paved in 1932, and the route is now known as State Route 1012 (SR 1012) and Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454.  Route description  The alignment of PA 237 began at an intersection with its parent highway, PA 37 in Lackawaxen Township, near Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct. This is currently the intersection with PA 590. The highway heads eastward along the banks of the Delaware River and a nearby railroad track towards Shohola Township. There is an intersection with Delaware Drive just after the inception. Delaware Drive heads to a dead-end at the banks of the Delaware River. The highway passes some homes to the north and a dense forest to the south. There is also a mansion atop a nearby hill. After a clearing, the highway enters the dense forest completely and turns to the southeast. With the train tracks, Delaware River and New York State Route 97 paralleling to the north, the highway begins a southeastern track. There are some occasional clearings, The old alignment of PA 237 passes a pond as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks with the forests becoming a majority the surroundings. The old alignment of PA 237 passes a pond, as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks. The highway intersects with Township Road 413, which serves access to Hirsh Pond, located to the north. The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast. At an intersection with German Hill Road, the highway makes a shot to the east, passing through some woods. After the woods, the old alignment of PA 237 ends at an intersection with PA 434. This was once an intersection with PA 137.  History  PA 237 was assigned in 1928, during the mass numbering of state highways within Pennsylvania. The termini at the time were with PA 37 and PA 137, the former of which was the parent route. At the time, the entire highway was an unimproved gravel road. This lasted for four years, until 1932, when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the highway. The highway remained relatively unchanged until 1946, when the highway was decommissioned in a mass deletion of state highways within the commonwealth. The current alignment of former PA 237 is now Pike County SR 1012 from PA 590 to the Shohola Township border. The rest is locally maintained, with a piece at PA 434 designated Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454. The two state routes at the termini, PA 37 and PA 137, are now PA 434 and PA 590.

Hart served as the congregation's president and minister until at least 1893.Ginsberg (1969), p. 85. Services were held in members' homes for more than eight years. In 1884 the congregation acquired the Hoover School building at 200 Kalorama Street,Our History, Temple House of Israel website. at the corner of Market Street,American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 1, p. 267. and in February 1885 began holding services there. The building still stands, diagonally opposite the Stonewall Jackson Hotel. That same year the synagogue joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The congregation purchased land north of Staunton for a cemetery in 1886, and held its first burial there in 1887. The cemetery, on North Augusta Street between Woodland Drive and Lee Street, is still used for burials today.Staunton: Augusta County, International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies website. At the turn of the 20th century, House of Israel had no rabbi, but held services twice a week, Friday nights from 8:00 to 9:00pm, and Saturday from 10:30 to 11:30am. The congregation also ran a religious school.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 2, p. 482. By 1907 Staunton's Jewish population was an estimated 40 people. House of Israel had fifteen member families, and still held services twice a week. However, the congregation still had no rabbi, and the religious school no longer functioned.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 9, p. 422.

Career Carvalho co-founded the band The Sheiks in 1965. He sang and played the drums. He also played an instrumental role, either as a founder or a guest, of many other important Portuguese bands of the 1960s, among them bands such as Fluido, Banda 4 and Thilo's Combo. The Sheiks was Portugals answer to the Beatles. During the 1960s Portugal was ruled by an authoritarian dictatorship. This band came as a result of the climate in Portugal and captured the national mood. The people wanted the brightness of the Beatles sound and the Sheiks provided. The band sang songs such as Summertime, Missing You and Tell Me Bird. Though the band eventually broke up and Carvalho moved into contemporary Fado, the Sheiks have regrouped and performed in recent years. As a solo performer, Carvalho participated in the Festival RTP da Can√ß√£o and Eurovision Song Contest in 1974 and 1977. It was his song, the Portuguese entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, \\"E Depois do Adeus\\", which was used as the passcode at the beginning of the coup which toppled Portugal's dictatorship (in what has become known as the Carnation Revolution), giving Carvalho a permanent place in his country's history. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Carvalho won many international performance awards in Bulgaria, Poland and Belgium and was a strong participant in other music festivals in Chile, Argentina and Spain. In 1985, Carvalho began professionally associating himself with Fado, deferring to Portugal's traditional music as globalization came to be seen as a threat to his homeland's cultural heritage; Desculpem qualquer coisinha was his first record following this shift, and (though controversial) remains his most commercially successful venture. Many of Carvalho's songs were written by Jos√© Nisa, Jos√© Calv√°rio and Ary dos Santos as well as a poem by Alda Lara (\\"M√£e Negra\\"). He has worked with Fernando Tordo, Toz√© Brito, Carlos Mendes and Os Amigos and performed duets with Brito, Tordo and Dulce Pontes, among others. Several greatest hits albums have been released. Some of his best known songs are: * \\"E Depois do Adeus\\" (1974 Eurovision Song Contest) * \\"Flor sem Tempo\\" * \\"Lisboa Menina e Mo√ßa\\" * \\"M√£e Negra\\" * \\"Os Meninos do Huambo\\" * \\"Maria Vida Fria\\" * \\"Nini\\" * \\"Ol√° como est√°s?\\" (duet with Toz√© Brito) * \\"Pomba Branca\\" (duet with Dulce Pontes) * \\"Domingo na praia\\" Personal life Carvalho has been married three times. His first marriage to Teresa Maria Lobato de Faria Sacchetti produced one child, singer Mafalda Sachetti. His second marriage to Helena Isabel produced one child, Bernardo, also a singer known as Agir. His last marriage with Fernanda Borges produced one child Paulo Nuno. He is currently in a partnership with artist Susana Lemos with whom he has two girls. Style Carvalho can be described as a new fadisto, singing a contemporary fado, as opposed to the fado of Amalia Rodrigues, whose songs were rooted in an older tradition. Carvalho's style fuses contemporary Portuguese pop with some traditional elements of fado. In many cases, his songs mix other Iberian or pan-European traditions, the song \\"Minh Alma\\" for example is more flamenco-pop than fado. This trend is visible throughout his career in fado. Carvalho takes from the wider world of ballads and adds elements of jazz, pop, or whatever else he sees fit into his songs, yet still maintains the result as fado. Awards Carvalho was awarded with medal of Ordem da Liberdade by An√≠bal Cavaco Silva, President of Portugal, on 10 June 2009.

The show featured a panel of student commentators including Matt Cavedon of Harvard University, Thomas Dec of Yale University (formerly of The University of Connecticut-Stamford), Robert Burack of the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint, Bob Bowen of The University of Michigan, and Abigail Walls of Albion College. The show is best known for its involvement in the July 2008 Sonny Landham scandal. History The Weekly Filibuster was founded by Ben Goodman and Tom Dec and launched with special panelist Matt Cavedon on January 12, 2008. Cavedon immediately joined the program as a permanent panelist to represent the political right against the liberal Dec. The show first gained attention when presidential candidate Alan Keyes announced on the January 26, 2008 program that he was considering leaving the Republican Party. As the Democratic National Committee's struggle with Michigan and Florida's delegates garnered significant media in March, Robert Burack and Bob Bowen of Michigan, and Rebekah Hammond of Florida joined the broadcast to comment on the scandal, and would become permanent panelists. Hammond would leave the show in early summer 2008, but return as a guest panelist during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The show additionally aired on Wednesday nights during summer 2008 and 2009 as \\"The Weekly Filibuster: Wednesday Edition\\" and, alternatively, \\"The Wednesday Filibuster.\\" Abigail Walls served as a conservative panelist during August 2008, and returned a year later to be named as a permanent contributor to the panel. The show earned national attention in summer 2008 for its series of interviews with the Kentucky Libertarian Party nominee for United States Senate, Sonny Landham. The show was also featured on Politico.com's KoteckiTV (and subsequently, MSNBC) for hosting a debate between MSNBC-TV's David Shuster and Politico's James Kotecki. The show was among the first in the media to speculate that Sen. John McCain might pick Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate. The show aired coverage from the floor of the 2008 Democratic National Convention and has featured interviews with many guests including Katrina vanden Heuvel, Chris Cillizza, Gov. Paul Cellucci, Jack Cafferty, Gov. Pete du Pont, Autistic Self Advocacy Network President Ari Ne'eman, James Kotecki, Gov. Jane Swift, David Shuster, Kerry Healey, John Frary, Rabbi Dennis Shulman, Matthew Yglesias, Cyrus Krohn, Rick Noreiga, Joe Lauria, Former Senator Bob Smith, Thurston Clarke, Alan Keyes, Wayne Root, and Rick Davis. Sonny Landham, Mike Gravel, Brian Moore, and Gene Amondson all appeared on the program on multiple occasions. The show last aired on January 3, 2010. Sonny Landham saga Sonny Landham first appeared on The Weekly Filibuster on July 23, 2008 to address controversial comments in the Louisville Courier-Journal, referring to Arabs as \\"camel-dung shovelers.\\" Landham said on the show that he would stop Arabs from entering the United States. Landham was at the time the Libertarian Party nominee for a United States Senate from Kentucky held by Mitch McConnell. Following media coverage in newspapers and on WLEX, Landham returned to the program on July 25 and July 28 to further address his comments. Landham was stripped of his nomination due to the publicity surrounding the remarks and his failure to disavow them. Guest hosts and panelists On several occasions, Tom Dec and Matt Cavedon guest moderated the program, though Burack typically substituted when Ben Goodman was unavailable. While Robert Burack, Tom Dec, Bob Bowen, and Matt Cavedon appeared regularly, several panelists joined the show for extended stints, including Republican Sage Koontz at The University of Virginia, Jay Gobeil of the University of Maryland, College Park. Several guest panelists have made repeated appearances including Jonathan Padilla at Harvard University and Sam Free at The George Washington University. Ian Engdahl of Rhodes College made one guest appearance and would go on to serve a stint as the show's main announcer and semi-regular newsreader. Bostonian Peter Christopher of the University of Maine was a frequent substitute and guest panelist. He co-hosted Drive Time, a popular morning show on the University of Maine's WMEB with Goodman during the school year.

Description Upper part of figure of Saint Peter The retable measures 959 x 3330 mm (approximately 3 feet by 11 feet) and is painted on several joined oak panels using thin glazes of colour in linseed oil on a gessoed ground. The construction is complex, with six main flat panels, and several other wooden elements. The retable is divided into five sections by gilded wooden arcading,\\"Westminster Retable\\", Westminster Abbey: From 1065 to Today.

For example the Pala d'Oro in Venice (compared by Tudor-Craig, 102), or the Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne. The composition has a central section with three tall narrow openings defined by tracery containing full-length figures of Christ holding a globe as Salvator Mundi, flanked by the Virgin Mary holding a palm, and St John the Evangelist. To the sides are two sections each with four small medallions containing depictions of the Miracles of Christ, those to the right missing completely and those to the left showing the raising of Jairus‚Äô daughter, the healing of the blind man, the feeding of the 5,000 and another subject, too defaced to identify. The outermost sections contained single figures, to the left St Peter, dedicatee of the Abbey and the best preserved single figure, with the figure to the right now missing completely; according to George Vertue this was St. Paul., Tudor-Craig, 103. These sidemost panels were evidently added when most of the retable had been completed, and are of German rather than local Thames Valley oak, and the grain runs vertically, rather than horizontally as on the four panels making up the central three sections. The back of the retable, which would have been invisible, is painted as imitation porphyry. Much of the retable is lost beyond recovery. The painting is of very high quality, probably by an artist used to working on illuminated manuscripts, to judge by the fine detail of the work, and some stylistic details. In its position on the high altar the detailed images would only have been clearly visible to officiating clergy, and no concessions were made to more popular taste.\\"The Westminster Retable\\", published in Magazine Antiques, by Miriam Kramer, November 2005.

The tiny globe held by Christ is painted with four registers of scenes showing animals, trees, and a man in a boat.Tudor-Craig, 102-3 History After the Dissolution of the monasteries at the English Reformation, the retable panel was made into the lid of a chest, with the main painted side facing down. The chest was used to store wax funeral effigies of English monarchs, and the painting was not rediscovered until 1725, when it was drawn by Vertue (British Library). In 1778 serious damage was caused when the chest was modified into a cupboard or display case to show the funeral effigy of Pitt the Elder.Bunny Smedley, website of The Social Affairs Unit, with a fuller description.

Six years later there was a swing to the Liberals and they regained the Bethnal Green seat. In 1907 the local Conservative association chose a different candidate to contest the constituency at the next general election, with Ridley being rejected due to his views on tariff reform.

The more concentrated solution will have a tendency to diffuse into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each ion will be roughly proportional to its speed in an electric field, or their ion mobility. If the anions diffuse more rapidly than the cations, they will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution, leaving the latter negatively charged and the concentrated solution positively charged. This will result in an electrical double layer of positive and negative charges at the junction of the two solutions. Thus at the point of junction, a potential difference will develop because of the ionic transfer. This potential is called liquid junction potential or diffusion potential which is non-equilibrium potential. The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions' movement. Calculation The liquid junction potential cannot be measured directly but calculated. The electromotive force (EMF) of a concentration cell with transference includes the liquid junction potential. The EMF of a concentration cell without transport is: :E_\\\\mathrm{nt} = \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln \\\\frac{a_2}{a_1} where a_1 and a_2 are activities of HCl in the two solutions, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature and F is the Faraday constant. The EMF of a concentration cell with transport (including the ion transport number) is: :E_\\\\mathrm{wt} = t_M\\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln \\\\frac{a_2}{a_1} where a_2 and a_1 are activities of HCl solutions of right and left hand electrodes, respectively, and t_M is the transport number of Cl‚àí. Liquid junction potential is the difference between the two EMFs of the two concentration cells, with and without ionic transport: :E_\\\\mathrm{lj} = E_\\\\mathrm{wt} - E_\\\\mathrm{nt} = (t_M - 1)\\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln \\\\frac{a_2}{a_1} Elimination The liquid junction potential interferes with the exact measurement of the electromotive force of a chemical cell, so its effect should be minimized as much as possible for accurate measurement. The most common method of eliminating the liquid junction potential is to place a salt bridge consisting of a saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) with lithium acetate (CH3COOLi) between the two solutions constituting the junction. When such a bridge is used, the ions in the bridge are present in large excess at the junction and they carry almost the whole of the current across the boundary. The efficiency of KCl/NH4NO3 is connected with the fact that in these salts, the transport numbers of anions and cations are the same.

Signs and Symptoms  Patient will present with a slow growing, deep-seated, firm mass, often presenting bilaterally. There may be pain or tenderness, but this is rare. Cause There are several theories about origin: * There is support for a genetic predisposition, as there are alterations of short arm of chromosome 1; * Multifocality may suggest systemic enzymatic defect, resulting in abnormal elastogenesis; * Repeated trauma or friction seems unlikely, but is still a possibility.  Diagnosis  By computed tomography, there is a poorly circumscribed, heterogeneous soft tissue mass, with a signal intensity similar to skeletal muscle. The fact that the lesion may be bilateral, helps eliminate a sarcoma from further consideration. At US, elastofibromas are depicted deep to the musculature as a multilayered pattern of hypoechoic linear areas of fat deposition intermixed with echogenic fibroelastic tissue.Ochsner JE, Sewall SA, Brooks GN, Agni R.

Isolated recurrences may be seen, but there is no malignant potential.  Epidemiology  This is a very rare phenomenon (< 0.001% of soft tissue tumors), usually presenting in elderly patients (>50 years of age), and more commonly in women than men (5:1). There is an increased frequency in Okinawa, Japan, but this may be a reporting bias.

It was written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Adi Granov. Extremis elevates the status quo for Iron Man, increasing the power of his armor significantly. Extremis received mostly positive reviews, and is often listed as one of the best Iron Man stories.Ultimate Bookshelf 2.0: Iron Man, IGN Elements of Extremis were adapted for the 2008 film Iron Man, and the Iron Man: Armored Adventures episode \\"Extremis,\\" and the storyline serves as the primary source material for the 2013 film Iron Man 3. Production Extremis was the second story arc after the \\"Avengers Disassembled\\" crossover event, not to be confused with \\"Stark: Disassembled\\", a later story in The Invincible Iron Man. The story was meant as a sort of \\"new start\\" for the character‚Äîto redefine him from his origins as an arms dealer, to be the \\"test pilot for the future\\" Ellis intended him to be. The story rarely mentions any of Iron Man's past, and references to the rest of the Marvel universe are limited to brief, passing mentions of the Avengers and Fin Fang Foom. Warren Ellis admitted he had intentionally not read any Iron Man material besides the very earliest issues. This is similar for Adi Granov: \\"My first official introduction to the character occurred a year prior to Extremis. [...] Upon reading the script, I realized how realistic Warren's approach was to the story. [...] When illustrating the book I wanted my art to mirror the realism in Warren's writing [...] I felt that Warren wrote a story that's a sort of techno- thriller action story and I wanted the art to reflect this. [...] I saw Iron Man as not just a superhero in a suit; rather he is a pilot or weapon. To me, the Iron Man armor is more akin to a jet fighter than it is to an outfit.Iron Man: Extremis Director's Cut #1, Marvel Comics The story, which lasts about three to four days in comic book time, takes place at an undefined time after the founding of the New Avengers and before the Stamford catastrophe (which led to the Marvel Civil War). Story Tony Stark is a weapons designer whose weapons are being used against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the years just prior to the second Gulf War. He is injured during an inspection tour when one of his own bombs detonates, sending a piece of shrapnel into his chest, and is captured by Afghan terrorists. As in the original origin story, Tony creates his first suit of armor with Ho Yinsen and escapes the terrorists, with Yinsen killed during the escape (noted by Tony to be due to a single stray bullet). Three men enter a disused slaughterhouse in Texas, where two of them inject a willing third, whom they call \\"Mallen\\". This injection contains an experimental drug which makes him fall to the floor in immense pain. A bizarre physical change overtakes him; his horrified compatriots flee the room, but lock him in it. Miles underground in his Coney Island \\"garage\\", Stark is awakened from sleep and several weeks of work, isolation, and diminished self care by his secretary's phone call, reminding him of a scheduled interview with a journalist. During the interview, the journalist discovers that Stark is most regretful that the world-changing, humanitarian improvements he had hoped to fund with his weapons sales have not yet materialized. Confronted by his regrets, Stark returns to the garage, takes stock of himself while realizing that the Iron Man is likely his key to a better future for both himself and humanity. Having canceled all appointments, Tony Stark dons the newest version of the Iron Man armor and takes off into the sky. Meanwhile, the injected man's body, still lying in the Bastrop warehouse, is now covered completely in a bizarre layer of scar tissue. Later, at Futurepharm Corporation offices in Austin, Texas, Dr. Aldrich Killian commits suicide after typing and printing his confession. The note informs co-worker Maya Hansen that he has stolen and \\"loosed\\" the company's dangerous Extremis serum for some \\"greater\\" purpose. Hansen calls Tony Stark, whom she met years ago at a meeting of the minds. Back in the Texas slaughterhouse, the two men return to find Mallen almost completely recovered in appearance. He is alive, having almost punched through the locked metal door. Stark arrives in Texas in the middle of a teleconference with his board of directors, rejecting their requests that he resign as CEO of his company and take a head technician title instead. Tony also argues that Stark Industries, having invented a revolutionary cell phone and connection method, no longer needs the government's funding. The conference ends at a crossroad. Arriving at Futurepharm, Stark learns that the intended receiver of the Extremis dose is currently unknown due to an inability to hack Killian's computer. Using Stark Industry's new prototype phone, Tony emails Killian's entire hard drive to be hacked by one of his employees, and, to distract Maya, jets her and himself to San Diego to talk with their old friend and teacher, Sal Kennedy. Meanwhile, the three men from the slaughterhouse arrive at the FBI field office. While Kennedy, now a futurist following nature and an idealistic way of life, harangues Tony and Maya on their military work and thus-far-failed promise, Mallen sets the FBI office on fire using his new biological powers. Maya catches the story on the news, realizing that the terrorists are in fact using Extremis and causing casualties of over 50 civilians. Back in the van, Mallen tells his confederates that he is only getting started. In flight back to Texas, Maya tells Stark Extremis is a military nanotechnology serum that was another attempt to recreate the Captain America Super-Soldier Serum, and that the new formula interfaces with the brain's 'repair center' and directs the body to rebuild itself from scratch as if it were all wound tissue to be replaced. Stark receives a call from his employee, which reveals that Killian gave Extremis to local terrorists. Realizing the threat, Tony drops Maya off at Futurepharm, and departs. Iron Man tracks the terrorists' van from above via body heat scans and tears it in half with a non-lethal repulsor ray. Mallen instantly recovers, and after refusing to surrender peacefully, engages Iron Man in a brutal fight. Throughout the battle, it becomes obvious that Mallen's new abilities far surpass the processing speed and durability of Iron Man's armor. Suffering severe injuries and damage to his armor, Iron Man and the police manage to repulse Mallen, though civilian casualties are present. Mallen flees, leaving Stark trapped beneath a burning car with his armor at zero power. Stark saves himself and the car's passengers by raising his armor to 1% power by drawing from the flames' thermal energy, though he is forced to rely on the police to remove the car from atop his body. Iron Man calls Maya and has her people fly him to Futurepharm, where, in a private medical bay, he reveals himself as Tony Stark to Maya. Knowing the severity of his injuries, Tony realizes the only way for him to survive and defeat Mallen is to become one with the Iron Man by taking the Extremis serum himself. Maya gives Tony a lower dose of the serum that will not alter his mind and body as it did for Mallen. Unknown to Maya, Tony had altered the structure of the Extremis dose, removing several safeties and linking himself to his armor and machinery. Tony falls into a coma as a cocoon forms around his body. While unconscious, Stark relives his story as Iron Man, starting with his first mortal injury and the secrets he revealed to Yinsen while they constructed the original Arc Reactor (used to still the shrapnel lodged in Stark's chest and prevent it from puncturing his heart) and Iron Man suit (something powered by the same thing keeping him alive that would allow for the two of them to escape their captors). Tony confesses that the terrorists could not be allowed to use his weapons, and that his Military contracts were nothing more than \\"stealing money from the government\\" to fund something that would better all of mankind and bring a better future; the Iron Man idea was never a weapon of war, but the start of a process that would merge men with machines and make humanity great. Twenty-four hours into his coma, the cocoon which has covered his body bursts; Stark awakens, healed and newly fit. An internal control sheath for his Iron Man armor is now contained within the hollows of his bones, able to emerge upon mental command. He can integrate himself not only into his armor, but phone, computer, and even satellite networks. Maya confronts Tony on the potential strain his organs will suffer, only to find that the Extremis formula allowed him to grow entirely new organs. Using an older version of the Iron Man suit stored in a suit case, Tony explains that the autonomous armor was the way of the future, though its low processing speed made it useless until now. Tapping into a satellite cluster, Iron Man finds Mallen heading towards Washington, intent on killing the president. Having the police evacuate the city, Iron Man confronts Mallen. During the fight, Iron Man reveals several aspects of his past, saying that he was forced to kill nearly 50 people in order to escape the terrorists and save himself and his friend, only to witness a stray bullet kill Yinsen on impact. Mallen replies that his parents died the same way. Tony points out that when Mallen killed 50 people, he did so with no knowledge of who or what they were, and did so twenty years after the fact. Now superior to Mallen, Iron Man explains that he had to be the one to stop the terrorist, seeing Mallen as a perversion of himself: a man with power but no concern for or ability to see the future. In the end, Mallen refuses to listen, pins Stark to the ground, and violently declares, \\"There isn't any future. I'm gonna kill it!\\" Seeing the horror before him, Stark fires his unibeam, piercing Mallen's chest and tearing his organs apart. Enraged by the man's refusal to give up, as well as his contempt for all life, Iron Man grabs Mallen's head with both hands and blows it off with a double blast of his repulsor rays. Attempting to recover, Mallen's body rises onto its knees, only to collapse lifeless on the ground. Furious, Iron Man condemns Mallen for what he made him do. Recovering from the incident, Stark declares that he has one last thing to do: the worst part yet. Confronting Maya at Futurepharm, Iron Man reveals that Maya was clearly Killian's accomplice, due to the issue of needing two key cards entered at the same time as well as her extensive involvement with the formula. Maya allows herself to be taken away, though she justifies her actions by comparing the Extremis serum to the Atom Bomb, saying, \\"It had to be used once in anger so that it would never be used in anger again.\\" Maya then declares that Tony is no better than she is, to which Iron Man replies, \\"No. But I'm trying to be... And tomorrow I'll be able to look myself in the mirror.\\" The Extremis virus Extremis is referred to as a \\"virus\\" throughout the story. The verbatim description offered by its inventor Maya Hansen, goes: \\"...Extremis is a super-soldier solution. It's a bio-electronics package, fitted into a few billion graphite nanotubes and suspended in a carrier fluid. A magic bullet, like the original super-soldier serum‚Äîall fitted into a single injection. It hacks the body's repair center‚Äîthe part of the brain that keeps a complete blue print of the human body. When we're injured, we refer to that area of the brain to heal properly. Extremis rewrites the repair center. In the first stage, the body essentially becomes an open wound. The normal human blueprint is being replaced with the Extremis blueprint. The brain is being told the body is wrong. Extremis protocol dictates that the subject be placed on life support and intravenously fed nutrients at this point. For the next two or three days, the patient remains unconscious within a cocoon of scabs. (...) Extremis uses the nutrients and body mass to grow new organs. Better ones...\\"Iron Man vol.4 #3. Marvel Comics. Effects of the Extremis process, apart from the changes specific to Tony Stark, included: greatly accelerated healing; immensely- boosted immune system; generation of \\"new, improved organs\\" (Tony's cardiovascular and respiratory systems were greatly upgraded); and, the side effect of increased aggressiveness.Iron Man vol.4 #9. Marvel Comics Tony Stark had the super-powers removed from the Extremis compiler, though, effectively 'exchanging' them for the ability to interface directly with machines and his own armor; but, Mallen retained said super-powers, resulting in his high-level super-strength, super-speed, advanced invulnerability, and the abilities to breathe fire and project arcs of electricity from his hands, as well as being bullet-proof. As well as the obvious physical changes, Extremis also affected Stark mentally, allowing him to process information extraordinarily quickly, on a subconscious level, to help him better cope with the direct technological link he now possessed to his armor (even as his standard thought processes remained at a human norm). As a result, his brain, taking in more information than he could consciously process, began to sublimate it into his unconscious mind, causing Stark to experience occasional hallucinations of particularly relevant information, manifesting as people whose deaths he felt personally responsible for‚Äîsuch as Captain America or Happy Hogan‚Äîmaking him aware of facts that he had noted subconsciously while not recognizing their relevance or existence on a conscious level (such as that a member of the Initiative had lied about his powers or that Maya Hansen was actually alive after her death was faked). Doc Samson speculated that the hallucinations appeared because the excess information was filtered into the same place Stark subconsciously stored his guilt to stop himself facing it.Iron Man vol.4 #25. Marvel Comics When the Mandarin attempts to release Extremis on a large scale as part of his plan to 'reshape' the human race, it is revealed that Extremis can only be successful when used on people who possess a rare genetic sequence, found in only 2.5% of the human population. This percentage includes Tony Stark and Maya Hansen, but does not include the Mandarin. Anyone without this sequence who is exposed to Extremis will be killed by it.Iron Man vol.4 #24. Marvel Comics When industrialist Michael Hall attempts to create his own suits of armor based on the Carnage symbiote, Iron Man attempts to hack the suits, but Carnage is able to 'hack' Iron Man in return by using the technological/biological interface elements of Extremis.Carnage #5. Marvel Comics =Legacy= During the 2010 \\"Stark: Disassembled\\" storyline, Tony is forced to erase portions of his memory in order to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining access to the list of people registered under the Superhuman Registration Act. These actions resulted in his falling into a persistent vegetative state, in which his brain is unable to even regulate the autonomic functions of his body. During this period, Stark's colleagues play a recorded holographic message from Tony, which reveal that when the extraterrestrial Skrulls invaded Earth during the 2008 \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, they attacked Tony's Extremis, permanently shutting it down.Matt Fraction (w), Salvador Larocca (a). \\"Stark: Disassembled Part 2: Digging in the Dirt\\" The Invincible Iron Man #21 (February 2010), Marvel Comics Stark's mind is \\"rebooted\\" using information that he had saved when he first injected himself with Extremis, with the result that he loses all memory of the actions he had committed after receiving the Extremis upgrade, although he has spent time researching his activities between then and his restoration.

Marvel Comics Even after the two recognize that Tony's actions actually saved Bruce's life, Bruce modifies Extremis to modify his usual transformation, creating a new Hulk persona known as \\"Doc Green\\" (a form of Hulk that is similar to Bruce Banner's Merged Hulk form) who retains Bruce's intellect and the Hulk's strength.Hulk vol. 3 #5 (August 2014) After Doc Green attacked and depowered other gamma mutants as he believed that they were a threat, the Hulk then asked Shadowcat for help to remove the physical components of the Extremis virus from his brain, eliminating a tumour that may have killed him but furthering Doc Green's development into what appears to be a contemporary incarnation of the Maestro.Hulk vol. 3 #9 (December 2014) However, Doc Green eventually realised that his current state was only temporary and he would eventually return to normal, but an A.I. he created to facilitate his efforts at finding a cure has begun to work against him by using more Maestro-esque tactics,Hulk vol. 3 #12 with Doc Green declining the option of a new Extremis upgrade for fear of becoming a new Maestro.Hulk vol. 3 #16 During the 2014 \\"AXIS\\" storyline, Tony Stark experienced a moral inversion due to the Scarlet Witch making a mistake while trying to bring out Professor X in the new Red Onslaught, he experienced a new surge of his more negative traits such as his ego, irresponsibility, and alcoholism, culminating in him releasing a new version of Extremis onto San Francisco. This new version, known as the Extremis 3.0 app, could offer beauty, health or even immortality for free, but Tony subsequently ended the free trial mode and started charging the app in a daily fee basis, making the citizens desperate, prompting Pepper Potts, Daredevil, and an artificial intelligence based on Tony's mind stored in an old Iron Man armor to make plans to stop him, based on Tony's past requests that his allies be prepared if he should ever cross a line.Superior Iron Man #1 During the fight between Daredevil and Iron Man, Extremis is used by Iron Man to \\"infect\\" Daredevil with it which enabled him to see again.Superior Iron Man #2 Daredevil subsequently realized that Stark had added the Extremis virus to San Francisco's water supply, with the phones simply transmitting a subsonic signal that activated the already-existing virus in their bodies, but Stark subjected Matt to minor brain damage to erase his memories of this discovery, intending to reprogram the activation signal to a frequency Daredevil cannot detect.Superior Iron Man #4 This plan was ended when Pepper Potts exposed Tony's true feelings about the world after his inversion.Superior Iron Man #9 Following the eight months ellipsis after 2015 \\"Secret Wars\\", Tony Stark has returned to his normal self with no signs of his moral inversion personality.Invincible Iron Man vol. 2 #1 The status of the Extremis virus remains unknown. Reception Extremis received favorable reviews, and is often listed as one of the best Iron Man stories. In other mediaTelevision= * The Extremis mini-series was loosely adapted as an Iron Man: Armored Adventures episode of the same name. In the episode, the Extremis formula is retconned as an attempt to recreate the super-soldier serum that granted Captain America his powers. Mallen, an ex-agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than a terrorist, injects himself with the formula after being fired by Nick Fury, and badly injures Iron Man during their initial encounter. In response, Tony injects himself with a modified version of the Extremis formula, allowing him to fully interface with his armor, along with all other forms of technology, and defeat Mallen. According to Andros Stark in the episode \\"Iron Man 2099\\", everyone has an upgraded version of Extremis by 2099 while he is running version 16.5, named J.A.R.V.I.S. * The Extremis serum appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., continuing plot threads from Iron Man 3. The pilot episode introduces Michael Peterson (J. August Richards), a former factory worker who was injected by Hydra branch, Project Centipede, with an experimental serum created from the Extremis combined with Chitauri metal, gamma radiation, and an attempted recreation of Captain America's super-soldier serum. In \\"The Girl in the Flower Dress\\", Project Centipede attempts to improve the serum by experimenting on pyrokinetic street performer Chan Ho Yi; during which they harvest his blood platelets to stabilize Extremis' unstable elements. With this success, Centipede operative Raina (portrayed Ruth Negga) reports back to her superior, the \\"Clairvoyant\\". In \\"T.A.H.I.T.I.\\" and \\"Ragtag\\", Phil Coulson's team discover S.H.I.E.L.D. turncoat John Garrett is the Clairvoyant as well as his and Project Centipede's connections to Hydra after learning Centipede's research was meant for restoring his failing cybernetic implants. Raina combines the Centipede serum with the Kree-based GH-325 serum to stabilize Garrett, thought it comes at the cost of his sanity. =Film= * Iron Man's armor and origin as depicted in the 2008 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man closely resemble those introduced in Extremis. Based on his work on the story arc, artist Adi Granov was brought on as a producer for the film, who went on to create the final designs for Iron Man's armor.Forging Iron: Adi Granov talks Iron Man , Newsarama, September 11, 2007 \\"Extremis and Beyond\\" is included as a special feature on the DVD release. In other featurettes, Adi Granov and Warren Ellis are interviewed on the origin, the suits, John Pillinger (the interviewer), and the suit being on a crate, not a briefcase. * The Extremis storyline serves as the primary source material for the 2013 film Iron Man 3, with characters Maya Hanson and Aldrich Killian being adapted and characters like Mallen being merged with others, such as Eric Savin. Although the exact nature of Extremis is subtly changed, the key powers of enhanced strength and fire generation remain, although the enhanced soldiers are not as enhanced as in the comics, as Stark is able to fight them with remote- controlled armors rather than being required to give himself Extremis to face them on an equal footing. =Video games= * Iron Man wears the Extremis suit in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, as well as the follow-up, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. * The Extremis Suit appears as an optional suit in the Wii and DS versions of the Iron Man 2 video game. * Extremis soldiers are featured in Iron Man 3: The Official Game. * Extremis appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance, as part of Special Operations 9, which involves Iron Man, Rescue, and Iron Patriot fighting off Extremis-enhanced super-soldiers invading Avengers Tower while trying to investigate the source of the project. * Extremis soldiers appear in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.\\"76006 Iron Man: Extremis Sea Port Battle\\" .

The Cruz Laureada de San Fernando (Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand) is the highest military decoration awarded by the Spanish government. It is bestowed on a member of the Spanish armed forces who distinguishes himself during combat. It is Spain's equivalent to the American Medal of Honor.Valeriano Weyler Papers Early years Arenas Gaspar was born in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, when the island was still a Spanish colony. His father F√©lix Arenas Gaspar, Sr. was a captain of an artillery division stationed in the island. His family moved to Spain when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States as an outcome of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which concluded the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. They settled in the town of Molina de Arag√≥n, where his family originally came from, and there he received his primary and secondary education.Pando Despierto, Juan (1999). Historia secreta de Annual. Madrid: Ediciones Temas de Hoy. Colecci√≥n: Historia, 424 p. . (Spanish) Military career In 1906, Arenas Gaspar entered the Military Academy of Engineers of Guadalajara, Spain and earned his degree and lieutenant of engineer's commission in the Spanish Army in 1911. He was assigned to Aerostation Service and in 1913 earned his Balloon Pilot Badge. In October 1913, he was assigned to the Aerostation Company of Tetuan and served in North Africa where he was involved in active combat. From 1914 to 1917 he attended the Superior School of War, during which time (1915) he was promoted to the rank of Captain of Engineers. In 1919, Arenas Gaspar was given the command of the 2nd Company of Zapadores in Melilla. Melilla is a city under Spanish rule located on the Mediterranean, on the Moroccan coast. =Rif War= Cruz Laureada de San Fernando In 1919, a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule took place in Spanish Morocco, a Spanish protectorate in what is known as the Rif War.1911 - 1927 Rif War / Second Moroccan War In July 1921, many Spanish military outposts fell to the Riffian rebels, as part of the disaster of Annual, and Arenas Gaspar together with a lieutenant colonel by the name of Ugarte headed towards the town and fort of Dar Dr√≠us. During their journey they encountered members of a Spanish squadron retreating from Dar Dr√≠us, who informed them that the passageway was blocked. Arenas Gaspar joined the squadron, which included many of their wounded, and headed towards Monte Arruit. After helping with the wounded, Arenas Gaspar decided to go to Tistutin to defend the Spanish position there, and to re-establish the telegraph service with Monte Arruit which had been interrupted. Arena Gaspar's position was under constant enemy attack. He decided on the nights of July 25 and 26, to leave his parameter and set fire to the stacks of hay which served as the enemy's protective barriers. A member of his company by the name of Captain Aguirre and a squad of riflemen provided Arena Gaspar with the necessary firepower to cover him. He was severely burned when one the gasoline tanks which he was carrying blew up, but not before he killed ten of the enemy. On July 29, the Spanish troops were ordered to retreat to the major fort at Monte Arruit. Arenas Gaspar volunteered to stay in the rear to cover the retreat with Capt. Aguirre and 200 men. They fought against the enemy until the Spanish troops were safely in Monte Arruit. Then they found themselves surrounded and outnumbered by the Riffians. They battled against the Riffians until Arenas Gaspar ordered Capt. Aguirre and the survivors to reach the Spanish position at Monte Arruit. Arenas Gaspar decided to stay and cover their retreat. Arenas Gaspar took charge of one of the artillery batteries and opened fire, which halted the enemy advance and allowed his men to reach Monte Arruit. Unfortunately one of the Riffians was able to get close enough to Arenas Gaspar, shot him in the head, and killed him. Cruz Laureada de San Fernando Various officers who witnessed the actions of Arenas Gaspar requested that he be posthumously awarded the Cruz Laureada de San Fernando. In 1924, Capt. F√©lix Arenas Gaspar was awarded the Cruz Laureada de San Fernando (Laureate Cross of Saint Fernand), the highest military decoration awarded by the Spanish government. Legacy On July 5, 1928, King Alfonso XIII of Spain unveiled a bust with the likeness of Capt. F√©lix Arena Gaspar and named a street n his honor in the town of Molina de Aragon.

Prisoner of War Grasso had played only one season in the minor leagues when he enlisted in the United States Army in January 1942,Cort Vitty, Mickey Grasso. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project six weeks after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. He rose to the rank of technical sergeant and was assigned to the 34th Infantry Division when he was taken prisoner in Tunisia in February 1943 during the North African Campaign. Grasso was eventually interned in a POW camp in F√ºrstenberg (Oder), southeast of Berlin. In the waning days of the war, in April 1945, as he was being marched westward by his captors, Grasso was one of ten allied prisoners who escaped German custody and the invading Soviet Red Army and was rescued by American troops. Baseball career Although he had lost during his internment, Grasso was able to return to professional baseball in 1946 when he played 106 games at the Triple-A level before his recall by the New York Giants in September. He got into seven games, six as the Giants' starting catcher, but he had only three hits and was sent back to the minors for three full years. Selected by the Washington Senators in the 1949 Rule 5 draft, Grasso then spent the next five seasons in the major leagues. He hit a career-high .287 in and was the Senators' regular catcher in , when they posted their last winning season in Washington before moving in 1961 to Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. After four seasons in Washington, Grasso was traded to the contending Cleveland Indians in January 1954, but a broken ankle sustained during spring training sidelined him until September 2. The 1954 Indians won 111 games and captured their third American League pennant. Grasso was able to play in the 1954 World Series (against his old team, the Giants).

During the off-season, Grasso was reacquired by the Giants, and finished his big-league tenure with them in limited service during the season's early weeks. His 216 career MLB hits included 23 doubles, one triple and five home runs, and he was credited with 87 runs batted in. He was one of eight former World War II Prisoners of War to appear in the major leagues. His 13-season professional career ended in 1958.

Starting at school, in away matches he made 120 not out for Clifton against Sherborne in 1874 and a faultless 164 against Cheltenham in 1875.He also played for Gloucestershire, making his debut in 1875, just after leaving school. Going up to Oxford, he played in the University XI for four seasons from 1876 to 1889, with a best score of 71 against Middlesex. He was a double Blue and competed in the Varsity Match in rugby and in the University Match at cricket . In 1877 he played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Surrey at Lord's and in 1878 for Middlesex, appearing against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane and against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. He was a member of MCC. Three brothers-in-law, his brother, his father-in-law and his son all played club and county cricket. Heath himself made 44 appearances at first-class level in all, scoring 969 runs and taking 26 wickets. From 1879 on, his loyalty was to his native Staffordshire. He played for the county until 1898, being captain from 1884 to 1893 and leading the county team in its first ever Minor Counties Championship match. In addition, he served as honorary secretary from 1886 to 1888, and for many years as honorary treasurer. His highest scores for the county were 217 against Lincolnshire at Stoke-on-Trent in 1889, made in four hours, and 155 not out against Cheshire in 1882. Military career He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Staffordshire Yeomanry on 18 August 1880. He was promoted lieutenant on an unknown date, and captain on 16 October 1886. He was promoted honorary major on 9 September 1896, honorary lieutenant-colonel on 12 July 1905, substantive lt-col, and commanding officer, on 7 April 1906, and honorary colonel on 31 May 1906. He was awarded the Territorial Decoration on 2 April 1909. He retired on 6 April 1910. In the First World War he was lt-col with the 48th Midlands (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, until 1915. Business career He was involved in founding the Staffordshire Post in 1892, but this did not last long, with its parent company, The Staffordshire Potteries Newspaper Company, Ltd, wound up in 1896. The title was bought out by the Staffordshire Sentinel and Heath subsequently served as a director of that company, and later chairman, until the title was sold in 1928. Heath had joined the family business after graduation. On the death of his father in 1893, Heath and his two brothers formed the company of Robert Heath and Sons, Ltd to run the family's coal and iron interests. This was sold to the Low Moor Iron Company in 1910. The brothers had also founded the Birchenwood Colliery Company at Newchapel near Kidsgrove in 1893, developing a coking and coal byproducts business. This was the largest industrial site that the Newchapel area has ever known and provided employment for several thousand people in its heyday. According to his obituary in The Times Birchenwood did well during the First World War when its chemical products were in demand for explosives, but in the depression that followed, the company began to struggle, but the brothers kept it going to provide employment to the people of Kidsgrove, though it returned no profit to them. Political career Heath was elected as the 1900 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Hanley in Staffordshire, having fought the seat unsuccessfully in 1892 and 1895. After losing his seat at the 1906 general election, he was returned to the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election for the Leek division of Staffordshire, with a majority of only 10 votes.Craig, op. cit., page 387 He did not stand again at the December 1910 general election.

Kenya has competed in the Cricket World Cup since 1996. They upset some of the World's best teams and reached semi- finals of the 2003 tournament. They also won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20. Their most successful player is Steve Tikolo.Who helped them reach the semi finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup Cricket has always been played only at club level in cities like Nairobi, Kisumu, Nakuru and central province. But there never was a competition where these cities played each other until the Zonal League was started. History The History of Kenya Cricket http://cricketkenya.co.ke/history.php =Historical background= Following initial colonisation by the Portuguese, Kenya gradually came under British influence in the latter part of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century. Cricket was probably introduced to the country in the 1880s. =Early developments= The first match of note was \\"East African Protectorate v Rest of the World\\" at Mombasa in December 1899. From 1910, a series of games called Officials v Settlers was established and ran until 1964. In 1914, a Kenyan team crossed the border into Uganda and defeated their hosts by 5 wickets at Entebbe. Governing body Additional Article: Cricket Kenya is the official ICC recognised organisation chosen to represent Kenya in terms of cricket issues. Kenya broke away from the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference in 1981 and joined the ICC in their own right as an Associate member. Cricket Kenya are also Associate members of the African Cricket Association. Domestic competitions The National cricket competition in Kenya is also known as Zonal League. It is a four team cricket competition created by Cricket Kenya featuring a Twenty20 tournament, a one day cricket tournament and finally a three-day cricket tournament. For the inaugural league four teams will be competing consisting of the 60 best players according to Cricket Kenya from Kenya. The first edition of the competition involved four franchises, namely The Northern Nomads, The Eastern Aces, The Southern Stars, and The Western Chiefs. The teams were captained by National team players, Steve Tikolo, Thomas Odoyo, Kennedy Obuya, and Peter Ongondo in 2008. The inaugural T20 Competition, played in February 2008, was won by the Eastern Aces, while the first 50 over competition was won by the Northern Nomads, However the three day format of the competition was postponed due to unfavourable weather and was played in June 2008. Further difficulties in availability of players, many of whom were in school, meant that the first season of the three-dayers had to be compressed to two days per match. The league was sponsored by South African Sahara Computers, African Cricket Association and others in 2008. Following a lack of interest from contracted players and insufficient funding, the league was not held in 2009 and 2010, and has been replaced in 2011 by two new competitions; the East African Cup (50 overs a side) and the East Africa Premier League (Twenty20) (see below)  Former Elite League Teams  *The Eastern Aces captained by Steve Tikolo *The Northern Nomads captained by Thomas Odoyo *The Western Chiefs captained by Peter Ongondo *The Southern Stars captained by Kennedy Otieno East African Cup and East Africa Premier League In 2011, as part of a radical shakeup of cricket in the country following poor performances by the national team at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and in response to a huge gap in standards between the national side and the country's existing leagues, Cricket Kenya launched two new franchise based competitions. Season 2011/12 saw the launch of the 50 over a side East African Cup, and the Twenty20 East Africa Premier League. In addition to teams from Kenya, two teams from neighbouring Uganda were also awarded franchises, to ensure further development of playing standards, and to create more rivalry with Kenyan-based sides. Four teams from Kenya will participate * Nairobi Buffaloes * Kongonis (based in Nairobi) * Rift Valley Rhinos from Nakuru * Coast Pekee in Mombasa and two teams from Uganda * Rwenzori Warriors * Nile Knights Teams are composed of international players, senior club players and age group cricketers aiming to make the national squads of both countries. The top two teams in each competition compete in live televised finals. Cricket Kenya has agreed a broadcast deal with Supersport who will televise a number of live matches throughout Africa as well as a regular highlights and magazine programme. Cricket grounds There are several cricket venues in Nairobi accredited with full ODI status. The Ruaraka Sports Club Ground played host to the 1994 ICC Trophy final. Aga Khan Sports Club Ground and Nairobi Club Ground have hosted One Day Internationals and the Nairobi Gymkhana Club hosted two matches during the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

The musical collective releases music through their self-run label, Fort Knox Recordings. Their music style mixes elements of funk, reggae, hip hop and electronica. History Fort Knox Five was formed in 2003 by four like-minded musicians as an outlet for a new style of funk-infused electronic music. The group chose their name \\"...because our studio has always been called Fort Knox. There are actually only four of us, but five sounds better than four‚Ä¶Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five, Jurassic 5, Jackson 5, MC5.\\" Members hail from various side projects and previous outfits; Steve Raskin originally part of Edsel and Raskal as well as ESL Music Recording Artists Liftoff and Thunderball, Rob Myers plays sitar and guitar with Thievery Corporation and International Velvet and also plays guitar in See-I, Jon Horvath recorded music with both DJ Dan and Raskal, and Sid Barcelona was also a part of ESL Music Recording Artists Liftoff and Thunderball. Fort Knox Five formed their own record label, Fort Knox Recordings to release their music, and the label is now distributed by Washington, DC based Dischord Records. In 2005, Fort Knox Five were selected to be the opening dj's on Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour throughout North America, playing numerous shows in a wide variety of venues alongside Gwen Stefani and The Black Eyed Peas. Fort Knox Five were also selected by Urb Magazine for their annual \\"Next 100\\" artists to watch. In 2007, Fort Knox Five were selected to remix two Bob Marley songs which were released on Roots, Rock, Remixed. Fort Knox Five were also selected as the resident DJs at the Eye Candy Sound Lounge at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. In 2008, Fort Knox Five released their debut studio album Radio Free DC which features all four members of Fort Knox Five on production as well as numerous guest vocalists and musicians. The album is a good representation of the Fort Knox Five sound as it moves from genre to genre, all with a focus on providing party music. In 2009, Fort Knox Five began the year with a tour of Australia. This was followed by Fort Knox Recordings hosting a special inaugural event called The Funk 4 Peace Ball which featured Afrika Bambaataa, Fort Knox Five, 2Tuff and Nappy Riddem. EA released its Skate 2 video game in January, which featured Fort Knox Five songs on the game soundtrack. Fort Knox Five also released Volume 1 of Radio Free DC Remixed in February 2009.

The measure appeared on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon, as did Measure 57 which dealt with similar issues, but in a different way.OregonLive.com: \\"Mannix's tough-on-crime measure will be on Oregon ballot\\", The Oregonian, April 11, 2008 Background In 1994, Measure 11, another initiative proposed by Kevin Mannix, was passed, which set mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes. It is responsible for 28% of today's prison population. Oregon uses the highest percentage of its state budget to lock up criminals and supervise parole of any state. Oregon has seen a growth in prison inmates from about 4,000 to more than 13,500. If Ballot Measure 61, or the competitive measure proposed by the legislature, is passed, Oregon's prison population and percentage of state budget will become more pronounced. At the same time, Oregon has seen a greater drop in violent crime than the rest of the country on average since Measure 11 passed. =Measure 61 versus Measure 57= In February 2008, some members of the Oregon State Legislature proposed a bill to put a legislatively referred ballot measure, Measure 57, on the November 2008 ballot that would compete with Measure 61, but which would have less stringent mandatory minimums in it.Crime measures will fight it out come fall The Oregonian, February 23, 2008 In response, Mannix said that this \\"stinks of political manipulation\\". His concern is with how the competing measure's ballot title is set. If the ballot title sounds tough-on-crime, voters‚Äîmany of whom will judge the measure simply based on its title‚Äîmight vote for it, even though (Mannix alleges) the competing legislative measure is \\"wimpy\\".Mannix says Ore. lawmakers stacking the deck against his measure The key difference between the competing measures lies in how they treat first-time offenders. Measure 61 requires mandatory jail time for some first-time offenders; the competing measure does not. Supporters of Measure 61 believe that the method of establishing the ballot title for Oregon ballot measures is unfair and gives the legislatively referred Measure 57 an undue advantage at the polls. For a citizen-initiated measure in Oregon, the ballot title is determined by the state's Attorney General. In the case of the measure that will compete with Measure 61, the claim has been made that the legislature plans to set the ballot title without going through those normal channels.,Developing hard, Democrats avoiding review process again! Ted Piccolo, February 16, 2008Salem Democrats to give Republicans the perfect issue Specific provisions Ballot Measure 61 enacted the following provisions: * Sets mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug and property crimes and for identity theft. * It establishes a new felony crime of motor vehicle theft. * A person sentenced under Measure 61 sentencing guidelines must serve his or her full sentence‚Äîthe sentence could not be reduced for any reason. * The sentences must be served in state prison facilities and work camps. * The state is to reimburse counties for the cost of pre-trial detention for persons sentenced under Measure 61. * Manufacturing or dealing heroin or ecstasy requires 36 months in prison. * Manufacturing or dealing meth or cocaine within 1000 feet of a school requires 36 months in prison. * Persons convicted of burglarizing a residence or identity theft must serve a 36-month sentence.Voters' Pamphlet includes Specific provisions of Measure 61 =Estimated fiscal impact= The state's Financial Estimate Committee prepares estimated fiscal impact statements for any ballot measures that will appear on the ballot. The estimate prepared by this committee for Measure 61 says: * Measure 61 would require additional state spending of between $8‚Äì$10 million in the first year. * In the second year, it would cost from $67‚Äì$88 million. * In the third year, the cost would be $122‚Äì$178 million. * In the fourth and subsequent years, the cost would rise to $164 million and on up.Voters' Pamphlet includes Estimated fiscal impact statement for Oregon Measure 61 The state's Criminal Justice Commission said that the Mannix measure will cost between $128‚Äì$200 million a year, whereas the competing measure, Measure 57, would cost between $65‚Äì70 million per year.Bill poses crime-fighting choice Edward Walsh, The Oregonian, February 13, 2008 Support The chief petitioners for Measure 61 were Kevin Mannix, Duane Fletchall and Steve Beck. Kevin Mannix said that Oregon's incarceration rate is below the national average and that the costs are high because of well-compensated corrections officers. \\"You get what you pay for\\", Mannix argued, adding that state prisons are among the most drug-free in the country. Oregon prison officials questioned the Pew Center's numbers, mentioned below, and also pointed out that the Department of Corrections funnels about 20 percent of its budget directly to counties for jails and parole. Loren Parks, the biggest political contributor in Oregon history, donated over $100,000 to the campaign for this measure.The Oregonian: \\"Loren Parks adds $100,000 to crime measures\\", September 4, 2008 OppositionArguments against Measure 61= Notable arguments in opposition to the measure included: * Prison budgets take away from other government programs. * \\"The point is getting tough on crime has gotten tough on taxpayers\\". * It is one-size-fits-all and doesn't take account of differing circumstances. =Donors opposing Measure 61= Defend Oregon, as a committee, fought seven different ballot measures, and supported two others. As a result, it is not possible to discern how much of its campaign money was going specifically to defeat Measure 59.

It was the first coup d'√©tat since the independence of Ivory Coast and led to the President Henri Konan B√©di√© being deposed.  Background  Ever since independence in 1960, Ivory Coast had been controlled by F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny. During the first decades of his rule, Ivory Coast enjoyed economic prosperity and was politically stable. However, the later years of his rule saw the downturn of the Ivorian economy and signs of political instability. Henri Konan B√©di√© succeeded as president after Houphou√´t-Boigny's death in 1993. The economic situation continued to worsen. B√©di√© was accused of corruption, political repression, and of stripping immigrants from neighboring countries of their political rights by promoting the concept of Ivoirit√©, which placed in doubt the nationality of many people of foreign origin and caused tension between people from the north and the south of Ivory Coast. Dissatisfaction kept growing.  The coup  A group of soldiers led by Tuo Fozi√© rebelled on 23 December 1999. Refusing to step down at the soldiers' demand, B√©di√© was overthrown by a coup d'√©tat the following day. Former army commander Robert Gu√©√Ø, although not having led the coup d'√©tat, was called out of retirement as head of a National Public Salvation Committee (). Scattered gunfire were heard around Abidjan. Gu√©√Ø announced the dissolution of parliament, the former government, the constitutional council and the supreme court. The rebels took control of Abidjan Airport and key bridges, set up checkpoints, and opened prison gates to release political prisoners and other inmates. Mobs took advantage of the power vacuum to hijack cars. Some parts of Abidjan were also looted by soldiers and civilians. On television, Gu√©√Ø announced that he had seized power. He also made a television address to the people and foreign diplomatic personnel, in which he gave assurances that democracy would be respected, international agreements would be maintained, the security of Ivorians and non-Ivorians would be guaranteed, missions to foreign countries would be sent to explain the reasons for the coup, and the problems of farmers would be addressed. Many Ivorians welcomed the coup, saying that they hoped the army would improve Ivory Coast's shaky economic and political circumstances. France, the United States and several African countries, however, condemned the coup and called for a return to civilian rule. Canada suspended all direct aid to Ivory Coast. There were indications within a few months of the coup that the country was sliding into a pattern of arbitrariness. The Ivorian Human Rights League () issued a condemnation of human rights abuses, charging the security forces, among other things, with summary executions of alleged criminals without investigation and of harassment of commercial entities. Many cases of abuse were committed by the soldiers. Also, soldiers demanded increases in pay or bonus payments, causing many mutinies. The most serious one of these mutinies took place on 4 July 2000. The mutineers targeted the cities of Abidjan, Bouake, Katiola, Korhogo, and Yamoussoukro in particular. After some days of confusion and tension, an agreement was reached between the discontented soldiers and the authorities. Under the agreement, each soldier would receive 1 million CFA francs (about $1,400). Following the mutiny of July 2000, four officials of the Rally of the Republicans () were also arrested during an investigation into a possible coup attempt. The RDR is the party of Alassane Dramane Ouattara, F√©lix Houphou√´t- Boigny's last Prime Minister and the political rival of the ousted former president Henri Konan B√©di√©. The four arrested officials, including Amadou Gon Coulibaly, the Deputy Secretary General of the RDR, were released without charge some days later. Despite the junta's denunciation of Ivoirit√©, the campaign against people of foreign origin continued. In April 2000, Robert Gu√©√Ø expelled the representatives of the RDR from the government. A new constitution, approved by referendum on 23 July 2000, controversially barred all presidential candidates other than those whose parents were Ivorian, and Ouattara was disqualified from the 2000 presidential election. The tension between people from the north and the south still remained unsolved, as many people in the north are of foreign origin. Discrimination toward people originating in neighbouring countries is one of the cause of the Ivorian Civil War, which broke out in 2002. A presidential election was held on 22 October 2000. All of the major opposition candidates except for Laurent Koudou Gbagbo of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) were barred from standing. Gu√©√Ø was defeated by Gbagbo but refused to recognize the result. Ouattara, excluded from this election, called for a new election. Street protests broke out, bringing Gbagbo to power, and Gu√©√Ø fled to Gouessesso, near the Liberian border. Laurent Gbagbo took office as president on 26 October 2000. On 13 November, Gu√©√Ø recognised the legitimacy of the presidency of Gbagbo. On 10 December 2000, parliamentary elections were held and won by Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front. However, the election was not held in northern Ivory Coast because of the unrest related to the election boycott by the DRD until the by- election on 14 January 2001.

It is based on the true story of the pursuit of American serial killer John Wayne Gacy.  Plot  As he investigates the missing person report of a teenager named Christopher Gant (based on Gacy's final victim, Robert Piest), Des Plaines, IL detective Lt. Joseph Kozenczak (Riley) becomes concerned that local businessman John Wayne Gacy (Dennehy) may be responsible for this as well as many other disappearances. However, when he and his team are ready to arrest Gacy, their evidence is viewed as being circumstantial. Worst of all, everyone (including Kozenczak's superiors) view Gacy as a respectable pillar of society. Meanwhile, Gacy himself begins a sadistic game of cat-and-mouse as he tries in every way to manipulate and outwit the police. After eventually achieving two search warrants, Kozenczak finds a large amount of incriminating evidence, and later 29 bodies buried throughout John Gacy's property; the remaining four are found dumped in a nearby river, including Gant's remains. Afterwards, he is charged with the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men and convicted, being sentenced to death.

In general, the film was received well by critics. As a result, Brian Dennehy was nominated for an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special.\\" In addition, actor Michael Riley and director Eric Till were both nominated for two individual Gemini Awards.  Historical context  The film broadly follows the historical narrative of the investigation which lead to John Wayne Gacy's arrest in December 1978 and it does not directly depict his earlier life or his criminal activity prior to 1978. Several changes were made to the names and details of the real persons who were involved in the case. These changes were possibly made for legal reasons, because many key witnesses and victims' family members, as well as Gacy himself, were still alive at the time of the film's production. In the film Gacy's last known victim Robert Piest was represented as 'Chris Gant.' In the film the name of Gacy's contracting company was changed from 'PDM Contractors' to 'LPW Construction.'

Situated at a strategic point between Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity,van Seters, John (1997), Abraham in History and Tradition (Yale University Press) the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. In ancient times, Palestine was intermittently controlled by several independent kingdoms and numerous great powers, including Ancient Egypt, Persia, Alexander the Great and his successors, the Roman Empire, several Muslim dynasties, and the Crusaders. In modern times, the area was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, then the United Kingdom. Since 1948, Palestine has been divided into Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Other terms for approximately the same geographic area include Canaan, Zion, the Land of Israel, Southern Syria, Outremer and the Holy Land. The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. During the Early and Middle Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, Syria, and ancient Egypt, which ruled the area in the Late Bronze Age (1550‚Äì1200 BCE). The following period saw the emergence of the Israelites, who‚Äîaccording to the disputed Biblical tradition‚Äîestablished the United Kingdom of Israel in 1020 BCE, which split between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The Neo-Assyrian Empire conquered the region c. 740 BCE, then the Neo- Babylonian Empire in c. 627 BCE. The latter destroyed the Temple of Jerusalem in 586 BCE and deported Jewish leaders to Babylonia. They were only allowed to return by the Achaemenid Emperor Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE. In the 330s BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenid Empire, including Palestine, which changed hands numerous times during the wars of his successors, until the Seleucid Empire gained its control between 219 and 200 BCE. In 116 BCE, the Jewish Hasmoneans took their independence from the Seleucids, but their kingdom progressively became a vassal of Rome, which finally annexed Palestine, and created the province of Judea in 6 BCE. Roman rule was nevertheless troubled by several Jewish revolts, to which Rome answered with the Sack of Jerusalem, the second destruction of the Temple. After the final Bar Kokhba revolt Hadrian joined the provinces of Judaea and Syria to form Syria Palaestina. Later, with the Christianization of the Roman Empire Palestine became a center of Christianity, attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The region of Palestine was conquered by the Rashidun caliphs following the 636 CE Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim conquest of Syria, and incorporated into the Bilad al-Sham province as the military districts of Urdunn and Filastin. In 661 CE, Muawiyah I founded the Umayyad Caliphate in Jerusalem. His successors notably built there the Dome of the Rock‚Äîthe world's first great work of Islamic architecture‚Äîand the al-Aqsa Mosque. The Abbasids replaced them in 750, but from 878 Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers: the Tulunids, then the Ikhshidids. The Fatimids conquered the region in 969, but lost it to the Great Seljuq Empire in 1073, and recaptured in 1098. However, the next year the Crusaders established the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Palestine, which lasted almost a century until its conquest in 1187 by Saladin, the founder of the Ayyubid Sultanate. Despite seven further Crusades, the Crusaders could not recover their power in the region. The Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate took Palestine from the Mongols (who had conquered the Ayyubid Sultanate) after the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. The Ottoman Turks captured Mamluk Palestine and Syria in 1516. Ottoman rule of the country lasted without interruption for three centuries, until its conquest by Muhammad Ali's Egypt in 1832. Eight years later, the United Kingdom intervened and returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans in return for extraterritorial rights for Europeans living in Palestine. Considerable demographic changes happened during the 19th century, and with the regional migrations of Druze, Circassians and Bedouin tribes. The emergence of Zionism also brought many Jewish immigrants from Europe, and the revival of the Hebrew language.Parfitt, Tudor (1987) \\"The Jews in Palestine, 1800‚Äì1882.\\" Royal Historical Society Studies in History (52). Woodbridge: Published for the Royal Historical Society by Boydell. During World War I the British government issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which favored the establishment of national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The British captured Jerusalem from the Ottomans a month later. The League of Nations formally awarded Britain a mandate over Palestine in 1922. Continuous Jewish immigration and British colonial rule led to sectarian violence between Jews and Arabs which eventually caused the British government to announce its intention to terminate the Mandate in 1947. The United Nations General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish states. However, the situation in Palestine had deteriorated into a civil war between Arabs and Jews. The former rejected the Partition Plan, the latter ostensibly accepted it, declaring the independence of the State of Israel in May 1948 upon the termination of the British mandate. Nearby Arab countries immediately attacked Israel, which not only prevailed but also conquered far more territory of the Mandate than envisioned by the Partition Plan. During the war, 700,000, or about 80% of all Palestinians fled or were driven out of the territory that Israel conquered, and were not allowed to return, in an event that became known as the Nakba (\\"Catastrophe\\") to the Palestinians. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing for decades thereafter, about 850,000 Jews from the Arab world immigrated (\\"made Aliyah\\") to Israel. After the war, only two regions of Palestine remained in Arab control: the West Bank (and East- Jerusalem), annexed by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt), which were conquered by Israel during the Six-Day War in 1967. Despite international objections, Israel started to establish settlements in these occupied territories. Meanwhile, the Palestinian national movement gradually gained international recognition, largely thanks to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO, founded in 1965) under the leadership of Yasser Arafat. In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PA) as an interim body to run parts of Gaza and the West Bank (but not East Jerusalem) pending a final solution to the conflict. Further peace developments were not ratified and/or implemented, and in recent history, relations between Israel and Palestinians have been marked by repeated military conflicts, especially with the Islamist group Hamas, which also rejects the PA. In 2007, Hamas won control of Gaza from the PA, now limited to the West Bank. In November 2012, the State of Palestine (the name used by the PA) was upgraded in the UN to non-member observer state status, a move that allows it to take part in General Assembly debates and improves its chances of joining other UN agencies. Prehistoric period The earliest human remains in Palestine were found in Ubeidiya, some 3 km south of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberias), in the Jordan Rift Valley. The remains are dated to the Pleistocene, c. 1.5 million years ago. These are traces of the earliest migration of Homo erectus out of Africa. The site yielded hand axes of the Acheulean type.Galilee, Sea of. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

These anatomically modern humans, both adult and infant, are now dated to about 90‚Äì100,000 years old, and many of the bones are stained with red ochre, which is conjectured to have been used in the burial process, a significant indicator of ritual behavior and thereby symbolic thought and intelligence. 71 pieces of unused red ochre also littered the site. Mount Carmel has yielded several important findings, among them Kebara Cave that was inhabited between 60,000‚Äì48,000 BP and where the most complete Neanderthal skeleton found to date. The Tabun cave was occupied intermittently during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic ages (500,000 to around 40,000 years ago). Excavations suggest that it features one of the longest sequences of human occupation in the Levant. In the nearby Es Skhul cave excavations revealed the first evidence of the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture, characterized by the presence of abundant microliths, human burials and ground stone tools. This also represents one area where Neanderthals‚Äîpresent in the region from 200,000 to 45,000 years ago‚Äîlived alongside modern humans dating to 100,000 years ago.Olson, S. _Mapping Human History._ Houghton Mifflin, New York (2003). p. 74‚Äì75. In the caves of Shuqba in Ramallah and Wadi Khareitun in Bethlehem, stone, wood and animal bone tools were found and attributed to the Natufian culture (c. 12,800‚Äì10,300 BCE).

Archaeological finds from the early Canaanite era have been found at Tel Megiddo, Jericho, Tel al-Far'a, Bisan, and Ai (Deir Dibwan/Ramallah District), Tel an Nasbe (al-Bireh) and Jib (Jerusalem). The Canaanite city-states held trade and diplomatic relations with Egypt and Syria. Parts of the Canaanite urban civilization were destroyed around 2300 BCE, though there is no consensus as to why. Incursions by nomads from the east of the Jordan River who settled in the hills followed soon thereafter.Mills, 1990, p. 439. In the Middle Bronze Age (2200‚Äì1500 BCE), Canaan was influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria. Diverse commercial ties and an agriculturally based economy led to the development of new pottery forms, the cultivation of grapes, and the extensive use of bronze. Burial customs from this time seemed to be influenced by a belief in the afterlife. The Middle Kingdom Egyptian Execration Texts attest to Canaanite trade with Egypt during this period.Slavik, Diane. 2001. Cities through Time: Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Jerusalem.

Propp \\"Amarna Letters\\" The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. These refer to several local proxy rulers for Egypt such as Biridiya of Megiddo, Lib'ayu of Shechem and Abdi-Heba in Jerusalem. Abdi-Heba is a Hurrian name, and enough Hurrians lived in Palestine at that time to warrant contemporary Egyptian texts calling the people of Syro-Palestinians ·∏™urru.Benjamin J.

The extent of the Achaean/Mycenaean civilization is shown in purple. In the first year of his reign pharaoh Seti I (ca.1294‚Äì1290 BCE) waged a campaign to resubordinate Canaan to Egyptian rule, thrusting north as far as Beit Shean, and installing local vassals to administer the area in his name. A burial site yielding a scarab bearing his name, found within a Canaanite coffin excavated in the Jezreel Valley, attests to Egypt's presence in the area.Ilan Ben Zion, ' Egyptian coffin, gold seal with king‚Äôs name found in Israel,' The Times of Israel, 9 April 2014. Excavations have established that the late 13th, the 12th and the early 11th centuries BCE witnessed the foundation of perhaps hundreds of insignificant, unprotected village settlements, many in the mountains of Palestine. From around the 11th century BCE, there was a reduction in the number of villages, though this was counterbalanced by the rise of certain settlements to the status of fortified townships. In 1178 BCE, the Battle of Djahy (Canaan) between Ramesses III and the Sea Peoples marked the beginning of the decline in power of the New Kingdom in the Levant during the wider Bronze Age collapse. Iron Age: Canaanites, Israelites and Philistines During the beginning of the Iron Age (c. 1175 BCE), the Philistines occupied the southern coast of Canaan, and mingled with the local population, losing their separate identity over several generations.Shahin (2005), p. 6Carl S. Ehrlich \\"Philistines\\" The Oxford Guide to People and Places of the Bible. Ed. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online.

Since then the traditional territories of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh have been covered by intensive surveys. These surveys have revealed the sudden emergence of a new culture contrasting with the Philistine and Canaanite societies existing in Palestine during Iron Age I.Finkelstein and Silberman, Free Press, New York, 2001, 385 pp., , p 107 This new culture is characterised by the lack of pork remains (whereas pork formed 20% of the Philistine diet in places), an abandonment of the Philistines/Canaanite custom of having highly decorated pottery, and the practice of circumcision. According to Prof. Faust Avraham of Bar-Ilan University, the Israelite ethnic identity had been created, not from the Exodus and a subsequent conquest, but from a transformation of the existing Canaanite-Philistine cultures.Avraham Faust (2009) \\"How Did Israel Become a People?

King James version. Ezra, Chapter 9 Hebrew, a dialect of Canaanite became the language of the hill country and later the valleys and plains. The first use of grapheme-based writing originated in the area, probably among Canaanite peoples resident in Egypt. All modern alphabets are descended from this writing. Written evidence of the use of Classical Hebrew exists from about 1000 BCE. It was written using the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. According to the Hebrew Bible, the United Kingdom of Israel was established by the Israelite tribes with Saul as its first king in 1020 BCE. In 1000 BCE, Jerusalem was made the capital of King David's kingdom and it is believed that the First Temple was constructed in this period by King Solomon. By 930 BCE, the united kingdom split to form the northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria), and the southern Kingdom of Judah. These kingdoms coexisted with several more kingdoms in the greater Palestine area, including Philistine town states on the Southwestern Mediterranean coast, Edom, to the South of Judah, and Moab and Ammon to the east of the river Jordan.Bienkowski, op.cit. The socio-political system during this period was characterized by local patrons fighting other local patrons, lasting until around the mid-9th century BCE when some local chieftains were able to create large political structures that exceeded the boundaries of those present in the Late Bronze Age Levant. Archaeological evidence from this era is believed to corroborate some biblical events. In 925 BCE, Pharaoh Sheshonk I of the Third Intermediate Period is recorded to have invaded Canaan following the Battle of Bitter Lakes, and is thought to be the same as Shishak, the first Pharaoh mentioned in the Bible who captured and pillaged Jerusalem. There was an at least partial Egyptian withdrawal from Palestine in this period, though it is likely that Bet Shean was an Egyptian garrison as late as the beginning of the 10th century BCE. The Kurkh Monolith, dated c. 835 BCE, describes King Shalmaneser III of Assyria's Battle of Qarqar, where he fought alongside the contingents of several kings, among them King Ahab and King Gindibu. The Mesha Stele, from c. 850 BCE, recounts the conquering of Moab, located East of the Dead Sea, by king Omri, and the successful revolt of Moabian king Mesha against Omri's son, presumably King Ahab (and French scholar Andr√© Lemaire reported that line 31 of the Stele bears the phrase \\"the house of David\\" (in Biblical Archaeology Review [May/June 1994], pp. 30‚Äì37).). Inscriptions at Tel Dan and Tell es-Safi record parts of the conquest of the region by Hazael of Aram Damascus in the 830s BCE. The Levant c. 830 BCE Developments in Palestine during this period have been the focus of debate between those who accept the version in the Hebrew Bible of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes, and those who reject it. Niels Peter Lemche, of the Copenhagen School of Biblical Studies, submits that the biblical picture of ancient Israel \\"is contrary to any image of ancient Palestinian society that can be established on the basis of ancient sources from Palestine or referring to Palestine and that there is no way this image in the Bible can be reconciled with the historical past of the region\\". For example, according to Jon Schiller and Hermann Austel, among others, while in the past, the Bible story was seen as historical truth, \\"a growing number of archaeological scholars, particularly those of the minimalist school, are now insisting that Kings David and Solomon are 'no more real than King Arthur,' citing the lack of archaeological evidence attesting to the existence of the United Kingdom of Israel, and the unreliability of biblical texts, due to their being composed in a much later period.\\"Austel in Grisanti and Howard, 2003, p. 160.Schiller, 2009, p. 98. Sites and artifacts, including the Large Stone Structure, Mount Ebal, the Merneptah, and Mesha stelae, among others, are subject to widely varying historical interpretations: the \\"conservative camp\\" reconstructs the history of Israel according to the biblical text and views archaeological evidence in that context, while scholars in the minimalist or deconstructionist school hold that there is no archaeological evidence supporting the idea of a United Monarchy and the biblical account is a religious mythology created by Judean scribes in the Persian and Hellenistic periods; a third camp of centrist scholars acknowledges the value of some isolated elements of the Pentateuch and of Deuteronomonistic accounts as potentially valid history of monarchic times that can be in accord with the archaeological evidence, but argue that nevertheless the biblical narrative should be understood as highly ideological and adapted to the needs of the community at the time of its compilation.Finkelstein, Mazar and Schmidt, 2007, pp. 10‚Äì20Matthew Sturgis, It ain't necessarily so, Carol A.

The Bible records the Israelite cities becoming vassals to the Neo-Assyrian Empire during this period. At around this time, the Siege of Gezer (c. 733 BCE), west of Jerusalem, is recorded on a stone relief at the Assyrian royal palace in Nimrud. Further military expeditions into the region are recorded in the annals of Sargon and Sennacherib, as well as in the bible. According to the bible, between 722 and 720 BCE the northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrian Empire and the Israelite tribes‚Äîthereafter known as the Lost Tribes‚Äîwere exiled. The most important finding from the southern Kingdom of Judah is the Siloam Inscription, dated c. 700 BCE, which celebrates the successful encounter of diggers, digging from both sides of the Jerusalem wall to create the Siloam tunnel and water pool, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in .Pritchard, Texts p. 321Pritchard, Pictures p. 275, 744J.

The region was controlled briefly by Pharaoh Necho II of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt between the Battle of Megiddo (609 BCE) and the Battle of Carchemish four years later, and further conflict between the Babylonians and the 26th dynasty of Egypt is recorded during 601‚Äì586 BCE. According to the bible, this culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem and the First Temple were destroyed by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II.

This included, according to Herodotus and Arrian, the regions of Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine and Cyprus, divided into three administrative areas: Phoenicia, Judah and Samaria, and the Arabian tribes. The Phoenician cities of Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and Aradus were vassal states ruled by hereditary local kings who struck their own silver coins and whose power was limited by the Persian satrap and local popular assemblies. The economies of these cities were mainly based on maritime trade. During military operations, the Phoenicians were obliged to put their fleet at the disposal of the Persian kings. Judah and Samaria enjoyed considerable internal autonomy. Bullae and seal impressions of the end of the 6th and beginning of the 5th centuries mention the province of Judah. Its governors included Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel under Cyrus and Darius I; Nehemiah; Bagohi, who succeeded Nehemiah and whose ethnicity is difficult to determine; and \\"Yehizkiyah the governor\\" and \\"Yohanan the priest\\", known from coins struck in Judah in the 4th century BCE. From the second half of the 5th century the province of Samaria was governed by Sanballat and his descendants.*Dandamaev, M (1994): \\"\\", in E. Yarshater (ed.)

Sebastia, near Nablus, was the northernmost province of the Persian administration in Palestine, and its southern borders were drawn at Hebron.Palestine. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved August 12, 2007, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Some of the local population served as soldiers and lay people in the Persian administration, while others continued to agriculture. In 400 BCE, the Nabataeans made inroads into southern Palestine and built a separate civilization in the Negev that lasted until 160 BCE. The end of the Persian period was marked by a number of revolts in the region, including a significant uprising against Artaxerxes III in 350 BCE, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem. Classical antiquityHellenistic period= The Seleucid Empire in c. 200 BCE Hasmonean Kingdom at its greatest extent under Salome Alexandra In the late 330s BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region, during his six-year Macedonian conquest of the empire of Darius III of Persia. Alexander's armies took Palestine without complication while traveling to Egypt after the Siege of Tyre, beginning an important period of Hellenistic influence in the land.Shahin (2005), p. 7 During 323‚Äì301 BCE, the region changed hands numerous times during the wars of the Diadochi, with rulers including Laomedon of Mytilene, Ptolemy I Soter and Antigonus I Monophthalmus. In 312 BCE Ptolemy I Soter defeated Antigonus' son Demetrius I at the Battle of Gaza, but withdrew from the region shortly thereafter. It is probable that Seleucus I Nicator, then an admiral under Ptolemy's command, took part in the battle, as following the battle he was given 800 infantry and 200 cavalry and immediately travelled to Babylon where he founded the Seleucid Empire. The region was finally re-captured by Ptolemy I Soter after Antigonus I Monophthalmus was killed at the Battle of Ipsus. Ptolemy had not taken part in the battle, and the victors Seleucus I Nicator and Lysimachus had carved up the Antigonid Empire between them, with Southern Syria intended to become part of the Seleucid Empire. Although Seleucus did not attempt to conquer the area he was due, Ptolemy's pre-emptive move led to the Syrian Wars, which began in 274 BCE between the successors of the two leaders. The northern portion of Palestine ultimately fell into the hands of the Seleucid Empire in 219 through the betrayal of Governor Theodotus of Aetolia, who had held the province on behalf of Ptolemy IV Philopator. The Seleucids advanced on Egypt, but were defeated at the Battle of Raphia (Rafah) in 217. However, in 200 BCE Southern Palestine also fell under the control of the Seleucid Empire following the Battle of Panium (part of the Fifth Syrian War) in which Antiochus III the Great defeated the Ptolemies., p. 225. The landscape during this period was markedly changed by extensive growth and development that included urban planning and the establishment of well-built fortified cities. Hellenistic pottery was produced that absorbed Philistine traditions. Trade and commerce flourished, particularly in the most Hellenized areas, such as Ashkelon, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Gaza, and ancient Nablus (Tell Balatah). The Persians had not interfered with the internal affairs of the various subject-peoples of the region, but the Greeks followed a policy of deliberate Hellenisation, encouraging, although not normally enforcing, Greek culture. Hellenisation took root first in the densely settled coastal and lowland areas, and only really began to impinge on more backward areas such as Judea in the early 2nd century. According to Josephus and the Books of the Maccabees, the continued Hellenization of Palestine by the Seleucids resulted in an uprising in the Judean Mountains, known as the Maccabean Revolt. Although the revolt was quelled in 160 BCE at the Battle of Elasa, the Seleucid Empire entered a period of rapid decline in 145‚Äì144 BCE, beginning with the overthrowing of King Alexander Balas at the Battle of Antioch (145 BCE) (the capital of the empire) by Demetrius II Nicator in alliance with Ptolemy VI Philometor of Egypt, as well as the capturing of Seleucia (the previous capital of the empire) by Mithradates I of Parthia. By 116 BCE, a civil war between Seleucid half-brothers Antiochus VIII Grypus and Antiochus IX Cyzicenus resulted in a breakup of the kingdom and the independence of certain principalities, including Judea. This allowed Judean leader John Hyrcanus to carry out the first military conquests of the independent Hasmonean kingdom in 110 BCE, raising a mercenary army to capture Madaba and Schechem, significantly increasing the regional influence of JerusalemSievers, 142 The Hasmoneans gradually extended their authority over much of the region, forcibly converting the populations of neighbouring regions, and creating a Judean- Samaritan-Idumaean-Ituraean-Galilean alliance in the process. The Judean (Jewish, see Ioudaioi) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as Judaea, a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the Judean Mountains. \\"In both the Idumaean and the Ituraean alliances, and in the annexation of Samaria, the Judaeans had taken the leading role. They retained it. The whole political‚Äìmilitary‚Äìreligious league that now united the hill country of Palestine from Dan to Beersheba, whatever it called itself, was directed by, and soon came to be called by others, ‚Äòthe Ioudaioi‚Äô\\" During 73‚Äì63 BCE, the Roman Republic extended its influence into the region in the Third Mithridatic War. During the war, Armenian King Tigranes the Great took control of Syria and prepared to invade Judea but retreated following an invasion of Armenia by Lucullus. According to Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi writing in c. 482 CE, Tigranes captured Jerusalem and deported Hyrcanus to Armenia; however, most scholars deem this account to be incorrect. =Roman Period= In 63 BCE, Roman general Pompey the Great conquered the Hasmonean kingdom, starting a centuries-long period of Roman rule in the region. Restoration of regional self-governance Pompey and his immediate successors, Aulus Gabinius, etc., reduced certain areas of the land into single city domains and petty lordships. \\"The Jews were ...obliged to give up all the possessions which they had hitherto gained, particularly the whole coast\\". These cities had been self-governing poleis before the Jewish Hasmoneans had conquered them in the 2nd century BCE. The Romans restored their self-governing status and as such this event was marked as the Pompeian era by some cities. \\"Under the early Roman Emperors the local communities lived under a variety of governments. The Greco-Macedonian colonies kept their own magistrates under whom were a senate and a popular assembly. The ancient Greek city-state remained the organization type. The Phoenician city-states likewise retained their traditional oligarchical systems, to which a Greek colouring had been by this time added\\". :Regions and cities awarded self-governance under Roman rule: Roman Judea Extent of the Roman Empire under Augustus, 30 BCE ‚Äì 6 CE Following the Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey in 63 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of legal and religious councils known as sanhedrin based at Jerusalem, Sepphoris (Galilee), Jericho, Amathus (Perea) and Gadara.: \\"And when he had ordained five councils (œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒ±), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee.\\"\\"Josephus uses œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒøŒΩ for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Palestine and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a sanhedrin was placed (\\"Ant.\\" xiv 5, ¬ß 4).\\" via Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanhedrin: Roman rule was solidified when Herod, whose dynasty was of Idumean ancestry, was appointed as king. Following a brief intervention by Pacorus I of Parthia, from 37 Judea under Herod I was a client kingdom of the Roman Empire. Among the most notable archaeological remnants from this era are Herodium (Tel al- Fureidis) to the south of Bethlehem, Masada and Caesarea Maritima.http://icarus.umkc.edu/sandbox/perseus/pecs/page.887.a.php Herod arranged a renovation of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount platform and major expansion of the Jewish Temple around 19 BCE. Around the time associated with the birth of Jesus, Roman Palestine was in a state of disarray and direct Roman rule was re- established. In 6 CE, the Herodian governorate ended with the deposition of Herod Archelaus as the ethnarch of the Tetrarchy of Judea. The Herodian Dynasty was then replaced by Roman prefects and after 44 CE by procurators, beginning with Coponius. Herodians continued to rule elsewhere in Palestine. Senator Quirinius was appointed Legate of the Roman province of Syria (to which Judea had been \\"added\\" according to Josephus \\"Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now added to the province of Syria\\" though Ben-Sasson claims it was a \\"satellite of Syria\\" and not \\"legally part of Syria\\"H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, pp. 247‚Äì248: \\"Consequently, the province of Judea may be regarded as a satellite of Syria, though, in view of the measure of independence left to its governor in domestic affairs, it would be wrong to say that in the Julio-Claudian era Judea was legally part of the province of Syria.\\") and carried out the tax census of both Syria and Judea known as the Census of Quirinius. Caesarea Palaestina replaced Jerusalem as the administrative capital of the region.A History of the Jewish People, H. H. Ben-Sasson editor, 1976, p. 247: \\"When Judea was converted into a Roman province [in 6 CE, p. 246], Jerusalem ceased to be the administrative capital of the country. The Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters to Caesarea. The centre of government was thus removed from Jerusalem, and the administration became increasingly based on inhabitants of the hellenistic cities (Sebaste, Caesarea and others).\\" Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean Jew, born around the beginning of the first century, and hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere. Using the gospel accounts with historical data, most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6 and 4 BCE for Jesus, but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range. For example, John P. Meier states that Jesus' birth year is c. 7/6 BC, while Finegan favors c. 3/2 BC. The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of John the Baptist and was crucified by Roman governor Pontius Pilate. Most scholars agree that his crucifixion was between 30 and 33 CE. As a result of the First Jewish-Roman War (66‚Äì73), Titus sacked Jerusalem (in 70 CE) destroying the Second Temple, leaving only supporting walls, including the Western Wall. Pharisee rabbi Yokhanan ben Zakai, a student of Hillel, fled during the siege of Jerusalem to negotiate with the Roman General Vespasian. Yokhanan obtained permission to reestablish a Sanhedrin in the coastal city of Iamnia (modern Yavne) (see also Council of Jamnia). He founded a school of Torah there that would eventually evolve, through the Mishna in around 200 CE, into Rabbinic Judaism. The region's leading Christians (Jewish Christians) relocated to Pella. Other Jewish groups such as Sadducees and Essenes are no longer recorded as groups in history. In 106 CE, the Nabatean territory was incorporated into the Roman province of Arabia Petraea.Mark A. Chancey (2005) Greco-Roman Culture and the Galilee of Jesus Cambridge University Press, p 62 Syria Palaestina The Roman empire at its peak under Hadrian showing the location of the Roman legions deployed in 125 CE In 132 CE, the Emperor Hadrian joined the province of Judea (comprising Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea) with Galilee to form new province of Syria Palaestina. Hadrian probably chose a name that revived the ancient name of Philistia (Palestine), combining it with that of the neighboring province of Syria, in an attempt to suppress Jewish connection to the land.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 334: \\"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.\\"Ariel Lewin. The archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine. Getty Publications, 2005 p. 33. \\"It seems clear that by choosing a seemingly neutral name ‚Äì one juxtaposing that of a neighboring province with the revived name of an ancient geographical entity (Palestine), already known from the writings of Herodotus ‚Äì Hadrian was intending to suppress any connection between the Jewish people and that land.\\" However, Cassius Dio, the Roman historian from whom we have the bulk of our understanding of the revolt, does not mention the change of name nor the reason behind it in his \\"Roman History\\". Roman History, Cassius Dio, book 69 parts 12‚Äì15 Jerusalem was renamed \\"Aelia Capitolina\\" and temples were built there to honor Roman gods, particularly Jupiter. In 135 CE, Hadrian's victory in the Bar Kokhba's revolt resulted in 580,000 Jews killed (according to Cassius Dio) and destabilization of the region's Jewish population. Jerusalem was re-established as the Roman military colony of Aelia Capitolina; a largely unsuccessful attempt was made to prevent Jews and Christians from living there. Many Jews and Christians left Palestine altogether for the Diaspora communities, and large numbers of prisoners of war were sold as slaves throughout the Empire. Christianity in particular was practiced in secret and the Hellenization of Palestine continued under Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211 CE). New pagan cities were founded in Judea at Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin), Diopolis (Lydd), and Nicopolis (Emmaus). Some two hundred Jewish communities remained, as gradually certain religious freedoms were restored, such as exemption from the imperial cult and internal self-administration. The Romans made no such concession to the Samaritans, to whom religious liberties were denied, while their sanctuary on Mount Gerizim was defiled by a pagan temple, as part of measures were taken to suppress the resurgence of Samaritan nationalism. A number of events with far-reaching consequences took place during this period, including further religious schisms between Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism such as a council held by the bishops of Palestine in Caesarea in 195 that decreed that Easter was to be always kept on a Sunday, and not with the Jewish Passover. The Romans destroyed the community of the Mother Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of JesusWhealey, J (2008) \\"Eusebius and the Jewish Authors: His Citation Technique in an Apologetic Context\\" (Journal of Theological Studies; Vol 59: 359‚Äì362) The line of Jewish bishops in Jerusalem, which is claimed to have started with Jesus's brother James the Righteous as its first bishop, ceased to exist, within the Empire. Hans Kung suggests that the Jewish Christians sought refuge in Arabia and he quotes with approval a view that this created a paradox of truly world-historical significance that while Jewish Christianity was swallowed up in the Christian church, it preserved itself in Islam.Hans K√ºng,Christianity and world religions: paths of dialogue with Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, Orbis Books, 1993 p.124. During 259‚Äì272, the region fell under the rule of Odaenathus as King of the Palmyrene Empire after the capture of Emperor Valerian by Shapur I at the Battle of Edessa caused the Roman Empire to splinter until Aurelian defeated the Palmyrenes at the Battle of Emesa (Homs). =Byzantine period= The Byzantine Empire in 476 Following the victory of Christian emperor Constantine in the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306‚Äì324), the total Christianization of the Roman Empire began.Shahin (2005), p. 8 Within a few months, the First Council of Nicaea (first worldwide Christian council) confirmed the status of Aelia (Jerusalem) as a patriarchate,Schaff's Seven Ecumenical Councils: First Nicaea: Canon VII: \\"Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of Aelia [i.e., Jerusalem] should be honored, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honor.\\"; \\"It is very hard to determine just what was the \\"precedence\\" granted to the Bishop of Aelia, nor is it clear which is the \\"metropolis\\" referred to in the last clause. Most writers, including Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it to be C√¶sarea; while Zonaras thinks Jerusalem to be intended, a view recently adopted and defended by Fuchs; others again suppose it is Antioch that is referred to.\\" at which point the city is generally taken to have been renamed Jerusalem. Theodosius I declared Christianity the state religion of the empire in 380, and Palestine became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (\\"Byzantium\\") after the division of the Roman Empire into east and west (a fitful process that was not finalized until 395 CE). Palaestina I (Philistia, Judea and Samaria) and Palaestina II (Galilee and Perea) The Byzantines redrew the borders of Palestine. The various Roman provinces (Syria Palaestina, Samaria, Galilee, and Peraea) were reorganized into three diocese of Palaestina, reverting to the name first used by Greek historian Herodotus in the mid-5th century BCE: Palaestina Prima, Secunda, and Tertia or Salutaris (First, Second, and Third Palestine), part of the Diocese of the East. Palaestina Prima consisted of Judea, Samaria, the Paralia, and Peraea with the governor residing in Caesarea. Palaestina Secunda consisted of the Galilee, the lower Jezreel Valley, the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former Decapolis with the seat of government at Scythopolis. Palaestina Tertia included the Negev, southern Jordan‚Äîonce part of Arabia‚Äîand most of Sinai with Petra as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris. According to historian H.H. Ben-Sasson,H.H. Ben- Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , p. 351 this reorganisation took place under Diocletian (284‚Äì305), although other scholars suggest this change occurred later in 390. This was the period of Palestine's greatest prosperity in antiquity. Urbanization increased, large new areas were put under cultivation, monasteries proliferated and synagogues were restored. The cities of Palestine, such as Caesarea Maritima, Jerusalem, Scythopolis, Neapolis, and Gaza reached their peak population, and the population West of the Jordan may have reached as many as one million. Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica, drew on Orosius' information gathered from the local Jews to describe Palestine as one of the provinces of \\"Syria, which is called Aram by the Hebrews. The place is between the River Euphrates and the Great Sea, and extends towards Egypt; its largest provinces are Commagene, Phoenicia, and Palestine, as well as the countries of the Saraceni and the Nabathaei. It has twelve gentes.\\"54Merrills, A. H., History and Geography in Late Antiquity, Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought fourth Series, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne, 2005, pp. 242‚Äì243 In 326, Constantine's mother Saint Helena visited Jerusalem and ordered the destruction of Hadrian's temple to Venus, which had been built on Calvary. Accompanied by Macarius of Jerusalem, the excavation reportedly discovered the True Cross, the Holy Tunic and the Holy Nails. The first Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, the first Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the first Church of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives were all built during Constantine's reign. The earliest monasteries in Christianity outside of Egypt were built in Palestine during this period, notably those of Hilarion near Gaza, Saint Epiphanius at Ad near the city of Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin, the head of the largest bishopric in Palestine at this time), Tyrannius Rufinus and Melania the Elder on the Mount of Olives, Euthymius the Great at Pharan, Sabbas the Sanctified in the Kidron Valley as well as St. George's Monastery in Wadi al- Qelt, the Monastery of the Temptation and Deir Hajla near Jericho, and Deir Mar Saba and Deir Theodosius east of Bethlehem. The sack of Rome in 410 caused a significant episode of migration to Palestine as a group of aristocratic ladies responded to the holy man Jerome's invitation to settle in Aelia Capitolina and Bethlehem. In 451, the Council of Chalcedon confirmed Jerusalem's status as a Patriarchate as one of the Pentarchy, and Juvenal of Jerusalem became the first Patriarch of JerusalemHorn, Cornelia B.; Robert R. Phenix, Jr. 2008. The Lives of Peter the Iberian, Theodosius of Jerusalem, and the Monk Romanus. Atlanta, Georgia: Society of Biblical Literature, p. lxxxviii. Notable works by Christian scholars were produced in Palestine in the disciplines of rhetoric, historiography, Eusebian ecclesiastical history, classicizing history and hagiography. Saint Cyril of Jerusalem delivered his Mystagogical Catecheses, instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practise, and Saint Jerome moved to Jerusalem in order to commence work on the Vulgate, commissioned by Pope Damasus I and instrumental in the fixation of the Biblical canon in the West. Procopius, from Caesarea Palaestina, became the Byzantine Empire's principal historian of the 6th century, writing the Wars of Justinian, the Buildings of Justinian and the celebrated Secret History. Palestine according to Eusebius and Jerome, by George Adam Smith, 1915 Under Byzantine rule, the two dioceses of Palaestina proper became a center of Christianity, while retaining significant Jewish and Samaritan communities. Some areas, like Gaza, were well known as pagan holdouts, and remained attached to the worship of Dagon and other deities as their ancestors had been for thousands of years.Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar (1999) Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World Harvard University Press, p 553 Ghassanid Arab migration in the 4th and 5th centuries established an Arab Christian domain with a capital on the Golan, forming a buffer of Christian Byzantium against the wild tribes of Arabia. The \\"Life of Barsauma of Samosata\\", a 6th-century Christian polemic about the Monophysite monk of the early 5th century, stated that Jews, Samaritans and pagans formed a large part of the population and persecuted Christians during this period.Moshe Gil and Ethel Broido (1997) History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099, Translated by Ethel Broido Cambridge University Press, p 3Jews and Christians in the Holy Land, Gunter Stemberger, 2000 In 351‚Äì352, a Jewish revolt against Byzantine rule in Tiberias and other parts of the Galilee was brutally suppressed. In 361, Neoplatonist Julian the Apostate becomes Roman Emperor and attempted to reverse the growing influence of Christianity by encouraging other religions. As a result, Alypius of Antioch was commissioned to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and Jews were formally allowed to return to the cityBrowning, Robert. 1978. The Emperor Julian. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, p. 176. However, two years later the Galilee earthquake of 363 together with the re-establishment of Christianity's dominance following the death of Julian the Apostate at the Battle of Samarra ended the attempts to rebuild the Temple. In 438 CE, the Empress Eudocia allowed Jews to return to Jerusalem to live. The Samaritan self-rule had shortly gained a level of independence under the leadership of Baba Rabba in late 4th century. However, they were again subdued by Byzantine forces. Samaritan attempts to gain independence from Byzantines peaked during the 5th and 6th centuries in a series of Samaritan Revolts, some of which had messianic aspirations. The outcome of Samaritan strife with Christian Byzantines, supported by Ghassanid Arabs, turned disastrous. After the Third Samaritan revolt in 529‚Äì531, led by Julianus ben Sabar, and the Fourth Revolt in 555. With Samaritan casualties went well beyond 100,000, cities and worship places destroyed, many enslaved and expelled, the Samaritan community dwindled. On 1 July 536 CE, Justinian I promoted Stephanus (Stephen) the governor at Caesarea to proconsul (anthypatos), giving him authority over the two remaining consulars. Justinian believed that the elevation of the governor was appropriate because he was responsible for \\"the province in which our Lord Jesus Christ... appeared on earth\\".Kenneth G. Holum \\"Palestine\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. Ed. Alexander P. Kazhdan. Oxford University Press 1991.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 102‚Äì104 Justinian I undertook a number of building works in Jerusalem, including the once magnificent Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos (\\"the Nea\\") and the extension of the Cardo thoroughfare. This map of Palestine and the Holy Land was published in Florence around 1480 and was included in Francesco Berlinghieri's expanded edition of Ptolemy's Geographia (Geography). Byzantine administration of Palestine was temporarily suspended during the Persian occupation of 614‚Äì28. In 613 CE, the Persian Sassanian Empire under Khosrau II had invaded the Levant led by General Shahrbaraz, taking Antioch and later Caesaria. Jews under Benjamin of Tiberias assisted the conquering Persians, revolting against the Byzantine Empire under Heraclius and hoping of controlling Jerusalem autonomously. In 614 CE, Persian-Jewish forces conquered Jerusalem, destroying most of the churches, taking Patriarch Zacharias prisoner, taking the True Cross and other relics to Ctesiphon, and massacring much of the Christian population.Hussey, J. M. 1961. The Byzantine World. New York, New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, p. 25.Karen Armstrong. 1997. Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths. New York, New York: Ballantine Books, p. 229. The Jews of Jerusalem gained autonomy to some degree, but frustrated with its limitations and anticipating its loss offered to assist the Byzantines in return for amnesty for the revolt. In 617 CE, the Jewish governor Nehemiah ben Hushiel was killed by a mob of Christian citizens, three years after his appointment. The Sassanids quelled the uprising and appointed a Christian governor to replace him. At that time the Persians betrayed the agreements with the Jews and expelled the Jewish population from Jerusalem, forbidding them to live within of it. In 625 CE (or 628 CE), the Byzantinian army returned to the area, promising amnesty to Jews who had joined the Persians, and was greeted by Benjamin of Tiberias. In 629 CE, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius marched into Jerusalem at the head of his army, following the decisive defeat of the Sassanid Empire at the Battle of Nineveh (627). Heraclius personally returned the True Cross to the city.Ostrogorsky, George. 1969. History of the Byzantine State. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, p. 104. The Nabateans roamed the Negev by the Roman Period, and by the Byzantine Period dominated the swath of sparsely populated deserts, from the Sinai to the Negev to the northwest coast of Arabia, the outlands that the Byzantines called the diocese of Palaestina Salutoris (meaning something like \\"near Palestine\\"). Its capital Petra was formally the capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. The Nabateans also inhabited the outland of Jordan and southern Syria, improperly called the diocese of Arabia because its capital Bostra was within the northern extremity of the Roman province of Arabia Petrae. The origin of the Nabateans remains obscure, but they were Aramaic speakers, and the term \\"Nabatean\\" was the Arabic name for an Aramean of Syria and Iraq. By the 3rd century during the Late Roman Period, the Nabateans stopped writing in Aramaic and began writing in Greek, and by the Byzantine Period they converted to Christianity.Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews (London 1987) Trading relations existed between the cities of Palestine and the Arab tribes of the Hejaz, particularly with the southern cities of Petra and Gaza. Muhammed, his father (Abd Allah) and his great-grandfather (Hashim, who died in Gaza) all travelled on trading routes through the region in the 6th century,A History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099, Moshe Gil, pp. 16‚Äì17 and in 583 Muhammed is said to have met with Nestorian monk Bahira at Bosra. From the beginning of Islam in 610,See Muhammad's first revelation Jerusalem became the Qibla (focal point for Muslim prayers) for fourteen years until it was replaced by Mecca in 624, 18 months after the Hijra (Muhammad's migration to Medina). According to Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad then ordained the Al-Aqsa Mosque as one of the three holy mosques of Islam. A decade later, Byzantium lost control of the region during the Muslim conquest of the Levant, during which the empire's forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. Jerusalem capitulated in 638 and Caesarea between 640 and 642. The subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire. Middle AgesRashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid periods= The expansion of the caliphate under the Umayyads. An anachronistic map of the various de facto independent emirates after the Abbasids lost their military dominance (c. 950). In 638, following the Siege of Jerusalem, the Caliph Omar Ibn al-Khattab and Safforonius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, signed Al-Uhda al-'Omariyya (The Umariyya Covenant), an agreement that stipulated the rights and obligations of all non-Muslims in Palestine. Christians and Jews were considered People of the Book, enjoyed some protection (dhimmi) but had to pay a special poll tax called jizyah (\\"tribute\\") in return for this protection. According to Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, the covenant guaranteed Christians freedom of religion but prohibited Jews from living in Jerusalem. However, during the early years of Muslim control of the city, a small permanent Jewish population returned to Jerusalem after a 500-year absence.Gil, Moshe (February 1997). A History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099. Cambridge University Press. pp. 68‚Äì71. . Umar, the second of the initial four Rashidun Caliphs, was the first conqueror of Jerusalem to enter the city on foot, and when visiting the site that now houses the Haram al-Sharif, A popular account from later centuries is that the Rashidun Caliph Umar was led to the place reluctantly by the Christian patriarch Sophronius. He found it covered with rubbish, but the sacred Rock was found with the help of a converted Jew, Ka'b al-Ahbar. Al-Ahbar advised Umar to build a mosque to the north of the rock, so that worshippers would face both the rock and Mecca, but instead Umar chose to build it to the south of the rock. It became known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The first known eyewitness testimony is that of the pilgrim Arculf who visited about 670. According to Arculf's account as recorded by Adomn√°n, he saw a rectangular wooden house of prayer built over some ruins, large enough to hold 3,000 people. Cities that accepted the new rulers, as recorded in registrars from the time, were: Jerusalem, Nablus, Jenin, Acre, Tiberias, Bisan, Caesarea, Lajjun, Lydd, Jaffa, Imwas, Beit Jibrin, Gaza, Rafah, Hebron, Yubna, Haifa, Safed and Ashkelon.Shahin, 2005, p. 10. In Arabic, the area approximating the Byzantine Diocese of Palaestina I in the south (roughly Judea, Philistia, and southern Jordan) was called Jund Filastin (meaning \\"the military district of Palestine\\", as a tax administrative area),http://www.mideastweb.org/caliph2m.gif and the Diocese of Palaestina II in the north (roughly Samaria, Galilee, Golan, and northern Jordan) Jund al-Urdunn. In 661, with the assassination of Ali, the last of the Rashidun Caliphs, Muawiyah I became the uncontested Caliph of the Islamic World. Muawiyah I was ordained as Caliph in Jerusalem, ending the First Fitna and marking the beginning of the Umayyad Empire. Under Umayyad rule, the Byzantine province of Palaestina Prima became the administrative and military sub-province (jund) of Filastin‚Äîthe Arabic name for Palestine from that point forward. It formed one of five subdivisions of the larger province of ash-Sham (Arabic for Greater Syria). Jund Filastin (Arabic ÿ¨ŸÜÿØ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ, literally \\"the army of Palestine\\") was a region extending from the Sinai to the plain of Acre. Major towns included Rafah, Caesarea, Gaza, Jaffa, Nablus and Jericho. Lod served as the headquarters of the province of Filastin and the capital later moved to Ramla. Jund al-Urdunn (literally \\"the army of Jordan\\") was a region to the north and east of Filastin, which included the cities of Acre, Bisan and Tiberias. The Dome of the Rock In 687‚Äì691, during the Second Fitna, the Dome of the Rock was built under Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, becoming the world's first great work of Islamic architecture. The Temple Mount (known as Haram Ash-Sharif in the Islamic world and the site where the Islamic prophet Muhammad is believed by Muslims to have begun his nocturnal journey to heaven), had remained unbuilt for c. 600 years since Titus's destruction of Herod's Temple in 70. About a decade afterward, Caliph Al-Walid I had the Al- Aqsa Mosque built. It was under Umayyad rule that Christians and Jews were granted the official title of \\"Peoples of the Book\\" to underline the common monotheistic roots they shared with Islam.Ahl al-Kitab. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved August 12, 2007, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Christian pilgrims visited and made generous donations to Christian holy places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and the establishment of the Pilgrims' Inn in Jerusalem during this period was seen as a fulfillment of Umar's pledge to Bishop Sophronious to allow freedom of religion and access to Jerusalem for Christian pilgrims. The Christian monasteries throughout the region continued to operate, and between 730‚Äì749 John of Damascus, previously chief adviser to Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, moved to the monastery Mar Saba outside Jerusalem and became the major opponent of the First Iconoclasm through his theological writings. Trading relations between Palestine and Europe were strong, and a trade fair took place in Jerusalem every year on September 15 where merchants from Pisa, Genoa, Venice and Marseilles converged to acquire spices, soaps, silks, olive oil, sugar and glassware in exchange for European products. In 744 riots broke out in the major cities of Palestine and Syria during the reign of Marwan II, and were quelled in 745‚Äì6. These rebellions were followed by further revolts in the East of the empire, which culminated in the defeat of the Umayyad army in 750 at the Battle of the Zab. The Abbasids took control of the entire empire including Palestine, forcing Marwan II to flee via Gaza to Egypt, where he was assassinated. The Baghdad- based Abbasid Caliphs renovated and visited the holy shrines and sanctuaries in Jerusalem, with Al-Mansur arranging in 758 the renovation of the Dome of the Rock that had collapsed in an earthquakeGil, Moshe (February 1997). A History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099. Cambridge University Press. pp. 297‚Äì298. . and Al-Ma'mun arranging further renovations following a visit to Jerusalem in 813. The Abbasids continued to build up Ramle, which had become the capital of Jund Filastin. Coastal areas were fortified and developed and port cities like Acre, Haifa, Caesarea, Arsuf, Jaffa and Ashkelon received monies from the state treasury.Shahin (2005), p. 11 However, the Abbasid caliphs visited the region less frequently than the Umayyads since their capital in Baghdad was a further east. The Abbasid period marked the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age, in which a number of scholars from Palestine, such as the Gazan-born jurist and founder of the Shafi'i school of fiqh Muhammad ibn Idris ash- Shafi\`i and the Jerusalemite geographer Al-Muqaddasi, played an integral part. The influence of the Arabian tribes declined during the Abbasid period and the only context where they are reported is in uprising against the central authority.Gil, Moshe (February 1997). A History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099. Cambridge University Press. pp. 279‚Äì281. . However, a dispute between the Qaysi Mudhar and Yamani tribes broke out in Jund al-Urdunn towards the end of the 8th century leading to Qaysi-Yamani war of 793‚Äì96. Harun al-Rashid viewed this tribal dispute as a rebellion and sent a large army under Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki to quell the revolt. According to historian Moshe Gil, \\"he put down the rebels with an iron hand and much blood was spilled.\\" The cities of Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, Ascalon in Jund Filastin and the town Sariphaea in Jund al-Urdunn were completely destroyed in the conflict by Bedouin tribes. Several towns and villages in western Palestine were also sacked.Palestine Exploration Fund, 1872, p. 167. The monasteries of St. Chariton, St. Cyriacus, St. Sabas, St. Theodosius, and St. Euthymius were also attacked.Patrich, 2001, p. 65. The combined casualties of the tribal federations totalled roughly 1,200.Shagrir, Ellenblum, Riley-Smith, and Kedar, 2007, p. 22. During Harun al-Rashid's (786‚Äì809) reign the first formal contacts with the Frankish Kingdom of Charlemagne occurred, as part of the attempted Abbasid‚ÄìCarolingian alliance In 797, Harun al-Rashid is reported to have offered the custody of the Christian holy places in Jerusalem to Charlemagne, in return for Charlemagne sending money for construction and improvements.Gil, Moshe (February 1997). A History of Palestine, 634‚Äì1099. Cambridge University Press. pp. 159 and 285‚Äì289. . As a result, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was restored and the Latin hospital was enlarged and placed under the control of the Benedictines. Two years later Charlemagne sent another mission to Patriarch George of Jerusalem. Towards the end of the 9th century, the Baghdad-based Abbasids began to lose control of their western provinces. From 878 Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi- autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with Ahmad ibn Tulun, ruler of Egypt and founder of the Tulunid dynasty, who conquered Palestine and most of Syria four years after declaring Egypt's independence from the Abbasid court in Baghdad. The Abbasids regained direct control of Palestine in 904, after their invasion forced the army of Tulunid Emir Harun to retreat to Egypt, where the Tulunids were defeated the following year. Direct control from Baghdad was maintained until 939 when Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid, governor of Abbasid Egypt and Palestine, was granted independent control over his domain and the title Al-Ikhshid (Prince) by Abbasid Caliph Ar-Radi. Like the Tulunids, the relative proximity of the Ikhshidid capital to Palestine resulted in a greater focus on the region, such that both Ikhshidid rulers, Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid and Abu al-Misk Kafur, were buried in Jerusalem. The death of Abu al-Misk Kafur in 968 resulted in a fatal division of the Ikhshidid government as they prepared for the expected invasion by the Fatimids. =Fatimid period= The Fatimid Caliphate at its greatest extent From their base in Tunisia, General Gawhar Al-Siqilli of the Ismaili Shi'ite Fatimids, who claimed to be descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah, conquered the Ikhshidid domains of Palestine and Egypt in 969, following a treaty guaranteeing the local Sunnis freedom of religion. They moved their capital to the new city of Cairo, just north of the Ikhshidid capital of Fustat. The Fatimids continued their expansion to the borders of the Byzantine Empire, and a failed attack on Antioch in 971 was followed up by a Byzantine defeat outside of Amida. However, the Byzantines fought back and in 975 Emperor John I Tzimiskes's second campaign took Syria and much of northern Palestine, including Tiberias, Nazareth and Caesarea Palaestina, but was defeated en route to Jerusalem. The emperor became ill and died suddenly in 976 on his return from the campaign, and the Byzantines withdrew shortly thereafter to face the Bulgar threat in the north of their empire. Jerusalem, Nablus, and Askalan were expanded and renovated under Fatimid rule. However, in 1009, Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim ordered the destruction of all churches and synagogues in the empire, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. However, this was reversed twenty years later by the Al-Hakim' successor as Caliph, Ali az-Zahir, who authorized the rebuilding of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Christian churches in a treaty with Byzantine Emperor Romanos III Argyros. Romanos' successor Constantine IX Monomachos paid for the restoration, and a number of other Christian buildings, including the Muristan hospital, church and monastery were built during this period. Az-Zahir also undertook a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock during his reign. After the 10th century, the division of Palestine into Junds began to break down. During the early 11th century, Seljuk Turks invaded large portions of West Asia and both the Fatimids and the Byzantines suffered setbacks from the fighting. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuks caused great disruption for the local population and for western pilgrims. In 1073 Palestine was captured by Malik-Shah I's Isfahan-based Great Seljuq EmpireMoshe Gil, A History of Palestine (Cambridge, 1992) p. 410; p. 411 n. 61 under Emir Atsiz ibn Uvaq, who was advancing south into the weakening Fatimid Empire following the decisive defeat over the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert two years previously and a devastating six-year famine in Egypt between 1067 and 1072.Singh, Nagendra. 2002. \\"International Encyclopedia of Islamic Dynasties\\" The Seljuk rule was unpopular, and in 1077 Jerusalem revolted against their rule while Emir Atsiz ibd Uvaq was fighting the Fatimid Empire in Egypt. On his return to Jerusalem, Atsiz re-took the city and massacred the local population.Bosworth, Clifford Edmund. 2007. \\"Historic Cities of the Islamic World As a result, Atsiz was executed by the governor of Syria Tutush I, the brother of Seljuk leader Malik-Shah I. Tutush I appointed Artuq bin Ekseb, later founder of the Artuqid dynasty, as governor. Artuq bin Ekseb died in 1091, and was succeeded as governor by his sons Ilghazi and Sokmen, known as the Artuqid dynasty. Malik Shah died in 1092, and the Great Seljuk Empire split into smaller warring states. Control of Palestine was disputed between Duqaq and Radwan after the death of their father Tutush I in 1095. The ongoing rivalry weakens Syria, and Fatimid Regent Al-Afdal Shahanshah recaptured the region in 1098 from the Artuqids, just before the arrival of the crusaders.Holt, pp. 11‚Äì14. In 1054, the Great Schism formally divided the Christian church into east and west, resulting in the holy sites of Palestine falling under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church. However, in 1090, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos began taking reconciliatory measures towards the Papacy,Norwich, pg. 30 with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before Pope Urban II at the Council of Piacenza, to request mercenary forces, and later that year at the Council of Clermont Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade. =Crusader period: Kingdom of Jerusalem= The kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states at their height in 1135 Crusader states shortly before their fall in 1180 The Kingdom of Jerusalem was a Christian kingdom established in the Levant in 1099 as a result of the First Crusade. Its control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until defeat by Saladin's forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. Shortly after Crusader rule was established in Palestine, Godfrey of Bouillon promised to turn over the rule of the region to the Papacy once the crusaders had captured Egypt. However, the invasion of Egypt did not occur as Godfrey died shortly thereafter and Baldwin was proclaimed the first King of Jerusalem after politically outmanoeuvering Dagobert of Pisa who had previously been appointed as the Latin Patriarch.Runciman, Steven. 1951. A History of the Crusades: Volume 1 The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. New York, New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 279‚Äì290. At first the Crusader kingdom was little more than a loose collection of towns and cities captured during the first crusade. At its height, the kingdom roughly encompassed the territory of modern-day Israel and the State of Palestine. It extended from modern Lebanon in the north to the Sinai Desert in the south, and into modern Jordan and Syria in the east. There were also attempts to expand the kingdom into Fatimid Egypt. Its kings held a certain amount of authority over the other crusader states to the north: the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Edessa. Many customs and institutions were imported from the territories of Western Europe from which the crusaders came, and there were close familial and political connections with the West throughout the kingdom's existence. It was, however, a relatively minor kingdom in comparison and often lacked financial and military support from Europe. Locally based military orders were founded in the kingdom to fill this vacuum. The foundation of the Knights Hospitaller by Gerard Thom at the Muristan Christian hospice in Jerusalem was confirmed by a Papal Bull from Pope Paschal II in 1113, and the founding by Hugues de Payens and Godfrey de Saint-Omer of the Knights Templar took place in 1119 in the Al Aqsa Mosque. The kingdom grew closer to the neighbouring Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and the Byzantine Empire, from which it inherited \\"oriental\\" qualities, and the kingdom was also influenced by pre-existing Muslim institutions. However, when Arnulf of Chocques was appointed Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem for the second time in 1112, he prohibited non-Catholic worship at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Socially, the \\"Latin\\" inhabitants from Western Europe had almost no contact with the Muslims and Eastern Christians whom they ruled. The Royal Palace of the Kingdom was based in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock was converted into a church. Under the Crusader rule, fortifications, castles, towers and fortified villages were built, rebuilt and renovated across Palestine largely in rural areas. A notable urban remnant of the Crusader architecture of this era is found in Acre's old city and on the island of Arwad. Numerous Muslim families emigrated Palestine during this period, including those of notable Islamic scholars Ibn Qudamah and Diya al-Din al- Maqdisi. During the period of Crusader control, it has been estimated that Palestine had only 1,000 poor Jewish families.Frank Heynick, Jews and medicine, An Epic Saga, KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2002 p. 103, commenting on Maimonidies' decision not to settle there a century later. Jews fought alongside the Muslims against the Crusaders in Jerusalem in 1099 and Haifa in 1100. Some Jews from Europe visited the country, like Benjamin of Tudela who wrote about it. A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East (vol 5), By Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard, Marshall Whithed Baldwin, Robert Lee Wolff, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1985, , , pp. 96. Maimonides visited Palestine after escaping from the Almohads in 1165 and visited Acre, Jerusalem and Hebron, finally choosing to settle in Fostat in Egypt.Sefer HaCharedim Mitzvat Tshuva Chapter 3 In July 1187, the Cairo- based Kurdish General Saladin commanded his troops to victory in the Battle of Hattin,Kenneth Setton, ed. A History of the Crusades, vol. I. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1958Shahin (2005), p. 12. shortly followed by the Siege of Jerusalem (1187) in which Saladin captured Jerusalem. =Ayyubid and Mamluk periods= Jerusalem under the Ayyubid dynasty after the death of Saladin, 1193 The Bahri Mamluk dynasty 1250‚Äì1382 Tower of Ramla, constructed in 1318 Following the crusader defeat by Saladin's forces in 1187, most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. A rump crusader state in the northern coastal cities known as the Kingdom of Acre survived in the region for another hundred years until 1291, throughout the Ayyubid Period and well into the Mamluk Period. However, despite seven further crusades from Europe, the crusader state was no longer a significant power in the region after the fall of Jerusalem in 1187. The Ayyubids allowed Jewish and Orthodox Christian settlement in the region, and the Dome of the Rock was converted back into an Islamic center of worship. The Mosque of Omar was built under Saladin outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, commemorating Umar the Great's decision to pray outside the church so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the church's status as a Christian site. About eighty years after Saladin's conquest, the Catalan Rabbi Nahmanides left Europe following the disputation of Barcelona,p. 73 in Jonathan Sachs (2005) To heal a fractured world: the ethics of responsibility. London: Continuum () and spent the last three years of his life in Palestine, primarily in Acre. He established the Ramban Synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem and thus, having found only two Jewish people living in the city at the time, re-established Jewish communal life in Jerusalem. The defeat of the Europeans provoked further crusades from Europe, varying in size and success. In 1192, after preventing the Third Crusade under Richard the Lionheart from recapturing Jerusalem, Saladin entered into the Treaty of Ramla in which he agreed that Western Christian pilgrims could worship freely in Jerusalem. The threat remained, however, and Ayyubid Emir Al-Mu'azzam destroyed Jerusalem's city walls in 1219 to prevent the Crusaders from capturing a fortified city. To end the Sixth Crusade, a 10-year treaty was signed between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Ayyubid Sultan Al- Kamil, allowing Christians freedom to live in the unfortified Jerusalem, as well as Nazareth and Bethlehem, although the Ayyubids retained control of the Muslim holy places. These areas were returned to Ayyubid control after the peace treaty expired in 1239 and An-Nasir Dawud, Ayyubid Emir of Kerak, occupied the cities. For the four following years, control of the cities was contested between An-Nasir Dawud and his cousin As-Salih Ayyub who had allied with the crusaders, aided by the diplomatic efforts of Thibaut IV of Champagne. In order to permanently retake the city from the rival breakaway rulers who had allied with the crusaders, As-Salih Ayyub summoned a mercenary army of Khwarezmians, who were available for hire following the defeat of the Khwarazm Shah dynasty by the Mongols ten years earlier. The Khwarezmians could not be controlled by As-Salih Ayyub, and destroyed Jerusalem. A few months later, the two sides met again at the decisive Battle of La Forbie, marking the end of the Crusader influence in southern and central Palestine. Two years later the Ayyubids regained control of Jerusalem after the Khwarezmians were defeated by Al-Mansur Ibrahim at Lake Homs. The Mamluk Sultanate was indirectly created in Egypt as a result of the Seventh Crusade, which had been launched in reaction to the 1244 destruction of Jerusalem. The crusade failed after Louis IX of France was defeated and captured by Ayyubid Sultan Turanshah at the Battle of Fariskur in 1250. Turanshah was killed by his Mamluk soldiers a month after the battle and his step-mother Shajar al-Durr became Sultana of Egypt with the Mamluk Aybak as Atabeg. The Ayyubids relocated to Damascus, where they continued to control Palestine for a further 10 years. In the late 13th century, Palestine and Syria became the primary front against the fast- expanding Mongol Empire, whose army reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the Mongol raids into Palestine under Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa. Mongol leader Hulagu Khan sent a message to Louis IX of France that Jerusalem had been remitted to the Christians under the Franco- Mongol Alliance; however, shortly thereafter he had to return to Mongolia following the death of Mongke, leaving Kitbuqa and a reduced army. Kitbuqa then engaged with the Mamluks under Baibars in the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut in the Jezreel Valley. The Mamluks' decisive victory in Palestine is seen as one of world history's most significant battles, establishing a high-water mark for the Mongol conquests. The Mongols were, however, able to engage into some further brief raids in 1300 under Ghazan and Mulay, reaching as far as Gaza. Jerusalem was held by the Mongols for four months (see Ninth Crusade). In 1270, Sultan Baibars expelled the remaining Crusaders from most of the country, and the last major Crusader stronghold, Acre, fell in 1291, at the Siege of Acre. Thereafter, any remaining Europeans either went home or merged with the local population. The Mamluks, continuing the policy of the Ayyubids, made the strategic decision to destroy the coastal area and to bring desolation to many of its cities, from Tyre in the north to Gaza in the south. Ports were destroyed and various materials were dumped to make them inoperable. The goal was to prevent attacks from the sea, given the fear of the return of the crusaders. This had a long-term effect on those areas, which remained sparsely populated for centuries. The activity in that time concentrated more inland.Myriam Rosen-Ayalon, \`\`Between Cairo and Damascus: Rural Life and Urban Economics in the Holy Land During the Ayyuid, Maluk and Ottoman Periods in The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land edited Thomas Evan Levy, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1998 Palestine formed a part of the Damascus Wilayah (district) under the rule of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and was divided into three smaller sanjaks (subdivisions) with capitals in Jerusalem, Gaza, and Safed. Due in part to the many conflicts, earthquakes and the Black Death that hit the region during this era, the population is estimated to have dwindled to around 200,000. The Mamluks constructed a \\"postal road\\" from Cairo to Damascus, that included lodgings for travelers (khans) and bridges, some of which survive to this day (see Jisr Jindas, near Lod). The period also saw the construction of many schools and the renovation of mosques neglected or destroyed during the Crusader period. In 1377 the major cities of Palestine and Syria revolted, following the death of Al-Ashraf Sha'ban. The revolt was quelled and a coup d'etat was staged by Barquq in Cairo in 1382, founding the Mamluk Burji dynasty. Palestine was celebrated by Arab and Muslim writers of the time as the \\"blessed land of the prophets and Islam's revered leaders\\"; Muslim sanctuaries were \\"rediscovered\\" and received many pilgrims. In 1496, Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi wrote his history of Palestine known as The Glorious History of Jerusalem and Hebron. Ottoman periodEarly Ottoman rule= The Ottoman Empire in 1683, showing Jerusalem In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Turks in a battle for control over western Asia. The Ottomans proceeded to conquer Palestine following their 1516 victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq.Chase, 2003, pp. 104‚Äì105. The Ottoman conquest of Palestine was relatively swift, with small battles fought against the Mamluks in the Jordan Valley and at Khan Yunis en route to the Mamluk capital in Egypt. There were also minor uprisings in Gaza, Ramla and Safad, which were quickly suppressed.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 2. The Ottomans maintained the administrative and political organisation that the Mamluks left in Palestine. Greater Syria became an eyalet (province) ruled from Damascus, while the Palestine region within it was divided into the five sanjaks (provincial districts, also called liwa‚Ä≤ in Arabic) of Safad, Nablus, Jerusalem, Lajjun and Gaza.Doumani, 1995, p. 34.Gerber, 1998, pp. 565‚Äì566. The sanjaks were further subdivided into subdistricts called nawahi (sing. nahiya). For much of the 16th century, the Ottomans ruled Damascus Eyalet in a centralised way, with the Istanbul-based Sublime Porte (imperial government) playing a crucial role in maintaining public order and domestic security, collecting taxes, and regulating the economy, religious affairs and social welfare.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 35. Most of Palestine's population, estimated to be around 200,000 in the early years of Ottoman rule, lived in villages. The largest cities were Gaza, Safad and Jerusalem, each with a population of around 5,000‚Äì6,000. Ottoman property administration consisted of a system of fiefs called timar and trusts called waqf. Timar lands were distributed by the sultan to various officers and officials, particularly from the elite sipahi units. A timar was a source of income for its holder, who was responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the law in the timar. Waqf land was owned by various individuals and its revenues were dedicated to religious functions and institutions, social welfare and individual beneficiaries. Over 60% of cultivated land in the Jerusalem Sanjak was waqf land. To a lesser extent, there was also privately owned land predominantly located within villages and their immediate vicinity. The name \\"Palestine\\" was no longer used as the official name of an administrative unit under the Ottomans because they typically named provinces after their capitals. Nonetheless, the old name remained in popular and semi- official use,Gerber, 1998. with many examples of its usage in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries surviving. The 16th-century Jerusalem-based Islamic jurist Sayf al-Islam Abu'l Sa'ud Effendi defined the term as an alternative name for Arazi-i Muqaddas (Turkish for \\"the Holy Land\\"). The 17th-century Ramla-based jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli often used the term \\"Filastin\\" in his fatawat (religious edicts) without defining the term, although some of his fatawat suggest that it more or less corresponded with the borders of Jund Filastin. Thomas Salmon's 18th-century book, Modern history or, the present state of all nations, states that \\"Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine, though much fallen from its ancient grandeur.\\" =Decentralization process=Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay period By the end of the 16th century, direct Ottoman rule over Damascus Eyalet was weakened, partly due to the Jelali revolts and other Anatolian insurrections. The timar system, which functioned to serve the fiscal and military needs of the Ottoman government, was also becoming less relevant during this period.Scholch, ed. Qusner, 1986, p. 140. Consequently, a new governing elite emerged in Palestine consisting of the Ridwan, Farrukh and Turabay dynasties whose members provided the district governors of the Gaza, Nablus, Jerusalem and Lajjun sanjaks between the late 16th century and the late 17th century. The stability of their rule varied by sanjak, with Ridwan control of Gaza, Turabay control of Lajjun, and Farrukh control of Nablus largely continuous, and the Ridwan-Farrukh hold over Jerusalem frequently interrupted by governors appointed from Istanbul.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 56. Ties between the families were solidified through inter-marriage, business and political cooperation.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 39. From the late 16th century until the early 18th century, the prestigious post of amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan) would often be assigned to the district governor of Nablus or Gaza. This tradition laid the foundation for a durable military alliance between the three families since the departing amir al-hajj from one of these families would entrust authority over his sanjak to the governor of the neighboring sanjak.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 49. Gradually, the ties between the Ridwan, Farrukh and Turabay families led to the establishment of a single extended dynasty that held sway over much of Palestine.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 39 and p. 47. In 1622, the Druze emir (prince) of Mount Lebanon, Fakhr-al-Din II gained control of Safad Sanjak and was appointed governor of Nablus and mutasallim (chief tax collector) of Gaza. Alarmed at the looming threat to their rule, the Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay alliance prepared for a confrontation with Fakhr ad-Din by pooling their financial resources to acquire arms and bribe Bedouin tribes to fight alongside them. They were also tacitly supported by the Sublime Porte, which was wary of Fakhr ad-Din's growing autonomy. When Fakhr ad-Din's better-equipped army launched an offensive to gain control of Palestine's coastal plain and Jerusalem, the army of Hasan 'Arab Ridwan, Ahmad Turabay and Muhammad ibn Farrukh routed his forces at the Awja River near Jaffa. In 1624, following the Battle of Anjar, Fakhr ad-Din was appointed the \\"Emir of Arabistan\\" by the Ottomans, which gave him official authority over the region between Aleppo and Jerusalem. He was deposed and hanged a decade later by the Wali of Damascus Imperial attempts at centralization Gaza's political influence in Palestine rose under the Ridwan dynasty, particularly during the governorship of Husayn Pasha, which began in the 1640s. It was considered the \\"capital of Palestine\\" by the French consul of Jerusalem, Chevalier d'Arvieux.Sharon, 2009, p. 197.Labat, 1735, p. 46. Husayn's closeness with France and his good relations with Palestine's Christian communities were a source of imperial consternation at his rule.Filiu, 2014, p. 27. Concurrently, in the mid-17th century, the Ottoman government guided by the K√∂pr√ºl√º viziers attempted to restore centralized authority over its outlier provinces.Ze'evi, p. 57. One of the centralization measures introduced by Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha was the establishment of the Sidon Eyalet in 1660, which administratively separated Safad Sanjak from the rest of Palestine, which remained part of Damascus Eyalet. This reorganization was done to both weaken the ambitious governors of Damascus and to maintain stricter control over the rebellious emirs of Mount Lebanon.Joudah, 1987, p. 14. With the elimination of Fakhr ad-Din's threat to Ottoman control in the Levant, the Sublime Porte sought to bring an end to the Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay dynasty. Beside concern over their increasing consolidation of power in Palestine, the Sublime Porte was frustrated by the substantially decreased revenues from the annual Hajj caravan, which a governor from one of the three families often commanded. In 1657, the Ottoman authorities launched a military expedition in Palestine to reassert imperial control over the region because of its strategic importance in the funding and protection of the Hajj caravan and also because it was a crucial link to Egypt.Doumani, 1995, p. 36. The Sublime Porte used Husayn Pasha's alleged incompetence leading the Hajj caravan in 1662‚Äì63 to imprison and execute him.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 41. Husayn Pasha served as the foundation of the Ridwan- Farrukh-Turabay alliance and his death was followed by the Sublime Porte's gradual elimination of the rest of the extended dynasty by the late 1670s.Ze'evi, 1996, pp. 58‚Äì59. Ridwan rule persisted in Gaza until 1690.Filiu, 2014, p. 28. The elimination of the Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay dynasty and their replacement by governors appointed by the Ottoman government \\"radically changed the state of affairs\\" in Palestine, according to historian Dror Ze'evi.Ze'evi, 1996, p. 60. The appointed governors abandoned the relationships that the local dynasties maintained with the local elites and largely ignored the increasing exploitation of the populace by the Janissaries, subashis and timar holders. Official complaints to the Sublime Porte about the latter groups skyrocketed among Muslims, Christians and Jews alike. Many peasants abandoned their villages to avoid exploitation, townspeople complained about the seizure of their property and the ulama (Muslim scholarly class) complained about the Janissaries' disregard for justice and the sanctity of Muslim places of worship, including the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif). In reaction to this state of affairs, in 1703, an uprising, known as the Naqib al-Ashraf Revolt, by the people of Jerusalem took place, led by the chief of the ashraf families, Muhammad ibn Mustafa al- Husayni, and backed by the city's notables. The home of Jerusalem's qadi, a symbol of imperial authority, was ransacked and his translator killed by rebels. They proceeded to govern the city themselves until an Ottoman siege and internal strife forced al-Husayni and his rebels to withdraw from Jerusalem in October 1705. Meanwhile, the mostly Arab sipahi officers of the 1657 centralization expedition, chief among them members of the Nimr clan, settled in Nablus and, contrary to the Sublime Porte's intention, began forming their own local power bases in the city's rural hinterland from the timars they were assigned.Doumani, 1995, pp. 36‚Äì37. Towards the end of the 17th century, they were soon followed by the Jarrar and Tuqan clans, who like the Nimrs, came from other parts of Ottoman Syria. The sheikhs (chiefs) of these clans soon emerged as the new nobility of central Palestine. They developed increasingly close ties to the local population through selling or leasing their timars to rural notables, investing in local commerce, property and businesses such as soap factories, and intermarrying and partnering with local ashraf and mercantile families. Politically, the Tuqans and Nimrs dominated the governorship of Nablus and at times controlled other districts and subdistrictsDoumani, 1995, p. 39. (in 1723 Salih Pasha Tuqan was governor of the Nablus, Lajjun and Gaza sanjaks).Doumani, 1995, p. 38. The Jarrars were the dominant clan of the Nablus hinterland, although other clans, among them the Mamluk-era Jayyusis, continued to hold influence in their respective subdistricts. This state of affairs in Jabal Nablus persisted with minor interruptions until the mid-19th century. =Rule of Acre and autonomy of Nablus=Zaydani period Zahir al-Umar's autonomous sheikhdom in 1774 In the mid-17th century, the Zaydani clan became a formidable force in northern Palestine. Initially, its sheikhs were appointed as multazems (tax collectors and local enforcers) of iltizam (tax farms) in parts of the Galilee by the Ma'ani, and, after 1697, the Shihabi emirs of Mount Lebanon.Joudah, 1987, p. 20. In 1730, Zaydani sheikh Zahir al-Umar was directly appointed by the Wali of Sidon as the multazem of Tiberias, which he soon fortified,Joudah, 1987, p. 23. along with other Zaydani strongholds such as Deir Hanna, Arraba and Nazareth. Between that time and 1750, Zahir had consolidated his control over the entire Galilee.Joudah, 1987, p. 25. He transferred his headquarters to the port village of Acre, which he renovated and refortified. Acre became the center of an expanding autonomous sheikhdom financed by a monopoly on cotton and other agricultural commodities from Palestine and southern Lebanon established by Zahir.Sluglett, p. 94. Zahir's control of cotton and olive oil prices drew great revenues from European merchants, and these funds enabled him to marshal military resources needed to fend off military assaults by the governors of Damascus. Moreover, the monopolies ended the foreign merchants' manipulation of prices and financial exploitation of the local peasantry.Joudah, 1987, p. 39. Together with significantly improved general security and social justice, Zahir's economic policies made him popular with the local inhabitants.Philipp, 2013, p. 32. Zahir also encouraged immigration to Palestine and his rule attracted large numbers of Jews and Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from throughout Ottoman Syria, revitalizing the region's economy. Zahir founded modern-day Haifa in 1769. In the early 1770s, Zahir allied himself with the Russian Empire and Ali Bey of Egypt. Together with Ali Bey's deputy commanders Ismail Bey and Abu al-Dhahab, and backed by the Russian Navy, Zahir and his Lebanese Shia allies invaded Damascus and Sidon. Ali Bey's commanders abruptly withdrew from Damascus after briefly capturing it in June 1771,Rogan, 2012, p. 51. compelling Zahir to withdraw from Sidon shortly thereafter.Joudah, 1987, p. 81. Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, the Wali of Damascus, renewed his campaign to eliminate Zahir, but his forces were routed at Lake Hula in September 1771.Joudah, 1987, pp. 84‚Äì85. Zahir followed up this decisive victory with another major victory against Emir Yusuf Shihab's Druze forces at Nabatieh.Joudah, 1987, p. 86. By 1774, Zahir's rule extended from Gaza to Beirut and included most of Palestine.Philipp, 2013, pp. 43‚Äì44. The year after, however, a coalition of Ottoman forces besieged and killed him at his Acre headquarters.Joudah, 1987, pp. 115‚Äì116. The Ottoman commander Jazzar Pasha subsequently waged a campaign that destroyed Deir Hanna's fort and ended Zaydani rule in the Galilee in 1776.Joudah, 1987, p. 117. Although Acre and the Galilee were part of Sidon Eyalet while the rest of Palestine administratively belonged to Damascus, it was the rulers of Acre, beginning with Zahir, that dominated Palestine and the southern Syrian districts.Doumani, 1995, p. 40. Damascus governors typically held office for short periods of time and were often occupied with protecting and leading the Hajj caravan (the office of amir al-hajj had become the responsibility of the Wali of Damascus in 1708),Doumani, 1995, p. 268. preventing them from asserting their authority over semi-autonomous areas such as the Nablus region. In contrast, Zahir established Acre as a virtually autonomous entity, a process seen in other parts of the Ottoman Empire including Egypt, Mount Lebanon and Mosul.Doumani, 1995, pp. 40‚Äì41. Moreover, Acre became the de facto capital of Sidon Eyalet during and after Zahir's reign, and like Zahir, his successors ruled Acre until their deaths. There were several military confrontations between Zahir and the Jarrar clan starting in 1735 when the former occupied the latter's territory of Nazareth and the Jezreel Valley, which served as trade and transportation hubs.Doumani, 1995, p. 42. Meanwhile, in 1766, the Tuqan clan had ousted the Jayyusis from the Bani Sa'b subdistrict, which was then occupied by Zahir in 1771, stripping Nablus of its sea access.Doumani, 1995, p. 95. The conflict between Zahir and the Tuqans culminated with the former's unsuccessful siege of Nablus later that year.Doumani, 1995, p. 43. Jazzari period An illustration of Jazzar Pasha's court Jazzar Pasha was appointed Wali of Sidon by the Sublime Porte for his role in uprooting the Zaydani sheikhdom.Yazbak, 1998, p. 16. Unlike the Galilee-born Zahir, Jazzar was a product of the Ottoman state and a force for Ottoman centralization,Kramer, 2011, p. 61. yet he also pursued his own agenda, extending his influence throughout the southern half of Ottoman Syria.Kramer, 2011, p. 62. Jazzar assumed control over Zahir's cotton monopoly and further strengthened the fortifications of Acre, where he was based.Sluglett, pp. 171‚Äì172. He financed his rule through income generated from the cotton trade, as well as taxes, tolls and extortion. Tensions between Jazzar and the French cotton merchants of Acre ended with the latter being expelled in the late 1780s,Philipp, 1998, p. 8. at a time when prices for Palestine's cotton were declining due to alternative sources elsewhere. Like Zahir, Jazzar was able to maintain domestic security by suppressing the Bedouin tribes. However, the local peasantry did not fare well under his stringent taxation policies, which resulted in many leaving the Galilee for neighboring areas. To protect his rule, he raised a personal army of mamluks (slave soldiers) and mercenaries consisting of troops from different parts of the Islamic world. Jazzar established close ties with the Tuqan clan, who were traditionally aligned with the Ottoman authorities. However, the Tuqans' chief rival, the Jarrar clan, resisted his attempts at centralization and Jazzar besieged them at their Sanur fortress in 1790 and 1795, both times ending in defeat. In February 1799, Emperor Napoleon of France entered Palestine after conquering Egypt as part of his campaign against the Ottomans, who were allied with his enemy, the British Empire. He occupied Gaza and moved north along Palestine's coastal plain,Filiu, 2014, p. 29. capturing Jaffa, where his forces massacred some 3,000 Ottoman troops who had surrendered and many civilians.McGregor, 2006, p. 44. His forces then captured Haifa and used it as a staging ground for their siege of Acre.Yazbak, 1998, p. 17. Napoleon called for Jewish support to capture Jerusalem. This was done to gain favor with Haim Farhi, Jazzar's Jewish vizier. The invasion rallied the sheikhs of Jabal Nablus, with the multazem of Jenin, Sheikh Yusuf al-Jarrar, beckoning them to combat the French.Doumani, 1995, p. 16. In contrast to the sheikhs of the Hebron Hills and Jerusalem who provided conscripts to the Ottoman Army, the sheikhs of Jabal Nablus fought independently, to the chagrin of the Sublime Porte.Doumani, 1995, pp. 18‚Äì19. Their men were defeated by the French in the Galilee.Herold, 2009, p. 320. Napoleon failed to conquer Acre and his defeat by Jazzar's forces, backed by the British, compelled him to withdraw from Palestine with heavy losses in May.McGregor, 2006, pp. 44‚Äì45. Jazzar's victory significantly boosted his prestige. The Ottomans pursued the French in Egypt in 1800, using Gaza as their launch point. Jazzar Mosque in Acre. Its founder, Jazzar Pasha, and his successor, Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, are buried in the mosque's courtyard Jazzar died in 1804 and was succeeded as Wali of Sidon by his trusted mamluk Sulayman Pasha al-Adil. Sulayman, under Farhi's guidance, undertook a policy of loosening his predecessors' monopolies on the cotton, olive oil and grain trades.Doumani, 1995, pp. 100‚Äì101. However, he also established Acre as the only Levantine port city allowed to export these cash crops.Philipp, 2013, p. 85. He also made significant cuts to Acre's military and adopted a decentralization policy of non-interference with his deputy governors, such as Muhammad Abu-Nabbut of Jaffa, and diplomacy with various autonomous sheikhs, such as Musa Bey Tuqan of Nablus. This marked a departure from the violent approach of Jazzar. By 1810, Sulayman was appointed to Damascus Eyalet, giving him control over most of Ottoman Syria. Before he was dismissed from the latter in 1812, he managed to have the sanjaks of Latakia, Tripoli and Gaza annexed to Sidon Eyalet.Philipp, 2013, p. 82.Mattar, 2005, p. 344. Towards the end of his rule, in 1817, a civil war broke out in Jabal Nablus between the Tuqans and a coalition of the Nimr, Jarrar, Qasim and Abd al-Hadi clans over Musa Bey's attempt to monopolize power in Nablus by ousting the Nimrs. Sulayman mediated between the clans and secured a temporary peace in 1818.Philipp, 2013, p. 84 Abdullah Pasha, groomed by Farhi for leadership,Mishaqah, p. 125. succeeded Sulayman in 1820 nine months after the latter's death in 1819. Ottoman hesitation to appoint Abdullah was mitigated after persistent lobbying and bribery of Ottoman imperial officials by Farhi. Unlike Jazzar's mamluks who sought the governorship, Farhi did not view his prot√©g√© Abdullah to be a threat to his influence.Philipp, 2013, p. 86. Nonetheless, Abdullah had Farhi executed less than a year into his rule as the result of a power struggle.Philipp, p. 90. Abdullah more or less continued his predecessor's alliance with Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon and together they confronted the Wali of Damascus.Mishaqah, pp. 131‚Äì132. The Ottoman authorities, instigated by Farhi's relatives,Philipp, pp. 91‚Äì92. attempted to oust Abdullah in a siege against Acre, but Muhammad Ali, Wali of Egypt, persuaded the Ottomans to keep Abdullah as governor. In 1830, the Sidon Eyalet was assigned the sanjaks of Nablus, Jerusalem and Hebron, thereby bringing all of Palestine under a single province.Philipp, p. 93. That year, the Jarrars led a revolt against Abdullah, who thereafter besieged and destroyed Sanur's fortress, which had successfully resisted sieges by his predecessors. Abdullah's rule was marked by declining revenues from the cotton trade, efforts to reassert Acre's monopolies and poverty in Palestine. Nonetheless, Acre under Abdullah remained the principal force in Ottoman Syria due to instability in Damascus and the Ottomans' preoccupation with the war in Greece.Philipp, pp. 92‚Äì93. =Centralization= \\"Independent\\" Vilayet of Jerusalem shown within Ottoman administrative divisions in the Eastern Mediterranean coast after the reorganisation of 1887‚Äì88 Egyptian period In October 1831, Muhammad Ali of Egypt dispatched his modernized army commanded by his son Ibrahim Pasha in a campaign to annex Ottoman Syria, including Palestine. Ibrahim Pasha's forces had previously defeated the Ottomans and gained control of Sudan and the western Arabian Peninsula. Their entry into Palestine was not resisted by the local inhabitants,Mattar, p. 344. nor by the rural sheikhs of the central highlands.Doumani, 1995 However, Abdullah Pasha resisted the conquest from Acre, which was besieged and ultimately surrendered in May 1832.Mishaqah, p. 169. Egyptian rule brought on major political and administrative reforms to Palestine and Ottoman Syria in general, and represented a radical change from the semi-autonomous rule that existed in the region prior to Muhammad Ali's conquest. Among the significant measures established by Ibrahim Pasha to bring all of Syria under a single administration was the introduction of the advisory councils whose purpose was to standardize the diverse political configurations of Syria. The councils, based in the major cities, were composed of religious leaders, wealthy merchants and urban leaders, and functioned as administrative centers. In effect, they solidified urban control and economic domination of the hinterland, according to historian Beshara Doumani.Doumani, 1995, p. 46. Ibrahim Pasha also instituted the disarmament and conscription of the peasantry, a policy carried out by Muhammad Ali in Egypt to establish centralized rule and a modern army.Doumani, 1995, pp. 44‚Äì45. Conscription and disarmament were highly unpopular among the peasantry and their leaders, who refused to implement the orders. New taxation policies also threatened the role of urban notables and rural sheikhs as mutasallims, while Egypt's effective law enforcement measures threatened the livelihood of Bedouin tribes who derived their income from extorting merchants and travelers. The diverse array of social and political groups hostile to Egyptian reforms throughout Palestine developed into a coalition.Kimmerling, 2012, p. 68. Consequently, this coalition launched what became known as the Peasants' Revolt in 1834. The core of the rebels were based in Jabal Nablus and led by subdistrict chief Qasim al-Ahmad, who had previously contributed peasant irregulars to Ibrahim Pasha's forces during the conquest of Syria.Rood, p. 81. The revolt represented a major threat to the flow of arms and conscripts between Egypt and Syria and to Muhammad Ali's program of modernizing Egypt.Kimmerling, p. 10. Rebel forces captured most of Palestine, including Jerusalem, by June. However, Muhammad Ali arrived in Palestine, opened negotiations with various rebel leaders and sympathizers, and secured a truce in July.Rood, pp. 132‚Äì133. He also managed to secure the defection of the powerful Abu Ghosh clan of Jerusalem's hinterland from the rebel forces.Kimmerling, 2012, p. 67. During the truce period, numerous religious and political leaders from Jerusalem and other cities were either arrested, exiled or executed. Afterward, Qasim recommenced the rebellion, viewing the truce as a ruse. Egyptian forces launched a campaign to defeat the rebels in Jabal Nablus, destroying 16 villages before capturing Nablus itself on 15 July. Qasim was pursued to Hebron, which was leveled in August, and was later captured and executed with most of the rebel leadership. In the wake of Egypt's victory, the virtual autonomy of Jabal Nablus was significantly weakened, the conscription orders were carried out with 10,000 peasant conscripts sent to Egypt, and the population was largely disarmed. The latter measure effectively introduced a monopoly of violence in Palestine, as part of Egypt's centralization policies.Kimmerling, 2003, p. 11. Egyptian rule and the defeat of the powerful rural sheikhs of Jabal Nablus led to the political elevation of the Abd al- Hadi clan of Arraba. Its sheikh, Husayn Abd al-Hadi, supported Ibrahim Pasha during the revolt and was promoted as the Wali of Sidon, which included all of Palestine. His relatives and allies were appointed the mutasallims of Jerusalem, Nablus and Jaffa.Rood, p. 96. Britain sent the navy to shell Beirut and an Anglo-Ottoman expeditionary force landed, causing local uprisings against the Egyptian occupiers. A British naval squadron anchored off Alexandria. The Egyptian army retreated to Egypt. Muhammad Ali signed the Treaty of 1841. Britain returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans, and as a result was able to increase the extraterritorial rights that various European nations had enjoyed throughout previous centuries under the terms of the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. One American diplomat wrote that \\"Extraordinary privileges and immunities had become so embodied in successive treaties between the great Christian Powers and the Sublime Porte that for most intents and purposes many nationalities in the Ottoman Empire formed a state within the state.\\"The Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire and the Question of their Abrogation as it Affects the United States, Lucius Ellsworth Thayer, The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 17, No. 2 (April, 1923), pp. 207‚Äì233 Restoration of Ottoman control In common usage from 1840 onward, \\"Palestine\\" was used either to describe the consular jurisdictions of the Western powers or for a region that extended in the north‚Äìsouth direction typically from Rafah (south-east of Gaza) to the Litani River (now in Lebanon). The western boundary was the sea, and the eastern boundary was the poorly defined place where the Syrian desert began. In various European sources, the eastern boundary was placed anywhere from the Jordan River to slightly east of Amman. The Negev Desert was not included.Biger, Gideon (1981). Where was Palestine? Pre-World War I perception, AREA (Journal of the Institute of British Geographers) Vol 13, No. 2, pp. 153‚Äì160. The Consuls were originally magistrates who tried cases involving their own citizens in foreign territories. While the jurisdictions in the secular states of Europe had become territorial, the Ottomans perpetuated the legal system they inherited from the Byzantine Empire. The law in many matters was personal, not territorial, and the individual citizen carried his nation's law with him wherever he went.The Abrogation of the Turkish Capitulations, Norman Bentwich, Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, Third Series, Vol. 5, No. 4 (1923), pp. 182‚Äì188 Capitulatory law applied to foreigners in Palestine. Only Consular Courts of the State of the foreigners concerned were competent to try them. That was true, not only in cases involving personal status, but also in criminal and commercial matters.Raja Shehadeh, Kluwer Law International, 1997, , p. 75 According to American Ambassador Morgenthau, Turkey had never been an independent sovereignty.Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, Henry Morgenthau, Cornell University Library 2009, , Chapter 10, p. 70 The Western Powers had their own courts, marshals, colonies, schools, postal systems, religious institutions, and prisons. The Consuls also extended protections to large communities of Jewish prot√©g√©s who had settled in Palestine.The Habsburgs and the Jewish Philanthropy in Jerusalem during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì6), Yochai Ben-Ghedalia, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2009 The Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities of Palestine were allowed to exercise jurisdiction over their own members according to charters granted to them. For centuries the Jews and Christians had enjoyed a large degree of communal autonomy in matters of worship, jurisdiction over personal status, taxes, and in managing their schools and charitable institutions. In the 19th century those rights were formally recognized as part of the Tanzimat reforms and when the communities were placed under the protection of European public law.See Jews, Turks, Ottomans, Avigdor Levy (Editor) Syracuse University Press, 2003, , p. 109; Christian communities in Jerusalem and the West Bank since 1948, By Daphne Tsimhoni, Praeger, 1993, , p. xvSee International law: achievements and prospects, UNESCO, editor Mohammed Bedjaoui, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991, , p. 7 In the 1860s, the Ottoman military was able to restore order east of Jordan by halting tribal conflicts and Bedouin raids. This invited migration to the east, notably the Salt area, from various populations in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine to take advantage of new lands. This influx amounted to some 12,000 over the period from 1880 to just before the First World War, while the Bedouin population east of Jordan increased to 56,000.Heikki Palva, Negations in the dialect of es-Salt, Jordan, university of Helsinki, in, Martine Haak, Rudolf de Jong, Kees Versteegh, eds., Approaches to Arabic dialects: A collection of articles presented to Manfred Woidich on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 2004, p. 223 However, with the creation of the Transjordanian emirate in 1921‚Äì22, the hamlet of Amman, which had been recently resettled by Circassians, attracted most of the new immigrants from Palestine, and many of those that had previously moved to Salt.Heikki Palva, Negations in the dialect of es-Salt, Jordan, university of Helsinki, in, Martine Haak, Rudolf de Jong, Kees Versteegh, eds., Approaches to Arabic dialects: A collection of articles presented to Manfred Woidich on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 2004, pp. 223‚Äì224 Map of \\"Palestine\\" in 1851, showing the Kaza subdivisions. At the time, the region shown was split between the Sidon Eyalet and the Damascus Eyalet In the reorganisation of 1873, which established the administrative boundaries that remained in place until 1914, Palestine was split between three major administrative units. The northern part, above a line connecting Jaffa to north Jericho and the Jordan, was assigned to the vilayet of Beirut, subdivided into the sanjaks (districts) of Acre, Beirut and Nablus. The southern part, from Jaffa downwards, was part of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, a special district under the direct authority of Istanbul. Its southern boundaries were unclear but petered out in the eastern Sinai Peninsula and northern Negev Desert. Most of the central and southern Negev was assigned to the vilayet of Hejaz, which also included the Sinai Peninsula and the western part of Arabia.Gideon Biger, The Boundaries of Modern Palestine, 1840‚Äì1947, pp. 13‚Äì15. Routledge, 2004. The Ottomans regarded \\"Filistin\\" as an abstract term referring to the \\"Holy Land\\", and not one consistently applied to a clearly defined area.Bernard Lewis, \\"Palestine: On the History and Geography of a Name\\", International History Review 11 (1980): 1‚Äì12 Among the educated Arab public, Filastin was a common concept, referring either to the whole of Palestine or to the Jerusalem sanjak alonePorath, 1974, pp. 8‚Äì9. or just to the area around Ramle.Haim Gerber (1998) referring to fatwas by two Hanafite Syrian jurists. The publication of the daily paper Falastin (Palestine) from 1911 was one example of the increasing currency of this concept.Strawson, John (2010), pp. 25. The rise of Zionism, the national movement of the Jewish people started in Europe in the 19th century seeking to recreate a Jewish state in Palestine, and return the original homeland of the Jewish people. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration. The \\"First Aliyah\\" was the first modern widespread wave of aliyah. Jews who migrated to Palestine in this wave came mostly from Eastern Europe and from Yemen. This wave of aliyah began in 1881‚Äì82 and lasted until 1903,Scharfstein, Sol, Chronicle of Jewish History: From the Patriarchs to the 21st Century, p. 231, Ktav Publishing House (1997), bringing an estimated 25,000‚Äì35,000 Jews to Erez Israel. The First Aliyah laid the cornerstone for Jewish settlement in Israel and created several settlements such as Rishon LeZion, Rosh Pina, Zikhron Ya'akov and Gedera. In 1891, a group of Jerusalem notables sent a petition to the central Ottoman government in Istanbul calling for the cessation of Jewish immigration, and land sales to Jews.Mandel, Neville, The Arabs and Zionism before World War I, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976. (p. xviii)Porath, Zipporah, Letters from Jerusalem, 1947‚Äì1948, Jerusalem: Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel, 1987 (p. 26) Tel Aviv was founded on land purchased from Bedouins north of Jaffa. This is the 1909 auction of the first lots. The \\"Second Aliyah\\" took place between 1904 and 1914, during which approximately 40,000 Jews immigrated, mostly from Russia and Poland, and some from Yemen. The Second Aliyah immigrants were both primarily idealists, inspired by the revolutionary ideals then sweeping the Russian Empire who sought to create a communal agricultural settlement system in Palestine. They thus founded the kibbutz movement. The first kibbutz, Degania, was founded in 1909. Tel Aviv was founded at that time, though its founders were not necessarily from the new immigrants. The Second Aliyah is largely credited with the revival of the Hebrew language and establishing it as the standard language for Jews in Israel. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda contributed to the creation of the first modern Hebrew dictionary. Although he was an immigrant of the First Aliyah, his work mostly bore fruit during the second. Ottoman rule over the eastern Mediterranean lasted until World War I when the Ottomans sided with the German Empire and the Central Powers. During World War I, the Ottomans were driven from much of the region by the British Empire during the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Modern eraBritish Mandate period= Zones of French and British influence and control proposed in the Sykes-Picot Agreement Palestine in British map 1924 the map now in the National Library of Scotland Salmond and Sir Wyndham Deedes, 1920. In World War I, the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany. As a result, it was embroiled in a conflict with the United Kingdom. Under the secret Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement of 1916, it was envisioned that most of Palestine, when freed from Ottoman control, would become an international zone not under direct French or British colonial control. Shortly thereafter, British foreign minister Arthur Balfour issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which promised to establish a \\"Jewish national home\\" in Palestine but appeared to contradict the 1915‚Äì16 Hussein- McMahon Correspondence, which contained an undertaking to form a united Arab state in exchange for the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. McMahon's promises could have been seen by Arab nationalists as a pledge of immediate Arab independence, an undertaking violated by the region's subsequent partition into British and French League of Nations mandates under the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of May 1916, which became the real cornerstone of the geopolitics structuring the entire region. The Balfour Declaration, likewise, was seen by Jewish nationalists as the cornerstone of a future Jewish homeland. The British-led Egyptian Expeditionary Force, commanded by Edmund Allenby, captured Jerusalem on 9 December 1917 and occupied the whole of the Levant following the defeat of Turkish forces in Palestine at the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918 and the capitulation of Turkey on 31 October.Hughes, 1999, p. 17; p. 97.See also Third Battle of Gaza and Battle of Beersheba Allenby famously dismounted from his horse when he entered Jerusalem as a mark of respect for the Holy City and was greeted by the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic leaders of the city. Following the First World War and the occupation of the region by the British, the principal Allied and associated powers drafted the mandate, which was formally approved by the League of Nations in 1922. Great Britain administered Palestine on behalf of the League of Nations between 1920 and 1948, a period referred to as the \\"British Mandate\\". The preamble of the mandate declared: > \\"Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory > should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally > made on November 2nd, 1917, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and > adopted by the said Powers, in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a > national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that > nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights > of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political > status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\\" Not all were satisfied with the mandate. The League of Nations' objective with the mandate system was to administer the parts of the former Ottoman Empire, which the Middle East had controlled since the 16th century, \\"until such time as they are able to stand alone\\".Article 22, The Covenant of the League of Nations and \\"Mandate for Palestine\\", Encyclopedia Judaica, Vol. 11, p. 862, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972 Some of the Arabs felt that Britain was violating the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence and the understanding of the Arab Revolt. Some wanted unification with Syria: in February 1919, several Muslim and Christian groups from Jaffa and Jerusalem met and adopted a platform endorsing unity with Syria and opposition to Zionism (this is sometimes called the First Palestinian National Congress). A letter was sent to Damascus authorizing Faisal to represent the Arabs of Palestine at the Paris Peace Conference. In May 1919 a Syrian National Congress was held in Damascus, and a Palestinian delegation attended its sessions.see A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, By Mark A. Tessler, Indiana University Press, 1994, , pp. 155‚Äì156 The 1922 census of Palestine recorded the population of Palestine as 757,000, of which 78% were Muslims, 11% were Jews, 10% were Christians and 1% were Druze. In the early years of the Mandate, Jewish immigration to Palestine was quite substantial. In April 1920, violent Arab disturbances against the Jews in Jerusalem occurred, which came to be known as the 1920 Palestine riots. The riots followed rising tensions in Arab- Jewish relations over the implications of Zionist immigration. The British military administration's erratic response failed to contain the rioting, which continued for four days. As a result of the events, trust among the British, Jews, and Arabs eroded. One consequence was that the Jewish community increased moves towards an autonomous infrastructure and security apparatus parallel to that of the British administration. In April 1920, the Allied Supreme Council (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) met at Sanremo and formal decisions were taken on the allocation of mandate territories. The United Kingdom obtained a mandate for Palestine and France obtained a mandate for Syria. The boundaries of the mandates and the conditions under which they were to be held were not decided. The Zionist Organization's representative at Sanremo, Chaim Weizmann, subsequently reported to his colleagues in London: > There are still important details outstanding, such as the actual terms of > the mandate and the question of the boundaries in Palestine. There is the > delimitation of the boundary between French Syria and Palestine, which will > constitute the northern frontier and the eastern line of demarcation, > adjoining Arab Syria. The latter is not likely to be fixed until the Emir > Feisal attends the Peace Conference, probably in Paris.'Zionist Aspirations: > Dr Weizmann on the Future of Palestine', The Times, Saturday, 8 May 1920; p. > 15. Churchill and Abdullah (with Herbert Samuel) during their negotiations in Jerusalem, March 1921 In July 1920, the French drove Faisal bin Husayn from Damascus, ending his already negligible control over the region of Transjordan, where local chiefs traditionally resisted any central authority. The sheikhs, who had earlier pledged their loyalty to the Sharif of Mecca, asked the British to undertake the region's administration. Herbert Samuel asked for the extension of the Palestine government's authority to Transjordan, but at meetings in Cairo and Jerusalem between Winston Churchill and Emir Abdullah in March 1921 it was agreed that Abdullah would administer the territory (initially for six months only) on behalf of the Palestine administration. In the summer of 1921 Transjordan was included within the Mandate, but excluded from the provisions for a Jewish National Home.Gelber, 1997, pp. 6‚Äì15. On 24 July 1922, the League of Nations approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine and Transjordan. On 16 September the League formally approved a memorandum from Lord Balfour confirming the exemption of Transjordan from the clauses of the mandate concerning the creation of a Jewish national home and Jewish settlement.Sicker, 1999, p. 164. With Transjordan coming under the administration of the British Mandate, the mandate's collective territory became constituted of 23% Palestine and 77% Transjordan. The mandate for Palestine, while specifying actions in support of Jewish immigration and political status, stated, in Article 25, that in the territory to the east of the Jordan River, Britain could 'postpone or withhold' those articles of the Mandate concerning a Jewish National Home. Transjordan was a very sparsely populated region (especially in comparison with Palestine proper) due to its relatively limited resources and largely desert environment.Boundaries Delimitation: Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Yitzhak Gil-Har, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1 (January, 2000), pp. 68‚Äì81See Marjorie M.

The British handed over the southern Golan Heights to the French in return for the northern Jordan Valley. The border was re-drawn so that both sides of the Jordan River and the whole of the Sea of Galilee, including a 10-metre-wide strip along the northeastern shore, were made a part of Palestine, with the provisions that Syria have fishing and navigation rights in the lake.No. 565. ‚Äî Exchange of Notes * Constituting an Agreement Between the British and French Governments Respecting the Boundary Line Between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hamm√©, Paris March 7, 1923, p. 7 Border Treaty The Palestine Exploration Fund published surveys and maps of Western Palestine (aka Cisjordan) starting in the mid-19th century. Even before the Mandate came into legal effect in 1923, British terminology sometimes used '\\"Palestine\\" for the part west of the Jordan River and \\"Trans-Jordan\\" (or Transjordania) for the part east of the Jordan River.Ingrams, 1972 Rachel's Tomb on a 1927 British Mandate stamp. \\"Palestine\\" is shown in English, Arabic (), and Hebrew, the latter includes the acronym for The first reference to the Palestinians, without qualifying them as Arabs, is to be found in a document of the Permanent Executive Committee, composed of Muslims and Christians, presenting a series of formal complaints to the British authorities on 26 July 1928.Henry Laurens, , Fayard, Paris 2002 vol.2 p. 101 Infrastructure and development Between 1922 and 1947, the annual growth rate of the Jewish sector of the economy was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5%. Per capita, these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively. By 1936, the Jewish sector had eclipsed the Arab one, and Jewish individuals earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs. In terms of human capital, there was a huge difference. For instance, the literacy rates in 1932 were 86% for the Jews against 22% for the Arabs, although Arab literacy was steadily increasing.Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood, 2006. Beacon Press. . In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, and the Haavara agreement between the Zionist Federation and the Third Reich was to facilitate the emigration of German Jews. Immigration dramatically increased during the mid-1930s. The office of \\"Mufti of Jerusalem\\", traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned by the British into that of \\"Grand Mufti of Palestine\\". Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties, such as the administration of religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis. During the revolt (see below) the Arab Higher Committee was established as the central political organ of the Arab community of Palestine. During the Mandate period, many factories were established and roads and railroads were built throughout the country. The Jordan River was harnessed for production of electric power and the Dead Sea was tapped for minerals‚Äîpotash and bromine. 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine British soldiers frisk a Palestinian man in Jerusalem in the late 1930s, photo by Khalil Raad. Sparked off by the death of Shaykh Izz ad- Din al-Qassam at the hands of the British police near Jenin in November 1935, between 1936‚Äì1939 the Arabs participated in the Great Uprising to protest against British rule and mass Jewish immigration. The revolt manifested in a strike and armed insurrection started sporadically, becoming more organized with time. Attacks were mainly directed at British strategic installations such as the Trans Arabian Pipeline (TAP) and railways, and to a lesser extent against Jewish settlements, secluded Jewish neighbourhoods in the mixed cities, and Jews, both individually and in groups. Violence abated for about a year while the Peel Commission deliberated and eventually recommended partition of Palestine. With the Arab rejection of this proposal, the revolt resumed during the autumn of 1937. Violence continued throughout 1938 and eventually petered out in 1939. The British responded to the violence by greatly expanding their military forces and clamping down on Arab dissent. \\"Administrative detention\\" (imprisonment without charges or trial), curfews, and house demolitions were among British practices during this period. More than 120 Arabs were sentenced to death and about 40 hanged. The main Arab leaders were arrested or expelled. The Haganah (Hebrew for \\"defense\\"), a Jewish paramilitary organization, actively supported British efforts to quell the insurgency, which reached 10,000 Arab fighters at their peak during the summer and fall of 1938. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the Jewish Settlement Police and Special Night Squads.see see Uniform and History of the Palestine Police A splinter group of the Haganah, called the Irgun (or Etzel)Etzel ‚Äì The Establishment of Irgun. adopted a policy of violent retaliation against Arabs for attacks on Jews; the Hagana has adopted a policy of restraint. In a meeting in Alexandria in July 1937 between Irgun founder Ze‚Äôev Jabotinsky, commander Col. Robert Bitker and chief-of-staff Moshe Rosenberg, the need for indiscriminate retaliation due to the difficulty of limiting operations to only the \\"guilty\\" was explained. The Irgun launched attacks against public gathering places such as markets and cafes.see for example the incident on 14 March 1937 when Arieh Yitzhaki and Benjamin Zeroni tossed a bomb into the Azur coffee house outside Tel Aviv in Terror Out of Zion, by J. Bowyer Bell, Transaction Publishers, 1996, , pp. 35‚Äì36. The Arab revolt of 1936‚Äì39 in Palestine. A Jewish bus equipped with wire screens to protect civilian riders against rocks and grenades thrown by militants. The revolt did not achieve its goals, although it is \\"credited with signifying the birth of the Arab Palestinian identity\\". It is generally credited with forcing the issuance of the White Paper of 1939, which stated that Britain had created the Jewish national home in Palestine and announced a 10 year timetable for an independent Palestine.1939 White Paper Another outcome of the hostilities was the partial disengagement of the Jewish and Arab economies in Palestine, which were more or less intertwined until that time. For example, whereas the Jewish city of Tel Aviv previously relied on the nearby Arab seaport of Jaffa, hostilities dictated the construction of a separate Jewish-run seaport for Tel Aviv. World War II When the Second World War broke out, the Jewish population sided with Britain. David Ben- Gurion, head of the Jewish Agency, defined the policy with what became a famous motto: \\"We will fight the war as if there were no White Paper, and we will fight the White Paper as if there were no war.\\" While this represented the Jewish population as a whole, there were exceptions (see below). As in most of the Arab world, there was no unanimity among the Palestinian Arabs as to their position regarding the combatants in World War II. A number of leaders and public figures saw an Axis victory as the likely outcome and a way of securing Palestine back from the Zionists and the British. Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, spent the rest of the war in Nazi Germany and the occupied areas. About 6,000 Palestinian Arabs and 30,000 Palestinian Jews joined the British forces. On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the British Commonwealth and sided with Germany. Within a month, the Italians attacked Palestine from the air, bombing Tel Aviv and Haifa. In 1942, there was a period of anxiety for the Yishuv, when the forces of German General Erwin Rommel advanced east in North Africa towards the Suez Canal and there was fear that they would conquer Palestine. This event was the direct cause for the founding, with British support, of the PalmachHow the Palmach was formed (History Central)‚Äîa highly trained regular unit belonging to Haganah (which was mostly made up of reserve troops). Jewish Brigade headquarters under both Union Flag and Jewish flag On 3 July 1944, the British government consented to the establishment of a Jewish Brigade with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers. The brigade fought in Europe, most notably against the Germans in Italy from March 1945 until the end of the war in May 1945. Members of the Brigade played a key role in the Berihah's efforts to help Jews escape Europe for Palestine. Later, veterans of the Jewish Brigade became key participants of the new State of Israel's Israel Defense Forces. Starting in 1939 and throughout the war and the Holocaust, the British reduced the number of Jewish immigrants allowed into Palestine, following the publication of the MacDonald White Paper. Once the 15,000 annual quota was exceeded, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution were placed in detention camps or deported to places such as Mauritius.Karl Lenk, The Mauritius Affair, The Boat People of 1940/41, London 1991 In 1944 Menachem Begin assumed the Irgun's leadership, determined to force the British government to remove its troops entirely from Palestine. Citing that the British had reneged on their original promise of the Balfour Declaration, and that the White Paper of 1939 restricting Jewish immigration was an escalation of their pro-Arab policy, he decided to break with the Haganah. Soon after he assumed command, a formal 'Declaration of Revolt' was publicized, and armed attacks against British forces were initiated. Lehi, another splinter group, opposed cessation of operations against the British authorities all along. The Jewish Agency, which opposed those actions and the challenge to its role as government in preparation responded with \\"The Hunting Season\\"‚Äîsevere actions against supporters of the Irgun and Lehi, including turning them over to the British‚Äù. The country developed economically during the war, with increased industrial and agricultural outputs and the period was considered an \`economic Boom'. In terms of Arab-Jewish relations, these were relatively quiet times.James L. Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine conflict, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 120. End of the British Mandate 1945‚Äì1948 JNF and PICA Arab autobus after an attack by Irgun, 29 December 1947 In the years following World War II, Britain's control over Palestine became increasingly tenuous. This was caused by a combination of factors, including: * World public opinion turned against Britain as a result of the British policy of preventing Holocaust survivors from reaching Palestine, sending them instead to Cyprus internment camps, or even back to Germany, as in the case of Exodus in 1947. * The costs of maintaining an army of over 100,000 men in Palestine weighed heavily on a British economy suffering from post-war depression, and was another cause for British public opinion to demand an end to the Mandate.The Rise and fall of the British Empire, By Lawrence James, Macmillan, 1997, , p. 562 * Rapid deterioration due to the actions of the Jewish paramilitary organizations (Hagana, Irgun and Lehi), involving attacks on strategic installations (by all three) as well as on British forces and officials (by the Irgun and Lehi). This caused severe damage to British morale and prestige, as well as increasing opposition to the mandate in Britain itself, public opinion demanding to \\"bring the boys home\\". * The U.S. Congress was delaying a loan necessary to prevent British bankruptcy. The delays were in response to the British refusal to fulfill a promise given to Truman that 100,000 Holocaust survivors would be allowed to emigrate to Palestine. In early 1947 the British Government announced their desire to terminate the Mandate, and asked the United Nations General Assembly to make recommendations regarding the future of the country.see Request for a Special Session of the General Assembly on Palestine The British Administration declined to accept the responsibility for implementing any solution that wasn't acceptable to both the Jewish and the Arab communities, or to allow other authorities to take over responsibility for public security prior to the termination of its mandate on 15 May 1948.see Rabbi Silver's request regarding the formation of a Jewish militia and the dissolution of the mandate in S/PV.262, Minutes 262nd Meeting of the UN Security Council,5 March 1948 UN partition and the 1948 Palestine War UN partition plan, 1947 On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly, voting 33 to 13 in favour with 10 abstentions, adopted Resolution 181 (II) (though not legally binding) recommending a partition with the Economic Union of Mandatory Palestine to follow the termination of the British Mandate. The plan was to partition Palestine into an \\"Independent Arab state alongside a Jewish States, and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem\\".UNITED NATIONS General Assembly: A/RES/181(II): 29 November 1947: Resolution 181 (II): Future government of Palestine: Retrieved 26 April 2012 Jerusalem was to encompass Bethlehem. Zionist leaders (including the Jewish Agency), accepted the plan, while Palestinian Arab leaders rejected it and all independent Muslim and Arab states voted against it.6 Arab states, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen: 4 Moslem states, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey: Greece, Cuba and India also voted against. See Henry Cattan, The Palestine question, Routledge, London 1988 p. 36 Almost immediately, sectarian violence erupted and spread, killing hundreds of Arabs, Jews and British over the ensuing months. The UN resolution was the catalyst for a full scale civil war. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating.Benny Morris, 1948. A History of the First Arab- Israeli War, Yale University Press, 2008, p.79. Arab volunteers of the Arab Liberation Army entered Palestine to fight alongside the Palestinians, but the April‚ÄìMay offensive of Yishuv forces defeated the Arab forces and Arab Palestinian society collapsed. By the time the armistice was signed, some 700,000 Palestinians caught up in the turmoil fled or were driven from their homes. David Ben-Gurion proclaiming independence beneath a large portrait of Theodor Herzl, founder of modern Zionism On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish People's Council declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel (The Land of Israel), to be known as the State of Israel.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948: Retrieved 26 April 2012 The neighbouring Arab states intervened to prevent the partition and support the Palestinian Arab population. While Transjordan and Egypt took control of territory designated for the future Arab State, Syrian and Iraqi expeditionary forces attacked Israel without success. The most intensive battles were waged between the Jordanian and Israeli forces over the control of Jerusalem. On June 11, a truce was accepted by all parties. Israel used the lull to undertake a large-scale reinforcement of its army. In a series of military operations, during the war it conquered the whole of the Galilee region, both the Lydda and Ramle areas, and the Negev. It also managed to secure, in the Battles of Latrun, a road linking Jerusalem to Israel. However, the neighboring Arab countries signed the 1949 Armistice Agreements that ended the war, and have recognized de facto the new borders of Israel. In this phase, 350,000 more Arab Palestinians fled or were expelled from the conquered areas. =Partition of former Mandatory territory= The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan while the Jews ostensibly accepted it. Following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the area allocated to the Palestinian Arabs and the international zone of Jerusalem were occupied by Israel and the neighboring Arab states in accordance with the terms of the 1949 Armistice Agreements. In addition to the UN-partitioned area allotted to the Jewish state, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the British Mandate territory. Jordan retained possession of about 21% of the former Mandate territory. Jerusalem was divided, with Jordan taking the eastern parts, including the Old City, and Israel taking the western parts. In addition, Syria held on to small slivers of the former Mandate territory to the south and east of the Sea of Galilee, which had been allocated in the UN partition plan to the Jewish state. For a description of the massive population movements, Arab and Jewish, at the time of the 1948 war and over the following decades, see Palestinian exodus and Jewish exodus from Arab lands. Palestinian governorship in Egyptian-controlled Gaza On the same day that the State of Israel was announced, the Arab League announced that it would set up a single Arab civil administration throughout Palestine.see The Middle East Journal, Middle East Institute (Washington, D.C.), 1949, p. 78, October 1): Robert A. Lovett, Acting Secretary of State, announced the U.S. would not recognize the new Arab Government in Palestine, and Foreign relations of the United States, 1948. The Near East, South Asia, and Africa, Volume V, Part 2, p. 1448 The All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948, during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. It was soon recognized by all Arab League members, except Jordan. Though jurisdiction of the Government was declared to cover the whole of the former Mandatory Palestine, its effective jurisdiction was limited to the Gaza Strip. The Prime Minister of the Gaza-seated administration was named Ahmed Hilmi Pasha, and the President was named Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former chairman of the Arab Higher Committee. The All-Palestine Government is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state. It was under official Egyptian protection, but, on the other hand, it had no executive role, but rather mostly political and symbolic. Its importance gradually declined, especially due to relocation of seat of government from Gaza to Cairo following Israeli incursions in late 1948. Though Gaza Strip returned under Egyptian control later on through the war, the All-Palestine Government remained in-exile in Cairo, managing Gazan affairs from outside. In 1959, the All-Palestine Government was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, coming under formal Egyptian military administration, with the appointment of Egyptian military administrators in Gaza. Egypt, however, both formally and informally denounced any and all territorial claims to Palestinian territory, in contrast to the government of Transjordan, which declared its annexation of the Palestinian West Bank. The All-Palestine Government's credentials as a bona fide sovereign state were questioned by many, particularly due to the effective reliance upon not only Egyptian military support, but Egyptian political and economic power. Annexation of the West Bank of Jordan Shortly after the proclamation of All-Palestine Government in Gaza, the Jericho Conference named King Abdullah I of Transjordan, \\"King of Arab Palestine\\".See Jericho Declaration, Palestine Post, December 14, 1948, Front page The Congress called for the union of Arab Palestine and Transjordan and Abdullah announced his intention to annex the West Bank. The other Arab League member states opposed Abdullah's plan. The New Historians, like Avi Shlaim, hold that there was an unwritten secret agreement between King Abdullah of Transjordan and Israeli authorities to partition the territory between themselves, and that this translated into each side limiting their objectives and exercising mutual restraint during the 1948 war.Avi Shlaim in Pappe's The Israel/Palestine question, p. 187. The presence of a large number of immigrants and refugees from the now dissolved Mandate of Palestine fueled the regional ambitions of King Abdullah I, who sought control over what had been the British Jerusalem and Samaria districts on the west bank of Jordan River. Towards this goal the king granted Jordanian citizenship to all Arab holders of the Palestinian Mandate identity documents in February 1949, and outlawed the terms \\"Palestinian\\" and \\"Transjordanian\\" from official usage, changing the country's name from the Emirate of Trans-Jordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.Carroll, K. B., Business As Usual?: Economic Reform in Jordan, Lexington Books, 2003, p.108 The area east of the river became known as \\"al- ·∏åiffah al-Sharqiyyal\\", or \\"The East Bank\\". In April 1950, with the formal annexation of the positions held by the Jordanian Army since 1948, the area became known as \\"al-·∏åiffah al-Gharbiyyal\\" or \\"The Western Bank\\".Lutfiyya, A. M., Baytin: A Jordanian Village. A Study of Social Institutions and Social Change in a Folk Community, Walter de Gruyter, 1966, pp.13‚Äì14 With the formal union of the East and West Banks in 1950, the number of Palestinians in the kingdom rose by another 720,000, of whom 440,000 were West Bank residents and 280,000 were refugees from other areas of the former Mandate then living on the West Bank. Palestinians became the majority in Jordan although most believed their return to what was now the state of Israel was imminent.Carroll, p.108 =Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War= The region today: Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights In the course of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of the area that had been part of the British Mandate of Palestine, taking the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Following military threats by Egypt and Syria, including Egyptian president Nasser's demand of the UN to remove its peace-keeping troops from the Egyptian-Israeli border, in June 1967 Israeli forces went to action against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. As a result of that war, the Israel Defense Forces conquered the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula bringing them under military rule. Israel also pushed Arab forces back from East Jerusalem, which Jews had not been permitted to visit during the prior Jordanian rule. East Jerusalem was allegedlyIan Lustick, Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem? annexed by Israel as part of its capital, though this action has not been recognized internationally. Israel also started building settlements on the occupied land.Ian J. Bickerton 2009, The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli Conflict: A History. Reaktion Books Ltd, , p. 106. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, promoting the \\"land for peace\\" formula, which called for Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967, in return for the end of all states of belligerency by the aforementioned Arab League nations. Palestinians continued longstanding demands for the destruction of Israel or made a new demand for self-determination in a separate independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip similar to but smaller than the original Partition area that Palestinians and the Arab League had rejected for statehood in 1947. In the course of 1973 Yom Kippur War, military forces of Egypt crossed the Suez canal and Syria to regain the Golan heights. The attacking military forces of Syria were pushed back. After a cease fire, Egyptian President Sadat Anwar Sadat started peace talks with the U.S. and Israel. Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt as part of the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt and Israel. =First Intifada, Oslo Accords and Palestinian Authority= From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place. Attempts at the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process were made at the Madrid Conference of 1991. Following the historic 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israel (the \\"Oslo Accords\\"), which gave the Palestinians limited self-rule in some parts of the occupied territoriesIsrael and the Palestinians: Key terms, BBC through the Palestinian Authority, and other detailed negotiations, proposals for a Palestinian state gained momentum. They were soon followed in 1993 by the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty. Second Intifada and later After few years of on-and-off negotiations, the Palestinians began an uprising against Israel. This was known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada. The events were highlighted in world media by Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel that killed many civilians, and by Israeli Security Forces full-fledged invasions into civilian areas along with some targeted killings of Palestinian militant leaders and organizers. Israel began building a complex security barrier to block suicide bombers crossing into Israel from the West Bank in 2002. Also in 2002, the Road map for peace calling for the resolution of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict was proposed by a \\"quartet\\": the United States, European Union, Russia, and United Nations. U.S. President George W. Bush in a speech on June 24, 2002, called for an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace. Bush was the first U.S. President to explicitly call for such a Palestinian state. Following Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004, it withdrew all settlers and most of the military presence from the Gaza strip, but maintained control of the air space and coast. Israel also dismantled four settlements in northern West Bank in September 2005. = Gaza-West Bank split = On January 25, 2006 Palestinian legislative elections were held in order to elect the second Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Hamas won the election, securing 74 of the 132 seats while its rival Fatah only won 45 seats. The outcome of the election shocked the world and meant that Hamas would overtake most of PA's institutions. Hamas tried to form a unity government with Fatah, but the offer was rebuffed. Meanwhile, Israel and the US imposed sanctions on the PA in order to destabilize the Palestinian government so that it would fail and new elections would be called. Those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful but lead to a rift between Hamas and Fatah. In June 2006, Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas carried out a cross-border raid from Gaza into Israel through a tunnel dug for the purpose of attacking Israel. An Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, was captured and taken to Gaza by the militants. He would be held for five years until he was released in 2011 in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners imprisoned by Israel. The raid caused Israel to large several large-scale invasions of Gaza in the summer and autumn of 2006 attempting to rescue their captured soldier. Over 500 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed during the hostilities but ultimately they were unsuccessful in retrieving Shalit. Relations between Hamas and Fatah deteriorated further as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attempted to dismiss the Hamas-led coalition government in June 2007. Hamas objected to this move being illegal and street battles between Hamas and Fatah members broke out in what came to be known as the 2007 Battle of Gaza. Hamas emerged victorious and took control of the Gaza Strip. From that point on, governance of the Palestinian territories were split between Hamas and Fatah. Hamas, branded an Islamist terror organization by the EU and several Western countries, in control of Gaza and Fatah in control of the West Bank. As of July 2009, approximately 305,000 Israelis lived in 121 settlements in the West Bank. The 2.4 million West Bank Palestinians (according to Palestinian evaluations) live primarily in four blocs centered in Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, and Jericho. Non-member status of State of Palestine On 23 September 2011, President Mahmoud Abbas on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organisation submitted an application for membership of Palestine in the United Nations. The campaign, dubbed \\"Palestine 194\\", was formally backed by the Arab League in May, and was officially confirmed by the PLO on 26 June. The decision was labelled by the Israeli government as a unilateral step, while the Palestinian government countered that it is essential to overcoming the current impasse. Several other countries, such as Germany and Canada, have also denounced the decision and called for a prompt return to negotiations. Many others, however, such as Norway and Russia, have endorsed the plan, as has Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon, who stated, \\"UN members are entitled whether to vote for or against the Palestinian statehood recognition at the UN.\\" In July 2012, it was reported that Hamas Government in Gaza was considering declaring the independence of the Gaza Strip with the help of Egypt. In August 2012, Foreign Minister of the PNA Riyad al-Malki told reporters in Ramallah that PNA would renew effort to upgrade the Palestinian (PLO) status to \\"full member state\\" at the U.N. General Assembly on September 27, 2012. By September 2012, with their application for full membership stalled due to the inability of Security Council members to \\"make a unanimous recommendation\\", Palestine had decided to pursue an upgrade in status from \\"observer entity\\" to \\"non-member observer state\\". On November 27, it was announced that the appeal had been officially made, and would be put to a vote in the General Assembly on November 29, where their status upgrade was expected to be supported by a majority of states. In addition to granting Palestine \\"non-member observer state status\\", the draft resolution \\"expresses the hope that the Security Council will consider favourably the application submitted on 23 September 2011 by the State of Palestine for admission to full membership in the United Nations, endorses the two state solution based on the pre-1967 borders, and stresses the need for an immediate resumption of negotiations between the two parties\\". On November 29, 2012, in a 138‚Äì9 vote (with 41 abstaining), General Assembly resolution 67/19 passed, upgrading Palestine to \\"non-member observer state\\" status in the United Nations. The new status equates Palestine's with that of the Holy See. The change in status was described by The Independent as \\"de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine\\". The UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as \\"The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations\\", and Palestine has started to re- title its name accordingly on postal stamps, official documents and passports, whilst it has instructed its diplomats to officially represent \\"The State of Palestine\\", as opposed to the \\"Palestine National Authority\\". Additionally, on 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon decided that \\"the designation of 'State of Palestine' shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents\\", thus recognising the PLO-proclaimed State of Palestine as being sovereign over the territories Palestine and its citizens under international law. As of February 2013, 131 (67.9%) of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine. Many of the countries that do not recognise the State of Palestine nevertheless recognise the PLO as the 'representative of the Palestinian people'.

Additionally, it also serves as a way to express gratitude and appreciation of God for the thing possessed, given, or owned by the person. In this sense, the phrase is closely related to another Arabic term, namely, Alhamdulillah, which conveys the idea of \\"All praise be to God,\\" or even, \\"Thank God,\\" as it is most often understood by Muslims and Arabs (both Muslim and non-Muslim Arabs). Although this phrase is generally observed to be used by Arabs (both Muslim and non-Muslim), non-Arab Muslim operators of the phrase also display its usage, especially those closely familiar with the Qur'an and those that possess a relatively simple and basic understanding of the Arabic language, given that the phrase is extracted from the Qur'an.  History of the phrase  This phrase comes from a verse of the Holy Qur'an in which it forms only a small part of the entire verse.

There have also been several recent attempts to form professional cricket leagues in the United States. History The Belmont Cricket Club in 1905.Cricket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century. Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. A New York newspaper from 1739 contains an advertisement for cricket players and the first documented competition occurred in 1751 in Manhattan. According to William Byrd II's diary, cricket was played on the slave plantations of Virginia, including on his Westover estate among neighbors and slaves. By 1793, Dartmouth College students were playing cricket on the Green. Philadelphia was the crucible of North American cricket and remains so today. Haverford College formed a cricket team in 1833, generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans. Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played in 1864, believed to be the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America, after the 1852 Harvard-Yale crew and 1859 Amherst-Williams baseball matches. An Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed from 1881‚Äì1924. The eleven-person team cricket familiar with Americans today took root most effectively at the St. George's Cricket Club, founded in 1838. Clubs from the United States (St. George's CC) and Canada participated in one of the first international cricket matches on record in 1844 in Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan. Cricket received a significant amount of media coverage at the time. In the mid-19th century, the sport was played in approximately 125 cities in 22 states. Roughly 500 officially established clubs existed and it is probable that in 1860 there were 10,000 boys and men in America who had actively played the sport for at least a season. St. George's CC employed Sheffield native Samuel Wright as its professional cricket playing groundsman. Wright's two sons, Harry and George, played for the United States XXII against the All England XI in 1859 in New York and Philadelphia. Both Wright brothers became renowned in baseball circles after they played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, America's first professional baseball team. English cricket teams toured American regularly. Richard Daft's England side visited in 1869, when they played in New York and Philadelphia. Then with the spread of cricket to Boston, Lord Hawke's England XI played George Wright's New England Cricket XI at the Longwood Country Club in Boston. On the same tour in 1891 Lord Hawke's XI defeated a Germantown CC XI in Philadelphia, which included George Patterson, regarded as America's best batsman, with several centuries to his credit. George Patterson ‚Äì referred to as America's W.G. Grace ‚Äì was an American-born cricketer and lawyer by profession, described as brilliant under pressure when facing first- class English sides. In 2004 Pro Cricket was organized as a professional Twenty20 format league with eight teams in two divisions. However, the league closed at the end of its first season in 2004. The Pro Cricket league was independent of the USACA and not recognized or sanctioned by it. Among post- secondary institutions, in recent years Haverford College is one of the few to field a cricket team at the varsity level. Organization of cricket in the United StatesInternational cricket= International Cricket in America was virtually nonexistent until recently when the United States national cricket team started playing in the World Cricket League. Cricket in the United States was previously run by the United States of America Cricket Association, whose effectiveness was lessened by limited funds due to cricket's lack of popularity compared to other sports. It is now run by USA Cricket. The United States cricket team is currently unranked in Test Cricket and One Day International cricket. =Domestic competitions= * National Cricket League (NCL) - NCL successfully staged the historical event first-time State-vs-state T20 National Cricket Championship in the United States at Milwaukee during July 4‚Äì7, 2019. Teams from eight different states (FL, GA, IL, MI, MN, PA, TX, and WI) participated in the Tournament. Atlanta Fire bagged the Championship by beating Michigan Stars. Several international and US national cricket team players played in the Tournament, too. By all accounts, the Tournament was a runaway success. NCL has announced to host the 2nd NCL Tournament during July 2‚Äì5, 2020 in Milwaukee, WI. *Amateur City Leagues - Many of the biggest cities in the United States, such as Detroit, have their own amateur cricket league. One of the biggest leagues is the Detroit Cricket League with 30 different teams playing in metropolitan Detroit. * Pro Cricket ‚Äì The first professional cricket league in the United States. It was operated by American Pro Cricket LLC (APC), a private company independent of the ICC and the USACA. The league was formed in 2004 as one of several independent efforts by different organizations to develop and promote cricket in the United States. The league folded after one season due to low attendance and the cancellation of the league's TV deal. * American Twenty20 Championship ‚Äì Twenty20 cricket tournament aimed at grooming American cricket players for international events and to spread interest in the U.S. Its first and only season was a three-day event in 2011, consisting of a tournament played in New Jersey, which was won by the Atlantic Division. The tournament was supported by the United States of America Cricket Association, the national federation of cricket in the US. * Major League Cricket - Organization that intended to form a Twenty20 league in 2007 and host an under-15 tournament in 2005, but neither were realized. The organization hosted a National Interstate Cricket Cup tournament in Florida in 2005. MLC began in 2000 and attempted rival the USACA during the U.S. cricketing tumult of 2004-2006. * American Premier League - Twenty20 league that never got off the ground in 2009. * TANA Premier League - The Telugu Association of North America, or TANA, administers a cricket tournament across the United States, the most recent being in that of May 2015 in Detroit, Michigan. In July 2015, several actors and actresses from the Telugu film industry, or Tollywood, will be journeying to Detroit to play against the champions of the TANA Premier League Cup. *NECA League New England Cricket Association Inc. (NECA) is a \\"not for profit\\" sports organization dedicated to promote Hard Tennis Ball T20 Cricket in Boston's Metro West area. NECA provides the framework for teams interested in playing friendly and organized Hard Tennis Ball Cricket. NECA has operated as a friendly social organization of Cricket lovers since 2003 and was officially incorporated in 2018 in the Common Wealth of Massachusetts. NECA is run on a purely volunteer basis and is governed by the board of elected senior members. Since its inception in 2003, NECA has grown from just a few teams to 32 teams across three divisions in 2017, and continues to grow in size with the interest for Cricket in the rise in New England. Cricket grounds Students playing cricket at Dartmouth College in 1793 There are only a few purpose-built cricket grounds in the United States, they include the Germantown Cricket Club Ground and the Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Randolph St. George Walker Park on Staten Island, New York; the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida; and the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Van Nuys, California. The Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, which features cricket grounds, was completed in 2014, and hosted the USACA's national championship that year. The game is also played on a number of shared purpose venues, they include Van Cortlandt Stadium in Bronx, New York and others. The main cricket grounds in the USA include: * Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill - Hosted 4 T20I since 2010. It is the only ICC-certified cricket stadium in The United States. * Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Los Angeles - Hosted five List-A match between India-A and Australia-A in 1999 * Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis - The facility is slated to open in 2014 and hosted the domestic season in 2014 and 2015 * Germantown Cricket Club Ground - Hosted few First- class matches * Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground - Hosted few First-class matches * Randolph St. George Walker Park Governing body The United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) is the former governing body for International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned cricket in the United States. The ICC recognized the USACA as an associate member starting in 1965. In 2005 the USACA was suspended from an ICC sponsored annual conference due to problems with USACA elections, but that suspension was lifted in March 2006. In 2007 the USACA was again suspended by the ICC because of problems with its administration and constitution, but was again recognized beginning on April 1, 2008. It was again suspended in 2015. The national association organizes play within and between seven regional conferences, which may contain several leagues. A league is a group of 8 or more teams that play according to a schedule. Competition is held at various age levels including under-19, under-15, senior, etc. The USACA holds a National Senior Tournament as well as national and international competitions for other age groups. USACA was expelled in late 2017 and replaced by USA Cricket as the governing body of ICC-sanctioned cricket in the United States. Cricket in American culture A Sri Lankan-American child playing cricket in the US state of Virginia. In 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually. By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams. Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations. There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat and ball sport now called baseball, which seems to have displaced cricket as a popular pastime. Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the Imperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the US from participating in the sport at the highest level. Nevertheless, in 1965 the US was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the US who come from cricket playing nations. With the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket's fan base beyond expatriates and their children. ESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket. Today, cricket in the United States is mostly played by those with heritage in countries where cricket is popular, such as Indian Americans among others. Despite its lack of popularity, it is not uncommon to find clubs with a long history and a lineage dating back to the early 20th century.

The 7th place in the championship was achieved with the coacher's good performances and with the notables gamas: wan against FC Porto and Sporting CP, both at Est√°dio do Bessa. The good work of Henrique Calisto can also be seen in the valorization of players: Jorge Silva scored 11 goals and moved to Benfica. After only a few months in charge of S.C.

There have been several programs which have attempted to institute this methodology; however, there has been limited application of entomological warfare against military or civilian targets, Japan being the only state known to have verifiably implemented the method against another state, namely the Chinese during World War 2. However, EW was used more widely in antiquity, in order to repel sieges or cause economic harm to states. Research into EW was conducted during both the Cold war and World War 2 by numerous states such as the Soviet Union, United States, Germany and Canada. There have also been suggestions that it could be implemented by non- state actors in a form of bioterrorism. Under the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention of 1972, use of insects to administer agents or toxins for hostile purposes is deemed to be against international law. Description EW is a specific type of biological warfare (BW) that uses insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a biological agent, such as plague or cholera. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing the insects over target areas.\\"An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety \\", The Sunshine Project, April 2002, accessed December 25, 2008. The insects then act as a vector, infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method of entomological warfare is to use uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy.Lockwood, Jeffrey A. Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War, Oxford University Press, USA, 2008, pp. 9‚Äì26, (). Early history Entomological warfare is not a new concept; historians and writers have studied EW in connection to multiple historic events. A 14th century plague epidemic in Asia Minor that eventually became known as the Black Death (carried by fleas) is one such event that has drawn attention from historians as a possible early incident of entomological warfare. That plague's spread over Europe may have been the result of a biological attack on the Crimean city of Kaffa.Kirby, Reid. \\"Using the flea as weapon\\", (Web version via findarticles.com), Army Chemical Review, July 2005, accessed December 23, 2008. According to Jeffrey Lockwood, author of Six- Legged Soldiers (a book about EW), the earliest incident of entomological warfare was probably the use of bees by early humans.Baumann, Peter. \\"Warfare gets the creepy-crawlies\\", Laramie Boomerang, October 18, 2008, accessed December 23, 2008. The bees or their nests were thrown into caves to force the enemy out and into the open. Lockwood theorizes that the Ark of the Covenant may have been deadly when opened because it contained deadly fleas.\\"UW Professor Examines Biological Setting of Egyptian Plagues\\", (Press release), University of Wyoming, December 12, 2005, accessed December 23, 2008. During the American Civil War the Confederacy accused the Union of purposely introducing the harlequin bug in the South. These accusations were never proven, and modern research has shown it more likely that the insect arrived by other means. The world did not experience large-scale entomological warfare until World War II; Japanese attacks in China were the only verified instance of BW or EW during the war.Peterson, R.K.D. \\"The Role of Insects as a Biological Weapon\\" , Department of Entomology, Montana State University, notes based on seminar, 1990, accessed December 25, 2008. During, and following, the war other nations began their own EW programs. World War II The Colorado potato beetle was considered as an EW weapon by nations on both sides of WWII =France= France is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II. Like Germany, the nation suggested that the Colorado potato beetle, aimed at the enemy's food sources, would be an asset during the war.Lockwood, Jeffrey A. \\"Bug Bomb\\", Boston Globe, October 21, 2007, accessed December 23, 2008. As early as 1939 biological warfare experts in France suggested that the beetle be used against German crops. =Germany= Germany is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II. The nation pursued the mass-production, and dispersion, of the Colorado potato beetle (Lepinotarsa decemlineata), aimed at the enemy's food sources. The beetle was first found in Germany in 1914, as an invasive species from North America. There are no records that indicate the beetle was ever employed as a weapon by Germany, or any other nation during the war.Heather, Neil W. and Hallman, Guy J. Pest Management and Phytosanitary Trade Barriers ([Google Books]), CABI, 2008, pp. 17‚Äì18, (). Regardless, the Germans had developed plans to drop the beetles on English crops. Germany carried out testing of its Colorado potato beetle weaponization program south of Frankfurt, where they released 54,000 of the beetles. In 1944, an infestation of Colorado potato beetles was reported in Germany. The source of the infestation is unknown, speculation has offered three alternative theories as to the origin of the infestation. One option is Allied action, an entomological attack, another is that it was the result of the German testing, and still another more likely explanation is that it was merely a natural occurrence. =Canada= Among the Allied Powers, Canada led the pioneering effort in vector-borne warfare. After Japan became intent on developing the plague flea as a weapon, Canada and the United States followed suit. Cooperating closely with the United States, Dr. G.B. Reed, chief of Kingston's Queen's University's Defense Research Laboratory, focused his research efforts on mosquito vectors, biting flies, and plague infected fleas during World War II. Much of this research was shared with or conducted in concert with the United States. Canada's entire bio-weapons program was ahead of the British and the Americans during the war. The Canadians tended to work in areas their allies ignored; entomological warfare was one of these areas. As the U.S. and British programs evolved, the Canadians worked closely with both nations. The Canadian BW work would continue well after the war,Wheelis, Mark, et al. Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2006, pp. 84-90, (). including entomological research. =Japan= Philadelphia Department of Health poster warning the public of housefly hazards (c. 1942) Japan used entomological warfare on a large scale during World War II in China. Unit 731, Japan's biological warfare unit, led by Lt. General Shir≈ç Ishii, used plague- infected fleas and flies covered with cholera to infect the population in China. Japanese Yagi bombs developed at Pingfan consisted of two compartments, one with houseflies and another with a bacterial slurry that coated the houseflies prior to release. The Japanese military dispersed them from low- flying airplanes; spraying the fleas from them and dropping the Yagi bombs filled with a mixture of insects and disease. Localized and deadly epidemics resulted and nearly 500,000 Chinese died of disease.Lockwood, Jeffrey A. \\"Six- legged soldiers\\", The Scientist, October 24, 2008, accessed December 23, 2008.Novick, Lloyd and Marr, John S.

An international symposium of historians declared in 2002 that Japanese entomological warfare in China was responsible for the deaths of 440,000. The late Ban Shigeo, a technician at the Japanese Army's 9th Technical Research Institute, left a rare and valuable account of the activities of Noborito Research Institute, which was published in Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu ‚Äì The Truth About the Army Noborito Institute (available only in the Japanese language). Of the Japanese Army's ten numbered institutes, only the 9th Army Technical Research Institute came under the covert operations section of the Army General Staff's Second Bureau (Intelligence). On the sensitive issue of Japanese biological warfare, Ban did not shrink from including an account of his trip to Nanking in 1941 to participate in the testing of poisons on Chinese prisoners. One of his book's contributions is to further tie Noborito to the Japanese Army's infamous Unit 731, which participated in biomedical research. When the war ended, the US Army quietly enlisted certain members of Noborito in its efforts against the communist camp in the early years of the Cold War. The author notes near the end of the book that Ban led the \\"chemical section\\" of a US clandestine unit hidden within Yokosuka naval base during the Korean War, and then worked on unspecified projects inside the United States from 1955 to 1959, before returning to Japan to enter the private sector. Shir≈ç Ishii of Unit 731, having not been charged as a war criminal, also continued his work to consult with American authorities, especially during the height of the Cold War, and died in 1959 of throat cancer.THE ROLE OF INSECTS AS BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS notes for a seminar presented by R.K.D. Peterson in 1990 at the University of Nebraska. Retrieved July 20, 2012: In 1989, a British study of Unit 731 strongly supported the theory of United States-Japanese BW culpability in Korea. Chinese experts insist today that BW weapons created in an American-Japanese collaboration were used in the Korean war. =United Kingdom= A British scientist, J.B.S. Haldane, suggested that Britain and Germany were both vulnerable to entomological attack via the Colorado potato beetle. In 1942 the United States shipped 15,000 Colorado potato beetles to Britain for study as a weapon. Cold WarSoviet Union= The Soviet Union researched, developed and tested an entomological warfare program as a major part of an anti-crop and anti-animal BW program. The Soviets developed techniques for using insects to transmit animal pathogens, such as: foot and mouth disease‚Äîwhich they used ticks to transmit; avian ticks to transmit Chlamydophila psittaci to chickens; and claimed to have developed an automated mass insect breeding facility, capable of outputting millions of parasitic insects per day.Ban, Jonathan. \\"Agricultural Biological Warfare: An Overview \\", The Arena, June 2000, Paper #9, Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute, via Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, accessed December 25, 2008. =United States= The U.S. dropped over 300,000 uninfected mosquitoes on its own population. The United States seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare during the Cold War. The United States military developed plans for an entomological warfare facility, designed to produce 100 million yellow fever- infected mosquitoes per month. A U.S. Army report titled \\"Entomological Warfare Target Analysis\\" listed vulnerable sites within the Soviet Union that the U.S. could attack using entomological vectors. The military also tested the mosquito biting capacity by dropping uninfected mosquitoes over U.S. cities. North Korean and Chinese officials leveled accusations that during the Korean War the United States engaged in biological warfare, including EW, in North Korea. The claim is dated to the period of the war, and has been thoroughly denied by the U.S.Regis, Ed. \\"Wartime Lies?\\", The New York Times, June 27, 1999, accessed December 24, 2008. In 1998, Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman claimed that the accusations were true in their book, The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea.Endicott, Stephen, and Hagerman, Edward. The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea, (Google Books, relevant excerpt), Indiana University Press, 1998, pp. 75-77, (), links accessed December 24, 2008. The book received mixed reviews, some called it \\"bad history\\" and \\"appalling\\", while others praised the case the authors made.\\"Reviews of The United States and Biological Warfare: secrets of the Early Cold War and Korea\\", York University, compiled book review excerpts, accessed December 24, 2008. Other historians have revived the claim in recent decades as well. The same year Endicott and Hagerman's book was published Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents which revealed the North Korean claim was an elaborate disinformation campaign.Auster, Bruce B. \\"Unmasking an Old Lie \\", U.S. News and World Report, November 16, 1998, accessed December 24, 2008. A rat flea, the species used in U.S. EW testing during the 1950s During the 1950s the United States conducted a series of field tests using entomological weapons. Operation Big Itch, in 1954, was designed to test munitions loaded with uninfected fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis).Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 304, (). Big Itch went awry when some of the fleas escaped into the plane and bit all three members of the air crew. In May 1955 over 300,000 uninfected mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) were dropped over parts of the U.S. state of Georgia to determine if the air- dropped mosquitoes could survive to take meals from humans. The mosquito tests were known as Operation Big Buzz. Operation Magic Sword was a 1965 U.S. military operation designed to test the effectiveness of the sea-borne release of insect vectors for biological agents. The U.S. engaged in at least two other EW testing programs, Operation Drop Kick and Operation May Day. A 1981 Army report outlined these tests as well as multiple cost-associated issues that occurred with EW. The report is partially declassified‚Äîsome information is blacked out, including everything concerning \\"Drop Kick\\"‚Äîand included \\"cost per death\\" calculations. The cost per death, according to the report, for a vector-borne biological agent achieving a 50% mortality rate in an attack on a city was $0.29 in 1976 dollars. Such an attack was estimated to result in 625,000 deaths.Rose, William H. \\"An Evaluation of Entomological Warfare as a Potential Danger to the United States and European NATO Nations\\", U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, Dugway Proving Ground, March 1981, via thesmokinggun.com, accessed December 25, 2008. At Kadena Air Force Base, an Entomology Branch of the U.S. Army Preventive Medicine Activity, U.S. Army Medical Center was used to grow \\"medically important\\" arthropods, including many strains of mosquitoes in a study of disease vector efficiency. The program reportedly supported a research program studying taxonomic and ecological data surveys for the Smithsonian Institution.\\" The Smithsonian Institution and The National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council administered special research projects in the Pacific. The Far East Section of the Office of the Foreign Secretary (the NAS Foreign Secretary, not the UK office) administered two such projects which focused \\"on the flora of Okinawa\\" and \\"trapping of airborne insects and arthropods for the study of the natural dispersal of insects and arthropods over the ocean.\\" The motivation for civilian research programs of this nature was questioned when it was learned that such international research was in fact funded by and provided to the U.S. Army as part of the U.S. military's biological warfare research. The United States has also applied entomological warfare research and tactics in non-combat situations. In 1990 the U.S. funded a $6.5 million program designed to research, breed and drop caterpillars.Irwin, M.E. and G.E. Kampmeier. \\"Commercial products, from insects\\", (p. 6). In Resh, V.H. & Carde, R. eds. Encyclopedia of Insects, Academic Press, San Diego, via University of Illinois and Illinois Natural History Survey, accessed December 25, 2008. The caterpillars were to be dropped in Peru on coca fields as part of the American War on Drugs. As recently as 2002 U.S. entomological anti-drug efforts at Fort Detrick were focused on finding an insect vector for a virus that affects the opium poppy. Bioterrorism Clemson University's Regulatory and Public Service Program listed \\"diseases vectored by insects\\" among bioterrorism scenarios considered \\"most likely\\".\\"Regulatory and Public Service Programs‚Äô Strategy for the Prevention Of Bioterrorism in Areas Regulated \\", Regulatory and Public Service Program, Clemson University, 2001, accessed December 25, 2008. Because invasive species are already a problem worldwide one University of Nebraska entomologist considered it likely that the source of any sudden appearance of a new agricultural pest would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine.Corley, Heather. \\"Agricultural Bioterror Threat Requires Vigilance \\", (Press release), Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resource, University of Nebraska, November 12, 2001, accessed December 25, 2008. Lockwood considers insects a more effective means of transmitting biological agents for acts of bioterrorism than the actual agents. In his opinion insect vectors are easily gathered and their eggs easily transportable without detection. Isolating and delivering biological agents, on the other hand, is extremely challenging and hazardous.Lockwood, Jeffrey A. \\"Insects: Tougher than anthrax\\", The Boston Globe, October 21, 2007, accessed December 25, 2008. In one of the few suspected acts of entomological bioterrorism an eco-terror group known as The Breeders claimed to have released Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) amidst an ongoing California infestation.Bonfante, Jordan. \\"Medfly Madness\\", Time Magazine, January 8, 1990, accessed December 25, 2008. Lockwood asserts that there is some evidence the group played a role in the event.Baker, Eric. \\"'Maggot bombs' and malaria\\", Casper Star-Tribune, via the Laramie Boomerang, February 27, 2006, accessed December 25, 2008. The pest attacks a variety of crops and the state of California responded with a large- scale pesticide spraying program. At least one source asserted that there is no doubt that an outside hand played a role in the dense 1989 infestation.Howard, Russell D. et al. Homeland Security and Terrorism: Readings and Interpretations, (Google Books), McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 49, (). The group stated in a letter to then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that their goals were twofold. They sought to cause the medfly infestation to grow out of control which, in turn, would render the ongoing malathion spraying program financially infeasible. Legal status The Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972 does not specifically mention insect vectors in its text. The language of the treaty, however, does cover vectors. Article I bans \\"Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\\"\\"Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction\\", The Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention Website, accessed January 5, 2009. It would appear, due to the text of the BWC, that insect vectors as an aspect of entomological warfare are covered and outlawed by the Convention.Zanders, Jean Pascal. \\"Research Policies, BW Development & Disarmament \\", Conference: \\"Ethical Implications of Scientific Research on Bioweapons and Prevention of Bioterrorism\\", European Commission, via BioWeapons Prevention Project, February 4, 2004, accessed January 5, 2009. The issue is less clear when warfare with uninfected insects against crops is considered.Sims, Nicholas Roger Alan, (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). The Evolution of Biological Disarmament, (Google Books), Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 45-50, (). Genetically engineered insects US intelligence officials have suggested that insects could be genetically engineered via technologies such as CRISPR to create GMO \\"killer mosquitoes\\" or plagues that wipe out staple crops. There is research ongoing to genetically modify mosquitoes to curb the spread of diseases, such as Zika, and the West Nile virus by using mosquitoes modified using CRISPR to no longer carry the pathogen. However this research also shows that it may also be possible to implant diseases or pathogens via genetic modification.Jason Rasgon, \\"Genetically modified mosquitoes may be the best weapon for curbing disease transmission\\", The Conversation, Retrieved 20th May 2019 It has been suggested by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology that current US research into genetically modified insects for crop protection via infectious diseases which spread genetic modifications to crops en masse could lead to the creation of genetically modified insects for use in warfare.Kai Kupferschmidt, \\"Crop-protecting insects could be turned into bioweapons, critics warn\\", Science, Retrieved 20th May 2019R.

Sun angle sensors designed by Adcole have flown on numerous space exploration missions, including Mars Pathfinder and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Automobile and truck engine makers as well as agricultural and construction equipment manufacturers utilize measuring machines and tools from Adcole as well. The company is privately held and reported net sales of more than $30 million in fiscal year 2011. History During World War II, Cole trained the Royal Air Force on the use of radar. He was also program manager of Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs airborne radar unit. Following the war, he helped launch the Laboratory for Electronics, a company that went public in 1957. An engineer by trade, Cole saw the opportunities represented by the Space Race. He invented a sun angle sensor that helped rockets and satellites maintain their orientation in space. Cole‚Äôs invention, which space agencies use even today, provided the impetus behind the launch of Adcole in 1957. In June 2020, the company merged with Deep Space Systems to form Redwirehttps://www.aeroequity.com/redwire/ Redwire. =Expansion= A custom- designed facility for manufacturing, assembly and testing of gauges and other equipment was constructed in Marlborough, Massachusetts in 1983. Within five years, the company expanded the building to make room for 200 employees. A second plant in Pompano Beach, Florida produces high-precision spindles and other components used in Adcole gauges. In recent years, Adcole has seen impressive sales growth in China and the Far East. The burgeoning auto and consumer markets in developing nations such as Thailand, Vietnam and India has buoyed the company‚Äôs already strong position in the market. In 2011, Adcole‚Äôs net income topped the $30 million mark, and the company had approximately 120 employees on the payroll.

Sophisticated gauges ensure that camshafts and crankshafts are within allowable tolerances for size and shape. The level of precision required in engine manufacturing is rigorous; Adcole gauges are reportedly accurate to within 10 12 millionths of an inch (0.25 micron). Precisely engineered engine parts ensure quiet and reliable operation. Adcole has several models of camshaft and crankshaft gauges currently on the market. The Model 1300 crankshaft gauge, released in 2007, is designed to provide fast and accurate readings within a production environment. Model 1300 has an automatic loading feature and can measure parts for roundness, size, timing angle and stroke. The unit can process 60 parts per hour. The Model 1310 is also designed with the factory floor in mind: The unit is capable of 200 measurements per hour. The Model 1310 takes essential measurements of camshafts, integral components of internal combustion engines. Adcole provides camshaft and crankshaft inspection gages for hundreds companies within the automotive supply chain, including: * General Motors * Ford * VW/Audi * Chrysler * Toyota * Fiat * Nissan * Renault * Hyundai * Volvo * Caterpillar * Daimler * BMW * Honda * Cummins * FAW * John Deere Government contracts Adcole technology has been an integral part of crewed and uncrewed spaceflight since the company‚Äôs inception. The company‚Äôs sun angle sensors are used on satellites to control the orientation of the vehicle. For most communication and reconnaissance satellites, a proper orientation is essential for nominal functioning.

At the height of the Sri Lankan Civil War, SFHQ-J included several divisions and the independent brigades. At certain times SFHQ-J would be under the command of an Overall Operational Commander. History The first permanent formation to be established in the Jaffna Peninsula since Ceylon gained its independence from the British in 1948 was the headquarters established by the Ceylon Army for \\"Operations Monty\\" in 1952 to stop illegal immigration of Indian Tamils. In 1963, \\"Operations Monty\\" was renamed Task Force Anti Illicit Immigration (TFAII), expanding its role in supporting the Royal Ceylon Navy coastal patrols and Ceylon Police Force operations in the Northern Province to intercept illicit immigration and smuggling. With the escalation of the Tamil militancy in the Jaffna Peninsula, TFAII was disbanded and replaced with the Task Force 4 Northern Command that served as a field formation for counter insurgency operations in the Northern Province. In 1982, it was renamed the Northern Command which became the permanent headquarters for army units based in the Northern Province, and in 1986 this headquarters was renamed as Security Forces Headquarters (Jaffna) in 1986. In late 1989, the headquarters and units attached to it was reorganized as the 21 Brigade. Following failed peace talks in 1994, and increased military operations in the Jaffna Peninsula, 21 Brigade was renamed Task Force 1. By 1996, Task Force 1 had a tactical area covering the Jaffna Peninsula and area up to Kilinochchi with several divisions under its command, therefore Task Force 1 HQ was converted as the Security Forces Headquarters ‚Äì Jaffna.

It began with a one day walkout in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school district. It escalated to a citywide strike in September of that year, shutting down the public schools for a total of 36 days and increasing racial tensions between Blacks and Jews. Thousands of New York City teachers went on strike in 1968 when the school board of the neighborhood, which is now two separate neighborhoods, transferred a set of teachers and administrators, a normal practice at the time. The newly created school district, in a mostly black neighborhood, was an experiment in community control over schools‚Äîthe dismissed workers were almost all white and Jewish. The United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, demanded the teachers' reinstatement and accused the community-controlled school board of anti-semitism. At the start of the school year in 1968, the UFT held a strike that shut down New York City's public schools for nearly two months. The strike pitted community against union, highlighting a conflict between local rights to self-determination and teachers' universal rights as workers. Although the school district itself was quite small, the outcome of its experiment had great significance because of its potential to alter the entire educational system‚Äîin New York City and elsewhere. As one historian wrote in 1972: \\"If these seemingly simple acts had not been such a serious threat to the system, it would be unlikely that they would produce such a strong and immediate response.\\"  Background  Brownsville = From the 1880s through the 1960s, Brownsville was predominantly Jewish and politically radical. The Jewish population consistently elected Socialist and American Labor Party candidates to the state assembly and was a strong supporter of unionized labor and collective bargaining. Margaret Sanger chose Brownsville as the site of America's first birth control clinic because she knew the community would be supportive.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), pp. 33-37. In 1940, Blacks made up 6% of Brownsville's population. By 1950, their numbers had doubled. Most of these new residents were poor and occupied the neighborhood's most undesirable housing.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 84. Although the neighborhood was racially segregated, there was more public mixing and solidarity among Blacks and Jews than could be found in most other neighborhoods.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), pp. 95‚Äì98. Around 1960, the neighborhood underwent a rapid demographic shift. Citing increased crime and their desire for social mobility, Jews left Brownsville en masse, to be replaced by more Blacks and some Latinos. By 1970, Brownsville was 77% Black and 19% Puerto Rican.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), pp. 148‚Äì149. Furthermore, Brownsville was frequently ignored by Black civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and Urban LeaguePritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 88. whose Brooklyn chapters were based in nearby Bedford- Stuyvesant and were overall less concerned with the issues of the lower income Blacks who had moved into Brownsville, thus further isolating Brownsville's population. These changes corresponded to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, as well as to the replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs.: \\"The years after 1945 in New York were dominated by urban renewal. High-rise office buildings and white-collar employees began to replace tenement factories and working-class New Yorkers. These were also years in which centralization as an operational and philosophical tenet of municipal governance went virtually unchallenged in city life.\\" The newly Black Brownsville neighborhood had few community institutions or economic opportunities. It lacked a middle class, and its residents did not own the businesses they relied upon.: \\"Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville's social ills were a by- product of its boxed-in economic status. A contemporary observer was blunt: 'Brownsville has no middle class. . . . There are no resident doctors, no resident lawyers; Negroes own less than 1 percent of the businesses.'\\" = Schools = Despite the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board ruling against segregated schools, educational segregation in Brooklyn actually increased in the following years, due to segregationist districting and school construction.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), pp. 163-184. Some whites on the neighborhood's periphery lobbied with the school board against the building of a new school that would draw a racially diverse population. They were opposed by Blacks, Latinos, and pro-integration whites, but nevertheless succeeded in functionally limiting the new school's racial makeup.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), pp. 165‚Äì166. In the years before the strike, Brownsville's schools had become extremely overcrowded, and students were attending in shifts.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 221. Junior High School 271, which became the nexus of the strike, was constructed in 1963 to accommodate Brownsville's expanding population of youth. The school's performance was low from the outset, with most students testing below grade level in reading and math, and few advancing to the city's network of elite high schools.: \\"Reading and math scores were among the lowest in the city, with 73 percent of its pupils below grade level in reading and 85 percent in math. In a typical graduating class, only 2 percent went to the city's specialized high schools, which required applicants to pass written entrance examinations and served as feeders to major universities and the city colleges.\\" New York City's school system was controlled by the Central Board of Education, a notoriously large and centralized bureaucracy headquartered at 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn.: \\"The culture of centralization may have been more entrenched in New York's public education system more than anywhere else in the city. By the early 1960s, the system had become a classic example of top-heavy bureaucracy.\\" It became clear to activists in the 1960s that the Central School Board was uninterested in pursuing mandatory integration; their frustration led them away from desegregation and into the struggle for community control.: Given a choice between angering politically potent white voters or a marginalized black community, the board, predictably, took the path of least resistance. By 1966, with the campaign to integrate the city's public school at a dead end, Galamison, EQUAL, and New York's civil rights activists searched for new goals and strategies.\\" = Teachers union = Brownsville's teachers were members of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), a new union Local that had recently displaced the more leftist Teachers' Union (TU).The UFT won the right to represent NYC teachers for the purpose of collective bargaining in 1961: Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 223. The TU, which contained active socialist and communist members campaigned actively for racial equality, desegregation, and other radical political goals. The UFT held a philosophy of limited pluralism, according to which different cultures could maintain some individuality under the umbrella of an open democratic society. The union also championed individualist values and meritocracy. Some called its policies 'race-blind' because it preferred to frame issues in terms of class. The UFT contained a high proportion of Jews. Membership in the American Federation of Teachers, the national union of which the UFT is a part, had increased dramatically during the 1960s, as had the rate of teachers' strikes. In 1964, Bayard Rustin and Reverend Milton Galamison coordinated a citywide boycott of public schools to protest de facto segregation. Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the UFT Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union, however, declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964, boycott, and newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protestors. It was, a newspaper account accurately reported, \\"the largest civil rights demonstration\\" in American history, and, Rustin argued that \\"the movement to integrate the schools will create far-reaching benefits\\" for teachers as well as students. However, when protesters announced plans to follow up the February 3 boycott with a second one on March 16, the UFT declined to defend boycotting teachers from reprisals. Later, at the time of the 1968 school crisis, Brooklyn CORE leader Oliver Leeds and Afro-American Teachers Association President Al Vann would cite the UFT's refusal to support the 1964 integration campaign as proof that an alliance between the teachers' union and the black community was impossible.Daniel Perlstein \\"The dead end of despair: Bayard Rustin, the 1968 New York school crisis, and the struggle for racial justice\\"  Black schools and teachers  The UFT's program for poor Black schools was called \\"More Effective Schools\\". Under this program class sizes would shrink and teachers would double or triple up for individual classes. Although the UFT expected this program to be popular, it was challenged by the African-American Teachers Association (ATA; originally the Negro Teachers Association), a group whose founders in 1964 were also part of the UFT. The ATA felt that New York City's teachers and schools perpetuated a system of entrenched racism, and in 1966 it began campaigning actively for community control. The UFT opposed both involuntary assignment and extra incentives for experienced teachers to come to poor schools. In 1967, the ATA opposed the UFT directly over the \\"disruptive child clause\\", a contract provision that allowed teachers to have children removed from classrooms and placed in special schools. The ATA argued that this provision exemplified and accelerated the system's overall racism. In the fall of 1967, the UFT held a two-week strike, seeking approval for the disruptive child clause; most of the ATA's members withdrew from the union. In February 1968, some ATA teachers helped to produce a tribute to Malcolm X that presented African music and dance, and glorified Black power; the UFT successfully asked that these teachers be disciplined.  Community control  In the New York City school system, regulated by a civil service examination, only 8% of teachers and 3% of administrators were Black. Following Brown v. Board, 4000 students in Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville were bused to white schools, where they complained of mistreatment. Faith in the controllers of the school system was sinking lower and lower. Bolstered by the civil rights movement, but frustrated by resistance to desegregation, African Americans began to demand authority over the schools in which their children were educated. The ATA called for community-controlled schools, educating with a \\"Black value system\\" that emphasized \\"unity\\" and \\"collective work and responsibility\\" (as opposed to the \\"middle class\\" value of \\"individualism\\"). Leftist white allies, including teachers from the recently eclipsed Teachers Union, supported these demands. Mayor John Lindsay and wealthy business leaders, supported community control as a pathway to social stability.) When in 1967 the Bundy Panel, a creation of the Ford Foundation, recommended trying decentralization, the city decided to experiment in three areas‚Äîover the objections of some members of the white middle-classes, who disliked the ideological tendencies that black- controlled schools might embrace. The New York City Board of Education established the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts created by the city. In July 1967, the Ford Foundation issued Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville a $44,000 grant.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 229. The new district operated under a separate, community-elected governing board with the power to hire administrators. If successful, the experiment could have led to citywide decentralization. While the local Black population viewed it as empowerment against what it saw as an intransigent white bureaucracy, the teachers' union and other unions saw it as union busting‚Äîa reduction in the collective bargaining power of the union who would now have to deal with 33 separate, local bodies, rather than a central administration. Rhody McCoy, the new superintendent of the board, began working as a substitute teacher in 1949. He worked in the city's public school system ever since, as a teacher and then principal of a special needs school. He told the New York Times he was gentle but ambitious, and eager to change schools for neglected children. Some described him as a militant follower of Malcolm X, and the UFT opposed the board's decision to appoint him in July 1967. McCoy often frequented a mosque Malcolm X preached at and often visited the preacher's home. McCoy was reported to be influenced by the Harold Cruise book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual and to believe Jews had too much influence in the civil rights movement. McCoy nominated Herman Ferguson as the principal of JHS 271. Ferguson had penned an article in The Guardian in which he wrote his ideal school would have lessons on \\"instructions in gun weaponry, gun handling, and gun safety\\" as survival skills in a hostile society. The nomination was withdrawn. = Curriculum and school environment = Educational stratification in elementary schools was reduced. Fewer grades were issued, and one school abolished grade levels completely. The schools expanded the role of Black and African history and culture in the curriculum. Some schools began to teach Swahili and African counting. One school with a large number of Puerto Rican students became completely bilingual. Reports on the 1967‚Äì1968 school year were generally positive.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 230. \\"The 1967‚Äì1968 school year was a period of positive change in Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville schools, according to the Ford Foundation and other evaluators. Ford reviewers felt that Rhody McCoy was 'strong and capable,' and the board was 'consistent in its approach'. Given its limited financial support, the governing board appeared to be functioning 'as well as can be expected.' The New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) also reported positive changes at Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville schools.\\" Visitors, students, and parents who supported the schools raved about the shift to student-focused education. However, the district still relied on the school board for funding, and many of its requests (e.g., for a telephone and new library books) were reportedly met slowly if at all. Teachers were taken aback by the level of control exercised by the school board, and many objected to the board's new policies concerning personnel and curriculum. The UFT opposed the new principals denounced the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville curriculum, saying that awareness of one's racial heritage would not be helpful in the job market. = Personnel = Once created, the new administration of Ocean-Hill Brownsville began to select principals from outside the approved civil service list. The schools appointed a racially diverse set of five new principals‚Äîincluding New York City's first Puerto Rican principal‚Äîwinning broad support from the community but angering some teachers.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 230. \\"The governing board appointed, over the objections of the UFT, five new principals: one white, two black, one Chinese, and the first Puerto Rican in the city. The Latino principal, Luis Fuentes, struggled to gain the support of the teachers, but, according to the CCHR, he 'quickly gained the respect of the students, parents, and the community. By establishing a rapport with Spanish-speaking parents, the principal served students for whom English was a second language. Parent participation increased dramatically as a result of his efforts.\\" In April 1968, the administration sought additional control over personnel, finance, and curriculum. When the city did not grant these powers, the district's parents initiated a boycott of the schools. The boycotts coincided with unrest due to the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. During disturbances in JHS 271 three teachers were injured. On May 9, 1968, the administration requested the transfer of 13 teachers and 6 administrators from Junior High School 271. The governing board accused these workers of attempting to sabotage the project. All received short letters similar to the following, sent to teacher Fred Nauman: This unilateral decision violated the rules of the union's contract.Berube, Maurice R. and Marilyn Gittell. Confrontation at Ocean Hill-Brownsville; the New York school strikes of 1968 New York, Praeger [1969] OCLC: 19279 The teachers were nearly unanimously Jewish. One Black teacher included on the list, seemingly by accident, was quickly reinstated. In total, 83 workers were dismissed from the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville district. Parents in Brownsville generally supported the governing board. Outsiders appreciated the Black school board's attempt to regain control over its own school system. Shanker called the dismissals \\"a kind of vigilante activity\\" and said the schools had neglected due process. The Board of Education urged the teachers to ignore the letters. Mayor John Lindsay issued a statement countermanding the district's decision and condemning \\"anarchy and lawlessness\\". The dismissals were also condemned by the American Jewish Congress.  Strikes  May = When the teachers tried to return to the school, they were blocked by hundreds of community members and teachers who supported the administration's decision. One sign displayed in the window of the occupied school read, \\"Black people control your schools\\". (At the same time, other teachers were staying off the job as per UFT instructions.) On May 15, 300 police officers, including at least 60 in plainclothes, cordoned off the school (making five arrests), effectively breaking the parent blockade and allowing the teachers to return. The city's Board of Education and the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville board both announced on the same day that the schools would close. From May 22‚Äì24, 350 UFT members stayed out of school in protest. On June 20, these 350 strikers were also dismissed by the governing board. Under the terms of the decentralization agreement, the teachers were returned to the control of the New York City public school system, where they sat idle in the school district offices. = September through November = A series of citywide strikes at the start of the 1968 school year shut down the public schools for a total of 36 days. The union defied the new Taylor Law to go out on strike, and more than a million students were not able to attend school during strike days. On September 9, 1968 93% of the city's 58,000 teachers walked out. They agreed to return on September 11 after the Board of Education ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, but walked out again on September 13, once it became clear that the Board could not enforce this decision.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 231.  Reactions  Black leadership = The NAACP announced support for the strike even though community control deviated from the official integrationist agenda. The strike did have support from Black leaders Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph, who had gained prominence in the labor movement as well as within the civil rights movement. Rustin and Randolph were shunned from the black community due to their position. = Dissent within the UFT = Not all UFT teachers supported the strike, and some actively opposed it with 1,716 union delegates opposing the strike and 12,021 supporting. A statistical study published in 1974 found that teachers‚Äîwhite and Black‚Äîof Black students were significantly more likely to oppose the strike. A coalition of Black and Puerto Rican UFT members, supported by members of other local unions, released a statement supporting Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville and opposing the strike.  Immediate effects  On schools = In Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville  Students and teachers returned to a chaotic atmosphere in the fall. Classes were held despite UFT picket lines outside. Schools ran more smoothly in the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville neighborhood than elsewhere, due to the fact that system was less reliant on the striking teachers and keys to the buildings. The board hired new teachers to replace the strikers, including many local Jews, in an effort to prove that the district was not antisemitic. The district's third graders were shown to have fallen from four months behind before community control to twelve months behind after it. The reading skills of the district's eighth graders were shown to have barely improved by the end of their time in ninth grade. When the original teachers were restored to their posts at JHS 271, students refused to attend their classes.Sometimes the students were led into a separate room by a co-teacher: New York School Superintendent Bernard E. Donovan attempted to close schools in the district and to remove McCoy and most of the principals. When they refused to vacate their positions, Donovan called in the police. The returning teachers were told to go to an auditorium to meet with Unit Administrator McCoy. When they arrived they were threatened and bullets were thrown at them by audience members, a pregnant teacher was punched in the stomach as she left the auditorium.  In New York City at large  Striking teachers were in and out of school during the first weeks of the year, affecting over one million students. Superintendent Donovan ordered many schools locked; in many places, people smashed windows and broke locks to re-enter their school buildings (sealed by union janitors sympathetic to the strike). Some camped on school grounds overnight to prevent further lockouts by janitors and custodians. Some were arrested on trespassing charges. Other parents sent their children to Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville because the schools there were operational. Most of these outside students were Black but some were white; some came long distances to attend the community‚Äìcontrolled schools. = Racism and antisemitism = Shanker was routinely branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being 'Jewish-dominated'. A Puerto Rican group in the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville neighborhood burnt Shanker in effigy. Shanker and some Jewish groups attributed the original firing of the teachers to antisemitism. During the strike, the UFT distributed an official pamphlet called \\"Preaching Violence Instead of Teaching Children in Ocean Hill-Brownsville\\", citing a lesson that advocated Black separatism. Shanker distributed 500,000 copies of a pamphlet some of his members found behind the schools in dispute worded \\"THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT WHEN THE MONEY CHANGERS HEARD ABOUT IT, THEY TOOK OVER, AS IS THEIR CUSTOM IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY\\"When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone: The Epic Struggle to Save Soviet Jewry by Gal Beckerman On December 26, 1968, Julius Lester on WBAI radio interviewed Leslie Campbell a history teacher who read a poem written by one of his students entitled \\"Antisemitism: Dedicated to Albert Shanker\\" that began with the words \\"Hey, Jewboy, with that yarmulke on your head / You pale-faced Jew boy ‚Äì I wish you were dead.\\" The poem then goes on to say the author is sick about hearing about the Holocaust because it lasted only 15 years compared to the 400 years blacks had been suffering. Lester suggested he read that particular poem. Campbell asked Lester \\"Are you crazy?\\". Lester replied \\"No. I think it's important for people to know the kinds of feelings being aroused in at least one child because of what's happening in Ocean Hill-Brownsville.\\".The Soul That Wanders New York Times January 31, 1988Jewish Identity and The JDL. by Janet L. Dugan Displays of Power Controversy from Enola Gay to Sensation by Steven C. Dubin The union filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission and tried to get Campbell fired. The incident further divided the Black and Jewish Communities. Some members of the school community, as well as the New York Civil Liberties Union,Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 233. accused Shanker of playing up antisemitism to win sympathy and support. 70% of the district's new hires were neither Hispanic nor black, and half of these were Jewish.  Resolution  The strike ended on November 17, 1968, when the New York State Education Commissioner asserted state control over the Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville district. The dismissed teachers were reinstated, three of the new principals were transferred, and the trusteeship ran the district for four months.Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 235. The conflict at Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville smoldered after the end of the strike. Eight people charged with harassing strikers counter-sued the city, alleging that law enforcement had been discriminatory and excessive.They charged the city with incarcerating them necessarily and argued that the real obstruction of government had been the strike itself: In 1969 some charged that the schools underwent \\"a purge of militant black teachers\\". When school opened in September 1969, the school district shut itself down for a day in protest of new regulations that deprived it of further autonomy.  Aftermath  In the following weeks, hostility continued between the returning teachers and their students and replacement teachers. During the week of December 2 disorders by black students were reported in schools in four of the five of the city's boroughs as well in the New York City Subway. They were said to be instigated by a rally held by the City Wide Student Strike committee organized by Sonny Carson and JHS 271 teacher Leslie Campbell. Shanker emerged from the strike a figure of national prominence.\\"Public Schools: Strike's Bitter End,\\" Time, Nov. 29, 1968 He was jailed for 15 days in February 1969 for sanctioning the strikes, in contravention of New York's Taylor Law. The Ocean Hill‚ÄìBrownsville district lost direct control over its schools; other districts never gained control over their schools. The UFT crippled the ATA during the 1970s through a lawsuit, filed under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, accusing the ATA of excluding white teachers. The UFT also sought to cut off the ATA's sources of funding and remove its leaders from the school system. Residents of Brownsville continued to feel neglected by the city, and in 1970 some staged the \\"Brownsville Trash Riots\\".Pritchett, Brownsville, Brooklyn (2002), p. 239. When the schools agreed to impose a standardized reading test in 1971, its scores had fallen. The strike badly divided the city and became known as one of John Lindsay's \\"Ten Plagues\\". Scholars have agreed with Shanker's assessment that \\"the whole alliance of liberals, blacks and Jews broke apart on this issue. It was a turning point in this way.\\" The strike created a serious rift between white liberals, who supported the teachers' union, and Blacks who wanted community control. The strike made it clear that these groups, previously allied in the Civil Rights Movement and the labor movement, would sometimes come into conflict. Some groups allied with the civil rights movement and Black Liberation struggles moved towards the creation of independent African Schools, including The East's Uhuru Sasa Shule in Bedford- Stuyvesant. According to historian Jerald Podair, these events also pushed New York's Jewish population into accepting an identity of whiteness, further polarizing race relations in the city. He argues that the shift in coalitions after the 1968 strike pushed New York City to the political right for decades to come‚Äîin part because race came to eclipse class as the main axis of social conflict. The events surrounding the strike were a factor in the decision by Meir Kahane to form the vigilante organization Jewish Defense League which later morphed into a terrorist organization.Terrorism 2000/2001 FBITerrorist Organization Profile: Jewish Defense League University of Maryland  References  Notes  Further reading =  *  External links  * News video containing interviews with people involved (Broken Link) Category:1968 in Judaism Category:Labor relations in New York City Category:Education labor disputes in the United States Category:1968 labor disputes and strikes Category:1968 in New York (state) Category:American Federation of Teachers Category:Multiracial affairs in the United States Category:Jews and Judaism in Brooklyn Category:African-American history in New York City Category:African American‚ÄìJewish relations Category:Racism in the United States Category:Labor disputes in New York (state) ","title":"New York City teachers' strike of 1968"},{"id":"20836550","text":"Hod Lipson (born 1967 in Haifa, Israel) is an American robotics engineer.

Background  Faiman was educated at Willesden County Grammar School and the University of London, and received his Ph.D from the University of Illinois in 1969. After post-doctoral appointments in Oxford and CERN he arrived in Israel in September 1973, to take up an appointment in theoretical physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. However, as a result of the energy crisis that followed the Yom Kippur War, he re-directed his research interests from elementary particles into solar energy. In 1976 he was recruited by Amos Richmond to assist in founding the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at the Sede Boqer campus of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Faiman created the Institutes‚Äô Department of Solar Energy & Environmental Physics, which he headed concurrently with the Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center until his retirement in 2013 at the rank of Professor Emeritus. Faiman lives in Sede Boqer, Israel, in a passive solar house where almost all of the heating and cooling needs are taken care of by the sun. His hobbies include biblical geography, and the music of Giacomo Meyerbeer.  Career  Faiman‚Äôs theoretical physics research focused on hadron spectroscopy using the quark model and various associated symmetries. His solar energy research spanned studies of solar radiation, energy conversion devices, and power-producing systems. His most celebrated work was the development, in collaboration with the Zenith Solar Company, of a 10 m2 mirrored, sun-tracking dish, which concentrated the sun‚Äôs rays 1,000 times onto a water-cooled solar array of dimensions 100 cm2.Reflective mirrors seen raising solar potential, Ari Rabinovitch, Reuters, August 29, 2007.

He was also known as Bill or Billy Webb. Early life Webb was born at Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch, New Zealand, on 21 January 1880 and was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School. In his youth he was a natural athlete being prominent in running and cycling but he turned his attention to rowing. He won various amateur events between 1896 and 1905/06, not only in single sculls but also in doubles and fours. In his last season as an amateur he won the Champion Single Sculls and the Champion Double Sculls events at Picton, and later the Senior Single Sculls at Wanganui, and thus became the amateur New Zealand Champion. By this time Webb had moved to Wanganui to live and he spent the rest of his life there. After winning the amateur events he decided to turn professional. Professional scullingNew Zealand champion= His first professional race was for the New Zealand Sculling Championship against Jim Stanbury, an Australian who was five times World Champion from 1891 to 1896 and again from 1905 to mid 1906. The race was run on the Whanganui River on 26 December 1906, with a purse of ¬£200 a side. Stanbury was nearing the end of his racing career and put up a good row, but was well beaten by Webb in a time of 18m.50s for the three mile course. =World champion= Webb then challenged Charles Towns of Australia, the World Title holder, to a match and ¬£500 as a side stake. Towns had become the title holder after his brother, George Towns, had forfeited it to him; the Webb race was his first defence of the title. This race took place on the Parramatta River, Sydney, Australia, on 2 August 1907. Webb won by five lengths and was declared World Champion by the umpire, despite a protest by Towns regarding an alleged foul by Webb which would have lost him the race. Not all commentators agreed with the umpire; some thought Webb should have lost the race because of the foul. However, as there was no controlling body for the World Title, nor for most other professional sports, the ruling stood. =First defence= Webb returned home to New Zealand to a huge welcome. His first challenge came from Richard Tresidder, an Australian, and the usual ¬£500 side stake was agreed to. This race was set down for 25 February 1908 on the Whanganui River over a distance of about three and a quarter miles. This was the first race ever held in New Zealand for the World Championship, and Webb crossed the line three lengths ahead: his time of 20m.28s made him undisputedly the champion of the world. The 1908 World Title race was commemorated in December 2008 when Olympic champion Olaf Tufte defeated three-time World Champion Mah√© Drysdale and wild card race winner Hamish Bond on the Whanganui River to take home the $5000 cash prize. The race as since been competed for annually under the title of \\"The Billy Webb Challenge.\\" =Championship loss= Webb's next challenge came from fellow New Zealander Richard Arnst, with the stake at ¬£500 a side (a sum representing several years' earnings by a working man at the time). The match was held on the Whanganui River on 15 December 1908, and Arnst won by eight or ten lengths. A rematch between Arnst and Webb was arranged for 22 June 1909 on the same course, and a fast time of 18m.15s was recorded by Arnst who again won, this time by two to three lengths. Webb was involved in several smaller races after this but it was not until 26 December 1910 that his next major professional race took place. No title was involved but the stake was ¬£200 a side. This race was held on the Whanganui River and was against the Australian Champion Harry Pearce. He was a formidable rower, having defeated a record five challenges in the previous year for his Australian Title. Pearce won the race by two lengths despite the best efforts of Webb. Pearce was later an unsuccessful challenger for the World Championship. =Later races= Webb's final professional race was for the Championship of New Zealand. He had previously been the holder of this title, but during his time as World Champion he had forfeited it to another rower, as he was unwilling to risk a loss for a lesser title. His opponent for this next race was another New Zealander, Pat Hannan. The race was run on the Whanganui River on 24 September 1915 and the stake was ¬£200 a side. Webb was a comfortable winner this time. Hannan was later an unsuccessful challenger for the World Championship. The First World War precluded any further professional matches, and when the war was over Webb retired as the undefeated Professional New Zealand Single Sculls Champion. Later events Throughout his life Webb continued to row for pleasure and also gave exhibition rows; he was always willing to help young rowers who sought his assistance. He was well remembered and well thought of in his home of Wanganui, where a street is named after him, and the \\"Billy Webb Challenge\\" rowing regatta is held annuallyhttps://billywebbchallenge.co.nz/about/. The 2016 Billy Webb challenge saw an epic showdown between Olympic champion Mahe Drysdale and silver medallist Croatian Damir Martin, which event manager Kate Austin described as \\"very exciting\\". https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui- chronicle/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503424&objectid;=11746504 Webb died on 2 October 1960.

It is named after the place where it is located in Lucknow(Kukrail Pul). Brief history Kukrail Reserve Forest is located in Indranagar adjacent to Mayur Residency Extension on picnic spot road. In Uttar Pradesh, crocodiles are found in the Ramganga, Suheli, Girwa and Chambal rivers. The female crocodile lays eggs in April by digging holes on the river banks. The young crocodiles hatch in a period of 60 to 80 days. The idea of setting up a breeding center for the endangered crocodile species came after a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, UNO in 1975 which estimated that there were only 300 crocodile left in the open rivers of Uttar Pradesh. The centre at Kukrail came up in the year 1978, which was funded by the Uttar Pradesh forest department in collaboration Ministry of Environment and Forests India. This effort marked the beginning of state government's efforts towards conservation of crocodiles at a time when only 300 of them were left. Conservation efforts Apart from breeding crocodiles in the park, crocodile eggs are also collected from the Ramganga, Suheli, Girwa and Chambal river banks. When young crocodiles come out of these eggs after artificial hatching at the center, they are fed and looked after till they become capable of defending themselves against other predators. The young crocodiles are then released into the waters of Chambal, River Sharda, Ghaghra, Girwa, Ramganga and Ganges rivers. This programme has contributed to the improvement in the gharial's status not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in the neighbouring states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. In fact, the captive- breeding programme for gharial is one of the two such successful wildlife conservation programmes in the country.

The 96th episode of the show overall, \\"He's Our You\\" aired on March 25, 2009, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz and directed by \\"Special\\" director Greg Yaitanes. In 1977, Sayid Jarrah's (Naveen Andrews) presence among the DHARMA Initiative makes them anxious; he is interrogated, and admits everything he knows. In flashbacks, Sayid struggles after his purpose off the island is cut short. PlotFlashbacks= As a child, Sayid watches as his older brother is forced by his father to kill a chicken as a rite of passage. He is unable to do it, so Sayid does it for him; this greatly pleases Sayid's father. While working for Ben (Michael Emerson), Sayid kills a man in Moscow. This is the last man on Ben's hit list, leaving Sayid uncertain about how to continue living his life. After John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) dies, Ben visits Sayid and encourages him to go to Los Angeles. Following the events of \\"This Place is Death\\", Sayid meets Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) at a bar; she skillfully seduces him and then takes him into her custody at gunpoint. She turns out to be a bounty hunter who has been employed to take Sayid to Guam by the family of Peter Avellino (Armando Pucci), who Sayid previously killed for Ben, on the golf course, (as seen in \\"The Economist\\"). After seeing some of the Oceanic Six preparing to board the same flight, he begs her to take the next plane, but she refuses. On the plane, after he sees Ben board, he asks Ilana if she is working for Ben. Sayid describes Ben as a monster and Ilana asks Sayid why should she would work for a man like Ben. Sayid replies, \\"I did.\\" =1977= Following the events of the previous episode, \\"Namaste\\", Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is in the Dharma Initiative's jail. He is questioned by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), Dharma's leader, Radzinsky (Eric Lange), Dharma's head of research, and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), who, under the alias of LaFleur, is Dharma's head of security. Sayid does not say anything and is later visited by a twelve-year-old Ben Linus (Sterling Beaumon). Ben's father (Jon Gries) witnesses this and assaults Ben for bringing Sayid food. Sayid is later confronted one-on-one by Sawyer, who in an effort to save Sayid, tries to convince Sayid to give a false confession of being a defector from the island's native population, the Others. Sayid refuses and is subsequently taken to Oldham (William Sanderson), Dharma's resident interrogation expert (\\"He's our you,\\" as Sawyer describes him to Sayid). Oldham gives Sayid a truth serum which forces Sayid to reveal his knowledge of Dharma's stations, including the future Swan Station, and that he has previously been to the island. However, he also tells them that he is from the future, which discredits his story. Upon returning to the jail, Sayid is once again visited by Ben, who pledges to free Sayid because Ben wishes to join the Others. That evening, several members of the Dharma Initiative take a vote to decide whether to execute Sayid. After an impassioned statement from new mother Amy (Reiko Aylesworth), they all vote in favor of execution. Sawyer attempts to let Sayid escape, but Sayid refuses, stating he has found his purpose for returning to the island. Meanwhile, at the barracks, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) expresses her concern to Sawyer that their relationship will be jeopardized because of Kate Austen's (Evangeline Lilly) return to the island. Kate learns of their relationship from Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). Later in the evening, Sawyer goes to Kate's house and asks her why she came back to the island. Before she can answer, however, a flaming Dharma van crashes into one of the houses. While everyone is distracted by the fire, Ben helps Sayid escape from the jail. They run into Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) during their escape, so Sayid knocks Jin out and steals his gun. After saying to Ben \\"You were right, I am a killer\\" Sayid reluctantly shoots Ben in the chest and runs off.

Foster. Alarmed by frequent mine accidents, Foster advocated better working conditions and stricter safety regulations, which led to Pennsylvania‚Äôs adoption of the Mine Safety Act of 1885 and the requirement for miners to pass a safety exam. In order to help workers pass the new test, Foster began an advice column in the Mining Herald answering mine safety questions. Unsatisfied with this solution, in 1889 he founded the Colliery Engineer School of Mines, the first distance learning institution in the United States. The organisation changed names several times, finally settling on International Correspondence Schools of Scranton. The mission of the school was to ‚Äòprovide practical men with a technical education, and technical men with a practical education.‚Äô To achieve its goal, ICS did not instruct its students by standard textbooks, which it believed often contained extraneous amounts of material and \\"demand[ed] too great a knowledge of mathematics and other subjects.\\" Instead, ICS created its own specially prepared \\"Instruction and Question Papers,\\" which provided exactly the information the student needed and questioned him only on that material. Thomas Coates of Peckville, PA (Born Feb 1868 - Skelton in Cleveland, UK / Died August 7, 1936 in Wilkes Barre, PA) was the first enrolled student of ICS. He enrolled in the complete coal mining course on Oct 16, 1891. He advanced steadily with the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, and eventually became the mine's Superintendent. Noted: Scranton Times Newspaper May 2, 1902 It enrolled 3000 new students in 1894 and, with the creation of a sales force, matriculated approximately 100,000 new students annually in the early 1900s. By 1900, one in 27 Americans had taken a correspondence course with ICS. The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography states that it is ‚Äòby far the largest single educational institution in America‚Äôs history‚Äô. Foster remained the president of ICS until his death in 1936 at age 93. The organisation expanded to the UK in 1904 which is now known as ICS Learn.

Premise and run The show took place in the fictional Hotel Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland, and drew its title from the cheap establishment's neon marquee which had a burned-out letter \\"e\\". The half-hour series premiered January 24, 1975, and was produced by Norman Lear for ABC. It was the first Lear property to air on ABC. The series had several controversial elements, including two primary characters who were prostitutes, one of whom was an illegal immigrant, and one of the first gay couples to be depicted on an American television series. Because of the subject matter, the show was the first ABC network show to have a warning at its opening, cautioning viewers about mature themes. (All in the Family, also produced by Lear, ran a similar disclaimer when it debuted in 1971 on CBS, but ceased doing so with its second telecast.) The network supported the show and gave it a full publicity campaign, but it failed to win an audience and was canceled after 13 episodes. Its last telecast was June 6, 1975. WJZ-TV, then ABC's Baltimore affiliate, never carried the show, but instead, carried alternative programming, leaving Baltimore viewers to have to watch the show on WMAL (now WJLA), ABC's Washington, D.C. affiliate. This series is notable as the first failure for Lear after a streak of mega-hit TV series, beginning with All in the Family (1971) and continuing with Sanford and Son (1972), Maude (1972), Good Times (1974), and The Jeffersons (1975), the last of which premiered six days before this show.

It is often directly translated as \\"bondservant\\", although sometimes also rendered as \\"slave\\" (\\"nucai\\"). Concept According to Mark C. Elliott, the word \\"booi\\" could be confusing due to the absence of a proper Chinese word having the same meaning. The Manchu phrase literally means \\"of the household\\", but calling booi aha \\"slaves\\" conveys the wrong meaning. The reason is that there is no corresponding social status in Chinese society for booi, who often served in powerful positions and were sometimes intimates of the emperor. As a compromise in Chinese they were called \\"bao-yi\\", but this caused further misunderstanding. In Manchu documents, booi only sometimes mean \\"bond servant\\", and despite the common belief it can simply refer to \\"people to my house\\" in some occasions. Pamela Kyle Crossley wrote in her book Orphan Warriors: \\"The Mongol is the slave of his sovereign. He is never free. His sovereign is his benefactor; [the Mongol] does not serve him for money.\\" This Mongolian \\"traditional model of slave to owner\\" was taken up by the Manchu during the development of the Eight Banner military system. Crossley gave as the definition of Manchu: \\"A Manchu was, moreover, a man who used his skills exclusively to serve the sovereign....banners as institutions were derived from Turkic and Mongolian forms of military servitude, all enrolled under the banners considered themselves slaves of the emperor and called themselves so (aha, ) when addressing him...\\". Usage In his book China Marches West, Peter C. Perdue stated: \\"In 1624 (after Nurhaci's invasion of Liaodong), Chinese households who had 5 to 7 Manchu sin of grain (800 to 1,000 kg) were given land and houses, while those with less were made into slaves.\\" The Manchu established a close personal and paternalistic relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhaci said: \\"The Master () should love the slaves and eat the same food as them\\". Perdue further pointed out that booi aha \\"did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of \\"bondservant-slave\\" (); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate \\"booi\\" as \\"bondservant\\". In the book A History of Chinese Civilization, Jacques Gernet pointed out that Chinese agricultural slaves were employed as early as the fifteenth century, and by the late sixteenth century it was observed that all the Manchu military commanders had both field and house servants. Between 1645 and 1647, Qing rulers enclosed () large numbers of previously Chinese owned estates over vast areas of North China, eastern Mongolia and neighborhood of Peking, and for land cultivation they were using a labor force consisting of bondservants which were previous land owners and prisoners of war. According to Gernet, regardless of repeated calls from the leader Nurhaci that \\"The Master should love the slaves\\", Manchu slave masters treated their slaves very harshly, arranged numerous corvees (), and sold and bought their slaves as if they were animals. Booi was sometimes regarded as synonymous with booi aha, but booi usually referred to household servants who performed domestic service, whereas aha usually referred to the servile people who worked in fields. The Liaodong Han Chinese The number of booi aha of the Imperial Household Department seems to have risen mainly during the Nurhaci's conquest of the eastern fringes of the Liao River basin in the 1610s and 1620s, resulting in the massive increase of the numbers of captives. In 1618, Nurhaci increased the Jurchen state's population by 300,000 by the taking of Fu-shun. This large increase of its population changed the policy on booi aha. During the first year of conquest (to 1624), the captured Chinese were generally enslaved, and bore obligations to private persons, while later (in 1624‚Äì1625) they were often enrolled in the ranks of the semi-dependent agriculture class, jusen, who bore obligations to the state. Freeholder status was given to Li Yongfang's 1,000 troops after his surrender of Fushun, and the later Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) Bao Chengxian and Shi Tingzhu also experience good fortune in Qing service after their surrenders in 1622 at Guangning.Elliott 2001, p. 76. The Aha were made out of enslaved Jurchens, Koreans, Han Chinese, and Mongols before 1616, they then became part of the booi (bondservants) attached to Manchu Banners, there is no evidence that after 1621 most of the booi were Han Chinese despite the mistaken view held by many of this topic, many different ethnic groups were booi including Koreans and ethnic Manchu bondservants as well.Elliott 2001, p. 83. Both Koreans, Han Chinese, and Jurchens who were prisoners of war or abducted became part of the Aha, the forerunner of the booi (bondservants) in the Banners, although the Jurchens integrated into their own some of the earlier captured Han Chinese and Koreans.Elliott 2001, p. 51. The Jianzhou Jurchens accepted some Han Chinese and Koreans who became Ju≈°en (freeholders) on Jianzhou land.Elliott 2001, p. 52. Russians, Koreans, Manchus, and Han Chinese were all bondservants in the Imperial Household. Some lands for farming in Manchuria were used to dump soldiers after the position of kaihuren was assigned to former booi. The Imperial Exam resulted in the bureaucracy receiving some important booi while others fled as there was a drastic drop in booi population. The Imperial court saw the rise of the Han Chinese booi Cao Yin. Upper Three Banners of Neiwufu The Manchu Booi Aha (Home slaves) system was the origin of the Neiwufu () or Imperial Household Department organization. The personnel of this department came from the booi of the Manchu Eight Banner's upper three banners: Border Yellow, Plain Yellow and Plain White. The highest official's title was Dorgi Baita Icihiyara Amban, a Manchu term (), a position mostly occupied by Manchu princes. The Upper Three Banners of the Neiwufu () (Manchu: booi ilan gusa) was a unique military system of Manchu. Apart from providing the clothing, food, housing and transportation for the operating of daily functioning of the imperial family, it also had a military function, which is to provide military protection for the inner imperial court. In the Qing court, the number of eunuchs was reduced to less than 10% of that of Ming court because eunuchs were replaced by booi, the Qing imperial court's home servants. =Various classes of Booi= #Booi niru a Manchu word () meaning Neiwufu Upper Three Banner platoon leader (about 300 men). #Booi guanlin a Manchu word () meaning the manager of the booi, doing all the domestic duties of the Neiwufu. # Booi amban is also a Manchu word, meaning high official (). # Estate bannerman () are those renegade Chinese who joined the Jurchen, or original civilian-soldiers working in the fields. These people were all turned into booi aha, or field slaves. Status Chinese scholar Mo Dongyin () in his Essays on Manchu History () wrote that booi has a dual meaning: (1) Household servants, and (2) slaves. But in Manchu society, booi () occupied a special class, in which they serve their masters by doing all kinds of manual work and at the same time, with the permission from the master (), can enslave other booi, thus becoming masters themselves. With the establishment of the Qing dynasty and the maturity of its political system, booi were organized into Booi Gusa (Manchu: Slave Banner) and incorporated into both the Eight Banners Army and the Imperial Household Department. Booi had since become part of the Qing dynasty political hierarchy, with the emperor being the Master, and emperor's booi working for the Master and the imperial court simultaneously. When addressing the emperor, booi would refer to themselves as Nupu or Nucai (, or ). But when booi were addressing others, even though they were Nucai of the emperor (), they would refer to themselves as Superior officials of the Han Chinese (). It was possible for Han Bannermen and Han bondservants (booi) to become Manchu by being transferred into the upper three Manchu Banners and having their surname Manchufied by adding a \\"giya\\" ‰Ω≥ at the end as a suffix. The process was called Êä¨Êóó in Chinese. It typically occurred in cases of intermarriage with the Qing Aisin Gioro Imperial family, and the close relatives (fathers and brothers) of the concubine or Empress would get promoted from the Han Banner to the Manchu Banner and become Manchu. Manchu families adopted Han Chinese sons from families of bondservant Booi Aha origin and they served in Manchu company registers as detached household Manchus and the Qing imperial court found this out in 1729. Manchu Bannermen who needed money helped falsify registration for Han Chinese servants being adopted into the Manchu banners and Manchu families who lacked sons were allowed to adopt their servant's sons or servants themselves. The Manchu families were paid to adopt Han Chinese sons from bondservant families by those families. The Qing Imperial Guard captain Batu was furious at the Manchus who adopted Han Chinese as their sons from slave and bondservant families in exchange for money and expressed his displeasure at them adopting Han Chinese instead of other Manchus. These Han Chinese who infiltrated the Manchu Banners by adoption were known as \\"secondary-status bannermen\\" and \\"false Manchus\\" or \\"separate- register Manchus\\", and there were eventually so many of these Han Chinese that they took over military positions in the Banners which should have been reserved for Manchus. Han Chinese foster-son and separate register bannermen made up 800 out of 1,600 soldiers of the Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners of Hangzhou in 1740 which was nearly 50%. Han Chinese foster-son made up 220 out of 1,600 unsalaried troops at Jingzhou in 1747 and an assortment of Han Chinese separate-register, Mongol, and Manchu bannermen were the remainder. Han Chinese secondary status bannermen made up 180 of 3,600 troop households in Ningxia while Han Chinese separate registers made up 380 out of 2,700 Manchu soldiers in Liangzhou. The result of these Han Chinese fake Manchus taking up military positions resulted in many legitimate Manchus being deprived of their rightful positions as soldiers in the Banner armies, resulting in the real Manchus unable to receive their salaries as Han Chinese infiltrators in the banners stole their social and economic status and rights. These Han Chinese infiltrators were said to be good military troops and their skills at marching and archery were up to par so that the Zhapu lieutenant general couldn't differentiate them from true Manchus in terms of military skills. Manchu Banners contained a lot of \\"false Manchus\\" who were from Han Chinese civilian families but were adopted by Manchu bannermen after the Yongzheng reign. The Jingkou and Jiangning Mongol banners and Manchu Banners had 1,795 adopted Han Chinese and the Beijing Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners had 2,400 adopted Han Chinese in statistics taken from the 1821 census. Despite Qing attempts to differentiate adopted Han Chinese from normal Manchu bannermen the differences between them became hazy. These adopted Han Chinese bondservants who managed to get themselves onto Manchu banner roles were called kaihu ren (ÈñãÊà∂‰∫∫) in Chinese and dangse faksalaha urse in Manchu. Normal Manchus were called jingkini Manjusa.

This unit is also known as the Deep Penetration Unit (DPU) and as the Mahasohon Brigade (Mahasohona is a demon, who made unexpected attacks at night, according to Sinhalese folklore hence literally meaning the Brigade who attacked clandestinely and unexpectedly). Colonel Raj Vijayasiri of the Special Forces is credited as the main figure who introduced the DPU concept and the Mahasohon Brigade to the Special Forces. LRRP units carry out the most complex and dangerous military operations of Sri Lanka. In the recent Sri Lankan Civil War, LRRP units have been successful in assassinating several high-level commanders of the LTTE in LTTE-held territory. The unit has also been accused of launching attacks on and killing civilians. The LRRP suffered a setback when a safehouse was raided by the police; they arrested several personnel along with weapons. Before the misunderstanding was later cleared out and the arrested released, the names of the personnel involved in the unit were released to the public media, resulting in the assassination of several of them. The LRRP was later reformed and has resumed its activities following the resumption of hostilities after a ceasefire between the government and the LTTE was canceled. Organization The exact number of troops involved with the LRRP is not known, and neither the Sri Lanka Army nor the Sri Lankan government has officially acknowledged its existence. The unit is operated under the Directorate of Military Intelligence of the Army. It is believed to be composed of personnel from the Commando and Special Forces regiments of the Sri Lanka Army as well as former members of Tamil militant groups. These personnel have received specialized training in Sri Lanka and abroad. Allegations have been made that LRRP units received training from US Special Forces. The LRRP was believed to have been led by captain Shahul Hameed Nilam before the ceasefire, with Major Tuan Nizam Muthaliff acting as a deputy commander.  History Exposure= The date of formation of the LRRP remains classified but is believed to have influenced the LTTE to enter the ceasefire agreement with the Government in 2002 to cease LRRP activities. LRRP activities were ceased. The military believed that the targeting of high-profile LTTE leadership by the LRRP was a prominent factor in prompting the LTTE to agree for negotiations. The existence of LRRP was revealed as a result of a raid in 02 January 2002, when a police team led by SP Kulasiri Udugampola raided an LRRP safehouse in Athurugiriya, a suburb close to the capital, Colombo under the belief of an assassination plot on the leaders of the recently elected United National Party government. Six personnel were arrested, including Captain Nilam, the leader of the unit. Four soldiers and a former LTTE cadre were also arrested. In addition, a number of weapons were taken into custody, including explosives, anti-tank and thermobaric weapons. Details of this raid and the weapons were made public through media. Attempts by the military hierarchy to get the arrested personnel released failed, and Army commander Lt. Gen. Lionel Balagalla issued a public statement revealing the true nature of this unit. The arrested personnel were released only after interrogation on 13 January, under orders from Defence Minister Tilak Marapana, who expressed outrage over the police raid. Soon after the incident, LTTE began a campaign to eliminate the members of the LRRP and those who were suspected of assisting them. A key informant of the unit, known as Mike, was abducted and killed by the LTTE on 20 January. More than 80 persons involved with the LRRP were assassinated after this. The newly elected government did not take any significant measures to stop it, and requests made by the state intelligence agencies were ignored on the basis that it will affect the ceasefire. The Army Commander, under the direction of the Defence Minister, appointed a Court of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the LRRP. The conclusion of the court of inquiry was that their activities were legitimate and all military hardware found were obtained through legitimate means. As the public controversy on this incident and the killings continued, President Chandrika Kumaratunga appointed a Commission of Inquiry to probe the safehouse raid. The Commission‚Äôs conclusion was that in addition to compromising national security interests, the raid was a \\"total betrayal and absolute treachery to the nation\\". The report included a list of officers of the police and army responsible for the incident. A special team was set up by the Chief of Police to investigate into the actions of Udugampola and several other police officers. =Reformation= After the ceasefire was canceled and hostilities resumed in 2006, LRRP was reformed and actively participating in the operations against the LTTE. The LRRP has launched several attacks against LTTE leaders. Head of the LTTE military intelligence, Col. Charles, was killed in one such attack. Cheliyan, the deputy leader of the Sea Tigers, was also killed in an LRRP attack. The LTTE accused the LRRP of targeting civilians in areas under their control but military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara denied any involvement in these incidents, stating that the LRRP only targets armed LTTE cadres. In June 2008, The LTTE accused LRRP units of killing 26 civilians in three attacks alleged attacks and have also blamed LRRP for targeting a bus carrying school children, and the killing of Tamil National Alliance member K. Sivanesan. It was also accused of assassinating Father M. X. Karunaratnam, the chairman of the Pro-LTTE North East Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR). Operations LRRP units have been successful in carrying out several attacks behind enemy lines. Operations use small groups, who go into and out of enemy territory clandestinely through jungle routes and seek their targets. These groups may stay in safehouses or camp in the jungles until they are ready to take their designated target. Many of the attacks launched by LRRP units targeted high- profile LTTE commanders and were carried out in the manner of roadside ambushes. Before the 2002 ceasefire agreement was signed, the government denied allegations from the LTTE that state-backed deep-penetration units were targeting their leaders. Colonel Shankar, head of the LTTE air wing, was killed in such an attack on 6 September 2001. Although his death was speculated to be a result of an internal struggle within the LTTE, the LTTE accused Army LRRP units of launching the attack that killed him. A senior sea tiger commander, Lt. Col. Gangai Amaran, was another high-profile LTTE leader killed by the LRRP. Other LTTE commanders killed in LRRP attacks include Batticaloa District Intelligence Head Lt. Col. Nizam, LTTE Batticaloa-Ampara Communications Chief Major Mano and artillery specialist Major Sathiyaseelan. Former head of the LTTE political wing, S. P. Tamilselvan‚Äôs vehicle was attacked by LRRP units in May 2001. Tamilselvan was not in the vehicle at the time. LRRP units have also made failed assassination attempts on several other LTTE leaders including Col. Karuna, Col. Jeyam and Col. Balraj. The LTTE has accused the LRRP of attempting to carry out attacks even against the LTTE leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.

Eudo is known as \\"dapifer\\" because of his position as a stewardThe household office of steward (sewer, or dapifer) in the mid to late eleventh century had not yet evolved into the great office of state, later called the Lord High Steward. It paralleled the dapifer‚Äôs position in the French court, that of a chef-du-service, or server at the royal banquet table. The rapid rise to prominence of the dapifer in the English court was more due to the officers themselves than the position they held.

After the Norman Conquest of England all five brothers and their father were in England. Eudo's brother Ralph was named Castellan of Nottingham, Hubert had custody of Norwich Castle, and Adam was one of the commissioners of the Domesday Survey in 1085. Eudo received lands in Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hampshire, Norfolk and in Suffolk;Farrer, Honors and Knights' Fees, vol. iii, 165 as well as being a steward in the English royal household by at least 1072. Sometime after the Domesday Survey he inherited the lands of his brother Adam, held of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and those of his brother William at Bardley, Hertfordshire.

It is composed of a junior high school, encompassing grades 7 through 9, and a senior high school, encompassing grades 10 through 12. It is an experimental base for teaching reform considered by the Chinese Ministry of Education and Beijing Normal University. The school is well-known for its core values and academic excellence, as well as for the torture and murder of Bian Zhongyun, a deputy principal at the school and one of the first victims of the Cultural Revolution. History In March 1917, the Girls' Middle School Attached to Beijing Girls' Normal School () was established. In July 1924, the Girls' Middle School became subordinated to the newly established Girls' Normal University (). In July 1931, Girls' Normal University and Beijing Normal University integrated. At the time of this joining, the School's name changed to Girls' Middle School Attached to Beijing Normal University (). The Party branch and general Party branch were successively founded in Girls' Middle School Attached to Beijing Normal University in July 1945 and August 1946. In 1949 and 1952, Girl Student's Section of North China YuCai Middle School (), Private Wen Hua Girls Middle School () and North China Middle School () were successively integrated into our school. The school was then moved to No.14, Erlong Road, Xicheng District. In September 1955, the name of the school was changed to Beijing Experimental High School () by the Ministry of Education. The event was commemorated by Guo Moruo, a famous writer, who wrote the new name of the school in calligraphy. In 1956, the school was classified as a key school of Beijing. In March 1957, Chairman Mao Zedong made remarks on the diary of \\"working back in the countryside\\" written by Wang Guiqin (), a student from the school. In April 1960, Liu Shaoqi wrote a few words of encouragement for a class called \\"Studying for Revolution\\", which was offered to second-year students. In 1961, the school pioneered teaching reform of five-year middle school (three years for junior middle school and two years for senior middle school) nationwide under the leadership of Central Publicity Department and Ministry of Education. In August 1964, the school returned to the administration of Beijing Normal University and resumed the former name the Girls' Middle School Attached to Beijing Normal University. On August 5, 1966, Bian Zhongyun, the school's deputy principal, was tortured and beaten to death by her students, led by Song Binbin. She was the first fatality of the Cultural Revolution. Witnesses said she was tortured all day, while her students shaved her head, poured ink on her head, jabbed her head with scissors, beat her until her eyes rolled into her head, and laughed as she foamed at the mouth. In 2007 the school published a picture book of famous alumni featuring Bian and Song on opposing pages. The publication led to widespread anger and scorn among victims of Mao-era violence. In 1968, male students were permitted admission, marking an end to the 50-year history of female-only admission. In 1972, the school was renamed Beijing No.150 Middle School (), under the administration of the Xicheng District of Beijing. In 1978, the school became subordinated to Beijing Normal University with the present name the Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, and regained the title of Beijing municipal top school, with students enrolled citywide on the basis of competitive selection. In 1980, the school initiated a selective course dealing with computer science nationwide. In 1982, during the 65th anniversary celebration, the school received various encouraging inscriptions from the central government leader Chen Yun, Beijing municipal government leaders as well as other well-known celebrities, such as Zhou Peiyuan, Ye Shengtao, Hua Luogeng. In 1983, the school was determined by the Ministry of Education as an experimental field in implementing course outlines for Middle School Moral Education, and initiated related research and experiments nationwide. In 1984, the school pioneered nationwide curriculum reform on the basis of curricular teaching and combining curricular and extracurricular activities. In 1986, the school conducted experiments regarding the implementation of Middle School Civics Education Reform, a key research topic of the state's Seventh Five-Year Plan. In 1989, the middle school Chinese textbooks compiled by the school teachers since 1978 were approved by the Ministry of Education as experimental textbooks nationwide. In 1992, (approved by the Ministry of Education) these textbooks were spread nationwide as trial editions for middle schools in implementing nine-year compulsory education, and are now widely used in Beijing. In 1991, the high school Chinese textbooks, compiled by school teachers and used as trial editions school-wide, were approved by the Ministry of Education to be officially published. In 1992, Premier of State Council Li Peng and Director of the Central Advisory Committee Chen Yun wrote inscriptions for the 75th anniversary celebration. In 1993, the school defined its mission statement. In 1994, the school was classified by the Beijing Educational Bureau as a model school of all-around education with unique schooling characteristics. Approved by Beijing Education Commission, the school became one of the two privileged schools to organize its own exit exams for graduating seniors. In 1995, the school was classified as an advanced school in research of educational science. In 1995, the school was evaluated as a model school in promotion of public health. It was awarded the Bronze Medal in 1996, the Silver Medal in 1997 and the Gold Medal in 2000. In March 1997, Al Gore (the former vice- president of the United States of America) paid a visit to the school, and discussed the implementation of his GLOBE Program with students. In the same month, the school, along with the Educational Department of Brunswick Province and the Canadian government, founded the Beijing Concord College of Sino- Canada (). In 1997, on the 80th anniversary, Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin and Vice-premier Li Lanqing wrote inscriptions for the school. In 1998, the school was classified by the Ministry of Education as an experimental school in implementing modern educational technology among national primary and middle schools. In November 1999, Nane Annan, the wife of Mr. Kofi Annan, the 7th Secretary General of the United Nations visited the school. In August 2000, Beijing Experimental Jin Hui Network Tech Company Limited (), co-run by Hong Kong Gao Yang Corporation and the school, was formally established. In December 2000, the school passed the evaluation of the first six Beijing-based model high schools, and was highly praised by education experts.  Academics  \\"Pursuing development, pursuing excellence\\" is the educational motto of the school. 100% of the graduating class go to college, 26% percent of which go to the top two Chinese Universities: Peking University and Tsinghua University. The school has an International Department in its high school division for students who wish to study abroad in college. The Department offers Advanced Placement classes, as well as SAT preparation classes.

The addition of extra features not found in authentic products is indicative of shanzhai electronics, particularly in the early 2000s Shanzhai () is a Chinese term literally meaning \\"mountain fortress\\" or \\"mountain village\\" whose contemporary use usually encompasses counterfeit, imitation, or parody products and events and the subculture surrounding them. Shanzhai products can include counterfeit consumer and electronic goods, which can involve the imitation and trademark infringement of brands and companies. The term's modern usage grew around 2008 when counterfeit smartphones reached their greatest domestic use. Today, some relate the term with grassroots innovation and creativity rather than with falsehood or imitation. Origin The term shanzhai was first used for its literal meaning, which referred to defensible mountain forts and strongholds, usually in areas on the outer reaches of imperial government control. During the Song dynasty, shanzhai came to describe groups of bandits who opposed and evaded the corrupt authorities to perform deeds they saw as justified. One of the most well known uses of shanzhai in this way is in the story Water Margin. Shanzhai goods are often regarded as rebelling against the established commercial market, adopting the spirit of opposition and individuality that the term was originally associated with during the Song dynasty. Some shanzhai products are created with the intent to deceive buyers, although others are created with features not included in their respective authentic counterparts, or are created out of jest or parody (such as the CCSTV New Year's Gala). An alternate theory for the use of the term today is that due to the majority of imitation electronics manufacturers being in Shenzhen, wholesalers from other parts of the country referred to the products as \\"Shenzhen products\\", which gradually became the term \\"shanzhai products\\" due to both sounding similar in Mandarin Chinese spoken with a Cantonese accent. This may also relate to the term's use in Cantonese slang to refer to low-quality family-based factories which were viewed as producing these goods. Products During the early-2000s, early instances of shanzhai production began, mostly with simple counterfeiting of simple electronic goods including DVD and MP3 players in cities such as those in the Pearl River Delta. In the mid-2000s, more advanced products such as smartphones were being created, with varying levels of skill and quality, leading to the term shanzhai being applied to counterfeit goods. By the end of 2006, it is estimated that shanzhai mobile phone manufacturers accounted for around 30 percent of the domestic phone market in China. In 2010, the Financial Times estimated that Shanzhai phones accounted for about 20 percent of the global 2G mobile phone market. Demand for these 2G-era shanzhai mobile phones was not only in China, but particularly in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America as well. The prevalence of shanzhai mobile phones is usually attributed to their low price, multi- functional performance, and imitations of trendy mobile phone design. Although shanzhai companies do not use branding as a marketing strategy, they are known for their flexibility of design to meet specific market needs. In 2009, it was reported that shanzhai mobile phones could be sold for about $100 to $150 USD, while production costs were only about $20 USD. Reflecting the interests of customers, some shanzhai companies reflect politics and culture through their products, often alongside parody. One of the most well-publicized examples of this was during Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign, when some shanzhai mobile phone companies began to include Obama-based themes in their goods and advertisements. Also in 2008, some shanzhai products were based on the Beijing National Stadium and Fuwa in light of the Beijing Olympic Games that year. In January 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce announced a crackdown on shanzhai phone sellers and manufacturers. The administration blamed \\"money-stealing\\" services that used the cheap phones to steal services using customers' SIM cards. Industry commentator Liu Sheng said that it was more likely to be linked to the country's intellectual property rights protection campaigns. = Decline = Since the 2010s, there has been a decrease in the prevalence of shanzhai products within China. Although some groups and individuals do still make replica or fake versions of popular products, the growth of well-established domestic companies producing low-cost and/or high-quality electronic goods has elapsed much of the market for counterfeit goods. Groups that do counterfeit domestic companies are also often subject to legal repercussions for their actions, while the counterfeiting of foreign goods is much more difficult to prosecute. Another reason involved in the decline in shanzhai electronics may be related to the transition of MediaTek to producing chips for more established companies, rather than just for the general consumer market. During the early-2000s, many shanzhai mobile phones used MediaTek chips, since they were inexpensive and were widely available. This transition has made it more difficult for small groups to produce smartphones and other popular electronic products to the same extent that was possible in the early-2000s. = Notable Brands = *CECT is a company which offered unauthorized clones or replicas of the Apple iPhone and various Nokia cell phones sold at a fraction of the price of the originals during the 2G- and 3G-eras. At least one reseller has been subject to legal demands from Apple. * One company that earned notoriety for producing shanzhai smartphones is Goophone, which in 2012 was reported to have filed a patent for the \\"Goophone i5\\", a MediaTek-powered clone marketed prior to the real iPhone 5's official release. = Internet = Due to the growth of internet access in China, websites have been created that attempt to spoof real ones, some with the intent to scam. In 2019, the Ministry of Public Security reported that since 2016 more than 5,000 shanzhai websites had been shut down, alongside 16,000 online groups, and 20,000 accounts. Some of these were said to include deceptive wording in their names, with terms such as \\"Central\\" () \\"China\\" ( or ) and \\"National\\" () used to imitate real government websites and users. Subculture The subculture surrounding shanzhai both covers the subculture that developed among groups producing shanzhai goods, such as in the Pearl River Delta, as well as a more generally-supported subculture based on parodying popular franchises and trends. Some of the most well-known events include the CCSTV New Year's Gala, Shanzhai Lecture Room (), Shanzhai Olympic Torch Relay (), and Shanzhai Nobel Prize (). One thing these events have in common is that they all imitate high-end, popular yet authoritative events in which grass-roots power usually has no participating role. Shanzhai movies are another profit-driven shanzhai phenomenon. These movies usually have low budgets, yet achieve commercial success by parodying, making fun of or borrowing elements from high-end Hollywood blockbuster movies. One of the first shanzhai movies is Ning Hao‚Äôs Crazy Stone. It imitates the multi-angle shooting, rapid cutting and stunts that are usually used in Hollywood action movies, yet it retains a grass-roots set up. With only a $3 million HKD budget, Crazy Stone achieved 22 million-box-office revenue of $22 million HKD. Critical reception An imitation Adidas tennis shoe marketed under the name \\"Adibos\\" while using Adidas' logo In the Western world in countries such as the United States, shanzhai products are often viewed as humorous fakes due to their common use of misspelled or comical names imitating those of real companies. Generally, shanzhai products are viewed in the West as low-quality, cheap, and fake. The influence of this view of shanzhai goods has led to the perception among some that all Chinese-produced goods are low quality or are fakes of foreign goods. Shanzhai products are negatively perceived by many companies whose products have been counterfeited, both in China and abroad. Within China, companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have faced issues of smaller companies and groups counterfeiting of their goods. Although electronics companies are most prone to this kind of counterfeiting, other industries have faced competition from shanzhai companies as well. In 2019, the Jinhongye Paper Group successfully won a lawsuit against the Hangzhou Fuyang Paper Company for their shanzhai version of one of Jinhongye's products, which was regarded as an improvement in commercial protections. Jinhongye produces high quality paper marketed as Qingfeng (), which Hangzhou Fuyang imitated in their sale of paper similarly marketed as Qingfeng (). After a ruling by the Hangzhou Internet Court, Hangzhou Fuyang was forced to pay 1 million RMB to Jinhongye and to stop marketing their paper as Qingfeng.

His band, the Concha de Oro (the 'Golden Shell'), founded in the early 19th century, was the most popular band of its time. It played the dance music of the epoch at the balls of the island's aristocracy: contradanzas, minuets, rigadoons, quadrilles, lancers, waltzes. Concha de Oro was basically a t√≠pica, or wind orchestra, which was sometimes augmented to 100 players for special occasions such as fiestas. Brindis de Salas, a disciple of the maestro Ignacio Calvo, was also a composer of creole danzas and the author of an operetta, Congojas matrimoniales. In 1844 his musical career was interrupted by his involvement in the Escalera Conspiracy, for which whites were absolved, but blacks paid dearly. Brindis de Salas was arrested and tortured.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p165 He was banished from the island by the Governor, O'Donnell. Returning in 1848, he was imprisoned for two years, and when he eventually was free to think about reorganizing his band, he found out that most of them had been executed.

He has offices in Toronto, Quebec, Shanghai, Dubai and Montevideo.Carlos Ott (in Spanish) Education Ott graduated from the School of Architecture at the University of the Republic, Uruguay at the age of 23. In 1971, he received the Fulbright Scholarship and went to study at the University of Hawaii and graduated with a Masters in Architecture and Urban Design from Washington University's School of Architecture in 1972. Early career From 1972 to 1974, he worked as an architect for Baldwin & Cheshire Architects in Brunswick, Georgia, and for ARQUECO in San Jose, Costa Rica. In 1975, he moved to Canada where he was associate architect until 1979 at Moffat, Moffat Kinoshita & Associates Architects in Toronto. From 1979 to 1983, he joined Cadillac Fairview Corporation as architect responsible for commercial and multi-purpose projects in Canada.

Plot The story begins at Ravanan's (Prakash Raj) abode and the time of Ramayana when he orders his uncle Mareesan (Jayaram) to transform into a deer to abduct Seetha (Regina Cassandra). Mareesan argues with Ravana but finally complies since Idumba (Raju Eswaran) and Ravana threaten the life of Mareesan's lover Mandahini (Samiksha). Finally, the said thing happens, and Mareesan gets struck by the arrow by lord Rama. He becomes a rock, but not before he transforms Idumba into an anklet and wears it on his leg. Times change, and the modern day comes. Rajaram (Nassar) is a very rich man who owns tea estates. He has Seetha (Saranya Mohan) as his dietitian and Sri Rama (Aravind Akash) as his cook. Both Rama and Seetha are in love. On the other hand, Rajaram's relatives (Thirupathi (M. S. Bhaskar) and Mayilsamy) plan a plot to take the property. In this process, they end up planning to kill Seetha by pushing her from a mountaintop. Seetha falls directly on the rock idol of Mareesan and gets his human form. At the same time, his anklet falls off and gets eaten by a fish. That fish is caught by fisherman Manickam (Nassar), and Idumba gets his human form.
