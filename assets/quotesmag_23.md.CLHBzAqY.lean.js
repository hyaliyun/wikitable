It survives at the Library of Congress and at the George Eastman House, Rochester, New York.Ashes of Vengeance at the SilentEra Plot At the ball celebrating the wedding of Henry of Navarre on August 23, 1572, the evil Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici (Josephine Crowell) persuades her son King Charles IX to sign a decree to exterminate the Huguenots. Meanwhile, at that same ball the Comte de la Roche (Courtenay Foote) puts the moves on Margot de Vaincoire (Betty Francisco), fiancée of Rupert de Vrieac (Conway Tearle). The de la Roches and de Vrieacs have been enemies for years and Rupert challenges the Comte to a duel. In their duel Rupert wins, but spares the Comte’s life so he will be obligated to him. Rupert and Margot are Huguenots while the Comte is a Catholic of the Queen Mother’s party. The Comte is sent to kill Rupert, but instead takes him to Margot’s house, which he has put under guard so the mob can’t attack it. There the Comte says he will arrange to spare them both if Rupert will agree to become his servant for five years. At the pleading of Margot, Rupert agrees. The Comte takes Rupert to his castle where his two sisters Yoeland (Norma Talmadge) and the crippled Anne (Jeanne Carpenter) live. Yoeland despises him when she finds out who Rupert is. However, when a captured wolf escapes, threatening her and Anne, yet Rupert defeats it with his bare hands her attitude starts to soften. Yoeland goes to see her cousin Denise, who is being forced by her uncle Louis de la Roches into an arranged marriage with the Duc de Tours. Yoeland takes Rupert as her escort. However Denise loves Phillipe de Vois, who is a poor nobleman. Then Anton, Rupert’s servant brings word that Margot de Vaincoire has married someone else. The Duc of Tours (Wallace Beery) arrives for his wedding. Denise’s father is called to Paris, leaving the Duc in charge of his castle. The Duc is revealed as a drunken brute, terrorizing the serfs and trying to seduce both Yoeland and a servant girl, killing her guardsman lover. The castle guards determine to avenge their dead comrade, so Yoeland directs Rupert to protect the Duc since he is her uncle’s guest. Rupert and few men battle the castle guard. Father Paul, Denise’s confessor escapes and brings back Phillipe de Vois and his men to save them. During the fight Yoeland realizes she loves Rupert. However, when she finds a lock of blonde hair in his doublet, while nursing the wounded Rupert back to health she thinks Rupert still loves Margot. Yoeland stops the Duc from torturing the dead guardsman’s brother and lover who instigated the attack on him. Phillipe de Vois and Denise elope, which the Duc allows to happen, as he intends to threaten Rupert with blinding with a hot poker to force Yoeland to marry him. She agrees but the guardsmen save them. Rupert and the Duc duel, but the Duc is stabbed in the back by the lover of the guardsman he killed. At Yoeland’s request her brother releases Rupert from his oath and after Yoeland learns the blonde hair was from Anne’s doll that she gave to Rupert as a token, Yoeland and Rupert become engaged.

The Inventory was originally compiled in 1987, although it is a continually evolving list. From 1991 it was maintained by Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage, and is now updated by a dedicated team within Historic Environment Scotland. As of 2016 the Inventory includes over 300 sites across Scotland. Background Unlike listed building status, there is no statutory basis for the Inventory, and inclusion of a site on the Inventory does not offer any legal protection. However, under the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013, planning authorities are required to consult Historic Environment Scotland on \\"development which may affect a historic garden or designed landscape\\".Historic Environment Scotland Policy Statement (2016) pp.24–26, para 2.77 This is confirmed in Scottish Planning Policy, and the inclusion of a site on the Inventory is a material consideration in planning terms. Types of site The majority of the Inventory sites are estate or park landscapes associated with country houses. However, a wide variety of other types of site are included, including cemeteries, urban parks, and small gardens, where these are of historical significance. Examples include Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyll, Duthie Park in Aberdeen, the Balmoral Castle estate in Deeside, and Ian Hamilton Finlay's garden at Little Sparta in Lanarkshire. Site selection Sites are selected and graded based on seven value-based criteria. These are: *value as an individual work of art *historic value *horticultural, arboricultural, silvicultural value *architectural value *scenic value *nature conservation value *archaeological value Each site is assessed, on a scale of none--little --some--high--outstanding, for each criterion, using guidance set out in the Historic Environment Policy Statement.Historic Environment Scotland (2016) pp.58–59 Other parts of the United Kingdom Separate registers of parks, gardens and designed landscapes are maintained in the other countries of the United Kingdom: * The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England is maintained by English Heritage * The Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales is maintained by Cadw * The Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest is maintained by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency References * External links *Gardens and Designed Landscapes, Historic Environment Scotland Category:1987 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland"},{"id":"29549608","text":"Else Platform () is an elevated, flat-topped mass of rock at the north end of Jetty Peninsula, Mac.

At the time of the Independence of Brazil, it became a province of United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Captaincies were originally horizontal tracts of land 50 leagues wide extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Torsedillas meridian. At the time of colonial Brazil, the Captaincy of Pernambuco was one of only two prosperous captaincies (the other being Captaincy of São Vicente), thanks to growing sugar cane. During the early colonial period, it grew by acquisition of failed captaincies to the north. At its height, the Captaincy of Pernambuco included the territories of the modern states of Pernambuco, Paraiba, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará and the western portion of Bahia (north and west of the São Francisco River) having thus its southern border with Minas Gerais (the northwest end of Minas was the final part of the São Francisco River District: a Pernambuco Captaincy advanced a little further into the mining territory of present-day Bahia). In the years just before Brazilian independence, the captaincy was reduced by repartitioning of several previously merged captaincies, until today's state with the same name was left.  History  King João III of Portugal =Etymology= The name pernambuco is a Tupi Indian name for the coastal reefs found along the region's Atlantic shoreline. =Founding= According to the charter grant passed by D. João III on March 10, 1534, the donee of Pernambuco was Duarte Coelho Pereira, who was a distinguished gentleman in the Portuguese campaigns in India. The captaincy of width 60 leagues stretched between the Igaraçu River (a tributary of Canal de Santa Cruz southern portion) and the São Francisco River. He called it New Lusitania, after the poetic name for Portugal. :The text of the original grant letter in Portuguese can be read here The boundary to the north was the parallel marking the southern boundary of the Captaincy of Itamaracá; to the south, the Rio São Francisco far shore; to the west the Tordesillas meridian; to the east, the Canal de Santa Cruz and Atlantic Ocean. The captaincy originally included what is today the state of Alagoras. Upon receiving the donation, Duarte Coelho Pereira went to Brazil with his wife, children and many relatives. They landed on the shores of Santa Cruz canal, where there was a nucleus of settlement in the Porto dos Marcos. He advanced to the mouth of the Igaraçu River, Pernambuco, where he founded the village of the same name. He built the Church of Santos Cosme e Damião, the first in Brazil, giving the administration of the village to Afonso Gonçalves, and headed south. On a hill, he built a fort (Castelo Duarte Pereira), a chapel and houses for themselves and for the settlers, which became the settlement of Olinda, constituted a village by the Charter Act passed on March 12, 1537. The sugar mills of Duarte Coelho and his wife, and that of his brother-in-law Jerónimo de Albuquerque on the Beberibe River near Olinda, were the first in the captaincy. The small port of Olinda was negligible, with no depth to receive large vessels crossing the Atlantic Ocean. In turn, Recife, a town named by the first donee for its arrecife dos navios (reef or causeway ships - Recife was shielded by a long barrier reef) became the main port of the captaincy. Everything was organized to perform registration and donation of land, administration of justice, civil record- keeping, and defense against the Caetés and Tabajaras Indians. When Coelho died in 1554, he bequeathed to his children a flourishing captaincy. In Olinda, administrative headquarters of the captaincy, settled the civil and ecclesiastical authorities, the Jesuit College, the main monasteries and small dock Varadouro. In the late sixteenth century, about 700 families lived there, not counting those who lived on the plantations, which housed 20 to 30 residents. From land bordering the São Francisco River, Pernambuco expanded northeast along the Atlantic coast, much exceeding in width the 60 leagues established in the letter of donation. The captaincy reached 12,000 square leagues (376,000 km²), becoming the largest land area among all that the king distributed.Varnhagen, Francisco Adolpho de (1854-57) Historia Geral do Brazil. Rio de Janeiro: Laemmert =Gold and diamonds= =Province of Pernambuco= In 1821, the captaincy of Pernambuco became the province of Pernambuco in the Kingdom of Brazil. Its borders have remained relatively unchanged since that time, with the slight change of ceding the south bank of Rio Francisco to Bahia. Administrative evolution Portuguese coat of arms of Pernambuco Pernambuco (Captaincy of Duarte Coelho, from 1535). In 1799 it was divided into the provinces of Pernambuco, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraíba. In 1817 it was divided again into Alagoas and Pernambuco. It was governed by donatarios until 1576, when it began to employ capitaes-mors appointed by the donatarios. After the Dutch occupation ended in 1654, the Portuguese Crown took over administration. In 1716, the last donatario sold his rights back to the Crown, and Pernambuco became a Crown colony.Henige, David P.

In 1864 he laid claim to the property now called Dalgonally in North-West Queensland, and found evidence of Ludwig Leichhardt's final expedition. He subsequently led a party in search of Leichhardt, but died of fever during the search. Early years Duncan McIntyre was born in Scotland in 1831. He was the fifth child of James McIntyre and his wife Mary, they were a Gaelic agricultural based society. In 1839, he came to Australia with his father's eldest brother, Archibald, his Aunt Elizabeth and five of their children.Duncan McIntyre (1831–66), notes in Julia Creek Library, p1 A sixth child, Donald (who later settled on Dalgonally Station) stayed behind in Scotland and did not rejoin the family until 1851.Duncan McIntyre (1831–66), notes in Julia Creek Library, p2 Only sketchy details are known of McIntyre's youth. He married Mary Morris in Melbourne on 5 March 1862. At the time he was superintendent of Glengower, a property near Castlemaine owned by Donald Campbell, a brother of his Aunt Elizabeth. Evidence of Leichhardt In mid-1863 Donald Campbell financed a land-seeking expedition with McIntyre as leader. The impetus came from William Landsborough’s description of the Flinders River country in North-West Queensland. Landsborough had passed through the Flinders region in 1862 while searching for the explorers, Burke and Wills. McIntyre's party left Glengower and made for Mount Murchison (near modern day Wilcannia) on the Darling River, and then for Cooper Creek. The party consisted of Duncan McIntyre (leader), William Frederic Barnett (second in command), Albert, Charlie and Billy (aboriginals), and 25 horses and one kangaroo dog.William Barnett letter, p5 From Cooper Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria they followed the general direction Burke and Wills had taken in 1860. They returned from the Gulf following Landsborough's route along the Flinders River and then south along the Thomson River, and other rivers, to the Darling River. The entire journey lasted five months. Duncan McIntyre was successful in finding suitable grazing land near the Flinders River – it became known as Dalgonally – and he found something else of significant historical interest: evidence of Ludwig Leichhardt's third, and final, expedition of 1848 from which Leichhardt never returned. McIntyre sent a telegram to the Royal Society of Victoria from Swan Hill, the first telegraph station he reached on his way back to Glengower:Gill, J.C.H., The Diary of William Frederick Barnett…, p9 > 15 December 1864 > Found between Burke and Sturt tracks about 200 miles from Carpentaria two > old horses, and saw very old tracks of a party going south west. Also two > trees marked L about 15 years old. Leichhardt Search Committee When it became known that McIntyre had found evidence of Leichhardt, a group of Melbourne society ladies formed a committee, the Leichhardt Search Committee, and sought contributions for a new search. McIntyre was appointed leader, probably in May 1865, though he was unaware of his appointment – he was in the Queensland bush buying cattle to stock Dalgonally. With McIntyre somewhere in Queensland – and still oblivious of his new role as leader – the Leichhardt search party left Glengower on Monday, 3 July 1865, at midday. After his return from the Gulf, McIntyre's intention was to return north in the cooler months of 1865 and claim Dalgonally – but he would have to stock it with Queensland cattle because stock were prohibited from crossing the border with New South Wales. In late May 1865 he was in Queensland on his way to collect a mob of cattle on the Barcoo River, and from there to drive them to Dalgonally. But circumstances changed. In a letter to Donald Campbell dated 24 August 1865, McIntyre describes his movements:Exploration of Julia Creek District…, S.U. Browne, p253 > I have been up in Queensland and bought a lot of cattle from a station near > the Barcoo River. I started on May 27, passing through the Maranoa district. > After a journey of nearly 500 miles I arrived at the station to take > delivery. Everything was in great confusion. We had to put up cattle yards > before we could do anything – and no water where the station and yards were. > After a month’s hard work we got the cattle together and started them. I > intended to go a week with them to see how McLeod would shape. In a few days > I saw he was not capable of taking the cattle on alone, and as I would not > be able to continue with him (I had to return to the Darling River for the > horses) we drove the cattle back to the station and let them go again – for > the place had been deserted by the owners... On 12 July, McIntyre and McLeod left the station for the Darling River, arriving in mid-August. The letter continues: > ... I learned ... for the first time that I had been appointed leader of the > Ladies’ Leichhardt Search Expedition ... The camels and stores left here > yesterday [23 August] for Mount Murchison – 90 miles without water. I am > going up the river to get horses and to sell the rubbish they sent up. Had > they been the best horses in Victoria they would not be fit to go northward > after getting here in such a season as this. In late August 1865, with fresh horses and in drought conditions, the expedition led by McIntyre started from the Darling. It was to proceed to that part of the Flinders where McIntyre had seen traces of Leichhardt. Fresh stores could be obtained as needed from Burketown, the settlement recently established on the Albert River. Disaster near Curracunya On 5 October the party was camped at Curracunya Springs (near present day Dynevor), 240 miles from the Darling River and 200 miles from Cooper Creek. Five weeks later, after the party was forced to leave Curracunya, a disaster occurred. The true circumstances surrounding this disaster are not known. The available evidence suggests that the party could not find water at Cooper Creek and retreated. The party split in two: McIntyre and one other man moving ahead on camels and planning to return with water; the second group, led by Dr James Murray, coming along behind with the horses and stores. When the two groups met again, the expedition in its original composition was at an end: 66 horses dead in the desert, and stores and equipment scattered. In his diary for November 1865, Alexander Gray had this to say:Diary of Alexander Gray, p2 > 26th. Went to Cooper Creek, 45 miles no water. 27th. Came back. Got to a dry > hole at night. > 28th. Started to crawl and we made to save our own lives. Donald McIntyre, > Barnett, McCalman, Dr Murray, a Black Boy and I travelled until our horses > gave out. Dr Murray went on and left us. We let the horses go and we tried > to walk but we were not able, so we laid down for dead. When the cool of the > night came on we got a little stronger and we crawled along the tracks until > we met Belooch with a little water which gave us great ease. We walked into > camp about 10. Sixty hours without a drop of water, 86 hours without > anything to eat, 97 hours on half a Johnny cake... Cooper Creek Camp Several members of the party returned to the settled districts while McIntyre and the remainder of the party once again moved ahead to Cooper Creek. The whole of December was spent finding permanent water in Cooper Creek and collecting the scattered stores. By 14 January 1866 a stockade had been erected as protection against the aborigines. On 9 February the expedition left Cooper Creek with 12 camels, 5 horses, nearly two tons of stores and six men: Duncan McIntyre, John McCalman, William Barnett, Belooch, Welbo and Myola (three aborigines). They arrived at the Cloncurry River on Sunday 18 March. The tree marked with Leichhardt's initials on the Flinders River was about 60 kilometres distant in a south-easterly direction. For several days McIntyre and Welbo searched the Flinders River for other traces of Leichhardt but were unsuccessful. Death at Grave Hole Inscription on tree near McIntyre's grave, ca 1930 To make good the loss of equipment that occurred at Cooper Creek, McIntyre went to Burketown towards the end of April 1866. A fever of plague proportions was sweeping the town, thought to have been brought in by a ship, the Margaret and Mary. It was the wet season, the climate oppressive, there was a want of proper provisions and medicines, and resistance to the disease was low. On 21 May, McIntyre showed the first symptoms of the fever. Two days later, still unwell, he rode back to the base camp on the Gilliat River and died there on 4 June. He was buried on the morning of 6 June beside a waterhole now known as Grave Hole. The letters DM LE (Duncan McIntyre, Leichhardt Expedition) were carved into a tree near the grave. A section of this tree is now in the Duncan McIntyre Museum in Julia Creek. After McIntyre's death, W.S. Sloman took over as leader. Dalgonally Station (then occupied by Duncan's brother, Donald McIntyre) became the base for the expedition and several rivers were investigated in the search for Leichhardt. In the latter part of 1866 Sloman died. William Barnett (the same man who accompanied McIntyre on his first trip to the Gulf ) became the new leader. Starting in January 1867 and finishing in May, the expedition made a sweep of the country between latitudes 20° and 21° south, and longitudes 142° to 140° east. No evidence of Leichhardt was found and the search was terminated. Celtic Cross McIntyre's Grave in 1951 In 1918 a Celtic Cross was erected over McIntyre's grave. Ulick Browne Snr remembered the occasion:Exploration of Julia Creek District…, S.U. Browne, p259 > I am pleased to have witnessed in 1918 the arrival at Julia Creek of the > monument now erected at the Grave Hole, put there by the family, the > proceedings directed by Mrs Annie McKay.

Many designed landscapes take advantage of existing geographical features, emphasising them through the planting of woodlands, or the creation of artificial lakes. For example, the parklands created by landscape gardeners such as Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, are designed landscapes. They may also be more subtle, resulting from the enclosure of land, and the planting of functional woodlands such as shelter belts.

He is said to have attained considerable proficiency in painting without the help of an instructor. His first attempts were made in copying the landscapes of Jan Brueghel, Paulus Bril, and Willem van Nieulant, and he studied attentively the principles of perspective and architecture. He afterwards travelled through Switzerland to Italy, and, during a residence of some years at Rome, formed an ample collection of designs from the most picturesque views in the environs of that capital. He returned through Germany to his native country, and established himself at the Hague, where he died in 1703. His drawings are more esteemed than his pictures; they are purchased at considerable prices in the Netherlands, where they are found in the choicest collections.

Mathys Wulfraat Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His father, who came from Germany and was a language teacher and doctor, wanted his son to follow in his footsteps and sent him to Latin school. Young Mathijs had more interest in drawing than anything else and even though he was punished for drawing more often than studying, he went on collecting prints, drawings, and drawing utensils to keep up with his hobby. He met Abraham Diepraam who was visiting Arnhem and influenced the young amateur. Seeing that his son had already failed at two different schools, Mathijs father gave up and let Mathijs become Diepraam's pupil, especially since Diepraam had a good reputation in Arnhem and his paintings sold quite well there. When young Wulfraet within a short space of time became a successful artist in his own right, he moved to Amsterdam, where he was successful painting historical allegories and merry companies. He also learned to paint small portraits, which he sold while he was in Frankfurt. In Frankfurt he painted many travellers and important citizens. He reached a great age, and was able to teach his daughter Margaret his art, which she performed well. Houbraken was planning on devoting a page to her memory, but he never got around to it.

These conditions are used in many proofs of Kurt Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. They are also closely related to axioms of provability logic.  The conditions  Let T be a formal theory of arithmetic with a formalized provability predicate Prov(n), which is expressed as a formula of T with one free number variable. For each formula φ in the theory, let #(φ) be the Gödel number of φ. The Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions are: # If T proves a sentence φ then T proves Prov(#(φ)). # For every sentence φ, T proves Prov(#(φ)) → Prov(#(Prov(#(φ)))) # T proves that Prov(#(φ → ψ)) and Prov(#(φ)) imply Prov (#(ψ)) Note that Prov is predicate of numbers, and it is a provability predicate in the sense that the intended interpretation of Prov(#(φ)) is that there exists a number that codes for a proof of φ. Formally what is required of Prov is the above three conditions. Use in proving Gödel's incompleteness theorems The Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions, combined with the diagonal lemma, allow proving both of Gödel's incompleteness theorems shortly. Indeed the main effort of Godel's proofs lied in showing that these conditions (or equivalent ones) and the diagonal lemma hold for Peano arithmetics; once these are established the proof can be easily formalized. Using the diagonal lemma, there is a formula \\\\rho such that T \\\\Vdash \\\\rho \\\\leftrightarrow eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)). =Proving Godel's first incompleteness theorem= For the first theorem only the first and third conditions are needed. The condition that T is ω-consistent is generalized by the condition that if for every formula φ, if T proves Prov(#(φ)), then T proves φ. Note that this indeed holds for an ω-consistent T because Prov(#(φ)) means that there is a number coding for the proof of φ, and if T is ω-consistent then going through all natural numbers one can actually find such a particular number a, and then one can use a to construct an actual proof of φ in T. Suppose T could have proven \\\\rho. We then would have the following theorems in T: #T\\\\Vdash \\\\rho #T\\\\Vdash eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by construction of \\\\rho and theorem 1) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by condition no. 1 and theorem 1) Thus T proves both Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) and eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)). But if T is consistent, this is impossible, and we are forced to conclude that T does not prove \\\\rho. Now let us suppose T could have proven eg\\\\rho. We then would have the following theorems in T: #T\\\\Vdash eg\\\\rho #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by construction of \\\\rho and theorem 1) #T\\\\Vdash \\\\rho (by ω-consistency) Thus T proves both \\\\rho and eg\\\\rho. But if T is consistent, this is impossible, and we are forced to conclude that T does not prove eg\\\\rho. To conclude, T can prove neither \\\\rho nor eg\\\\rho. Using Rosser's trick Using Rosser's trick, one needs not assume that T is ω-consistent. However, one would need to show that the first and third provability consitions holds for ProvR, Rosser's provability predicate, rather than for the naive provability predicate Prov. This follows from the fact that for every formula φ, Prov(#(φ)) holds if and only if ProvR holds. An additional condition used is that T proves that ProvR(#(φ)) implies ¬ProvR(#(¬φ)). This condition holds for every T that includes logic and very basic arithmetics (as elaborated in Rosser's trick#The Rosser sentence). Using Rosser's trick, ρ is defined using Rosser's provability predicate, instead of the naive provability predicate. The first part of the proof remains unchanged, except that the provability predicate is replace with Rosser's provability predicate there, too. The second part of the proof no longer uses ω-consistency, and is changed to the following: Suppose T could have proven eg\\\\rho. We then would have the following theorems in T: #T\\\\Vdash eg\\\\rho #T\\\\Vdash Prov^R(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by construction of \\\\rho and theorem 1) #T\\\\Vdash eg Prov^R(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\rho)) (by theorem 2 and the additional condition following the definition of Rosser's provability predicate) #T\\\\Vdash Prov^R(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\rho)) (by condition no. 1 and theorem 1) Thus T proves both Prov^R(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\rho)) and eg Prov^R(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\rho)). But if T is consistent, this is impossible, and we are forced to conclude that T does not prove eg\\\\rho. =The second theorem= We assume that T proves its own consistency, i.e. that: :T\\\\Vdash eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(1=0)) . For every formula φ: :T\\\\Vdash eg\\\\varphi \\\\rightarrow (\\\\varphi\\\\rightarrow (1=0)) (by negation elimination) It is possible to show by using condition no. 1 on the latter theorem, followed by repeated use of condition no. 3, that: :T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\varphi))\\\\rightarrow (Prov (\\\\\\\\#(\\\\varphi)) \\\\rightarrow Prov(\\\\\\\\#(1=0))) And using T proving its own consistency it follows that: :T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#( eg\\\\varphi))\\\\rightarrow eg Prov (\\\\\\\\#(\\\\varphi)) We now use this to show that T is not consistent: #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#( eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)))\\\\rightarrow eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) (following T proving its own consistency, with \\\\varphi = Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) #T\\\\Vdash \\\\rho\\\\rightarrow eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by construction of \\\\rho) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho\\\\rightarrow eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) (by condition no. 1 and theorem 2) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) \\\\rightarrow Prov(\\\\\\\\#( eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) (by condition no. 3 and theorem 3) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) \\\\rightarrow eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) (by theorems 1 and 4) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) \\\\rightarrow Prov(\\\\\\\\#(Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho))) (by condition no. 2) #T\\\\Vdash eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by theorems 5 and 6) #T\\\\Vdash eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) \\\\rightarrow \\\\rho (by construction of \\\\rho) #T\\\\Vdash \\\\rho (by theorems 7 and 8) #T\\\\Vdash Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) (by condition 1 and theorem 9) Thus T proves both Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)) and eg Prov(\\\\\\\\#(\\\\rho)), hence is T inconsistent.

It is located west of Annan. The house was designed by Sir Robert Smirke for the 6th Marquess of Queensberry, and completed in 1820. It is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History The lands of Kinmount were granted to the Carlyle family in the 13th century, and acquired by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Queensberry, in 1633. The 4th Duke of Queensberry carried out extensive planting on the estate in the late 18th century. On his death in 1810 Kinmount passed to the 6th Marquess of Queensberry, who commissioned a new house from the English architect Sir Robert Smirke. The Greek Revival house was built between 1813 and 1820, with Smirke's assistant William Burn acting as executant architect. The stonemason was John Park, and stone was brought from Cove quarry near Kirkpatrick- Fleming. In 1896, The 9th Marquess of Queensberry sold Kinmount to Edward Brook, a wealthy English industrialist who had bought the adjacent Hoddom Castle estate in the 1870s. Brook commissioned alterations and extensions to the house from Dumfries architects James Barbour and J. M. Bowie. These included the roof balustrades and urns, and the service court to the north- west. The house was used as a hospital during both the First and Second World Wars. Between 1988 and 1998 the house was owned by Steve Ovett. The house is now owned by Kinmount Leisure Ltd, which rents out holiday accommodation with access to outdoor sports. The Kinmount and Hoddom estates are owned by the Brook family trust.

Version 1 The first generation of Feature Selection Toolbox (FST1) was a Windows application with user interface allowing users to apply several sub- optimal, optimal and mixture-based feature selection methods on data stored in a trivial proprietary textual flat file format. Version 3 The third generation of Feature Selection Toolbox (FST3) was a library without user interface, written to be more efficient and versatile than the original FST1. FST3 supports several standard data mining tasks, more specifically, data preprocessing and classification, but its main focus is on feature selection. In feature selection context, it implements several common as well as less usual techniques, with particular emphasis put on threaded implementation of various sequential search methods (a form of hill-climbing). Implemented methods include individual feature ranking, floating search, oscillating search (suitable for very high-dimension problems) in randomized or deterministic form, optimal methods of branch and bound type, probabilistic class distance criteria, various classifier accuracy estimators, feature subset size optimization, feature selection with pre-specified feature weights, criteria ensembles, hybrid methods, detection of all equivalent solutions, or two-criterion optimization. FST3 is more narrowly specialized than popular software like the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis Weka, RapidMiner or PRTools.PRTools By default, techniques implemented in the toolbox are predicated on the assumption that the data is available as a single flat file in a simple proprietary format or in Weka format ARFF, where each data point is described by a fixed number of numeric attributes. FST3 is provided without user interface, and is meant to be used by users familiar both with machine learning and C++ programming. The older FST1 software is more suitable for simple experimenting or educational purposes because it can be used with no need to code in C++. History * In 1999, development of the first Feature Selection Toolbox version started at UTIA as part of a PhD thesis. It was originally developed in Optima++ (later renamed Power++) RAD C++ environment. * In 2002, the development of the first FST generation has been suspended, mainly due to end of Sybase's support of the then used development environment. * In 2002–2008, FST kernel was recoded and used for research experimentation within UTIA only. * In 2009, 3rd FST kernel recoding from scratch begun. * In 2010, FST3 was made publicly available in form of a C++ library without GUI. The accompanying webpage collects feature selection related links, references, documentation and the original FST1 available for download. * In 2011, an update of FST3 to version 3.1 included new methods (particularly a novel dependency-aware feature ranking suitable for very-high- dimension recognition problems) and core code improvements.

It provides a collection of print, non-print, and electronic resources for the community. The Eastham Public Library is a part of the Cape Libraries Automated Materials Sharing library network on Cape Cod and the Islands. History In 1644, Eastham, Massachusetts was settled by Pilgrims who were no longer satisfied in the Plymouth Colony. The town's name was officially changed from Nauset to Eastham when the town was incorporated. Nevertheless, the official \\"creation\\" of Eastham's first library was not until February 11, 1878 when town meeting approved allotting $175 for a library. The Eastham library was first housed in a building on Samoset Road that also contained a general store and the Post Office. William H. Nickerson gave the land that the library still resides on to the Village Improvement Society (V.I.S.) in 1887. It took several years to build the library, but the trustees opened the building to the public on January 8, 1898. The V.I.S. eventually sold the library to the town in 1903 for one dollar. That same year, the library received $15,000 from the will of Robert C. Billings. In 1927, electricity was brought to the building and a toilet was installed in 1934. In 1961, the building was expanded to double its size in order to match the quickly growing town. Between 1961 and 1985, the year-round population of Eastham tripled and this meant that the library needed to expand as well. The library almost tripled in size and was opened to the public in July 1988. In 1999, the part of the library that was the original library was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a part of the Eastham Center Historic District. The original library is the front room of the current library that now holds the Reference and Local History collections. Today As of the 1988 addition, the library now has two floors. The lower level is divided into a children's room, a hall for young adults, a small multipurpose room, a staffroom, a restroom, storage, a conference room, and the Eastham Historical Society's archives. The top level holds the adult collection, which is composed of nonfiction, fiction, large print, audiovisual materials, and a magazine collection. There is a small reading room, public computers, two restrooms, and a reference/local history room as well. The local history section contains 1750 titles that reflect the town's long history and its position in history as one of the early settlements of the Mayflower pilgrims. Throughout the year, the library offers programs for adults, children, and teens. While the library is one of the lowest staffed libraries on Cape Cod, it stays open 5 days a week for a total of 38 hours. =Governance= The Board of Library Trustees is composed of three elected members who govern the library along with the library's director (an employee of the Town of Eastham) =Friends of the Eastham Library= For over 30 years, the library has received enormous support from the Friends of the Eastham Library. They provide the library with a volunteer corps of over 30 volunteers that the library heavily relies on in order to keep functioning. Most of the income of the Friends of the Eastham Library comes from membership dues and from book sales. The library received $32,000 from them in FY 2005 in order to purchase materials, furniture, books, and equipment. The money is also used to support programs for adults and children. =Quick Facts= Address: 190 Samoset Road, Eastham, MA Wireless: Available 24/7 because it is accessible from outside the library Archives: The Eastham Historical Society's archives are housed in the Vivian Andrist Room on the lower level and the public can access it by appointment.

The circulation was still 61,658. *In 1998, the library had 36,979 items in its collection and circulation was at 94,389. *In 2008, the library circulated 107,897 items (it has consistently stayed over 100,000 items since 2000) and it had 48,860 items in its collection. The future alt=The Eastham Public Library after a large snowstorm The library building is now over 20 years old and is not compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In 2005, the Board of Trustees and library staff began to look into expanding the library to meet the new needs of the ever-increasing Eastham community. They hope to demolish everything but the historic portion of the current library and build a building. The new building would be ADA compliant (important for Eastham's generally older population, especially) and energy efficient, with flexible spaces to provide a cultural center for the town to use as needed. The new library would also provide much needed space for new technologies and formats.

It was first performed at the Music Society (Musikforeningen) in Copenhagen on 27 April 1897 under the baton of the composer. Background Carl Nielsen was inspired to write Hymnus amoris in 1891 while on his honeymoon in Italy. He and his wife Anne Marie were both impressed by Titian's painting The Miracle of a Jealous Husband in Padua. After he had completed the score, his wife provided a drawing for the title page. On one of the copies, Nielsen wrote: \\"To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing; but if you continue to show your affection for me, I will strive to achieve a higher expression of the world's strongest force, and then the two of us together will rise higher and higher towards the goal, as we constantly aspire for love in life and in art.\\"Lisbeth Ahlgren Jensen, \\"Hymnus amoris\\", Cantatas 1, Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 10 November 2010. In February 1897, in a letter to the Swedish composer Bror Beckman, Nielsen explained: \\"I really worked with this idea for a year or two, but it was only in the summer that I managed to begin writing the music. On 27 December the piece was finished and on 23 and 25 March it will be performed at the Music Society (Musikforeningen), probably conducted by myself.\\" The text for Hymnus amoris, initially wrriten in Danish by literary historian Axel Olrik on the basis of Carl Nielsen’s own draft, was later translated into Latin by Johan Ludvig Heiberg. Nielsen justified his choice of Latin in a note on the score itself: \\"I think I can defend my choice of Latin by saying that this language is monumental and elevates one above over-lyrical or personal feelings which would be out of place where the object is to use a large polyphonic choir to describe such a universally human feeling as love. In addition, this language is more singable than Danish or German, and finally — as the most important reason — the textual repetitions are more tolerable in Latin.\\" Reception At the first performance of Hymnus amoris at the Music Society in Copenhagen on 27 April 1897 under the baton of the composer, the soloists were Tia Krëtma, Katie Adler and Viggo Bielefeldt. The programme presents the work with its Danish title Hymne til Kjærligheden (Hymn to Love), the Latin stanzas appearing alongside the Danish version in the programme. The reviews were generally good. Writing in Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann commented: \\"The young, talented composer, who yesterday evening also showed himself to be an energetic and assured conductor, has with this work indisputably risen many degrees in the judgment of the public. To a Latin text which depicts in short lines the stages of love in childhood, youth, manhood and old age, and finally ends as a hymn of praise in Heaven, Mr. Nielsen has written beautiful, natural and poetic music, which in its performance last evening could only have a directly appealing effect on the audience.\\" Berlingske Tidende’s H.W. Schytte commented specifically on the Latin: \\"The odd idea that a Danish poem should be translated into Latin to inspire our young Danish composer and our Music Society choir of young ladies and gentlemen at a time when Latin is close to being abolished in the learned schools, was something to which we at first had difficulty reconciling ourselves. But we hastened to drive away these reflections and found the idea in the text acquired by the composer attractive and well suited to a sufficiently gifted composer. We did not quite grasp the little instrumental beginning. It seemed to us that there was nothing to grasp, but with the first chorus our attention was immediately captured, and gradually we let Latin be Latin and listened only to the music, which maintained an interest that during the 25 minutes the piece lasted rather grew than diminished, despite the fact that the Brahms section had already given us much to think about.\\" Angul Hammerich writing in Nationaltidende was more effusive: \\"In his new choral work... (Nielsen) has become considerably more assured, more positive, more aware of his goals. He has therefore created a piece which as a work of art must be placed much higher than its predecessors.\\" Charles Kjerulf in Politiken was highly critical of the Latin, asking why Nielsen: \\"wanted his thoughts and visions appareled in the shroud of a dead language.\\" He continued: \\"Why on earth must this little true-born Dane Carl Nielsen, who just a few years ago appeared in an army band on Odense market-place, blowing the cornet or striking the triangle in military parades — why on earth does he need to have his feelings put into Latin to set a love-hymn to music? That is really not something he owes his fine, indisputable talent.\\" Music The 25-minute piece is divided into four sections:\\"Hymnus Amoris\\", The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Page.

Campbell, is a series of three lawsuits filed by U.S. Senate candidate, Joe Miller, in both federal and Alaska state courts, that dispute vote-counting methods and other procedures conducted by the Alaska Division of Elections relating to the November 2, 2010 general election. The first suit was filed by Miller in the U.S. District Court of Alaska on November 9, 2010,Miller v. Campbell (3:10-cv-00252-RRB, District of Alaska) That suit was directed at invalidating write-in ballots that did not perfectly spell the last name of Miller's opponent, Lisa Murkowski, or that did not reproduce her name as it appeared on her declaration of write-in candidacy. When he filed the suit, Miller also sought a preliminary injunction requesting a suspension of the hand count of all the write-in votes pending a final order of the federal court. The judge denied the injunction, stating that irreparable harm would not occur because disputed ballots could be kept separate for re-examination. Miller also filed a suit in State court on November 11, asking for voter rolls to compare to the number of votes cast in certain precincts, and to look for evidence of vote fraud. On November 19, the federal judge directed Miller to move his suit to State court for a determination of whether the Division of Elections was violating Alaska law, and he issued an order halting the certification of the election, pending the outcome of the litigation. Miller then filed his second State court lawsuit regarding the election in the Alaska Superior Court on November 22. All of Miller's claims were rejected by the judge on December 10. Miller appealed the ruling to the Alaska Supreme Court; they heard oral arguments on December 17 and have fast-tracked their decision-making. The federal court retained jurisdiction of the U.S. constitutional issues that Miller raised in his November 9 Complaint; namely, that when the State Division of Elections used a voter intent standard in counting write-in ballots, it violated the Elections Clause and the Due Process Clause. According to Miller, the State election statute should be strictly construed to prohibit the counting of ballots in a candidates' favor if the ballots do not exactly comply with the clear and mandatory language of the statute. The federal judge has indicated he will rule in an expedited fashion on any U.S. constitutional issues that remain after the ruling by the Alaska Supreme court. Background Incumbent U.S. Senator Murkowski, a Republican, ran as a write-in candidate in the November 2010 general election because she had been defeated by Miller in the August 2010 Republican primary. The largest number of ballots cast in the November election were write-ins which required a hand-count to determine the names written on those ballots. Federal lawsuit When Alaska's state Division of Elections announced that it would consider voter intent when reviewing the write-in ballots, Miller sued to prevent the counting of ballots that did not perfectly spell Murkowski's last name, or that did not reproduce her name exactly as it was stated on Murkowski's declaration of write-in candidacy, or that had penmanship issues. Miller claimed State law was very strict in this regard, and that all such ballots should be discounted. He claimed the federal court had jurisdiction saying that State election officials would be violating the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment by using a voter intent standard. On November 19, the court ruled against Miller's request for a preliminary injunction to immediately stop the write-in vote count, but allowed the lawsuit to continue. Alaska election officials said they counted votes that are misspelled if they are phonetic to Murkowski, claiming that Alaska case law including decisions of the Alaska Supreme Court supports this practice. The Alaska Department of Law asked the federal judge to dismiss the case because it is fundamentally concerned with a question of State law that can be decided in the State courts and suggested that Miller was forum shopping by taking an alleged violation of a State statute, and bootstrapping it into a violation of provision of the U.S. Constitution. On November 15 the Alaska Federation of Natives asked to be included in the lawsuit, claiming standing because if Miller received his requested relief, certain voters whom the AFN represents would be disenfranchised - namely members of the native population, non-native speakers of English, and people with disabilities that caused them to have shaky or poor handwriting. U.S. District judge Ralph Beistline rejected both AFN's and Murkowski's requests to intervene. Write- in count completed The Miller campaign had observers present during the count who questioned the validity of over 8,000 ballots. By the end of the counting on November 17, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, with about 8,000 of those votes challenged by Miller. At that point, even if all the challenged ballots were thrown out, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. Hoping to pick up additional votes, the Miller campaign demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that because Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection, Miller's should also have the same, individualized treatment. The Director of the Division of Elections replied that the State does not do recounts completely by hand; it uses optical scan equipment. State court lawsuits After filing the federal lawsuit, Miller began a second legal action against Alaska election officials, this time, in State court, asking to inspect and count signatures of voters in more than 30 precincts. In support of the suit, Miller provided affidavits that cited, among other things, a ballot box that was not secured, and signatures that appeared similar. On November 16, the State election authorities agreed to provide Miller with the requested information. The Associated Press noted that similar signatures could be caused by voters requesting and receiving aid in filling out ballots, and that the affidavits suggesting fraud had been mostly by Miller supporters. Shortly after, U.S. District Court Judge Beistline directed Miller to move his complaint to State court saying that the Alaska courts were in a better position than U.S. federal courts, to apply Alaska law to decide who won the election. But Beistline also said he would \\"review any constitutional issues that may exist once the state remedies have been exhausted\\". Miller then filed his second State case in Fairbanks where he lives, essentially repeating the allegations in his federal lawsuit Complaint, but adding new claims of vote fraud and bias. State attorneys succeeded in getting the case moved to the State capital in Juneau where the disputed ballots were being held and where the Alaska Division of Elections is located. The State also asked for an expedited ruling so that Alaska would not deprived of full representation in the upcoming Senate session. After briefs and oral arguments, Judge William Carey of the Superior Court in Juneau disagreed with Miller's arguments, saying that if the Alaska Legislature had intended that a candidate's name must be spelled perfectly to count, it would have written the law to say that. Carey also dismissed Miller's assertions of vote fraud and other irregularities as unfounded. Miller's campaign replied that Carey's ruling modifies State law, and renewed calls for a hand count of all the ballots cast in the election. =Appeal to the Supreme Court of Alaska= On December 13, Miller appealed the Alaska Superior Court decision of the prior week to the Alaska Supreme Court. Miller's appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 22, 2010. Discussion of constitutional issues in the media Writing in Slate magazine, election law analyst Richard L. Hasen said Miller's federal complaint involved issues that can arise in close elections, and noted the value of sticking to established rules so that election officials cannot manipulate the vote. However, he also noted that the question of whether the Alaska statute required perfect spelling was a matter of statutory interpretation, and that Alaska's Supreme Court has a long history of interpreting statutes in favor of the voters to avoid disenfranchisement based on technicalities. Hasen also noted that Miller's constitutional claims derive from a concurring opinion in the 2000 U.S. Supreme Court case, Bush v. Gore, and said that the Election Clause claim would fail \\"because it would mean that election officials could never come up with regulations\\". Hasen also believed the Equal Protection argument, which is based on inconsistent treatment of similar ballots by different election officials, would also fail because in Bush v. Gore different election officials in different counties reviewed the ballots, but in Alaska, only one person was judging all the contested ballots. Continuation After these events, a lawsuit was filed by supporters of Miller arguing that the state violated the Voting Rights Act by accepting misspellings on write-in ballots, using different counting methods for different types of candidates and by allowing voters to vote without showing identification. Alaska has taken the position that the lawsuit is moot and in any event beyond the statute of limitations. All of Miller's legal challenges eventually failed. The State of Alaska spent an estimated $100,000 defending itself from these suits, and pursued partial compensation from Miller, as well as proposing new voting rules regarding write-ins in order to prevent a recurrence.Epler, Patti Former Senate Candidate Joe Miller's write-in lawsuit cost state 100K Alaska Dispatch News, 1/25/2011 References External links * Miller v.

He studied at Roanoke College and Richmond College (now the University of Richmond), then went on to the Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Chicago. He served under General Robert E. Lee with the Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. Roberts became a missionary supported by the American Baptist Missionary Union, working among the Kachin people around Bhamo and Myitkyina from 1879 until 1913. On his arrival in Burma, Roberts obtained grudging permission from the Burmese king, Thibaw Min, to build a school and educate the Kachins. The king, a devout Buddhist, granted Roberts \\"land the size of a buffalo skin\\". Roberts bought a buffalo skin, cut it into thin strips and used it to measure out the mission compound. Although his wife soon died from Malaria, Roberts was to carry out his mission for 34 years. His daughter, Dora, and his son-in-law, John E. Cummings, also became missionaries to Burma. Roberts was followed by the Swedish-American missionary Ola Hanson, who arrived in 1890 and did much work in compiling a grammar and dictionary for their Jinghpaw language, and in translating hymns and the Bible into Jingpaw. In 1892 George J. Geis arrived, establishing a mission at Myitkyina, to the North of Bhamo.

The China Post has indicated that the village sprawls across 62 hectares (1,550 acres); a trip to the village offers visitors the chance to enjoy many educational and recreational riches and it easily requires an entire day to experience all the village has to offer. The village is an aboriginal theme park that is composed of three major areas: the Aboriginal Village Park, the Amusement Isle, and the European Garden. The outdoor atmosphere gives visitors a glimpse of aboriginal heritage in an authentic setting by depicting the villages and lifestyles of Taiwan’s nine main tribesKhatri, D. (April. 19, 2007).

All of the rides except the Gondola to the aboriginal village and the steam train are located in \\"Amusement Isle\\". = European Garden = The European Garden (traditional Chinese: 歐洲花園) is the largest European garden in Taiwan. Notable features are the gothic clock tower, the Roman fountain, the miniature train, and the Ritz palace. The garden itself has Aboriginal style patterns. = Aboriginal Village Park = The Aboriginal Village Park is the largest outdoor museum in Taiwan. It is composed of nine villages on the hillside above Amusement Isle, each representing a different aboriginal tribal community. The buildings were reconstructed based on fieldwork and blueprints drawn up by anthropologists in the 1930s and 40s. The aboriginal village employs Taiwanese aborigines from the nine tribes with whom the visitors can engage in living history. Activities include sculpting, weaving, pottery making, cooking, knitting, exercising, handicrafts making, playing, and dancing in the tradition of the aboriginal tribes. The village represents nine aboriginal tribal cultures; it is also an amusement park that features original cultural performances, architecture, traditional clothing, hand-made crafts, etc. There are music shows and craft demonstrations in the village’s Culture Square. The village also provides visitors with the opportunity to watch traditional show performers, which are all native aborigines, Taiwanese aborigines perform traditional dances representative of Taiwan’s aboriginal tribes. During the shows, the performers invite audiences to participate in onstage activities, which give audiences more opportunities to get close to them and be involved in the culture = Amusement Isle = The cable car Amusement Isle is the amusement park section of the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village. It is located between the culture village and the European gardens and serves as an access point to the culture village via the cable car. The park's current rides and attractions include: * Mayan Adventure (traditional Chinese: 馬雅探險). Taiwan's first suspended roller coaster. Built by the Dutch company VEKOMA for NT$600,000,000. * UFO Adventures (traditional Chinese: UFO歷險). Taiwan's tallest free-fall ride at 280 ft (85m). Built by Swiss company INTAMIN for NT$300,000,000. * Gold Mine Exploration (traditional Chinese: 金礦山探險). A log flume ride with a 50 ft (15m) final drop. Built by German company MACK for NT$1,000,000,000. * Caribbean Adventure (traditional Chinese: 加勒比海探險). A water coaster consisting of a backwards section and a final drop of 100 ft (30m). Built by German company MACK for NT$360,000,000. * Aboriginal Ropeway (traditional Chinese: 九族空中纜車). Taiwan's first cable car system. Transports visitors from amusement isle to the aboriginal village. Built by Austrian company DOPPELMAYR for NT$1,000,000,000. * Aladdin Square (traditional Chinese: 阿拉丁廣場). An indoor facility that houses various small attractions. Notable among these are Space Mountain (traditional Chinese: 太空山) similar to Disneyland's Space Mountain, and Hawaii waves (traditional Chinese: 夏威夷巨浪). Other attractions include carnival games and fair rides. = Cherry Blossom Season = The best time to visit the village is during the cherry blossom season. This is because the flower season gives an extra special appearance to the village. The blossom season is between February and March depending on the weather conditions. A travel guide website in Taiwan states that the Cherry Blossom Festival has been held since 2001 with a series of events, and this season attracts an enormous number of visitors. The village is centered on the hundreds of cherry trees and over 2,000 cherry trees, and every year in early spring around February to March, The Sun Moon Lake, which is located to near to the village, and the village are embraced by cherry blossoms in full bloom making the area have the most cherry blossoms in central Taiwan. Also, during the cherry blossom festival period, lamplights are placed on each of the cherry trees in the Formosan Aboriginal Cultural Village.Taiwan flower viewing season. (2013).

Spread over , the lake has a maximum depth of . It is one of five major water bodies in Hyderabad. After 1956 when Hyderabad became the state capital of the Andhra Pradesh, the city witnessed unprecedented population growth, industrialisation and agriculture using synthetic fertilizers and insecticides. Inevitably, untreated domestic sewage, solid waste and industrial effluents entered into the catchment area of this lake. In 2003, the Minister of Tourism for Andhra Pradesh announced that the lake and its surroundings would be developed at a cost of . As a part of this initiative, two sewage treatment plants with the capacity to treat 250 million litres of sewage a day were to be installed. In addition to this, tourism-centric facilities such as a boating facility in the lake, a children's park and a restaurant were to be taken up. The minister also announced that all construction activity on the lake bed were to be stopped. Soon after, city's civic agency Hyderabad Urban Development Authority took up the task of cleaning up the lake. Four years after the installation of the sewage treatment plant, the officials reported 95% of sewage being treated. With the groundwater conditions improved, migratory birds returned to the lake in big numbers. In 2007, park was developed alongside the lake at a cost of . The park featured sculptures, ornamental landscape, boating facility and an environment education centre. Citizens of nearby localities such as L. B. Nagar and Vanasthalipuram welcomed this development. It has last its charm now After the restoration, the civic agencies have taken necessary steps that the lake does not get polluted because of the annual immersion of Ganesh idols. In addition, steps were taken to curb unauthorised construction near the lake bed. However, by 2009, the filtration unit of the sewage treatment plant stopped functioning properly. As a result of this, the lake was getting polluted with domestic waste.

At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Dropull.Law nr. 115/2014 It is within the wider Pogoni region that stretches in both Greece and Albania. Poliçan was the municipal center of the former Pogon municipality in Albania. It is nicknamed \\"the Bride of the Pogoni region\\". History =Antiquity and Byzantine period= In classical antiquity the region was inhabited by the Chaonians, one of the three major Greek tribes that inhabited ancient Epirus. Polican was identified with the Chaonian settlement Politeiani () also known as Polyani (). The name appears to be borrowed from the nearby mountain Polyainos. Ancient coins depicting Alexander the Great have been unearthed in Poliçan.Hammond, 1967, p. 722 The ancient name has changed to the present form (Polyts(i)ani) during the Slavic invasion (7th-8th century).Giakoumis, 2009, p. 12 In the late Byzantine period (11th-15th century) two Christian Orthodox monasteries were erected next to Polican. After the Fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade (1204), Polican became part of the Greek Despotate of Epirus and refuge for various Byzantine noble families.Giakoumis, 2009, p. 141 =Ottoman period= At the period of Ottoman occupation, that started in mid-15th century, Polican enjoyed a privileged semi-autonomous status which led to economic and cultural flourishing. The settlement was included in the Koinon of Zagori, although geographically it was not part of the Zagori region, but belonged to the Pogoni villages.Giakoumis, 2009, p. 15 Religious festival next to the church of Saint Nicholas in Polican, 1931 In the early 16th century two significant church buildings were erected in the town: Saint Athanasius (1513) and Saint Demetrius (1526). Both of them display unique features of early post-Byzantine art.Giakoumis, 2009, p. 139 A Greek school was founded in 1672 by the local Orthodox missionary Sophianos next to the church of Saint Athanasius.Koltsida, 2008, p. 131 The school attracted also students from the nearby regions next to Gjirokastër (Zagori and Riza).Koltsida, 2008, p. 197 A second school started operating in 1750, sponsored by a local businessman and benefactor. Greek education was expanded with the foundation of two secondary level schools in 1866, in addition to a boys' and a girls' school in 1866 and 1874 respectively.Koltsida, 2008, p. 229 The local educational institutions became renowned to such a degree that their graduates were eligible for admission to any Greek college in the Ottoman capital Constantinople (Istanbul) without qualifying examinations.Koltsida, 2008, p. 235 The schools of Polican were financed by the local community and especially by local businessmen and benefactors as well as by the town's diaspora.Koltsida, 2008, pp. 281-285 =20th century= Polican and the rest of the settlements in the Pogon municipality became part of Albania in the 1920s. In 1940, when Axis Italy launched a failed invasion against Greece from Albanian territory during World War II, the town came under the control of the II Army Corps of the Greek forces. The Greek communities that reside in Pogon have a recognized minority status by the Albanian state.Tziovas, 2003, p. 196 A Greek elementary school is currently operating in Polican. Demographics In 1913 the population of Polican was 1,650 (Greek census).Koltsida, 2008, p. 100 During the interwar period it reached ca. 2,500 inhabitants that spoke Greek. but it decreased to 559 in 1989. Geography and culture Polican is located on the slopes of Mount Nemërçkë, from the Greek-Albanian border. It is the northernmost Greek speaking village within the Pogoni region, which is divided between Greece (40 villages) and Albania (7 villages). \\"With a population of 2,500 Poliçan is the largest village in the long-rift within the double range of Nemerçkë. The villages to the north-west are Albanian-speaking, while those to the south speak Greek as their mother tongue.

Derek McMinn is the author of Modern Hip Resurfacing (), published in 2009. Hip Resurfacing =Birmingham Hip Resurfacing= Prof. McMinn first began performing hip resurfacing procedures in 1991 using the McMinn Resurfacing. The rationale behind the procedure was that it would be a bone-conserving alternative to THR for patients with higher activity demands i.e. young patients with severe hip arthritis who are otherwise in good health. This would buy time until they reached an age at which they would be more suitable for a THR. THRs utilise small diameter metal-on-polyethylene bearings which have a high rate of dislocation and revision in this group of patients. Sir John Charnley originally developed the conventional THR in the 1950s, which proved to be one of the most successful operations in the world. In this procedure the 'ball' part of the hip joint (femoral head) and a portion of its neck are removed and the 'socket' part (acetabulum) is grated in preparation. These are replaced with an artificial ball and socket with a long stem in the thigh bone. This and other designs of THRs have since transformed the quality of life of millions of old patients with severe hip arthritis. Because these devices contained polyethylene as one of the rubbing surfaces, Charnley was justifiably very wary of using it in young patients. He warned against the use of a THR in any young patient unless there were other physical restraining factors which would stop her/him from getting back to high activity levels. True to his prediction when these THRs were used in young patients they failed early even in the best centres on the world, including Charnley's own centre at Wrightington Hospital in the UK. The Swedish Hip Register shows that in young patients, 19% of THRs failed 10 years after the operation and 67% had failed by 16 years.Henrik Malchau, Peter Herberts, Peter Söderman, Anders Odén, Department Of Orthopaedics, Göteborg University, Sweden., www.jru.orthop.gu.se Because these patients are young, early failure implies the need for repeated revision operations using progressively more invasive and more complex devices. It was therefore always attractive to surgeons to employ a bone conserving procedure in young patients initially. When they need a revision there is more useful bone preserved to fix the new device to. McMinn's technique of resurfacing employs thin (3–4 mm) metal surfaces to line the patients' own hip. In contrast to a THR, the femoral head and neck are retained in this procedure. These large diameter resurfacings match the patient's own anatomy. Because they do not contain polyethylene, these bearings wear at a much lower rate, provided they are manufactured according to specifications, and are implanted well. These allow the patients to return to higher levels of activity after the operation without the fear of early wear. Furthermore, because the devices have the same diameter as the patients' own, they are less prone to dislocation. Over the following years, McMinn further improved the design and operative technique, eventually developing the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR). The first BHR was implanted in July 1997, in Birmingham, England. Over the next few years its success spurred surgeons all over the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and many parts of Asia to start performing the procedure. On 9 May 2006, the FDA approved the BHR for medical use in the United States.FDA Approval for the BHR Following thirteen years of usage McMinn reports 96% success with his BHRs in all patients and all diagnoses. These resurfacings are particularly successful in young patients who are the worst group for THRs. His success rate of the BHR in this age group is 98% at 13 years. Several other series and national registers also show similar results of around 95% currently with the BHR. The 2009 Australian National Joint Replacement Registry reported a 95% success rate for the BHR.2009 Australian National Joint Replacement Registry Short Stem Hip Replacement =Birmingham Mid Head Resection= In the early 2000s, McMinn found that the results of the BHR are excellent in all types of hip arthritis except one. In a condition called osteonecrosis, in which the ball part of the hip joint suffers a loss of blood supply and becomes non-viable, the results of hip resurfacing are not good (less than 90% success 10 years after their operation). Osteonecrosis can occur from a variety of reasons including fracture of the femoral neck, or patients who received high dose steroids due to any medical condition or those suffering from alcohol abuse. In such patients the quality of bone in the femoral head (the ball part of the hip) is compromised and progressively crunches leading to a failure of resurfacing. For such patients with poor quality femoral head bone stock, who are unsuitable for a regular hip resurfacing, McMinn developed a conservative and more versatile metal-on-metal arthroplasty, the Birmingham Mid Head Resection (BMHR) device. The BMHR is demonstrating good medium term results in such high risk patients. Total Knee Replacement =Birmingham Knee Replacement= Derek McMinn describes himself as primarily a knee surgeon who digressed into hip surgery for a few years in the past couple of decades. His colleagues acknowledge him as one of the finest knee surgeons in the world. In addition to performing many complex primary and revision knee operations in the past three decades, he also designed and developed a revision total knee replacement (TKR) for extensive bone loss in the mid 1990s. Current evidence shows that although knee replacements survive almost as long as hip replacements, the outcome of available designs of knee replacements are not as good as hip replacements. While only 1 to 5% of patients with a THR or a hip resurfacing are unhappy with their outcomes in the early years, nearly 20% of patients who undergo a knee replacement are dissatisfied with their outcome. In an attempt to improve the functional outcome following knee replacements McMinn developed a high performance knee which closely mimics the movement, stability and function of the natural knee to a greater extent. The world- class laboratory where the BKR was bench-tested reported that of all the artificial knees tested thus far, the BKR generated the least volume of wear. Early outcomes with the Birmingham Knee Replacement (BKR) are very promising.McMinn, Derek. Novel Strategies for TKR, London Knee Meeting Presentation, 2010. Of course only time will tell if the long-term satisfaction of patients with BKRs match those with hip resurfacings. Career Derek McMinn went to Royal School Dungannon, Northern Ireland where he captained the 1st XV rugby team and represented Ulster Schools XV. He qualified from St Thomas' Hospital Medical school in London in 1977, having captained the 1st XV rugby team and won the Cheselden medal and 1st prize in surgery. He has practised as a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon since 1988. McMinn personally trains surgeons from around the world in operative techniques. He is frequently invited to lecture at academic conferences around the world. He was given the honour of delivering the Presidential Guest Lecture at the Hip Society Open Meeting during the 75th Anniversary Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in San Francisco in 2008. McMinn was also invited to deliver the 2008 Sir John Charnley Lecture at the British Orthopaedic Association and the 2008 Sir Robert Jones Lecture at the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York City, USA. In addition he has delivered guest lectures at conferences in various countries from Japan to Australia to the Asia Pacific Orthopaedic Association, the European Federation of Orthopaedic Societies, the American Academy, the Argentinian Orthopaedic Association etc. He has addressed the Select Committee of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom apprising the members of parliament and senior civil servants of recent developments and strategies of healthcare as it applies to orthopaedics. McMinn has published extensively on the topic of hip arthritis and several other related orthopaedic topics. Recently he released a book entitled Modern Hip Resurfacing, which covers the development of resurfacing; and describes in detail all the nuances of the operative technique, in addition to being a treatise on the whole subject of resurfacing and its effects. In 2009, in recognition of his contribution to the medical profession, McMinn was awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) Honoris Causa by the University of Birmingham. Bone samples investigation In March 2019 a routine pathology audit in Edgbaston Hospital discovered 20 pots of bones dating back to December 2018 in a storage area. The next day senior managers arranged for staff working for him to take the samples to the McMinn Centre nearby. An internal BMI Healthcare report found McMinn had no approval for research - required by the Human Tissue Act - nor had he carried out research on the material. The report said that the hospitals's executive director told McMinn at the start of July 2019, warning him that the hospital did not have a licence to store human tissue and that in future samples should be removed from the hospital on the day of surgery. The Care Quality Commission investigated a few weeks later and learned about the pots discovered in March. In August 2019 the CQC asked the hospital to confirm it had a licence from the Human Tissue Agency and that McMinn had obtained consent from patients. After this McMinn was asked to justify his actions. He emailed the hospital that month, admitting \\"the samples were to be used for research, that he had been collecting tissue for 25 years, that he obtained verbal consent and that he had several thousand labelled samples in formalin pots with the corresponding notes, X-rays and investigations\\". He was suspended that month by BMI Healthcare, who informed the General Medical Council and Human Tissue Authority, though there are no GMC restrictions on his licence to practice as of September 2020. McMinn admitted to keeping patient bones at his farmhouse in Worcestershire and his premises in Birmingham with full knowledge of his colleagues in BMI Healthcare. He said he was keeping the bone samples for his retirement, with hospital staff telling the investigation the samples had been intended \\"to keep his mind active\\". West Mercia Police confirmed that they had searched a private premises in Worcestershire while investigating an alleged breach of the Human Tissue Act after being referred to it by the Human Tissue Authority. The internal report was unable to verify the number of samples, though they were told by McMinn's staff that there were 5,224. On 39 September 2020 BMI Healthcare launched a helpline for his patients, listing the number on their website.

It was founded by Roel van Duijn and one of its objectives was to set up an alternative society based on Van Duyn’s ideas as stated in his book, De boodschap van een wijze Kabouter (The Message of a Wise Kabouter). Van Duyn for some time worked at an organic farm and asked the farmer if they were going to get a harvester. “No,” the farmer responded “Noisy machines chase away the kabouters, and we need them to keep our plants healthy.” That is why Van Duyn used this image. The Kabouters were an offshoot of Provo’s environmental White Plans and they proposed “Groene Plannen” (“Green Plans”), such as Roel van Duijn’s idea to have plants growing in boxes on top of cars and, if possible, to have the automobiles drive on sunken roadways so that pedestrians would only see a procession of moving greenery. Van Duyn actually introduced this plan as a motion before the Amsterdam City Council. The Kabouters were primarily from Amsterdam but were also active in about 35 Dutch cities. At the peak of the movement’s activity, around June 1970, about 500 people were attending the weekly open meetings, where plans and policies were discussed. A year later membership had dwindled to 20 people. The Amsterdam movement published 12 issues of the “Kabouterkrant” (Kabouter Newspaper) in 1970. The Kabouters attracted international attention when in June 1970 they won 5 of the 45 seats on the Amsterdam Gemeenteraad (City Council), as well two seats each on councils in The Hague and Leeuwarden and one seat apiece in Arnhem, Alkmaar and Leiden. Their leader in Amsterdam was Roel van Duijn, who was actually being reelected to the single seat in the City Council originally won by the Provos in 1966. The Kabouters had to decide whether to participate as a party in the national parliamentary elections, in May 1971 and the movement was divided on this issue. Many Kabouters felt that the electoral process was not anarchist and consequently they entered the elections divided, and lost. There was also disagreement among the five Kabouter members on the Amsterdam City Council. Two of them advocated the legalization of marijuana and smoked it even during sessions. Van Duyn disagreed with their tactic and also felt that it was not an important issue. These same two people threw a stink bomb during a City Council meeting, forcing the chamber to adjourn for an hour. The Kabouters' most famous activity was squatting empty buildings. Such liberation of unused empty buildings from speculative absentee landlords was supported by Dutch public opinion. The Kabouters also operated many stores, alternative clothing factories, farms.

Fusco began his career as a photographer for Look magazine, and was a member of Magnum Photos from 1973 until his death in 2020. Early life Paul Fusco was born in Leominster, Massachusetts, and started pursuing photography as a hobby at the age of 14. During the Korean War, from 1951 to 1953, he gained more experience while he worked as a photographer for the United States Army Signal Corps. He first studied at Drake University and in 1957 received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photojournalism from Ohio University. He then moved to New York City to work professionally as a photographer. Photography career Fusco first worked for Look Magazine in New York City. While working there, in 1968, he took what would become a well-known series of photographs of mourners along the route of Robert F. Kennedy's funeral train. His photography often documented social issues and injustices, such as poverty, ghetto life, the early days of the HIV crisis, and cultural experimentation across America. His 1966 photos of California's Delano grape strike documented migrant farmworkers' struggles to form a union, supported by Caesar Chavez. The photos were released as a book, with text by George D. Horowitz, titled La Causa: The California Grape Strike. Fusco moved to Mill Valley, California in the 1970s. In 1973 he became an associate of Magnum Photos and a full member a year later. Over the years, Fusco also contributed to such publications as Life, Mother Jones, the New York Times Magazine, Newsweek, Psychology Today, and Time. Fusco also worked internationally covering events in Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. In the late 1990s, he spent two months making photographs of the lingering effects of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Belarus, eventually published in the book Chernobyl Legacy, which featured a foreword by Kofi Annan. In the early 2000s, Fusco pursued a personal project he called \\"Bitter Fruit,\\" documenting the funerals of US service members killed in the Iraq War. He left Mill Valley for New Jersey in 1993, but later returned to California, in 2009, to live in Marin County. Death and legacy Fusco died on July 15, 2020, aged 89, in San Anselmo, California.Paul Fusco: 1930 – 2020, magnumphotos.com; accessed July 16, 2020. Many of his photographs are in the Magnum Photos archive currently held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Two hundred of his photographs of the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee and Chesar Chavez, taken during a farm worker's strike in Delano, California, are held by the Library of Congress, as are 1,800 Kodachrome slides taken in June 1968 from the funeral train carrying Robert Kennedy's body from New York City to Washington, D.C., for burial in Arlington Cemetery. \\"Robert F.

It shares experiences across Europe on the ways creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation can help improving people's lives – making cities better places to live, work and play. About =Background= With over 70% of Europe's population now living in urban areas, cities have a vital role in delivering economic and social well- being for Europe. A new generation of urban influencers and innovators is emerging which recognises that culture and creativity is central to addressing the challenges cities face. Creative Cities supports this new generation, providing opportunities to develop and share ideas which make Europe's cities better places to live, work and play. =British Council proposal= The British Council developed the Creative Cities project in 2007, in partnership with a range of cities and organisations active in developing innovative approaches to city policy. Individuals taking part in project events develop new skills and build new contacts across Europe. Cities which join the project network have an opportunity to establish competitive advantage for themselves and attract creative talent, and in so doing set the foundations for future economic growth. The Creative Cities project is running in the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia. =Short description= Creative Cities explores new ways to improve quality of life in cities by involving young professionals from various backgrounds. During the course of the project these young people will acquire knowledge, networks, skills and tools to give them more influence on decisions made about the urban environment they live in. This will enable them to make a difference on a range of issues such as: public spaces, arts and social activities, and cultural policy. The three core project strands are: Future City Game, Urban Ideas Bakery and Urban Forum. In addition to the three strands, the project provides platforms to enable young social innovators in Europe to keep in touch with the project and each other: an interactive website, a Facebook group, Twitter and an e-mail newsletter. In recent years, the concept of the creative city was increasingly used as part of national branding campaigns in Europe (e.g. Creative Britain) and adopted by cities and organizations. Amid this development, there emerge the so-called creativity indices, which outlined and measured various interpretations of creativity in cities and countries. These result in an extremely diverse range of activities and initiatives that contribute to the realization of the creative city model, which is aligned with the goal of the Creative Cities to discover social innovation, creativity, and new thinking to make cities better places to live in. Methods and tools =Future City Game= * Generates new ideas on how to improve the quality of life either in a specific area within a city, the city as a whole, or in response to the common challenges facing cities around the world. * A one-day or two-day event involving city inhabitants from diverse backgrounds, representing different disciplines and led by a trained games-master. * Uses a team based process, with a unique and innovative methodology developed by the British Council in partnership with CLES – Centre for Local Economic Strategies and Urbis – Manchester's Centre of Urban Life. =Urban Ideas Bakery= * Builds skills and shares experience on how cities 'bake ideas' – that is turn them into practical solutions. * A problem-solving and planning process that puts people at the centre of social innovation; it includes a two-day international event engaging social innovators and experts from across Europe and local community representatives. =Urban Forum= The urban forum consists of international conferences and workshops providing a forum for ongoing debate on the role that creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation play in urban development. In a report to the UK Parliament, it was said that this forum has also been engaging young politicians to explore issues emphasized in the Creative Cities initiative alongside issues that revolve around people, politics, and youth action. The urban forum also involves creative events which demonstrate new ways cities can inspire creativity in the community.

Nasal reconstruction with a forehead flap. Clin Plast Surg. 2009 Jul;36(3):443-59. In this operation a reconstructive surgeon uses skin from the forehead above the eyebrow and pivots it vertically to replace missing nasal tissue. Throughout history the technique has been modified and adjusted by many different surgeons and it has evolved to become a popular way of repairing nasal defects. History Probably the first nasal reconstructions using a forehead flap were performed by Sushruta in India during 600 to 700 BC.Menick FJ. Nasal reconstruction: forehead flap. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004 May;113(6):100E-11E. The method was introduced in Europe in the 15th century. The first English description of the Indian midline forehead rhinoplasty was published in the Madras Gazette in 1793 and later Carpue, an English surgeon, published his experience with two successful median forehead flaps in 1816. The classic median forehead flap supplied by paired supratrochlear vessels was popularized in the United States by Kazanjian in 1947, however, this flap was not optimal because it was not long enough. To solve the problem of the short median forehead flap, its design was modified so that central forehead tissue could be transferred on a unilateral paramedian blood supply. Indications A forehead flap is usually required if the nasal defect is larger than 1.5 cm, requires replacement of support or lining, or if it is located within the infratip or columella.Menick FJ. Nasal reconstruction. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2010 Apr;125(4):138e-150e. If the defect is small and superficial it can be resurfaced with a skin graft or it can heal by secondary intention. Limited alar defects can be resurfaced using a nasolabial flap, however, the amount of tissue available from the nasolabial area is limited and the flap is thicker, less vascular, and hair bearing in males. Nasal defects mostly result from excision of (malignant) skin tumours as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, keratoacanthoma, lentigo maligna, lymphoma, and sweat gland carcinoma.Mureau MA, Moolenburgh SE, Levendag PC, Hofer SO. Aesthetic and functional outcome following nasal reconstruction. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2007 Oct;120(5):1217-27. Other acquired nasal defects are usually caused by trauma, burns or sepsis. The forehead flap is known as the best donor site for repairing nasal defects because of its size, superior vascularity, skin color, texture and thickness. Especially the color and texture of the forehead skin matches exactly with the skin of the nose. This is why the forehead flap is used so much for nasal reconstruction. Principles =Vascularisation= Vascularisation of the scalp and forehead is supplied by the supraorbital, supratrochlear, superficial temporal, postauricular and occiptal vessels.McCarthy JG, Lorenc ZP, Cutting C, Rachesky M. The median forehead flap revisited: the blood supply. Plast Reconstr Surg. 1985 Dec;76(6):866-9. All these vessels are lined vertically and permit safe and effective transfer of the forehead flap on multiple individual vascular pedicles. The pedicle is the anatomic part that resembles the stem of the flap. The perfusion of the paramedian forehead flap comes from three sources: randomly, through the frontalis muscle and through the supratrochlear artery. Because the forehead flap is an axial flap with a pedicle containing its dominant vessel, the pedicle can safely be narrowed to 1 to 1.2 cm. =Flap design= Figure 1. Example of a paramedian forehead flap design Four types of flap design are historically described in literature: the median forehead flap, oblique forehead flap, sickle flap and vertical paramedian forehead flap. However, the vertical paramedian forehead flap based on the ipsilateral or contralateral supratrochlear vessels has become standard, because it has a low turning point, making it easy to reach the defect without using hair- bearing scalp. Also, primary closing of the proximal forehead is possible as a result of the narrow pedicle. Lateral nasal defects are usually closed with an ipsilateral paramedian forehead flap. Central nasal defects can be reconstructed using either a right- or left-sided forehead flap. The ipsilateral pedicle is closer to the defect than the contralateral pedicle, therefore the flap can be made shorter when using the ipsilateral side. Some experts suggest that a contralateral flap is easier to rotate, but this difference is minimal. The only problem with the contralateral flap is the extra length needed, not the difficulty of the technique. Most foreheads are at least 5 cm long, when measured from eyebrow to hairline. This is usually enough to resurface the entire nose using a vertical paramedian forehead flap design. Still, there are some short foreheads. A forehead is called short when it is shorter than 4.5 cm. When using the forehead flap on a short forehead, there are multiple ways to get the length that is needed. First, the turning point of the flap can be moved down, so that the base of the flap is closer to the nasal defect and a shorter flap can be used to reach the nasal defect. Second, the distal end of the flap can be placed within the hairline. The reconstructed nose will then have some hair on it, but it can be plucked, depilated or lasered. =Principles of aesthetic regional unit repair= Aesthetic regions are used to describe the normal features of the face. These regions (forehead, cheeks, eyelids, lips, nose and chin) are defined by skin quality, border outline, and three-dimensional contour. The nose has nine aesthetic subunits, which are most important for reconstruction of the nose. These subunits are: the tip, dorsum, alae, sidewalls, columella, and soft triangles. For an optimal aesthetic result, scars should be positioned between nasal subunits. If enlarging the defect will make the aesthetic result better, normal tissue within the subunit can be safely removed. For reconstructing any nasal defect, the contralateral side should be used as a guide. Templates of the defect should be made based on the healthy contralateral side. This is important for defining dimension, outline, and landmark position. If more than 50% of a convex nasal subunit (tip, ala nasi) is missing, resurfacing the entire nasal subunit is better than only resurfacing the defect. Ideally, nasal reconstruction is performed on a stable platform. Support and shaping by soft tissue sculpting should be accomplished before pedicle division. Concha, septum or rib cartilage grafts should be used for creating enough support and a good shape. A second repair can sometimes be required; causes are recurrence of cancer, new cancer or new trauma. A second flap can be harvested from the contralateral forehead after a prior vertical flap. If an oblique or angled flap was used during the first surgery, the second repair becomes more difficult. On one side the pedicle is destroyed and on the other side the forehead is scarred. This is another reason to use the unilateral paramedian forehead flap design. =Donor site closing= The donor defect after using a paramedian forehead flap is limited to the central-lateral forehead. The defect is closed as much as possible using a T-shaped scar. The adjoining tissues are pulled together vertically and horizontally. Often there is a persisting defect depending on the size of the flap. Any possible resultant defect is high in the forehead and left to heal by secondary intention. Eyebrow malformation can occur, but is usually avoided if this method is used correctly. Technique Figure 2. The nasal defect after adjustment to the aesthetical subunitsFigure 3. The full-thickness forehead flap is sutured into the recipient site during stage one The two most used forehead flap techniques are the two stage and three stage forehead flap. The forehead consists of multiple layers; skin, subcutaneous tissue, frontalis muscle with fascia and a thin areolar layer. Traditionally, the forehead flap is transferred in two stages, where the flap is thinned during the first stage to improve the aesthetic result, possibly jeopardizing its vascularity and increasing chance for flap necrosis. To overcome this problem, Menick described a three-stage forehead flap technique, where initially the flap is transferred containing all tissue layers, making it an extremely safe technique. Only during the second stage, the flap - which now acts as a delayed flap - can safely be thinned aggressively according to aesthetic needs. During the final stage the pedicle is severed, the flap is thinned further and pedicle and flap are trimmed and inset. This three stage flap is especially useful for reconstructing large defects, complex contour deformations, or lining defects, while the two stage flap is used for smaller and superficial defects. Figure 4. The result after stage 1, without initial thinning of the flap Figure 5. Situation before the second stage of reconstruction Figure 6. Elevation and thinning of the flap during stage 2 Figure 7. The healed excess soft tissue and cartilage have been sculpted to improve contour Figure 8. The thinned forehead skin is returned to the contoured recipient Figure 9. The end result after a three-stage forehead flap Before surgery all important landmarks and reference points must be identified and marked. Important landmarks are the hairline, frown lines, location of the supratrochlear vessels, outline of the defect, nasal and lip subunits. Then templates are made using the intact side of the nose to make a precise symmetric reconstruction of the nose. The template resembling the defect is placed just under the hairline and the vascular pedicle is drawn downwards into the medial eyebrow. The pedicle is based on the supratrochlear vessels and can be 1.2 cm wide. This way the flap design has been made. =Two-stage flap= First stage The flap is incised and elevated from distal to proximal. Distally, the frontalis muscle and subcutaneous tissue are excised, this is done for 1.5 to 2 cm. Then more downwards the disscection goes through the muscle and over the periosteum. When reaching the brow, all of the skin borders are incised and the flap is carefully released. As soon as the flap reaches the defect without tension further incision of the flap is stopped and the flap is inset into the area of the defect. This is done using a single layer of fine suture. Second stage The second stage is three to four weeks later, when the flap is well healed at the recipient site. At this stage the pedicle is divided, the inferior forehead is reopened and the proximal pedicle replaces the medial brow by an inverted V. The nose side of the pedicle is elevated superiorly with 2 mm of subcutaneous fat. If needed the recipient site can be altered to reach a better aesthetic result. The scar is eventually sculpted between the nasal subregions to create a satisfying aesthetic result. =Three stage flap= First stage The flap is incised and elevated over the periosteum from distal to proximal. The flap consists of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fat and frontalis muscle and is not thinned. When reaching the brow, all of the skin borders are incised and the flap is carefully released. The full-thickness flap is then sutured into the defect without tension. Second stage Three to four weeks later, when the full thickness forehead flap is well healed at the recipient site, the second stage begins. The skin of the flap and 3–4 mm of subcutaneous fat is elevated. The underlying excess of soft tissue is then excised and the remaining healed tissue is sculpted in an ideal nasal subunit. The flap is then resutured to the recipient site. Third stage This stage is completely identical to the second stage of the two stage forehead flap. =Revision= For an optimal aesthetic result a difficult nose reconstruction is often followed by revision surgery. There are different types of revisions: minor revisions, major revisions and reoperations. Revisions are done not sooner than eight months after completion of the primary forehead flap technique. Results The goal of nasal reconstruction is to look as normal as possible after reconstruction.Moolenburgh SE, Mureau MA, Hofer SO. Facial attractiveness and abnormality of nasal reconstruction patients and controls assessed by laypersons. J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2008 Jun;61(6):676-80. Epub 2008 Jan 25. The results of nasal reconstruction using the paramedian forehead flap are quite good, although some patients report functional difficulties. Airway passage difficulties, mucosal crusts, dry mucosa, and difficulties with smelling are uncommon. A minority of the patients reported snoring more often or having a spontaneous nose bleed more often. Difficulties with phonation are not likely to occur. The majority of patients are satisfied with function of the nose after reconstruction. Ideally, standardized semistructered interviews are used to assess aesthetic outcome after nasal reconstruction. Studies using these interviews showed that generally patients are very satisfied with the result although they reported aggravating of their nasal appearance compared to before surgery. Patients were especially satisfied with flap color match and shape of the nasal tip. Remarkably, patients scored subjective aesthetic outcome significantly higher compared to a professional panel.Moolenburgh SE, Mureau MA, Hofer SO. Aesthetic outcome after nasal reconstruction: patient versus panel perception. J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2008 Dec;61(12):1459-64. In comparison to the two stage flap, the three stage flap technique has shown better results, lower revision rates and more possibilities for use of skin grafts for lining. Most likely this is because of the reliable vascularisation of the three stage flap. Complications =Flap necrosis= Because of the flap's rich perfusion, flap necrosis is unlikely to occur. If it happens the result of severe ischemia is normally caused by excessive tension on the flap, a misidentification of past injury, nearby scar formation, fanatic inset to the recipient site or exaggerated flap thinning. To solve the problem, to keep the underlying cartilage from infecting and to stop the situation from getting worse, it is better to excise dead tissue at an early stage than to wait watchfully allowing the injury to heal secondarily =Infection= It is unlikely for the operation area to get infected. In this situation failure in aseptic techniques or necrosis of the lining are the main causes. Early discovery of infection is very important so complete debridement can take place before underlying cartilage is exposed. Chronically infected cartilage is cured by reelevating the flap and excising the infected parts. =Recurrence/ inadequate initial reconstruction= In some patients a new tumor develops in the skin injured by the sun or an old cancer can redevelop. In a few cases the result of the first reconstruction was not good enough. When this takes place the next step is to take away the old flap and redo the reconstruction. A second flap can be taken from the contra lateral side in most instances =Eyebrow malposition= The defect created at the donor site is usually positioned at the central/lateral forehead. The defect can be closed by pulling the different sides of the wound together in vertical and horizontal direction. If there is a resulting defect after closure it is situated high in the forehead and it closes by secondary healing. In spite of the fact that, as a result, the eyebrow could be distorted, this is usually avoided. As a result of a large initial defect, the flap has to be larger and the bigger the forehead defect will be. When there is a large resultant forehead defect it logically lies closer to the eyebrow. That is why there is a significant risk of superior eyebrow malposition, especially if a horizontal or oblique oriented forehead flap is used. Then the solution is to close the remaining defect with a skin graft. However a skin graft is esthetically inferior and will always look like a shiny, irregularly pigmented, mismatched piece of skin. Alternatively, secondary placement of a tissue expander in the forehead can be used to correct the eyebrow malposition and to excise the skin graft and primarily close the forehead defect.

Pring. A rate of change (ROC) indicator is the foundation of KST indicator. KST indicator is useful to identify major stock market cycle junctures because its formula is weighed to be more greatly influenced by the longer and more dominant time spans, in order to better reflect the primary swings of stock market cycle. The concept behind the oscillator is that price trends are determined by the interaction of many different time cycles and that important trend reversals take place when a number of price trends are simultaneously changing direction. Formula Four different rates of change are calculated, smoothed, multiplied by weights and then summed to form one indicator. : ROC1 = (Price/Price(X1) - 1)*100; : ROC2 = (Price/Price(X2) - 1)*100; : ROC3 = (Price/Price(X3) - 1)*100; : ROC4 = (Price/Price(X4) - 1)*100; http://search.cpan.org/~kmx/Finance- TA-v0.4.1/TA.pod#TA_ROC_(Rate_of_change_:_((price/prevPrice)-1)*100) Where price refers to current closing price and price(X1) refers to the closing price X1 bars ago. : KST = MOV(ROC1,AVG1)*W1 + MOV(ROC2,AVG2)*W2 + MOV(ROC3,AVG3)*W3 + MOV(ROC4,AVG4)*W4 Where MOV(ROC1,AVG1) refers to the AVG1 day moving average for ROC1 For short-term trends, Martin J Pring suggests the following parameters: :X1 = 10 :X2 = 15 :X3 = 20 :X4 = 30 :AVG1 = 10 :AVG2 = 10 :AVG3 = 10 :AVG4 = 15 :W1 = 1 :W2 = 2 :W3 = 3 :W4 = 4 The formula is built into, or can be included in, various technical analysis software packages such as MetaStock or OmniTrader. Implications =Entry rules KST Indicator= When KST crosses below its 9-day exponential average, short at the next day opening price. =Exit rules KST indicator= When KST crosses above its 9-day exponential average, close short position at the next day opening. Variations It can be calculated on daily or long term basis. The dominant time frame in the (KST)'s construction is a 24-month period, which is half of the 4-year business cycle. This means that the KST will work best when the security in question is experiencing a primary up- and downtrend based on the business cycle. KST interpretation KST can be interpreted in the ways mentioned below. The dominant time frame in the Know Sure Thing (KST)'s construction is a 24-month period, which is half of the 4-year business cycle. This means that the Know Sure Thing (KST) will work best when the security in question is experiencing a primary up- and downtrend based on the business cycle. =Directional changes and moving average crossovers= You’ve discovered how changes in direction are the way the KST triggers signals, but also that moving-average crossovers offer less timely, but more reliable signals. The average to use is a simple 10-day moving average. It is possible to anticipate a moving average crossover if the KST has already turned and the price violates a trendline. The KST started to reverse to the downside before the up trendline was violated. Since either a reversal or a trading range follow a valid trendline violation, it’s evident that upside momentum has temporarily dissipated, causing the KST to cross below its moving average. Traditionally, the MACD gives buy and sell signals when it crosses above and below its exponential moving average, known as the “signal line”. This approach isn’t perfect; the ellipses on the chart highlight all the whipsaws. As said earlier, the KST can also give false or misleading signals, as you can see from the April 2005 buy signal. It comes close to a couple of whipsaws, but by and large, it’s more accurate, even though the MACD often turns faster than the KST. =Overbought/oversold and divergences= The concept is that when the indicator crosses above and below the overbought/oversold zones, momentum buy and sell signals are triggered. Even so, you must wait for some kind of trend reversal signal in the price, such as a price pattern completion, trendline violation, or similar. The KST often diverges positively and negatively with the price. =Trendline violations and price pattern completions= It is possible to construct a trendline on the KST and see when it’s been violated, but not very often. When it does though, it usually results in a powerful signal.

They gave the name Filla (the tatters) to a larger island here, presumably for the ragged outline of the feature as shown on the Norwegian chart. In 1952, John Roscoe made a study of this area as revealed in aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946–47). He found that what the Norwegians had named Filla was in fact a cluster of small islands. He applied the name Filla Island to the largest of these as described.

It was focused around turbine 68 in the Derrybrien wind farm, and disrupted further construction. The landslide dislodged 450,000 cubic metres of peat after days of dry weather. While initially coming to rest 2.5 km away, it moved further three weeks later when rains came, entering the \\"Derrywee River\\" or Abhainn Da Loilioch, and eventually spilled 20 km away into \\"Lough Cutra\\". The lake was also the source of the townland of Gort's drinking water, and this caused disruptions to supply. An impact assessment on the wildlife within the lake determined that more than 50 per cent of fish in the lake had been killed due to this pollution, about 50,000 fish of all ages and species groups had perished. A smaller peat slide near turbine 17 had occurred prior to the main movement on the 16th but it did not result in the suspension of the construction of the wind turbine farm. In 2004, the engineering and construction companies (associated with the wind farm development) were convicted of being responsible for the pollution, while the charges against the wind farm company itself were dismissed. In 2008, the European Court of Justice ruled against the Irish government, noting that an environmental impact assessment should have been undertaken before the project was allowed to proceed.

Early life  He Learned to read and write from his father and brother. His family was not able to send him to the official school in Hmmein, entrusted to him attention to the task of herding the small herd of family property. He felt inside strong tendency towards other interests, so emigrated in 1934 to Tartus as his brothers Abdul Karim and Salman have already done. There he did not success neither in the work of commerce nor in the private schools he worked to establish with his brother Abdul Karim.  The first publications  He wrote his first article and sent it to the Egyptian magazine called \\"the guidance of Islam,\\" and it was published in 1935, he was only 19 years old at that time. In 1938, he published his first collection of poetry called \\"Alzfrat”. He also wrote under the heading \\"social literary collection of poems\\". This was one of the pioneers who have devoted a name independent of the divan (collection of poems instead of the label that was prevailing at that time as \\"person’s name\\" or \\"selections\\").  The main events and activities  In 1938 he joined the Institute of Islamic religious in Damascus (now the College of Sharia), and did not complete the study because of family circumstances, was married and had fathered. Out of the prevailing system of nomenclature in the naming, he named his daughters and his sons, accompanied by the change since the late 1930s. He worked in 1939 as chief editor of the newspaper \\"Voice of Truth\\" which was published in Lattakia. He settled starting from 1948 in his job of Justice continued until his retirement in 1974, turning on the job between Safita, Banias and Tartous. During that period, his name merged in the field of literary and cultural and devotes as one of the important poets of Syrian classical and well known in that period, participating in major poetry festivals were held like “Abu Firas al-Hamdani festival\\" in Aleppo, and \\"Sharif Razi festival \\" in Lattakia also contributed in the founding of Al Zahra charitable society of and Okaz literary forum in Banias. He participated in the founding conference of the Arab Writers Union in Damascus and contributed in several conferences. Union also sent him as a part of its cultural delegation to Germany in the early 1970s. He published several collections of poetry, including: Alzfrat, River of Beam, Dampness and Shades, Luminous Poems, on the Graves of Loved ones, Sababat.  Arguments  He entered at his early age, and his early cultural and literary life in the dialogue on the pages of some magazines, literary and intellectual with Suhail Idris and also with Albert Doumit. He also rebutted later in separate books on books by other writers such as Abu Musa Al-Hariri and Abdul Hussein Al-Askari.  Other topics of interest  He was interested in history and thought was of his research and books in this area: \\"Sufism dialectic and affiliation\\" which is considered as one of the important researches in this field, as he chronicled to the village of Hmmein, and he searched in an analytical and historical reading, and anthropological approach to the life and travels of poet mystic \\"Almkazhon Alsnjari\\" quoted through them, as hypotheses of the research, on whereabouts of the tomb of this poet, where it is a place of disagreement. In addition to several books included articles in literary criticism, including: Spotlight, Attitudes and Emotions.  Death  He died Monday morning, the fifth of July in 2010 after living all his lifelong-lasting in the reluctance of worship voluntarily at the altar of the word conscious and meaningful in order to enrich the Arabic library authorship of value and he got what he wanted in the end result of devotion to the message of literature and thought.

Antarctic Specially Protected Area The island has been designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 109) mainly for its biological values, especially the banks of Chorisodontium–Polytrichum moss turf and Andreaea–Usnea fellfield. The cryptogamic flora is diverse, though in places the moss turf is subject to damage by Antarctic fur seals. The mites Stereotydeus villosus and Gamasellus racovitzai, as well as the springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus, are common beneath stones. Important Bird Area Moe Island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of seabirds. Some 11,000 pairs of chinstrap penguins were recorded in 1978–79, though subsequently their numbers have declined with only about 100 pairs present in January 2006. Other birds recorded nesting at the site include Cape petrels, Antarctic prions and snow petrels.
