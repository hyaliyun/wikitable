Since its inception, several spin-offs have been produced, including books, television documentaries, videos, music singles and an album. During the run up to the first episode of EastEnders, interest with the public was already high, something which continued afterwards. EastEnders proved as successful as was hoped for by the BBC in its first years, so they capitalised on it with a number of products. Books Many novels relating to EastEnders have been produced. Between 1985 and 1988, Hugh Miller wrote a series of 12 books focussing on several characters in the show. The books told the characters' backstories from before the show's inception in February 1985. Miller also wrote a series of four books called Teen EastEnders. Similar to the original 12 books, they focussed on teenage characters in the show. A further four novels were written by Kate Lock between 1998 and 2001. Two of these explored the backstories of the characters Grant Mitchell and Steve Owen, with the other two being \\"secret diaries\\" of characters Bianca Jackson and Tiffany Mitchell, giving an insight into the characters lives during storylines that were airing at the time. Several non-fiction books have been produced, including EastEnders: The Inside Story in 1987, which was written by the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. =Non-fiction books= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Author ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Publisher ! scope=\\"col\\"  ISBN - ! scope=\\"row\\"  EastEnders Special (1987 Annual)  Barraclough, John  1986  Grandreams  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  and Holland, Tony  1987  BBC Books  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Public Secrets: EastEnders and its Audience  Buckingham, David  1987   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Albert Square  Miller, Hugh and Harris, Keith  1987  David & Charles  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  EastEnders Special (1988 Annual)  Barraclough, John  1987  Grandreams  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  EastEnders Special (1989 Annual)  Lynch, Tony and Bain, Morag  1988  Grandreams  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  How to Speak EastEnders : A Brief Glossary of Cockney Expressions   1988  Lionheart Television  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Daniels, Therese and Gerson, Jane (eds.)  1989   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Kingsley, Hilary  1991  BBC Books  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Dawson, Susanna  1993  Red Fox Books  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Monroe, Josephine  1994  Virgin Publishing  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  ' An update version of this book was released 2 November 1995, in a paperback format, .

They are also often used as a lead up for a character's return to the show or follow characters who have departed from the show in another setting outside the usual location of Albert Square. The first of these was CivvyStreet, which aired in December 1988. It was set in Albert Square during World War II and featured younger versions of some of the soap's characters. Other episodes include Dot's Story, Perfectly Frank, Ricky & Bianca, Pat and Mo and Return of Nick Cotton. Documentaries have also been produced, particularly for the 10th, 15th and 20th anniversaries of the show looking back at the history of the show's inception, its characters and storylines. A behind-the-scenes documentary, EastEnders Revealed, aired regularly on BBC Choice and continued on BBC Three after the closure of BBC Choice. The first episode was in October 1999 and the show continued regularly until October 2005, with a few episodes still being made after this. A series of documentary shows, similar to EastEnders Revealed aired from 2006. EastEnders Xtra was an interactive series available between February and May 2005 via BBCi. The soap has also produced a number of charity specials for Children in Need. Some notable episodes include: Dimensions in Time, a crossover with the science fiction series Doctor Who; \\"Pudding Lane\\", which relocates the characters to 1666 during the Great Fire of London; and \\"East Street\\", a crossover with the ITV soap Coronation Street). The charity specials are not considered canon. On 4 April 2015, EastEnders bosses announced plans of a new six-part BBC drama series featuring iconic couple Kat (Jessie Wallace) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). The series, Redwater, will follow the characters as they move to Ireland. Speaking at the time, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins commented: \\"In the next few weeks on EastEnders, viewers will witness several huge twists for Kat and Alfie Moon that will change their lives forever. Now is the perfect time to take two of EastEnders‚Äô most beloved and enduring characters out of their comfort zone as they head to Ireland to search for answers to some very big questions... My team here are very excited about creating a whole new drama that stands apart from EastEnders while taking our style of storytelling to a place of stories, myth, secrets and immeasurable beauty.\\" Internet and BBC Red Button EastEnders official website is located on the BBC Programmes website at www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m86d and is part of BBC Online, the official website of the BBC. It was previously located at www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders. The website formerly contained information on the cast and characters, games, news and interviews but only the character information and interviews are now available, but are no longer updated and are in the \\"archive\\" section of the site. The website was redesigned in 2007, with the new version going live on 20 April 2007. Another updated website went live in December 2009, to tie in with the show's 25th anniversary in February 2010. The site contained new features and was based on feedback from users of the website. Occasionally, a character in the show sets up their own website and these are sometimes created in reality, such as rudemasood.co.uk, godlypodly.co.uk, watchagrownmanrot.com and desperaterussianhousewives.co.uk. In October 2009, a spin-off series entitled EastEnders: E20 was announced. Conceived by executive producer Diederick Santer, it was developed \\"as a way of nurturing new, young talent, both on- and off-screen, and exploring the stories of the soaps' anonymous bystanders.\\" EastEnders: E20 characters are a group of sixth form students and it targets the \\"Hollyoaks demographic\\". It was written by a team of young writers and was shown on the EastEnders website in January 2010. A second series was commissioned for later in 2010, and a third series for 2011. An internet mini-series, Lauren's Diaries, began in 2010, featuring Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) and giving an insight into her thoughts and feelings. A second series started in April 2011. The episodes feature on the EastEnders website. Another mini-series on the internet, called The B&B;, started in 2012. The four-episode spin-off takes on the style of a fly-on-the- wall documentary, featuring Kim Fox (Tameka Empson), working at her bed and breakfast. Tamwar Tales ‚Äì The Life of an Assistant Market Inspector is a four- episode spin-off starting in 2013, featuring the character of Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Various other mini-episodes have appeared online and on the Red Button, showing extra scenes. These have included the two-part \\"Amira's Secret\\" from 2011, 2012's \\"Phil on Remand\\" and \\"Billy's Olympic Nightmare\\". Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright) and Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) were also at the centre of a Red Button episode, showing how they spent their Christmas together, entitled \\"All I Want for Christmas\\". EastEnders first audio drama, EastEnders: The Podcast, started on 28 November 2018, consisting of four episodes. Videos and DVDs The first EastEnders video, released on 22 September 1986, was EastEnders ‚Äì The Queen Vic, which looked at the major events in the lives of Angie Watts, Den Watts, Jan Hammond and Michelle Fowler, such as the birth of Michelle's baby, Vicki. The next video EastEnders ‚Äì The Den and Angie Years, released in 1994. It included all of Den and Angie's moments such as their second honeymoon. In 1998, EastEnders ‚Äì The Mitchells ‚Äì Naked Truths was released, which was put together by writers such as Simon Ashdown, Tony Jordan and Christopher Reason. This video looked back at some of the most memorable storylines of Phil, Grant and Peggy Mitchell. This was essentially a two-hander between Phil and Grant, set in The Queen Victoria public house, intercut with flashbacks. A 40 minutes VHS was released in 1993, entitled The Gill and Mark Story. The VHS was only available to education institutions and followed that story of Gill and Mark's HIV storyline. To celebrate 15 years of EastEnders, a special video, 15 Years of EastEnders, was released. The video included some of the highlights of the show, including Den serving Angie with divorce papers, Grant discovering his wife Sharon and his brother Phil's affair, Tiffany Mitchell's death and funeral, and Carol Jackson confronting her daughter Bianca over her relationship with Dan Sullivan. The first EastEnders DVD was Slaters in Detention, released in November 2003 and also available on VHS. It contained a special comedic episode of EastEnders starring the Slater family. It was written by Tony Jordan, who helped devise the characters. It began with the female members of the Slater family dressed up in school uniform for a local disco, and they end up in a police cell where they reflect on the events of their lives, such as Kat revealing that Zoe was her daughter and Little Mo's marriage to Trevor Morgan. It also includes outtakes and an alternative ending to Little Mo's trial. An interactive DVD game was released in October 2005, entitled \\"An A-Z Tour of Albert Square\\" exclusively through BBC's Reading and Writing (RaW) campaign on BBC Online. The DVD is hosted by Adam Woodyatt as he challenges viewers to answer questions to unlock classic clips from the shows history. A DVD entitled EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford was released on 8 February 2010 to coincide with the show's 25th anniversary. It focuses on the characters Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde) in the run up to their mother Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) wedding to their father Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Cast interviews and archive footage also feature. A DVD, The Best of EastEnders, was released in November 2018, featuring some of the show's most iconic moments from the last 34 years. Music releases The EastEnders theme tune was released on record in 1986 featuring the orchestra of the themes creator, Simon May. The tune was later turned into a song, titled \\"Anyone Can Fall in Love\\". The lyrics were created by Don Black, and it was recorded in 1986 by EastEnders star Anita Dobson, known as Angie Watts in the show. It reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, and Dobson appeared on shows such as Top Of The Pops and Wogan, to promote the song. A one-off album entitled The EastEnders' Sing-A-Long Album was released in 1986 on BBC Records. It featured most of the original cast and was an album of medleys containing well known cockney knees-up songs such as \\"Knees Up Mother Brown\\" and \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\". The record is notable for containing a Doctor Legg solo effort, performed by the actor who portrayed the character, Leonard Fenton. The album reached number 54 in the UK Albums Chart. Two songs from the show were released as singles. \\"Every Loser Wins\\" by Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. \\"Something Outa Nothing\\" by Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and Paul Medford (Kelvin Carpenter) reached number 12. Both songs were featured in a storyline where the characters formed a band called The Banned. In 1999, BBC Music in association with Telstar released a single with performances by Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) and Mike Reid (Frank Butcher). They came together to release the song \\"The More I See You\\", based on their characters' wedding. A version of the theme tune, called \\"Peggy's Theme\\", features on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP along with other EastEnders songs including \\"Anyone Can Fall in Love\\". Other merchandise One of the first products was a BBC EastEnders Knitting Collection pattern book which was released exclusively to high street store Woolworths in 1986. It contains many of EastEnders' characters at the time wearing the patterns shown in the book. In 1988, a board game titled EastEnders the Game was released based on the characters and setting of the show. This game has since been reproduced. Since then there have also been items such as an EastEnders fridge magnet featuring The Queen Victoria pub and a hand-painted ceramic teapot based on The Queen Victoria, which was designed by Anne Rowe. There has also been EastEnders the Arcade Game, which was published by Macsen Software in 1987. The game was available for the ZX Spectrum 48K. In the Xleague TV series, Wez and Larry's Top Tens, it was voted the third worst video game based on a TV license of all-time. In November 2006, a wall calendar for 2007 was released, featuring pictures of the cast dressed as characters from William Shakespeare's plays, in aid of Children in Need. A range of EastEnders T-shirts were released through Topshop in 2010. In 2014 a wall calendar was commissioned to be sold in aid of Children in Need which shows some of the cast semi nude to link in with a storyline in the show itself.

Tanaka is an American former politician and a former law-enforcement officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He was convicted April 4, 2016, in Federal Court of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice. Tanaka served as Undersheriff of Los Angeles County from 2011 to 2013. He was also mayor of the City of Gardena, California. His tenure has provoked controversy due to allegations of violence, corruption, and alleged membership in the white supremacist police gang Lynwood Vikings. Personal life Tanaka was born at the Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles. At the age of 7, he and his family moved to Gardena, where he lived for 47 years. Tanaka received an accounting degree from Loyola Marymount University and was also a Certified Public Accountant. He served as Chief Financial Officer for the Go For Broke Foundation and the East West Players, and served on the board of the Harriet Buhai Center for Family Law. Tanaka was married to Valerie Tanaka, with whom he has 2 children. Elected official Tanaka was active in local government since his election to the Gardena city council in March 1999. In March 2005, he was elected mayor with 62% of the vote. He was re-elected to a second term in 2009. Law enforcement A career law enforcement officer, Tanaka initially joined the El Segundo police department in 1980. Transferring to the LA County Sheriff's Department (LASD) two years later, he rose through the ranks, earning his stripes in 1987, and making Lieutenant in 1991. Tanaka then rose from Lieutenant to Captain in 1999, Commander in 2001 and Chief in 2002.\\"County Facing Cuts to Budget; After forecasting a shortfall of $205 million in the general fund, the top official today will introduce a plan for a leaner 2003-04\\", Los Angeles Times, April 14, 2003 From January 7, 2005, to June 2011, he was an Assistant Sheriff. He is the first Japanese American in the position. He has been criticized for his affiliation with the Lynwood Vikings, a secret police organization and white supremacist gang brought to light amidst police misconduct litigation in 1990. Sheriff Lee Baca acknowledged Tanaka still has a tattoo related to the group, which a federal judge described as a \\"neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang.\\" Tanaka was tattooed as a member of the Vikings deputy gang in 1987, while serving as a Sergeant at the Lynwood station. On March 7, 1988, Tanaka was involved in a controversial killing of a Korean American in Long Beach, sparking outrage among Korean American community leaders. Hong Pyo Lee was shot and killed by Tanaka and four other deputies following a car chase. The deputies said Lee tried to run them over. The deputies were later found to have been justified in shooting by the district attorney‚Äôs office. Los Angeles County Undersheriff (2011-2013) Tanaka was appointed Undersheriff, the second-in-command at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in June 2011 by Sheriff Lee Baca. During his 2-year term as Undersheriff, the Department was dogged with several controversies. He announced his resignation on March 6, 2013. =Controversies= On October 18, 2011, at a Board meeting, Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Mark Ridley-Thomas held a motion to create a Citizens‚Äô Commission on Jail Violence with the mandate of reviewing the nature, depth and cause of Sheriff‚Äôs deputies‚Äô inappropriate use of excessive force in County jails and to recommend corrective actions. In early 2011, the FBI launched an undercover probe at the Men's Central Jail, to investigate allegations of corruption and abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division also launched a wide-scale pattern and practice investigation into allegations that Antelope Valley deputies discriminated against minority residents who receive government housing assistance. During Tanaka's tenure as Undersheriff, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit against Sheriff Lee Baca and top commanders, including Tanaka, for perpetuating a long-standing, widespread pattern of violence by deputies against inmates in the county jails. In September 2012, the Citizens‚Äô Commission on Jail Violence issued a final report that is very critical of the Sheriff Department‚Äôs management, including Baca, Tanaka and other executive- level staff, accusing them of fostering a culture in which deputies beat and humiliated inmates, covered up misconduct and formed aggressive deputy cliques in the county jails. Tanaka was in charge of the Department's Patrol Division and its budget. The report also called for the removal of Tanaka from the chain of command supervising the jail system, for statements that Tanaka had delivered, indicating that deputies could use excessive force against prisoners and that aggressive behavior would not result in discipline. The report also noted that Tanaka had accepted campaign contributions from many department employees, furthering perceptions of patronage and favoritism in promotion and assignment decisions. On March 6, 2013, Tanaka announced that he would retire as the Undersheriff, effective August 1, 2013, during an ongoing federal probe conducted by the FBI into widespread allegations of abuse, misconduct and mismanagement in County jails. Although his decision to resign was portrayed as being under his volition, Baca told Tanaka to step down because Tanaka had become a political liability. =Plot to hide informant= The plot to derail the federal investigation of the LASD supposedly began in August 2011, when Sheriff deputies retrieved a mobile phone from an inmate at Men‚Äôs Central Jail and were able to connect the phone to the FBI. Discovering that the inmate-turned-FBI informant was Anthony Brown, deputies had purposely hidden Brown from his FBI handlers, by moving him around different jails and changing Brown's name. =Criminal charges= On May 13, 2015, Tanaka was indicted on federal conspiracy and obstruction charges in the ongoing Los Angeles County Men's Jail corruptions investigation. Tanaka was the eighth LASD official to be criminal charged based on actions taken in the summer of 2011. =Conviction= On April 6, 2016, Tanaka was convicted on conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges by a federal jury in a case presided over by U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson. \\"The criminal charges centered on allegations that in 2011 Tanaka orchestrated a scheme to derail the FBI's jail investigation by intimidating the lead agent in the case, pressuring deputies not to cooperate and concealing the whereabouts of an inmate who was working as a federal informant.\\" As a result, Councilman Mark E. Henderson was appointed Mayor Pro Tem and served as acting Mayor of Gardena until the March 2017 election.http://www.cityofgardena.org/elected-officials-coucilmember- henderson/ =Sentencing= On June 27, 2016, Tanaka was sentenced to five years in prison, for civil rights abuses inside the nation's largest urban jail system. He was also sentenced to serve two years of supervised release after he is discharged from prison and pay a $7,500 fine. He faced a maximum of 15 years in federal prison. Tanaka planned to file a motion to sidestep his Aug. 1 jail surrender deadline and remain out on bail while he appeals his conviction. He surrendered Monday, January 16, 2017, to federal authorities in Colorado to begin serving the prison sentence at a minimum-security camp in Englewood, Colorado.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-tanaka- surrenders-20170116-story.html 2014 Sheriff's campaign On August 15, 2013, Tanaka announced his candidacy to unseat his former boss, Lee Baca, as the Sheriff in the 2014 election. Tanaka lost the election to Jim McDonnell, McDonnell received 49.4 percent of the vote and Tanaka received 15.1 percent to come in second.

It was the first commercial producer to specialize in bareback films as part of the emerging 1990s underground interest in the pre-condom era of gay porn that was concerned with the freedom of the sexual experience. The studio is named after Morris's favorite childhood book, Treasure Island. In addition to the original San Francisco office, TIM has production offices in New York, London and Mexico City. Motivation Morris said Treasure Island Media was established for \\"preserving the integrity of pornography and the honest representation of male sexual behavior. When I started producing porn, the genre had become depressingly corrupt, representing only a small subset of sexual behaviors [...] I wanted to capture the kind of sex that has meaning for me and I wanted to do so as accurately and honestly as possible. I also wanted to document the men. I wasn't interested in what they looked like, I was interested in what they understood regarding the complex behavioral language of sex among men.\\" He added, \\"Most recently, I've been motivated to produce pornography to directly address the appalling phenomenon of the HIV 'closet'.\\" Sales and popularity According to XBiz, TIM's best selling video to date is Dawson's 20 Load Weekend (2004), which stars Dawson.

When Ekman was forced to resign shortly before the elections in 1932 due to the Kreuger crash, Hamrin became prime minister. He resigned after the election because the Freeminded People's Party had suffered serious losses in the election. His term of office was only 50 days, giving him the record for serving the shortest amount of time as prime minister of Sweden. He served briefly as party leader for the Freeminded People's Party after Ekman, and in the newly formed People's Party until a new party leader was chosen in January 1935.

Brief history One of Canada's most influential alternative theatres, Theatre Passe Muraille (theatre \\"goes through walls\\") was founded in 1968 by director and playwright Jim Garrard, who started the company out of Rochdale College. Its radical intention was create a distinctly Canadian voice in theatre. It was conceived in the notion that theatre should transcend real estate; that plays can be made and staged anywhere‚Äîin barns, in auction rings, in churches, bars, basements, lofts, even in streetcars; and it was interested in the idea that theatre need not be a vehicle of social change, but rather it should endeavour always to be a mirror to social change. The company gained local notoriety when it was bafflingly charged with obscenity for the only mildly provocative play by American playwright Rochelle Owens, Futz (about a farmer who falls in love with his pig, but suffers the persecution of his intolerant neighbours). Jim Garrard was succeeded by Martin Kinch who had the job of artistic director for a year with Paul Thompson as technical director before he went on to found Toronto Free Theatre with John Palmer and Tom Hendry. It was under the Thompson's directorship in the 1970s that the theatre gained its national reputation. Thompson guided the company towards a distinctive style of collective creation with plays such as The Farm Show, 1837: The Farmer's Revolt and I Love You, Baby Blue. Other notable productions produced at Passe Muraille include O.D. on Paradise and Maggie and Pierre by Linda Griffiths; Fire by David Young and Paul Ledoux; The Stone Angel, James Nichol's adaptation of the novel by Margaret Laurence; Judith Thompson's The Crackwalker; and Lilies by Quebec playwright Michel Marc Bouchard. The company also had a major hit in 2001 with Michael Healey's play The Drawer Boy, which was based on actor Miles Potter's experiences years before while living on a farm to research and develop Theatre Passe Muraille's collective creation The Farm Show. Collective creation Thompson‚Äôs taking over the helm at Passe Muraille marked not only a turning point for the theatre but also a significant, even vital, step in the development of Canadian theatre as a whole. He brought with him the art of ‚Äúcollective creation,‚Äù a technique whereby plays were made by the actors themselves from their own experiences. The use of collective creation at Passe Muraille began when Paul Thompson, John Palmer and Martin Kinch found themselves with many ideas for shows but no scripts. It was a form with no roots in English-speaking North America. ‚ÄúThe collective-creation idea was inspired obviously by the Living Theatre,‚Äù said Paul Thompson, ‚Äúbut more closely by a company called Theatre d‚ÄôAujourd‚Äôhui ‚Ä¶There were a group of actors who had come out of the French section of the National Theatre School and were doing some very good improvisationally written shows and that sort of got me excited.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs far as going into a locale, the idea came from stuff I had been reading about China,‚Äù continued Paul Thompson, ‚ÄúThey went into areas and made stories about local heroes, they were traveling companies.‚Äù The Farm Show is arguably the most significant collective creation in TPM‚Äôs history. In 1972, Thompson and a group of actors went out into farming country around Clinton in southwestern Ontario. They lived with the farmers, worked with them, watched them and learned their stories. Then Thompson, who had been raised in farm country, literally forced his actors to create a play, each being responsible for his or her own part. It was part of an idea that became a theme for later work to help Canadians find new terms for heroes, to move away from the Davy Crockett types. The impact of The Farm Show was guaranteed by the fact that the community the show was built around saw it first and went crazy about it. The show premiered in the very barn the actors used for rehearsals. It was a terrific success and was taken on the road.Taylor, Bill. \\"Theatre Passe Muraille- A Short History.\\" October, 1982. Developing Canadian Theatre Since its inception, Passe Muraille has demonstrated its commitment to cultivating Canadian voices by mentoring and providing space and support to emerging theatre artists and fledgling theatre companies, in order that they may create on their own artistic terms. In 1973, Thompson started a production-oriented \\"seed-show\\" programme. During his term, Clarke Rogers started a script-oriented New Works programme and most recently, current Artistic Director Andy McKim opened the theatre's doors to anyone with new ideas for Passe Muraille's new Five-minute Pitch programme. Many successful alternative theatre companies developed within Passe Muraille's walls. Buddies in Bad Times, which is committed to supporting LBGT voices, the feminist Nightwood Theatre, Newfoundland's CODCO, Necessary Angel Company and the Blyth Summer Festival, amongst many others, all had their beginnings with TPM. Many of the country's most respected performers, writers and theatre artists, including Eric Peterson, David Fox, Mary Walsh, Rick Salutin and Linda Griffiths, consider Passe Muraille their starting point. Artists such as Ann- Marie MacDonald, Michael Ondaatje, Maria Campbell and Timothy Findley have all gone on to create original works that are considered Canadian classics.Theatre Passe Muraille: A Short History Theatre Space Theatre Passe Muraille's 1975 production of \\"I Love You, Baby Blue\\" was seen by over 26 000 people before it was closed by the police. Charges brought against the theatre for \\"immorality\\" were thrown out of court for lack of evidence. However, the success of this celebrated production was profitable enough for the theatre to put a down payment on a permanent home. This was an important event, as to this day, still only a handful of non-for-profit theatres in Toronto own the spaces in which they perform.With files from Theatre Passe Muraille, \\"The History of TPM from 1968-1996 Vol. III\\" Theatre Passe Muraille is located on Ryerson Avenue in the Alexandra Park neighbourhood of Toronto. The building was originally a bakery built in 1902 and has served several purposes over the decades. When TPM took the building over it had fallen under disrepair and large renovations were undertaken to bring the building up to the required standards. A second round of renovations began in 1983, the most important additions of which were the building of a large cruciform opening in the floor of the second storey and the installation of a lighting grid. The theatre houses two stages: the \\"Mainspace\\" which seats 185 and the \\"Backspace\\" which seats 55. The space was designated a historic building in 1977 by the Toronto Historical Board under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act, noting that, \\"the skillful use of brick and classical architectural design elements in the facade gives prominence in the neighbourhood\\" Artistic Directors *Jim Garrard (1968-1969) *Martin Kinch, John Palmer, Paul Thompson (1969-1972) *Paul Thompson (1972-1981) *Clarke Rogers (1982-1987) *Brian Richmond (1988-1990) *Layne Coleman (1991) *Susan Serran (1992-1996) *Layne Coleman (1997-2007) *Andy McKim (2007-2019) *Marjorie Chan (2019- ) Chalmers Canadian Play Awards 2000 The Drawer Boy by Michael Healey and Alien Creature: A Visitation from Gwendolyn MacEwen by Linda Griffiths 1997 Stuck by David Rubinoff 1995 The Alistair Trilogy by Nadia Ross and Diane Cave 1993 A Play About the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo by Alisa Palmer and Hillar Liitoja and The Stillborn Lover by Timothy Findley 1990 Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing by Tomson Highway 1989 Fire by Paul Ledoux, David Young and Otis Black Well 1986 Jessica by Linda Griffiths with Maria Campbell Notes External links *Official site *Theatre Passe Muraille at the Canadian Encyclopedia Category:Theatres in Toronto Category:Theatre companies in Toronto ","title":"Theatre Passe Muraille"},{"id":"2373406","text":"Benjamin Whitmer (born January 25, 1978) is an American professional wrestler, trainer and color commentator currently working for All Elite Wrestling as a producer. He is best known for his work in Ring of Honor (ROH) as wrestler and backstage producer, where he is a four time World Tag Team Champion. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2000‚Äì2005)= Whitmer was trained by Les Thatcher and debuted on January 23, 2000 in Thatcher's Ohio- based Heartland Wrestling Association. Whitmer feuded with \\"Ice Cream Man\\" Tony B. before forming a tag team with Jamie Knoble in 2002. On May 8, 2002 he won the Cruiserweight Championship by defeating Knoble, Shannon Moore and Matt Stryker in a four-man elimination match. He lost the title to Rory Fox on August 10. In addition to the HWA, Whitmer also began performing for Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. After being unsuccessful in winning the inaugural Sweet Science Sixteen tournament and then again in 2001, Whitmer won the now-renamed Ted Petty Invitational in 2002 as well as the Revolution Strong Style Tournament that same year. On April 9, 2004, he defeated Jerry Lynn in a thirty-minute Iron Man match for the Heavyweight Championship, which he held until May 29 when he was defeated by Petey Williams. In June 2001, Whitmer toured Japan with Pro Wrestling Noah, teaming on several occasions with fellow gaijins Matt Murphy and 2 Cold Scorpio. He was entered in the GHC Junior Tournament, but was eliminated by Tsuyoshi Kikuchi in his final match in Japan on June 21 in Toyama, Toyama. Whitmer toured with Noah once more in August and September 2005, losing most of his matches. His last appearance in Noah featured him in a three-way match for the ROH World Championship against Kenta and the then-reigning champion Nigel McGuinness. =Ring of Honor= The Prophecy and teaming with Dan Maff (2003‚Äì2005) Whitmer debuted in Ring of Honor in January 2003 at Revenge on the Prophecy. His first major match was a bout with CM Punk at Epic Encounter on April 12, 2003. The match was declared a no-contest after Punk gave Whitmer a German suplex off the ring apron and through a table on the outside, leaving Punk stunned and Whitmer concussed. Whitmer returned on May 31, losing to Dan Maff, and on June 14 he teamed with Punk's other enemy, Raven, to face CM Punk and Colt Cabana at Night of The Grudges. Whitmer and Raven lost when Cabana pinned Whitmer, apparently settling the issue. Whitmer regained some momentum with a victory in a four corners survival match on June 28 at WrestleRave, and on July 19 at Death Before Dishonor, he won another four corners survival match to become the number one contender for the ROH Championship on the line. Whitmer faced the reigning champion, Samoa Joe, at Wrath of the Racket on August 9, but was defeated. Between August and November, Whitmer took part in the Field of Honor event, where he won his block but lost in the finals to Matt Stryker on December 22 at Final Battle. That same evening, CM Punk confronted Christopher Daniels, Dan Maff and Allison Danger, members of The Prophecy, a heel stable led by Daniels, demanding to know which one of them had attacked and sidelined his girlfriend and valet, Lucy, earlier that year. A brawl broke out with The Prophecy on one side and Punk and Colt Cabana on the other. Whitmer then approached the ring and announced that he had been behind the attack, thus joining The Prophecy. The events on December 22 led to a match on January 10, 2004 at The Battle Lines Are Drawn between The Second City Saints (Punk, Cabana and Ace Steel) and The Prophecy (Daniels, Maff and Whitmer). The match descended into a brawl, and the referee declared it a no contest after Lucy returned to ROH for one night, slapping Whitmer to gain a measure of revenge. After the match, Punk injured Daniels (in reality, Daniels had signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) after performing the Pepsi Plunge through a table, marking Daniels' last appearance in ROH until June 2005. Whitmer and Maff continued to team together as The Prophecy, accompanied by Allison Danger, and feuded with the Saints throughout early 2004. They defeated the Saints for the Tag Team Championship at Round Robin Challenge III on May 15, but lost the title to the Briscoe Brothers later that evening. On June 12, 2004, at World Title Classic, Maff and Whitmer defeated three other teams in a thirty-five-minute-long ultimate endurance match. After the match, Maff convinced Whitmer to discard both The Prophecy's name and the managerial services of Allison Danger, claiming that they no longer needed a leader or a manager and resulting in both men turning face. Furious over this turn of events, Danger subsequently placed a bounty on the heads of Maff and Whitmer. They spent several months feuding with teams sent after them by Danger, including Slash Venom and Chicano and The Carnage Crew. On December 26 at Final Battle 2004, they defeated the Carnage Crew in a \\"Fight Without Honor\\", and shook hands with their opponents after the match. However, Whitmer injured his elbow in the course of the match, and was sidelined for two months. Whitmer and Maff captured the Tag Team Championship for a second time on February 19, 2005, defeating the Havana Pitbulls. Teaming and feuding with Jimmy Jacobs (2005‚Äì2006) Whitmer (left) with Jimmy Jacobs After Maff left ROH following a backstage altercation with Homicide, the title was vacated. Whitmer formed a new team with Jimmy Jacobs, and defeated Samoa Joe and Jay Lethal in a match for the vacant title on April 2. They lost the title to The Carnage Crew on July 9 at Escape from New York, but regained it two weeks later on July 23 at The Homecoming. The duo went on to lose the title again, this time to the team of Sal Rinauro and Tony Mamaluke, on October 1, 2005. On October 2, 2005 at Unforgettable, Whitmer and Jacobs joined manager Lacey to become the Lacey's Angels. On the ROH DVD release of Hell Freezes Over, a video segment piloted by Jimmy Jacobs revealed that Jacobs was in fact in love with Lacey. Focusing more on his love of Lacey rather than his effort in matches, Jacobs cost the Lacey's Angels team (also joined by Adam Pearce for the night) the victory at Tag Wars. Jacobs also cost himself and Whitmer the Tag Team Title the following night at Dissension against the champions Roderick Strong and Austin Aries. After this, Whitmer turned on Jacobs. It was also learned later on in the DVD release in a video segment that Whitmer quit Lacey's Angels altogether. Whitmer suffered an ankle injury due to Jacobs and was kept out of action, but appeared at Survival of the Fittest 2006 to attack Jacobs during his tag match with Colt Cabana against Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli. Along with Cabana and Daizee Haze, Whitmer began feuding with Lacey, Jacobs, and their hired enforcer Brent Albright in a series of violent matches, including one at Final Battle, where Albright put Whitmer through a table with a powerbomb. The feud continued into early 2007, and saw Whitmer perform an exploder superplex on Albright through a table in New York on February 16. The Hangmen Three (2007‚Äì2008) On February 23, 2007, Whitmer lost to Takeshi Morishima in a match for the World Championship in Dayton, Ohio. In September 2007, he allied with Brent Albright and Adam Pearce to form The Hangmen Three (also spelled as The Hangm3n), which later saw them gain Shane Hagadorn as their manager. While a member of The Hangmen Three, Whitmer challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on a number of occasions with either Pearce or Albright, but was unsuccessful in regaining the title. In March 2008, Albright and Pearce joined Sweet 'n' Sour Inc., prompting Whitmer to leave The Hangmen Three. Later that month, ROH announced that Whitmer had resigned from the promotion, praising his \\"immense contribution\\". =Retirement and return (2008, 2011‚Äì2012)= Whitmer in 2008 Whitmer retired from professional wrestling shortly after leaving Ring of Honor in 2008. However, Whitmer would make his return to the ring on March 19, 2011, where he returned to the Heartland Wrestling Association and defeated Gerome Phillips to win his second Heavyweight Championship, which he held until losing it to Jesse Emerson on August 27. The following month, it was announced that Whitmer was going to be taking part in Absolute Intense Wrestling's TPI tournament, not to be confused with the Ted Petty Invitational held by Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. He would be eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Tim Donst. On September 9, Whitmer made his debut for Dragon Gate USA, competing in a six-way elimination match, which was won by Brodie Lee. One week later, Whitmer returned to Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and defeated Bucky Collins to win the vacant Light Heavyweight Championship, which he held until losing it to Collins on October 14. Whitmer's first internet pay-per-view appearance for Dragon Gate USA took place on November 11 at Revolt, where he defeated Vinny Marseglia. Two days later at Freedom Fight 2011, Whitmer was defeated by Brodie Lee in a singles match. =Return to ROH (2012‚Äì2018)= piledriver onto the ring apron that Mike Bennett (left) executed on Whitmer (right) in 2013 resulted in Whitmer suffering a legitimate neck injury On February 17, 2012, Whitmer returned to ROH after a four-year absence, where he lost to World Television Champion Jay Lethal in a non-title Proving Ground match. After this, Whitmer allied himself with Rhett Titus to feud with Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team. Both teams competed against each other at Glory By Honor XI and a street fight at Final Battle 2012: Doomsday, where Whitmer and Titus lost both matches, the second of which saw Haas throw Whitmer into a table. As a result, Haas and Whitmer faced each other at the 11th Anniversary Show in a No Holds Barred match, which Whitmer won by referee decision. On May 18, 2013, Whitmer unsuccessfully challenged Jay Briscoe for the World Championship. On June 22 at Best in the World 2013, Whitmer defeated Mike Bennett and both subsequently began feuding with each other. On July 12 at Reclamation, Whitmer and the newly renamed Michael Bennett faced off in a rematch, where Bennett defeated Whitmer. August 3 at All Star Extravaganza, Whitmer entered a tournament for the newly vacant World Championship, where he faced Bennett in a first round match. However, the match ended without a winner after Whitmer was legitimately injured after being piledriven on the ring apron. On September 20 at Death Before Dishonor XI, Whitmer announced his retirement due to the neck injury he suffered from Bennett's piledriver. On December 14 at Final Battle 2013, Whitmer broke his retirement and teamed with Eddie Edwards in a winning effort against Jay Lethal and Roderick Strong. After the match, Whitmer turned heel by attacking Edwards with the assistance of Strong and former tag team partner Jimmy Jacobs. Whitmer then reunited with Jacobs and they both allied with Strong to form The Decade, with the stable's name being a reference to all three men's long tenures with the company. On the January 4, 2014, The Decade secured its first victory as Whitmer and Jacobs defeated Adam Page and Mark Briscoe in a tag team match. Whitmer successfully recruited Colby Corino, the 18-year-old son of Whitmer rival Steve Corino to join the Decade. This caused friction between Jacobs and Whitmer, feeling that taking Corino's son was too much, On March 27, 2015 at Supercard of Honor IX Whitmer defeated Jimmy Jacobs. Whitmer feuded with Adam Page after Page left The Decade. Whitmer faced Page at ROH 14th Anniversary Show, and defeated him. At Best in the World '16 Whitmer defeated Steve Corino in a Fight Without Honor with the help from Kevin Sullivan. Later Whitmer and Sullivan would align with Punisher Martinez.

It is distributed in the United States and Canada by Mango, a division of Island Records. All of the songs are in Haitian Creole. The following information is from the inside jacket of the CD : For thirty-five years, compas was the rhythm and the music to which Haiti danced. But in 1989, BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS introduced a revolution in Haitian music that helped to revitalize interest in Haiti's traditional culture and religion (Vodou). Their particular brand of dance music, Vodou Adjae, bridged the dancefloor and the Vodou temple, mixing influences from religious drumming and from the high- energy springtime festival called rara. Their message of unity, concern for Haiti's impoverished peasants, and intolerance for political corruption and neglect struck a chord with a country seeking identity and direction after a long period of political strife. The message was transmitted through an irresistible beat and BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS won both the contest for best song in Haiti in 1989 as well as the public imagination (and the sense of frustration with recent political events) is unmatched in modern Haitian history. BOUKMAN was the slave leader who helped to launch the revolution that led to the overthrow of French colonialism and the birth of the first black republic in the world in 1804. BOUKMAN was also a priest of the new Afro-Haitian religion called Vodou that helped to unify the Haitian slave to carry out the revolution. BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS captures the experience embodied in the image of BOUKMAN: a blend of African and Christian spirituality, stubborn resistance to oppression, and a fierce pride in the people, history and culture of Haiti.

June 1 is his Feast Day. Life A Vita was composed by an anonymous monk in the mid to late 11th century.Nikolic, Zrinka. Saints of the Christianization Age of Central Europe (Tenth-Eleventh Century), (Gabor Klaniczay, ed.), Central European University Press, 2013, p. 341 According to his Vita, Gaudentius was a native of Osor, where he later became bishop. Gaudentius was persecuted by other ecclesiastical leaders.Bunson, Matthew et al. \\"Gaudentius of Ossero\\", Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints, OSV Publishing, 2003 Falsely accused, he travelled to Rome in 1032 to defend his name. His request to abdicate his see was declined, and he was sent back with letters of approbation. On the way home, he fell ill in Ancona, and stayed there to recover. He then resigned his see in 1042, and became a Benedictine monk under Saint Peter Damian. He died in 1044 of natural causes. A church was built in his name in Ossero (today Osor) in the 14th century. It still currently holds his relics in the altar. The legend There is a legendary history of St. Gaudentius. It is believed that his reforms did not comply with the wishes of some noble men from Ossero, who took advantage of the instability within the papal state and attacked him. Bishop Gaudentius escaped and hid at the base of Mount Ossero. There he lived in a cave for one year. The cave was full of snakes and while he was repenting, he begged God for mercy to free these islands forever from poisonous snakes. He escaped to Rome and he continued with his penitential life in the Franciscan monastery in Ancona, Italy, where he died on May 31, 1044. One hundred years later, all the bells of Ossero began to ring by themselves early before dawn. Later, the citizens then found there was a wooden chest in the sea under the town wall. In it, there was another iron chest with the body of St. Gaudentius. He was proclaimed the patron saint of the town and the whole island. His remains are now in the altar of the church of his name.

The name also refers to the border post and bridge spanning the Limpopo River, which forms the political border between South Africa and Zimbabwe. Background The town lies just north of the Limpopo River about 1 km from the Alfred Beit Road Bridge which spans the Limpopo River between South Africa and Zimbabwe. The main roads are the A6 highway to Bulawayo and Victoria Falls, being 321km and 758km away respectively and the A4 to Masvingo and Harare. According to the 2002 population census, the town had a population of 22,387 dominated by the Venda and Ndebele people of this region. There is a small percentage of other people from other provinces because this is a busy border post with traders from all over Zimbabwe. The Beitbridge border post is the busiest road border post in Southern Africa, and is best avoided during busy border-crossing seasons.  Climate  The Town Beitbridge has an estimated 2,570 houses in formal settlements (primarily for government officials and mid-level private sector staff) and 3,000 in informal settlements. Formal-settlement dwellings are mainly two- to three-room brick houses, while those in the informal settlements are among the worst mud houses in Zimbabwe. The mud houses have since been demolished. Average house occupancy in the low-income and informal settlements varies considerably, as many people do not bring their families to Beitbridge, but includes at least four people. Recreational facilities are limited in low- income areas, consisting largely of bars and soccer pitches. Labour The major sources of local employment‚Äîfreight, retail, construction, customs and the police‚Äîemploy about 1,200 people. Informal sector activities‚Äîprimarily vending and sex work‚Äîare as large as those in the formal sector, employing about 1,400. Outside Beitbridge town, farming is a major employer. A diamond mine recently closed, increasing unemployment and poverty. Most women rely on vending, sex work and cross-border trading for income. Truckers are present in the area with work coming from the border area of South Africa. The Bridge The Alfred Beit Road Bridge is named after Alfred Beit, founder of the De Beers diamond mining company and business associate of Cecil Rhodes. He was also a director of a number of companies, among them the British South Africa Company and Rhodesia Railways. The original bridge was constructed in 1929 at a cost of $600,000 and financed jointly between the Beit Railways Trust and the South African Railways.New Alfred Beit Bridge is opened The Montreal Gazette, 2 September 1929 The new bridge was completed in 1995, and was officially opened on 24 November. It was built by the Zimbabwean Government, which now benefits from the tolls levied on crossings. The new bridge can accommodate much heavier traffic than the old one could, which is now for rail traffic only. Development Residents the town of Beitbridge, 2006 On the South African side of the border the N1 Highway connects this border post to the main economic centres of Pretoria (463 km) and Johannesburg (521 km). The closest town is Musina (16 km). On the Zimbabwean side of the border post the road splits in two, with the A6 running to Bulawayo and the R1 to Masvingo. A railway also passes through this border post, side by side with the road, and splits into a line to Bulawayo and a line to Gweru via Rutenga. Three railway lines meet at Beitbridge: the South African Spoornet line to Polokwane, the National Railways of Zimbabwe line to Gweru via Rutenga and the Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway. =Venue= Dulivhadzimu Stadium, a small multi-purpose arena in the town was chosen by the ZANU-PF led 21st February Movement to host the annual national celebration of Robert Mugabe's date of birth on Saturday, 23 February 2008.

He was also the leader of the conservative General Electoral Union (Allm√§nna valmansf√∂rbundet) between 1912 and 1935 as well as leader of Lantmanna- och borgarepartiet (a member party of the General Electoral Union) from 1913 to 1935, except for a short while during 1917 when he served as Minister for Foreign Affairs. His two tenures as Prime Minister, from 1906 to 1911 and from 1928 to 1930, spanned the introduction of parliamentarianism and universal suffrage. Lindman married Annie Almstr√∂m in 1888, with whom he had three children. He was a cousin of Alex Lindman. Biography Arvid Lindman was born in √ñsterbybruk, Sweden, the son of managing director Achates Lindman and Ebba Dahlgren. His career as a naval officer 1882-92 reached its peak in 1907 when he was appointed as Rear Admiral in the naval reserve. During his political career following this he became known primarily as \\"the Admiral\\". Lindman was CEO of Iggesunds Bruk from 1892 to 1903 and of Str√∂mbacka bruks AB between 1903 and 1923. In 1904, he also became Director-general of Televerket. In 1902 he had declined the post as Minister for Finance in Bostr√∂m's second cabinet but started a political career in 1905 when he became both Ministry for Naval Affairs (for the Navy and the Coastal Artillery) in Lundeberg's broad-based cabinet and a member of the Riksdag's first chamber. Staaff's liberal cabinet had hoped to instate complete suffrage for all draft-abiding male citizens under the first past the post system, with implicit support for women's suffrage as well; during the proposal Lindman was appointed Prime Minister at head of a moderate-conservative government. Through great political skill Lindman managed to enact universal suffrage for male citizens according to the principle of \\"double proportionality\\" - in both chambers of parliament - in 1907-09\\\\. His six-year government oversaw a number of reforms in the areas of industry, schools and social politics. A defence committee was appointed, decisions were made to build up the navy, and the international position of Sweden was confirmed in the Nordic and Baltic Sea agreements. Political and economic opposition resulted in the general strike of 1909, but the strike failed, and Lindman's government was allowed to remain in power, ostensibly supported by the king. Extended suffrage and proportional representation (under the d'Hondt method) had preserved the right as a parliamentary force yet contributed to a success for the left-wing coalition, when the Liberals and the Social Democrats won the election for the second chamber in 1911. Lindman transferred to the second chamber where he was chairman for the second-chamber right 1912-35, with an interruption in 1917 when he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Swartz's cabinet. As a leading right-wing politician he had given advice to the King about the creation of the Hammarskj√∂ld and Swartz cabinets, with the goal of blocking the more hard- edged conservative leader of the first-chamber right, Ernst Trygger. During the years 1913-35, Lindman was chairman for the national organisation of right-wing parties, the General Electoral Union - the predecessor of the present Moderate Party - and as such was a driving force in the work to modernize the party organisation, especially after the constitutional change in 1918 which instituted universal male suffrage. Among other innovations he hired an airplane to take him on speaking tours of the country and introduced the political poster. The GEU lost its status as largest party in 1917 to the Social Democrats, which has retained it since (with near-equal support for the parties in the general election of 2010). Proportional representation, however, managed to sustain a considerable support though surpassed by both Liberals and Social Democrats; with the single-member constituencies advanced by Staaff's Liberals had likely diminished all influence. After a hard-fought electoral campaign in 1928, when the Social Democrats had controversially formed a coalition with some Communists and suffered great losses in the election, Lindman formed a right-wing government in minority, after the liberals and the Freeminded (pro-Prohibition liberals) had turned down the King's request for a broader center-right majority government. Among the things this government did, the calling of the conference on peace in the workplace (a move to try to end frequent strikes and lock-outs) in 1928 is worth mentioning. The government resigned in 1930 after the Freeminded and the Social Democrats blocked the proposition for raised customs duty on grain, the goal of which was the strengthening of the agrarian sector. No party or union commanded a majority, which made the 1920s and early 1930s notoriously turbulent. Arvid Lindman (left) at the courtyard of Stockholm Palace as his second cabinet takes office in 1928. Lindman was a modern kind of party leader, who with involvement and eloquence turned directly to the voters. Both as an industrialist and as a politician he was energetic and goal-oriented. He was a pragmatic conservative without losing his principles and an effective political peace-broker, who sought a policy of compromise with his adversaries. During the growth of the anti-democratic movements in Europe he acted as a guardian for the principles of government by the people, and he spoke out strongly against nazism and fascism . When his party's youth organisation started organising uniformed fascist action groups in the 1930s, he saw to it that they were expelled from the party . The \\"honest thanks over the battle lines\\" from the social democratic leader Per Albin Hansson when Lindman resigned as party leader in favor of the younger academic and professor G√∂sta Bagge in 1935 was an expression of the wide-ranging respect that he had. Lindman died in an aircraft crash on 9 December 1936, when the Douglas DC-2 in which he was travelling crashed into houses near Croydon Airport just after taking off in thick fog.\\"The Croydon Disaster\\", Flight magazine, 17 December 1936, p.663 (online archive version) retrieved 2010-05-20.

He died March 1766 in Rocky Creek, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. He was the youngest son of Rev. Thomas Craighead and Margaret Holmes. He was the brother to my ancestor, John Craighead. Their mother was Margaret Holmes who was born in Scotland. She came with her husband and four of their five children from County Londonderry to America settling first in Massachusetts.

It is located near the geographical center of the city, south of Twin Peaks and Portola Drive and to the west of Diamond Heights and Glen Park. It dominates the southeastern view from most of Portola Drive. It is one of San Francisco's many hills and one of its original \\"Seven Hills\\". Mount Davidson's most notable feature, aside from its height, is the concrete cross situated on the crest of the hill. It is the site of a yearly prayer service, performed on Easter, when the cross is illuminated, and a yearly commemoration of the Armenian Genocide, held on April 24. Mount Davidson Park tops the hill ‚Äì excluding the land at the summit, which is privately owned. The parkland portion is located between Myra Way (east), Dalewood Way (southwest), and Juanita Way (north). Public transportation is provided by the 36 Teresita Muni line, which stops at the Dalewood Way and Myra Way entrance to the park. The residential neighborhoods around Mount Davidson Park are Miraloma Park to the east and Westwood Highlands and Sherwood Forest to the southwest.  History  Adolph Sutro purchased the land in 1881. After his death, the highest of the San Miguel hills was named \\"Mount Davidson\\" at the request of, and to honor, charter member \\"George Davidson, of the Sierra Club. Roster of Sierra Club Directors, Sierra Club, San Francisco, May 18, 2010 The appraiser for Sutro's heirs, A.S. Baldwin, bought the western slope of the mountain in 1911, along with much of the land immediately north and south of Mount Davidson. Baldwin began plans for development of St. Francis Wood, Westwood Park, Westwood Highlands, Forest Hill, Sherwood Forest, and Monterey Heights.  The cross  { class=\\"floatright\\" The cross atop Mount Davidson  } The first temporary cross was high, and erected in 1923 for a service led by Dean J. Wilmer Gresham of Grace Cathedral. A second high cross was built in 1924 and burned down in 1925. In 1926, a nearly high cross was built and illuminated every night a week before Easter, then burned down in 1928. In 1929 an high wood and stucco cross with lighting was built. The same year at the top of Mount Davidson was purchased by the city of San Francisco for use as a park with funds donated by the Mount Davidson Conservation Committee, led by Mrs. Edmund N. \\"Madie\\" Brown. Mrs. A. S. Baldwin donated a further on the summit to the city at the same time. Arsonists burned down the 1929 cross in 1931. In 1933 Mayor Angelo Rossi, Governor and former Mayor \\"Sunny Jim\\" James Rolph, the Easter Sunrise Service Committee, and the Native Sons of the Golden West pledged to construct a permanent cross to commemorate the early California pioneers. The high concrete and steel cross was completed the next year with President Franklin D. Roosevelt lighting the cross via telegraph from the White House on March 24, 1934 ‚Äì eight days before Easter. Sunrise services are held at the cross every Easter and were broadcast nationwide by CBS from the 1940s through the 1970s. (According to local gossip columnist Herb Caen, the original plans in 1934 called for a cross high, but there was \\"enough concrete on hand for an extra three feet ‚Äì so on it went.\\") Director Don Siegel filmed a scene from the 1971 movie Dirty Harry at the cross. Harry enters the park from Lansdale Avenue, an entry close to the Muni bus stop, before confronting Scorpio at the base of the cross. According to Warner Bros. literature, Siegel was pleased to discover the huge cross at Mount Davidson Park.Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry (Blu-ray promotional literature) Warner Bros Entertainment Inc 2008 However, the height of the cross and foggy weather made filming difficult. Every night for a month cinematographer Bruce Surtees would ride a crane to the top of the cross only to be hampered by foggy weather. When the weather finally cleared the shot was made in one night. The cross itself has been the subject of much debate among the residents of San Francisco as they have tried to weigh its religious role against its status as an historic landmark. In 1991 the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Congress, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State sued the city over its ownership of the cross. After a long legal battle and loss at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1997 the City auctioned of land, including the cross, to the highest bidder. The decision to sell the land was challenged by two members of the group American Atheists, but a federal appeals court ruled against them in 2002 and the Supreme Court declined to hear their case in 2003. The cross was purchased for $26,000 by The Council of Armenian American Organizations of Northern California which installed a bronze plaque at the base memorializing the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide. On Armenian Independence Day September 23, 2007, it was discovered that the plaque was missing. The original plaque was never found, and a replacement plaque was dedicated at a ceremony on April 20, 2008.

Indigenous peoples Pretty Nose at Fort Keogh, 1879 Archeological evidence has shown indigenous peoples lived in the area for more than 12,000 years. The oldest dated human burial site in North America was located in 1968 near Wilsall, Montana at what is now known as the Anzick site (named for the discoverers). The human remains of a male infant, found at the Anzick site along with Clovis culture artifacts, establish the earliest known human habitation in what is now Montana. In 2014 a group of scientists released the results of a major project in which they successfully reconstructed the genome of the Anzick boy, providing the first genetic evidence that the Clovis people were descended from Asians. Most indigenous people of the region were nomadic, following the buffalo herds and other game and living by seasonal cycles. Several major tribal groups made their home in and around the land that later became Montana. The Scout in Winter, Crow, 1908 by Edward S. Curtis The Crow, a Siouan-language people, also known as the Aps√°alooke, were the first of the native nations currently living in Montana to arrive in the region. Around 1700 AD they moved from Alberta to south-central Montana and northern Wyoming. In the 19th century, Crow warriors were allies and scouts for the United States ArmyRobert H. Lowie, The Crow Indians (U. of Nebraska Press, 1983) The modern Crow Indian Reservation is Montana's largest reservation, located in southeastern Montana along the Big Horn River, in the vicinity of Hardin, Montana. The Cheyenne have a reservation in the southeastern portion of the state, east and adjacent to the Crow. The Cheyenne language is part of the larger Algonquian language group, but it is one of the few Plains Algonquian languages to have developed tonal characteristics. The closest linguistic relatives of the Cheyenne language are Arapaho and Ojibwa. Little is known about the Cheyenne people before the 16th century, when they were first recorded in European explorers' and traders' accounts.E. Adamson Hoebel, The Cheyennes: Indians of the Great Plains (1978) The Blackfeet reservation today is located in northern Montana adjacent to Glacier National Park. Prior to the reservation era, the Blackfoot were fiercely independent and highly successful warriors whose territory stretched from the North Saskatchewan River along what is now Edmonton, Alberta in Canada, to the Yellowstone River of Montana, and from the Rocky Mountains east to the Saskatchewan River. Their nation consisted of three main branches, the Piegan, the Blood, and the Siksika. In the summer, they lived a nomadic, hunting lifestyle, and in the winter, the Blackfeet people lived in various winter camps dispersed perhaps a day's march apart along a wooded river valley. They did not move camp in winter unless food for the people and horses or firewood became depleted.William L. Bryan, Montana's Indians: Yesterday and Today (1995) The Assiniboine also known by the Ojibwe exonym Asiniibwaan (\\"Stone Sioux\\"), today live on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Northeastern Montana shared with a branch of the Sioux nation. Intermarriage has led to some of the people now identifying as \\"Assiniboine Sioux\\". Prior to the reservation era, they inhabited the Northern Great Plains area of North America, specifically present-day Montana and parts of Saskatchewan, Alberta and southwestern Manitoba around the US/Canada border. They were well known throughout much of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Images of Assiniboine people were painted by such 19th-century artists as Karl Bodmer and George Catlin. The Assiniboine have many similarities to the Lakota Sioux in lifestyle, language, and cultural habits. They are considered a band of the Nakoda, or middle division of the Sioux nation. Pooling their research, historians, linguists and anthropologists have concluded the Assiniboine broke away from the Lakota and Dakota Sioux bands in the 17th century. Early tribal treaty territories in Montana The Gros Ventre are located today in north-central Montana and govern the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Gros Ventre is the exonym given by the French, who misinterpreted the name given to them by neighboring tribes as \\"the people who have enough to eat\\", referring to their relative wealth, as \\"big bellies\\". The people call themselves (autonym) A'ani or A'aninin (white clay people), perhaps related to natural physical formations. They were called the Atsina by the Assiniboine. The A'ani have 3,682 members and they share Fort Belknap Indian Reservation with the Assiniboine, though the two were traditional enemies. The A'ani are classified as a band of Arapaho; they speak a variant of Arapaho called Gros Ventre or Atsina. The Kootenai people live west of the Continental Divide. The Kootenai name is also spelled Kutenai or Ktunaxa . They are one of three tribes of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation in Montana, and they form the Ktunaxa Nation in British Columbia, Canada. There are also Kootenai populations in Idaho and Washington. The Salish and Pend d'Oreilles people also live on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The smaller Pend d'Oreille and Kalispell tribes originally lived around Flathead Lake and the western mountains, respectively. The territories of the different tribes were defined by multiple and varied treaties with the United States, generally shrinking their land boundaries with each revision.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904. The Chippewa and Cree people today jointly share the Rocky Boy's Reservation in north central Montana. Rocky Boy's reservation was created after most of the others as a home for some of the \\"landless\\" tribes who did not obtain reservation lands elsewhere. The creation of the reservation was largely due to the efforts of the Chippewa leader Stone Child (aka \\"Rocky Boy\\"). The Little Shell Chippewa also have a presence in Montana, however they do not have a reservation. Other native people had a significant presence in Montana, though today do not have a reservation within the state. These nations included the Lakota, the Arapaho, and the Shoshone. The Kiowa and the Kiowa-Apache claim an early history in the late 17th century) as nomadic hunters between the Yellowstone and the Missouri.Boyd, Maurice: Kiowa Voices. Ceremonial Dance, Ritual and Song. Part I. Fort Worth, 1981. pp. 6 and 10. Louisiana Purchase From Frank Bond, \\"Louisiana\\" and the Louisiana Purchase. Government Printing Office, 1912 Map No. 4. On April 30, 1803, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed by representatives of the U.S. at Paris, France. The United States Senate ratified the treaty on October 20 and President Thomas Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on July 4, 1803. The area covered by the purchase included much of the present-day United States between the Continental Divide and the Mississippi River, encompassing the Great Plains including part of what is now Montana, particularly the Missouri River drainage. The rights to the Louisiana Purchase territory cost the U.S. $15 million, which came out to an average of 3 cents an acre. On March 10, 1804, a formal ceremony was conducted in St. Louis, Missouri, to transfer ownership of the territory from France to the United States of America. The lands of present-day Montana were practically unknown and too distant from the seats of power for this political boundary change to have much impact upon them, but the Louisiana Purchase would prove a sea-change for the area. Lewis and Clark Expedition The Louisiana Purchase sparked interest in knowing the character of the lands the nation had purchased, including their flora and fauna and the peoples who inhabited them. President Thomas Jefferson, an advocate of exploration and scientific inquiry, had the Congress appropriate $2,500 for an expedition up the Missouri River and down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. He had envisioned an expedition of this nature since at least the early 1790s, due to his driving interest to secure a route for the U.S. to trade interests on the Pacific coast. Jefferson tapped his personal secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead the expedition, and Lewis recruited William Clark, an experienced soldier and frontiersman who became an equal co-leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. They were to study, map and record information on the native people, natural history, geology, terrain, and river systems. The expedition floated up the Missouri River, making winter camp near the Mandan villages, east of the present border of Montana and North Dakota. The following spring, the Corps of Discovery ascended to the headwaters of the Missouri River, obtained horses from the Shoshone people to cross the Continental Divide, eventually floating down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. On the return trip heading east through present-day Montana, in July 1806, after again crossing the Continental Divide, the Corps split into two groups so Lewis could explore and map the Marias River and Clark could do the same on the Yellowstone River. While proceeding down the Yellowstone, Clark signed his name northeast of modern-day Billings. The inscription consists of his signature and the date July 25, 1806. Clark named the pillar after Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, nicknamed \\"Pompy\\", the son of Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who had helped to guide the expedition and, along with her husband Toussaint Charbonneau, had acted as an interpreter. Clark's inscription is the only remaining physical evidence found along the route that was followed by the expedition. In the meantime, Lewis' group descending the Marias met a small party of Piegan Blackfeet. Their initial meeting was cordial, but during the night, the Blackfeet tried to steal their weapons. In the ensuing struggle, two men were killed, the only native deaths attributable to the expedition. To prevent further bloodshed, the group of four‚ÄîLewis, Drouillard, and the two Field brothers‚Äîfled over in a day before they camped again. Lewis's and Clark's separate parties rejoined one another at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers on August 12, 1806. Thus reunited, and heading downstream, they were able to quickly return to St. Louis. During the trip, the expedition spent more of its time in what today is Montana than any other place. First settlements St. Mary's Mission was the first permanent European settlement in Montana. Through interactions with Iroquois between 1812 and 1820, the Salish people learned about Christianity and the Jesuit missionaries (known as \\"blackrobes\\"), who worked with Native tribes teaching about agriculture, medicine, and religion. Interest in these \\"blackrobes\\" grew among the Salish. In 1831, four young Salish men were dispatched to St. Louis, Missouri to request a \\"blackrobe\\" to return with them to their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley. The four Salish men were directed to the home and office of William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame) to make their request. At that time Clark was in charge of administering the territory they called home. Through the perils of their trip, two died at the home of General Clark. The remaining two secured a visit with St. Louis Bishop Joseph Rosati, who assured them that missionaries would be sent to the Bitterroot Valley when funds and missionaries were available in the future. Again in 1835 and 1837 the Salish dispatched men to St. Louis to request missionaries but to no avail. Finally in 1839 a group of Iroquois and Salish met Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The meeting resulted in Father DeSmet promising to fulfill their request for a missionary the following year. DeSmet arrived in present-day Stevensville on September 24, 1841, and called the settlement St. Mary's Mission.Smet, Pierre. Origin, Progress, and Prospects of the Catholic Mission to the Rocky Mountains. Fairfield, Washington: Ye Origin Galleon Press, 1972. Construction of a chapel immediately began, followed by other permanent structures including log cabins and Montana's first pharmacy. In 1850 Major John Owen arrived in the valley and set up camp north of St. Mary's. In time, Major Owen established a trading post and military strong point named Fort Owen, which served the Native people, settlers, and missionaries in the valley. Military history =Fort Benton= The first permanent settlement in Montana was Fort Benton, established as a fur trading post in 1847. It was named in honor of Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who encouraged settlement of the West. The U.S. Army took over the commercial fort in 1869 and a detachment of the 7th Infantry remained in the town until 1881. Its location on the Missouri River marked the farthest practical point upriver that steamboats could navigate. With the arrival of the first steamboats in 1860, the town of Fort Benton began to develop outside the fort's walls and developed into a major trading center over the next 27 years, until it was supplanted with the arrival of railroads in the Montana Territory. An original blockhouse still remaining in the largely reconstructed fort is the oldest building in Montana still on its original foundations, giving rise to the town's reputation as \\"the birthplace of Montana\\". =Fort Ellis= Built near the mouth of the Gallatin Valley, Fort Ellis played an important role in many of the early Indian conflicts in the territory. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry stationed here took part in both the Marias Massacre and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. It also provided a staging location for many missions of exploration and survey into the region that became Yellowstone National Park. =Fort Shaw= Fort Shaw was established in the spring of 1867 located west of Great Falls in the Sun River Valley. Two posts built at the time were Camp Cooke on the Judith River and Fort C.F. Smith on the Bozeman Trail in south central Montana Territory. Fort Shaw was built of adobe and lumber by the 13th Infantry. The fort had a parade ground that was 400 feet (120 m) square, and consisted of barracks for officers, a hospital, and a trading post, and could house up to 450 soldiers. The soldiers mainly guarded the Benton-Helena Road, the major supply-line from Fort Benton, which was the head of navigation on the Missouri River, to the gold mining districts in southwestern Montana Territory. The fort was decommissioned in 1891. The following year, 1892, the 20 buildings on the site were adapted for the Fort Shaw Indian Industrial School. The school boarded young Native people to assimilate them, teach them English, and educate them in modern technology; it had as many as 17 faculty members, 11 Native assistants, and 300 students. Montana Territory Swedish gold panners in 1860s Montana. The Montana gold rush began in 1862. After the discovery of gold in the region, Montana was designated as a United States territory (Montana Territory) on May 26, 1864 and, with rapid population growth, as the 41st state on November 8, 1889. Montana territory was organized from the existing Idaho Territory by Act of Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 28, 1864. The areas east of the continental divide had been previously part of the Nebraska and Dakota territories and had been acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. The territory also included land west of the continental divide, which had been acquired by the United States in the Oregon Treaty, and originally included in the Oregon Territory. (The part of the Oregon Territory that became part of Montana had been split off as part of the Washington Territory.) The boundary between the Washington Territory and Dakota Territory was the Continental Divide (as shown on the 1861 map); however, the boundary between the Idaho Territory and the Montana Territory followed the Bitterroot Range north of 46¬∞30'N (as shown on the 1864 map). Popular legend says a drunken survey party followed the wrong mountain ridge and mistakenly moved the boundary west into the Bitterroot Range. Contrary to legend, the boundary is precisely where the United States Congress intended. The Organic Act of the Territory of Montana defines the boundary as extending from the modern intersection of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming at: > the forty-fourth degree and thirty minutes of north latitude; thence due > west along said forty-fourth degree and thirty minutes of north latitude to > a point formed by its intersection with the crest of the Rocky Mountains; > thence following the crest of the Rocky Mountains northward till its > intersection with the Bitter Root Mountains; thence northward along the > crest of the Bitter Root Mountains to its intersection with the thirty-ninth > degree of longitude west from Washington; thence along said thirty-ninth > degree of longitude northward to the boundary line of the British > possessions. The boundaries of Montana territory did not change during its existence. Montana was admitted to the Union as the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Indian Wars =Battle of the Little Big Horn= The Battle of the Little Bighorn‚Äîalso called Custer's Last Stand and the Battle of the Greasy Grass‚Äîwas an armed engagement between a Lakota (Sioux)-Northern Cheyenne-Arapaho combined force and the 7th Cavalry of the United States Army. It occurred June 25‚ÄìJune 26, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in eastern Montana Territory near present-day Hardin, Montana, on land that today is part of the Crow Indian Reservation.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904, pp. 1008-1011. The Crow tribe sided with the U.S. army.Hoxie, Frederick E.: Parading Through History. The Making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935. Cambridge, 1995, p. 108. George Armstrong Custer, with 257 men attacked a much larger force of Native Americans, who were defending their civilian encampments, and in three hours the Custer battalion was completely annihilated. Only two men from the 7th Cavalry later claimed to have seen the battle: a young Crow whose name translated as Curley, and a trooper named Peter Thompson, who had fallen behind Custer's column, and most accounts of the last moments of Custer's forces are conjecture. Lakota accounts assert that Crazy Horse personally led one of the large groups of Lakota who overwhelmed the cavalry. While exact numbers are difficult to determine, it is commonly estimated that the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota outnumbered the 7th Cavalry by approximately 3:1, a ratio that was extended to 5:1 during the fragmented parts of the battle. Later, the Sioux were defeated in a series of subsequent battles by the reinforced U.S. Army who continued attacking even in the winter, and most were forced to move onto reservations, mostly outside of Montana, primarily by tactics such as preventing buffalo hunts and enforcing government food-distribution policies to \\"friendlies\\" only. The Lakota were compelled to sign a treaty in 1877 ceding the Black Hills to the United States, but a low-intensity war continued, culminating, fourteen years later, in the killing of Sitting Bull (December 15, 1890) at Standing Rock and the Wounded Knee Massacre (December 29, 1890) at Pine Ridge. =Northern Cheyenne exodus= Stump Horn and family (Northern Cheyenne); showing home and horse-drawn travois. Following the Battle of the Little Bighorn, attempts by the U.S. Army to capture the Cheyenne intensified. A group of 972 Cheyenne was escorted to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in 1877. The government intended to re-unite the Northern and Southern Cheyenne into one nation. There the conditions were dire; the Northern Cheyenne were not used to the climate and soon many became ill with malaria. In addition, the food rations were insufficient and of poor quality. In 1878, the two principal Chiefs, Little Wolf and Morning Star (Dull Knife) pressed for the release of the Cheyenne so they could travel back north. However, they were denied permission, so that same year the two men led a group of 353 Northern Cheyenne who left Indian Territory to travel back north. The Army and other civilian volunteers were in hot pursuit of the Cheyenne as they traveled north. It is estimated that a total of 13,000 Army soldiers and volunteers were sent to pursue the Cheyenne over the whole course of their journey north. After crossing into Nebraska, the group split into two. One group was led by Little Wolf, and the other by Dull Knife. Little Wolf and his band made it back to Montana. Dull Knife and his band were captured and escorted to Fort Robinson, Nebraska and sequestered. They were ordered to return to Oklahoma but they refused. Conditions at the fort grew tense through the end of 1878 and soon the Cheyenne were confined to barracks with no food, water, or heat. In January 1879, Dull Knife and his group broke out of Ft. Robinson. Much of the group was gunned down as they ran away from the fort, and others were discovered near the fort during the following days and ordered to surrender but most of the escapees chose to fight because they would rather be killed than taken back into custody. It is estimated that only 50 survived the breakout, including Dull Knife. Several of the escapees later had to stand trial for the murders that had been committed in Kansas. The remains of those killed were repatriated in 1994. Ultimately, the military gave up attempting to relocate the Northern Cheyenne in Oklahoma. The persistence of the Northern Cheyenne resulted in the creation of the Northern Cheyenne reservation in Montana.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904, pp. 594‚Äì596. =The flight of the Nez Perce= Chief Joseph The Nez Perce people were settled what today is Washington and Oregon, though made hunting forays into western Montana. However, in 1877 pressure from white settlers led to several incidents of violence and a significant number of the Nez Perce were forced from their home region and fled rather than submit to being moved to a reservation. With 2000 U.S. soldiers in pursuit, 800 Nez Perce spent over three months outmaneuvering and battling their pursuers, led by General Howard. They traveled across Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Yellowstone National Park, and Montana. In the process, they held off the Army at the Battle of the Big Hole in southwestern Montana, dropped into Yellowstone Park, then traveled into east-central Montana where they attempted to ally with both the Crow and the Arapaho, but were rebuffed due to tensions surrounding the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. They then turned north, attempting to reach Canada. General Howard, leading the United States cavalry, was impressed with the skill with which the Nez Perce fought, using advance and rear guards, skirmish lines, and field fortifications. However, unbeknownst to the Nez Perce, a force led by Nelson A. Miles was dispatched from eastern Montana on a quick march to intercept them, which occurred less than south of Canada in the Bear Paw Mountains, not far from present-day Chinook in Blaine County. Finally, after a devastating five-day battle during freezing weather conditions with no food or blankets, having lost the major war leaders, Chief Joseph formally surrendered to General Miles on October 5, 1877. =Louis Riel and the Metis= Some M√©tis from the British territory to the north settled in Montana in the latter half of the 19th century. For a time, Louis Riel, the M√©tis leader from Manitoba in exile, taught school at St. Peter's Mission in Montana and was active in the local Republican Party. Democrats alleged he helped M√©tis men, who were not American citizens, to vote for the Republicans. In the summer of 1884, a delegation of M√©tis leaders including Gabriel Dumont and James Isbister, convinced Riel to return north, where in the following year he led the M√©tis revolt against Canadian rule, known as the Northwest Rebellion. Following the defeat of the M√©tis rebels and the imprisonment and later hanging to Riel, Gabriel Dumont fled to exile in Montana. Railroads The railroads were the engine of settlement in the state. Major development occurred in the 1880s. The Northern Pacific Railroad was given land grants by the federal government so that it could borrow money to build its system, reaching Billings in 1882. The federal government kept every other section of land, and gave it away to homesteaders. At first the railroad sold much of its holdings at low prices to land speculators in order to realize quick cash profits, and also to eliminate sizable annual tax bills. The speculators in turn parceled out the land on credit to farmers and ranchers eager to develop operations near a railroad. By 1905 the company changed its land policies as it realize it had been a costly mistake to have sold so much land at wholesale prices. With better railroad service and improved methods of farming the Northern Pacific easily sold what had been heretofore \\"worthless\\" land directly to farmers at good prices. By 1910 the railroad's holdings in North Dakota had been greatly reduced.Ross R. Controneo, \\"Northern Pacific Officials and the Disposition of the Railroad's Land Grant in North Dakota after 1888\\", North Dakota History, 1970, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp.77‚Äì103 Meanwhile, the Great Northern Railroad energetically promoted settlement along its lines in the northern part of the state. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government‚Äîit received no land grants‚Äîand resold them to farmers one by one. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost.David H. Hickcox, \\"The Impact of the Great Northern Railway on Settlement in Northern Montana, 1880‚Äì1920\\", Railroad History, Summer 1983, Issue 148, pp.58‚Äì67Robert F.

In 1907-09 Taft served as a boisterous construction town for the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad. The camp included many ethnic groups, numerous saloons and prostitutes, and substantial violence. When construction was finished, the camp was abandoned.Virginia Weisel Johnson, \\"Tough Taft: Boom Town\\". Montana Dec 1982, Vol. 32 Issue 4, pp.50‚Äì57 In 1882 the Northern Pacific platted Livingston, Montana, a major division point, repair and maintenance center, and gateway to Yellowstone National Park. Built in symmetrical fashion along both sides of the track, the city grew to 7,000 by 1914. Several structures built between 1883 and 1914 still exist and provide a physical record of the era and indicate the city's role as a rail and tourist center. The Northern Pacific depot reflects the desire to impress the tourists who disembarked here for Yellowstone Park, and the railroad's machine shops reveal the city's industrial history.\\"Livingston: Railroad Town on the Yellowstone\\", Montana Dec 1985, Vol. 35 Issue 4, pp.84‚Äì86 Women In Montana, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details.Laurie K. Mercier, \\"Women's Role in Montana Agriculture: 'You Had To Make Every Minute Count,'\\" Montana Dec 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp.50‚Äì61 Jeannette Rankin, August 1916 Efforts to write woman suffrage into Montana's 1889 constitution failed. Montana women, especially \\"society women\\", did not strongly support the suffragists. However, help from national leaders and the efforts of Montana supporters of suffrage such as Jeannette Rankin (1880‚Äì1973), led to success in 1914 when voters ratified a suffrage amendment passed by the legislature in 1913. In 1916, Rankin, a Republican, became the first woman ever elected to Congress. She was elected again in 1940. Rankin was a peace activist, who voted against American entry into both World War I and World War II.James J. Lopach, and Jean A. Luckowski. Jeannette Rankin: a political woman (2005) The status of women in the 19th-century West has drawn the attention of numerous scholars, whose interpretations fall into three types: 1) the Frontier school influenced by Frederick Jackson Turner, which argues that the West was a liberating experience for women and men; 2) the reactionists, who view the West as a place of drudgery for women, who reacted unfavorably to the isolation and difficult work environment in the West; and 3) those writers who claim the West had no distinctive effect on women's lives, that it was a static, neutral frontier. Cole (1990) uses legal records to argue that the Turner thesis best explains the improvement in women's status in Montana and the early achievement of suffrage.Judith K. Cole, \\"A Wide Field for Usefulness: Women'S Civil Status and the Evolution of Women's Suffrage on The Montana Frontier, 1864‚Äì1914\\", American Journal of Legal History, July 1990, Vol. 34 Issue 3, pp.262‚Äì294 Women's clubs expressed the interests, needs, and beliefs of middle-class women around the start of the 20th century. While accepting the domestic role established by the cult of domesticity, their reformist activities reveal a persistent demand for self- expression outside the home. Homesteading was a significant experience for altering women's perceptions of their roles. They expressed their aesthetic interests in gardens and organized social activities. Though these clubs allowed women to fulfill their traditional roles they also encouraged women to pursue social, intellectual, and community interests. Women took an active role in the Progressive Movement, especially in battles for suffrage, prohibition, and better schools. Women were also prominent in church activities, charity work, and crime reduction.Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs, \\"Montana Women's Clubs at the Turn of the Century\\", Montana March 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp.26‚Äì35 Childbirth was serious and sometimes life-threatening for rural women well into the 20th century. Although large families were favored by farm families, most women employed birth control methods to space their children and limit their family size. Pregnant women had little access to modern knowledge about prenatal care. Delivery was the big gamble; the great majority gave birth at home, with the services of a midwife or an experienced neighbor. Despite the increased availability of hospital care after the 1920s, modern medical benefits to mitigate the danger of childbirth were not available to most rural Montana women until the World War II era.Mary Melcher, \\"'Women's Matters': Birth Control, Prenatal Care, and Childbirth in Rural Montana, 1910‚Äì1940\\", Montana June 1991, Vol. 41 Issue 2, pp.47‚Äì56 Agricultural history =Cattle ranching= Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Deer Lodge, MT, date unknown Cattle ranching has long been central to Montana's history and economy. Cattle ranching came early to Montana with the entrepreneurship of Johnny Grant in the Deer Lodge Valley in the late 1850s, who traded fat cattle to settlers in exchange for two trail- worn (but otherwise healthy) animals. He later sold his ranch to Conrad Kohrs, who developed a major cattle empire in the area. Today, Grant's core homestead is the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site on the edge of Deer Lodge, and is maintained as a living demonstration of the ranching style of the late 19th century. It is operated by the National Park Service. In 1866 Nelson Story brought the first herd of Texas longhorns up from Texas. Additional herds came into Montana east of the divide and initially expanded greatly on the open range. Montana stockmen and farmers survived the slump in mining during the early 1870s and were ready by mid-decade to expand eastward onto the plains, as a recovery in mining led to improved markets. However, cattle ranching expanded beyond the carrying capacity of the land, and a drought year combined with the harsh winter of 1886-1887 decimated Montana's cattle industry. The ranchers who survived began to fence in their ranches and the era of the open range came to an end.Michael P. Malone, Richard B. Roeder, \\"1876 in Field and Pasture: Agriculture\\", Montana June 1975, 25(2) pp.28‚Äì35 The memories of cattle ranching form an important part of Montana's modern identity.Jeffrey J. Safford, \\"The Montana Livestock Industry through Oral History\\", Agricultural History, 49(1) (1975), pp. 105-107 in JSTOR =Farming= By 1908, the open range that had sustained Native American tribes and government-subsidized cattle barons was pockmarked with small ranchers and struggling farmers.Warren M. Elofson, Frontier Cattle Ranching in the Land and Times of Charlie Russell (2005) The revised Homestead Act of the early 1900s greatly affected the settlement of Montana. This act expanded the land that was provided by the Homestead Act of 1862 from 160acres to 320 (). When the latter act was signed by President William Taft, it also reduced the time necessary to prove up from five years to three years and permitted five months absence from the claim each year. In 1908, the Sun River Irrigation Project, west of Great Falls was opened up for homesteading. Similar irrigation projects developed in many other Montana communities. Under this Reclamation Act, a person could obtain . Most of the people who came to file on these homesteads were young couples who were eager to live near the mountains where hunting and fishing were good. Many of these homesteaders came from the Midwest and Minnesota. Farming was further encouraged by the railroads. Wheat farming started slowly in Montana, only replacing oats as the major grain crop after development of new plant strains, techniques, and machinery. Wheat was stimulated by boom prices in World War I, but slumped in value and yield during the drought and depression of the next 20 years. Beginning in 1905, the Great Northern Railway in cooperation with the US Department of Agriculture, the Montana Experiment Station, and the Dryland Farming Congress promoted dryland farming in Montana in order to increase its freight traffic. During 1910‚Äì13, the Great Northern launched its own program of demonstration farms, which stimulated settlement (during 1909‚Äì10 acreage in homesteads quadrupled in Montana) through their impressive production rates for winter wheat, barley, oats and other grains.Claire Strom, \\"The Great Northern Railway and Dryland Farming in Montana\\", Railroad History, Summer 1997, Issue 176, pp.80‚Äì102 As a result of the promotion the land along the Milk River, the northern tier, better known as the \\"hi‚Äëline\\", was settled in 1900‚Äì15. In an area better suited to grazing cattle, inexperienced newcomers locally called \\"Honyockers\\" undertook to grow wheat, and met some early success when ample rainfall and high prices were the rule. For several years after 1918, droughts and hot winds destroyed the crops, bringing severe hardships and driving out all but the most determined of the settlers. Much of the land was acquired by stockmen, who have turned it back to grazing cattle.Mabel Lux, \\"Honyockers of Harlem\\", Montana Dec 1963, Vol. 13 Issue 4, pp.2‚Äì14 Business history =Entrepreneurs= Henry Sieben (1847‚Äì1937) came to Montana's gold fields in 1864, was a farm laborer, prospector, and freighter, then turned to livestock raising along the Smith River in 1870. In partnership with his brothers he raised cattle and became one of the territory's pioneer sheep ranchers in 1875. In 1879 Henry moved his stock to the Lewistown area. He established a reputation as an excellent businessman and as someone who took care of his stock and employees. After ranching in the Culbertson area, Sieben purchased ranches near Cascade and along Little Prickly Pear Creek, forming the Sieben Livestock Company. By 1907, these two ranches had become the heart of his cattle and sheep raising business which he directed from his home in Helena. Sieben became well known for his business approach to ranching and for his public and private philanthropies. His family continues to operate the Sieben Ranch Company today,Dick Pace, \\"Henry Sieben: Pioneer Montana Stockman\\", Montana March 1979, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp.2‚Äì15 and one of his descendants is United States Senator Max Sieben Baucus. After seeing the falls of the Missouri River in central Montana, Paris Gibson (1830‚Äì1920) decided the location presented an ideal site for a town. Founding Great Falls, Montana, in 1884, Gibson was inspired by a grandiose vision of an economically prosperous city that was also beautiful. He took an active role in the development of Great Falls, as well as Montana as a whole, making his voice heard on issues from dryland farming to the humane treatment of animals. While many of his visionary ideals have long since been passed by, his efforts at community building in the West serve as a unique example and provide an important perspective on the region's continuing development.Richard B. Roeder, \\"A Settlement on the Plains: Paris Gibson and the Building of Great Falls\\", Montana Dec 1992, Vol. 42 Issue 4, pp.4‚Äì19 The Conrad families built a substantial banking business in north-central and northwestern Montana during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Banking houses at Fort Benton, Great Falls, and Kalispell, owned and managed by the families of William Conrad and Charles Conrad helped to finance Montana's economic development through an intricate pattern of familial, friendship, and business ties. Correspondent linkages to large metropolitan banks sustained the relatively small country banks by assuring them access to capital. The Conrad banks were aggressive in penetrating new lending markets and making inroads into the local farming, ranching, merchant, and manufacturing sectors. The banks grew in reputation and stature as the region developed, but remained single-unit, family-based enterprises. But Conrad's expanded across the international border into Alberta through the Conrad Circle Cattle Company.Henry C. Klassen, \\"The Early Growth of the Conrad Banking Enterprise in Montana, 1880‚Äì1914\\", Great Plains Quarterly, Jan 1997, Vol. 17 Issue 1, pp.49‚Äì62 Banking in Montana was a high risk business, as the 1920s demonstrated. Between 1921 and 1925 half of the state's 428 banks closed. There was an excessive number of small, weak banks in the grain-growing areas of Eastern Montana where the postwar slump wiped out land values and related loans.Clarence W. Groth, \\"Sowing and Reaping: Montana Banking, 1910‚Äì1925\\", Montana Dec 1970, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp.28‚Äì35 Montana's history was heavily dominated by its \\"Copper Kings\\". Marcus Daly (1841‚Äì1900), an Irish immigrant, left a legacy of physical structures throughout Montana. Starting with his development of the Alice mine in Butte, he then founded the community of Anaconda where he built a smelter. Butte, with its mixture of poor miners' shacks, richly ornamented homes, mines, and mills, symbolized industrial mining. At Anaconda, the company town, the great Washoe Stack smelted the ore from Butte, bringing immense wealth to the region but also spewed pollutants that left the landscape downwind of the smelter wasted and barren. Daly's lumber mill at Bonner dominated the town. In the agricultural community of Hamilton, Daly built the Bitterroot Stock Farm with its, complete with racetrack and mansion.Carroll Van West, \\"Marcus Daly and Montana: One Man's Imprint on the Land\\", Montana Mar 1987, Vol. 37 Issue 1, pp.60‚Äì62 His archrival, W.A. Clark, invested heavily in the Butte mines and parlayed his influence into the political arena, engineering the selection of Helena over Anaconda as the state capitol. He later was elected as Montana's U.S. Senator under circumstances of such corruption that his antics provided one of the incentives for the Constitutional amendment allowing direct election of senators. Simon Pepin (1840‚Äì1914), was born in Quebec in 1840, emigrated to Montana in 1863, and became a contractor furnishing supplies for the construction of forts Custer, Assiniboine, and Maginnis. Pepin purchased ranch lands near Fort Assiniboine. When James J. Hill built the Great Northern Railway across northern Montana, Pepin convinced him to build his locomotive shops at Havre, on property owned by Pepin. In the ensuing years, Pepin was a major contributor to Havre's economic growth through his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises.Dave Walter, \\"Simon Pepin, A Quiet Capitalist\\", Montana March 1989, Vol. 39 Issue 1, pp.34‚Äì38 Main Street in Red Lodge, 2000, showing iron facades on buildings Failures mixed with successes in Montana business history. The closure in 1964 of the Missoula Brewing Company exemplified the difficulties small businesses faced when competing with large producers. Opened in 1900, the brewery closed during Prohibition but resumed production of its Highlander brand in 1933. Government regulation and taxation, isolation, out-of-state competition, and limited promotion reduced the Highlander share of the market following World War II. The brewery closed in 1964 to make way for an interstate highway, ending the era of Montana- brewed beer. Rainier bought the Highlander name, but the former failure in quality control had hurt the Highlander reputation.John Andrew Kutzman, \\"Death of a Small Business: The Missoula Brewing Company\\", Montana March 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 1, pp.54‚Äì61 Many entrepreneurs built stores, shops, and offices along Main Street. The most handsome ones used pre-formed, sheet iron facades, especially those manufactured by the Mesker Brothers of St. Louis. These neoclassical, stylized facades added sophistication to brick or wood-frame buildings throughout the state.Arthur A. Hart, \\"Sheet Iron Elegance: Mail Order Architecture in Montana\\", Montana Dec 1990, Vol. 40 Issue 4, pp.26‚Äì31 =Retail business= In the rural areas farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criteria was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops or cattle were later sold; the business owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success.Lewis E. Atherton, The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America (University of Missouri Press, 1971) In the cities consumers had more choices, usually purchasing dry goods and supplies at locally owned department stores such as Helena's T.C. Power & Bro, which expanded into several cities, I.G. Baker & Co. in Fort Benton, Strain Bros. of Great Falls, F.A. Buttrey & Co. in Havre, and others. They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. Department stores provided limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks‚Äîusually men before the 1940s‚Äîwere experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class women who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Denver, Minneapolis, and Chicago once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward provided serious competition, so the department stores came to rely even more on salesmanship as well as close integration with the community.Henry C. Klassen, \\"T.C. Power & Bro.: The Rise of a Small Western Department Store, 1870‚Äì1902\\", Business History Review, Volume: 66. Issue: 4. 1992. pp.671+ in JSTORWilliam R. Leach, \\"Transformations in a Culture of Consumption: Women and Department Stores, 1890‚Äì1925\\", Journal of American History 71 (Sept. 1984): 319‚Äì342 in JSTOR Natural resource development =Mining and organized labor= Mining headframes in Butte, MT Butte Copper made Butte one of the most prosperous cities in the world, due to deposits dubbed \\"the Richest Hill on Earth\\".Michael P. Malone, William L. Lang, The battle for Butte: mining and politics on the northern frontier, 1864‚Äì1906 (2006) From 1892 through 1903, the Anaconda mine in Butte was the largest copper-producing mine in the world. It produced more than $300 million worth of metal in its lifetime. The nearby city of Anaconda was the dream child of industrialist Marcus Daly (1841‚Äì1900), whose Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM) by 1900 employed three-quarters of Montana's wage earners; it dominated the state's politics and press into the 1950s. The smelters in Anaconda process the copper mined in Butte. From 1884 to 1934, the company fought industrial unionism; finally in 1901 workers there organized a local of the radical Western Federation of Miners (WFM). In 1916, the WFM became the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW), one of the ten original unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s. However, the union remained weak until 1934, when members joined with miners, other smelter workers, and some craft laborers in the region in a strike that forced the company to negotiate. In the late 1940s the CIO purged unions controlled by Communists, which meant the expulsion of the IUMMSW and a bid for influence among smelter workers by the anticommunist United Steel Workers of America (USWA). In 1980, most of the copper mines and smelters were shut down, leaving a major cleanup mess for the Environmental Protection Agency.Laurie Mercier, Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City (University of Illinois Press, 2001) Butte was one of the largest cities west of the Mississippi for generations. Silver Bow county (Butte and suburbs) had 24,000 people in 1890, and peaked at 60,000 in 1920. Then the population steadily declined to 34,000 in 1990 and stabilized. In its heyday between the late 19th century and about 1920, it was the largest and most notorious copper boomtowns in the American West, home to hundreds of saloons and a famous red-light district. The documentary Butte, America depicts its history as a copper producer and the issues of labor unionism, economic rise and decline, and environmental degradation that resulted from the activity. Mining camps Many mining camps were established in the late 19th century, some becoming established cities like Butte and Red Lodge which survived the closure of their mines. Others enjoyed a boom period then withered away, though some, such as Bannack have since become famed as \\"ghost towns\\" and have been preserved. Another example was the community of Comet, in what today is Jefferson County, where there were mines and processing mills from 1869 to 1941. At its height, Comet was a town of 12 blocks and 6 streets and by 1911 had extracted $13 million worth of metals (gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper ore), but is now abandoned and decaying. The town's most prominent remains are the mill, office, and bunkhouse, which are leftovers from the last productive years in the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the other structures and buildings have collapsed from neglect.Christine W. Brown, \\"Comet, Montana: The Architecture of Abandonment\\", Montana Dec 2005, Vol. 55 Issue 4, pp.60‚Äì62 Anaconda Metals manufacturing dominated life in four Montana communities: Anaconda,Mercier, Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City (2001) Black Eagle (a suburb of Great Falls), East Helena, and Columbia Falls. The industrial workers who lived in the shadow of the smokestacks faced health hazards and job insecurity. Wives often worked to supplement the family income and after 1960 women increasingly worked outside the home. The smelters, usually the only workplace for young men who wished to remain in the community, created blue-collar towns. Residents expressed a love-hate relationship with the companies, which paid high wages for semi- skilled workers and supported community projects but were heavy-handed with the workers. Labor unions united the community workers and local business.Laurie K. Mercier, \\"'The Stack Dominated Our Lives': Metals Manufacturing In Four Montana Communities\\", Montana June 1988, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp.40‚Äì57 In 1903, the Socialist Party of America won its first victory west of the Mississippi when Anaconda, Montana, elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen. The Socialist Party had grown within the Montana labor movement. Initially, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company tolerated them, but when the Socialists gained political power and threatened to implement reform, particularly when a socialist mayor was also elected in Butte, the company systematically undermine the Socialists. City workers and councilmen refused to cooperate with the new mayor, and the company began to fire Socialists. In the long run labor lost ground in Anaconda and the company exerted ever greater political control.Jerry Calvert, \\"The Rise and Fall of Socialism in a Company Town, 1902‚Äì1905\\", Montana Dec 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp.2‚Äì13 =Timber= Timber resources were critical to both mines and railroads. Western Montana had ample timber but not always along the most natural railroad routes, and timber near mines was quickly depleted. Thus huge swaths of timber resources were made available to private railroad and mining interests, usually in a checkerboard pattern of ownership interspersed with sections of publicly held land. The communities of Libby, Kalispell and Missoula rose in part due to the demand for timber and their location along strategic waterways. =Coal= Montana holds significant coal reserves and strip mining became the most economically feasible method by which to extract coal. Major coal deposits were located near the southeastern Montana settlements of Birney and Decker, and mining soon replaced cattle ranching in the immediate area. The small community of Colstrip grew substantially as it became the site for several major coal-fired power plants associated at the time with Western Energy, a subsidiary of the Montana Power Company. For residents of the region, the characteristic sense of community disappeared. The physical damage to the environment was an important factor as was the influx of miners who then outnumbered the original population. Most damaging, however, was the strife between pro- and anti-development factions in the community. Most of the inhabitants of small towns like Decker, convinced their old lifestyle had been destroyed, moved elsewhere. Residents around Birney, farther from the site of strip mining, remained divided on whether the changes had improved their quality of life.Patrick C. Jobes, \\"A Small Rural Community Responds To Coal Development\\", Sociology and Social Research, Jan 1986, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp.174‚Äì177 =Oil= Map of Williston Basin oil fields with reservoirs in Bakken Formation Prospectors discovered numerous small oil fields in the state after 1910. The oil went to small local refineries which marketed the gasoline locally through a network of service stations using the same brand name. After 1945 majors such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon-Mobil) and Union Oil of California grew rapidly and by the 1950s owned 80% of refining capacity. In 1949 the value of Montana oil passed the value of copper mining. After 1945 oil production escalated in Alberta, and pipelines were built to Billings to serve the American market. The short-lived Williston Basin boom in the 1950s did not help Montana refiners because pipelines moved the oil out of state for refining. By 1960 Montana refiners depended on Canadian sources. By 2000 only four refineries remained in the state. Production, which peaked at 48 million barrels in 1968, fell by 1990 to less than 20 million, and highly efficient technology significantly reduced employment.Joseph M. Ashley, \\"Montana's Refining Industry. Part 2: 1942‚Äì1996\\", Montana: The Magazine of Western History, June 1998, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp.16‚Äì33 After the discovery of oil in the Williston Basin, Glendive became an oil boom town. The small reserves of the basin, coupled with the expense and difficulty of moving the oil out of the area, brought the end of the oil boom in Glendive in 1954. In the 1970s, new discoveries, combined with international fluctuations in the oil industry, created a second boom centered around the community of Sidney. This boom also faded. However new drilling techniques involving horizontal drilling and fracturing technology, made it financially attractive to drill very deep new wells in the Bakken Formation of the Williston Basin. The discovery in 2000 of the extremely rich Elm Coulee Oil Field near Sidney in Richland County‚Äîwith a potential for many billions of barrels of oil‚Äîand the high price of oil has created a new regional boom in the 21st century.U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration \\"Technology-Based Oil and Natural Gas Plays: Shale Shock! Could There Be Billions in the Bakken?\\" (2006) =Dams and hydropower= The development of electrical power led to demand for electricity. The combination of Montana's abundant rivers combined with ready availability of natural resources for transporting electricity led to the building of multiple dams across the state, particularly a number on the Missouri River, most owned and operated by the Montana Power Company. The city of Great Falls, due to the presence of several existing natural cascades, became a center for hydropower development. In 1933‚Äì43, the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Public Works Administration built the Fort Peck Dam on the Missouri River; it became the largest earthen dam in the world. The goals were to provide flood control, irrigation water, and (in a later upgrade) hydroelectric power, as well as employment for 10,000 men during the Great Depression. It cost more than $160 million.Bob Saindon, and Bunky Sullivan, \\"Taming the Missouri and Treating the Depression: Fort Peck Dam\\", Montana Sept 1977, 27(3) pp.34‚Äì57 As Chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee in the 1950s, Senator James E. Murray promoted federal development of hydroelectric power through large dams throughout the West. He secured funding for major dams in Montana at Canyon Ferry on the Missouri River, Yellowtail on the Bighorn River, Hungry Horse on the Flathead River, and Libby on the Kootenai River.Donald F. Spritzer, Senator James E. Murray and the Limits of Post-War Liberalism (1985) Politics Montana politics historically were noted for the tendency of Montanans to vote independently, with split ticket voting common and for races to be likely to fall to either major political party, though certain regions of the state more predictably fell into one partisan camp or the other. At times it was said that Montana \\"sent its liberals to Washington and its conservatives to [the state capitol] Helena\\". Considering its relatively brief history, the state produced a number of notable and colorful political figures, including Democrats Thomas Francis Meagher, William Andrews Clark, Thomas J. Walsh, Burton K. Wheeler, James E. Murray, and Mike Mansfield; and Republicans Jeannette Rankin and Joseph M. Dixon. Joseph M. Dixon, Congressman (1903‚Äì1913) and Governor of Montana (1921‚Äì1925) =Joseph Dixon= Joseph M. Dixon (1867‚Äì1934), was a Republican politician from Missoula. He served as a Representative, Senator, and the seventh Governor of Montana. A businessman and a modernizer of Quaker heritage, Dixon was a leader of the Progressive Movement in Montana and nationally in 1912, serving as national campaign manager or Theodore Roosevelt's unsuccessful third term candidacy for president. His term as governor, 1921‚Äì1924, was unsuccessful, as severe economic hardship limited the opportunities to enact his proposed reforms in state government. His great enemy, the Anaconda Copper company, mobilized its resources to defeat his reelection bid in 1924.Jules A. Karlin. \\"Dixon, Joseph Moore\\"; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends (2003), pp.59‚Äì88 =Senator James Murray= James E. Murray (1876‚Äì1961) was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, but in 1897 after the death of his father he went to live with a wealthy uncle in Butte, who owned copper mines. Murray, an Irish Catholic, practiced law in Butte and was active in the Democratic Party, working closely with labor unions to build his liberal political base. In 1921, he inherited millions from his late uncle, dabbled in Irish politics, and reentered Montana politics when the Great Depression soured the Montana economy in the 1930s.John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends (2003), pp.197‚Äì228 When Senator Walsh resigned to enter Roosevelt's Cabinet in 1933, John Erickson the Democratic governor had himself appointed to the slot, despite his weak political base. Murray defeated Erickson in the 1934 primary, and was elected senator on the platform of \\"one hundred per-cent support\\" of President Roosevelt. Murray served in until 1960, becoming a powerful senior senator. Murray was a staunch liberal and aggressive supporter of the New Deal Coalition. Murray broke with the senior senator Burton K. Wheeler, also a Democrat.John Morrison and Catherine Wright Morrison, Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Legends (2003), pp.161‚Äì196 on Wheeler Wheeler led the opposition to Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, while Murray supported FDR. Unlike Wheeler, Murray gave up his isolationism in foreign affairs, and backed Roosevelt's aggressive foreign policy against Germany and Japan in 1939‚Äì1941. In 1938 the state's labor federations (AFL and CIO) and the Farmers Union formed the \\"Montana Council for Progressive Political Action\\" to coordinate support for New Deal liberals like Murray. They opposed the alliance between the Republicans and the conservative Democrats led by Wheeler.Malone, Montana (1991) pp.307‚Äì308 After the war, the conservatives controlled Congress, so Murray had little success with his proposals to expand Social Security, provide free medical care for the aged, expand federal aid to education, or create a Missouri Valley Authority with the federal control over Montana's water resources patterned after the Tennessee Valley Authority. Instead, Congress adopted the Pick-Sloan Plan with flood control by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and private development.Robert T. Bruns. \\"Murray, James Edward\\"; http://www.anb.org/articles/07/07-00214.html American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. The Murray Hotel in Livingston, Montana was financed by the Murray family and named for the senator. Montana since 1945 =Regional changes= Since the 1970s, the western third of the state has grown and attracted tourists, retirees, and up-scale part-time residents seeking spectacular mountain scenery as well as an interest in outdoor recreational activities, including hiking, hunting and fishing.Pat Williams and Salvatore Vasapolli, Montana (2003) p. 16 Housing prices soared, but then declined sharply in the Great recession of 2008.Paul E. Polzen, \\"Flathead County: Midyear 2011\\" (U. Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research, 2011) p 6 Simultaneously the shift to a postmodern service economy has led to growth in service-oriented cities such as Billings (with medicine and the energy industry) in the eastern part of the state, and in the western half, Missoula (with higher education). Cities such as Bozeman and Kalispell saw significant growth related to tourism. Meanwhile, the populations of older mining centers such as Butte and Anaconda shrunk. After ARCO shut down the Anaconda copper operations in 1980, its former mines and smelter became the Environmental Protection Agency's second largest Superfund cleanup site.Laurie Mercier, Anaconda: labor, community, and culture in Montana's smelter city (2001) pp.206,263 In the late twentieth century and early twenty first century many of the small towns in eastern Montana had steadily been losing population.Marvin E. Gloege, Survival or gradual extinction: the small town in the Great Plains of eastern Montana (Meadowlark Publishing Services, 2007) However, due to the Bakken oil region, towns such as Sidney are now experiencing a boom in population. As of 2012 Richland County, of which Sidney is the county seat, is the fourth fastest growing county in the nation.https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb13-46.htmlJay Kohn, \\"Bakken oil boom knockin' on Montana's door \\", May 12, 2011 KTVQ Billings has been growing and serves as a transportation, refining, financial and technical center for the booming oil and coal industries, as well as ranching and farming.Jay Kohn, \\"Business leaders learn about Bakken opportunities \\", Oct 20, 2011 KTVQ =Party politics= For historian Michael Malone, \\"One of the most refreshing aspects of Montana politics is its open, breezy, grass-roots democratic atmosphere. The state's small and unpretentious population has ready access to political leaders and political power\\".Malone, Montana: a history of two centuries (1991) p. 381 Though historically a swing state politically, beginning with the 1988 election, the state tended toward Republican party domination until 2004, when the election of a Democratic governor and a return of the legislature to divided party rule temporarily moved the state back into the swing status, solidified by the election of Senator Jon Tester in 2006. In the 2008 and 2010 elections, a Republican majority again gained full control of the legislature, but all five statewide offices remained in Democratic hands. When the 2012 election moved Steve Bullock, a Democrat who had been Attorney general to the office of governor, the Attorney General's office moved to Republican hands for the first time since 1992. In 2014 Governor Bullock later appointed Lieutenant Governor John Walsh to become the new senator to replace Max Baucus, the incoming Ambassador to China. Baucus had served 1979‚Äì2014, and played a major role in writing the nation's health care and tax laws. The 2014 Senate election became a contest between Walsh and Republican Congressman Steve Daines. Current controversial political topics include a recent Montana Supreme Court decision handed down in late December 2011, Western Tradition Partnership v. Montana,Johnson, Charles S. \\"Montana Supreme Court Upholds Political Spending Ban\\" Helena Independent Record December 31, 2011 The decision upholds Montana's 1912 Corrupt Practices Act, which banned direct corporate spending in state elections. It is anticipated to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, as it directly challenges certain provisions of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission as applied to state elections. MONTANA! Daily Kos December 31, 2011 Other major current issues include natural resource extraction activities such as the routing of the Keystone Pipeline through Montana, the use of fracking technology for fossil fuel extraction, and the development of Montana's coal resources, particularly in the Otter Creek area. =Environmentalism= Various forms of conservation and environmental concern date to the earliest years of the territory. In 1872, Yellowstone National Park, situated partially in Montana, was created. In the 1890s the efforts of George Bird Grinnell (a naturalist) and Louis W. Hill (the president of the Great Northern Railway) and others led to the creation of Glacier National Park, which was set apart by Congress in 1910.Andrew C. Harper, \\"The Creation of Montana's Glacier National Park\\", Montana: The Magazine of Western History, Summer 2010, 60(2) pp.3‚Äì24 Hill was especially interested in sponsoring artists to come to the park, and he built tourist lodges that displayed their work. His hotels in the park never made a profit but they attracted thousands of visitors who came via the Great Northern.Hip√≥lito Rafael Chac√≥n, \\"The Art of Glacier National Park\\", Montana: The Magazine of Western History, Summer 2010, Vol. 60 Issue 2, pp.56‚Äì74 The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a New Deal agency for young men, played a major role 1933‚Äì42 in developing both Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park. CCC projects included reforestation, campground development, trail construction, fire hazard reduction, and fire-fighting work.Matthew A. Redinger, \\"The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Development of Glacier and Yellowstone Parks, 1933‚Äì1942\\", Pacific Northwest Forum, 1991, Vol. 4 Issue 2, pp.3‚Äì17 The new 1972 state constitution placed Montana in \\"the forefront of states concerned with preservation and environmental protection\\". The preamble, for example, expressed an official view of the importance of natural resources to the future of the Montana.James J. Lopach, We the people of Montana--: the workings of a popular government (1983) p 259 A guarantee of a clean and healthful environment was declared an inalienable right in the Declaration of Rights, and elaborated upon further in Article IX, concerning Environmental protection and improvement. There continues to be a clash between the forces favoring business development of natural resources (especially coal, oil, gas, electricity, timber and pipeline companies), and environmentalists who put a higher priority on preservation and protection of scenery and wildlife.Lopach, We the people of Montana--: the workings of a popular government (1983) 291 For example, after the age of coal mining arrived in eastern Montana in the late 1960s, the issue became use of Yellowstone River Basin's water to cool the coal-burning electricity plants planned for Colstrip. Environmentalists rallied cattle ranchers, fishing organizations and other recreational river users to oppose strip mining. These groups succeeded after intense debates in forming of organizations such as the Northern Plains Resource Council, and securing legislative enactment of Montana's Environmental Protection Act (MEPA) and the Major Facilities Siting Act.Donald MacMillan, Smoke Wars: Anaconda Copper, Montana Air Pollution, and the Courts, 1890‚Äì1924 (Montana Historical Society Press; 2000) pp.4‚Äì5 Howard Newspaperman and lecturer Joseph Kinsey Howard (1906‚Äì51) believed Montana and the rural West provided the \\"last stand against urban technological tedium\\" for the individual. His Montana: High, Wide and Handsome (1943) gave impetus to the environmental movement. Howard fervently believed that small towns of the sort that predominated in Montana provided a democratic bulwark for society. Howard's writings demonstrate his strong belief in the necessity to identify and preserve a region's cultural heritage. His book as numerous speeches and magazine articles, were based on his ideals of community awareness and identity, his hatred of the Anaconda Company, and called on readers to retain an idealistic vision contesting the deadening demands of the modern corporate world.Richard B. Roeder, \\"Joseph Kinsey Howard and his Vision of the West\\", Montana March 1980, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp.2‚Äì11 The book's 27 chapters were grouped into sections on Prairie, Prophet, Prospector, Puncher, Plow, Panic, and Planning. Each chapter was written with emotionally charged prose that marked a dramatic change from the standard histories romanticizing the Old West. Howard focused on economics, arguing that Native Americans had \\"the perfect balance of Nature, man, and food in this grim and unforgiving land\\". Howard presented themes that reverberated in environmentalist thinking for over a half century, alleging that the white invaders destroyed \\"the natural economy of the northern Great Plains\\" and in return built little that lasted. Moreover, the new industrial economy, despite all its promises, could never restore the old balance of man and nature.Howard quoted in Molly Rozum, \\"Montana: High, Wide and Handsome\\", American Review of Canadian Studies, Aug. 2004, 34(3) pp.541‚Äì554 Scholars have judged the book \\"heavily romantic and melodramatic\\" and have called many of his conclusions \\"simplistic\\", but they also argue Montana: High, Wide and Handsome \\"has probably affected people's thinking about Montana more than any other work\\".Michael P. Malone, Richard B. Roeder, and William L. Lang, Montana: A History of Two Centuries (2003 ed.) pp.374‚Äì375 =Higher education= In 1994, in the face of declining state spending, the Montana Board of Regents of Higher Education restructured the state's public colleges and universities. It put Montana's 14 campuses in five categories: two state university systems (University of Montana and Montana State University), a community college system emphasizing technology, tribal colleges, and independent colleges not controlled by the state. =Medical marijuana debate= Medicinal marijuana has been a major political issue in recent years, according to the state's news editors at major newspapers. In 2004, Montana voters approved an initiative to legalize use of medicinal marijuana to registered users who had a doctor's prescription. By 2010, many businesses had sprung up, and certain physicians diagnosed, at times, hundreds of people a day.Matt Gouras, \\"Associated Press: Medical marijuana Montana's top story of 2010\\", Missoulian, 25 December 2010 The number of registered users jumped from 2000 in 2009 to more than 30,000 by June 2011. The 2011 Montana Legislature attempted to repeal legalization, but their bill was vetoed by Gov. Brian Schweitzer. A compromise was reached; he signed a law prohibiting providers to charge patients for medical marijuana, limited each provider to three patients, and made it more difficult for patients to get a physician's approval to use medical marijuana. In addition, federal drug officials made multiple raids in the state. Outlets dropped from 4,848 in March 2011 to 383 by November 2011.Matt Volz, \\"Marijuana Montana's top story of 2011\\", Great Falls Tribune, Dec. 24, 2011 Court action ensued, and in the summer of 2011, a state District Court judge blocked parts of the law from taking effect. Advocates for medical marijuana sought to put a new referendum on the statewide ballot for 2012. The court case is on appeal to the Montana Supreme Court.Mike Dennison, \\"Medical marijuana: State appeals ruling that blocked restrictions in Montana law\\", Missoulian 9 August 2011 Bibliography =Surveys=  Hamilton, James McClellan.

Overview Assets under management (AUM) is very popular within the financial industry as a measure of size and success of an investment management firm, compared with its history of assets under management in previous periods, and compared with the firm's competitors.Assets Under Management - AUM Methods of calculating AUM vary between firms. Investment management companies generally charge their clients fees as a proportion of assets under management, so assets under management, combined with the firm's average fee rate, are the key factors indicating an investment management company's top line revenue. The fee structure depends on the contract between each client and the firm or fund. Assets under management rise and fall. They may increase when investment performance is positive, or when new customers and new assets are brought into the firm. Rising AUM normally increases the fees which the firm generates. Conversely, AUM are reduced by negative investment performance, as well as redemptions or withdrawals, including fund closures, client defections and other generally adverse events. Lower AUM tend to result in lower fees generated. Content Assets under management includes: * Capital raised from investors; * Capital belonging to the principals of the fund management firm. For example, if fund managers contribute $2B of their own capital to the fund and raise additional $10B from investors, their AUM is $12B.

Life Townshend was the son of John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend, and Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart. The soldier George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, was one of his paternal great-grandfathers, and Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was one of his maternal great-grandfathers. He was elected to the House of Commons for Tamworth in 1855 (succeeding his father), a seat he held until 1863, when he inherited the marquessate on his father's death and entered the House of Lords. At the Salisbury Petty Sessions in May 1881, Lord Edward Thynne described how he had been accosted by Lord Townshend and two accomplices on the road between Laverstock and Salisbury. A Colonel Nepean held the pony's head while Townshend struck him several times with the handle of a horse whip. Thynne acknowledged having eloped with Lady Townshend in 1872, but noted that the marquess had never sued for divorce, and alleged that Lord Macduff had attacked him over the same matter while he was abroad. Townshend was convicted of the assault, and sentenced to a fine of ¬£500 or three months in prison. After some hours in jail, he reluctantly paid the fine, equivalent to ¬£ in . Townshend denounced the court, while Vanity Fair reported unnamed others as saying \\"the only regret is that he [Thynne] was not thrashed earlier and worse\\".

Elizabeth Noel. He was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Dursley prior to succeeding as Earl of Berkeley in 1710. He was a distinguished Royal Navy officer who served as First Lord of the Admiralty during the reign of King George I. Viscount Dursley received his commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy on 10 March 1699James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and was promoted to captain on 2 April 1701. He was also a Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester 1701-1702. He took part in the battle off M√°laga under Admiral Rooke, commanding HMS Boyne. He was summoned to Parliament by writ of acceleration as Baron Berkeley on 5 March 1705, and continued to rise in the Navy. Dursley commanded HMS St George in 1706, and narrowly escaped the Scilly naval disaster in which Sir Cloudesley Shovell in HMS Association was lost on 23 October 1707.

The 6mm U.S.N. or Lee Navy Cartridge was also used in the navy version of the Colt‚ÄìBrowning Model 1895 machinegun.The New York World, The World Almanac and Encyclopedia: Rifles Used by the Principal Powers of the World, Vol. 1 No. 4, New York: Press Publishing Co. (January 1894), p. 309: The Naval Small Arms Board reported that in adopting the 6mm cartridge specification, \\"due consideration has been given to the desirability of using the same cartridge for machine guns as for the small arm, and the Board deems that no difficulty in the manufacture or manipulation of machine guns will be caused by their use of 6mm ammunition.\\" Production history and development By 1894, the U.S. Navy desired to adopt a modern small-bore, smokeless powder rifle in keeping with other first-line naval powers. Naval authorities decided that the new cartridge should be adaptable to both rifles and machine guns. As the military forces began adopting smaller and smaller caliber rifles with higher velocity cartridges, U.S. naval authorities decided to leapfrog developments by adopting a semi-rimless cartridge in 6-mm caliber, with a case capable of holding a heavy charge of smokeless powder.Sampson, W.T., The Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of Chief of Bureau of Ordnance, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1895), pp. 215‚Äì218 On August 1, 1894 a naval test board was convened at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island to test submitted magazine rifles in the new 6mm Navy government chambering.Sampson, W.T., Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of Chief of Bureau of Ordnance, Notice to Inventors and Others, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1894), pp. 385‚Äì388 Per the terms of the Notice to Inventors, the new government-designed 6mm U.S.N a.k.a. Ball Cartridge, 6mm was the only cartridge permitted for rifles tested before the Naval Small Arms Board. Both the ammunition and rifle barrels were supplied by the government; the barrels, made of 4.5 per cent nickel steel, used Metford-pattern rifling with a rifling twist of one turn in 6.5 inches, and were supplied unchambered with the receiver thread uncut. The rifle action was required to withstand the firing of five overpressure (proof) cartridges with a chamber pressure of 60,000 psi. In the first set of service trials, the naval small arms board tested several submissions, including the Van Patten, Daudeteau, Briggs-Kneeland, Miles, the Russell-Livermore Magazine Rifle, five Remington turnbolt designs (all with side-mounted magazines), and the Lee straight-pull.The Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of the Secretary of the Navy ‚Äì Report of Naval Small Arms Board, October 22, 1894, November 22, 1894, and May 15, 1895, Washington, D.C.: United States Navy Dept.

The Durst prototype fractured the receiver in firing and was withdrawn from the test, while the Luger Rifle performed excellently. Luger's submission had only one major disadvantage: it failed to meet government specifications, having been chambered in a non-standard rimless 6mm cartridge. The Lee turning bolt design was considered to be a good one, but marred by its magazine system, which the Small Arms Board found to be problematic. The Board thought so highly of the Luger Rifle that it recommended purchase of either a prototype or an option to purchase the rights to manufacture. Apparently this never came to pass, as Luger not only declined to submit its design in the Navy's government 6mm chambering, but withdrew from the third round of the service trials. The Lee straight-pull rifle with its clip-loaded magazine was chosen as the winner in repeated small arms trials, and was selected for adoption by the U.S. Navy in 1895 as the Lee Rifle, Model of 1895, caliber 6-mm, a.k.a. the M1895 Lee Navy. =First contract= The first naval contract for the M1895 was let to Winchester for 10,000 rifles in January 1896 (serials 1‚Äì9999).Henshaw, Thomas, The History of Winchester Firearms 1866‚Äì1992 (6th ed.), Academic Learning Company LLC, , (1993), pp. 47‚Äì48 However, deliveries of the initial shipment of 10,000 rifles were not completed until 1897, owing to delays caused by manufacturing issues, as well as contract changes imposed by the navy.Dept. of the Navy, The Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.: United States Navy Dept. (1897), pp. 321‚Äì323 The latter included a significant change in ammunition specification, which required extensive test firings followed by recalibration of the sights. Of the 10,000 rifles produced under the first contract, 1,800 were issued to the U.S. Marine Corps.Flayderman, Norm, Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values (9th ed.), F + W Media, Inc., , 9780896894556 (2007), pp. 319‚Äì320 Marine battalions scheduled to be equipped with the 6 mm Lee rifle did not begin to receive their new rifles and ammunition until 1897, two years after adoption of the cartridge and rifle.Heywood, Charles (Col. Commandant), Annual Reports of the Navy, Report of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1897) pp. 558‚Äì559 Colonel-Commandant Charles Heywood of the Marine Corps reportedly refused small initial allotments of the 6 mm Lee rifle to the Corps until he was given assurances that the Corps would be immediately issued at least 3,000 Lee rifles, improved target ranges, and most importantly, enough ammunition for Marine units to continue their existing marksmanship program.Hearn, Chester G., Illustrated Directory of the United States Marine Corps, Zenith Imprint Press, , (2003), pp. 74, 78‚Äì79 Despite this threat, the September 1897 report of the Marine Corps Quartermaster to the Secretary of the Navy urgently requested a minimum additional $10,000 in funding to purchase sufficient 6 mm ammunition to allow Marines to conduct live fire and target practice with the Lee rifle.Denny, F.L., The Annual Reports of the Navy Department, Report of the Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps Quartermaster Estimates, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1897), pp. 572‚Äì573 The report warned that, except for drill practice, enlisted Marines were \\"entirely unfamiliar with the use of this arm\\", since all target practice still had to be conducted using the old single-shot Springfield and .45-70 black-powder ammunition. Rifles with a serial number below 13390 (approx.) were made prior to December 31, 1898. Additional smaller purchases were subsequently made to replace lost weapons, mostly in response to a fire at the New York Navy Yard which damaged or destroyed about 2,500 rifles; around 230 rifles were condemned as unrestorable. The additional small quantity purchases by the Navy as well as all sporting models fall into the 10000‚Äì15000 serial range, purchased between the two major contracts. Some confusion arises as to production dates for the sporting rifles as many of the commercially manufactured and numbered receivers (not USN marked) were not made into complete rifles until 1902, and sales continued until 1916. Military rifles have 28-inch (71-cm) barrels and navy anchor stamp, while rifles made for civilian sale have 24-inch (61-cm) barrels and no anchor.Schreier, Philip American Rifleman (May 2008) p.104 =Second contract= A second contract was let on February 7, 1898 for an additional 5,000 rifles at $18.75 each. This second contract (serials 15001 to 20000) began delivery in August 1898 and was completed in December 1898. =Reliability in the field= Overall, the Lee had a reputation for reliability in the field, though some issues were never overcome during the rifle's relatively short service life. Beginning in 1898, during the Marine expeditionary campaign in Cuba, reports emerged from the field criticizing the floating extractor design.Reid, George C. (Maj.), The Annual Reports of the Navy Department, Report of the Secretary of the Navy, Report of Inspection of the Marine Battalion at Camp Heywood, Seaveys Island, Portsmouth, N.H., September 14, 1898: Arms, Vol. 3753, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1898), pp. 847‚Äì849: Some rifles were not yet sighted in for the new 112-grain loading, while others suffered broken extractor springs, triggers, and followers. The breechblock stop could be misplaced while cleaning, resulting in the loss of the extractor and spring. As the extractor was not pinned to the bolt, it could and did occasionally fall out and become lost when the bolt release catch was pressed and the bolt either fell out or was removed for cleaning. The floating extractor was a regular source of trouble throughout the Lee's short service life. The firing pin lock and bolt- lock actuator were relatively fragile, and would occasionally break or malfunction, while the tension in the en bloc cartridge clips proved difficult to regulate, occasionally causing failures to feed.Dept. of the Navy, The Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of Naval Board on Small Arms, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1895), pp. 308‚Äì309 Design and operation =Magazine system= The Lee's magazine system was improved over the prior navy rifle, the M1885 Remington-Lee, by incorporating a clip- loaded magazine system and an action capable of handling high-velocity, small- caliber smokeless cartridges. Designed by inventor James Paris Lee, the rifle weighed 8.3 pounds (3.7 kg) and was about 48 in (122 cm) long. It was the first American military rifle to be loaded by charging an (optional) en bloc clip of five 6mm cartridges into the rifle magazine, similar to the Mannlicher clip system (except the Mannlicher required the clip to operate). Lee later claimed in an unsuccessful lawsuit that his single-row clip-loaded magazine patent was infringed by von Mannlicher, but most historians agree that Mannlicher and Lee independently developed their en bloc magazine systems along separate but parallel lines. After inserting the clip, it was then given a second push to ready the first round for chambering. Closing the bolt stripped off each round in succession, feeding the next cartridge into the chamber. The clip itself dropped free from the magazine when the first cartridge had been loaded. Unlike the M1892 Springfield (Krag) and the later M1903 Springfield rifle, the Lee straight-pull did not have a magazine cut-off to enable the cartridges in the magazine to be held in reserve in keeping with the prevailing small arms military doctrine of the day (for use in rapid-fire, close-range combat only, fed single rounds the rest of the time). The Chief of Ordnance considered the Lee clip to be superior to either the Mauser stripper clip or the Mannlicher en bloc clip, as cartridges were not required to be stripped from the clip into the magazine (like the Mauser 'stripper clip' system), yet the Lee clip was not an essential part of the magazine (like the Mannlicher system), since it dropped out after the first cartridge was loaded, and since single cartridges could be loaded into an empty or partially loaded magazine to replace cartridges fired (unlike the Mannlicher). This conclusion was in conflict with the Naval Small Arms Board, which did consider the Lee clip to be an essential part of the magazine. When specifying the requirements for its new service rifle, the Navy emphasized that it desired a repeating rifle loaded by means of chargers or clips, but \\"since the conditions of service may require the use of loose cartridges, or may result in the disabling of the magazine, it is desirable that the small arm be susceptible of use as a single loader, and that the magazine be capable of being replenished by single cartridges. The new Lee rifle and its magazine met all of these requirements, enabling a rifleman in an emergency to use the loose cartridges taken from loaded belts supplied to machine gun crews for the 6 mm Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun. =Bolt mechanism= Along with the M1885 Remington-Lee and the M1892 Springfield, the M1895 Lee was one of the first infantry weapons adopted by U.S. forces to be equipped with a repeating action. To operate the straight-pull mechanism, the operating handle is first pulled up at an angle to disengage the bolt and its wedge lock, then pulled sharply to the rear to extract and eject the spent case. Pushing forward on the bolt handle strips a round from the magazine; as the bolt is slammed home, the bolt's wedge lock seats into place, the firing pin is cocked, and the fresh cartridge is seated in the chamber. Once the M1895 is cocked, the rifle's bolt cannot be retracted unless the bolt-release lever is pushed downward. This prevents opening of the action caused by an inadvertent bump or contact to the bolt handle. The rifle has a safety located on the top of the receiver, which is released by pushing down with the thumb on the safety button. Unlike many other military rifles of the day, the Lee was not fitted with a turning bolt. Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. Once the rather odd \\"up and back\\" bolt movement was mastered, and as long as the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired \\"with great rapidity\\",Sampson, W.T., The Annual Reports of the Navy Department, Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, October 1, 1895: Small Arms, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1895), p. 215-216: Using a seaman unfamiliar with the Lee rifle, and starting with loaded magazine and empty chamber, with the rifle at the shoulder and roughly aimed, the seaman was able to fire five shots in three seconds, and from 63 to 71 shots in two minutes using the five-round Lee clips. achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.Crossman, Edward C., The Rifle of the Hun, Popular Mechanics, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1918), p. 186: The M1895 Lee's rate of fire with its straight-pull action and charger loading was faster than most bolt-action rifles such as the M1898 Mauser, which had a rate of fire of five shots in eight seconds using a trained rifleman. =Sights and other features= The M1895 was equipped with a ladder-type rear sight adjustable to a maximum of 2,000 yards, determined by actual firing at Winchester in March 1896.Mullin, Timothy J., Testing the War Weapons, Boulder, CO: Presidio Press, (1997), pp. 332‚Äì333 Because of the relatively high velocity and flat trajectory of the 6mm Lee cartridge, authorities calibrated the sights at their lowest setting with a point-blank or dead aim range of 725 yards (663 m).Keeler, Bronson C., The Sentinel Almanac and Book of Facts, Vol. I, No. 1, The Milwaukee Sentinel Co. (1896) p. 139 The latter was intended for use on targets at all ranges from point-blank to 700 yards. The single battle setting was intended to discourage individual soldiers or marines from adjusting their sight elevation unless firing at mass targets at extreme ranges, in which case officers would give commands for ranges to be set in such situations. Owing to the necessity of supplying the Navy with rifles as soon as practicable, no provision for drift (windage) was included in the rear sight. The prominence of the front sight and its exposure to damage led to the adoption of a sheet metal front sight cover for the 10,000 rifles in the original order. The front sight cover was browned (blued) to reduce glare. Each rifle was tested at Winchester for accuracy by firing a group of three shots at 50 yards, any rifle not showing the desired accuracy was returned to the line for adjustment, which sometimes involved restocking the entire rifle. The rifle was equipped with a firing-pin lock on the left side of the receiver, which acted as a safety. Pushing down on the slide-type lever unlocked the firing pin striker and made the weapon ready to fire. With its slim-contour barrel, the rifle was slightly muzzle heavy. With practice it could be rapidly fired, recocked, and reloaded without taking the rifle from the shoulder. Contemporary reports and subsequent tests indicate that the M1895 and its ammunition were exceedingly accurate: target groups approaching a minute of angle at 100 yards were not unusual with individual rifles.James, Garry, Classic Test Report: Lee Navy rifle 6mm, Guns & Ammo (July 1985): A 1.5\\" group of five shots fired at 100 yards was recorded in a 90-year-old M1895 Lee rifle. The M1895 was normally issued with a sling, bandoliers, and a modern 8.18-inch (208mm) knife-type bayonet. Individual sailors and marines were issued a black leather belt with adjustable cross suspenders, fitted with twelve black leather ammunition pouches. The Lee Navy bayonet was the forerunner of short pattern bayonets still in use today.Canfield, Bruce N. 19th Century Military Winchesters March 2001 American Rifleman p.40 Ammunition In December 1894, after a series of test evaluations with both rimmed and rimless 6mm cartridges, the U.S. Navy adopted the 6mm U.S.N. or 6mm Lee Navy cartridge. It was the first U.S. military round to use a metric caliber in its official designation, the first cartridge designed for use in both rifles and machine guns, and the smallest-caliber cartridge to be adopted by any military power until the advent of the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge in 1964.Johnson (Jr.), Melvin Maynard and Haven, Charles T., Ammunition: its History, Development and Use, 1600 to 1943 -.22 BB cap to 20 mm. shell, New York: William Murrow & Co. (1943), p. 100 The original 6mm ball loading was supplied by Winchester, and used a roundnosed, cupro-nickeled steel-jacketed lead-core bullet with a total weight of 135 grains.Beyer, Henry G., Observations On The Effects Produced By The 6-mm Rifle and Projectile, Vol. 3, Boston Medical Journal, Boston Society of Medical Sciences (1899), pp. 117‚Äì136 In March 1897 a new military loading was adopted using a 112-grain (7.3 g) round-nose, copper-jacketed (FMJ) military loading developing and of energy at the muzzle.Sharpe, Philip B., The Rifle In America (2nd ed.), New York: Funk & Wagnalls Co. (1947), pp. 235‚Äì236Newton, Charles, Outing, Ballistics of Cartridges: Military Rifles III, Outing Publishing Co. Vol. 62 (1913), pp. 370‚Äì372 Besides providing increased velocity and a flatter trajectory, the primary reason for the change in cartridge and bullet design was to reduce chamber pressures and extend the life of the rifle barrel: the new 112-grain loading with its copper-jacketed bullet gave an average barrel life of 10,000 rounds as opposed to only 3,000 for the 135-grain steel-jacketed load. Ordnance authorities specified a slightly slower rifling twist for the new loading ‚Äì one turn in 7.5 inches (18 cm). At some point during later production, this rifling was again changed to one turn in 10 inches RH (25 cm).Mann, Franklin W. (Dr.), The Bullet's Flight From Powder to Target: The Internal and External ballistics of Small Arms, New York:Munn & Co. Publishers (1909), p. 303 The U.S. 6mm Lee Navy (6mm U.S.N.) cartridge used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps was initially supplied by Winchester Repeating Arms (WRA) and later, the Union Metallic Cartridge Company (UMC). The rifle powder was Rifleite, a nitrocellulose flake powder supplied by a British company, the Smokeless Powder Co. Ltd. The cartridge was semi-rimmed, and was designed to function in machine guns such as the M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning as well as in infantry rifles.The New York World, The World Almanac and Encyclopedia: Rifles Used by the Principal Powers of the World, Vol. 1 No. 4, New York: Press Publishing Co. (January 1894), p. 309 Intended for primarily for shipboard use against enemy naval forces in small boats, the 6mm Lee had considerably more penetrating power than the U.S. Army's .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) cartridge, and could perforate 23 inches (58 cm) of soft wood at 700 yards (640 m), a single 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) thick steel boiler plate at , or a 0.276-in. (7 mm) plate of chromium steel (no backing) at 150 feet. Another advantage to the 6mm cartridge was in the reduced weight of the ammunition: 220 6mm cartridges weighed approximately the same as 160 cartridges in .30 Army caliber.Sage, William H. (Maj.), and Clark, H.C. (Capt.) (ed.), Journal of the United States Infantry Association, Washington, D.C.: United States Infantry Association, Vol. IV, No. 4 (January 1908), p. 520 The basic combat ammunition load of an 1898 naval bluejacket or marine was 180 rounds of 6mm ammunition packed five- round clips, and carried in black leather ammunition pouches.Reid, George C. (Maj.), The Annual Reports of the Navy Department, Report of the Secretary of the Navy, Report of Inspection of the Marine Battalion at Camp Heywood, Seaveys Island, Portsmouth, N.H., September 14, 1898: Accouterments [sic], Vol. 3753, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1898), pp. 847‚Äì849: At Guantanamo, the Marines carried 180 rounds (36 chargers or clips) of 6mm ammunition in black leather pouches attached to their service belts.Converse, George A. (Commander) et al, The Annual Reports of the Navy Department, Annual Report to the Secretary of the Navy: Report of Naval Small Arms Board, May 15, 1895, Washington, D.C.: United States Navy Dept. (1895), p. 309: The Navy originally planned to use disposable ammunition boxes attached to the seaman's leather service belt, to be constructed of light metal or paper/wood composites, and packed with 160 rounds (eight 5-round chargers per box); this idea was later dropped in favor of conventional black leather ammunition pouches.U.S. Marine in 1900 Period Uniform , U.S. Navy 1895 Winchester-Lee Rifle, retrieved 14 November 2011 Outfitted in this manner, a navy bluejacket or marine could carry considerably more ammunition than that of the typical Army trooper of the day, who usually carried 100 rounds of .30 Army ammunition in individual cartridge loops on his Mills canvas cartridge belt. However, the 6mm U.S.N. cartridge may have been too advanced a concept for the technology of the day. The Navy experienced continued problems with the Rifleite smokeless powder used in the cartridge, which appears to have varied in consistency from lot to lot, while becoming unstable over time. These problems were exacerbated by the custom of keeping ammunition aboard ship for long periods under conditions of high heat and humidity. After some use, many Lee rifles developed bore and throat erosion, and metal fouling due to unburned powder compounds, a problem intensified by substandard internal barrel finishing at the factory.Metcalf, V.H., Report of Small Arms Target Practice: Report of the Captain of the Navy Rifle Team, Leavenworth, Kansas, September 6, 1908, Navy Dept., Washington D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1908), p. 38 The M1895 Lee was also the only military rifle to use Metford rifling, which British authorities had discarded because of its tendency to wear too easily when used with the smokeless powders of the day.Seton-Karr, Henry (Sir), Rifle, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.), New York: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Co., Vol. 23 (Ref ‚Äì Sai), (1911), p. 327 Naval and Marine service use The M1895 Lee was carried aboard Navy ships for use by naval armed guards (bluejackets) and landing parties, and was the standard service rifle for enlisted Marines, both seaborne and guard forces. Fifty-four USN Lee rifles were recovered from the USS Maine, which was sunk in Havana harbor in 1898.Sterett, Larry S., Straight-Pull Rifles, The American Rifleman, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (February 1957), pp. 30‚Äì32Relics Recovered From the USS Maine , retrieved 15 November 2011 These were eventually sold to Bannerman's, a military surplus dealer. Surviving examples seen of the confirmed Maine rifles have pitted receivers, which would be logical considering the salt water immersion in Havana Harbor. After the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the M1895 was issued to marines of the First Marine Battalion aboard the naval transport USS Panther, commanded by Lieutenant- Colonel Robert W. Huntington.Daugherty, Leo J., Pioneers of Amphibious Warfare, 1898‚Äì1945: profiles of fourteen American Military Strategists, McFarland Press, , (2009), pp. 22‚Äì27 As far as is known, all Marine companies involved in the Cuba combat operations were equipped with the 6mm Lee rifle. In addition to service with the First Battalion, additional rifles were later distributed by navy quartermasters to elements of free Cuban forces revolting against the Spanish government.Millett, Alan R., Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps, New York: Simon and Schuster Inc., , 9780029215968 (1991), pp. 131‚Äì133 The Marine assault force had only just been issued their Lee rifles, and enlisted men aboard the Panther were hurriedly given lectures on operating and field-stripping their newly issued rifles aboard ship, along with ten 6mm rounds each to fire for familiarization purposes.Keeler, Frank and Tyson, Carolyn A. (ed.), The Journal of Frank Keeler, 1898, Washington, D.C.: Marine Corps Letters Series, No. 1, Training and Education Command, (1967), p. 14, 18, 33, 38, 46 During a four-day call at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and later during a two-week stopover at Key West, Florida Lt. Col. Huntington ensured that all enlisted Marines aboard the USS Panther underwent target practice on the beaches with the Lee rifle, as well as marksmanship training and small-unit battle drills. This last-minute opportunity for target practice and training proved fortuitous, as Cuban guerrillas later handed Lee rifles had some initial difficulty operating and using them, while Lt. Col. Huntington's Marines had no such problems. The first major combat use of the M1895 occurred during the land campaign to capture Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba from June 9‚Äì14, 1898 with the First Marine Battalion, in particular at the battles of Camp McCalla and Cuzco Wells. During the battle of Cuzco Wells, Marines using the M1895 Lee effectively engaged concentrations of Spanish troops at ranges up to 1,200 yards, using volley fire against groups of enemy soldiers while their officers called out the range settings. Though some problems were noted with the new rifle, the flat ballistics, accuracy and rate of fire of the M1895 and the light weight of its 6mm ammunition proved to be of considerable benefit during offensive infantry operations over mountainous and jungled terrain against both Spanish regulars and loyalist guerrilla forces. The extra cartridges proved useful when early ammunition resupply from Navy ships was disrupted at the outset of the Guantanamo operation, allowing Marines to continue their assault even while individually resupplying Cuban rebels who had run short of ammunition.Keeler, Frank and Tyson, Carolyn A.

During the Moro Rebellion of 1899‚Äì1913, it was reported that some Marines preferred the M1892/98 Springfield (Krag) rifle and its .30-caliber ammunition to the M1895 Lee Navy and its 6mm U.S.N. cartridge, believing the latter to have inadequate shocking or stopping power against frenzied bolo- wielding Moro juramentados, who attacked from jungle cover at extremely close distances.Alexander, Joseph H., Horan, Don, and Stahl, Norman C., Battle History of the U.S. Marines: A Fellowship of Valor, New York: HarperCollins, , (1999), p. 24Arnold, James R., The Moro War: How America Battled a Muslim Insurgency in the Philippine Jungle, 1902‚Äì1913, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, , (2011), p. 95 In this situation, the 6mm Lee bullet may have overpenetrated without causing sufficient shock and trauma to the enemy, a situation which the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance had foreseen as early as 1895, when he acknowledged the concern that \\"the wounds produced by small-caliber bullets will frequently not be sufficient to put the wounded out of action and their shock will not stop the onset of excited men at short range\\".Heinl, Robert D., Soldiers of the Sea: The United States Marine Corps, 1775‚Äì1962, Nautical & Aviation Pub Co of America, , (1991), p. 189Dieffenbach, A.C., (Lt.)

(1897), pp. 321‚Äì323 On the other hand, the Marine Legation Guard, which used the 6mm U.S.N. cartridge in the defense of the foreign legations in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, apparently had no such criticisms.Simmons, Edward H. and Moskin, J. Robert,The Marine, Hong Kong: Marine Corps Heritage Foundation, Hugh Lauter Levin Associates Inc., (1998), p. 158 U.S. forces equipped with the Lee rifle in the first (Seymour) relief expedition advancing from Tientsin to relieve the Marines at Peking were able to transport some 10,000 rounds of 6mm ball for the riflemen as well as a Colt machine gun crew, and consequently never ran short of ammunition, unlike other Western forces, who were forced to capture the Imperial Chinese arsenal at Hsiku to find enough cartridges to continue fighting.Wurtsbaugh, Daniel (Lt.), The Seymour Relief Expedition, Washington, D.C.: Naval Institute Proceedings, United States Naval Institute (1902), pp. 207, 218 During the same expedition, Marine sharpshooters using the Lee Navy rifle managed to eliminate the gun crews of two heavy artillery batteries using only rifle fire. However, the service life of the M1895 as a first-line infantry weapon was soon to end. In December 1898, a board of officers from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps recommended that all services adopt the .30 Army cartridge and the small arms and machine guns chambered for it.Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy: Report of the Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, p. 26Mordecai, A. (Col.), \\"U.S. House of Representatives, Annual Reports of the War Department For the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1899: Proceedings of a Board of Officers of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, December 8, 1898, Appendix 49, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, (1899), pp. 531‚Äì532 The board did acknowledge that the rimmed .30 Army round was less than ideal when used in modern machine guns, and that the decision to adopt the .30 Army for the Navy and Marine Corps might be postponed until a rimless version of the .30 Army had been developed. The board's recommendations were later adopted by the War Department. In the end, the Navy and Marine Corps decided not to wait. As early as November 1899, the Navy placed its first contract for 1,000 Model 1892/98 \\"U.S. Army magazine rifles\\" in .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) caliber, with the first M1892/98 rifles issued to the newest pre-dreadnought battleships Kearsarge and Kentucky. New contracts for M1892/98 rifles were let as the U.S. Navy continued to expand, though the M1895 Lee and its 6mm cartridge would continue to see service aboard Navy vessels well into the turn of the century.United States Congress, The Story of Panama: Excerpts From the Log Book of the USS Dixie, Rep. Henry D. Flood, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, p. 434: As late as October 1903, ships at the New York Navy Yard were still receiving ordnance stores of \\"Ball Cartridge, 6mm\\" in amounts outnumbering that of .30 caliber ammunition. The U.S. Marines continued to use the M1895 Lee rifle until January 1900, when they received Model 1892/98 rifles in exchange (Philippines and Far East Marine battalions were the first to receive the new rifle and ammunition).Root, Elihu, Elihu Root Collection of United States Documents: Report of the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, United States Magazine Rifles, Caliber .30, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (September 29, 1900), pp. 1096‚Äì1097 The Navy continued to use the M1895 Lee as its primary small arm through at least 1903. From 1910 to 1911, both the M1895 Lee and the M1892/98 \\"Krag\\" service rifles were supplanted in Navy and Marine Corps service by the new M1903 Springfield rifle in .30-06 caliber,McCawley, Charles L.

Vote-OK came into being in 2005 through the efforts of Gloucestershire farmer Charles James Mann, his wife Carole (nickname 'Chipps'), and Jeremy Sweeney, a former lobbyist. Charles Mann, a longstanding pro-hunt campaigner and Beacon Co-ordinator during the Liberty and Livelihood campaign marches, ran the Action Office for the Countryside Alliance between 1997 and 2005 but was required to step down because of legislation regarding electoral campaigning. The group stands as a single issue lobby group and is a Registered Recognised Third Party, one of only 11 in the country. Its main aim is to galvanise and organise more people to get involved in political campaigning in order to defeat any Members of Parliament who voted in favour of the Hunting Act 2004. Their tactic is to aid other candidates in any constituency where the sitting MP supported a ban in order to bring about a government that will repeal the Hunting Act. This usually means supporting the Conservative Party candidate. They did not focus efforts in campaigning against the fox hunting ban itself but provided extra volunteers during the campaigning stage of the election. They became involved in telephone canvassing, leafleting and other activities as required. Vote-OK is a group of active campaigners which includes Lord Mancroft, co-ordinating support in marginal constituencies. Vote-OK head office consists of half a dozen people supporting Vote-OK Directors allocated to target constituencies. Liaising closely with the local candidate, the Directors role is to organise volunteers in the most effective way. Vote-OK is independent and are working with Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru Candidates. Vote-OK's rural origins as a campaign solely to repeal the Hunting Act are not emphasised, on the basis that it is not considered a 'vote winner'. As Simon Hart put it, \\"It would be much cleverer if we never mentioned hunting at all... We've got to go into these constituencies campaigning on health, education, crime.\\" Both Charles Mann and Simon Hart, who stepped down as Chairman of the Countryside Alliance in August 2019 to take up a ministerial role in the Cabinet Office, confirm that there are no current links between the two campaigning organisations. 2005 general election They targeted 139 seats (out of a total of 646 contested in the election). After the election the group claimed to have helped defeat 29 MPs as well as reducing the majorities of 21 anti- hunting MPs to under 3%, although anti-hunt groups such as Save Our Wild Animals dismissed this claim as \\"ludicrous\\". Members of Parliament who they have claimed to have helped defeat include David Rendel (Liberal Democrat) of Newbury, Peter Bradley (Labour) of The Wrekin who was the Parliamentary Private Secretary of Alun Michael, the minister in charge of handling the ban, and Helen Clark (Labour) of Peterborough. It is difficult, however, to separate out such local swings from the national swing in the election. 2010 general election Vote-OK stated it had helped more than 30 pro-hunt MPs win or keep seats. Conservative leader David Cameron had pledged to give a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act if he won, but within the coalition that won this was not possible. 2015 general election The Independent reported that they believed candidates Angie Bray (Ealing Central and Acton) and Ben Howlett (Bath) accepted help from Vote-OK. Alex Chalk (Cheltenham) received help from Vote-OK.

They live in the savanna plains of Venezuela called the Llanos, located west of the Orinoco River.\\"Yaruro.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 14 Sept 2013. The Pum√© people are divided into two subgroups: The River Pum√©, living along major river drainages of the Orinoco River, and the more nomadic Savanna Pum√© that reside on the Llanos. Name The word \\"Yaruro\\" was employed by early Spanish explorers and colonists to refer to the Pum√© and is still commonly used in Venezuela. The term has been used by neighboring indigenous groups such as the Guahibo, Hiwi, and Chiricoa, who likely are the source of this name adopted by the Spanish. \\"Yaruro\\" probably derives from the verb \\"yoro\\" in the Pum√© language, that means \\"to give\\". The term \\"Yaruro\\" is pejorative, referring to requests for material goods or food from outsiders perceived as wealthy by the Pum√©, and its meaning can be glossed in American English as the \\"Gimmees\\". The people refer to themselves as the Pum√© (meaning \\"real human\\") which also serves as the name of their language. \\"Yaruro\\" has been replaced by \\"Pum√©\\" in most anthropological literature and by some Venezuelan government use that is sensitive to indigenous issues. They have historically also been known by other names such as Llaruro, Yaruru, and Yuap√≠n people. Culture =Language= The Pum√© language is unclassified, although it is considered a Macro-Chibchan language. Some good linguistic research has been published on the Pum√© language. It is widely spoken by the Pum√© people today, especially among Savanna Pum√© who are primarily monolingual. Most River Pum√© populations have at least some members, primarily men, who are bilingual in Spanish and Pum√©. Portions of the Bible were translated into Pum√© in 1999. =Housing= The Savanna Pum√© are a mobile group of hunter-gatherers who shift their primary residence during every dry and wet season. They live in small brush shade structures during the dry season, and more robust structures thatched with palm leaves during the wet seasons. In addition to these two major seasonal moves, the Pum√© make temporary camps for fishing, raw material collection, and to stage the moves to their primary wet and dry season camps. River Pum√© were formerly slightly nomadic (although not as much as the Savanna Pum√©), but currently are sedentary. Many River Pum√© now construct more hybrid forms of architecture combining traditional and Criollo-influenced materials and designs. =Subsistence= alt= The Savanna Pum√© are primarily hunter-gatherers who subsist on distinctly different diets during each of the dry and wet seasons. The River Pum√© are horticulturalist who also practice some fishing, hunting and wild plant collection. Savanna Pum√© men hunt primarily small terrestrial game during the wet season such as armadillos, tegu lizards, other small lizards, and rabbits. Men very infrequently obtain larger game such as capybara, deer, anteaters, or caimans. All hunting by Savanna Pum√© is done with bows and arrows. Women collect several wild tubers, that are the main food during the wet season. Both sexes also perform some garden work that brings in complementary manioc as a dietary supplement without reducing their foraging for wild plants. Gardening is typical of swidden systems used by many tropical peoples throughout the world, however Savanna Pum√© gardens are quite small compared with those of the River Pum√© or other South American groups. In the past, foraging for turtle eggs was reported but is very uncommon today, possibly because of over-exploitation during the last 200 years. Other past game animals such as hunting for manatees are recognized as potentially edible, but no recent reports of their consumption are reported by the Pum√©. During the dry season, Pum√© men fish using bows and arrows, hook and line, and fish poison. The dry season also offers opportunities for bird hunting and capture of small numbers of turtles and tortoises. Women, accompanied by some men, collect feral mangos in prodigious quantities during the dry season as well as a few other species of small fruits that are much less important. River Pum√© have less seasonal variation in their diet. They rely more on a diversity of cultivated crops, can fish year round in the major rivers, hunt and gather some foods, and may work in wage labor jobs for the local Criollos. River Pum√© successfully raise small numbers of chickens and pigs, animals rarely husbanded by Savanna Pum√© for more than a couple months before being consumed during periods of hunger =Material culture= The Savanna Pum√© population manufactures most of their material technology, except some market items obtained through trade, primarily with River Pum√© who have greater access to these market goods. Items such as cooking pots, steel knives, machetes, shovels, and used clothing are the primary outside goods obtained by the Savanna Pum√© through trade. Other desired market items include matches, tobacco, nylon hammocks, whetstones, and other tools. Bicycles first became common in 2006. Given the economic difficulties in Venezuela, it is unclear whether the Savanna Pum√© even have the minimal access seen in the early 2000s to some of these goods. Some River Pum√© communities are the beneficiaries of government programs that include some provisioning with manufactured products. Savanna Pum√© construct their houses primarily from materials collected in the llanos; wood, palm leaf thatch, and vines used to tie together the house framework. Moriche palms (Mauritia flexuosa) are the critical resource needed for palm thatch, roofing material, as well as other significant technologies. Their distribution is an important factor in the amount of land needed by Savanna Pum√© to schedule future moves from areas with depressed availability of moriche and other palm raw materials. Some zinc lamina has been available for roofing, and is extensively re-used during camp moves. Architectural wood and thatch is often moved along with camps to re-build new structures. Traditional architecture is still common in Savanna Pum√© communities, although modern construction materials increasingly dominate River Pum√© house construction. Fibers made from moriche palm leaves as well as whole leaves, are some of the most important raw materials used by the Savanna Pum√©. The River Pum√© primarily use fibers from macanilla palms (Astrocaryum jauri). Palm leaf fibers are used to make string, rope, hammocks, basket containers, basketry mats, and many diverse woven containers and objects for subsistence, storage, and other critical technologies. Collection of this raw material is most common in the dry season when women process and accumulate the fine fibers from palm leaves needed for string/rope construction and weaving. Palm raw materials and products remain important trade items within Pum√© culture, both among Savanna and River Pum√©. alt= Women's subsistence technology includes carrying baskets made from whole palm leaves with tumplines for carrying, wooden digging sticks, and digging sticks with steel tips. Women may include synthetic feed sacks for carrying plant foods (especially for the collection of feral mangos and manioc), or cloth sacks or clothing as additional carrying additional resources. Most gathering of root foods involves only the use of traditional palm leaf baskets. Wet season collection of wild tubers uses untipped wooden digging sticks, because the primary tubers (Dracontium margaretae) are close to the ground surface. Steel tipped digging sticks are primarily used for collection of deeper-growing tubers (mostly Myrossma cannifolia), late in the wet season and during parts of the dry season. Women use these same technologies in gardening. Both men and women also use small shovels and machetes for garden work and harvesting. Men's subsistence technology, at least for Savanna Pum√©, uses bows and arrows for terrestrial hunting and much fishing, modern fishing line and hooks (if available through trade), specialized harpoons or arrows for caimans or turtles, as well as knives and machetes. Bows are made from palm wood (Astrocaryum jauri.) and are long (~2 m) as are most South American native bows. Bowstrings are made from a semi-cultivated bromiliad fiber (Ananas lucidus). Arrows, (also ~2m long) are made from domesticated arrowcanes, wooden foreshafts, fletched with anhinga feathers, and constructed with bromiliad fiber and a manufactured tree resin (Symphonia glubulifera). Scavenged, traded, and re-used pieces of metal are used for arrowpoints, probably at least since the mid 19th century. Bone is reported to have been used before metal was as common, and two wooden-tipped bird arrows are still occasionally employed. Some River Pum√© men have access to guns for hunting. Because most hunted foods in the savannas are burrowing game (armadillos, tegu lizards, and small ameiva lizards), machetes and especially bows often are used as digging implements to capture these game. During the dry season, small rafts made from moriche plalm leaf stems are used to search for caimans and turtles in seasonal lagoons. River Pum√© use dugout canoes for fishing, pursuit of caimans, and turtles in the major drainages of the llanos, as well as for transportation. The Pum√© manufacture a wide array of other traditional implements from string, woven materials, and wood. Manufactured clothing and cloth has been readily available to the Pum√© since at least the 19th century, and probably much earlier. Although western style dress is common among all Savanna and especially River Pum√©, among savanna dwellers some traditional elements of women's clothing have persisted and some older men recently still eschewed pants in favor of loincloths. =Kinship and personal names= alt= Traditionally, the Pum√© do not use names, but employ kin terms to reference each other. Even nicknames are not used. All Pum√© people have Christian names used to interact with the local Criollo population, or given to them by the Venezuelan government for census or other administrative purposes, but they do not use them among themselves. These names may rarely be used when referencing people from distant communities where kin terms do not precisely identify a person. Spanish names used by Savanna Pum√© often change throughout childhood and some adults' names also vary during their lifespan. Spanish names are sometimes used when speaking to or about children below the age of approximately 14, primarily because kin terms may not specifically identify particular young people. The Pum√© use a Dravidian form of Dakota-Iroquois kinship classification. =Marriage= By the age of 15, most Savanna and River Pum√© girls are married. Boys also marry young, but the early marriage of Pum√© girls is particularly important as a demographic indicator of relatively rapid maturation in response to living in an environment with low food availability, high disease exposure, and potentially high risks of mortality. Pum√© girls work less than girls in comparable hunter-gatherer populations, allowing them to potentially spend more calories on growth rather than on foraging effort, and thus reach sexual maturity at a younger age. This may lengthen their reproductive lifespan, compensating for their shorter life expectancy and their high infant and later childhood mortality rates. Although early marriage is the general practice for Pum√© hunter-gatherers, there is no evidence of coercion of girls to marry or begin sexual relations before they feel ready. Marriage involves no formal ceremony, exchange of goods, or overt negotiations among adults. It simply consists of establishing co-habitation by the couple. There is some influence of parents on choice of marriage partners, but it is a very flexible system. A small percentage of men have more than one wife, who are usually sisters (sororal polygyny). Among both Savanna and River Pum√©, infidelity is uncommon and is cause for divorce. Compared with many lowland South American indigenous groups, the Pum√© have low rates of infidelity and divorce among both men and women. =Religion and medicine= The Pum√© engage in frequent all-night dances called toh√© for religious and social purposes. These 11-hour dances are held 3-4 nights a week throughout the year. Among the Savanna Pum√©, all members of the camp are present in the plaza area of camp for these dances. Smaller River Pum√© communities also hold village wide-dances, but larger River communities often have separate dances attended by extended families that represent only a segment of the larger group. The toh√© dance involves verse and response singing during the entire night, and increased frequency and speed of circulation around a central pole erected each dance night in the dance plaza. An area on the western side of the plaza is where non-dancing participants watch the toh√©. A male dance leader performs the majority of the singing and leads the energetic dancing. Many men also sing primary verses and the chorus responses. Women are an important part of the dance, singing the choruses, joining in the dancing around the central pole, and perform specialized dance steps several times a night at most dances. Dance songs are partially formulaic but include significant amounts of improvisational singing. They are rhythmically and melodically complex compositions. Men accompany the dance with rattles, the only musical instrument used by the Pum√©. Dances can involve healing events for particular individuals suffering from physical diseases and psychological distress (depression, grief, frustration). Dances can also lead to trance- states by the dance leader or other individuals. Trances involve possession by spirits or deceased Pum√© individuals. The possessed individual speaks through those personages to the community as a whole or to particular individuals about events of current concern to the camp or person singled out for contact. No food is consumed during dances, but prodigious amounts of tobacco are smoked by men, women, and children. Men also take hallucnogenic snuff in group bouts during the dance (Anadenanthera peregrina) and sometimes chew a second hallucinogen (Banisteriopsis caapi). The Pum√© consider the toh√© dance to be one of the central institutions of their culture along with their indigenous language. The toh√© dance has an important role in group solidarity and in reinforcing the cooperative structure of Pum√© life (especially among Savanna Pum√©) that appears to be a critical adaptation to life in this challenging and seasonally food-impoverished environment. Some formerly reported ceremonials are apparently no longer practiced. The names of these ceremonials are familiar to Savanna Pum√© but their forms are no longer known. A specialized women's ceremony that is still common among both Savanna and River Pum√© is the a√±iku√≠ toh√© (little sister toh√©). Among Savanna Pum√© this is an all-night singing bout performed by older women. An individual woman performs this singing on her own from her hammock over the same time period as the community wide toh√© dance, from approximately sunset until sunrise. River Pum√© women normally conduct the a√±iku√≠ toh√© during the daytime and it often is of shorter duration than the Savanna Pum√© version. Savanna Pum√© women only do the little sister toh√© during the evening and it always lasts the entire night. The a√±iku√≠ toh√© is much less frequently sung than the community-wide dances among the Savanna Pum√©. Because the River Pum√© version can be much shorter and is a daytime curing ceremony, it has more often been observed by ethnographers. The Savanna Pum√© little sister toh√© is always performed during an evening when the community toh√© is held. Savanna Pum√© women singing the a√±iku√≠ toh√© sing continuously for 11 hours with no break from the performance. They may smoke tobacco during the evening from their hammocks, but not as prodigiously as the leader of the community dances. No musical instrument is used by women during their singing of the rhythmically and melodically complex little sister toh√© song cycles. The purpose of the a√±iku√≠ toh√© appears to be similar to the stated reasons for the community wide toh√©, for curing, and for personal insight into current issues or problems affecting the community, the singer, or her family. The practice of the a√±iku√≠ toh√© demonstrates the importance of women in Pum√© society and remains an important cultural element of the Savanna and River Pum√©. The Pum√© have a number of effective plant-based medicines that are used in treating a range of illnesses and minor traumas. They make unguents that aid in the healing of cuts, other wounds, and skin irritations, and prepare other medicines for pain, snakebite, and other maladies. Other medicinal chants, touching, and the commonly observed \\"sucking-cure\\" may offer psychological help for minor ailments and normal fluctuations in mood. Community support for ill or distressed individuals likewise may be a rational and effective means of promoting health and psychological healing. All Pum√© are aware of the efficacy of western medicines and desire greater access to them. :See also Puana, a goddess in Yaruro mythology. Outside pressures The Pum√© have had contact with Europeans since at least the 17th century. The greatest amount of contact has been among River Pum√© communities because they are located on the primary transportation routes within the llanos. Early missionary work and subsequent development has resulted in dramatic changes among groups nearest to population centers of non-Pum√©. The lack of significant economic development in much of this region has left most Pum√© communities minimally affected by some of the rapid changes affecting traditional populations in other parts of Venezuela and throughout the world. This is especially true of Savanna Pum√© who live away from the major tributaries of the Orinoco River. All Pum√© have experienced changes in many areas of their life, especially during the 20th century. Increased occupation of some parts of the llanos occurred from the 1960s onwards. Opportunities for wage labor brought access to market goods, but also introduced alcohol, evangelical Christian missionary influences, and conflicts with some Criollos (but certainly not all) that were considered undesirable outcomes of greater contact with the larger Venezuelan culture and economy. In some highly acculturated Pum√© communities, problems from the introduction of alcohol have resulted in few or no tohe performances and village participation in dance, an outcome considered socially destructive by community members who still value this vital aspect of Pum√© culture. Most Pum√© communities do not have clear land ownership rights to the areas that they occupy. Mandates under the Chavez administration prioritized land tenure as a goal for helping indigenous populations throughout Venezuela. This program has realized variable successes throughout the country, however only some Pum√© communities have been given legal protection of some or all of their lands. The Pum√© themselves express a desire for the protection of their lands from potential encroachment. They also emphasize the importance of preserving their traditional culture, language, and dance as well as access to some outside assistance such as medical attention, tools, and other market goods.

West Oakland is a neighborhood situated in the northwestern corner of Oakland, California, United States, situated west of Downtown Oakland, south of Emeryville, and north of Alameda. The neighborhood is located along the waterfront at the Port of Oakland and at the eastern end of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. It lies at an elevation of 13 feet (4 m). History The land which comprises part of West Oakland was granted to Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. In the 1850s, a group of men who had been leasing the land from his son Vicente, Horace Carpentier, Edson Adams, and Andrew J. Moon, began illegally selling small farm plots west of what is now Market Street.Bagwell, Beth. Oakland, The Story of a City, 1996, Oakland Heritage Alliance, 2nd ed. One of the squatters, Horace Carpentier became Oakland's first mayor in 1854. The population grew after 1863, when the San Francisco-Oakland railroad connected central Oakland to the San Francisco bay ferries. In 1869, West Oakland became the terminus of the transcontinental railroad, and the population grew again as railroad workers settled in the neighborhood. In the 1880s and 1890s, a large number of shops and small and medium-sized houses were built to accommodate the large number of European Americans, African Americans, Portuguese, Irish, Mexicans, Japanese, and Chinese immigrants who settled in West Oakland. Many African Americans were employed as porters for the Pullman Palace Car Company, and the headquarters of their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, was at 5th and Wood Streets. The writer Jack London lived in West Oakland in the late 19th century, and his novel The Valley of the Moon is set in West Oakland. Many of the houses built in that period are still standing today and make up the quaint character of the neighborhood. Oakland's baseball team, the Oakland Oaks, played at the Oakland Baseball grounds West Oakland in 1879. In 1906, many people left homeless by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake settled in West Oakland. The original wooden train station at 16th and Wood Streets was replaced in 1912 by a large Beaux Arts structure which is still standing, though it was severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. World War I brought new job opportunities in the shipyards and with it an influx of workers and business growth. By 1930, West Oakland was a thriving, predominately African-American neighborhood of about 2,800 residents. Seventh Street was lined with jazz and blues clubs. Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association had its West Coast headquarters at 8th and Chester Streets. West Oakland experienced a decline in the Depression in the late 1930s, and some residential areas became dilapidated. In the 1940s and 1950s, dozens of blocks were bulldozed and replaced with public housing projects. The 1940s and World War II saw a new influx of workers for the shipbuilding industry and the newly constructed Oakland Army Base and Naval Supply Center. As the railroads declined and Americans turned to the automobile for transportation in the 1950s, many employees moved away. When the Cypress Freeway, a double-decker freeway connecting the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge with the Nimitz Freeway, was built in the 1950s above Cypress Street, it effectively split the neighborhood in half and isolated it from downtown Oakland. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, block after block was razed and thousands of residents were displaced for the building of the massive Oakland Main Post Office, the West Oakland BART Station, and the Acorn Plaza housing projects. These projects coincided with a period of economic decline characterized by unemployment, poverty, and urban blight. West Oakland was also home to the first Mexican and Latino community in Oakland. Fleeing the Mexican Revolution, Mexicans started settling in West Oakland in the 1910s. Mexican and Puerto Ricans also settled in West Oakland to work on the railroads, at the port, and in industry, and opened many local businesses. In World War II the Latino community grew as Mexicans from the Southwestern United States settled in West Oakland to work in wartime industries Also 5000 Braceros came to Oakland to work in the Southern Pacific Railroad West Oakland yard. In the 1950s and 1960s, urban renewal, construction of the Nimitz Freeway, and BART displaced most of the Latino community which settled in the Fruitvale and East Oakland areas. West Oakland became a primarily African American neighborhood, with a small Hispanic population. Oakland Museum Latino History project http://www.museumca.org/LHP/ Groups of African American residents of West Oakland mobilized to resist the \\"urban renewal\\" projects during this period. The Black Panthers grew out of this resistance and West Oakland became the center of the Black Panthers in the late 1960s. Their main office was on Peralta Street, and they distributed free breakfasts to children in St. Augustine's church on West Street. DeFremery Park was the site of Black Panther rallies and social programs. Huey P. Newton was convicted of manslaughter after allegedly shooting an officer on 7th Street, and Newton himself was killed in 1989 by a drug dealer in West Oakland. The east end of the Transbay Tube is located in West Oakland. =1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to the present= In the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, the Cypress Freeway collapsed. 42 people were killed despite rescue efforts by West Oakland residents. West Oakland residents successfully resisted efforts to rebuild the freeway in the same location. With the freeway now removed, West Oakland started to undergo gentrification. Cypress Street was renamed Mandela Parkway, a recently finished wide thoroughfare with a pedestrian path and greenway in its median, including a park commemorating the 1989 earthquake. It is lined with condominiums and new and established businesses. Several of the surrounding warehouses now serve as artist studios. Most notably the former facilities for American Steel are now Big Art Studios, a unique facility for large-scale artists. Several pieces of work by the constituent art groups within can be found on display outside the complex. Mandela Gateway, a mixed retail and residential development at the south end of Mandela Parkway, surrounds the West Oakland BART station. The old Victorian houses are being refurbished, and new condominium, townhouse, and live-work loft residences have sprung up. The growth of Emeryville on the border of West Oakland, West Oakland's proximity to San Francisco via the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge and BART, and the slightly more affordable rental and home prices have attracted many new residents. Environment Environmental racism is when a particular group (most often racial minorities or those with specific disadvantages) is subject to dangerous pollutants and deprived of access to basic resources such as clean air, water, healthy groceries, etc. In West Oakland, a case study revealed that the predominantly African American and Latino neighborhoods in this area were exposed to disproportionate levels of diesel exhaust from 6,300 container trucks that frequented this route on their way to and from the Port of Oakland and a prominent US Post Office distribution center. Air pollution generated from traffic and truck idling is tied to early asthma onset in children, and approximately 64 pounds of diesel particulate matter emissions were released into the air in a single day in West Oakland according to one study. Residents in the surrounding neighborhoods reported regular findings of diesel exhaust soot on windows and vents of their homes. In part to environmental racism, these people could be exposed to ‚Äò‚Äò90 times more diesel particulates per square mile per year than the state of California.‚Äô‚Äô In light of this information, community organizers called together a case for a new truck route ordinance that would re-navigate container trucks and their harmful emissions away from the neighborhood. Currently, the community is more engaged in environmental decision-making to protect their families.

Geography  Bay of Yalobi, Waya Island Sandbar connecting the islands of Waya and Wayasewa Nanuya Lai Lai The Yasawa volcanic group consists of six main islands and numerous smaller islets. The archipelago, which stretches in a north-easterly direction for more than from a point north-west of Lautoka, is volcanic in origin and very mountainous, with peaks ranging from in height. The only safe passage for shipping is between Yasawa Island (the second largest in the archipelago, about long and less than a kilometer wide) and Round Island, 22 kilometers to the north-east.  History  The British navigator William Bligh was the first European to sight the Yasawas in 1789, following the Mutiny on the Bounty. Captain Barber in visited the islands in 1794, but they were not charted until 1840, when they were surveyed and charted by a United States expedition commanded by Charles Wilkes. Throughout the 1800s, Tongan raiders bartered for, and sometimes stole, the sail mats for which the Yasawas were famous. The islands were largely ignored by the wider world until World War II, when the United States military used them as communications outposts.  Tourism, economy and culture  Until 1987, it was the policy of the Fiji government that the Yasawa Group was closed to land-based tourism because the king of the Yasawa Group, who was not controlled by the government, did not want tourism. There were limited cruise operations since the 1950s, but passengers had to stay aboard their ships. Without tourism, the local residents lived in peace and harmony in a communal atmosphere. Since the Fijian government lifted the restrictions on land-based tourism in the Yasawa Group, a number of resorts have been established there. Due to its freehold real-estate status, three budget resorts have been operating on Tavewa island since the early 1980s.  Access  The Yasawa Flyer connects Port Denarau with the Yasawa Islands. As one of the outer island chains, options to get to the Yasawa Islands are a bit more limited than some of the closer islands to Nadi and Denarau. Sea planes from local airlines (like Turtle Airways) make multiple flights to the Yasawa resorts per day, and charters are also available. Helicopter charters are also available or one can take the Yasawa Flyer, a catamaran.

The new regime, condemning Ould Taya's government as \\"totalitarian\\", promised to lead the country to elections and the restoration of civilian rule within two years; a referendum on a new constitution was planned to be held within a year, and parliamentary and presidential elections would follow. Vall and the other members of the military council agreed not to run for president.Hademine Ould Sadi, \\"Mauritania's new junta keeps on winning friends\\" , Middle East Online, August 8, 2005. The coup was greeted with widespread support within Mauritania, but outside the country there was sharp condemnation. The African Union (which suspended Mauritania's membership), the European Union, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, and the United States all condemned the coup. However, this opposition weakened after several days and the regime appeared to win tacit international acceptance.Hademine Ould Sadi, \\"Military rulers in Mauritania win AU backing\\" , Middle East Online, August 10, 2006. Vall maintained Mauritania's diplomatic relationship with Israel. Mauritania and Israel initiated full diplomatic relations in 1999 under Taya, a decision which contributed to the latter's unpopularity. After the coup, Ahmed Ould Sid'Ahmed, who had been Foreign Minister at the time diplomatic relations were established, was reappointed to the position.Ahmed Mohamed, \\"Freed Islamic leaders in Mauritania say ousted leader's policies fomented extremism\\" , Associated Press, August 10, 2005.

Vall announced that he would step down after the March 2007 presidential election.Daniel Flynn, \\"Interview-Mauritania junta chief hails new democratic era\\", Reuters, November 21, 2006.

The military under General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz seized power again in August 2008, ousting Abdallahi, and a new presidential election was planned. Vall announced on 6 June 2009 that he would be a candidate, running as an independent. He condemned the 2008 coup, asserting that it was \\"wrong and there was no reason for it\\" and that it had \\"provoked a particularly dangerous situation in our country\\". He stressed, however, that his candidacy was not directed against any particular individual, and he said that his goal, if elected, was \\"to build a reconciled country that is politically and economically viable and stable\\". He also said that he would \\"probably no longer be interested in public affairs\\" if not for the 2008 coup.\\"Past junta leader to run for Mauritania president\\", AFP, 6 June 2009. Official results showed Vall performing poorly in the election, which was held on 18 July 2009, while Abdel Aziz won a majority in the first round.

Although founded as a \\"first edition\\" bookstore, its focus today is solely poetry. A small (), one- room store with towering bookcases, it claims to be the \\"oldest continuous bookshop\\" devoted solely to the sale of poetry and poetry criticism. Over the years, the Grolier became a focus of poetic activity in the Cambridge area, which had become a magnet for American poets because of the influence of Harvard University. Poets such as John Ashbery, Robert Bly, Robert Creeley, Donald Hall, and Frank O'Hara were regulars at the store during their time as undergraduates at Harvard; the poet Conrad Aiken lived upstairs from the store in its early days. Numerous other poets and writers, including Russell Banks, Frank Bidart, William Corbett, E. E. Cummings, T. S. Eliot, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, David Ferry, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Marianne Moore, Charles Olson, Robert Pinsky, Adrienne Rich, Ruth Stone, James Tate and Franz Wright, have been noted as \\"friends of the Grolier.\\" History  The Grolier Book Shop was founded in September 1927 by Adrian Gambet and Gordon Cairnie. The subsequent owner, Louisa Solano purchased and took over its operation in 1974 after Cairnie's death. The poet-bookseller Arthur Freeman negotiated the sale. In 1990, the Grolier Book Shop became the Grolier Poetry Book Shop, Inc. for tax reasons. Financially comfortable, Gambet and Cairnie were able to run the business at a loss and were known to give away books and turn a blind eye to theft. Much of the activity at the Grolier under Cairnie's management was of the social kind. Under Solano's ownership, Grolier became a self-sustaining business with aims to expand the general public's interest in poetry and to honor the diversity of voices. The shop's initial means of support included appraisals and a mail order business, an annual undergraduate poetry reading with poets from fifteen colleges, and autograph parties, beginning in 1974 with featured poets such as Gary Miranda. In 1983, the Grolier Poetry Prize Annual was first published. Both readings and ANNUAL were now supported by the Ellen La Forge Memorial Poetry Foundation, formed in 1983 by Jeanne Henle in memory of her sister and inspired by Jim Henle, a friend of the shop. It also funded the costs of six poetry festivals. There was also a basketball and a baseball team organized by the poet Peter Payack.Poets & Writers Newsletter April-May 1980 Brady, Kathleen In its last years under Solano's management, the shop remained a source for rare or obscure titles. The store was the first in New England to stock Language Magazine, the periodical that launched the avant-garde L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement.

Grolier is listed as a \\"poetry landmark\\" by the Academy of American Poets. In 2004, Solano announced that, due to poor health and a decline in sales, the Grolier had to be sold.Provost, Claire. \\"Grolier Book Shop To Close,\\" Harvard Crimson (March 16, 2004). The causes of the shop's decline included the reach of the internet, inventory management, and the encroachment of chains. In March 2006, the store was sold to Nigerian poet Ifeanyi Menkiti, a professor at Wellesley College. In September 2012, the Grolier Poetry Book Shop celebrated its 85th anniversary, a celebration that continued until September 2013.

Originally appearing on the Top Cow solicitation schedule as a monthly title, to date only 6 issues and one trade paperback have ever been published. The 2000 publication year saw the release of issues 1 and 2. Before issue number 3 was released in early 2001, Finch was replaced with artist Clarence Lansang (the issue features artwork by both artists), yet only two more issues would be published during Lansang's tenure (number 1/2, a place-holder issue recapping previous story events and containing ten pages of \\"pin-ups\\" by various artists, and number 4 which continued the story but did not finish it). Aphrodite IX still appears on the Top Cow website as a \\"current\\" publication, although Wohl has since moved on to other projects. A trade paperback, Aphrodite IX: Time Out of Mind, collecting all extant issues, was released in 2003. =Aphrodite IV= An android similar to Aphrodite IX, identified as Aphrodite IV, appeared in a page from Top Cow's ongoing series Cyberforce. An Aphrodite is featured on the cover Witchblade #119, where she is shown wielding the Witchblade itself. The Aphrodite is confirmed to be IV, the same one stalking the Cyberforce. The cover, showing Aphrodite IV wielding the Witchblade, may seem a bit misleading, as she does not actually wear the Witchblade in this issue. During the Artifacts limited series, Aphrodite IV is hired by an unknown person who desires to bring all Thirteen artifacts together. =Vol. 2= Top Cow released a free preview issue for Vol. 2 of Aphrodite IX on May 4, 2013, with the first new issue released in June 2013 and the 11th and final issue released in July 2014.https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/aphrodite-ix-11 The preview is set in the distant future of the previous issues in the series. The artist of the series is Stjepan ≈†ejiƒá. Plot Aphrodite IX is a female android who suffers from amnesia shortly after being sent on undercover missions. This leads to ongoing confusion about what she does and for whom. Although she becomes aware that she is intended as an assassin, she finds the idea increasingly distasteful and experiences dreams and desires like a human. This begins to undermine her morale but not her efficiency, for her conditioning takes over as her masters or survival circumstances require. When she seeks out clues to her past and true identity, she stumbles onto a conspiracy involving a secret society of cyborgs attempting to undermine the legitimate government. Main characters Aphrodite IX ‚Äì Aphrodite IX is a self-aware gynoid designed to carry out undercover missions of infiltration and assassination. Although she has been trained to kill, Aphrodite IX retains no memory of her actions; her brain is designed to experience an episode of amnesia at the end of each mission, apparently to protect her masters if not herself. The character's appearance is her trademark: Kelly green makeup and hair (including an oversized spot on one cheek), form-fitting outfits ringed with ammo belts, thigh-high lug soled boots. She typically carries a very large knife on her belt and one or more large guns. In other media An anime of Aphrodite IX was being developed, but aside from a trailer released at the Top Cow booth during the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con, nothing ever came of the project.

A.S.a.P. released an album in 1989 entitled Silver and Gold. A.S.a.P. stands for \\"Adrian Smith and Project\\", and the full name of the band is incorporated within the band logo, with each word written in tiny font underneath the corresponding letter in the abbreviation. History Adrian Smith formed the band in 1989 when Iron Maiden was taking a year break after spending almost a year on the road for the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album tour in 1988. The band had its origin in Urchin, a band Smith fronted in the 1970s. Andy Barnett, Dave Colwell and Richard Young played with Smith in various incarnations of Urchin, which was disbanded in 1981 when Smith joined Iron Maiden. Further foundations for the band were laid out in late 1985 when Iron Maiden were taking a break after their massive world tour in support of their album Powerslave. Bored with the lull in band's activity as they prepared to record a new album, Adrian Smith and Nicko McBrain started playing on their own to pass the time, and they soon formed a full band which included Colwell and Barnett. Along with some other musicians they knew, they went to play a one-off gig at London's Marquee Club in 1986, under the name of \\"The Entire Population of Hackney\\". At the show, the band performed mostly original material, including the songs \\"Silver and Gold\\" (which would later become the title track of their only album, \\"Fighting Man\\", \\"School Days\\" and \\"When She's Gone\\" (all of which would later be recorded by A.S.a.P. and released as B-sides to its singles) at the show, as well as three songs that would later be recorded by Iron Maiden (\\"Juanita\\", \\"Reach Out\\" and \\"That Girl\\"). When he formed A.S.a.P. in 1989, Adrian Smith invited his friends and former bandmates Colwell, Barnett and Young, as well as Zak Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Originally, Smith wanted Nicko McBrain to join on drums, but McBrain was getting married at the time and was unavailable for recording. Their first and only album was a departure from the sound Smith helped create with Iron Maiden. It was not as heavy as Iron Maiden although there were elements of the more progressive sound the band had developed over the 1980s, but keyboards were more prominently featured than in Iron Maiden's music. It also featured Smith in the role of lead singer. His voice has a somewhat husky, working class feel to it comparable to Bryan Adams. The album was a commercial failure, despite the promotional tour and two singles, and the band soon ceased to exist. In 1990, Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden during the writing of their album No Prayer for the Dying, due largely to creative differences with Steve Harris. Despite staying on good terms with the band, the departure from Iron Maiden led Smith to a decision to quit the music business altogether, and between 1990 and 1993 he performed live only once, as a guest star with Iron Maiden at a one-off show in Donington in 1992. In 1993, Smith formed a band called The Untouchables, with the idea of playing only small club shows. The Untouchables never released any records, and by 1994, they evolved to Psycho Motel, which recorded two studio albums and toured with Iron Maiden in 1996 and 1997. In 1997, Smith joined Bruce Dickinson's backing band and eventually they both rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999.

Early life and education Naimi was born in Ar-Rakah in the Eastern Province. Born to Ibrahim, a pearl diver of the Al-Naimi tribe, and Fatima, a Bedouin of the Ajman, his parents became divorced during the pregnancy. As a consequence, Naimi was born into and lived the first eight years of his nomadic life with his mother's and stepfather's tribe. From the age of four, he tended the family's flock of lambs. His mother divorced his stepfather when Al-Naimi was eight, and Al-Naimi left the Ajmani tribe to live with his father in Al-Hasa. Ali Al-Naimi's older brother Abdullah, was hired by Aramco in 1944, and attended the Jebel School run by the company. Abdullah took Ali along, where they learned English, Arabic and basic arithmetic in the mornings, then worked as office boys in the afternoon. Finally, on 6 December 1947, Ali was hired as a junior clerk, but still attended school in the mornings. Under the training programs of Aramco, he studied at International College, Beirut and the American University of Beirut, before going to Lehigh University in the United States. He obtained a bachelor of science degree in geology in 1962. He then earned a master of science degree in hydrology and economic geology at Stanford University. Ali attended advanced management courses at Columbia in 1974 and Harvard in 1979. Career After graduation, Naimi joined Aramco's exploration and production department as a geologist in 1964. He presented his first research paper, The Groundwater of Northeastern Saudi Arabia, in 1965. In 1967, he spent a year in the public relations department, before being assigned as the senior supervising operator for the Abqaiq Field in 1968. There he used an innovative gas injection method to revive the Ain Dar, No. 17, well. On 1 April 1969, Ali was made superintendent, assistant manager in 1972, and then manager in 1973. He was promoted to manager of Northern Area producing in 1974, which had responsibility for 11 of Aramco's 15 oil fields. On 1 May 1975, the Aramco board promoted Ali to be the vice president for producing and water injection. He was one of the leaders that initiated seawater injection as a replacement for well water. He was named president of Aramco Overseas Company before becoming a senior vice president in July 1978. Al Naimi was elected a member of board of directors in 1980 and was promoted to the newly created position of executive vice-president of oil and gas affairs in 1981. He was named president of Saudi Aramco in November 1983, being the first Saudi to hold that position. In 1988 Al-Naimi assumed responsibilities as CEO. He became the minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources on 2 August 1995 (his 60th birthday), replacing Hisham Nazer. Al- Naimi became the first oil executive to hold the office. He was succeeded by Abdullah S. Jum'ah as CEO of Aramco. Also in 1995, Naimi received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University In December 2010, the Saudi Supreme Petroleum Council, chaired by King Abdullah, asked Naimi to nominate candidates to succeed him as oil minister. In November 2014, still serving as Saudi oil minister and therefore the de facto leader of OPEC, Naimi became the primary advocate for the export organization's controversial new strategy. He argued that the oil market should be left to rebalance itself at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding OPEC's long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US shale oil production. In 2016 he announced that in the next years more investment will be made in renewable energy and solar technology, as he sees great potential in this area. Naimi completed his service as oil minister in May 2016, as deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman took on a stronger role in Saudi oil policy. Naimi was replaced by former executive at state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco Khaled Al-Falih. In 2016 Naimi published his memoirs with the title ‚ÄúOut of the Desert‚Äù. The book gives insight into the domestic infighting and the future of Saudi Aramco. =Other positions= Naimi is chairman of the board of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). =Recognition= Ali received an honorary degree from Seoul National University and there is an A. I. Naimi Road at S-Oil's Onsan refining complex. Naimi was named one of the most influential people in the world by TIME magazine in 2008. In 2011, he was included in the inaugural 50 Most Influential ranking by Bloomberg Markets magazine. His autobiography was published in November 2016.

Paul Nitsche was born on November 25, 1876 in Colditz, Saxony. His father Hermann Nitsche was a psychiatrist. He attended elementary school in Pirna (German: Volksschule) from 1882 to 1887. He was condemned to death for crimes against humanity for killing over one thousand people, and executed by guillotine in March 1948 in Dresden. Career Nitsche received his medical license in 1901 and a professorship in 1925. Nitsche did not join the Nazi Party until May 1933. He was a strong supporter of eugenics and euthanasia and was present at the gassing demonstration at what would become the Brandenburg euthanasia center in either December 1939 or January 1940. He was driven not so much by Nazi racial ideology as by his own support of racial science and his vision of \\"progressive medicine\\". Being well established, Nitsche was no longer motivated by the prospect of career advancement but was rather ideologically committed when he later joined Action T4. Euthanasia He was deputy director of the Sonnenstein Clinic from 1913 to 1918 and director of the institution 1928 to 1939. In 1940 he became deputy director of the Action T4 Medical Office (German: Medizinische Abteilung) under Werner Heyde, which had a front organization called the Reich Cooperative for State Hospitals and Nursing Homes (German: Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft Heil- und Pflegeanstalten) that handled the registration, evaluation, and selection of patients for adult euthanasia. As the T4 program's chief physician, Nitsche was responsible for corresponding with mental health institutions about registering and transferring patients to be euthanized. He succeeded Heyde as head of the Medical Office in December 1941. Trial and execution He was arrested on March 11, 1945. His trial took place from June 16, 1947 to July 7, 1947. He was condemned to death for crimes against humanity on the basis of Allied Control Council Law No. 10 for killing over one thousand people. He attempted to justify his actions, saying they were intended to free the sick from pain. He was executed by guillotine on March 25, 1948 in Dresden.

It is part of the Ortsbezirk West and is subdivided into the Stadtbezirke Zeilsheim-Ost, Zeilsheim-S√ºd and Zeilsheim-Nord. As the westernmost district of Frankfurt, Zeilsheim is somewhat rural in character and the surrounding fields can give a clear view of the Taunus mountains. Geography Zeilsheim borders Kriftel in the west, Liederbach am Taunus in the north, the district of Unterliederbach in the northeast, H√∂chst in the east, and Sindlingen in the southeast. In the north and west, it is bordered by the Bundesautobahn 66 Wiesbaden-Frankfurt. =Infrastructure= The main street of the district is the Landesstra√üe 3018 that lead through the L 3016 from Kelkheim through Unterliederbach, through Zeilsheim until Hofheim am Taunus. It is sometimes nicknamed the Pfaffenwiese or the Hofheimer Stra√üe (Hofheim Street). It is also a major street used in public transport. Zeilsheim is linked by bus to the observation tower in Bockenheim, to Griesheim and to Niederrad, as well as by regional bus lines to Schwalbach am Taunus und Hofheim. Settlement A settlement in Zeilsheim was initiated by Hoechst AG to provide worker housing located near its factories. A similar settlement is Heimchen in Unterliederbach. The main street of the settlement was called Neu-Zeilsheim. Nearly all of the intersecting streets are ordered alphabetically. Today in the center lies a church erected in 1912. On the western borders stands the building of the K√§the-Kollwitz School erected in 1902. Taunusblick und M√§rchensiedlung In the north and southeast of the district arose the settlements Taunusblick (Taunus view) and M√§rchensiedlung (Fairy tale settlement). The name of the northwestern settlement derives from the ability to see the Taunus mountains on a clear day. M√§rchensiedlung is located south of the main road. The name refers to fa√ßades of the houses that contain images from the stories of the Brothers Grimm. History The district was first founded as the independent town Ciolfesheim in 794. In 1917 it was incorporated into the city of H√∂chst. In 1928 it was incorporated along with H√∂chst into Frankfurt proper. Zeilsheim became famous for its camp created by the Allies to hold Displaced Persons and exiles after World War II, and in 1946 it was visited by Zionist leader (later Israeli prime minister) David Ben-Gurion and former American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. A small monument in the park behind the city hall is dedicated to the memory of this community. There is also a small museum with alternating exhibitions on the district's history. Administration It is divided in into three districts itself, North, South and West (Nord, S√ºd und West).

It was published by Top Cow Productions in the 1990s. The production changed hands after issue #4. Publication history Weapon Zero launched in June 1995 with a five issue mini-series prologue. This prologue deviated from traditional numbering of each comic in that it started with #T-4(T minus 4) and counted down to #0. It was followed up in March 1996 with an ongoing series that lasted 15 issues. Plot =Prologue= Three astronauts are sent to investigate strange energy readings received from the moon's dark side. They discover a hidden base of aliens called the T'srri. Unrah and Juarez are killed, and while Col. Tyson Stone escaped, he is infected with T'srri bio-tech, namely a master logic module. When he returns home, his wife Lorelei reveals herself as a Batai, an alien race who had been at war with the T'srri. She cleanses Stone of the T'srri mindworm that was starting to take over him.Weapon Zero #T-4, June 1995 Meanwhile, the T'srri on the base begin to awaken from cold sleep. These are actually humans who had been abducted over a period of 2000 years. They are now being converted by the bio-tech to serve as T'srri. Three children and a dog escape this process: Kikuyo, Jamie, Valaria and Janus are physically altered and gain unique powers, but retain their identities. Back on Earth, Lorelei explains to Stone a little of the war and that new warriors were being sought to fight the T'srri. They are interrupted by N'golth, the T'srri commander of the moonbase, who has come to reclaim the master logic module as he needs this in order to summon the main T'srri force through a dimensional gate. Lorelei faces N'golth and is killed.Weapon Zero #T-3, August 1995 N'golth then takes Stone back to the base, and attempts to extract the module from his brain. However Stone escapes using Lorelei‚Äôs battle-staff, which merges with him to become a symbiotic armour. He teleports to Earth taking the kids with him. N'golth makes preparations to create a new module from scanned data, and also has Lorelei reanimated as a T'srri.Weapon Zero #T-2, September 1995 Lorelei tracks Stone through the energy signature of the teleport, and attempts to capture them. However they escape, and this time hide their signal from her. They locate the crash site of two warships which had collided and fallen to Earth, and obtain an anti-matter device on board. They return with this hoping to destroy the T'srri base, but are recaptured and Lorelei reclaims her armour from Stone.Weapon Zero #T-1, October 1995 By this time, recreation of the module is complete, and N'golth uses it to summon the T'srri Seneschal to Earth. He shows off Lorelei to the Seneschal and explains his intention to fully convert Stone and the children into T'srri as a unit, with Lorelei placed as commander. He names this unit Weapon Zero. Meanwhile, Janus shape-shifts out of his restraints and releases the others, and Stone finds that he can regenerate another version of his lost Batai armour. Weapon Zero attacks and damages the gate before the waiting T'srri can come through. To prevent his failure being reported, N'golth attempts to kill the Seneschal, who escapes back through the gate. N'golth is unconcerned, as he is sure the damaged gate will scatter the Seneschal into atoms. Meanwhile, Stone faces Lorelei, and activates the anti-matter device still in her armour. Weapon Zero teleports away as the base explodes.Weapon Zero #0, December 1995 =Arsenal Of Democracy= Stone brings the kids to his home, but it explodes due to a Batai security measure left by Lorelei. Finding that none of Stone's friends and neighbours know who he is, they camp outside for the night and in the morning meet an army squad led by Major Arbuckle, who have been sent to investigate after the explosion at the site of Stone's mission to the moon. They are interrupted and captured by a covert organisation calling themselves the Arsenal Of Democracy, who have arrived for the same reason.Weapon Zero #1, March 1996 They bring Weapon Zero to a secret facility beneath the Potomac river and brainwash Stone into working for them. When Weapon Zero break free, he is sent against them.Weapon Zero #2, April 1996 However, Stone has been feigning his indoctrination in order to buy his team-mates time to regroup. They rescue Arbuckle, who sets off a locator beacon for his squad to find them. They escape the base, surface on the river and are rescued by helicopters. When the army later returns to investigate the Potomac, they find no sign the base had ever been there.Weapon Zero #3, May 1996 =Japan= Weapon Zero travel to the Kofuku clan territory, Kikuyo's family, in hopes of finding treasure with which they can support themselves. On arrival, they find the grounds of Kofuku castle have been taken over by the Yakuza.Weapon Zero #4, June 1996 After a brief confrontation, they flee, and Kikuyo leads them through a secret tunnel. They head to the hills behind the castle, to a cemetery where Kikuyo locates a hidden compartment within a false grave. Instead of treasure they find Kofuku family heirloom, a samurai's ancient armour. After they camp for the night, Kikuyo slips off alone to think. She meets an old woman and several more Yakuza, and learns that many of the Yakuza here are descended from the Kofuku clan. Kikuyo introduces Weapon Zero as her new family, and they depart on good terms. Before she leaves, Kikuyo lets her clan know where to find the Kofuku heirloom. The grateful clan present Weapon Zero with a Swiss bank account.Weapon Zero #5, July 1996 =Ansh'r= Weapon Zero are attacked by Lorelei's father Ansh'r, apparently in a bid for revenge for his daughter's death.Weapon Zero #6, August 1996 However he turns out to be testing Stone's combat capability, as well as testing his reactions to determine whether he was compromised by the T'srri tech. Having satisfied himself of Stone's integrity, he teleports Weapon Zero to his ship, The Regulus.Weapon Zero #7, September 1996 There, he secretly runs a similar test on the children while he explains to Stone the events of the Batai/T'srri war. With this done, he introduces them to Lorelei's twin sister, Lilith.Weapon Zero #8, November 1996 He then informs them all of the threat posed to Earth by a Berserker, an incredibly powerful T'srri foe which crash landed in Roswell in 1947. It was transported to a secret facility, Area X, and has now awoken. He also explains no-one can remember Stone because all traces of Lorelei, and the associated memories, have been removed from time. Weapon Zero teleport to the facility to face the Berserker.Weapon Zero #9, December 1996 =Devil's Reign= In the Marvel Universe, the demon Mephisto discovers a crashed T'srri warship and uses it to create a dimensional rift into the Top Cow Universe. He observes Weapon Zero battling the Berserker and surreptitiously starts feeding power into it, causing it to become ever larger and more powerful. Faced with a now unbeatable foe, Ansh'r makes the choice to teleport the Berserker and himself into space. Lilith is now left to guide the team, and she teleports them back to The Regulus. At this point, Jamie, who had never integrated well with his team-mates, abandons them by leaping out of the teleport field and ends up in Los Angeles. Mephisto meets and allies himself with N'golth and his aide Erisha. Erisha poses as human and takes the name Trisha in order to introduce herself to Jamie and use him for their purposes.Weapon Zero / Silver Surfer #1: Devil's Reign Chapter 1, January 1997 She pushes Jamie's anti authoritarian tendencies in order that he would start gathering like-minded youths for Mephisto.Elektra / Cyblade #1: Devil's Reign - Chapter 7, March 1997 Weapon Zero arrive in LA looking for Jamie, but when they try to link to The Regulus' computer to aid them, they find the ship has disappeared. Lilith then transports them to Lorelei's secret base, Tartarus, within the Sangre de Cristo mountains, where they renew their search.Weapon Zero #10, February 1997 They locate Jamie at a shrine constructed by Mephisto in the California desert, where he is posing as Jesus Christ calling out for everyone present to pledge their souls to him. When he spots Weapon Zero he strengthens his argument by using his powers to activate their battle forms, exposing them as ‚Äòdemons‚Äô. However his hold on the people is broken when he himself is exposed by the Silver Surfer, who arrives via the rift. The Surfer joins the fight with Weapon Zero against Mephisto‚Äôs hordes until he is ultimately defeated by Heatwave. Meanwhile, Jamie and Erisha slip away.Silver Surfer / Weapon Zero #1: Devil's Reign - Chapter 8, April 1997 =Gen-13= During the continuing search for Jamie, Valaria gets separated from the group and is befriended by Gen-13, who help her defend against the T'srri when they try to reclaim her.Gen-13 Bootleg #4, February 1997 =The Amalgaman= While Erisha delivers Jamie into N'golth's hands, Weapon Zero detect a T'srri presence on the moonbase. They start exploring the relatively undamaged sections of the base, and encounter The Amalgaman, a formidable T'srri combat team.Weapon Zero #11, April 1997 The resulting battle proves to be one-sided, with The Amalgaman easily overpowering Weapon Zero, and soon Stone alone is left standing. At this point N'golth, Erisha and the now T'srri-converted Jamie arrive at the base. N'golth withdraws The Amalgaman, and sets Jamie on Stone instead.Weapon Zero #12, May 1997 However Stone manages to turn the situation by pointing out that N'golth betrayed the T'srri Seneschal, prompting Jamie and The Amalgaman to turn on him. N'golth succeeds in killing The Amalgaman members individually but Jamie surprises him from behind. Jamie in turn is knocked out by Stone. Lilith purges the Mindworm from his body, and he returns to Weapon Zero.Weapon Zero #13, June 1997 =Finale= Ansh'r returns to warn Weapon Zero of an imminent invasion by the T'srri.Weapon Zero #14, September 1997 He is joined by several of his Batai comrades, who join forces with the American military against the T'srri in a battle in the skies of Denver. N'golth hijacks a T'srri fighter and rams into the Seneschal's cruiser, sending both ships crashing into the city. Lilith, Ansh'r and N'golth are killed in battle, while Stone and Kikuyo are critically injured. Outnumbered and soon to be overwhelmed, the battle ends when Jamie creates an explosion large enough to wipe out the T'srri ground forces.Weapon Zero #15, December 1997 Characters =Weapon Zero= The team known as Weapon Zero is composed of Stone, Jamie, Kikuyo, Valaria and Janus. Although they were all given code names by Ansh'r, they generally referred to each other by their original names. They are all failed T'srri conversions in that they have been implanted with the T'srri biotech, but retained their identities having not been taken over by a T'srri mindworm. These T'srri implants provide enough internal energy to power a small city, from which they have all gained unique powers. Abilities they have in common are their symbiotic armour and a lack of physical aging.Top Cow Book of Revelations, July 2003 They are also gifted with innate multilingualism. Colonel Tyson Stone (Ordnance) The de facto leader of Weapon Zero, and also effectively a father figure to his much younger charges. Stone's T'srri implants were restructured by Lorelei to provide power to the Batai technology in his armour. He can produce any weaponry he wishes from this armour as well as teleport himself and others from one location to another. Jamie Tarleton (Fist) Jamie was abducted by the T'srri while fleeing the press gang in England, though there is some conflict within the story about which city. He is initially established as being from Liverpool, but later referred to as coming from London. Jamie is a very reluctant member of Weapon Zero, and he runs away after a near-disastrous battle with the Berserker. He falls under the influence of a T'srri mindworm, until he is cleansed by Lilith and rejoins Weapon Zero. Ultimately he sacrifices himself to destroy T'srri forces attacking Earth. Jamie is able to focus energy into his hands and release it in a directed explosion. Although he mainly uses his fingers and hands, he has been shown on one occasion to use his foot. Kikuyo (Slice) Kikuyo was a clan princess from 16th century Japan. She was abducted while on her way to be married into another clan. Her disappearance sparked a war between the two families. Slice is able to produce sharp claws from the ends of her fingers. She has been shown to elongate her arms for a better reach with her hands. She also appears to have increased strength, as remarked on by one of her combatants. In addition, she has been taught by her father in martial arts. Valaria (Leviathan) Valaria is a Roman girl from Pompeii. The T'srri took her during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Valaria is able to transform into a large and powerful beast at will. This form bears a superficial resemblance to a T'srri Berserker, and indeed she was referred to as such by a T'srri combatant. Janus Valaria's pet dog from Pompeii, he was taken by the T'ssri when they took her. Janus gained the ability to speak from his T'srri augmentation. He is also able to change his body structure, including the ability to retract and grow his limbs at will. =Other characters= *N'golth: The primary antagonist within Weapon Zero. He is commander of the T'srri moonbase until its destruction, and makes several recurring appearances until he is killed by Stone in the final issue. *Lorelei: Stone's Batai wife, who is killed by N'golth and reanimated as a T'srri. *Major Jeremiah Arbuckle: Stone's army tutor and old friend. He is kidnapped by the Arsenal of Democracy along with Weapon Zero, and is instrumental to their escape. On parting he lends Stone his credit card, which he later cancels when his memory of them is erased, believing it stolen, though his memory is later restored. He reappears in the finale, apparently now working for or with the AOD. *Red: Stone's friend and neighbour. When first encountered, he has no memory of Stone sends him away at gunpoint. He later learns of the threat posed by the T'srri and is able to provide information, from his time in covert ops, relevant to locating the T'srri Berserker. Ansh'r then restores his memory. *Jeffo: Red's son. He is apparently mentally handicapped, and constantly expresses himself using Star Trek analogies. *Ansh'r: Lorelei's father who travels to Earth to aid Weapon Zero in their fight against the T'srri. He apparently sacrifices himself to defeat the Berserker, but returns at the finale where he is killed in battle. *Lilith: Lorelei's twin sister, who joins Weapon Zero partway through the series. She is initially very dismissive of Weapon Zero's fortitude, and resents them for the death of her sister and her father, to the extent that she actively attempts to kill them by letting them set off Tartarus' internal defences. She is persuaded not to squander her sister's legacy, and ultimately warms to the group. She is killed in the final battle.

It is located in the Municipal District of Smoky River No. 130, along Highway 49. Falher is one of the earliest agricultural communities in the Peace River Country.  History  The area was known to missionaries before it was surveyed in 1909 as an Indian trail that led to British Columbia and later where the railway laid its tracks. In 1912, the settlement of Mission St-Jean Baptiste de Falher was opened from the current location of the Town of Falher. When the railway came to the area in 1915, the settlement was named after Father Constant Falher, a Roman Catholic Oblate missionary who was born in Josselin, Brittany, France in 1863, arriving at Grouard in 1889. The origin of the majority of local colonizers were from Quebec; some arriving in the area via the United States of America (French American), such as Robert Goulet's family, who settled in the nearby francophone community. The colony was divided into two: what is now the Village of Donnelly and the Town of Falher. In 1919, the town consolidated a school district and the first parish of Ste. Anne was established. The first post office opened in 1923 when the settlement became a hamlet. It incorporated as a village in 1929 and then as a town in 1955.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Falher recorded a population of 1,047 living in 450 of its 482 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,075. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Falher had a population of 1,075 living in 497 of its 522 total dwellings, a 14.2% change from its 2006 population of 941. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Economy  Oil pumps next to Alberta Highway 2. The principal industries in the area are agriculture, forestry, oil and gas. Established in 1973 as a private business, Falher Alfalfa (an alfalfa processing facility) was sold to a group of producers and farmers in 1978 with the same company. Under normal circumstances, Falher Alfalfa employed a staff of about 35 full-time employees in the spring and 110 at the busiest time of the season. Falher Alfalfa went under the Company Creditor Arrangement Act in June 2007, protecting the company against any legal action taken by creditors and gave the company a chance to sell its product to be able to repay creditors. In spring 2008, Falher Alfalfa declared bankruptcy due to production costs.Smoky River Express. Falher Alfalfa closes after going into receivership  Government  The Town of Falher is governed by a mayor (Donna Buchinski) and five councillors who meet on the second Monday of each month. It is currently located in the riding of Peace River‚ÄîWestlock federally.  Arts and culture  Every year, a \\"Honey Festival\\" is held to pay tribute to the beekeeping industry which has created an impact in the Smoky River region and throughout Canada and the United States. The honey in the area is derived largely from clover seed operations. At its peak, more than 48,000 hives in the region produced 10 million pounds (4,500 t) of honey annually. Today the honey of the Smoky River Region is known worldwide. Falher attracted national attention in 2006 due to its high standing in the \\"Kraft Hockeyville\\" contest, a coast-to- coast competition to elect the municipality that most embodies the spirit of Canada's national pastime.  Attractions  Main Street Falher includes a large honey bee statue, as Falher is known as \\"Honey Capital of Canada\\". The statue was built by local welder, Richard Ethier and it measures , and its diameter is . There is also a tall slide next to an arena where the local hockey team, The Falher Pirates, play against other teams in the division.  Education  There are two public schools in Falher: *√âcole H√©ritage School√âcole H√©ritage School is a Francophone school that is located in a building that once served as a college school built by the Oblates in 1951. √âcole H√©ritage currently has students in grades K‚Äì12. *√âcole Routhier School is another educational institution in Falher. Routhier is an Anglophone and French immersion Elementary School which includes grades K‚Äì6. Students in grades 7-12 attend classes at √âcole Georges P. Vanier School in nearby Donnelly, Alberta.

In 1948 he corresponded with Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell, advocating world government. Life Walter Marseille was the son of Gustav Marseille, a leader in the progressive education movement. He studied psychology, mathematics, history, and philosophy at the Universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg, and Munich. In 1926 he took a doctorate under Martin Heidegger at Marburg University. Further information is given by his friend Karl L√∂with. From 1928 to 1933 Marseille followed the workshops (Arbeitsgemeinschaft) of Heinrich Jacoby in Berlin; his address was Dernburgstr. 34, Charlottenburg (Berlin).L√∂with, Mein Leben in Deutschland, p. 59. He later claimed to have broken with Heidegger in 1932 over Heidegger's refusal to condemn Nazism. L√∂with tells us that Marseille left Germany in 1933, went to Vienna where he married a woman of Jewish origin, and then emigrated to the United States. He trained as a psychoanalyst at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute and the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and took Ruth Mack Brunswick as his training analyst.Marseille correspondence with Einstein, 1948. Marseille also told Einstein that Ralph Fox of Princeton University was a good friend, and the mathematician, Hans Rademacher, had been his teacher thirty years earlier in Germany (which would have been at the University of Berlin, or possibly, if after 1922, at Hamburg). Marseille was hired by Paul Lazarsfeld in 1940 to analyse the handwriting of mail received by US Senators during the debate on the conscription bill,Science: Handwriting as Character, Time, 25 May 1942 and developed an index for the cultural rating of handwriting.The index was used in Rowena Wyant, \\"Voting via the Senate Mailbag\\", Public Opinion Quarterly 5 (1941): 359-82. In April 1948 Marseille sent a paper, \\"A Method to Enforce World Peace\\", to both Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. A copy of the paper is in the Einstein archives along with correspondence with Einstein about it. See Einstein on Peace (1960), edited by Otto Nathan. Einstein's four replies in the ensuing discussion were sold by Bloomsbury Auctions in October 2008. The lot description in the sales catalogue reads as follows: > 84\\\\.

Marseille was the recipient of a well-known letter dated 5 May 1948 in which Bertrand Russell signalled his agreement with the paper. Russell's letter, of which Einstein may have been the first to have been sent a copy, was first published by Marseille in The Nation, 16 Oct. 1954, when he disagreed with Russell's changed views on nuclear disarmament. The letter and its lack of context have been of concern to Russell scholars.The letter may be read in R.W. Clark, The Life of Bertrand Russell, pp. 523-4; Russell, Selected Letters (ed. N. Griffin), vol. 2, pp. 428‚Äì9; Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell (ed. R. Perkins), pp. 204-5; Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, vol. 28 (ed. A. Bone), p. 72; and it is discussed in Ray Monk's biography of Russell, vol. 2, pp. 299-303\\\\. Sidney Hook quoted the entire letter in his reply to M.S. Arnoni, \\"Arnoni vs. Hook\\", The New Leader, 23 Oct. 1967, pp. 34-5. By 1954 Marseilles was a Berkeley, California psychoanalyst. That year he contributed a series of radio programmes broadcasts attempting a psychoanalytic study of Karl Marx. He published occasionally on nuclear weapons policy in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, from 1954 until 1962.

Playing career Long was the starting quarterback for the New Mexico Lobos football team from 1969 to 1971, recording consecutive winning seasons and earning player-of-the-year honors in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 1971. His professional career began with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1972, with which he played 68 games in total. In 1974, he departed to the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League (WFL). That year, he intercepted three passes for 38 return yards, and returned 20 punts for 217 yards and 14 kickoffs for 402 yards. He returned to the Lions for three years and had one of his best years in 1975, when he intercepted a team high eight passes for 88 yards. A Western All-Star in 1977, Long also led the team in punt returns in his last three years, and is still the fourth leading all-time returner, with 1946 yards on 192 punt returns, with one touchdown.

His 65 wins are the most of any head coach in program history. Long surpassed Roy W. Johnson's mark of 41 wins during the 2005 season. Long led the Lobos to three straight bowl games from 2003 to 2005, a first in program history. The Lobos were bowl-eligible for seven straight seasons, from 2001 to 2007, another program record. This streak continued into the 2007 season as the Lobos accepted a bid to the New Mexico Bowl, where Long garnered his bowl win with a victory over the Nevada Wolf Pack. After an 11-season career, Long resigned on November 17, 2008, two days after the Lobos' regular game season ended. Long cited that he was not the right person to lead the program to newer heights. He added that he had no plans of retirement, and that he wanted to continue to coach as a coordinator. In 2011, he was promoted to head coach at San Diego State after two seasons as their defensive coordinator. In 2020, Long resigned from San Diego State, and Brady Hoke was named as his replacement. He left San Diego State with 81 wins, second all time in wins behind Don Coryell.

She averaged 12.9 points and 6.4 rebounds per game during her four-year Stanford career. As a senior, she was a Naismith \\"Player of the Year\\" finalist and named an Associated Press honorable mention All-American and was a Kodak All-Region selection.

Professional career  In the 1998 WNBA Draft, Scott was selected by the Utah Starzz in the second round (#11 overall). She missed most of the following season, due to the birth of her daughter on April 7, 1999. She returned to play in four games for the Starzz before she and teammate Wendy Palmer were traded on July 29 to the Detroit Shock, in exchange for Korie Hlede and Cindy Brown. She played for the Shock until just prior to the 2001 season, when she was traded to the Indiana Fever. Having been being used as a utility player since her WNBA debut, Scott became a member of the Fever's starting lineup for the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Scott was named team captain of the Indiana Fever and awarded the Community Assist award for excellence in community service and leadership by the WNBA and the Fever.

After that season, she was traded along with her Charlotte teammates Nicole Powell and Erin Buescher, to the Sacramento Monarchs in exchange for Tangela Smith and a 2006 WNBA Draft second-round pick. She spent the 2005 season with the Monarchs in a reserve role, but enjoyed the team's success as they went on to win the WNBA Championship, defeating the Connecticut Sun three games to one, in a best-of-five playoff. On February 3, 2006, Scott, who had been a free agent after the 2005 season ended, signed a contract to return to the Indiana Fever. She played one year with the Fever, then was traded again in March 2007 to the Phoenix Mercury where she enjoyed winning a second WNBA Championship.

The team's efforts resulted in Scott and her coaching staff being voted by the conference as the Liberty League Coaching Staff of the Year. However, after her Sacramento Monarchs team won the WNBA championship by defeating the Connecticut Sun, Scott resigned from her coaching position to devote herself full-time to her playing career.

Early life Koro≈°ec was born in Biserjane (then Duchy of Styria, Austria-Hungary, now part of Slovenia) and went to school in Ptuj and in Maribor. He studied theology and was ordained as a priest in 1895. He completed his education with a doctorate in theology from the University of Graz in 1905. He was friends with Janez Evangelist Krek and adopted his political views. Political career In 1907, Koro≈°ec was elected to the Reichsrat as a member of the Slovenian People's Party, where, as president of the Yugoslav Club, he read out the May Declaration, which called for all South Slavs to be unified in one state unit within the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, of which Koro≈°ec was the president, declared the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 29 October 1918. Earlier, Koro≈°ec and Nikola Pa≈°iƒá had agreed on the terms of the Geneva Declaration, in which the Kingdom of Serbia recognized the equal rights of the different components of such a state should it join with it in a confederation. From the very beginning however, Serbs favoured central control and the subsequent Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a unitary monarchy. Koro≈°ec was vice- president in the first government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918. As the leader of the Slovenian People's Party he later collaborated in two right-leaning governments. Despite its defeat in 1920, the Slovenian People's Party was again victorious in Slovenia in 1924 and Koro≈°ec was chosen to be vice-president of the government. In 1924 and 1927, he was also minister for the interior. Koro≈°ec opposed the adoption of the Vidovdan Constitution and campaigned for greater autonomy for Slovenes within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until the Slovenian People's Party joined with Serbian radicals to form a centralist government and the idea was sidelined. Following Stjepan Radiƒá‚Äôs assassination in 1928, in order to ensure more peace between ethnic groups the king called Koro≈°ec to lead the first government of Yugoslavia without a Serbian Prime Minister, but the monarch soon dismissed him when the :January 6th Dictatorship was proclaimed. Koro≈°ec was also a minister in Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá‚Äôs government in 1929. He tried to resolve the crisis in the country by democratic means, but the government fell in 1930 under pressure from Slovenia. In opposition, Koro≈°ec drew up the Slovenian Declaration (Slovenska deklaracija) which called for a new multinational union of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This proposal also seemed attractive to Slovenians living in the Slovenian Littoral and Carinthia, which bordered on the existing state. Koro≈°ec was exiled to the island of Hvar in 1933. The Slovenian People's Party subsequently boycotted the 1935 parliamentary elections. Koro≈°ec nonetheless was named minister for the interior in Milan Stojadinoviƒá's government in the same year. He helped to facilitate an agreement between Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá and Vladko Maƒçek and was minister for education in their government. While in Stojadinoviƒá's Government, Koro≈°ec advocated a policy of close relationships with Nazi Germany. As education Minister in the Yugoslav government of Macek-Cvetkovic, in October 1940 Koro≈°ec introduced two antisemitic laws. One limited the participation of Jews in the wholesale food industry, while the other put a limit on the number of Jewish students in secondary schools and universities. When other ministers objected to the laws, Koro≈°ec insisted that failure to introduce them would endanger relationships with Germany, and the laws were indeed accepted. Towards the end of his life, he openly spoke out against Freemasonry, Communism as well as Judaism. While serving Interior Minister in the Yugoslav government, Koro≈°ec, declared \\"all Jews, Communists, and Freemasons as traitors, conspirators, and enemies of the State\\". He also organised the anti- Communist organisation the Sentinel in the Tempest (Stra≈æa v viharju). Death Koro≈°ec died aged 68 in Belgrade (then Kingdom of Yugoslavia, now Republic of Serbia).

Fictional Biography War Angel is, literally, a \\"war angel\\", created by God to do one thing, make war. In the 2005 three issue mini series War Angel, set in the future in the year 2232 AD, Serenity (her real name), travels to what is left of Nevada to hide out and get some cash before heading off to Xexico. She gets in the middle of a drug war between vampires, warlocks and werewolves. She kills all parties involved, but doesn't get any money to show for her efforts. Even though she claims to have no conscience, she seems to have a soft spot for women in peril. She develops feelings for Scarlet, a siren captured by the head of the warlocks named Marax and made into his slave. After Scarlet tells her about being taken from her home and her wives, Serenity kills the warlocks guarding Scarlet so she can escape back to her home known as \\"The Hive\\". Scarlet gives Serenity an invitation to come visit her at the Hive if she makes it out of town alive. Serenity takes Scarlet up on her invite and is given shelter and companionship from Scarlet... and her wives. Serenity also tries to help a prostitute she hires for the night whom she calls \\"Blondie\\". After surviving an attack by the warlocks, she gives Blondie money and tells her to start her life over. Unfortunately Blondie is beaten to death inside the brothel by Samuel, the head of the vampire clan. In 2006, Lady Death vs. War Angel was published, giving a little insight to Serenity's origin. War Angel blames Lady Death for what has happened to her left hand. They fight to a virtual stand still. War Angel slightly gets the upper hand and is about to finish off Lady Death until Pandora intervenes and hits Serenity on the back of her head and teleports her away. In 2007, War Angel 0 was published, and gave yet more insight into the origin of War Angel. Serenity is upset over the fact God has not spoken to her in thousands of years (which contributes greatly to her personality) despite having done everything possible to get his attention. Serapiel, the angel of judgement shows up after seeing Serenity tie up a group of angels upside down in order to drink their tears. He brings with him a demon from hell to kill War Angel fearing she is the biggest threat of all. She disposes of them both and starts the great war that leaves the world in ashes. Powers, Weapons, and Abilities War Angel is a fierce warrior who shows absolutely no fear, no matter who the opponent is or how many opponents there are. She almost defeated Lady Death when they battled one on one. Her left hand has the ability to take the life essence out of anyone she touches with it and absorbs it for herself. She uses this ability to make herself stronger or to heal her when she's injured. This ability was acquired after she came into possession of the demonography and some of its power seeped into her hand. The flesh on her left hand was eaten away leaving only the skeleton, covered in flames. She wears an armored glove to protect it until she is ready to use it. The only way she can touch anyone with her left hand without hurting them is to leave the glove on. On her right hand she wears a single retractable blade which is at least a foot long. She uses it for hand-to-hand combat. She also has a retractable set of black wings with which she is able to fly. She can also use her wings as a weapon. In her battle with Lady Death, she was able to slice Lady Death across her stomach with one of her wings while in mid flight. Being an angel, she is also immortal and she is bred to be immune to all types of magic and spells. Weakness The only known weakness in War Angel seems to be psychological. Lady Death pointed out during their battle that anytime someone mentions the fact that God doesn't speak to her anymore, she loses focus and is prone to make mistakes.

It was issued in 1969 on the Apple label in Japan, West Germany and Italy. Although the album was scheduled to be released worldwide, the release in the US and UK at that time was halted without explanation. Many reasons for halting the album have been suggested by the band and Apple employees, but the most common theory is that Apple's newly hired president, Allen Klein, stopped all non-Beatle releases on Apple until he could examine the company's finances, which were in disarray at the time. A majority of the album's songs were later issued as Badfinger songs on the Badfinger album Magic Christian Music. History of Badfinger The Iveys (later known as Badfinger) were a successful live act on the London circuit when they attracted the attention of Apple employee Mal Evans in early 1968. It was through Evans' perseverance that demonstration recordings made by the group were presented to The Beatles (Apple's presidents). Although the band was initially waived by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, the former relented as more impressive Iveys tapes were brought in by Evans. The group signed with Apple in April 1968 and began making recordings immediately upon their arrival. With the incentive of releasing a worthwhile single, the band was not focused on compiling an LP. Maybe Tomorrow was therefore culled from various studio recordings the group made during a 12-month period, mostly under the production of Tony Visconti. The songs on the LP vary widely among pop, rock, and psychedelic sounds. With few exceptions, they do not resemble the sound Badfinger would later become known for. The sound quality of the Iveys album is relatively poor due to a \\"muddy\\" mix. When some of these tracks were carefully re-mixed for Badfinger's debut album Magic Christian Music the sound quality was significantly improved. The title track was released as an Apple single in 1968 and enjoyed limited success in regional markets‚Äîfor example, reaching number 1 in the Netherlands. Due to Badfinger's subsequent fame and the album's limited release, Maybe Tomorrow became an expensive collectible for many years, often earning between $200 and $400 US dollars for a single used copy. Although a 1990s re-release of the album on CD format curbed demand for the original album, the CD itself became collectible because of its limited run. For reasons unknown, the CD edition of \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\" has the stereo channels reversed and the song \\"Sali Bloo\\" (pronounced \\"Sally Blue\\") is missing the wah-wah guitar intro found on the original album. Track listing for The Iveys/Badfinger Songs marked '‚Ä†' also appear on Badfinger's first album, Magic Christian Music. *Produced and arranged by Tony Visconti, except: *+ Produced by Mal Evans, arranged by John Barham and Evans *++ Produced by The Iveys =Sleeve notes= On the sleeve Derek Taylor writes that these \\"four very nice kids [...] were not, nor are they now adventurous innovators, but they are ready, they are ready to be.

On December 14, 1930, she was awarded a Special Medal of Honor by the National Sculpture Society.  Biography  Adeline Valentine Pond was born in Boston. She began her art studies at the Massachusetts Normal Art School in 1880. She met Herbert Adams in Paris in 1887. She posed for a marble bust that was eventually exhibited at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. The couple married in 1889. Adams advocated for female sculptors including Laura Gardin Fraser, Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Janet Scudder, Bessie Porter Vonnoh, Abastenia St. Leger Eberle and Anna Hyatt Huntington. She also advocated for war memorials to be created by professional sculptors rather than mass-produced in factories. Adams's seven published texts include: \\"The spirit of American sculpture,\\" \\"Daniel Chester French, sculptor,\\" \\"Childe Hassam,\\" \\"John Quincy Adams Ward; An Appreciation,\\" \\"Sylvia,\\" \\"An Exhibition of American Sculpture,\\" and \\"Our medals and Our Medals\\".

In waveguide systems, as in the electric circuits, it is often desirable to be able to split the circuit power into two or more fractions. In a waveguide system, an element called a junction is used for power division. In a low frequency electrical network, it is possible to combine circuit elements in series or in parallel, thereby dividing the source power among several circuit components. In microwave circuits, a waveguide with three independent ports is called a TEE junction. The output of E-Plane Tee is 180¬∞ out of phase where the output of H-plane Tee is in phase.  E-Plane  For a linearly-polarized antenna, this is the plane containing the electric field vector (sometimes called the E aperture) and the direction of maximum radiation. The electric field or \\"E\\" plane determines the polarization or orientation of the radio wave. For a vertically polarized antenna, the E-plane usually coincides with the vertical/elevation plane. For a horizontally polarized antenna, the E-Plane usually coincides with the horizontal/azimuth plane. E- plane and H-plane should be 90 degrees apart.  H-plane  In the case of the same linearly polarized antenna, this is the plane containing the magnetic field vector (sometimes called the H aperture) and the direction of maximum radiation. The magnetizing field or \\"H\\" plane lies at a right angle to the \\"E\\" plane. For a vertically polarized antenna, the H-plane usually coincides with the horizontal/azimuth plane.

Social Security Death Index was an American entomologist, and a member of the Fairchild family, descendants of Thomas Fairchild of Stratford, Connecticut and one of two grandsons of the scientist and inventor, Alexander Graham Bell, for whom he was named, and son of David Fairchild, a botanist and plant explorer. Early life Alexander (\\"Sandy\\" to his friends and family) was born in 1906 in Washington, D.C. Like most entomologists, Fairchild began his lifelong love affair with insects by collecting butterflies in the fields and barns where he lived. At the age of 15, now an avid butterfly collector, young Fairchild was first introduced to the intensely fecund, immensely complex world of the American (\\"New World\\") tropical forests by his father, who was helping with starting the Barro Colorado Tropical Research Station in Panama. After a long canoe ride up the Chagres River in Panama, he became permanently hooked on the tropics. After a number of magical years travelling with his plant collector father to the jungles of Sri Lanka, Sumatra, and Indonesia, Sandy reluctantly finished high school at age 20, to then attend Harvard, graduating in 1931, in the depths of the Great Depression. Career With few to no jobs available, Sandy began working toward a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard. Encouraged by his faculty advisor, Professor Joseph Bequaert, Fairchild chose the Tabanidae, a family of insects known as \\"horse flies\\". Tabanids are worldwide, numerous, and taxonomically complex. Since some feed on humans and thus may carry diseases, Fairchild realized this specialty could get him a job in the tropics. Since he first fell in love with the tropics in Panama, he wrote his thesis, naturally, on the Tabanidae of Panama. After a year in Northwest Brazil, studying mosquitos with the Rockefeller Foundation he landed his dream job in Panama at the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory now known as the Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud. At 32, he moved to Panama with his bride Elva Russell Whitman of Boston, to there raise a family and research biting insects and ticks deemed threatening the thousands of Americans living at the time in the Panama Canal Zone. He eventually became Assistant, then Acting Director of that research facility in Tropical medicine, funded both by Congress and the Republic of Panam√°. He published his research on taxonomy and epidemiology, in over 130 scientific papers and books. In recognition of his 32 years of work on Panamanian insects, in 1978 the Universidad de Panam√° named their new Invertebrate Museum in his honor. After retiring, Sandy and his wife Elva (whom he married in 1938) moved to Gainesville, Florida, where for the next 25 years, he continued to publish papers and advise graduate students and fellow scientists around the world. In retirement and without pay, he organized the collections of Neotropical Tabanidae at the University of Florida and later at the Florida State Collection of Arthropods. Among the numerous honors he was given during his lifetime, he was proudest of having been named by the American Entomological Society as Entomologist of the Year. Sandy kept working happily in his chosen field until a week before he died‚Äîat the age of 87‚Äîon his last book. At last count, over 33 species of insects have been named after him by other entomologists.

This species of clover is native to most of Europe, excluding the Arctic zone, and western Asia, in plain or mid-mountain habitats up to altitude. It grows in dry sandy soils, both acidic and alkaline, soil with dry-mesic conditions and is typically found at the edge of fields, in wastelands, at the side of roads, on sand dunes, and opportunistically in vineyards and orchards when they are not irrigated. 240px Description Trifolium arvense is a small erect herbaceous annual or biennial plant, growing to 10‚Äì40 cm tall. Like all clovers, its leaves are trifoliate, divided into three slender, sessile leaflets 1‚Äì2 cm long and 3‚Äì5 mm broad, sometimes edged with small hairs and finely serrated. The leaves have a pair of stipules at the base, often tipped in red. The flowers are grouped in a dense inflorescence 2‚Äì3 cm long and 1-1.5 cm broad; each flower is 4‚Äì5 mm long, rosy white in colour, and especially characterised by the many silky white hairs which tip the five sepals, which are much larger than the petals. These hairs, along with the more or less oblong form of the inflorescence, are the inspiration for the common name. Pollination is carried out by bees, or via autogamy, since the plant is hermaphroditic, and the flowering season is from mid-spring to late summer. The fruit is a small pod containing a single seed. Distribution Trifolium arvense is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America where it now appears throughout the eastern United States, southern Canada, and the western part of the U.S. along the Pacific Coast. The plant has also been recorded in some parts of Hawaii. Reproduction Trifolium arvense flowers in early summer and does not require a cold period to induce flowering. Larger plants in good condition may flower for a longer period. In wild populations of Trifolium arvense only plants that are large enough (dry weight >0.01g) tend to produce seeds. The flowers of Trifolium arvense are self-fertilized, but visits by bees provide some opportunity for cross-fertilization. The seeds produced by Trifolium arvense are covered by a hard seed coat which enables them to survive for a long period without germinating unless the seed coat is damaged. Cultivation and uses Like most legumes, it fixes nitrogen, making it valued on low fertility soils for the benefit it gives to other crop species in supplying nitrogen. It is also grazed by sheep and goats. The nitrogen fixing ability of Trifolium arvensedepends on the size of nobule attach in the root system of legume. The sizes of nobule showing the positive correlation with the composition of community of microorganisms which are responsible for nitrogen fixing.Schulz, S., Engel, M., Fischer, D., Buegger, F., Elmer, M., Welzl, G., & Schloter, M. (2013). Diversity pattern of nitrogen fixing microbes in nodules of Trifolium arvense (L.) at different initial stages of ecosystem development. Biogeosciences, 10(2), 1183-1192. In semi-arid area, the percentage of nitrogen originate from the atmosphere in total amount of nitrogen fixation done by Trifolium arvense has been maintain in a high level range which refers to 82%-91%. In raining season, the total quantity of nitrogen been fixed by Trifolium arvense is larger than the one in dry season.Boswell, C. C., Lowther, W. L., & Rutherford, A. J. (2007). Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by Trifolium arvense in semi‚Äêarid short tussock grasslands. New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research, 50(4), 511-521. The medicinal value of Trifolium arvense has been discovered to treat both human and animals. It has been introduced to North America, where it is an invasive species in some areas. Trifolium arvenseis also regarded as food by some animals like rabbit, wild turkey, deer etc. However, due to the hairy flowers of Trifolium arvense, if horse or other livestock were feed by too much of them, abdominal obstruction may be caused suffering death. In addition, Trifolium arvense is also a kind of plant that has the characteristic of allergenicity. Although its mild as allergen, it needed to be pay attention. Scientists at AgResearch in New Zealand have used genetic modification to take a single gene from Trifolium arvense and put it into the more common white clover, Trifolium repens. The genetically modified clover could reduce bloating in livestock and decrease methane emissions. The release of the genetically modified clover is expected to be approximately 2025. Management Being part of Fabaceae, Trifolium arvense is managed similarly to other weeds in the family. Trifolium arvense can be easily controlled in small scale field like home garden by hand- pulling, cultivation or using mulch. But when it comes to farm or landscape of wide field, due to the seeds of Trifolium arvense are highly tolerant of extreme temperatureCaradus, J. R. (1995). Frost tolerance of Trifolium species. New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research, 38(2), 157-162. as well as physical damage because of their tiny size, long-term efforts of fighting against Trifolium arvense is required. Tillage and composting would not work well in this situation compared to other kind of weeds. Chemical application is needed to assist to remove Trifolium arvense. Once the weedy situation is under controlled, changing the cultural practice and turfgrass to avoid them to emerge again. In addition, increasing the amount of nitrogen and decreasing the amount of phosphorus contained in fertilizer used can be effective in removing family Fabaceae weeds and other weeds as well.

He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball from through , for the Washington Senators (1970‚Äì71), Texas Rangers (1972‚Äì76), Atlanta Braves (1977‚Äì80), Seattle Mariners (1981), Oakland Athletics (1982‚Äì84) and Toronto Blue Jays (1985). A two-time All-Star player, Burroughs was notable for being the American League RBI champion and being named the American League's Most Valuable Player that same year. He is the father of major league third baseman Sean Burroughs. In a 16-season career, Burroughs posted a .261 batting average with 240 home runs and 882 RBIs in 1689 games. Career Burroughs was selected by the Washington Senators with the first overall pick in the June 1969 draft. Late in the year, he joined the Senators at age of 19. Considered a \\"good bat-no field\\" kind of player, Burroughs was a considerable slugging threat during his playing days. Defensively, he was capable but slow. In four full seasons with the Texas Rangers, Burroughs averaged 25.5 home runs a year with a high of 30 homers in . His most productive season came in , when he batted .301 with 25 home runs and a league-leading and career-high 118 RBIs. He was voted the American League MVP, making him one of only seven overall number-one draft picks to win the MVP title (the others are Chipper Jones, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey, Jr., Bryce Harper, Joe Mauer and Josh Hamilton) and the first Ranger to win the award. During the 1974 season, Burroughs was at the center of the violent Ten Cent Beer Night debacle at Cleveland Stadium, where Burroughs was one of the targets of thrown objects and a few punches by unruly and inebriated Cleveland fans, in a game that was forfeited to Texas. Burroughs was selected an All- Star in both 1974 with the Rangers and 1978 as a member of the Atlanta Braves, when he entered the All-Star break with a National League-leading .324 batting average. Burroughs was also named AL Player of the Year and selected as an OF on the AL All-Star team by The Sporting News his MVP season of 1974. He was acquired by the Braves in a five-for-one trade that sent Ken Henderson, Dave May, Roger Moret, Adrian Devine, Carl Morton and $200,000 to the Rangers on December 9, 1976.Chass, Murray. \\"Braves Trade 5 Players For Rangers‚Äô Burroughs,\\" The New York Times, Friday, December 10, 1976. Retrieved May 1, 2020 As a member of the Braves, in , Burroughs collected 114 RBIs and hit 41 home runs, the latter number surpassed only by Cincinnati Reds outfielder George Foster (52). Burroughs had fans who maintained a large banner below the right field deck titled \\"Jeff's Jackpot\\", which displayed his home run total for the season plus one. Late in his career, Burroughs was still a valuable hitter, being used mainly as a DH and pinch hitter. Burroughs played his final year with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985 after being purchased by them. In 86 games, he had 49 hits and 19 runs with six home runs and 28 RBIs along with 36 strikeouts and 34 walks. He batted .257 with a .366 OBP. His final regular season game was on October 6, 1985, batting as a DH. He went 1-for-4 with two strikeouts in an 8-0 loss. He made his first and only appearance in a postseason game, having one at-bat in the ALCS that year, batting in Game 7 in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Kansas City Royals as a pinch hitter, which resulted in a ground out. After he retired, Burroughs later coached his son's Little League team, the Long Beach All-Stars; with Sean as their star player, these teams won the Little League World Series in both 1992 and 1993, winning the former by forfeit after their opponents (who had beaten them 15‚Äì4) were found to have used no fewer than 14 ineligible players and the latter 3‚Äì2 over Panama to be the first American team to repeat as champion and only the third city to ever do so after Monterrey, Mexico (1957, 1958) and Seoul, South Korea (1984, 1985).

History School photo, (boarder's matron in white, seated) The college was founded in 1938 at Mentone Beach, by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, or De La Salle Order of Brothers, also known as The French Christian Brothers. The Brothers built the college overlooking Mentone Beach which opened in February, 1938. The Order had purchased a property which included a Victorian homestead, \\"the McCristal Estate\\", that had been used by Mentone Girls Grammar School since the early 1920s. From its inception, St Bede's was a day and boarding school. It is now a day school only. It remains an independent school in the Catholic tradition with its administration still retained by the De La Salle Brothers. The founder of the institute, St Jean-Baptiste de la Salle, was a French nobleman of the 17th century, who in the reign of Louis XIV renounced his titles and estates, and founded free schools for the rural and urban poor, who had not previously been afforded the opportunity of an education. He was the founder of the classroom model of education and of teacher training colleges, and established schools staffed by consecrated laymen who donated their labour in return for their keep; living a life of primitive communism under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. These men became the Fratres Scholarum Christianarum (FSC), or De La Salle Brothers, as they came to be known in the English-speaking world. The school was named after St. Bede the Venerable, a 7th-century Benedictine monk and priest, who spent his life teaching and writing at Jarrow Abbey, and who was the first English historian, famous for his publication of Ecclesiastical History of the English People. St Bede's attracts Catholic students from Mentone and surrounding suburbs as far south-east as the Mornington Peninsula. As a boarding school its bailiwick was statewide and encompassed southern New South Wales, and internationally from South-East Asia, the South Pacific and the expat community. Its ethos is that of an essentially middle class institution, with an emphasis on athleticism, religion, and discipline. It now comprises approximately 1600 day students.  Technology  In 2016, the college's F1 in Schools team, Infinitude, set the World Record at the World Finals in Austin, Texas, in collaboration with Brighton Secondary School, Adelaide. Also in this same year, a team of students successfully won the Australian STEM Video Game Challenge in the Year 9-12 Gamemaker/Gamestar Mechanic category with their game Spectrum.  Principals  * Br.

It was originally developed by Hines Interests Limited Partnership in 1982. The mall was modeled after a similar Hines development, the Houston Galleria, which opened in 1970. Both malls have ice rinks and a glass vaulted ceiling that is modeled after the historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy. The mall features Banana Republic, The Western Galleria, Macy's, Pottery Barn, Nordstrom, American Girl, Gap, and Old Navy as its anchor stores. There are over 200 stores and restaurants, including an ice rink and the Westin Galleria Hotel. The property is owned by an investment consortium advised by UBS Realty Investors LLC, a subsidiary of UBS AG of Zurich, Switzerland, and is managed by Trademark Property Co. History In 1982, the mall, originally named Dallas Galleria, opened, with anchor stores Marshall Field's and Saks Fifth Avenue as well as the 432-room Westin. By 1985, the mall was expanded and a Macy's location was opened. On September 7, 1985, the mall was the location of WFAA-TV Channel 8's Sump'n Else bandstand program's 20th Anniversary live reunion special hosted by Ron Chapman and Ralph Baker Jr. with special appearances by \\"The Little Group\\" dancers and Kenny and the Kasuals, and was also simulcast live on KVIL. In November 1995, the mall underwent a expansion. In March 1996, Nordstrom opened as the anchor of the mall's new wing. In 1997, Marshall Field's sold all of its Texas locations, including the location at the mall. Saks Fifth Avenue purchased, renovated, and relocated its store to a new space in 1999, while the original Saks location at the mall was later converted into a Gap Inc. megastore housing Banana Republic on the first level, Gap on the second level, and Old Navy on the third level. In 2002, Hines Interests sold the mall to UBS Realty Investors LLC of Hartford, Connecticut, for $300 million. By 2003, a major renovation began and the mall's name was changed to \\"Galleria Dallas.\\" In April 2005, UBS Realty Investors LLC acquired the Westin Galleria Hotel, which is attached to the mall, from Hines Interests for $95 million. In April 2009, General Growth Properties, the management company of the mall, declared bankruptcy. In June, Simon Property Group obtained management rights effective August 1. In August 2011, a man committed suicide by jumping from the third floor of the mall, landing in the ice skating rink. On March 22, 2012, H&M; opened on the second floor across from Saks Fifth Avenue. On June 15, 2013, Saks Incorporated officially closed its Saks Fifth Avenue store in Dallas, which was soon renovated and replaced in 2014 by Belk. In April 2018, the AC Hotel and Residence Inn Dallas opened near the mall. In May 2018, Trademark Property Co. was hired to manage, lease, and replan the mall. On January 23, 2020, it was announced that Belk would be closing on March 21, 2020.https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2020/01/23/galleria-dallas-is- loosing-a-department-store-anchor/ On June 16, 2020 there was a shooting at the mall, where one person was injured.

Suevian peoples in red, and other Irminones in purple. The Dulgubnii are a Germanic tribe mentioned in Tacitus' Germania (Chapter 34) as living in what is today northwest Germany. Tacitus describes them being to the north of the Angrivarii and Chamavi, and as having moved from the north into the area once belonging to the Bructeri, between Ems, Lippe, and Weser. In this same area as the Dulgubnii, north of the Chamavi and Angrivarii, were the Chasuarii, and north of these, on the North Sea coast, where the Chauci. The Chasuarii's name is thought to derive from the River Hase which feeds into the middle of the Ems from the east, just northwest of the area associated with the Angrivarii, on the Weser. So from Tacitus, it appears that the Dulgubnii probably lived near the Weser. By the account of Tacitus, the Chauci in his time lived not only along the whole German coast, but would have also stretched down to the lands of the Cherusci and Chatti. So they were probably the neighbours of the Dulgubnii on the east. The Dulgubnii in Tacitus are probably the same as Ptolemy's Doulgoumnioi of the same region (Book 2, Chapter 10). (Many Germanic names are corrupted in Ptolemy's Greek.) Ptolemy describes them near the Elbe, so to the east of the position described by Tacitus, in an area Tacitus associated with the Chauci. They are described as having the \\"Laccobardi\\" (Langobardi) to their north, and the \\"Suebi Angili\\" (Angles) to their south. To their east are the Angrivarii, still near the Weser, and then the \\"Chamae\\" (Chamavi), between Ems and Weser, north of the Bructeri who are now on the Rhine. In Ptolemy, the Chamae, Angrivarii, and Laccobardi have the Chauci directly on their north, all the way to the coast, and stretched from Ems to Elbe. And the Dulgubnii are no longer between the Chauci and the Chamavi and Angrivarii. Compared to Tacitus, the Chasuarii had also moved away. Ptolemy mentions Casuari far to the south, east of the Abnoba mountains that run east of the Rhine (with the Tencteri apparently between Rhine and Abnoba at that point).

In the same theatre of the same war, Professor Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov and the Grand Duchess Yelena Pavlovna originated Russian traditions of recruiting and training military nurses ‚Äì associated especially with besieged Sevastopol (1854‚Äì1855). Following the war Nightingale fought to institute the employment of women nurses in British military hospitals, and by 1860 she had succeeded in establishing an Army Training School for military nurses at the Royal Victoria Military Hospital in Netley, Hampshire, England. QARANC - Our History In 1898, after the Spanish-American War, the United States added 1,500 nurses to their military personnel (Brooks, 2018). A year later in 1899, the Surgeon General recognized the importance of these nurses and established a \\"reserve group\\" of nurses with specific criteria to prepare for future wars. Military nurses are similar to floor nurses in that they spend most of their time providing direct patient care. Patient assessments, medication distribution, interventions and documentation are part of their daily work. These nurses are needed at all military bases, active war zones, clinics and front lines ‚Äì not always on United States territory.

For example, a branch known as the Air National Guard, allows an individual to join as enlisted and work as a Aeromedical Evacuation Technician while finishing their BSN degree. The military branch will pay for the individuals BSN and after graduation the nurse can earn a salary as a 2nd Lieutenant contingent upon successfully passing their nursing boards. Challenges to working as a military nurse Nurses can often experience challenges when delivering care to patients when they do not have the appropriate supplies, medicines, and equipment that is normally available in American hospitals A study was conducted in Camp Bastion Hospital in Afghanistan, where 18 British Armed Forces nurses were interviewed. These nurses serves in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014 and it was found that nurses often experienced many psychological stressors such as lacking family support, suffering from mental health issues, experiencing separation anxiety, missing their families and friends, feeling unprepared and not able to take care of seriously injured patients, and nurses found it emotionally difficult taking care of terminally ill patients.

It is the most important, the largest and holiest temple of Hindu religion in Bali, and one of a series of Balinese temples. Perched nearly 1000 meters up the side of Gunung Agung, it is an extensive complex of 23 separate but related temples with the largest and most important being Pura Penataran Agung. The temple is built on six levels, terraced up the slope. The entrance is marked by a candi bentar (split gateway), and beyond it the Kori Agung is the gateway to the second courtyard.Lonely Planet: Bali and Lombok, April 2009, p 215 History The precise origins of the temple are unclear but its importance as a holy site almost certainly dates from prehistoric times. The stone bases of Pura Penataran Agung and several other temples resemble megalithic stepped pyramids, which date back at least 2,000 years. It was certainly used as a Hindu place of worship from 1284 when the first Javanese conquerors settled in Bali. By the 15th century, Besakih had become a state temple of the powerful Gelgel dynasty. Location The temple is on the southern slopes of Mount Agung, the principal volcano of Bali. Architecture Meru towers of Pura Besakih Pura Besakih is a complex made up of twenty-three temples that sit on parallel ridges. It has stepped terraces and flights of stairs which ascend to a number of courtyards and brick gateways that in turn lead up to the main spire or Meru structure, which is called Pura Penataran Agung. All this is aligned along a single axis and designed to lead the spiritual person upward and closer to the mountain which is considered sacred. The main sanctuary of the complex is the Pura Penataran Agung. The symbolic center of the main sanctuary is the lotus throne, or padmasana, which is therefore the ritual focus of the entire complex. It dates to around the seventeenth century. A series of eruptions of Mount Agung in 1963, which killed approximately 1,700 people also threatened Pura Besakih. The lava flows missed the temple complex by mere meters. The saving of the temple is regarded by the Balinese people as miraculous, and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument the Balinese faithful had erected. Festivals Each year there are at least seventy festivals held at the complex, since almost every shrine celebrates a yearly anniversary. This cycle is based on the 210-day Balinese Pawukon calendar year. It had been nominated as a World Heritage Site as early as 1995, but was pulled out on 2015. Visitors In 2013, foreign visitors accounted for 84,368 persons (77.2 percent of all visitors), while domestic visitors accounted for 24,853 persons (22.8 percent).

In the UK, this field is more often termed angiology, and in the United States the term vascular medicine is more frequent. The field of vascular medicine (angiology) is the field that deals with preventing, diagnosing and treating vascular and blood vessel related diseases. Overview Arterial diseases include the aorta (aneurysms/dissection) and arteries supplying the legs, hands, kidneys, brain, intestines. It also covers arterial thrombosis and embolism; vasculitides; and vasospastic disorders. Naturally, it deals with preventing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Venous diseases include venous thrombosis, chronic venous insufficiency, and varicose veins. Lymphatic diseases include primary and secondary forms of lymphedema. It also involves modification of risk factors for vascular disease like high cholesterol, high blood pressure. Cardiovascular risk factors such high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and others fall under the specialty of vascular medicine. Hence, a vascular medicine specialist should be able to address most of the major diseases in our age in a comprehensive manner, using a unique perspective. Vascular medicine training In Europe, vascular medicine (angiology) training is well established in some European countries. The first European educational Working Group was born in 1991 in Milan (EWMA)becoming in 1998 a European Scientific Association VAS Vascular Independent Research and Education European Organization with several European educational programmes:European Felloship, European Master, CESMA-UEMS European Diploma and Postgrad Courses. In the United States there are several independent vascular medicine training programs and twelve NIH funded three-year programs as well. These programs are suitable for either Internal medicine specialists as a fellowship or for cardiologists. In 2005, the first vascular medicine boards were administered by the American Board of Vascular Medicine.

He studied oil painting under Asai Ch≈´ at the Sh≈çg≈çin Y≈çga Kenkyuj≈ç and Kansai Bijutsu-in (Kansai Fine Art Academy) together with Ryuzaburo Umehara. In 1907, at the age of nineteen he moved to Paris, France to study at the Acad√©mie Julianmyjapanesehanga.com under Jean-Paul Laurens.Benezit Dictionary of ArtistsGrove Art Online During this seven years, from 1907 to 1914, he was strongly influenced by the realistic styles of Jean- Fran√ßois Millet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and, in particular, Paul C√©zanne. Forced to return to Japan with the outbreak of World War I, in 1915, he made his debut at the Nikakai (Second Division Society) Exhibition, where he displayed forty-four paintings he had made in Paris. For the next ten years, Yasui suffered from recurring health problems and did not participate in exhibitions, while he attempted to perfect his style, which incorporates clear outlines and vibrant colors in portraits and landscapes, combining western realism with the softer touches of traditional nihonga techniques. In 1930, he displayed these techniques in \\"A Portrait of a Woman\\" to wide critical acclaim, and was nominated for membership in the prestigious Imperial Fine Arts Academy in 1935. From 1936, he cooperated with Ikuma Arishima to establish the Issui-kai, a rival organization to the Nikakai. In the postwar period, many of his works were selected as cover art for the literary magazine Bungeishunj≈´. From 1944, he was a professor at the Tokyo University of the Arts. In 1952, he received the Order of Culture from the Japanese government. He died in 1955 of acute pneumonia. His grave is at Shokaku temple in Kyoto.

Many of these items named after Euler include their own unique function, equation, formula, identity, number (single or sequence), or other mathematical entity. Many of these entities have been given simple and ambiguous names such as Euler's function, Euler's equation, and Euler's formula. Euler's work touched upon so many fields that he is often the earliest written reference on a given matter. In an effort to avoid naming everything after Euler, some discoveries and theorems are attributed to the first person to have proved them after Euler. Conjectures *Euler's conjecture (Waring's problem) *Euler's sum of powers conjecture Equations Usually, Euler's equation refers to one of (or a set of) differential equations (DEs). It is customary to classify them into ODEs and PDEs.

The term congophilic is sometimes used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after staining with Congo red. The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis. Signs and symptoms CAA is associated with brain hemorrhages, particularly microhemorrhages. Since CAA can be caused by the same amyloid protein that is associated with Alzheimer's dementia, brain bleeds are more common in people who have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, they can also occur in those who have no history of dementia. The bleeding within the brain is usually confined to a particular lobe and this is slightly different compared to brain bleeds which occur as a consequence of high blood pressure (hypertension) - a more common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke (or bleeding in the brain). Causes Astrocyte CAA has been identified as occurring either sporadically (generally in elderly populations) or in familial forms such as Flemish, Iowa, and Dutch types. In all cases, it is defined by the deposition of amyloid beta (AŒ≤) in the leptomeningal and cerebral vessel walls. CAA occurring in the Flemish type has been observed to be linked to large dense-core plaques observed in this pedigree. The reason for increased deposition of AŒ≤ in sporadic CAA is still unclear with both increased production of the peptide and abnormal clearance having been proposed as potential causes. Under normal physiology AŒ≤ is cleared from the brain by four pathways: (1) endocytosis by astrocytes and microglial cells, (2) enzymatic degradation by neprilysin or insulysin (3) cleared by way of the blood brain barrier or (4) drained along periarterial spaces. Abnormalities in each of these identified clearance pathways have been linked to CAA. In familial forms of CAA, the cause of AŒ≤ build up is likely due to increased production rather than poor clearance. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), Presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 genes can result in increased rates of cleavage of the APP into AŒ≤. An immune mechanism has also been proposed. apolipoprotein E (APOE) Œµ2 and Œµ4 are associated with increased risk of getting cerebral amyloid antipathy. The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of getting intracerebral haemorrhage in CAA. =Types= Several familial variants exist. The condition is usually associated with amyloid beta. However, there are types involving other amyloid peptides: * the \\"Icelandic type\\" is associated with Cystatin C amyloid (ACys). * the \\"British type\\" and \\"Danish type\\" are associated with British amyloid (ABri) and Danish amyloid (ADan) respectively. Both peptides are linked to mutations in ITM2B. * Familial amyloidosis-Finnish type is associated with gelsolin amyloid (AGel). Research is currently being conducted to determine if there is a link between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and ingestion of excessive quantities of aluminium. Pathophysiology The vascular amyloid pathology characteristic of CAA can be classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, the latter type being the more common. Type 1 CAA pathology entails detectable amyloid deposits within cortical capillaries as well as within the leptomeningeal and cortical arteries and arterioles. In type 2 CAA pathology, amyloid deposits are present in leptomeningeal and cortical arteries and arterioles, but not in capillaries. Deposits in veins or venules are possible in either type but are far less prevalent. Diagnosis MRI showing low signal foci in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Conventional gradient echo T2*-weighted image (left, TE=20ms), susceptibility weighted image (SWI) and SWI phase image (center and right, respectively, TE=40ms) at 1.5 Tesla. CAA can only be definitively diagnosed by a post-mortem autopsy. Biopsies can play a role in diagnosing probable cases. When no tissue is available for biopsy, the Boston Criteria are used to determine probable CAA cases from MRI or CT scan data. The Boston Criteria require evidence of multiple lobar or cortical hemorrhages to label a patient as probably having CAA. Susceptibility weighted imaging has been proposed as a tool for identifying CAA-related microhemorrhages. =Imaging= Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can be presented with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage or microbleeds in the brain. The bleeding usually occurs on the surfaces of the brain in contrast with intracranial haemorrhage due to high blood pressure which occurs deep locations of the brain such as basal ganglia and pons. In lobar intracerebral bleed, computed tomography (CT) scan would show hyperdense haemorrhage area and hypodense odema around the haemorrhagic site. MRI sequence of gradient echo and Susceptibility weighted imaging(SWI) are useful in detecting microbleeds and deposition of iron on the brain cortex (cortical superficial siderosis). Other MRI indicators of CAA include white matter hyperintensities and cortical thinning. Management The aim in cerebral amyloid angiopathy is to treat the symptoms, as there is no current cure. Physical, occupational and/or speech therapy may be helpful in the management of this condition. History Gustav Oppenheim was the first to report vascular amyloid Œ≤ deposits on the vasculature of the central nervous system in 1909. The first paper focusing solely on what would come to be known as CAA was published in 1938 by WZ Scholz. In 1979, H. Okazaki published a paper implicating CAA in certain cases of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. The Boston Criteria for CAA originated in a 1995 paper from Harvard Medical School.

Illustrated by Wilhelm Ferdinand Souchon in 1872 Imogen (also spelled Innogen) is the daughter of King Cymbeline in Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. She was described by William Hazlitt as \\"perhaps the most tender and the most artless\\" of all Shakespeare's women.Who's Who in Shakespeare By Peter Quennell, Hamish Johnson, p. 107 Name According to some modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, notably the 1986 Oxford Edition, the correct name is in fact Innogen, and the spelling \\"Imogen\\" is an error which arose when the manuscripts were first committed to print. The name Innogen is mentioned as a ghost character in early editions of Much Ado About Nothing as the wife of the Leonato character. Imogen in Cymbeline is paired with a character with the epithet \\"Leonatus\\". Actions in the play Imogen by Herbert Gustave Schmalz Imogen is princess of Britain, and the virtuous wife of the exiled Posthumus, whose praise of her moral purity incites Posthumus's acquaintance Iachimo to bet Posthumus that he can seduce her. When he fails, Iachimo hides in her bedchamber and uncovers her body while she sleeps, observing details of a mole on her breast which he then describes to Posthumus as proof that he had slept with her. Posthumus plots to kill his wife, but the designated killer reveals the plot to Imogen and advises her to hide; she escapes to the woods dressed as a man and falls in with a family who help her. Taking a drug, she falls into a coma and is presumed dead by the family, who cover her body and sing a song over her. When she wakes she finds the headless body of Cloten, a brutish character who had planned to rape her while wearing Posthumus's clothes, but had been killed in a fight with one of the men who took her in. She mistakes the headless body for that of her husband. After the battle at the climax of the play she confronts Iachimo who confesses his lies. She is reunited with Posthumus, and her father (King Cymbeline), and discovers two of the men who took her in are actually her long lost brothers. Literary allusions Oscar Wilde alludes to Imogen in The Picture of Dorian Gray when Dorian describes Sibyl Vane, the actress he is infatuated with. 'It must be, if you say it. And now I am off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about tomorrow. Good- bye.'(Ch. IV) Stephen Dedalus alludes to Imogen in Ulysses, referring to the episode in which Iachomo observes the mole on her breast: \\"Ravisher and ravished, what he would, but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted.\\" E. M. Forster alludes to Imogen in Where Angels Fear to Tread when describing Lilia's sadness in her marriage: \\"Not Cordelia nor Imogen more deserves our tears.\\" A character in Anthony Trollope's Barchester Towers mentions Imogen: \\"Imogen was true, but how was she rewarded? Her lord believed her to be the paramour of the first he who came near her in his absence.\\" John Keats, a great admirer of Shakespeare, in a famous letter to Richard Woodhouse, contrasts Imogen to one of Shakespeare's most notoriously immoral characters, Iago, in order to describe the character of the poet: \\"The poetical character has no self‚Äîit is everything and nothing‚Äîit has no character and enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated‚Äîit has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet... A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence because he has no identity, he is continually filling some other body.\\" Imogen is also alluded to in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story \\"The Antique Ring\\": \\"Or, who knows, but it is the very ring which Posthumus received from Imogen?\\" In George Bernard Shaw's rewrite of the last act of Cymbeline, Cymbeline Refinished, Imogen becomes a much more assertive figure in line with Shaw's feminist views. She continually questions both Iachimo and Postumus at the end, refusing to forgive them before finally saying that she will \\"go home and make the best of it, as other women must\\".Bernard F.

The lateral three bays on each side are recessed and have two storeys; the rest of the building is single-storied. The central seven bays form a recessed entrance behind six unfluted Ionic columns. Elsewhere the bays are divided by pilasters. The windows are sash windows. Along the top of the building is a cornice. Inside is a central hall, a lecture theatre, a library, a museum, and meeting rooms, all lit from above by glazed domes. Present day The Institution \\"exists to foster an environment for furthering medical and health education and knowledge\\". It organises lectures and social events, runs a library, and hosts meetings of the Liverpool Medical History Society, which was founded in 1984. It is a registered charity, and hosts the Mersey branches of the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of General Practitioners of Great Britain. The Institution also contains an historic library, available to members and researchers, which includes an archive of rare medical books and manuscripts from the 16th century. A portrait of Dr Richard Caton hangs in the Institution, who founded the forerunner to the Liverpool Medical Students Society, known as The Liverpool Royal Infirmary School of Medicine Debating Society (M.S.D.S.) in 1874.

She founded the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1935, she immigrated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she maintained a practice. Deutsch was one of the first psychoanalysts to specialize in women. She was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Early life and education  Helene Deutsch was born in Przemy≈õl, then in the Polish Partition of Austrian Galicia, to Jewish parents, Wilhelm and Regina Rosenbach, on 9 October 1884. She was the youngest of four children, with sisters, Malvina, and Gizela and a brother, Emil.Appignanesi/Forrester, p.308 Although Deutsch's father had a German education, Helene (Rosenbach) attended private Polish-language schools. In the late eighteenth century, Poland had been partitioned by Russia, Prussia, and Austria; Helene grew up in a time of resurgent Polish nationalism and artistic creativity, Mloda Polska. As a result, Helene empathized with the works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and Polish literature, insisting on her Polish national identity, out of allegiance to a country that she and her siblings viewed as invaded. During her youth, Helene became involved in the defence of socialist ideals with Herman Lieberman, a Polish politician. Their relations lasted for more than ten years. She went with him to an International Socialist Conference in 1910 and met the majority of key socialist figures, such as the charismatic women Angelica Balabanoff and Rosa Luxemburg.Tr√©hel, G. (2010) Deutsch studied medicine and psychiatry in Vienna and Munich. She became a pupil and then assistant to Freud, and became the first woman to concern herself with the psychology of women. Following a youthful affair with the socialist leader Herman Lieberman, Helene married Dr. Felix Deutsch in 1912, and after a number of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, Martin. In 1935, she fled Germany, immigrating to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States. Helene Deutsch's husband and son joined her a year later, and she worked there as a well-regarded psychoanalyst up until her death in Cambridge in 1982. Family =Father= Helene often reported that her father was her early source of inspiration. Her father, Wilhelm, was a prominent Jewish lawyer, 'a liberal and a specialist in international law' during a time when anti- Semitism was rampant. He was able to become Galicia's representative at the Federal Court in Vienna, and the first Jew in the region to represent clients in court. Similar to Freud, Wilhelm saw clients in a special room in his home, but he also had a formal office away from home. Helene idolized her father, and often shadowed him throughout his day with clients.Appignanesi/Forrester, p.309 Being able to shadow her father led Helene to contemplate at one-time becoming a lawyer, until she learned that women were excluded from practicing law. This exclusion led her to psychology, which would become her lifelong career. Known in Przemy≈õl as the beautiful Rosenbach daughter, Helene was given the title of most 'brilliant enough to be a son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene turned to her father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education past the age of fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect of feminine masochism with her attachment to her father and the possible consequences of such an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home. =Mother= Helene Deutsch's relationship with her mother was distant and cold. While she generally adored her father, Helene hated her mother, Regina. According to Helene, her mother, 'shared none of her husband's intellectual interests,' and Helene considered her mother's aspirations to be social and materialistic. Helene claimed her mother was abusive, often beating, slapping, and verbally attacking her. Helene argued that her mother was abusive, not to punish her, but 'as an outlet for her own pent-up aggressions' because Helene was not the boy her mother had wanted and expected. Helene often said that her childhood home was dominated by her mother's overwhelming concern for social propriety and status. Helene considered her mother 'uncultured, intellectually insecure, and a slave to bourgeois propriety'. Although Helene at times yearned for the love of her mother, she never really received any maternal love from her mother. Instead, any maternal presence came from her sister, Malvina, and a woman in the neighborhood affectionately called 'the Pale Countess.' During her childhood, Helene remembered being 'mothered by nine different nurses,' and hated feeling dependent on her [mother]. These feelings often led her to 'daydream that someone else was her real mother.' =Siblings= Helene Deutsch's sister, Malvina, was the person from whom she received maternal affection. When their mother decided to beat Helene, Malvina was the one to caution beatings away from the head. Malvina, however, was herself the subject of the limited view of a woman's role in society. Helene Deutsch and her sisters were expected to marry early in life and to marry socially appropriate men. Although a gifted sculptor and painter, Malvina was forced to marry the man chosen by her parents as 'more appropriate,' instead of the man of her dreams. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 310 Helene's brother Emil, however, offered abuse rather than affection. Emil sexually abused Helene when she was around four years old, and continued to torment her throughout her childhood. In her later life, Helene saw this affair as the 'root cause of her tendency not only secretly to fantasize, but to relay these fantasies as truth.' As the only son in the family, Emil was supposed to be the heir apparent to the family. Instead, Emil proved to be a gambler, profiteer and poor student, and a disappointment to the family. Throughout her life, Helene tried to make up for her brother's shortcomings, but 'felt she never successfully made up for Emil's failure in her mother's eyes,' but did replace him as her father's favorite. The \\"as-if\\" personality 'Her best known clinical concept was that of the \\"as if\\" personality, a notion that allowed her to spotlight the origin of women's particular ability to identify with others'.Paul Roazen \\"Deutsch-Rosenbach, Helene Deutsch singled out schizoid personalities who 'seem normal enough because they have succeeded in substituting \\"pseudo contacts\\" of manifold kinds for a real feeling contact with other people; they behave \\"as if\\" they had feeling relations with other people ... their ungenuine pseudo emotions'.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 445 and p. 532 More broadly, she considered that 'the \\"generally frigid\\" person who more or less avoids emotions altogether ... may learn to hide their insufficiencies and to behave \\"as if\\" they had real feelings and contact with people'.Fenichel, p. 477 It has been suggested that it was 'Helene's tendency to love by identifying herself with the object, then experiencing that love as betrayed and running to the next object ... [that] she herself explored in her various studies on the \\"as if\\" personality'.Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, Freud's Women (London 2005) p. 322 Indeed, Lisa Appignanesi has written that 'her memoir sometimes fills one with the sense that she experienced her own existence to be an \\"as if\\" ‚Äî living her life first \\"as if\\" a socialist in her identification with Lieberman; \\"as if\\" a conventional wife with Felix; \\"as if\\" a mother ... then \\"as if\\" a psychoanalyst in the identification with Freud'.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 322 On women 'Helene Deutsch, who was to make her name with her writings on female sexuality'Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time 9London 19880 p. 463 became paradoxically something of an Aunt Sally 'in feminist circles ... her name tarnished with the brush of a \\"misogynist\\" Freud whose servile disciple she is purported to be'.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 307-8 In 1925 she 'became the first psychoanalyst to publish a book on the psychology of women'; and according to Paul Roazen, the 'interest she and Karen Horney showed in this subject prompted Freud, who did not like to be left behind, to write a number of articles on women himself'.Roazen In his 1931 article on \\"Female Sexuality\\", Freud wrote approvingly of 'Helene Deutsch's latest paper, on feminine masochism and its relation to frigidity (1930), in which she also recognises the girl's phallic activity and the intensity of her attachment to her mother'.Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 390 In 1944‚Äì5, Deutsch published her two-volume work, The Psychology of Women, on the 'psychological development of the female ... Volume 1 deals with girlhood, puberty, and adolescence. Volume 2 deals with motherhood in a variety of aspects, including adoptive mothers, unmarried mothers, and stepmothers'.Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (Penguin 1976) p. 134 Mainstream opinion saw the first volume as 'a very sensitive book by an experienced psychoanalyst .. Volume II, Motherhood, is equally valuable'.Eric Berne, Sex in Human Loving (Penguin 1970) p. 230 It was, however, arguably 'Deutsch's eulogy of motherhood which made her so popular ... in the \\"back-to-the-home\\" 1950s and unleashed the feminist backlash against her in the next decades' ‚Äî though she was also seen by the feminists as 'the reactionary apologist of female masochism, echoing a catechism which would make of woman a failed man, a devalued and penis-envying servant of the species'.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 327 and p. 308 As time permits a more nuanced, post-feminist view of Freud, feminism and Deutsch, so too one can appreciate that her central book 'is replete with sensitive insight into the problems women confront at all stages of their lives'. Indeed, it has been claimed of Deutsch that 'the ruling concerns of her life bear a striking resemblance to those of women who participated in the second great wave of feminism in the 1970s: early rebellion ... struggle for independence and education ... conflict between the demands of career and family, ambivalence over motherhood, split between sexual and maternal feminine identities'.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 307 In the same way, one may see that 'to cap the parallel, Deutsch's psychoanalytic preoccupations were with the key moments of female sexuality: menstruation, defloration, intercourse, pregnancy, infertility, childbirth, lactation, the mother-child relation, menopause ... the underlying agenda of any contemporary women's magazine ‚Äì an agenda which her writings helped in some measure to create'. On pregnancy In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the outbreak of World War I, Helene experienced the first of many miscarriages.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 315 In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene tells the story of a woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 316 The story of Mrs. Smith is strikingly similar to that of Helene's, as if she, herself, were speaking through Mrs. Smith. Through the story of Mrs. Smith, Helene argues that a successful pregnancy is possible when there is a loving relationship between mother and daughter, which 'smoothly socializes daughters into becoming mothers themselves.' Mirroring the life of Helene, Mrs. Smith's problem is resolved during the next pregnancy when Mrs. Smith identifies with a pregnant friend, and particularly with the friend's mother. Helene wrote that the friend's mother was the opposite of Mrs. Smith's mother. She was filled with maternal warmth for both Mrs. Smith and her own daughter. This maternal love, shared with her friend, allowed Mrs. Smith to become a mother. According to Helene, although a healthy relationship between mother and daughter was important for a healthy pregnancy, equally important was the ability to lean on a female friend who could act as a surrogate sister for the pregnant woman. This idea is furthered when Mrs. Smith and her friend became pregnant again around the same time. This time, there was no anxiety or fear surrounding pregnancy, but when Mrs. Smith's friend moved away, she miscarried. The diagnosis, according to Helene, was that Mrs. Smith suffered from 'over-excitability of the uterus.' A successful pregnancy, therefore, could only be brought about by leaning on another woman. Freud and beyond In 1916, Helene sought admittance to Freud's infamous Wednesday night meetings of Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. As a condition of her acceptance, Helene had to comment on Lou Andreas-Salom√©'s paper, 'Vaginal and anal.' In 1919, under Freud's supervision, Helene began analyzing her first patient, Viktor Tausk, while at the same time Freud was analyzing Helene. After three months, upon Freud's request, Helene terminated Tausk's sessions. During her sessions with Freud, Helene reported 'falling in love with Freud.' She often felt herself to be Freud's daughter, claiming that Freud had inspired and released her talents. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 318 Helene claimed, however, that Freud tended to focus \\"too much on her identification with her father\\" and her affair with Lieberman. In one analysis with Freud, Helene dreamt that she had both female and male organs. Through analysis with Freud, she discovered that her personality was largely determined by her \\"childhood wish to be simultaneously [her] father's prettiest daughter and cleverest son.\\" Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 319 After one year, Freud terminated Helene's analytic sessions, to instead work with the Wolf Man. Helene nevertheless was a brilliant clinician, who stood up to Freud and got away with it when she 'disagreed with him about her patients.' Following Karl Abraham's presentation on femininity, penis envy and the feminine castration complex at the Hague Congress in 1920, Helene left analysis with Freud to work with Abraham. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 320 While at the Hague Congress, Helene presented her paper on The Psychology of Mistrust. In it, she claimed that lying was a defense against real events, as well as an act of creativity. In 1923, Helene moved to Berlin without her husband, Felix, or her son, Martin, to work with Abraham, who she felt probed more deeply than Freud. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 321 Helene felt relaxed while working with Abraham and enjoyed his 'cool analytic style and his objective insight without any reeling experience of transference.' While in session with Helene, Abraham showed her a letter from Freud addressed to him. In it, Freud argued that the topic of Helene's marriage with Felix should remain off the table during analysis. It was only later that Abraham confessed that he was unable to analyze her because he \\"had too much feeling for her.\\" It is hypothesized that Freud, in abruptly terminating Helene's analysis and by sending the letter to Abraham, was trying to break Helene's compulsion to repeat. In 1924, Helene returned to Austria from Berlin. She also returned to Felix and Freud. Her continued relationship with Freud was friendly, yet at times strained. Following Freud's death, however, Helene often referred to herself as Freud's ghost. The following year, in 1925, Helene published The Psychoanalysis of Women's Sexual Functions. In it, she diverged from Freudian logic. She argued that, in the phallic stage, the little girl's primary erogenous zone is the \\"masculine clitoris,\\" which is inferior in entirety to the male penis. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 325 It is this awareness of the inferiority of the clitoris, wrote Helene, that forces the little girl to grow passive, inward and turn away from her 'active sexuality'. That same year, Helene created and became the first President of the Vienna Training Institute. Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 323 In 1935, Helene emigrated with her family from Vienna to Boston, Massachusetts, where she continued to work as a psychoanalyst until her death in 1982. On technique 'In a 1926 paper ... ‚Äî a paper which Freud later cited ‚Äì she emphasizes that intuition, the analyst's ability to identify with the patient's transference fantasies, is a potent therapeutic tool', proving herself thereby a forerunner to much later work on the analyst's ' free-floating responsiveness ... as a crucial element in his \\"useful\\" countertransference'.Joseph Sandler, in Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 165 Deutsch was wary accordingly of any 'rigid adherence to the phantom of \\"Freudian Method\\", which, as I now realize, I must regard as an area of research ' and not as 'a complete, learnable entity which can be taught by thorough and regular drilling'.Deutsch, in Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 324 She herself however was 'one of the most successful teachers in the history of psychoanalysis ... her seminars were remarkable experiences for students, and her classes were remembered as spectacles'. Deutsch was a very esteemed and beloved training analyst and supervisor, whose seminars, based on case studies, were known to often run into the early morning hours.  1950 to death  After 1950, Helene Deutsch began to say that she regretted being known primarily for her work with women's psychology. At this time, Deutsch began to turn her attention back to men's psychology and narcissism in both sexes. Over time, she became increasingly devoted to the study of egoism and narcissism, thereby abandoning her lifelong study of feminism. In 1963, Deutsch retired as a training analyst in part due to her husband, Felix's, declining health and memory loss.Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 328 In 1963, Felix Deutsch died. Following his death, Helene Deutsch began to reminisce about her life with Felix and all that he had given her. Her relationship with Felix, up to that point, had always been a little bit strained. Through numerous affairs, like the one she had with S√°ndor Rado, Deutsch had always felt that Felix was more of the mother figure than she. According to Deutsch, \\"Felix seemed to have no trouble in 'naturally' displaying all the motherly ease. Even in situations in which a child usually calls for his mother, [Martin] turned more often to Felix than to me.\\"Appignanesi/Forrester, p. 317 Following Felix's death in 1963, Helene Deutsch turned her attention toward the sexual liberation of the 1960s and Beatlemania. She argued that these two events were due to fathers \\"taking a back-seat in childrearing\\". This absence of fathers then led to loneliness in children, who then sought solace with their peers. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975. On 29 March 1982, Helene Deutsch died at the age of 97. In her last days of life, she remembered the \\"three men closest to her, combining Lieberman, Freud and her father into one man\\". In her autobiography Deutsch wrote that during the three main upheavals in her life: her freedom from her mother; \\"the revelation of socialism\\"; and her time with psychoanalysis, she was inspired and aided by either her father, Lieberman or Freud.

Brogues were traditionally considered to be outdoor or country footwear not otherwise appropriate for casual or business occasions, but brogues are now considered appropriate in most contexts. Brogues are most commonly found in one of four toe cap styles (full or \\"wingtip\\", semi-, quarter and longwing) and four closure styles (Oxford, Derby, ghillie, and monk). Today, in addition to their typical form of sturdy leather shoes or boots, brogues may also take the form of business dress shoes, sneakers, high-heeled women's shoes, or any other shoe form that utilises or evokes the multi-piece construction and perforated, serrated piece edges characteristic of brogues. History Modern brogues trace their roots to a rudimentary shoe originating in Ireland and Scotland that was constructed using untanned hide. Modern brogues feature decorative perforations. These are often said to stem from the original Irish brogues as well, specifically from holes intended to allow water to drain from the shoes when the wearer crossed wet terrain such as a bog. However, contemporary descriptions of the original brogues do not mention such holes. The word \\"brogue\\" came into English in the late sixteenth century. It comes from the Gaelic br√≥g (Irish), br√≤g (Scottish) \\"shoe\\", from the Old Norse \\"br√≥k\\" meaning \\"leg covering\\". The Scots word brogue is also used to denote a bradawl or boring tool as well as the action of piercing with such a tool. The word \\"brogue\\" was first used to describe a form of outdoor, country walking shoe in the early twentieth century traditionally worn by men. At that time the brogue was not considered to be appropriate for other occasions, social or business. Over time perceptions have changed and brogues are now considered appropriate in most contexts, including business. Brogues continue to be most common as leather dress and casual shoes and boots, but can also be found in many other forms including canvas and leather sneakers and high-heeled women's shoes. Styles Brogues are most commonly found in one of four toe-cap styles (full or \\"wingtip\\" brogues, semi-brogues, quarter brogues and longwing brogues) and four closure styles (Oxford, Derby, ghillie and monk strap). Most commonly offered as a leather dress shoe, brogues may also come in the form of boots, canvas or leather sneakers or any other shoe type that includes or evokes the multi-piece construction and perforated, serrated edges characteristic of brogues. =Toe caps= Brogue styles are determined by the shape of the toe cap and include the commonly available full brogue (or \\"wingtip\\" in the United States), semi-brogue and quarter brogue styles, and may also be found in the less common longwing brogue style. Full brogues (or wingtips) Men's full brogue (or wingtip) Oxford dress shoe spectator dress shoes Full brogues (also known as wingtips) are characterised by a pointed toe cap with extensions (wings) that run along both sides of the toe, terminating near the ball of the foot. Viewed from the top, this toe cap style is \\"W\\" shaped and looks similar to a bird with extended wings, explaining the style name \\"wingtips\\" that is commonly used in the United States. The toe cap of a full brogue is both perforated and serrated along its edges and includes additional decorative perforations in the center of the toe cap. A shoe with a wingtip- style toecap but no perforations is known as an \\"austerity brogue\\", while a plain-toe shoe with wingtip-style perforations is a \\"blind brogue\\". Spectator shoes (British English: Co-respondent shoes) are full brogue Oxfords constructed from two contrasting colours, typically having the toe and heel cap and sometimes the lace panels in a darker color than the main body of the shoe. Common color combinations include a white shoe body with either black or tan caps, but other colours can be used. Ghillie brogues Men's full brogue ghillie shoes The ghillie style of full brogue has no tongue, to facilitate drying, and long laces that wrap around the leg above the ankle and tie below the calf to facilitate keeping the tie clear of mud. Despite the functional aspects of their design, ghillie brogues are most commonly seen as a component of traditional, formal Scottish dress and are worn primarily for social occasions. Semi-brogues (or half brogues) Toe cap detail of a man's semi-brogue (or half brogue) dress shoe Semi-brogues (also known as half brogues) are characterised by a toe cap with decorative perforations and serration along the cap's edge and includes additional decorative perforations in the center of the toe cap. The half brogue was first designed and produced by John Lobb Ltd. as an Oxford in 1937 in an effort to offer his customers a shoe more stylish than a plain oxford, yet not as bold as a full brogue. Quarter brogues Men's quarter brogue Oxford dress shoes Quarter brogues are characterised by a cap toe with decorative perforations and serrations along the cap's edge, however, unlike semi-brogues, quarter brogues have no decorative perforations in the center of the toe cap. Quarter brogues are more formal than semi brogues and full brogues; they are the most formal of dress shoes with brogueing, making them the ideal fit to pair with business attire (suits). Longwing brogues Longwing brogues (also known in the US as \\"English\\" brogues, and in the UK as \\"American\\" brogues) are Derby style shoes characterised by a pointed toe cap with wings that extend the full length of the shoe, meeting at a center seam at the heel. Longwing Derby brogues were most popular in the US during the 1970s, and although the popularity of this style has decreased, it remains available. =Closures= Closure style is not a defining characteristic of the brogue and therefore brogues can be found in a variety of closure styles. Brogues are commonly available in laced Oxford, Derby or ghillie styles, but can also be found as buckle and monk strap shoes and slip-on shoes with or without elastic closures.

Falan was founded before 1539, by the Guandecas and Pompon√°es tribes. It was discovered by Spanish Baltazar Maldonado in 1539. The population of the municipality was 17,251 as of the 1993 census. The total area of the municipality is 238 km¬≤. Most workers work in agriculture although some do logging or mining. The altitude is 930 meters above sea level. Falan was originally inhabited only by indigenous inhabitants. In the middle of the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors first came across Falan. Spanish settlers came in the mid 18th century, seeking to extract silver and gold from the nearby mines, they called the community Rosario de Lajas. A nearby mine that much ore was brought out of was named Santa Ana, and soon the community began to be called by that name. In 1930, the municipality changed its name once again to Falan, in honor of the poet Diego Fall√≥n Carri√≥n who had been born in the region. The local economy of Falan, produces coffee, cacao, yucca, maize, panelera cane, banana, and fruits. In addition, wood is harvested throughout the municipality.

He is best known now for his etchings, and as the inventor of the printmaking technique of monotyping. He was known as Il Grechetto in Italy and in France as Le Ben√©dette. Biography An Architectural Capriccio with a Bacchanalian Procession by Filippo Gagliardi and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione Castiglione was born in Genoa. His early training is unclear. He may have studied with Sinibaldo Scorza. Wittkower describes him as a \\"passionate student\\" of Anthony van Dyck, who arrived in 1621, and Peter Paul Rubens, who stayed in the city in the first decade of the 17th century and whose paintings were readily accessible there. He may have trained under the Genoese Bernardo Strozzi. He lived in Rome from 1634 to about 1645, then returned to Genoa. He also traveled to Florence and Naples. He was back in Rome in 1647, before moving in 1651 to be a court artist in Mantua for Duke Carlo II and his wife Isabella Chiara de Austria. He died in Mantua. He had various brushes with the law in his lifetime. The Queen's Gallery in London, where an exhibition of his work was held in 2013, made the following statement: \\"Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione was also a violent and impetuous man, who was repeatedly in court for assault, allegedly attempted to throw his sister off a roof and was forced to leave Rome, probably after committing murder. The turbulence that characterised his life overshadowed his artistic brilliance, and Castiglione struggled to achieve recognition in his lifetime. Much of what is known about the artist is derived not from fulfilled commissions, but from court documents.\\"Furness, Hannah The Daily Telegraph 4 September 2013 Artistic achievements Christ Chasing the Moneylenders from the Temple He painted portraits, historical pieces and landscapes, but chiefly excelled in fairs, markets and rural scenes with animals. Noah's ark and the animals entering the Ark was a favorite subject of his. Castiglione was a brilliant draftsman and pioneered the development of the oil sketch (often using a mixture of mediums) as a finished work - previously they had been used only for working studies for another finished piece, for example by Rubens. He returned to the same subjects over and over again, but with significantly different compositions each time. Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Adoration of the Shepherds He also executed a number of etchings (see cover of edition of The genius of Castiglione published in 1648). Diogenes searching for a Man is one of the principal of these; others are about religious themes. Some are moralistic stories such as that of the blind leading the blind. The etchings are remarkable for light and shade, and have even earned for Castiglione the name of a second Rembrandt. He was exposed to Rembrandt's etching by 1630. In about 1648 he invented the monotype, the only printmaking technique to be an Italian invention, making over twenty over the succeeding years. His most popular and influential prints were a series of exotic heads, mostly of vaguely Oriental males, but also of women. These were produced in great numbers. Among the topics of his etchings are Diogenes with his lantern, Noah leading animals into Arc, St Joseph Asleep during Flight from Egypt, Circe surrounded by animals, Silenus at the fountain, Nativity, Resurrection of Lazarus, and Genius of Castiglione. Castiglione was renowned for his ability to paint animals, mostly barn animals, and this was often a dominant motif in his paintings. For example, in the painting of Jesus clearing the temple of Moneylenders, the religious event is a minor, background part of the painting, the stampede of animals is far more prominent than the scattering of bankers. Castiglione's attention to detail in the depiction of nature is regarded as proof of the influence of Scorza and the Flemish still life and animal painter Jan Roos who was a long-term resident of Genoa.Timothy J. Standring. \\"Castiglione.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 March 2016 It has been suggested that it was Jan Roos who convinced Castiglione to enliven his religious and mythological compositions with animal and still life elements.Carl Velde, Flemish Art in Hungary: Budapest, 12‚Äì13 May 2000, Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgie voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 2004, p. 55-58 In Mantua, he received his name of Grechetto, from the classic air of his pastoral depictions. In his later years, he was severely afflicted by gout. His brother Salvatore and his son Francesco excelled in the same subjects; and it is thought that many paintings which are ascribed to Benedetto are only copies after him, or perhaps originals by his son or brother. He also influenced Anton Maria Vassallo (c1640-60). Among those who engraved after him were Giovanni Lorenzo Bertolotto in Genoa,Dizionario geografico-storico-statistico-commerciale degli stati del Re di Sardegna, Volume 7, by Goffredo Casalis, Turin (1840), page 724. the Venetian Anton Maria Zanetti, Michele l'Asne, Louis de Chatillon, and Coreneille Coemans. His paintings are to be found in Rome, Venice, Naples, Florence, and more especially Genoa and Mantua. The Presepio (Nativity of Jesus) for the church of San Luca, Genoa, ranks among his most celebrated paintings, and the Louvre contains eight characteristic examples. He painted a SS. Mary Magdalene and Catharine for the church of the Madonna di Castello and St. James defeats the Moors for the Oratorio di San Giacomo della Marina, both in Genoa.

Mission The US Army Veterinary Corps' mission is to protect the Warfighter and support the National Military Strategy. They accomplish this by providing veterinary public health capabilities through veterinary medical and surgical care, food safety and defense, and biomedical research and development. In addition, Veterinary Corps Officers provide military veterinary expertise in response to natural disasters and other emergencies. While the current mission statement does not include the performance of stability and reconstruction operations, Veterinary Corps personnel are involved in these missions.Smith, J.C.

Filled with sensuality and erotic imagery, the song was described by Isaak as a declaration to \\"somebody who is so evil and twisted and bad, and yet, you still want them‚Äù. The title evokes how \\"That‚Äôs a bad bad thing\\" is used by both parents scolding misbehaving children and adults during sexual intercourse. Similar to how Isaak's \\"Wicked Game\\" only became a success following its inclusion in Wild at Heart (1990), the song got most of its mainstream recognition after being featured in the 1999 Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Kubrick heard the song as Kidman listened to Isaak's music to liven up during rehearsals. Isaak was asked for his approval as he prepared to perform on The Tonight Show, and immediately agreed once he was told it was for Kubrick, who Isaak declared \\"hasn't done a film I didn't like\\". The singer said he always considered \\"Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing\\" ripe for soundtracks due to being \\"kind of a strange piece of work, with a really driving beat and a manic energy that I thought would probably work well for some visuals\\". David Kahne remixed the track for the Eyes Wide Shut trailers and television spots, and the redone version was released as a radio single on June 22, 1999. Isaak has approved of the remix, feeling it was \\"more rocking and everything sounds louder\\".

The MC traces its earliest origins to the first physicians recruited by the Medical Department of the Army, created by the Second Continental Congress in 1775. The US Congress made official the designation \\"Medical Corps\\" in 1908, although the term had long been in use informally among the Medical Department's regular physicians. Currently, the MC consists of over 4,400 active duty physicians representing all the specialties and subspecialties of civilian medicine. They may be assigned to fixed military medical facilities, to deployable combat units or to military medical research and development duties. They are considered fully deployable soldiers. The Chief of the Medical Corps Branch (under the Army's Human Resources Command) is a colonel and the senior-most Medical Corps officer in the Army is the U.S. Army Surgeon General, a lieutenant general. History =Origins= Both the Army Medical Department and the Medical Corps trace their origins to 27 July 1775, when the Continental Congress established the first Army Hospital to be headed by a \\"Director General and Chief Physician\\". The language of the Congressional resolution spoke of ‚Äúan Hospital‚Äù which in those days meant a hospital system or medical department. Among the accomplishments of Army surgeons during the years of the Revolution was completion (in 1778, at Lititz, Pennsylvania) of the first pharmacopoeia printed in America. In 1789, the Department of the Hospital was disbanded and a system of \\"Regimental Surgeons\\" was established in its place. =19th century= The horseman in the foreground is an infantry surgeon in the uniform adopted in January 1812. During the period that followed (1789‚Äì1818) Congress provided for a medical organization for the Army only in time of war or emergency. For example, in 1812 Congress established the Medical Department of the Northern Army as a response to the need for medical support during operations in the War of 1812. In 1816, medical officers were given uniforms (but not military rank) for the first time. A permanent and continuous Medical Department was not established until 1818. That year a ‚ÄúSurgeon General‚Äù was appointed (Dr. Joseph Lovell, the first to hold that specific title) and since then a succession of Surgeons General and a permanent Corps organization in the Army Medical Department have followed. Physicians assigned to the U.S. Army were finally accorded military rank in 1847, although the old Regimental Surgeon system of additional designations (\\"Assistant Surgeon\\", \\"Surgeon\\") was also retained until 1908. In 1862, Surgeon General William Alexander Hammond proposed establishment of an \\"Army Medical School\\" in which medical cadets and others seeking admission to the MC could receive such post-graduate instruction as would better fit them for military commissions. It was over 30 years, however, before Surgeon General George M. Sternberg would found (1893) the Army Medical School (AMS), the precursor institution to today‚Äôs Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. =20th century= Congress made official the designation \\"Medical Corps\\" in 1908, although the term had long been in use informally among the Medical Department's regular physicians. The Army Medical School was housed in the Army Medical Museum and Library building in Washington, DC, between 1893 and 1910. World War I brought a realization of the need to provide more than the ‚Äúfinishing school‚Äù approach of the AMS to military medical education and indoctrination and in 1920, the Medical Department first established hospital internships as a method of acquiring new officers for the MC. Meanwhile, part of the role of the AMS (which would become part of the Army Medical Center in 1923) was taken over by the new Medical Field Service School which opened at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania in 1921. Its purpose was to train both new medical officers and newly enlisted medics in the practice of field medicine. (This school was transferred to Texas in 1946, became the Academy of Health Sciences in 1973, and became the AMEDD Center & School in 1991). The first woman to receive a Regular Army commission in the MC was Major Margaret D. Craighill in 1943. She was assigned as Chief Surgeon to the Women‚Äôs Army Corps. In 1946, Army residency programs for MC officers were introduced into the Medical Department, providing for the first time the full spectrum of graduate medical education (GME) to prospective MC officers. In 1954, a prominent thoracic surgeon and Harvard graduate, Frank Berry, was appointed as the second Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Upon assuming office one of his first acts was to propose a plan for young military physicians to follow one of three pathways after completing their internship: #Enter the armed services immediately and return to their residencies after fulfilling their obligated service; #Enter the armed services two years after medical school and complete their residencies after service; #Enter the service after the completion of residency training. The ‚ÄúBerry Plan‚ÄùOfficially, the Armed Forces Physicians' Appointment And Residency Consideration Program deferred doctors who were taking their residency, so that the Army would get the benefit of their advanced education. Eventually, GME became both a recruiting and a retention tool for the AMEDD, and board- certified specialists were attracted in steady numbers. Those MC officers who did not elect Option 1, or who were not needed immediately, were ‚Äúdeferred.‚Äù Some were allowed Option 3, to complete their residency training and then entered active duty as a fully trained specialist. Those who were deferred for only one year of residency were termed ‚Äúpartially trained specialists‚Äù and were usually given military assignments that allowed them to work within their specialty. Many residency programs would give a year‚Äôs credit toward completion of residency for their time in military service to physicians who served under Option 2. (This triple option program continued for 19 years until the US military draft ended in 1973.) During the Vietnam era, serious physician shortfalls were experienced by the Defense Department and it was at this time (1966) that osteopathic physicians, who had previously been excluded from active military service, were first admitted to the MC. To avoid reinstating another ‚Äúdoctor draft‚Äù, the US Congress took steps to encourage medical students to enter the military as physicians. Completing this trend, medical school training has been provided for military students since the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) was established in 1972, graduating its first class in 1980. USUHS is the United States' center for military medical education. Its primary mission is to prepare its graduates for service in the medical corps of all the uniformed services of the country. Eventually, USUHS graduates made up about 25% of all doctors in the military. (Now it graduates about 164 physicians each year; around 90% of all USUHS graduates remain on active duty until reaching retirement eligibility.) By the mid-1990s, the strength of the Army's MC had risen to about 5,400 active duty officers, but cutbacks soon ensued. =21st century= As of mid-2008, the number of active duty doctors serving in the MC nearly met the requirement of 4,448 authorized positions. Primary care specialties represented the greatest shortfall in endstrength numbers.Medical Operational Data System (MODS), \\"AMEDD Deployment Data\\"; Available from http://www.mods.army.mil/ Career management As with all Army officers, the military occupational specialty (MOS) classification system provides the MC officer with his/her officer branch, area of concentration (AOC), branch skill code (degree of proficiency), special qualifications identifiers (SQIs), additional skill identifiers (ASIs), language identification, and reporting classifications.Headquarters, Department of the Army, Department of the Army Pamphlet 611‚Äì2, ‚ÄúMilitary Occupational Classification and Structure‚Äù ; Washington, DC (31 March 1999). The MC is one of the Special Branches of the Army, and thus is not classified as a Basic Branch. Special Branches are a grouping of branches and officers primarily concerned with providing combat service support and/or administration to the Army as a whole, but managed separately from USAHRC combat service support branches. (Other Special Branches are the Army Chaplains and the Judge Advocate General.) =Entry= The most common source of new physicians for the Army are medical students attending civilian medical schools and participating in the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP). By so participating they have their expenses paid for them and incur a 4-year service obligation. A smaller number graduate from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) in Bethesda, Maryland and serve on active duty (as second lieutenants) while students, incurring a seven-year obligation. Some MC officers are accessed via direct commission after completion of specialty or sub-specialty training before entry on active duty. =US Army MC specialties= The MC consists of 41 areas of concentration (AOC) within officer branches 60, 61 and 62. A young MC officer typically starts out as a general medical officer (GMO) ‚Äî AOC 62B, essentially qualified as a general practitioner ‚Äî following completion of the first year of graduate medical education (GME).Malish, Richard Glade (2009), The United States Army Battalion Surgeon: Frontline Requirement or Relic of a Bygone Era?

They may later specialize following completion of residency training in a military (or less often, civilian) program. Later, these physicians may continue with subspecialty training or continue in operational positions providing clinical care, conducting research, or in other positions.Department of the Army Pamphlet 600‚Äì4, ‚ÄúArmy Medical Department Officer Development and Career Management‚Äù Washington, DC (27 June 2007), pg 45.

The 1902 adoption of this ancient symbol of the Greek god Hermes for U.S. Army medical officer uniforms popularized it throughout the world. The branch skill codes (\\"degree of proficiency\\" designators) for the US Army MC are:DA PAM 600‚Äì4, 27 June 2007, pg 47. *Medical proficiency 9A‚ÄîDetermination is on a basis of individual merit by TSG‚Äôs Classification Board. *Medical proficiency 9B -- Certification by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in a particular specialty or subspecialty. *Medical proficiency 9C -- Completion of formal subspecialty training to meet the ABMS requirement of an approved residency or fellowship in a recognized teaching center. *Medical proficiency 9D -- Successful completion of the first year (internship) of an approved GME training program. *Medical proficiency 9E -- Intern in an approved first year GME training program which, upon successful completion, will result in the Medical Proficiency of 9D. While an intern, the officer will be awarded the AOC specialty in which he/she is training with the medical proficiency skill identifier of 9E. *Medical proficiency 9F -- Fellow in an approved fellowship GME training program. The branch skill code is appended to the MC officer‚Äôs AOC. For example, ‚Äú60H9C‚Äù designates a board-eligible, but not yet board-certified, Army cardiologist. =Licensures, boards, credentials, and special pays= All Army MC officers are required to hold a state medical license in at least one U.S. state and to fulfill all requirements necessary for maintaining it. (No federal physician holds a ‚Äúfederal medical license‚Äù to practice.) Younger MC officers are typically not boarded as they have not yet taken specialty training, but as they advance in their careers, board-certification becomes a virtual necessity for promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher. The Army's Surgeon General maintains a Central Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS) in which practitioner credentials files are monitored and validated at the local medical treatment facility (MTF) level. In addition to the basic pay and allowances available to all officers, a continuation pay program and a variety of bonuses and entitlements under the Officer Special Pay Program keep Army physician pay competitive with civilian practitioners and allow for voluntary physician retention in the active force. The continuation pay program is tied directly to the maintenance of a state license and a board-certification bonus encourages MC officers to maintain active board certification by taking a re- certification exam every 10 years. Specialty pays incentivize the various specialties and sub-specialties with sliding rates and a variety of contracts (generally 2, 3, or 4 years) are available after any basic educational obligation has been fulfilled. =Career assignment fields= U.S. Army physicians serve in one of three general career fields that are not formal parts of the MOS classification system: Operational Medicine is the field of Army medicine that provides medical support to the Soldier and his/her Chain of Command. Many Operational Physicians serve as Division, Brigade and Battalion level Surgeons (the word \\"surgeon\\" is used to identify a physician that is assigned to a unit as a primary care provider and not necessarily as a General Surgeon). These Physicians are either assigned through the PROFIS (Professional Filler System) or through permanent assignment (PCS). Deployments with units to combat theaters are for the duration of a deployment and the jobs are mostly filled by primary care physicians. A PROFIS provider can expect to be deployed away from their family for a total of 16 months (1 month before deployment, 12 months in theater, and 3 months for \\"stabilization\\" after return to the assigned units home station). This means that primary care physicians are deployed for longer periods than most specialist Physicians. A specialist (ie..General Surgeon, Trauma Surgeon, Rheumatologist) will usually be deployed for 6 months. Operational Physicians should expect that greater than 60% of their time will be spent in administrative roles and non-patient care. 40% of the Operational providers time is spent caring for Soldiers or supervising unit Physician Assistants(PAs). With the recent BCT (Brigade Combat Team) restructuring, the demand for Operational Surgeons have increased. Likely, the poor retention of Captains and junior Major Physicians in the primary care fields is due to the relative inequality of deployment length and deployment frequency. Clinical Medicine is the field of Army medicine where a Physician in uniform basically functions like a Physician in the Civilian arena. These Physicians are assigned to the various Army MEDCENs (Medical Centers) and MEDDACs (Medical Department Activities, i.e., hospitals and clinics). Each of these Physicians are assigned to a PROFIS unit. Usually primary care physicians deploy to fill Battalion level Surgeon positions. Medical Specialists deploy to support CSH (combat support hospitals). Research Medicine is filled by the minority of military physicians. Most of these research Physicians are based in larger Army Medical Centers.History, Training, and Education (AMEDD website), \\"AMEDD FAQ and General Info\\"; Available from www.amedd.army.mil/ See also * U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) * United States Army Medical Department Museum * United States Navy Medical Corps * United States Air Force Medical Corps References =Citations and notes= =Other sources= *Engleman, Rose C. and Robert T.

The earliest known publication was from London in 1792, presenting it as a traditional song from Sicily; but no original source or date has been confirmed for the simple melody or the poetic text. The tune is often called \\"'Sicilian Mariners Hymn\\" or similar titles, referring to the seafarers' nightly invocation of Mary as their maternal protector: The editor identified the article's author in his obituary: Our Lady, Star of the Sea. The tune has been notably reused for the German Christmas carol \\"O du fr√∂hliche\\" (O, how joyful), the English recessional hymn \\"Lord, Dismiss Us With Thy Blessing\\", and the first half of the American civil rights anthem \\"We Shall Overcome\\". Similar Latin lyrics have been set to entirely different tunes since the 1500s, by notable composers and arrangers including Leonhard Kleber (probably editing another composer), Louis-Nicolas Cl√©rambault, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, and Fritz Kreisler (using a melody of Arcangelo Corelli). Latin lyric and English translation Below is a common version of the text; many other versions exist. {  style=\\"padding-left:1em;\\"O most holy, o most loving, sweet Virgin Mary! Beloved Mother, undefiled, pray, pray for us. You are solace and refuge, Virgin Mother Mary. Whatever we wish, we hope it through you; pray, pray for us. Look, we are weak and deeply deplorable; save us, o Mary! Take away our lassitude, heal our pains; pray, pray for us. Virgin, look at us, Mother, care for us; hear us, o Mary! You bring divine medicine; pray, pray for us. } The first lines of the Latin text are similar to the final line of the 12th-century prayer Salve Regina: \\"O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria.\\" An 1820 book claims, without verification, that these words were already engraved at Speyer Cathedral at the time of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090‚Äì1153). A 1612 book also associates the saint and the cathedral with these words, without claiming they were already engraved there during his lifetime. Widening circulation Earliest known printing: European Magazine, November 1792 \\"O sanctissima\\" was published as \\"The Prayer of the Sicilian Mariners\\", with text and music for voice and harp, in Edward Jones's Miscellaneous Collection of French and Italian Ariettas. His undated publication is sometimes estimated as 1785,. . but his cited position as Bard to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales did not begin until \\"about 1790\\". The hymn was published anonymously by European Magazine in 1792 and then by an American magazine in 1794. By the early 1800s, \\"O sanctissima\\" was spreading widely in multiple languages. J.G. Herder included the song posthumously in his prominent book of traditional folksongs (', 1807), while Haydn (Hob. XXIIIc:F2) and Beethoven (WoO 157:4) each wrote choral arrangements of the Latin hymn. A German-language version (\\"O du fr√∂hliche\\", c.1816) became a well-known Christmas carol, with original lyrics by J.D. Falk referring not to the Blessed Virgin Mary, but rather to Jesus himself and his day of birth. In English: O, how joyfully; O, how merrily Christmas comes with its grace divine. Grace again is beaming; Christ the world redeeming. Hail, ye Christians, hail the joyous Christmas time! Or, in another English-language rendition: O thou happy, O thou holy, Glorious peace bringing Christmas time. Angel throngs to meet thee; on Thy birth we greet Thee: Hail to Christ, the Son of God, our newborn king! In the 20th century, a group of textual variants commonly known as \\"O Thou Joyful\\" became popular in the United States. Although most of these texts are anonymous, one has been attributed to William Glass. By 1835, the tune (with its first half repeated) also came to be used for the English recessional hymn \\"Lord, Dismiss Us With Thy Blessing\\", and by 1945 it appears to have influenced the melody of the American civil rights anthem \\"We Shall Overcome\\", with a close match between the chantlike first half of both tunes.

The highest Iranian summit is Mount Quchan (Kuh-e Quchan) with .Kopet-Dag Range, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, www.britannica.com Etymology The word k√∂pet originates from the Turkmen language where \\"k√∂p\\" means \\"a lot\\" or \\"many\\" and the word \\"dag\\" means \\"mountain\\" or \\"peak\\". So, K√∂petdag translates from Turkmen as \\"Many mountains (peaks)\\". In Persian koppeh means \\"pile\\" or \\"heap\\", and the word dag or dagh means \\"mountain\\" in Turkic. So, the Persian version of Kopet Dagh or Koppeh Dagh could be defined as \\"the mountain that is piled or heaped\\" and therefore the words could mean \\"piled or hilly mountains\\" or \\"low hills\\" in general. Geology Geologically, the Kopet Dag Range is made chiefly of Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks with a smaller portion of Jurassic rocks in the southeastern parts.Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.irGeological Map of the Middle East, published by Geological Survey of Iran, Second Edition, 1993 The mountains were formed in the Miocene and the Pliocene during the Alpine orogeny. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Turan Platform. This collision folded the entire rocks that had been deposited in this geosyncline or basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene and formed the Kopet Dag Mountains. Topography The Kopet Dag Range is a region characterized by foothills, dry and sandy slopes, mountain plateaus, and steep ravines. The Kopet Dag is undergoing tectonic transformation, and is subject to severe earthquakes. Earthquakes exceeding seven on the Richter scale have been recorded.Oct. 5, 1948 - More than 110,000 people were killed by 7.3 quake.

S≈Çownik biobibliograficzny, pod red. Jadwigi Czachowskiej i Alicji Sza≈Çagan. Warszawa 1996. Tom 4. , s. 363 but her date of birth is contested between 20 May 1935 and 20 May 1937. She was four years old, living in Lublin, when the World War II began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland. Krall lost most of her close relatives in the Holocaust. She survived deportations to death camps only because she was hidden from the Germans by the Polish rescuers. =Journalism= After Krall finished her studies in journalism, she started working for the Polish local paper ≈ªycie Warszawy (\\"Warsaw Life\\") in 1955. In 1966 she left the paper and began to write for the well known magazine Polityka (\\"Politics\\"). Shortly after, Wojciech Jaruzelski, then Prime Minister of the former People's Republic of Poland, declared martial law, Krall left Polityka and wrote articles for the Gazeta Wyborcza some time later. =Books= During Krall's time working for Polityka, she published her first book named Na wsch√≥d od Arbatu (\\"Heading east from Arbat\\") in 1972, written after she spent several years as a correspondent in Moscow. The book depicted day-to-day life in Moscow during the 1960s. Commercial success came with the publication of ZdƒÖ≈ºyƒá przed Panem Bogiem (engl. title: Shielding the Flame). The book is about a Polish Jewish cardiologist and social activist, Marek Edelman, who was one of the founders of ≈ªydowska Organizacja Bojowa (Jewish Combat Organization) and who took over its leadership after the head-commander Mordechai Anielewicz had perished. 'Shielding the Flame can be seen as a model for most of Krall's works. Krall describes the relations between Jews, Poles and Germans during the Holocaust and the years thereafter. Her most recent success Kr√≥l kier zn√≥w na wylocie (\\"Chasing the King of Hearts\\") has been translated into 17 languages an earned many awards since its publication in 2006, including the German W√ºrth Preis for European Literature 2012 and the Found in Translation Award 2014. Pawel Huelle, Hanna Krall and Dorota Nowak discussion at the Literaturomania in Gda≈Ñsk, 2009 Apart from the central Holocaust theme, Krall's writings also reflect her search for her own identity, as can be seen very clearly in Dowody na istnienie (\\"Evidence for Existence\\"). Another theme in this book is the often complicated destiny of the Polish people in history and the influence of the past on people's lives in the present. Krall was a friend of Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, and inspired Decalogue Number 8 in the series of films made by these two men.

He was one of the first to realize the value of fenced as against open runs, and spent over ¬£200,000 in fencing and providing water. He later owned Momba Station, one of the largest sheep stations in outback New South Wales. Waite and other pastoralists in the area formed the Pastoralists' Association of West Darling in 1906. On 21 November 1864 Waite married his first cousin Matilda Methuen (d.1922), a daughter of James Methuen of Leith, Scotland. Together they had eight children. For many years he lived in the country and kept a strict eye on the management of his various properties. Later he was able to hand over much of this management to his son, while he conducted business in Adelaide. He thoroughly understood the needs of pastoralists, and in 1883 became chairman of Elder's Wool & Produce Co. Ltd, a subsidiary Elder Smith and Company. In 1888 the two companies were amalgamated and he became chairman of directors of Elder Smith & Co. Ltd, \\"displaying remarkable ingenuity and initiative\\". He held this position for 34 years, resigning a few months before his death. Waite was also Managing Director of the Beltana Pastoral Co. Ltd and the Mutooroo Pastoral Co. Ltd. He held directorships with the Commercial Union Assurance Co. Ltd, the British Broken Hill Co. Ltd, and the S.A. Woollen Co. Ltd. Philanthropic deeds Urrbrae House, which was included in Peter Waite's bequest to the University of Adelaide. The house was his primary place of residence from 1891 when it was completed until his death in 1922. In 1913 Waite presented to the University of Adelaide his valuable Urrbrae estate comprising and house, to which in 1915 was added the adjoining Claremont and Netherby estates of . Benefactions to the University of Adelaide allowed the university to establish the Waite Agricultural Research Institute which later became the Waite Campus of the university, the hub of the Waite Research Precinct. The Waite Institute was established on the site in 1924. The donation remains one of the largest public benefactions in South Australian history. The objective of the bequest was to advance the cause of education, and more especially, to promote the teaching and study of agriculture, forestry and other related subjects. The Waite Institute has developed into an integrated research and teaching precinct that has been presented as a model for the collocation of agricultural research institutions. Waite also gave an adjoining estate of to the government of South Australia for the purpose of founding an agricultural high school: Urrbrae Agricultural High School. Waite was working until a few months before his death from heart failure on 4 April 1922; he was survived by his wife, son and three daughters. One of his daughters, Elizabeth Macmeikan (died 5 April 1931), left the residue of her estate, some ¬£16,000, to the University of Adelaide to be used for the study of sciences relating to the land, either in connexion with the Waite Research Institute or otherwise.

It was produced by DIC Entertainment, L.P. and distributed by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment under the CBS/Fox Video label. The film follows two friends in middle school who travel through time, meeting Dr. King at several points during his life. It featured an all-star voice cast and was nominated for an Emmy award in 1999 for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming More Than One Hour). It was also the final release under the CBS/Fox Video name before it was retired. It was released three days before Martin Luther King Jr.'s 70th birthday. Plot Miles Woodman, a black teenager who is a sports fan of baseball icon Hank Aaron, is failing at school. His teacher Mrs. Clark threatens to have him repeat 6th grade if his grades do not improve. Miles and his class visit a museum dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr. He and his white best friend Randy explore Martin's bedroom but are caught by the museum's curator Mrs. Peck, who winds up an old watch. The boys hold Martin's baseball glove and are transported back to 1941, encountering a 12-year-old Martin playing with his two white friends until their mother arrives and reprimands her sons for integrating with \\"coloured\\". Martin explains to Miles and Randy that her hatred of black people is that she regards them as \\"different\\", but violence would only worsen things. The boys travel 3 years forward and meet a teenage Martin on a segregated train, who explains that blacks and whites are unable to integrate and must be kept separate at all times. They later have dinner with Martin's family. While he goes to do shut in rounds with his father, the boys travel 11 years forward and meet Martin in his 20s working as a minister at a church. He is holding a meeting about the Montgomery bus boycott set off after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus and was imprisoned for it; now, black people are refusing to ride buses. Martin is alerted that his house has been bombed; he races home where his wife and newborn daughter have escaped unharmed. His friend Turner announces they'll attack the perpetrators with weapons in retaliation, but Martin stops him, reminding the crowd of Gandhi peacefully standing his ground to exile the British colonies from India and of Jesus teaching love for his enemies. Miles and Randy travel to the Birmingham riot of 1963, witnessing firemen and police officers squirting black protesters with hoses and releasing German Shepherds on them. The boys are transported back to the museum and rejoin their class at school the next day. Miles and Randy tell Miss Clark about the events prior to Martin's work. The class watches a VHS tape of Martin's work. After school, the boys' classmates, Latina girl Maria and another Caucasian boy Kyle, decide to investigate for themselves of how Miles and Randy got the information. When the boys arrive at the museum, Mrs. Peck lets them stay but warns them that when one messes with the past, this can affect the present. Maria and Kyle follow and catch them in Martin's bedroom. The four are transported to the March on Washington Movement and meet Martin in his 30s along with a young Mrs. Clark. When they return, they discover Martin was assassinated. They travel back to 1941 and bring 12-year-old Martin to the present. However, only Miles and Martin return together and the present is different. The museum is burnt down; Randy and Kyle are racists and no longer friends with Miles or know him; their middle school is segregated and named after Robert E. Lee; the principal is also racist and mistreats Mrs. Clark; Maria works as a maid and can't speak English; Miles and his mother live in poverty as she also works as a maid. The next day, Martin summarizes because he left his own time, it created an alternate timeline where his civil rights work never happened. Miles and Martin bid one another a farewell, and as Martin leaves, he gives Miles his watch. Martin returns to his time, where he is shot dead at his hotel and the timeline returns to normal. Miles reunites with Randy, Maria and Kyle. Mrs. Peck knows about his time traveling and tells him that while they cannot change the past, they can change the future for the better. Miles receives an A on his history test, allowing him to progress to 7th grade. He and his friends then vow to continue Martin's work. Mrs. Peck closes the door to Martin's bedroom.

A few of the major characters in the film (notably \\"Greenbaum\\" and \\"Duncan\\") are fictional, or composite characters. It was filmed in various locations in Canada, but mainly in Halifax, Nova Scotia and at Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Distributed in both official languages English and French, the two episodes first aired 31 March and 1 April 2002. As background research, writer Wayne Grigsby spoke to numerous people who had known Trudeau, but the Trudeau family did not reply to requests by the CBC. A prequel, Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making, came out in 2005, examining Trudeau's early life. This $8-million, four-hour CBC production was originally designed as a \\"double shoot,\\" to be filmed in both French and English versions; however, it ended up being made in English only ‚Äì even though most of the actors, including lead St√©phane Demers, are Qu√©b√©cois.

Accuracy In several interviews at the time of the premiere, actual Trudeau PMO bureaucrats commented on the general accuracy of the film; even Trudeau himself said, \\"'That,' Pierre Elliott Trudeau pronounced, 'is a very good film.'\\" However, there is one major exception. Most characters in the film refer to Trudeau as \\"Mr. Prime Minister.\\" This is improper Canadian government protocol; the prime minister is simply referred to as \\"Prime Minister\\", although it is not uncommon for the Prime Minister to be addressed by the former as well as the latter. It is notable that actor R. H. Thomson refused to use the scripted address and ad-libbed instead.

The practice of armoring horses was first extensively developed in antiquity in the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Pahlava, and after the conquests of Alexander the Great it made its way into European military practices via the Seleucid Empire and later Byzantine Empire. Though its historical roots lie in antiquity in the regions of what was once the Persian Empire, barded horses have become a symbol of the late European Middle Ages chivalry and the era of knights. During the Late Middle Ages as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was exploited by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn in the 14th century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the English at the Battle of Cr√©cy in the same century where longbowmen shot horses and the then dismounted French knights were killed by heavy infantry. Barding developed as a response to such events. Examples of armour for horses could be found as far back as classical antiquity. Cataphracts, with scale armour for both rider and horse, are believed by many historians to have influenced the later European knights, via contact with the Byzantine Empire.Nell, Grant S.

Surviving period examples of barding are rare; however, complete sets are on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art,Horse Armor of Duke Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg at the Philadelphia Museum of Art the Wallace Collection in London, the Royal Armouries in Leeds, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Horse armour could be made in whole or in part of cuir bouilli (hardened leather), but surviving examples of this are especially rare.Phyrr et al., 57-59 Chanfron A chanfron made in Italy in the early 16th century The chanfron (also spelled chaffron, champion, chamfron, chamfrein, champron, and shaffron) was designed to protect the horse's face. Sometimes this included hinged cheek plates. A decorative feature common to many chanfrons is a rondel with a small spike.Broughton, p. 100 The chanfron was known as early as ancient Greece, but vanished from use in Europe until the twelfth century when metal plates replaced boiled leather as protection for war horses. The basic design of the chanfron remained stable until it became obsolete in the seventeenth century, although late examples are often notable for engraved decoration. A chanfron extended from the horse's ears to its muzzle. Flanges often covered the eyes. In an open chanfron, the eyes received no protection. Hinged extensions to cover the jowls were commonly used for jousting tournaments.Mondadore, pp. 417 - 418. The enigmatic Torrs pony-cap from Scotland appears to be a bronze chanfron from about the 2nd century BC, perhaps later fitted with the bronze horns found with it. Criniere A set of armour with a criniere (protecting neck), peytral (protecting chest) and the croupiere (protecting hind quarters). Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. The criniere (also known as manefaire or crinet) was a set of segmented plates that protected the horse's neck. In full barding this consisted of two combinations of articulated lames that pivoted on loose rivets. One set of lames covered the mane and the other covered the neck. These connected to the peytral and the chanfron.Mondadore, p. 143. Light barding used only the upper lames. Three straps held the crinet in place around the neck. It is thought that thin metal was used for these plates, perhaps 0.8 mm. Mail armour was often affixed to the crinet and wrapped about the horse's neck for additional protection. Croupiere The croupiere (also crupiere bacul or crupper) protected the horse's hind quarters. It could be made from any combination of leather, mail, or plate armour. Flanchard Peytral with decorative openings, early 16th century, Germany The flanchards, used to protect the flank, attached to the side of the saddle, then around the front or rear of the horse and back to the saddle again. These appear to have been metal plates riveted to leather or in some cases cuir bouilli armour (which is boiled or treated leather sealed with beeswax or the like). They sometimes had openings designed to allow the rider to use spurs. Peytral The peytral was designed to protect the chest of the horse, while the croupiere protected the rear. It sometimes stretched as far back as the saddle. Caparisons tournament shows fully caparisoned horses Barding was often used in conjunction with cloth covers known as caparisons. These coverings sometimes covered the entire horse from nose to tail and extended to the ground. It is unclear from period illustrations how much metal defensive covering was used in conjunction. Textile covers may also be called barding. Other features Another commonly included feature of barding was protection for the reins, so they could not be cut. This could be metal plates riveted to them as seen in the images here, or chainmail linked around them.

Shepherds living in the mountains have reported sightings. The Barmanou is the Pakistani equivalent of the Bigfoot. The term Barmanou originating in Khowar, but now used in several Pakistani languages including Urdu, Shina, Pashto and Kashmiri. In addition to the name Barmanou there are a few local variant names as well. The proposed range of the Barmanou covers the Chitral and Karakoram Ranges, between the Pamirs and the Himalaya. This places the Barmanou between the ranges of two more-famous cryptids, the Almas of Central Asia and the Yeti of the Himalayas. The Barmanou allegedly possesses both human and apelike characteristics and has a reputation for abducting women and attempting to mate with them. It is also reported to wear animal skins upon its back and head. The Barmanou appears in the folklore of the Northern Regions of Pakistan and depending on where the stories come from it tends to be either described as an ape or a wild man. The first search in Pakistan for Bipedal Humanoid man was carried out by a Spanish zoologist living in France, Jordi Magraner, from 1987 to 1990. He wrote a paper, Les Hominid√©s reliques d'Asie Centrale, on the Pakistani cryptid ‚Äì the wild man. He later researched the Barmanou extensively in the 1990s, but was murdered in Afghanistan in 2002. Loren Coleman wrote that he \\"collected more than fifty firsthand sighting accounts, and all eyewitnesses recognized the reconstruction of Heuvelman's homo pongoides [\\"apelike man\\"--i.e., a living Neanderthal.]. They picked out homo pongoides as their match to Barmanu from Magraner's ID kit of drawings of apes, fossil men, aboriginals, monkeys, and the Minnesota Iceman.\\" In May 1994, during a search in Shishi Kuh valley, Chitral, Dr. Anne Mallasseand reported that once during a late evening she heard unusual guttural sounds which only a primitive voice-box could have produced.

It is similar to his earlier novel Stand on Zanzibar in its narrative style and dystopic outlook. It has exactly 100 titled chapters, which vary from several pages to part of one word. It was first published in 1969 with cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon, in the Ace Science Fiction Specials line issued by Ace Books. The Jagged Orbit was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1969, and won the BSFA Award for the best SF novel in 1970.  Plot summary  The novel is set in the United States in 2014, when interracial tensions have passed the breaking point. A Mafia-like cartel, the Gottschalks, are exploiting this situation to sell weapons to anyone able to buy them. A split develops within the cartel, between the conservative old men and ambitious underlings prepared to use new computer technology to pull off some spectacular coups. There are several separate strands of narrative following particular characters. James Reedeth is a young psychologist at New York's major mental health institution who is disenchanted with his job and his employer, the revered Elias Mogshack. Lyla Clay is a \\"pythoness,\\" a young woman capable of metabolising certain psychedelic drugs to enter a trance in which she makes unconscious predictions. Matthew Flamen, a \\"spoolpigeon\\" (a variety of investigative journalist), is struggling to hold onto his job, and by his obsessive behaviour has driven his wife into Mogshack's asylum. The plot is contrived to bring the strands together and resolve matters by a lengthy discussion between Flamen, Reedeth, Lyla Clay, Pedro Diablo (Flamen's African-American counterpart), Xavier Conroy (a long-time critic of Mogshack), and Harry Madison (a former patient at Mogshack's asylum).

It was created in 1942 and disbanded in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. It was named after the Immortals, an elite unit of 10,000 Persian soldiers in the army of the Achaemenid Empire. Origins Imperial Guard Headquarters in Tehran In 1921 a Persian Royal Guard was in existence comprising 20,000 men. A Guard Division was raised in 1925 by Reza Shah, incorporating both cavalry and infantry units. The Imperial Guard was subsequently formed in 1942 from 700 volunteers. It was originally designed and organized by General Jafar Shafaghat. The division was modeled after the French Republican Guard and the British Royal Horse Guards. In 1953 the unit was expanded in size to a division under General Teymur Bakhtiar. In 1972 the Lashkari Guard Division was incorporated in the Imperial Guard together with a Conscript Brigade. Structure = Javidan Guard = The core of the Imperial Guard was the all volunteer Javidan Guard (G√¢rd e J√¢vid√¢n, Persian: Immortal Guard), better known as the \\"Immortals\\" after the ancient Persian royal guard or Persian Immortals. The \\"Immortals\\" were based in the Lavizan Barracks in northern Tehran.Liz Thurgood, Bakhtiar quits after losing army backing, The Guardian, 12 February 1979 By 1978 this elite force comprised a brigade of 4,000-5,000 men, including a battalion of Chieftain tanks. It was responsible for the internal and external security of the royal palaces. A special plain-clothes unit was called Ma'mourin Makhsous. Prior to the 1967 Imperial Coronation a Pahlavi Cavalry Guard was formed, giving the Javidan Guard a Household Cavalry type mounted escort unit for ceremonial occasions. According to differing accounts this detachment was 30 to 50-strong. The last Commanding Officer of the Javidan Guard was Lieutenant- Colonel Yusuf-i-nijad. =Main Imperial Guard= By the late 1970s the entire Imperial Guard (including conscripts outside the Javidan units) was 18,000 strong, with artillery, armored and helicopter units. The entire Guard comprised some 6% of the army, and were the only troops stationed permanently in the capital Tehran. Recruitment A recruit to the Imperial Guard had to pass a series of proficiency tests, varying in subjects and difficulty. Reportedly one of the prerequisites for initiation was to be able to recite one's family history back for 23 generations from memory alone. Uniforms and insignia Imperial Guard units were distinguished by salmon (light red) coloured insignia. The Pahlavi Cavalry Guard had special blue and red ceremonial uniforms, including silver cuirasses and crested helmets. Overthrow of the last Shah The Imperial Guard remained loyal to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi until his departure for exile in January 1979. After two days of fighting on 9 through 11 February, against armed civilians and dissident Air Force and Army personnel, the Imperial Guard was withdrawn to its bases. The Guard was disbanded on 17 February 1979. The Javidan Guard was formally dissolved by the new Iranian regime, although some portions of the wider Imperial Guard remained in existence. These remaining units were stripped of their historic privileges and duties and integrated into the 21st Division of the regular Army Ground Forces. As such they saw action in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Commanders of the Imperial Guard The last commander of the Imperial Guard at the time of the 1979 Iranian Revolution was Lieutenant General Ali Neshat. One of the former Guard commanders was General Gholam Ali Oveisi (1960‚Äì1965). One of the original commanders, General Jafar Shafaghat, during the last months prior to the fall of the monarchy in 1979 was appointed by the Shah as the minister of defense (the literal translation of this post from Persian is minister of war) under Shapour Bakhtiar Cabinet until the fall of the government. Commanders of the unit were: * Capt. Jafar Shafaghat and Capt. Banandor (commanders of two rival companies with rotating responsibility) * 2nd Col.

The film stars Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, and Linda Hunt. In the film, a detective and a biologist try to defeat a South-American lizard-like monster who is on a killing spree in a Chicago Museum. Production was originally intended to be held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. However, executives were concerned that film would scare away children. The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago offered the studio to shoot the movie at their location instead, taking interest in the film's premise. Filming took place between Chicago and Los Angeles. The film was released in the United States on January 10, 1997 by Paramount Pictures and by Universal Pictures in worldwide territories. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed over $48 million worldwide. Plot Dr. John Whitney, an anthropologist for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, studies a tribe in South America and drinks a soup made by the tribesmen. Shortly after, Whitney accosts a merchant ship captain, asking him to remove the cargo he had intended to send to Chicago off the ship. Unwilling to delay the ship's departure, the captain refuses and Whitney sneaks aboard. Not finding his cargo, he cries out. Six weeks later, the ship arrives on Lake Michigan with its crew missing. Chicago PD homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta and his partner, Sgt. Hollingsworth, investigate the ship and find dozens of bodies and severed heads in the bilge. Dr. Margo Green, an evolutionary biologist, arrives at work at the museum and discovered that co-worker Dr. Greg Lee is applying for the same research grant she is. Margo and her mentor, Dr. Albert Frock, examine Whitney's crates after their arrival and find the crates empty, except for a bed of leaves and a stone statue of the \\"Kothoga\\", a mythical forest monster. Margo notices a fungus on the leaves and sends it to be analyzed. That night, security guard Frederick Ford is murdered like the ship's crew. D'Agosta suspects a connection. Believing the killer is still inside the museum, he orders it closed until the police have finished searching. Dr. Ann Cuthbert, the museum director, protests and mentions an important upcoming exhibition. Margo discovers the fungus contains concentrated hormones found in several animal species. In the container of leaves, she finds a mutated beetle that possesses both insect and reptilian DNA. Ford's autopsy reveals that his hypothalamus was extracted from his brain, like the bodies from the ship. In the museum's basement, the police are startled by a mentally-ill, homeless ex-convict and kill him. Finding Ford's wallet on him, everyone except D'Agosta considers the case closed, though Mayor Robert Owen and the museum‚Äôs head of security Tom Parkinson forces D'Agosta to let the exhibition proceed. On the opening night, D'Agosta orders a lock-down of all museum areas except the main exhibition hall. Dr. Frock and Margo, trapped in the laboratory wing, continue working and discover Ford's killer is after the hormones on the leaves. D'Agosta and several officers search the basement tunnels once again. They are attacked by an unseen creature, killing K-9 Officer Bradley and a police dog. D'Agosta tells Hollingsworth to evacuate the museum, but he is too late. In the main hall, the headless body of a murdered policeman falls into the crowd, causing a panic. During the hysteria, the museum's alarms are tripped and their security system goes haywire, trapping a small group of people inside. Two security guards try to restore the power but are killed by an unseen creature. D'Agosta meets Margo and Dr. Frock in the lab, where a Kothoga, an enormous chimeric beast, attacks them; they close a steel door to stop it. Margo theorizes the fungus mutated a smaller creature, and Dr. Frock says that without the leaves to eat, the Kothoga instinctively seeks the closest substitute, human hypothalami, until it runs out of targets and dies; he further postulates that the tribe knew of the fungus, and used it on a human or animal to deal with an external threat, then hid until the threat was destroyed and the Kothoga died of \\"starvation.\\" D'Agosta finds a radio and tells Hollingsworth to lead the museum guests out via an old coal tunnel. Tom, Greg, and benefactors Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale refuse to go, and CPD officer McNally stays behind to guard them; the Kothoga returns to the main hall and murders them and the S.W.A.T. officers who enter through the skylights. Margo suggests using liquid nitrogen to kill the Kothoga, as it is part-reptilian and likely cold-blooded. While collecting the remaining leaves in the lab, Margo and D'Agosta discover Dr. Frock has been killed. In the sewers, D'Agosta uses the leaves to lure the Kothoga away from the coal tunnel, allowing the guests to escape, though CPD officer Bailey and a guest are both killed. However, liquid nitrogen has no effect on the creature. Margo and D'Agosta flee. In the lab, her computer completes the analysis of the creature's human DNA, revealing John Whitney is the Kothoga, mutated after drinking the tribesmen's soup. The Kothoga smashes into the lab through the ceiling, while D'Agosta is locked outside. The creature chases Margo, corners her, and suddenly pauses, seemingly recognizing her. Margo starts an explosive fire that destroys the Kothoga, surviving by hiding inside a maceration tank. As dawn comes, D'Agosta and a team of police break into the lab, see the charred remains of the Kothoga, and rescue Margo from the tank.

It was developed by the team of Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy. Peter Hyams was hired to direct. \\"I don't think you can scare people, unless you involve them,\\" said Hyams. \\"A movie like this has to be intelligent.\\" Because the novel portrayed the museum's administration in an unflattering light, they turned the film's producers down. Paramount Pictures offered the museum a seven-figure sum of money to film there, but the administration was worried that the monster movie would scare kids away from the museum. The producers were faced with a problem as only museums in Chicago and Washington, D.C., resembled the one in New York. The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago loved the premise and allowed them to shoot there. Penelope Ann Miller had not done a horror film prior to The Relic but was drawn to director Peter Hyams' desire to have a strong, smart female lead. Tom Sizemore was attracted to the film because he got to play the male lead: \\"I had the responsibility of pushing the narrative forward.\\" Makeup artist Stan Winston and his team made three creatures with two people moving the heads and people on the side working the electronics to move the arms, claws, mouth, and so on. Hyams reviewed Winston's early drawings and his only suggestion was to make the monster more hideous looking. The director also suggested certain invertebrates for inspiration and Winston came up with an arachnoid outline for the monster's face. In the scenes where the creature is running or jumping, a computer-generated version was used. In addition to shooting on location in Chicago, a set was built in Los Angeles of a tunnel flooded with water. Sizemore spent most of the shoot either damp, cold or soaking wet and, as a result, caught the flu twice. The production was shut down briefly when Hyams became too sick to work. Release The Relic premiered on January 10, 1997. It opened #1 at the box office, grossing $9,064,143 its opening week and a total of $33,956,608 in the US, against an estimated cost $60 million. It was released on Blu-ray on April 6, 2010. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Relic holds an approval rating of 36%, based on 33 reviews, and an average rating of 4.74/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. James Berardinelli of Reel Views said that \\"when all is said and done, this horror/science fiction amalgamation seems like nothing more ambitious than a bad reworking of elements from Aliens, Species, Jaws, and Predator.\\" Positive reviews came from critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel; Siskel described the film as \\"surprisingly entertaining\\", and Ebert said that the film was clever in how it \\"combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres\\" and \\"is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore.\\" Film historian Leonard Maltin gave the movie 2.5 out of a possible 4 stars, summing it up as \\"Alien in a museum\\". Peter Stack of San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a mixed review, stating,\\" 'The Relic' will quickly fade to video, where it might fare well as a bump-in-the-night benefiting from the fast-forward button.\\" Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle gave the film a 2.5/5 stating, \\"Long story short: This film stands as a near-perfect specimen of two hardy cinema archetypes ‚Äì the cheesy but diverting creature feature and the weekend bargain matinee.\\" In a more negative review, Richard Harrington of The Washington Post stated, \\"It‚Äôs a familiar story in the horror film business: good novel, terrible adaptation (just ask Stephen King and Clive Barker). As written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, \\"The Relic\\" deserved to be taken off the shelf; as adapted by a quartet of screenwriters and directed by Peter Hyams, it should have been left on one.\\" The film was nominated for multiple science- fiction and fantasy awards, including best horror film and best actress (for Penelope Ann Miller) at the 1997 Saturn Awards.

In addition, a C-stand typically includes a gobo head and a gobo arm, also known as a grip head and grip arm, which provide the ability to articulate a light modifier without moving the stand itself. The legs of C stands are designed to be nested, so many stands can be placed around a light source. A secondary use of C-stands is to position smaller light fixtures. A typical use would be to offset a backlight from the stand column, so that the stand itself can be placed out of shot, while the backlight hovers somewhere above the top edge of frame. In recent years, C-stands have found a new use, supporting the brackets used for balancing Steadicam (and similar) camera sleds. These popular stands are available in many different configurations, lengths and finishes. The unique staggered leg design allows C-Stands to be nested and therefore be placed extremely close to one another on set. The lower leg can also be slid under many objects. The C+ offers a removable base for the risers, making disassembly for travel simple and easy. The sliding leg allows for use on stairs, off curbs and even as high as a desk or countertop.  History  The term C-stand comes from the early history of lighting equipment where a popular sized sun reflector was 100 inches square or \\"century\\". The term ‚ÄòCentury Stand‚Äô goes back to the early days of motion picture production. Before there was artificial lighting the stages would revolve to allow for continuous overhead lighting from the sun. Large reflectors would be positioned to bounce or kick the overhead light up onto the stage and illuminate the set and actors. These reflectors were made in many sizes but it seems the most popular was the 100 inch, or ‚Äòcentury‚Äô, sized reflector. In later years, studios, grips and gaffers began to manufacture the earliest versions of what we now call C-Stands. The original C-Stands had welded bases that did not fold up or adjust but the fact that they easily nested together made them invaluable on the stage. Century Stands or ‚ÄòC‚Äô stands are an important component in the image maker's arsenal of tools. Today the term C-stand is a popular name for the grip stand made by Matthews Studio Equipment, Inc. and has been copied by other manufacturers. In 1974 Matthews Studio Equipment introduced the industry's first folding base C-Stand. Matthews produces a wide range of C-Stands and related accessories to assist the motion picture, television and photographic professional in lighting and lighting modification support.  Use  Using a C-stand safely is a matter of proper technique, and on the job training. When setting and tightening a grip arm, flag or other equipment in the grip head, it is crucial that the gear be set to one side of the grip head such that the weight causes the locking knob to tighten clockwise, or \\"righty tighty\\". Failure to follow this rule will cause the weight to slowly loosen the head, eventually dropping the gear altogether. Since a stand is used to hold a piece of gear high above or far off to the side, the base of the stand must be weighed down, commonly with sandbags. The bag is slung over the top of the tall stand leg so the weight is fully on the stand and not the ground. Types A C-stand is sometimes referred to as a \\"grip stand\\". The Grip department always‚Äîand sometimes the electrical department‚Äîcarries C stands for use with lights that don't mount onto baby or junior stands, such as kinos. A \\"baby C-stand\\" is only 20 inches at its shortest height. It is nicknamed a \\"Gary Coleman\\" or a \\"Billy Barty\\" stand in the US. In the UK a short flag stand with stubby legs is called a \\"shotgun\\" flag stand (a reference to the stand having been \\"sawn off\\"). A C-stand with a removable base is called a C-stand with a turtle base. The opening at the top of the turtle base accepts the base of c-stand upright or a junior pin. Turtle bases are great for setting up a light very low to the ground. A C-stand with an upper most leg which is moveable on the vertical axis is called a Stair Leg C-stand or a Sliding Leg C-Stand, as the unit can be placed on a stairway. Also called a Rocky Mountain Leg. A Punky C-Stand is a 20\\" C-Stand with a smaller base and footprint than the standard 20\\" size. C-Stands come in sizes multiple sizes: 20\\", 30\\", 40\\", and 60\\" - the most common sizes are 20\\" and 40\\". They may be chrome or black.

Legal framework =Constitutional rights= The \\"Fundamental Freedoms\\" section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states: :2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: ::(a) freedom of conscience and religion; ::(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; ::(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and ::(d) freedom of association. Canadians are therefore free to have their own beliefs and opinions, are free to practise religion or refrain, and are free to establish media organizations with or without religious content. Canadian religious institutions generally benefit from charitable organization status, which allows supporters to benefit from tax credits or deductions for their financial contributions. According to the Charter's preamble, Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God.Quoted from the Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms This portion of the preamble has not been accorded legal effect in Charter jurisprudence.R. v. Sharpe, 1999 BCCA 416 at 79.R. v. Sharpe SCC 2001 The constitutional recognition of God has been criticized as conflicting in principle with the fundamental freedom of conscience and religion guaranteed in section 2, as it would disadvantage those who hold nontheistic or polytheistic beliefs, including atheism and Buddhism.Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto, Canada: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982. Paul Russell, \\"The supremacy of God\\" does not belong in the Constitution\\": The Globe & Mail, June 11, 1999 As well, the Charter's preamble recognizes the rule of law, a principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials. =Human rights codes= While religious freedoms are protected from state interference by the Charter, the actions of private individuals are largely governed by the provincial human rights codes. These codes prohibit discrimination in the marketplace, accommodation, and employment on the grounds of a variety of personal characteristics, including religion. There is also a federal statute, the Canadian Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in workplaces and businesses under federal jurisdiction, such as banks and airlines. The Act prohibits religious discrimination. =Case law= The Supreme Court Building in Ottawa In 1955, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Chaput v. Romain, regarding Jehovah's Witnesses, that all religions have equal rights, based upon tradition and the rule of law. At the time, no statutes formed the basis for this argument.McLachlin, \\"Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law: A Canadian Perspective\\", pages 19-20. In the Guibord case in 1874, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, ruled that the civil courts of Canada have the jurisdiction to resolve disputes between members of a church and the church organization.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al (1874), L.R. 6 P.C. 157, [1874 UKPC 70] (P.C.). The basis for the ruling was that churches are required to comply with their own internal rules and laws, and members of the church have the right to be treated in accordance with those internal rules and laws. In the specific point in issue in the Guibord case, the Judicial Committee ruled that the Roman Catholic church in Montreal could not refuse the burial of a deceased member of the church because of his political views. In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem,Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem, 2004 SCC 47, [2004] 2 SCR 551. the Supreme Court of Canada provided a two-pronged test to introduce a freedom of religion claim: first, a demonstration of practice or a belief having a nexus with religion. Second, the person has to be sincere in his/her belief. The court also stated that the practice in question does not have to be mandatory to the religion, or observed by all who practice the religion. What is important is that the practice has a nexus with religion (see para 44 of the judgment). In Mouvement la√Øque qu√©b√©cois v Saguenay (City), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that municipal councils cannot open their meetings with a prayer, since it infringed on freedom of conscience and religion. The ruling ended a legal case that started with a complaint filed by atheist Alain Simoneau and the Mouvement la√Øque qu√©b√©cois against Saguenay, QC Mayor Jean Tremblay. Reasonable accommodation on religious grounds =Legal basis= Equality of all individuals is guaranteed by Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s 15, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11. This section promotes the pursuance of equality and the refusal of discrimination under enumerated or analogous grounds. However, the Charter only protects individuals from actions, policies and norms of public entities, not from private persons and organizations.Library of Parliament, Legal and Legislative Affairs Division, Parliamentary Information and Research Service, An Examination of the Duty to Accommodate in the Canadian Human Rights Context (January 2012) at 1. :Section 15 of the Charter states: ::15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. ::(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. To enlarge the scope of protection, the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA)Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 in section 3(1) forbids discrimination on prohibited grounds by actors that fall under federal jurisdiction, such as television, and federally regulated industries.Library of Parliament, footnote 4 Canadian provinces have their own human rights legislations that can be explicit as to the notion of reasonable accommodation. In Manitoba, section 9(1)(d) of the Human Rights Code defines discrimination as a \\"failure to make reasonable accommodation for the special needs of any individual or group if those special needs are based upon\\"Manitoba, Human Rights Code, CCSM, cH175 prohibited grounds. These provincial legislations oblige actors under their jurisdiction (employers, service providers and landlords) to respect the duty to accommodate, to preserve a multicultural society. The particularity of the duty to accommodate on religious grounds is that cases fall both under the jurisdiction of the Charter and other federal and provincial human rights acts and that they challenge the notions of social values, secularism and gender equality.Library of Parliament, at 7. =Definition= The notion of reasonable accommodation is a judicial creation.St√©phane Bernatchez, \\"Accommodements raisonnables et gouvernance : le r√¥le du juge, au-del√† de l'interpr√©tation et de la cr√©ation du droit de l'√©galit√©\\" in Reasonable Accommodation and the Role of the State: A Democratic Challenge, eds Christian Brunelle & Patrick A Molinari (Montreal: Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, 2008) 371 at 379. It implies that \\"federal/provincial/territorial anti-discrimination measures place a positive duty on employers, service providers and landlords [...] to accommodate people's needs for reasons associated with recognized discriminatory grounds.\\"Library of Parliament, at 2. According to Sandra Fredman, the duty of reasonable accommodation \\"represents and advance towards substantive equality\\" for three reasons. Firstly, \\"equality is explicitly asymmetric, aiming to redress disadvantage even if this entails different or more favourable treatment.\\" Secondly, it is focused \\"on modifying the environment to facilitate the participation of those affected.\\" Finally, \\"[it] goes beyond other conceptions of equality in that it expressly imposes a positive duty to make changes.\\"Sandra Fredman, at 215-217. The notion of reasonable accommodation is directly related to the freedom of religion. Indeed, in 2006, \\"the Multani decision [...] moved reasonable accommodation from the realm of employment law into a broader legal discourse on religious freedom more generally.\\"Lori G. Beaman, \\"Conclusion: Alternatives to Reasonable Accommodation\\" in Lori G. Beaman ed, Reasonable Accommodation: Managing Religious Diversity (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2012) 208 at 209. In claims concerning discrimination on religious grounds, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, landlord or service provider who has to prove the two elements: (1) that the rule is necessary and (2) he accommodates the individual to the point of undue hardship.Ont. Human Rights Comm. v Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536. =Limits= The duty of reasonable accommodation on religious grounds experiences some limits, because all rights are not absolutes.Gilles Trudeau, \\"L'obligation d'accommodement en milieu de travail : √©volution ou r√©volution ?\\" in Jean-Fran√ßois Gaudreault-DesBiens ed, Le Droit, la Religion et le \\" Raisonnable \\", (Montreal: Les √âditions Th√©mis, 2009) 169 at 175. Indeed, reasonable accommodation requires a balance between the rights of the claimant and the holder of the duty to accommodate.Library of Parliament, at 3. The main limit to the duty to accommodate that is included in the CHRA is the notion of undue hardship. It signifies that the discriminatory practice can be justified if the duty holder demonstrates that the required accommodation weights too much on him. The undue hardship includes \\"health, safety and cost.\\"Canadian Human Rights Act, s 15(2) Professor Christian Brunelle divides the evaluation criteria in three categories:Gilles Trudeau, \\"L'obligatin d'accommodement en milieu de travail : √©volution ou r√©volution ?\\" in Jean- Fran√ßois Gaudreault-DesBiens ed, Le Droit, la Religion et le \\"Raisonnable\\", (Montreal: Les √âditions Th√©mis, 2009) 169 at 176. the limits of financial and material resources of the company/institution, the breach of the victim's rights, and the proper functioning of the company/institution. The judge also takes into account the reasonable feature of the controversial policy, rule or norm, the effort of accommodation by the duty holder, and the excessive feature of the constraint.Jos√© Woehrling, \\"L'obligation d'accommodement raisonnable et l'adaptation de la soci√©t√© √† la diversit√© religieuse\\" (1998) 43 McGill LJ 325 et 341. Courts generally agree that the complainant has to take steps towards accommodation or \\"must either sacrifice his religious principles or his employment\\". In Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed whether the obligation to have a photograph on the driver's license violated the Hutterites' right to freedom of religion. The Court found that there was a prima facie discrimination but considered that the need to both protect the integrity of the licensing system and combat identity fraud was a justified limitation on the community's religious freedom. This decision illustrates another limit to reasonable accommodation: public interest. The Court explains that \\"[g]iving effect to each of their religious claims could seriously undermine the universality of many regulatory programs [...] to the overall detriment of the community.\\"Alberta v Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37 at para 36. =Impacts= The duty of reasonable accommodation has a major impact on the promotion of multiculturalism protected under Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Professor Errol P. Mendes suggests that reasonable accommodation is part of the \\"Canadian paradigm\\", in contradistinction with the French \\"la√Øcit√©.\\"Errol P. Mendes, \\"Being Reasonable about Reasonable Accommodation of Minority Religious Practices and Symbols; A Global Challenge in an Era of Diversity\\" in Christian Brunelle & Patrick A Molinari eds, Reasonable Accommodation and the Role of the State: A Democratic Challenge (Montreal: Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, 2008) 205 at 212. Besides the cases brought to courts, there are many examples of reasonable accommodation negotiated in a non-judiciary context. One example is the decision of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to allow Sikh adherents to wear religious signs when serving the RCMP (e.g. the turban, the beard and the dagger.) The federal court decided that this decision did not infringe the Charter.Grant v Canada, [1995] 1 FC 158, affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal aff'g (1995), 96 FTR 239, 125 DLR (4th) 556, and the Supreme Court of Canada [1996] 1 SCR vii, 130 DLR (4th) vii. Other illustrations exist. It is the case of some municipalities that decided that the public swimming pool should be separated between men and women 3 hours a week (1h30 each) to accommodate observant Muslims.Conseil des communaut√©s culturelles et de l'immigration du Qu√©bec, La gestion des conflits de normes par les organisations dans le contexte pluraliste de la soci√©t√© qu√©b√©coise : principes de fond et de proc√©dure pour guider la recherche d'accommodements raisonnables (Montreal : Avis pr√©sent√© √† la ministre des Communaut√©s culturelles et de l'immigration, 1993) at 63. It was also brought up with the decision of the Quebec Soccer Federation to lift the prohibition on Sikh head coverings. The duty of reasonable accommodation presents particular issues in the province of Quebec. Some describe it as a \\"subject of high controversy\\"Ian Binnie, \\"Putting Reasonable Accommodation in Historical Perspective\\" in Christian Brunelle & Patrick A Molinari eds, Reasonable Accommodation and the Role of the State: A Democratic Challenge, (Montreal: Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, 2008) 7 at 7. and as threatening \\"the collective values chosen by Quebecers to govern their collective existence\\".Ian Binnie, at 7. Surveys showed that 71.7% of Quebecers whose mother tongue is French found today's society \\"overly tolerant of accommodation\\", whereas only 35.2% of Quebecers having another mother tongue shared this opinion.G√©rard Bouchard & Charles Taylor, Building the Future. A Time for Reconciliation. Report (Quebec: Commission sur les pratiques d'accommodement reli√©es aux diff√©rences culturelles) at 66. Specific freedoms =Religious speech= In a 1985 Supreme Court case involving the Lord's Day Act, R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., Chief Justice Brian Dickson said that religious freedom in Canada includes freedom of religious speech, including \\"the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination.\\" Canada has laws prohibiting the promotion of hatred against sections of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. However, there are exemptions in the Bill which permit the expression of opinions on religious subjects and opinions based on religious texts which would otherwise be prohibited. In 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the anti-Semitic publications of a New Brunswick schoolteacher, challenged under provincial Human Rights Act, were protected by his right to freedom of religion, but that professional sanctions were a reasonable limit on that right, to maintain \\"a school system that is free from bias, prejudice and intolerance.\\"Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15 , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825. In 1997, Hugh Owens, a Saskatchewan prison guard, published an advertisement in the Star-Phoenix that referenced Bible verses related to homosexuality (without quoting them) and drew a line through an image representing a gay couple. A complaint was lodged with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Board of Inquiry. The Board ruled against Owens and that decision was also upheld by a lower court. On April 13, 2006 the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal overturned the previous decisions, ruling that while Owens's advertisement was \\"offensive and jarring to many\\", it was not illegal. The court also ruled that statements which are designed to provoke \\"extreme emotions and strong feelings of detestation, calumny and vilification\\" may be deemed as hate speech.Law Society of Saskatchewan, Case Commentary, Owens v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) . Retrieved May 16, 2006 In 2000, Rev. Ken Campbell successfully defended against an Ontario Human Rights Commission complaint filed after he placed an advertisement in The Globe and Mail newspaper where he protested a Supreme Court of Canada ruling calling for Alberta to amend the Human Rights Code regarding LGBT issues. The ad began with \\"Supreme Court has no business imposing 'bathhouse morality' on the churches and in the living rooms of the nation.\\" Two years later he successfully defended against a complaint filed at the BC Human Rights Tribunal for the same advertisement, with the decision stating \\"The essence of Mr. Campbell's defence is that the publication... is an expression of his Charter-protected rights to express his religious beliefs; that is, a finding of discrimination would impair both his freedom of expression and his freedom of religion.\\"\\"Rights complaint over ad rejected\\", Toronto Star, April 7, 2000 Another high-profile case involves Chris Kempling, a school teacher, who was suspended without pay in 2002 for writing letters to a local newspaper objecting to the introduction of LGBT-related material into the public school system, arguing against same-sex marriage, and advocating conversion therapy for gay and lesbian persons. Kempling appealed the suspension to the courts. The British Columbia Court of Appeal found that his right to freedom of expression had been breached, but that the disciplinary action was a reasonable limit on his rights, as it was done with the objective of maintaining a tolerant and non-discriminatory school system.BC Court of Appeal June 13 2005 Decision. Retrieved April 21, 2006 =Sabbath and holiday observance= In R. v. Big M Drug Mart, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the stated purpose of the federal Lord's Day Act, compelling observance of the Christian Sabbath, was incompatible with the protections of freedom of religion in the Charter. In 1986, in R v Edwards Books and Art Ltd, the Supreme Court found that legislation prohibiting Sunday shopping with the secular purpose of creating a day of rest was also a violation of freedom of religion because of the unequal effect of the law on retailers who observed a different sabbath. However, this violation was upheld as a justifiable limit on freedom of religion. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that there is a duty to accommodate religious observance under human rights legislation. The 1990 case Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta concerned an employee who was required by his religion to take Easter Monday as a holy day. As this is not a statutory holiday, his employer required that he work that day or lose his job. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the employer should have accommodated the employee's religious practices. =Religious dress= In a 1985 court case involving an employee of the Canadian National Railway, K.S. Bhinder, a Sikh whose religion required that he wear a turban, lost his challenge of the CNR policy that required him to wear a hard hat. In the 1990 case of Central Alberta Dairy Pool, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the 1985 Bhinder decision, saying: \\"An employer that has not adopted a policy with respect to accommodation and cannot otherwise satisfy the trier of fact that individual accommodation would result in undue hardship will be required to justify his conduct with respect to the individual complainant. Even then the employer can invoke the BFOQ (bona fide occupational qualification) defence.\\" In the 1991 case of Peel Board of Education v. Ontario Human Rights Commission, an Ontario school board's \\"zero tolerance\\" for weapons in its schools had an adverse impact on Khalsa Sikh men who are required by their religion to carry a kirpan, a ceremonial dagger. A Khalsa Sikh teacher brought a complaint under the Ontario Human Rights Code and was successful. The school board challenged this to the Ontario Divisional Court on the basis that there was a threat to public safety. The Divisional Court ruled that the threat to public safety from Sikhs was minimal and the discriminatory impact of the ruling on this religious group was significant. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‚ÄëBourgeoys that Sikh children can wear a kirpan to school based on freedom of religion. In 1995, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the exemption for Sikhs from wearing the \\"Mountie hat\\" as part of the RCMP dress requirements. =Marital practice= Prior to 1798, only ministers of the Church of England had the authority to solemnize legal marriages in Upper Canada. This power was extended by degrees to religious officials of various other Christian denominations over the first half of the 19th century, until an 1857 act granted the power to solemnize marriages to the ministers of every religious denomination. A similar process occurred in Lower Canada, with the main difference being that it was the Roman Catholic Church which initially held the sole authority.Arnup, Katherine, Close Personal Relationships between Adults: 100 Years of Marriage in Canada . Ottawa: The Law Commission of Canada, 2001. Polygamous marriages, promoted by some religious minority groups, are illegal in Canada. Authorities often do not strictly enforce the applicable laws, as has been the case in Bountiful, British Columbia. On January 12, 2006, the Department of Justice (Canada) released a study, authored by three law professors at Queen's University, recommending that Canada repeal the laws that make polygamy a criminal offence.\\"Study recommends repealing polygamy ban in Canada\\", National Post, January 12, 2006. Retrieved May 14, 2006 See related article, Polygamy and religion. In the 2003 case Halpern et al. v. Attorney General of Canada et al., the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected the argument that a failure of the law to recognize same-sex marriages violated the religious rights of the church that performed the ceremonies, though the court found the definition of marriage to be unconstitutional on other grounds. =Refusal of service= In 2000, a Board of Inquiry appointed under the Ontario Human Rights Code found that Scott Brockie, a Toronto printer, had discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation by refusing to print letterhead, envelopes, and business cards for the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives. The Board of Inquiry ordered Brockie to pay damages of $5,000 to the two complainants who had brought the complaint.Ontario Human Rights Commission, Annual Report 2001-2002. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Brockie, 2000 CarswellOnt 5474, 37 C.H.R.R. D/15. Brockie unsuccessfully appealed to Ontario Superior Court (Divisional Court) to overturn the decision.Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Brockie, 2002 CarswellOnt 2518, Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Brockie 2002 CarswellOnt 2518 The divisional court ruled that the order requiring Brockie to print the materials was a justifiable violation of Brockie's religious rights. However, the court limited the scope of the Board of Inquiry's ruling to only ordinary material such as letterhead and envelopes. The court said the Board of Inquiry's order \\"ought not to require Mr. Brockie to print material of a nature that could reasonably be considered to be in direct conflict with the core elements of his religious beliefs.\\"Ontario Humans Rights Commission, 2002 Case Summaries. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Brockie, 2002 CarswellOnt 2518 Ont. Sup. Ct. (Div.Ct.), para. 58. In 2002, the Rainbow Harmony Project, a choir that supports LGBT persons, filed a complaint against Camp Arnes of Manitoba, after the camp denied them access. The complaint was settled, with both parties issuing a joint statement that the conflict had resulted from uncertainty regarding that nature of the camp's rental operations, and the acknowledgement that they were \\"part of its broader religious mission and outreach and not primarily a commercial activity.\\"Manitoba Human Rights Commission, [News Release http://www.manitobahumanrights.ca/publications/news_releases/pdf/2006_08_17.pdf], August 17, 2006. Court rulings in Saskatchewan have held that religious-based objections of provincial marriage commissioners to same-sex marriage do not need to be accommodated, because refusal by a government-appointed marriage commissioner to perform same-sex marriages would constitute a violation of the Charter equality rights of gay and lesbian individuals. In 2008, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal held that marriage commissioner Orville Nichols had discriminated against a same-sex couple by refusing to perform their marriage ceremony. The Tribunal ordered him to pay $2,500 in compensation to the couple. In 2009, the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench upheld the Tribunal's decision.Nichols v. M.J., 2009 SKQB 299. In response to a reference question from the Government of Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled in 2011 that two proposed bills which would have permitted marriage commissioners to refuse to perform same-sex marriages because of religious objections would be unconstitutional. Ordained religious ministers in Canada are not required to marry same-sex couples. A poll conducted in October 2006 found that 57% of Canadians believe that a marriage commissioner should be able to refuse to officiate at a gay wedding so long as there are enough marriage commissioners available, and 72% felt that clergy should have the right to refuse to officiate if doing so would violate his or her religious beliefs.Don't force clergy to marry gays: majority, National Post, October 30, 2006.

British Columbia College of Teachers that the British Columbia College of Teachers was wrong to withhold accreditation of Trinity Western University's teacher education program on the basis that the school's policy prohibited \\"homosexual behaviour\\".\\"Canada's Supreme Court upheld freedom of religion\\", The Cambridge Reporter, July 6, 2001 In a highly publicized 2002 case, Justice Robert McKinnon granted an interlocutory injunction ordering that Marc Hall be allowed to bring a same-sex date to prom at his Oshawa, Ontario Catholic high school.\\"Catholic prom may set crucial legal precedent\\", The Globe and Mail, May 9, 2002 The matter did not, however, proceed to trial, meaning no binding judgment on the merits of the case was issued. =Mandating opposing curricula= In 2006, the Province of British Columbia moved to make changes that would require religious schools to teach LGBT-friendly educational material; however, the British Columbia government indicated that changes to the public education system were not intended to prevent religious schools from teaching their ethical codes of behaviour.\\"Gay couple gets input in school curriculum\\", National Post, June 16, 2006. Retrieved June 16, 2006 In 2006, an independent Christian Evangelical school in Quebec was ordered by its school board to teach Darwin's theory of evolution and a comprehensive sex education program, a requirement that does not exist in some other provinces.\\"Evangelical schools ordered to teach Darwin\\", National Post, October 24, 2006. Retrieved October 25, 2006 In response, the Quebec Ministry of Education negotiated with an unspecified number of Evangelical schools on a working curriculum that would not violate the basic legal educational requirements. = Loyola High School v Quebec (Attorney General) = In 2008 Paul Donovan, the principal of a Jesuit catholic high school in Quebec, objected to a government mandated course on religion and ethics. The ethics and religious culture course, ERC as it is called, is a provincially mandated course that requires schools to teach the basic traditions and symbolisms of a variety of religions. Donovan argued on behalf of Loyola High School that the ERC forbids teachers from teaching, in detail, the reasons why a given religious faith believes what it does believe; any form of instruction that could be perceived as an endorsement of a particular religion or proclaiming it as truth is prohibited and therefore seen by Donovan as a violation of religious freedom, as outlined in the Quebec Charter of Values. An additional concern is that government imposed religious and ethical curricula on institutions like Loyola, could be precedent-setting for government control on other faith based institutions such as churches and associated religious organizations. All schools in Quebec, including religious, private schools, and home schools are obliged by the law to offer the ERC. If faith based schools want to continue their traditional faith education, they are permitted to do so, however it must be in addition to but separate from the ERC. This is viewed by the law's opponents as closed secularism, as opposed to open secularism, and a perversion of the proper understanding of pluralism and, of most concern, a breach of their right to teach the faith. A Quebec Superior Court agreed with the school's position in 2010, but in 2012 an appellate court sided with the government. On further appeal the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Minister's decision to force the teaching of Catholicism from a neutral standpoint unreasonably violated religious freedom, and was sent back to the Minister for reconsideration.

This motor disorder is characterized by an inability to maintain a position, which is demonstrated by jerking movements of the outstretched hands when bent upward at the wrist. The tremor is caused by abnormal function of the diencephalic motor centers in the brain, which regulate the muscles involved in maintaining position. Asterixis is associated with various encephalopathies due especially to faulty metabolism. The term derives from the Greek a, \\"not\\" and stƒìrixis, \\"fixed position\\". Asterixis is the inability to maintain posture due to a metabolic encephalopathy. This can be elicited on physical exam by having the patient extend their arms and bend their hands back. With a metabolic encephalopathy, the patient is unable to hold their hands back resulting in a ‚Äúflapping‚Äù motion consistent with asterixis. It can be seen in any metabolic encephalopathy e.g. chronic kidney failure, severe congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure and commonly in decompensated liver failure. Associated conditions and presentation Usually there are brief, arrhythmic interruptions of sustained voluntary muscle contraction causing brief lapses of posture, with a frequency of 3‚Äì5 Hz. It is bilateral, but may be asymmetric. Unilateral asterixis may occur with structural brain disease.Agarwal R, Baid R. Asterixis. J Postgrad Med 2016;62:115-7. Available from: http://www.jpgmonline.com/text.asp?2016/62/2/115/180572 * It can be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy, damage to brain cells presumably due to the inability of the liver to metabolize ammonia to urea. The cause is thought to be predominantly related to abnormal ammonia metabolism.Anne M. Larson, Diagnosis and management of acute liver failure, Curr Opin Gastroenterol., 2010, 26(3):212:221, 2010 * Asterixis is seen most often in drowsy or stuporous patients with metabolic encephalopathies, especially in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. * It is also seen in some patients with kidney failure and azotemia. * It can also be a feature of Wilson's disease. * Asterixis is also seen in respiratory failure due to carbon dioxide toxicity (hypercapnia). *Some drugs are known to cause asterixis, particularly phenytoin (when it is known as phenytoin flap). Other drugs implicated include benzodiazepines,salicylates, barbiturates, valproate, gabapentin, lithium, ceftazidime, and metoclopramide. History R.D. Adams and J.M. Foley first described asterixis in 1949 in patients with severe liver failure and encephalopathy.Adams RD, Foley JM. The neurological changes in the more common types of severe liver disease. Trans American Neurology Association 1949; 74: 217‚Äì219. Initially Foley and Adams referred to asterixis simply as \\"tremor\\" but realized that they needed a more appropriate term. On a literature search they found a poorly described phenomenon in similar patients mentioned by German physicians called ‚Äújactitations‚Äù but the reference was vague. Foley consulted Father Cadigan, a Jesuit classics scholar, who suggested ‚Äúanisosterixis‚Äù (an \\"negative\\"‚Äìiso \\"equal\\"‚Äìsterixis \\"firmness\\") but Foley shortened this to asterixis due to the former being too difficult to pronounce. They introduced the term in 1953 by way of a medical abstract and later Adams solidified its medical use as he was an author and editor of the widely influential Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.Pal G, Lin, Laureno R.

In politics, triangulation is the strategy in which a political candidate presents their ideology as being above or between the left and right sides (or \\"wings\\") of a democratic political spectrum. It involves adopting for oneself some of the ideas of one's political opponent. The logic behind it is that it both takes credit for the opponent's ideas, and insulates the triangulator from attacks on that particular issue. Origins The term was first used by U.S. President Bill Clinton's former chief political advisor Dick Morris as a way to describe his strategy for getting Clinton reelected in the 1996 presidential election. In Dick Morris' words, triangulation meant \\"the president needed to take a position that not only blended the best of each party's views but also transcended them to constitute a third force in the debate.\\" In news articles and books, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Clintonian triangulation\\". Morris advocated a set of policies that were different from the traditional policies of the Democratic Party. These policies included deregulation and balanced budgets. One of the most widely cited capstones of Clinton's triangulation strategy was when, in his 1996 State of the Union Address, Clinton declared that the \\"era of big government is over.\\" Recent use Politicians alleged to have used triangulation more recently include US President Barack Obama,How tax cut revolt helps Obama: It's a page from Clinton playbook \\"Perhaps President Obama's tax-cut deal with the GOP was astute, after all. While he angered liberals, he also won back some independent support ‚Äì an example of Clintonian 'triangulation.'\\" former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Tony Blair with \\"New Labour\\" in the United Kingdom, Jean Chr√©tien and Paul Martin with the Liberal Party of Canada, Fredrik Reinfeldt with \\"The New Moderates\\" in Sweden, and Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, and Kevin Rudd of the Australian Labor Party. During the 2010 State of the Union Address, President Obama insisted that he would remain with his agenda in the face of criticism, rather than resort to triangulation.

The two-issue story, written by Gerry Conway, with pencil art by Gil Kane and inking by John Romita Sr. and Tony Mortellaro, features Spider-Man's fight against his nemesis, the Green Goblin. The Green Goblin abducts Spider-Man's girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and she is killed during the battle. Plot The Amazing Spider- Man #122 (June 1973). Cover art by John Romita Sr. Prior to this arc, Norman Osborn had been the Green Goblin, but due to amnesia, he had suspended his identity as the supervillain and forgotten that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Also, Harry Osborn, Parker's best friend and Norman's son, became addicted to drugs and was sequestered in the Osborn home for detoxification. Norman's parental grief, combined with financial pressure, triggered a breakdown resulting in Norman Osborn remembering his Goblin identity and again targeting Spider-Man and his loved ones for misery. The Green Goblin abducts Peter's girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, and lures Spider-Man to a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text).Saffel, Steve. Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon (Titan Books, 2007) , p. 65, states, \\"In the battle that followed atop the Brooklyn Bridge (or was it the George Washington Bridge?)....\\" On page 66, Saffel reprints the panel of The Amazing Spider-Man #121, page 18, in which Spider-Man exclaims, \\"The George Washington Bridge! It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president. He's got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills!\\" Saffel states \\"The span portrayed...is the GW's more famous cousin, the Brooklyn Bridge. ... To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale, though, Spider-Man's dialogue was altered so that he's referring to the Brooklyn Bridge. But the original snafu remains as one of the more visible errors in the history of comics.\\"Sanderson, Peter. Marvel Universe: The Complete Encyclopedia of Marvel's Greatest Characters (Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1998) , p. 84, notes, \\"[W]hile the script described the site of Gwen's demise as the George Washington Bridge, the art depicted the Brooklyn Bridge, and there is still no agreement as to where it actually took place.\\" The Goblin and Spider-Man clash, and the Goblin hurls Stacy off the bridge. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at her legs and catches her. As he pulls her up, he thinks he has saved her, however he quickly realizes she is dead. Unsure whether her neck was broken by the whiplash from her sudden stop or had been already broken by the Goblin prior to her fall, he blames himself for her death. A note on the letters page of The Amazing Spider-Man #125 states: \\"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.\\" The Green Goblin escapes, and Spider- Man cries over Stacy's corpse and swears revenge. The following issue, Spider- Man tracks the Green Goblin to a warehouse and beats him but cannot bring himself to kill him. The Goblin uses the opportunity to send his glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Warned by his spider-sense, Spider-Man dodges, and the glider instead impales the Green Goblin, seemingly killing him. Later, a devastated Parker, back at home, encounters an equally shocked and saddened Mary Jane Watson, who has lost a close friend with Gwen's death, and the two attempt to comfort each other in the wake of their loss. Significance *The death of Gwen Stacy shocked the American comic book community. Previously, it had been unthinkable to kill off such an important character‚Äîthe girlfriend of a protagonist with a large fanbase. Generally, a superhero did not fail this disastrously unless it was part of his or her origin story. This story arc has been proposed as a marker of the end of the Silver Age of Comic Books, and the beginning of the darker, grittier Bronze Age. *The frequent tendency for the wives and girlfriends of male superheroes to meet grim fates was referred to as \\"The Gwen Stacy Syndrome\\" by the Comics Buyer's Guide. *A fan poll conducted by Marvel Comics for their series The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time voted The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 1) #121 and 122 to be the 6th and 19th greatest issues of all time, respectively.Spider-Man In The 100 Greatest Marvels Of All Time Development =Behind the scenes= Inker John Romita Sr. recalled in a 2015 interview how the character to be killed off for what became The Night Gwen Stacy Died was selected. Romita and Amazing Spider-Man writer Gerry Conway were initially asked by the editors to kill off Aunt May. They organized a plot session at Conway's apartment and disagreed with killing Aunt May, opining that if she were to die, Peter would not have to worry about her anymore and be no longer treated as a child again, thus deciding to kill either Mary Jane Watson or Gwen Stacy. Romita proposed to kill the latter as the former served as a comical character at the time, taking inspiration of the decisions to kill off character from Milton Caniff, author of the Terry and the Pirates and Steve Canyon comic strips. Stan Lee, co-creator of both Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy, was consulted by Conway, editor Roy Thomas and Romita about killing Gwen Stacy. When asked about how he accepted the decision, Lee said: \\"... I was just getting ready to go to Europe on some sort of a business trip... to meet somebody to discuss something about Marvel. And I think I wasn't thinking too clearly, because when they said, 'We'd like to kill Gwen Stacy,' I said, 'Well, if that's what you want to do, okay.' All I wanted to do was get them out of the office so I could finish packing and get out of there. ... and when I came back and found out that Gwen had been killed, I thought 'Why would they do that? Why would Gerry write anything like that?' And I had to be reminded later on that I had perhaps reluctantly or perhaps carelessly said 'Okay' when they asked me.\\" Conversely, Romita recalls that Lee was already out of the country when the decision was made and that they took a time to talk him into it, yet Lee remained very upset. In the comic book collection The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time: #9-6 (Amazing Spider-Man #121 was the #6 comic), Conway explained that Gwen and Peter were a \\"perfect couple\\", but taking that relationship to the next level (i.e. marriage or at least Peter revealing his secret identity to her) would \\"betray everything that Spider-Man was about\\", i.e. personal tragedy and anguish as root of Peter's life as Spider-Man. Killing Gwen Stacy was a perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: breaking up the \\"unfitting\\" relationship and reinforcing the element of personal tragedy which was, in his opinion, the essence of Spider-Man. =Bridge= The bridge in the original issue of Amazing Spider-Man #121 was stated in the text to be the George Washington Bridge. The Pulse #4 (Sept. 2004) also states the bridge to be the George Washington Bridge. The art of The Amazing Spider-Man #121, however, depicts the Brooklyn Bridge. Some reprints of the issue have had the text amended and now state the bridge to be the Brooklyn Bridge rather than the George Washington Bridge. Titles supporting the Brooklyn Bridge include The Amazing Spider-Man #147-148 (1975), The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 (1987), and Daredevil v. 2 #8 (2000). In a television interview for the Travel Channel's Marvel Superheroes Guide to New York City (2004), Stan Lee said that the artist for the issue had drawn the Brooklyn Bridge, but that he (as editor) mistakenly labeled it the George Washington Bridge. This was corrected in newer prints of the issue. Different bridges are depicted in subsequent adaptations of the storyline. Mary Jane Watson was thrown off the Queensboro Bridge in both Ultimate Spider-Man #25 and the Spider-Man movie, while in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, Mary Jane is thrown off the George Washington Bridge. =Cause of death= Gwen Stacy's death in The Amazing Spider-Man #121. The comic features a \\"snap\\" sound effect next to Gwen Stacy's head in the panel in which Spider-Man's webbing catches her. In The Amazing Spider-Man #125 (Oct. 1973), Marvel Comics editor Roy Thomas wrote in the letters column that \\"it saddens us to have to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her. In short, it was impossible for Peter to save her. He couldn't have swung down in time; the action he did take resulted in her death; if he had done nothing, she still would certainly have perished. There was no way out.\\" In the History Channel special Spider-Man Tech, Stan Lee states that her neck was indeed snapped. Physicist and comic collector James Kakalios, in his book The Physics of Superheroes, states that in the real world, the whiplash effect would have killed her.Kakalios, James (2005). The Physics of Superheroes Gotham Books: New York. . The comic book Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man (2007) concurred that the proximate cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An issue of Peter Parker: Spider-Man revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing. For some time, however, fans speculated that the shock of the fall itself caused Gwen Stacy's death, due to the Green Goblin telling Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man #121, \\"Romantic idiot! She was dead before your webbing reached her! A fall from that height would kill anyone ‚Äî before they struck the ground!\\" In the 1987 edition of The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Gwen's death is attributed to the fall, not to Spider-Man's webbing. In the fourth issue of Marvels, it was reported that she died from the shock of the fall, however Phil, a photographer and witness, is unsure about exactly what kills her. =Replays= Several subsequent issues have echoed Gwen's death when others fell from great heights during Spider-Man's battles. On most occasions, he saves them by jumping after them and working with their momentum, rather than trying to stop them with his webbing (as he did in the What If? where he saves Gwen), most notably when he jumped off the same bridge to save Gwen's daughter, Sarah Stacy, around seven years after her death; due to accelerated aging caused by her Goblin-enhanced mutated body chemistry - Sarah's father being Norman Osborn after a brief affair between Gwen and Osborn - Sarah looks exactly like her mother. In another storyline, the Green Goblin once again replays the scenario, this time with Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson-Parker. As with Gwen, Mary Jane plummets toward her death (this time from the recoil from her gun when she shoots at the Green Goblin). Learning from his previous error, Spider-Man uses multiple weblines and catches every major joint, saving Mary Jane from suffering the same whiplash effect that killed Gwen.Marvel Knights Spider-Man #12 A similar event occurs when Spider-Man saves Anna Maria‚Äîthe girlfriend of Otto Octavius during a time when he was in Spider-Man's body‚Äîwhen Green Goblin uses her as a hostage and throws her off a building after learning that his true enemy has returned, Peter reflecting as he catches Anna Maria that he has learned over time to catch every joint in moments like this to limit potential whiplash.Superior Spider-Man #31 During the Civil War,Iron Man Captain America: Casualties of War both Iron Man and Captain America cited Gwen as argument for their opinions on the Superhuman Registration Act. Iron Man argued that if Spider- Man had received proper training as registered heroes were given, he would have saved her, while Captain America argued that Gwen was only in danger because the Goblin knew Spider-Man's identity, the Act requiring heroes to register their identities with the government. After Jane Foster becomes the new Valkyrie, she is reminded of how Spider-Man failed to save someone in a similar situation when she is forced to use her shape-shifting weapon to catch the fatally wounded Heimdall as he falls from a building after being attacked by Bullseye, and expresses concern that her actions have made Heimdall's wounds worse, but Heimdall gives no indication that he blames Jane for his death.Valkyrie: Jane Foster #2 =Attempted resurrection= As John Romita Sr. recalls, Stan Lee's initial reaction towards Gwen Stacy's death was negative because he thought that Romita, Conway and Thomas had done it behind his back and demanded them to bring her back immediately. Thomas and Romita along with everyone else within the editorial, however, convinced him otherwise, stating that they couldn't do that because it would be an \\"embarrassing silliness\\", aside that it could ruin the emotional impact caused by her death. While developing the story for the ultimately criticized Spider-Man: One More Day storyline along with Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott; Joe Quesada and J. Michael Straczynski made plans to resurrect Gwen Stacy along with Harry Osborn, who had been killed in The Spectacular Spider- Man #200. Numerous Marvel writers and editors, however, lobbied for Stacy to remain dead, forcing Quesada and Straczynski to discard their idea upon frustratingly realizing that they were outnumbered. Among the changes to continuity going as far back as 1971, Straczynski's original script had, as a consequence of Mephisto erasing Spider-Man's and Mary Jane's marriage from reality, Gwen Stacy being restored to life as her death never happened as well her affair with Norman Osborn. =What If?= In a non-canonical parallel universe story in What If? #24, Spider-Man saves Gwen by jumping after her rather than catching her with a web-line (in the same way he saved Mary Jane in the film), allowing him to cushion her from the impact as they hit the water and subsequently give her CPR. In the aftermath of this rescue, he proposed to Gwen after revealing his secret identity to her, and, in a subsequent confrontation with the Green Goblin, Norman Osborn finally fought off his evil side when Harry moved to protect him regardless of what he'd become. Their life, however, was not destined to be a happy one; to ensure his victory, the Goblin had sent J. Jonah Jameson proof of Spider-Man's real identity, which Jonah had subsequently published and used to acquire a warrant for Peter's arrest, thus forcing Peter to escape from the police mere moments after his wedding to Gwen. As the issue ended, Gwen departed with Joe \\"Robbie\\" Robertson, who promised Gwen that they would do whatever they could to help Peter. Reception Gwen's death shocked Spider-Man readers, with some appreciating the bold move and others horrified by the unexpected demise of a popular character. In Amazing Spider-Man #126 (Oct 1973), an editorial comment on the letters page explained the creators' view: Fans were not appeased by this explanation, and Romita says that Marvel received some death threats. In other media =Television= *\\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" was adapted in Spider-Man: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"Turning Point\\", the Green Goblin hurtled Mary Jane Watson off the bridge, but instead of dying, she falls through a portal, unseen to Peter Parker believing she has fallen and perished in the water below. The episode's name is the same as the main cover caption of the first issue in \\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" arc. *\\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" is somewhat reenacted in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon series. Instead of Gwen Stacy, other female characters that have a connection to Spider-Man are the Green Goblin's would-be victims: White Tiger (Ava Ayala) in the episode \\"Ultimate\\", and Spider-Girl (Petra Parker) in the episode \\"The Spider-Verse (Part 1)\\". =Films= *\\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" was adapted into the end of the 2002 Spider-Man film, with Mary Jane Watson again taking the role, although she did not die; Spider-Man managed to save her by jumping after her and catching her in person, subsequently battling the Green Goblin after lowering Mary Jane to safety, although Green Goblin dies similarly to how he did in the comics. *\\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" was loosely adapted in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Green Goblin- here Harry Osborn rather than Norman- drops Gwen Stacy through the top of a clock tower. Spider- Man saves her and knocks Green Goblin off of his glider. The glider hits into the clock tower gears that Gwen is standing on, and she falls. Spider-Man catches her again and she dangles below until the turning gears cut the web Gwen is hanging by. Spider-Man dives, shooting a web in the shape of a hand to catch her. She dies in a similar way to the comics. When the web catches her, she is literally just above the ground and a cracking sound is heard, leaving the exact cause of death ambiguous as there is an equal chance that she was killed by the sudden stop or because she slightly struck the ground. The clock stops at 1:21, a reference to the issue of the comic book in which Gwen died. *In the 2019 film Happy Death Day 2U, one of Tree Gelbman's deaths is modelled after Gwen Stacy's death as depicted in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

Le devoir de violence was initially well-received, but critics later charged that Ouologuem had plagiarized passages from Graham Greene and other established authors. Ouologuem turned away from the Western press as a result of the matter, and remained reclusive for the rest of his life. Life Yambo Ouologuem was born an only son in an aristocratic Malian family in 1940 in Bandiagara, the main city in the Dogon region of Mali (then a part of French Soudan). His father was a prominent landowner and school inspector. He learned several African languages and gained fluency in French, English, and Spanish. After matriculating at a Lyc√©e in the capital city of Bamako, he went to Paris in 1960, where he studied sociology, philosophy and English at Lyc√©e Henry IVBound to Violence - Yambo Ouologuem: Bio-Sketch & Review. ChickenBones: A Journal. and from 1964 to 1966 he taught at the Lyc√©e de Clarenton in suburban Paris, while studying for a doctorate in sociology at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. His major work, Le devoir de violence (1968), resulted in controversy and a continuing academic debate over charges of plagiarism. In 1969, he published out a volume of biting essays, Lettre √† la France n√®gre as well as an erotic novel, Les mille et une bibles du sexe, published under the pseudonym of Utto Rodolph. After the plagiarism controversy over Le devoir de violence, Ouologuem returned to Mali in the late seventies. Until 1984, he was the director of a youth centre in the small town of S√©var√© near Mopti in central Mali, where he wrote and edited a series of children's textbooks. He is reputed to have led a secluded Islamic life as a marabout until his death on 14 October 2017 in S√©var√©, aged 77. Le devoir de violence Le devoir de violence (published in English as Bound to Violence) was published in 1968 by Editions du Seuil. It was met with wide critical acclaim, winning the Prix Renaudot that very year, the first African author to do so. Ouologuem became a celebrity, and Le Monde called him one of \\"the rare intellectuals of international stature presented to the world by Black Africa\\", comparing him to Leopold Sedar Senghor. It was translated into English (Bound to Violence) by Ralph Manheim in 1971. Ouologuem's novel is harshly critical of African nationalism, and \\"reserves its greatest hostility for the violence Africans committed against other Africans\\".Amardeep Singh, \\"Richard Posner on Plagiarism; the Case of Yambo Ouologeum\\", January 9, 2007. Some critics felt that the praise and initial response of \\"authenticity\\" for the novel, which is often historically inaccurate, was a Western response. These critics viewed it as a rejection of a glorified view of African history: a review in The Nation said that Ouologuem had \\"shattered the ... myth of a glorious African past\\". However, the novel was soon mired in controversy, as some of its passages appeared to have been plagiarized from Graham Greene's It's a Battlefield and the French novel The Last of the Just (Le dernier des justes, 1959) by Andre Schwartz-Bart. After a lawsuit by Greene, the book was banned in France, and has only recently been re-published there. At the time, Ouologuem claimed that he had originally used quotations on some of the controversial passages, but his original manuscript is not available to verify this. He also claimed that in some early interviews, he had openly spoken of excerpting these passages, which is why it was not as controversial in France. Since 1977, the English edition has carried the note: \\"The Publishers acknowledge the use of certain passages on pages 54-56 from It's a Battlefield by Graham Greene.\\"Yambo Ouologuem edited by Christopher Wise, The Complete Review. Despite the controversy, the novel remains one of the landmarks of postcolonial African literature,Milet, Eric & Jean-Luc Manaud. Mali. Editions Olizane (2007). . (French). notable for its \\"cultural sweep: legends, myths, chronicles, religious matter woven into an opulent narrative; for eloquence: the cadence and music of the prose\\".Interview by Linda Kuehl, \\"Yambo Ouologuem: on Violence, Truth and Black History\\". ChickenBones: A Journal. Le devoir de violence delineates the seven-and-a-half centuries of history of central Mali (specifically, the Dogon region), from 1202 to 1947, when a fictitious nation, Nakem-Zuiko, is on the threshold of independence. The first part of the book deals with several powerful Malian empires, particularly the pre-colonial Toucouleur Empire which had Bandiagara as its capital, and the pre-Islamic Bambara Empire it replaced. It points out how African rulers collaborated with the slave traders, selling a hundred million citizens to be carried off into slavery. The narrative is marked by violence and eroticism, depicting sorcery and black magic as natural human activity. In the second, colonial part of the story, the protagonist, Raymond Spartacus Kassoumi, descended from slaves, is sent to France to be groomed for a political career. The story also highlights the process by which servility or \\"negraille\\" (a word coined by Ouologuem) is ingrained in the black population. Other writings Ouologuem's best-known works were republished in English and edited by Christopher Wise in The Yambo Ouologuem Reader: The Duty of Violence, A Black Ghostwriter's Letter to France and The Thousand and One Bibles of Sex (Africa World Press, 2008). His legacy is explored in a contemporary light in Yambo Ouologuem: Postcolonial Writer, Islamic Militant, a 1999 anthology, also edited by Wise, which includes an account of Wise's own attempt to find Ouologuem in Africa. Wise called \\"Ouologuem's decision to return to Mali and wash his hands of writing in French ... an incalculable loss to world literature.\\"Christopher Wise, Yambo Ouologuem: Postcolonial Writer, Islamic Militant, 1999, Lynne Rienner Publishers. Ouologuem also wrote poetry, some of which appeared in the journal Nouvelle Somme. He is anthologized in Poems of Black Africa (ed. Wole Soyinka, 1975) and The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry (ed. Gerald Moore and Ulli Beier, 1984). Influence Le devoir de violence has been defended by a number of critics including Kwame Anthony Appiah, who views it as a rejection of the \\"first generation of modern African novels ‚Äî the generation of Achebe's Things Fall Apart and Laye's L'Enfant noir\\".Richard Serrano, Against the Postcolonial: Francophone Writers at the Ends of the French Empire, Lexington Books, 2006, , p. 23. Jean-Fr√©d√©ric de Hasque's 2009 documentary O√π est l'Eldorado? (In Search of Eldorado) sporadically mentions Ouologuem's life and writings. The film focused on a group of Malian university students in S√©var√©, the town where he lived, all of whom were inspired by his work. Ouologuem himself did not appear in the documentary, as one town resident cautioned de Hasque against getting too close to the author's house while filming.

His businesses supplied residents, pioneers and others. Having made his fortune, he was able to retire at age 40, pursue his interest in botany, and used much of his fortune in philanthropy. He is best known as the founder of the Missouri Botanical Garden, but he also donated the land to the city for Tower Grove Park and oversaw its development. He donated funds to several other city institutions as well. Early life Shaw was born on July 24, 1800 in Sheffield, England, which had been a center of iron and steel manufacturing for centuries. Henry‚Äôs father, Joseph Shaw, had moved to Sheffield as a young man to open his own iron factory, along with a partner. The firm manufactured grates, fire irons and so forth. Henry was the oldest of four children in the family. He had two sisters, Sarah and Caroline, and a brother who died in infancy. Shaw received his primary school education in the village of Thone near his home in Sheffield. When he was about ten or eleven, he was transferred to the Mill Hill School near London. He studied at this boarding school for about six years, before returning home to Sheffield in 1816 or 1817. Shaw was taken out of school because of his father‚Äôs financial difficulties. While he had been away at school, his father‚Äôs business had come upon hard times. The family could no longer afford to send Henry to the expensive school with other children of the upper classes. But in his time at Mill Hill School, Shaw had gained the basic education of an English gentleman. He had studied the classics, learned some Latin and Greek, and studied French. He also studied mathematics and was introduced to the sciences. More importantly, he acquired the attitudes and outlook of an English gentleman, and a polish he would continue to have even after decades of life in the United States.  Business career  On his return to Sheffield, Shaw began to assist his father with the business. Searching for new markets, the elder Shaw turned his sights on the vast markets of the Americas. Iron and steel manufacturing in the former colonies was not as advanced as in England, and Sheffield steel products were some of the finest in the world. In 1818, Henry accompanied his father on his first trip across the Atlantic Ocean, where the pair did business in Quebec, Canada. Young Henry must have impressed his father with his business acumen because the next year he was sent to New Orleans alone on business. A shipment of goods to New Orleans had been lost or misplaced, and Shaw was sent to find the shipment. Although he recovered the goods, he could not find a buyer in New Orleans. With the business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit that was to mark his adult life, Shaw was determined to find a market for the goods in the interior of the country. Vast territories of the American Midwest had been opened up in the previous decade by the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. In about 1817, New Orleans had become the gateway to this area by the first steam-powered paddlewheel riverboat that made its way up the Mississippi River from the port of New Orleans. Henry Shaw's Tower Grove House, built in 1849. In the Spring of 1819, Henry Shaw purchased passage for himself and his goods on a steamship called the Maid of Orleans. The trip, which took 40 days, cost Shaw $120. On May 3, 1819, Shaw landed in a small French village on the west side of the Mississippi called St. Louis. At the time, the village was about fifty years old. It ran about three blocks deep for about a mile along the bank of the river. Shaw set up a hardware store in St. Louis, selling high quality cutlery and other metal products. His first storefront was at Four North Main, on the west side of the street between Market and Chestnut. The goods were purchased by Shaw‚Äôs uncle, James Hoole, in Sheffield and shipped to St. Louis. Hoole also provided the initial capital for the business. It turned out to be a good investment, as it was a good time to be in the hardware business in St. Louis. During the two decades Shaw operated his business, roughly 1819 to 1839, St. Louis grew quite rapidly. Shaw sold his goods to the people of St. Louis, to soldiers and farmers, and to the other new immigrants to the area. He also found a ready market in the pioneers making their way to the open lands of the West. Many of the pioneers moving westward were outfitted in St. Louis before moving West. Shaw carried the kind of hardware, tools and cutlery they would need to make the trip and set up a new homestead. As his business went well, he continued to buy land on the outskirts of the city. = Slave ownership = Missouri was a slave state, and Shaw acquired enslaved African Americans as workers by 1828 for his working farm land. He also had several slaves working as domestic servants. He owned as many as eleven slaves at a time. In June 2020, the Missouri Botanical Garden shared a Facebook post with the names of some of Shaw's slaves: Peach, Juliette, Bridgette, Joseph, Jim, Sarah, Tabitha and her daughter Sarah, Ester and her children. In 1855, four of Shaw‚Äôs slaves escaped but were caught as they crossed the Mississippi River. Esther and her children were trying to get to the free state of Illinois where they hoped to connect with helpers to travel further north on the Underground Railroad. Shaw consequently sold Esther south to Vicksburg, Mississippi, and separated her from her children. A census record reveals that Shaw had eight slaves in 1860. Retirement Henry Shaw mausoleum statue, Missouri Botanical Garden. By the age of 40, Shaw was one of the largest landholders in the city and was able to retire. This gave him the freedom to travel and to pursue his great interest in botany. Following his retirement, Shaw travelled extensively for years. He returned to St. Louis in 1851. He engaged architect George I. Barnett (who later also designed Shaw's mausoleum) to design and build Tower Grove House, which became the center of his estate. Working with leading botanists, Shaw planned, funded and built what would become the Missouri Botanical Garden on the land around his home. As the garden became more extensive, Shaw decided to open it to the general public in 1859. Shaw donated additional land adjoining the garden to the city of St. Louis for Tower Grove Park. He helped with its construction, including the pavilions and various works of art. He gave the city a school and land for a hospital. He endowed Washington University‚Äôs School of Botany, and helped found the Missouri Historical Society. Shaw died in 1889 and is buried in a mausoleum surrounded by a grove of trees on the grounds of the gardens he founded. He is widely remembered for his generosity and philanthropy. Over 100 years after his death, many who visit the Missouri Botanical Gardens still refer to it affectionately as \\"Shaw's Garden,\\" or \\"Hank's Garden.\\" For his philanthropic work, Shaw has been recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Artwork Section: Misa. 04-09-09 In 1983, the character Misa Hayase won the first Animage Grand Prix Award for \\"Best Female Character\\" in Japanese anime. Fictional character background According to the fictional Macross continuity, Misa Hayase is of Japanese ethnicity. She was born into a Japanese family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral Takashi Hayase. Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, Riber Fruhling, in the UN Spacy. However, this dream ended when Riber died during the destruction of the returning U.N. Spacy fleet from the Salla Mars Base (where he was stationed) by hostile Anti-U.N. terrorist forces (with a stolen U.N. Spacy space cruiser).Official Information of Riber's Death and the loss of all the Mars Base Salla Personnel After graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers' Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the SDF-1 Macross. Her rank was First Lieutenant at the beginning of the series. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer Claudia LaSalle became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. However, this mindset changed after she met the young pilot Hikaru Ichijyo, who at that time was in love with the soon-to-be superstar Lynn Minmay. The relationship between Misa and Hikaru slowly evolved throughout the series. In the beginning, Misa and Hikaru had a difficult superior-subordinate relationship, starting with Hikaru calling her \\"old woman\\" (obasan) when he saw her for the first time on his Valkyrie's screen, which, much to Misa's chagrin, resultsed in his senpai Roy Focker having a good laugh. However, the intensity of their relationship gradually softened after going through a series of crises and intimate moments together: Hikaru rescued Misa from the Mars base before the base exploded (Episode 7: Bye Bye Mars); they had their first \\"mission kiss\\" while demonstrating \\"Protoculture\\" to the Zentradi people (Episode 11: First Contact) and later managed to escape together (Episode 12: Big Escape); they accidentally shared an evening together while trapped in the transformed Macross and revealed to each other their respective lovelorn stories (Episode 21: Micro Cosmo). While they were still unsure of their own feelings, both felt deep loneliness after Misa departed Macross to Earth, trying to persuade the United Government to enter peace negotiations with the Zentradi troops. Clumsy at communicating his feelings, Hikaru sent Misa the message \\"Wish you return to Macross safely\\" using the Morse code (Episode 24: Goodbye, Girl). At the end of the Space War I, Hikaru ventured into the ruined Alaska base on Earth and rescued the sole survivor Misa. After their reunion, Hikaru told Misa that even though they were probably the only survivors on earth, he was happy as long as the partner was Misa (Episode 27: Love Flows By). After Space War I, the love triangle of Misa-Hikaru-Minmay underwent many turns and Misa was deeply hurt by Hikaru's lingering feeling for Lynn Minmay. However, Hikaru eventually realized that he could not live without Misa after the heartbroken Misa confessed her love for him while bidding farewell to him. The two got married on October 10, 2011 and their first daughter Ichijo Miku ‰∏ÄÊù°Êú™Êù• was born a year later.Best Hit Series: The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012 Graffiti. Y910. Shougakukan. Japan, 1987. In 2012, Misa and Hikaru were appointed as the Commander of the new SDF-2 Megaroad-01 ship and the Capitan of the ship's escorting Valkyrie group, inaugurating the space colonization chapter in the Macross history. In 2016, Megaroad-01 lost contact with Earth and Misa, Hikaru, Miku and the ship's crew and citizens (including Lynn Minmay, who remained as their friend and also boarded the ship) were declared missing. In the world of Macross Delta, signals were received from the long lost Megaroad-01. A mysterious \\"Lady M\\" („É¨„Éá„Ç£M Redi Emu) from Megaroad-01, whose identity was never revealed in the TV series, loomed large behind the scenes. What is known that this mysterious figure had been sponsoring researches on songs/Protoculture since Space War I, and eventually created the ultimate songtress Mikumo Guynemer. Given the grand vision, political influence, and competence of Lady M in dealing with the New United Government and initiating the researches, the most likely candidate is Misa, the Commander of Megaroad-01 and the one who deciphered the lyrics of the song \\"Do You Remember Love.\\" Additional notes on the character Misa Hayase as she appears in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012 Misa's character is the total opposite of the sweet, flighty, insecure Minmay. She's a strong-willed, determined and down-to-earth type of woman, completely immersed in doing her duty; at the same time, these traits had made her unable to maintain romantic relationships, although, as seen in the series, she lets her feelings interfere with her work. Misa's best friend is officer Claudia LaSalle, who knows Misa from their days at the military academy. She is her confidante and advisor in her personal life.Character of Macross: Claudia LaSalle.

According to an article in Animerica magazine, Shoji Kawamori's original idea for the Macross series was an all-female crew for the battleship with a female captain at the helm. After the idea was revamped for its final presentation, the female captain idea was reworked and became the template for Misa's character.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: The Making of Macross.

While the Macross-related film The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? tells a different take of events from the original series, Misa's character and relationship with Hikaru is portrayed in similar fashion as in the original. In the American re-working of the series that became known as Robotech her name was changed to Lisa Hayes and her ethnicity was changed to a Caucasian American. Legacy Catherine Glass of Macross Frontier physically resembles Misa Hayase, and is also shown to have trouble keeping up with a decent love life. Unlike Misa, Catherine and her love interest are supporting characters, rather than leading characters. Sheryl Nome from Macross Frontier also resembles Misa Hayase. Both of them are strong willed and down to earth women. In the manga adaptation of the series, there is a small tribute that has her wearing Misa's clothes (to match Ranka who wears Minmay's and Alto who is dressing as Hikaru).

The school was established on September 14, 1900, in Campbell, California. It is also sometimes called Campbell Union High School, and the abbreviation can be found both as CHS or CUHS. After 80 years, the school was closed in June 1980 due to declining enrollment at the school and within the district. The campus was purchased by the city of Campbell on August 1, 1985, and is now used as a community center. History Campbell Union High School opened its doors as part of the district in 1900, with a registration of 35 students, consisting of 23 girls and 12 boys. Two teachers were hired to educate the students: Professor E. A. Powers and Miss J. M. Newton. It was on the second floor of Campbell's Grammar School. The first graduating class was one student, Charles Beardsley, who went on to Stanford University and became a lawyer, thus proving Campbell Union High School's academic merit. By 1904, Principal Fred Smith had gotten the school moved to a new (bigger) building on the southeast corner of Winchester and Campbell Avenues. In 1936, they built again, on the northwest corner of the same intersection, where the buildings still are today. In 1938, the auditorium of the Campbell Union High School was built, with Work Projects Administration funds and the design of William H. Weeks. It is now commonly known as the Heritage Theater. Over the course of its forty years as part of the school, it is estimated that 20,000 students performed there. Larry Hill, (a.k.a. Laurance J. Hill), Campbell's principal beginning in 1946, and a superintendent of the Campbell Union High School District until 1969, is credited with much of the district's growth and planning in his years in office. An award in his name is given out every year at each high school in the district. Campbell High School, although the namesake school of the district, was closed in 1980, because of declining enrollment in the area and in the district. Prospect, Westmont and Del Mar High School's attendance boundaries subsequently expanded to pick up the slack. On August 1, 1985, after some negotiating, the city of Campbell purchased the campus, including the historic Heritage Theater, and it became the Campbell Community Center. The Heritage Theater, formerly the high school's auditorium, was reopened as the Campbell Community Center after renovations in 2004. Many local performance groups, including high schools in the CUHSD, rent the Heritage for various noteworthy performances. The rest of the Community Center holds classes, and portions are available to be rented for various purposes, including large meeting halls, office space, and outdoor facilities. =National Register listing= The campus' three buildings, as the Campbell Union High School Historic District, were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrost's Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as \\"a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You never really know who is going to sing or what will happen next, and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements.\\" Reception In Case We Die appeared on the ARIA Albums Chart Top 100. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, the album received three nominations: 'Best Independent Release', 'Best Cover Art' (by Bird) and 'Best Adult Contemporary Release'. The song \\"It'5!\\" (pronounced \\"it's five\\") received airplay on the national radio network Triple J and was listed No. 56 in their Hottest 100 for 2005. The album received generally favourable reviews according to Metacritic website's rating of 72 out of 100 based on reviews by 26 professional critics. AllMusic's Heather Phares found the music was \\"much more assured\\" than their debut album, Fingers Crossed (2003), with \\"lots of parts and changes to them\\" but it \\"never feels ponderous\\" containing \\"vibrant, irresistible, Technicolor music\\". Tiny Mix Tapes writer S. Kobak was unsure \\"whether Architecture in Helsinki is for real or an ironic parody of the post-Arcade Fire indie rock scene\\" as \\"[the album] sounds like a cross between Off the Wall-era Michael Jackson without the soul, the Banana Splits, the Grease soundtrack and shitty disco records\\". Laurence Station at ShakingThrough.net noted the group \\"progresses dramatically in ambition and proficiency\\" and likened their style to a \\"Jackson Pollock drip painting, chaotic and bustling\\" with \\"swirling, colorful melodic kaleidoscope works. Rhythmic continuity is so over\\".

It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. History The Kansas State High School Activities Association was formed in 1937 and incorporated in 1956. As early as 1910, Kansas schools organized the statewide Debate League and Athletic Association governed by high school principals. The Athletic Association started as a small voluntary group of fewer than 50 schools and grew to more than 500 schools by the 1920s. Out of necessity, the member schools adopted eligibility and participation rules and established authority for a Board of Control to assess penalties against schools for violations. In 1927 the Board of Control employed the first full- time Executive Secretary. To date, six individuals have served as Executive Director. Classification KSHSAA divides schools based upon enrollment of grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 for competition and state and regional championships. The largest 32 schools in the state are class 6A, the next largest 32 become 5A, the next 64 become 4A, 3A, and 2A respectively and the remaining schools become class 1A. These classes are re-evaluated every year for all activities except football, with new classifications announced in September after the start of the school year. Ninth grade students were not counted toward the annual classification totals from 1967-68 through 2010-11. In 2013, the 64 schools in class 4A voted to split into two divisions for volleyball, baseball, basketball, softball, and football. Starting with the 2018-19 school year, Classes 6A, 5A and 4A will consist of 36 schools each. Classes 3A and 2A will continue to have 64 schools each, while the remaining schools will be in 1A. The two-division format which currently exists in 1A for basketball, scholars bowl and volleyball, and in 4A for baseball, basketball, softball and volleyball, will be eliminated. Football is evaluated biannually based only upon enrollment for grades 9, 10, and 11, with classifications for the next two seasons announced in October of an odd-numbered year. Schools with 100 or fewer students in grades 9-11 have the option to play Eight-man football instead of the traditional 11-man game. In 11-man football, there are five classes (6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2-1A), with 32 schools in 6A and 5A, 64 schools in 4A and 3A, and the remaining schools (43 for 2010 and 2011; 41 for 2012 and 2013) in 2-1A. In eight-man football, there are two divisions of roughly equal size, with 105 schools scheduled to compete in 8-man for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, decreasing to 104 for 2012 and 2013 due to consolidation in many rural towns. Beginning in 2018, Classes 6A, 5A and 4A will have 32 schools in each classification for football, with the two-division format in 4A eliminated. Classes 3A and 2A will have 48 schools each, and Class 1A will have the remaining 11-man football playing schools (31 in 2018 and 2019). 8-man Division I will be limited to 48 schools, with the remainder in 8-man Division II. The KSHSAA did not sponsor state championship playoffs for football until 1969. District play was introduced to determine playoff participants in 1981. From 1981 through 2001, only district champions advanced to the playoffs. In 2002, the top two teams in each 11-man district began to qualify for the playoffs; district runners-up were added to the playoff brackets for 8-man in 2004. In 2016, districts were abolished in Classes 5A and 6A. In those classifications, teams now schedule the first eight games on their own, with the ninth week acting as the first week of the playoffs. Teams are seeded onto the bracket based upon overall record and divided into two groups of 16 based upon geography. The same format will be used in Class 4A beginning in 2018. Schools form leagues to compete against one another, and participation in a particular league is voluntary. Most schools in a league are located within a close geographic range. The most notable example is in Wichita, where the nine high schools within the city limits form the Greater Wichita Athletic League (GWAL, more commonly known as the City League). However, due to sparse population in western Kansas, schools in the same league are often separated by distances of more than 100 miles, and in a few cases, schools are almost 200 miles apart. In some sports and activities where not all small schools may field a team, classifications are combined for purposes of state championships. For example, in policy debate, there are state championships for 6A, 5A, 4A, and 3-2-1A combined. =Historical classifications= Basketball: * 2019: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A * 2014 to 2018: 6A, 5A, 4A-Division I, 4A-Division II, 3A, 2A, 1A-Division I, 1A-Division II * 2011 to 2013: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A-Division I, 1A-Division II * 1969 to 2010: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A * 1952 to 1968: AA, A, BB, B * 1941 to 1951: AA, A, B * 1931 to 1940: A, B Football: * 2018 to 2019: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A, 8-man Division I, 8-man Division II * 2014 to 2017: 6A, 5A, 4A-Division I, 4A-Division II, 3A, 2-1A, 8 Man-Division I, 8 Man-Division II * 1985 to 2013: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2-1A, 8 Man- Division I, 8 Man-Division II * 1983 to 1984: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A, 8 Man- Division I, 8 Man-Division II * 1978 to 1982: 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A, 8 Man * 1969 to 1977: 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, 1A, 8 Man Events The association's largest event is the Kansas State track and field championships, which are held the weekend before Memorial Day at Cessna Stadium on the campus of Wichita State University. The meet, which features athletes from schools in all six classes, is one of the nation's largest high school meet, with more than 3,300 athletes participating. The state track meet hosted its 100th competition in 2010. Former GWAL Athletic Director and current Assistant Superintendent of Wichita Public Schools, Bill Faflick holds the position of Meet Director and has been widely praised for his direction of the meet. The eight-man football championships are held the Saturday before Thanksgiving, while the 11-man football title games are held the Saturday after Thanksgiving, ensuring the football season ends before December 1. The games are held at various sites across the state, with popular sites including Fort Hays State University in Hays, Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas, the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas State University in Manhattan, Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, and Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, as well as high school stadiums in Salina and Topeka. The eight-man championships are currently held at Fischer Field in Newton. Kansas is one of the few states, especially in the Midwest, that holds state football championship games at different sites. State championships in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin are held at a single central location. Missouri holds its title games at two sites over two separate weekends. The state basketball championships are held the second week of March, with girls and boys competition taking place at the same time. The sites for the six classes remained constant from 1990 through 2010, with 6A at Wichita State, 5A at the Kansas Expocenter in Topeka, 4A at the Bicentennial Center in Salina, 3A at the Hutchinson Sports Arena, 2A at Bramlage Coliseum on the KSU campus, and 1A at Fort Hays State's Gross Memorial Coliseum. The 4A, 3A and 1A tournaments began at their current locations in 1980. In 2011, the 6A tournament moved to Charles Koch Arena on the campus of Wichita State University, with Emporia taking over the Class 1A-Division I tournament. The 1A-Division II tournament remained at Hays. State championships for baseball and softball are held at the same time as the track championship, usually at community colleges or large recreational fields, although some championships have been held at Lawrence‚ÄìDumont Stadium in Wichita, home of the National Baseball Congress tournament and the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball's Wichita Wingnuts, as well as Hoglund Ballpark at KU in Lawrence. The 2011 Class 6A tournament was hosted by KU, and the 5A tournament was hosted by Wichita State at Eck Stadium. State championships for wrestling are held in late February every year. Up until 2005, classes 6,5, and 4A held separate but concurrently running tournaments at the Kansas Coliseum in Wichita, Kansas, while 3-2-1A held their tournament at Gross Memorial Coliseum in Hays. After that year, KSHSAA began looking for alternative sites for the classes to hold their tournaments for a number of reasons, including remodeling which was to begin on the Coliseum in the following years. In 2006, 4A left 5A and 6A and held its own tournament at the Bicentennial Center in Salina, Kansas, while the other classes stayed at their respective sites. In the 2007-08 season, each of the 4 classes competed in 4 separate facilities, as the Coliseum was not be available. 3-2-1A and 4A remained in Hays and Salina respectively, while 6A moved to Charles Koch Arena at Wichita State University and 5A moved to Hutchinson High School. The 2009 6A and 5A championships returned to the Kansas Coliseum, but only for a one- year contract. The 2010 5A and 6A state wrestling tournaments were held at the Intrust Bank Arena. The 2011 6A and 5A state championships were moved to the Hartman Arena in Park City, Kansas, and will continue there in 2012. Due to Kansas's cold climate in the winter, the championships for golf, tennis, and soccer are split. Girls compete in golf and tennis in the fall and soccer in the spring, while boys compete in soccer in the fall and golf and tennis in the spring. Boys' golf teams may compete in grass green (traditional) or sand green competition. Girls who attend schools without golf, tennis, and soccer teams are allowed to play on the boys' teams at the school. Sanctioned activities KSHSAA classifies its activities into athletic and non-athletic events. ; Non-Athletic Events * Policy Debate * Kansas Association for Youth * Music * Piano * Scholar's Bowl * Speech & Drama * Spirit Activities * Student Council ; Athletic Events * Baseball * Bowling * Basketball * Cross Country * Football * Golf * Girls Gymnastics * Soccer * Softball * Swimming & Diving * Tennis * Track & Field * Girls Volleyball * Wrestling Criticism KSHSAA has been criticized for its 6A-1A format. Similar sized states, including neighboring Missouri do not have as many classifications, but have more total schools. This over-classification has been deemed a \\"watered down effect\\". Many rural schools argue the current classification structure favors schools in larger cities, especially in Classes 5A and 4A, where the discrepancy between the classification numbers is quite large. For the 2008-09 school year, the largest Class 4A school had more than 2.5 times the number of students as the smallest school in the classification. It has been suggested by many Kansas High School supporters (most specifically in basketball) that 5A and 6A should combine to form one 64 team classification. Other plans call for the 16 biggest 5A schools to jump to 6A. The idea is opposed by schools in the state's three major metropolitan areas (Kansas City, Topeka and Wichita), since the vast majority of 5A and 6A schools are in those areas. Of the 32 Class 6A schools, 13 are located in Johnson County, the state's most populous county with approximately 17 percent of Kansas's population.

The nearest major towns are Bathgate, and Livingston, . History Originally a small farming & weaving community centred around the burn that runs through, it was once a district of Linlithgow until 1973 and a parish of Livingston until 1730 when it established into its own as the population began to rise. When reliable statistics began with the Statistical Accounts of Scotland the population was counted at 1,322 in 1755 followed by a more accurately count of 1,322 in 1795. Whitburn has appeared on maps since the 17th century of the Early Modern period and appears on a manuscript authored by Scottish map maker John Adair in 1680. The earliest documented reference to Whitburn is dated 26 September 1363 and can be found in the Index of Charters by King David II of Scotland. It grants William de Carnys and his heir Duncan a concession to the terms upon which they held the baronies of Easter and Wester Whitburn. There were also two gold pieces of Roman coin discovered in a field in 1845 but there is no other evidence of Roman occupation. During the Age of Enlightenment the community was trading cotton, pig iron and coal. \\"Old quarries\\" can be seen dotted over the area on the Ordnance Survey 1st Edition map, presumably from the days of clay, sandstone and iron ore extraction. The majority of farmers rented agricultural land because of the Lowland Clearances and most of it was owned by Esquires. Between the 18th and 20th century the town was dominated by mines with the largest being Polkemmet Colliery ‚Äì a large coal mine, discovered in the town in the late 1800s ‚Äì but this was closed in the 1980s as a result of damage by underground flooding during the 1984-85 miners' strike and never re-opened. The colliery buildings have gone, and the coal bings that once were prominent have now been removed. Work to dismantle Bing No 3, the infamous burning bing, started in August 2006 and was completed by February 2008. The last major outbreak of burning occurred in 1998. As of 2017 the bings have been flattened and it is now a large housing estate as a result from the Heartlands Project. There was a Scottish Police College located on the current site of Townhead Gardens in the 1940s, before it moved to the old mansion at Polkemmet. Whitburn Council Offices The town's population was boosted by the 1960s Glasgow overflow. The town's Murraysgate and surrounding areas north-west of the cross were established to deal with the overflow. Schools The town has 5 primary schools, 4 of which have nurseries within. These five schools are known as Croftmalloch Primary School, Polkemmet Primary School, Burnhouse, St Joseph's Primary School and Whitdale Primary School. Whilst four of the schools are non denominational, St Joseph's is regarded as a Catholic school. Burnhouse school is for children with behavioural difficulties who cannot be placed in mainstream schools. The local secondary school is Whitburn Academy. It is a state run non-denominational secondary school serving pupils aged 11 to 18. Its catchment area is the town of Whitburn and the surrounding villages of Fauldhouse, Longridge, East Whitburn, Stoneyburn, and Greenrigg. There are approximately 1000 pupils at the school. Sport and recreation Whitburn has a King George's Field in memory of King George V which was opened in 1955 by Queen Elizabeth II. On 16 January 2012, a planning application was submitted regarding the rebuild of the swimming pool; drawings of the new facility were posted on the Xcite Leisure Website. Whitburn is home to Whitburn Junior F.C. who play at Central Park and are in the SJFA East Region Super League. In 2000 they won the OVD Scottish Juniors Cup. The town holds its annual gala day on the third Saturday in June; there is a parade through the town, followed by games and races at King George V Park. The gala day is part of a week of activities known as the \\"Civic Week\\"; this also includes a fairground and a fireworks display in King George V Park. Polkemmet Country Park is located to the west of the town, and incorporates woodland, a golf course, cafe, and play area. The park is also locally famous for the Polkemmet Horn which can be seen from the M8 motorway which runs to the north of the country park. There is also a disused steam locomotive from Polkemmet Colliery on display. Since 2012 Polkemmet Park has also been the site of the Scottish Owl Centre. Industry The town was once the site of Levi Strauss & Co., the clothing manufacturer. The plant opened in 1969, employing a work force of over 500 local people. At its height, the plant was producing 4 million pairs of jeans in a year. The plant shut its doors in December 1999. Bands The Whitburn Band is a brass band formed in 1870. The band has been successful on the contest stage and competes at the British Open, National Final and European Championships, and has been Scottish Champion on 19 occasions. In 2017, the Whitburn Band was ranked 6th in the world in the 4barsrest rankings. Whitburn Flute Band was formed in the town in 1962, although it is thought the band may have existed in some form before this. The band host their annual parade through the town on the first Saturday in April. The parade attracts bands from all over the UK who come to compete.

The federally recognized Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians acquired a majority interest in the Greektown Casino, the third of these to open. Steelman Partners were the architects and interior designers for the original project. The Sault Chippewa Indians have a base at their reservation lands near Sault Ste.

In June 2006, site preparation began for a new hotel related to the casino. A city-owned parking garage was demolished to make way for redevelopment. Construction began in October 2006 and finished in 2009. The hotel tower rises 344 ft. (105 m.) with 30 floors. It opened November 15, 2007, and included a new 13-story, 3,500-space, free parking garage at Monroe and St. Antoine.

In February 2016, Rock Gaming (which had rebranded as Jack Entertainment) announced that it was renaming the casino as \\"Jack Detroit Casino-Hotel Greektown\\". But plans for the name change were canceled in March 2018, after Gilbert agreed to sell the casino for $1 billion.

When it opened in 1959 it was the first caf√© in the Square. The owner, Josefina Yanguas, claimed the caf√© had the first espresso-maker in the city. Down a short flight of exterior stairs, past a patio with tables, customers entered the caf√©'s subterranean interior. The once austere decor included bright yellow lights which made the thickly-plastered walls glow under low ceilings, and a black and white checked floor. The caf√© survived the changes that had taken place since the mid-1980s. History Josefina Yanguas, who arrived in America in 1947, roughly modelled the caf√© after those of her native Pamplona, Spain. From 1959The Harvard Crimson :: Continental Cafe until her death in 2007,The Harvard Crimson :: News :: Beloved Pamplona Owner Dies at 90 Yanguas was the only owner of the caf√©. Shortly after the caf√© opened Yanguas and her Cuban chef Juana Rodr√≠guez began preparing and serving food. As business grew Yanguas began to hire only men, in accord with the usual Spanish practice of having a single-sex staff, until 1999.

The APS was created by the separation of the Protective Service component of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) into a new agency based upon recommendations contained in the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking.Australian Parliament House website p.1. Accessed on 14 July 2008 It was initially responsible for protecting personnel and property of the Australian government; foreign diplomatic missions and Internationally Protected Persons (IPPs); and the provision of custodial services at immigration detention centres. From 1990 the APS commenced providing Counter Terrorist First Response duties at certain security-designated airports including the specialist Bomb Appraisal Officer function and, following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, deployed Air Security Officers (ASOs - often referred to as 'sky marshals') on board Australian registered commercial aircraft. Close Personal Protection (CPP), or bodyguard, functions were never provided by the APS; where this has been a Commonwealth responsibility, the function is provided by the AFP. The staff and functions of the APS were reintegrated into the AFP in 2004 as part of Australian Government efforts to better coordinate the response to terrorism.Australian Parliament House website Accessed on 14 July 2008 History Pre 2004 APS Patrol car The Australian Protective Service (APS) was established in 1984 when 420 Constables transferred from the Australian Federal Police. The APS followed a tradition dating back through its predecessors the Protective Service component of the Australian Federal Police, the uniformed branch of the former Commonwealth Police and the former Peace Officer Guard. What follows is a brief history of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement and Security Service which led up to the inception of the Australian Protective Service (APS). Australia's first Commonwealth Police Force was short lived - surviving only two years between December 1917 and 1919 being set up following an altercation between the then Prime Minister of Australia, William Morris (Billie) Hughes and a heckler at a rally in Queensland after local police sergeant declined to become involved 'in a Federal matter'. In later years discussions between Commonwealth government and state authorities resulted in the birth of the Commonwealth Investigation Service - a plainclothes unit with the responsibility of conducting investigations into specific breaches of Commonwealth legislation. The early 1930s saw the formation of the Peace Officer Guard with the aim of protecting Commonwealth property and interests. The Peace Officer Guard (POG) operated at such establishments as munitions factories, research facilities and certain Commonwealth Government departments. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) came into existence in 1949, absorbing some of the functions of the Commonwealth Investigations Service and assuming new areas of responsibilities. The Commonwealth Police was re-formed in 1960, absorbing both Peace Officer Guards and Commonwealth Investigations Service officers. In 1975 the most ambitious plan to restructure Australia's national police service was attempted by the Commonwealth Government. An amalgamation of Commonwealth Police, Northern Territory Police and Australian Capital Territory Police forces, Department of Customs and Excise and Special Reports Branch of the Department of Immigration would have produced the \\"Australia Police\\". However, the amalgamation was abandoned later the same year following a change of Government. The bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) on 13 February 1978 prompted the Federal Government to commission an inquiry into Australia's national police service by former London Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Robert Mark. As a consequence of this inquiry, on 19 October 1979, the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Police Forces were amalgamated to form the Australian Federal Police which, shortly after, was expanded to assume the functions of the former Narcotics Section of the Bureau of Customs. The Australian Federal Police was initially established as a two component force, with General Policing and Protective components. As previously mentioned, prior to 1960, Federal Law Enforcement was carried out by two organisations, the Commonwealth Investigative Service and Peace Officer Guard. The primary function of the Protective Service Component of the AFP was to continue the duties which were originally laid down for the POG. On 14 December 1983 the federal government decided that the Protective Service Component of the AFP should be abolished and a separate, dedicated protective security service established. Subsequently the Australian Federal Police (Amendment) Act 1984 was passed by Federal Parliament and came into force on 19 October 1984. This resulted in the abolition of the Protective Service Component and on day one (20 October 1984) the establishment of the Australian Protective Service within the Department of Administrative Services with the transfer of 420 Constables under Section 9f of the Public Service Act. The first Director of the APS was Peter Dawson, previously an Assistant Secretary of the Purchasing Division within the Department of Administrative Services. The Australian Protective Service was the Commonwealth Government's specialist custodial, protective security and Counter Terrorist law enforcement agency. Plain clothed operations were normally restricted to members of the NSW Region Escort Response Group (ERG) and the more recently introduced Air Security Officers (Sky Marshals). However, Protective Service members in locations such as Darwin deployed regularly in the mid to late 90s to escort Immigration detainees, usually in civilian attire to blend in on domestic aircraft. The APS was responsible for the protection of property in which the Commonwealth, a foreign country or an international organisation had an interest, persons holding office under the Commonwealth, their families and internationally protected persons. The APS also operated some functions in the contestable private sector area. With the sale of Australian airport facilities the APS contracted for the provision of Counter Terrorism First Response (CTFR) role to the airport operators. AFP Uniformed Protection patrol car (2007) Unlike other law enforcement agencies the APS had limited internal honours and awards, the most coveted being the Australian Protective Service Directors Award conferred by the APS Director as the head of the Agency. Following the September 11 terror attacks the Commonwealth Government conducted a review of counter terrorism arrangements. As a result it was decided to combine the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the APS in order to ensure the closest possible co-ordination between two of Australia's key counter terrorist agencies. The Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 was introduced into Parliament with the intention of making the Australian Protective Service (APS) an operating division of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The merger occurred on 1 July 2004 when the Australian Protective Service, with 1327 employees, became an operating division of AFP. Present Protective Service Officers (PSOs) are still employed within the AFP. Their primary functions remain the protection of selected sensitive sites across Australia including Parliament House, the residences of the Governor General and Prime Minister, foreign embassies and consulates, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) facilities at Lucas Heights NSW and certain Defence facilities. PSOs, whilst not sworn police, have powers of arrest under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 for specific Commonwealth offences. Roles and functions Some of the key roles undertaken by the APS included: * High level security at the residences of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia * Protection of Parliament House, and the Office of the Prime Minister * Protection of foreign embassies and consulate offices within Australia (such as the United States Diplomatic mission to Australia) * Protection of sensitive defence establishments, including Defence Headquarters at Russell Offices in Canberra; the joint Australian/US communications facility at Pine Gap in the Northern Territory; the former atomic testing site at Maralinga in South Australia; the Australian Defence Signals facility at Geraldton and the naval communications station at Exmouth, both in Western Australia * Protection of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) at Lucas Heights and other sensitive nuclear storage facilities. * Perform security and escort protection for Commonwealth VIPs. * Conduct protective security risk reviews for other Commonwealth agencies, and broader organisations dealing with Commonwealth interests. * Security and escorting of sensitive and/or high value items in which the Commonwealth Government had an interest. * Security and later also fire alarm monitoring for Commonwealth agencies and other entities. * Deployment of Air Security Officers (ASOs) aboard Australian-registered commercial passenger aircraft. * Augmentation of security at other facilities or for designated operations, including during protest activity at immigration detention centres and as part of the security arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2001. In 2007, the APEC Summit hosted in various Australian states and cities including Sydney had AFP Protective Service Officer involvement regarding enforcement and protection as world leaders including John Howard, George W. Bush and other government and economic leaders were in attendance. The Air Security Officer program In response to the 11 September incidents, the Commonwealth instituted an Air Security Officer (ASO) Program under the APS. These employees were generally referred to in the media as Sky Marshals. The ASO Programme provided a discreet anti-hijacking capability for Australian civil aviation by providing armed security personnel on board aircraft. This involves both random and intelligence-led placement of armed ASOs on flights operated by Australian registered air carriers, including domestic and international flights into and out of Australia. The program drew from a pool of applicants that included Defence Force personnel and employees of State Police Forces and the AFP, all of whom were sworn as PSOs for the AFP. Peacekeeping A reflection of the AFP's international obligations is its peacekeeping role. The AFP's peacekeeping efforts are principally focused on the Pacific where the organisation assists in the law-enforcing efforts of many sovereign nations. As such, AFP Protective Service Officers are routinely deployed overseas to assist with peacekeeping operations in the Solomon Islands. Protective Service Officers were deployed along with other Australian law enforcement officers in the Solomon Islands as part of RAMSI. The peacekeeping force suffered their first casualty on 22 December 2004 when PSO1 Adam Dunning was shot and killed while deployed on official duties in the Solomon Islands. Two former members of a local militia were charged but acquitted of Dunning's murder. Officer Dunning was buried with full police honours. The main street of a new AFP International Training Village in Canberra was named Adam Dunning Drive in his memory. The $2.8 million training facility at Majura (Google Maps -35.250362, 149.207547) just outside Canberra, has been designed to replicate situations in regional countries to which personnel might be assigned.

His music provides a link among old-time Southern music, minstrelsy, jazz, and Western swing. Life Miller was born on February 2, 1900 in Macon, Georgia. His early life is largely undocumented, but it generally is acknowledged that he was performing in minstrel shows by the time he was in his early 20s. His first recordings were released by Okeh Records in 1924. His backup group, the Georgia Crackers, included in the 1930s the noted jazz musicians Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, and Eddie Lang. Miller continued to perform in minstrel shows until he was well into his 50s, long after they had fallen out of fashion. He returned to Macon, where he died in 1962.

Living systems are robust to mutations. This means that living systems accumulate genetic variation without the variation having a phenotypic effect. But when the system is disturbed (perhaps by stress), robustness breaks down, and the variation has phenotypic effects and is subject to the full force of natural selection. An evolutionary capacitor is a molecular switch mechanism that can \\"toggle\\" genetic variation between hidden and revealed states. If some subset of newly revealed variation is adaptive, it becomes fixed by genetic assimilation. After that, the rest of variation, most of which is presumably deleterious, can be switched off, leaving the population with a newly evolved advantageous trait, but no long- term handicap. For evolutionary capacitance to increase evolvability in this way, the switching rate should not be faster than the timescale of genetic assimilation. This mechanism would allow for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. Switching rates may be a function of stress, making genetic variation more likely to affect the phenotype at times when it is most likely to be useful for adaptation. In addition, strongly deleterious variation may be purged while in a partially cryptic state, so cryptic variation that remains is more likely to be adaptive than random mutations are. Capacitance can help cross \\"valleys\\" in the fitness landscape, where a combination of two mutations would be beneficial, even though each is deleterious on its own. There is currently no consensus about the extent to which capacitance might contribute to evolution in natural populations. The possibility of evolutionary capacitance is considered to be part of the extended evolutionary synthesis. Switches that turn robustness to phenotypic rather than genetic variation on and off do not fit the capacitance analogy, as their presence does not cause variation to accumulate over time. They have instead been called phenotypic stabilizers. Enzyme promiscuity In addition to their native reaction, many enzymes perform side reactions. Similarly, binding proteins may spend some proportion of their time bound to off-target proteins. These reactions or interactions may be of no consequence to current fitness but under altered conditions, may provide the starting point for adaptive evolution. For example, several mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene B-lactamase introduce cefotaxime resistance but do not affect ampicillin resistance. In populations exposed only to ampicillin, such mutations may be present in a minority of members since there is not fitness cost (i.e. are within the neutral network). This represents cryptic genetic variation since if the population is newly exposed to cefotaxime, the minority members will exhibit some resistance. Chaperones Chaperones assist in protein folding. The need to fold proteins correctly is a big restriction on the evolution of protein sequences. It has been proposed that the presence of chaperones may, by providing additional robustness to errors in folding, allow the exploration of a larger set of genotypes. When chaperones are overworked at times of environmental stress, this may \\"switch on\\" previously cryptic genetic variation. =Hsp90= The hypothesis that chaperones can act as evolutionary capacitors is closely associated with the heat shock protein Hsp90. When Hsp90 is downregulated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a broad range of different phenotypes are seen, where the identity of the phenotype depends on the genetic background. This was thought to prove that the new phenotypes depended on pre-existing cryptic genetic variation that had merely been revealed. More recent evidence suggests that these data might be explained by new mutations caused by the reactivation of formally dormant transposable elements. However, this finding regarding transposable elements may be dependent on the strong nature of the Hsp90 knockdown used in that experiment. =GroEL= The overproduction of GroEL in Escherichia coli increases mutational robustness. This can increase evolvability. Yeast prion [PSI+] Sup35p is a yeast protein involved in recognising stop codons and causing translation to stop correctly at the ends of proteins. Sup35p comes in a normal form ([psi-]) and a prion form ([PSI+]). When [PSI+] is present, this depletes the amount of normal Sup35p available. As a result, the rate of errors in which translation continues beyond a stop codon increases from about 0.3% to about 1%. This can lead to different growth rates, and sometimes different morphologies, in matched [PSI+] and [psi-] strains in a variety of stressful environments. Sometimes the [PSI+] strain grows faster, sometimes [psi-]: this depends on the genetic background of the strain, suggesting that [PSI+] taps into pre-existing cryptic genetic variation. Mathematical models suggest that [PSI+] may have evolved, as an evolutionary capacitor, to promote evolvability. [PSI+] appears more frequently in response to environmental stress. In yeast, more stop codon disappearances are in-frame, mimicking the effects of [PSI+], than would be expected from mutation bias or than are observed in other taxa that do not form the [PSI+] prion. These observations are compatible with [PSI+] acting as an evolutionary capacitor in the wild. Similar transient increases in error rates can evolve emergently in the absence of a \\"widget\\" like [PSI+]. The primary advantage of a [PSI+]-like widget is to facilitate the subsequent evolution of lower error rates once genetic assimilation has occurred. Gene knockouts Evolutionary capacitance may also be a general feature of complex gene networks, and can be seen in simulations of gene knockouts. A screen of all gene knockouts in yeast found that many act as phenotypic stabilizers. Knocking out a regulatory protein such as a chromatin regulator may lead to more effective capacitance than knocking out a metabolic enzyme. Facultative sex Recessive mutations can be thought of as cryptic when they are present overwhelmingly in heterozygotes rather than homozygotes. Facultative sex that takes the form of selfing can act as an evolutionary capacitor in a primarily asexual population by creating homozygotes. Facultative sex that takes the form of outcrossing can act as an evolutionary capacitor by breaking up allele combinations with phenotypic effects that normally cancel out.

Multiple access is achieved in OFDMA by assigning subsets of subcarriers to individual users. This allows simultaneous low-data-rate transmission from several users.  Key points  The advantages and disadvantages summarized below are further discussed in the Characteristics and principles of operation section. See also the list of OFDM key features. = Claimed advantages over OFDM with time-domain statistical multiplexing = * Allows simultaneous low-data-rate transmission from several users. * Pulsed carrier can be avoided. * Lower maximal transmission power for low-data-rate users. * Shorter delay and constant delay. * Contention-based multiple access (collision avoidance) is simplified. * Further improves OFDM robustness to fading and interference. * Combat narrow-band interference. = Claimed OFDMA advantages = * Flexibility of deployment across various frequency bands with little needed modification to the air interface. * Averaging interferences from neighbouring cells, by using different basic carrier permutations between users in different cells. * Interferences within the cell are averaged by using allocation with cyclic permutations. * Enables single-frequency network coverage, where coverage problem exists and gives excellent coverage. * Offers frequency diversity by spreading the carriers all over the used spectrum. * Allows per-channel or per-subchannel power. = Recognised disadvantages of OFDMA = * Higher sensitivity to frequency offsets and phase noise. * Asynchronous data communication services such as web access are characterised by short communication bursts at high data rate. Few users in a base station cell are transferring data simultaneously at low constant data rate. * The complex OFDM electronics, including the FFT algorithm and forward error correction, are constantly active independent of the data rate, which is inefficient from power-consumption point of view, while OFDM combined with data packet scheduling may allow FFT algorithm to hibernate during certain time intervals. * The OFDM diversity gain and resistance to frequency- selective fading may partly be lost if very few sub-carriers are assigned to each user, and if the same carrier is used in every OFDM symbol. Adaptive sub- carrier assignment based on fast feedback information about the channel, or sub-carrier frequency hopping, is therefore desirable. * Dealing with co- channel interference from nearby cells is more complex in OFDM than in CDMA. It would require dynamic channel allocation with advanced coordination among adjacent base stations. * The fast channel feedback information and adaptive sub-carrier assignment is more complex than CDMA fast power control.  Characteristics and principles of operation  Based on feedback information about the channel conditions, adaptive user-to-subcarrier assignment can be achieved. If the assignment is done sufficiently fast, this further improves the OFDM robustness to fast fading and narrow-band cochannel interference, and makes it possible to achieve even better system spectral efficiency. Different numbers of sub-carriers can be assigned to different users, in view to support differentiated Quality of Service (QoS), i.e. to control the data rate and error probability individually for each user. OFDMA can be seen as an alternative to combining OFDM with time-division multiple access (TDMA) or time-domain statistical multiplexing communication. Low-data-rate users can send continuously with low transmission power instead of using a \\"pulsed\\" high-power carrier. Constant delay, and shorter delay, can be achieved. OFDMA can also be described as a combination of frequency-domain and time-domain multiple access, where the resources are partitioned in the time‚Äìfrequency space, and slots are assigned along the OFDM symbol index, as well as OFDM sub-carrier index. OFDMA is considered as highly suitable for broadband wireless networks, due to advantages including scalability and use of multiple antennas (MIMO)-friendliness, and ability to take advantage of channel frequency selectivity. In spectrum sensing cognitive radio, OFDMA is a possible approach to filling free radio frequency bands adaptively. Timo A. Weiss and Friedrich K. Jondral of the University of Karlsruhe proposed a spectrum pooling system in which free bands sensed by nodes were immediately filled by OFDMA subbands.  Usage  OFDMA is used in: * the mobility mode of the IEEE 802.16 Wireless MAN standard, commonly referred to as WiMAX, * the wireless LAN (WLAN) standard IEEE 802.11ax, * the IEEE 802.20 mobile Wireless MAN standard, commonly referred to as MBWA, * MoCA 2.0, * the downlink of the 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) fourth-generation mobile broadband standard.

Executives involved in restructuring often hire financial and legal advisors to assist in the transaction details and negotiation. It may also be done by a new CEO hired specifically to make the difficult and controversial decisions required to save or reposition the company. It generally involves financing debt, selling portions of the company to investors, and reorganizing or reducing operations. The basic nature of restructuring is a zero-sum game. Strategic restructuring reduces financial losses, simultaneously reducing tensions between debt and equity holders to facilitate a prompt resolution of a distressed situation. Corporate debt restructuring is the reorganization of companies‚Äô outstanding liabilities. It is generally a mechanism used by companies which are facing difficulties in repaying their debts. In the process of restructuring, the credit obligations are spread out over longer duration with smaller payments. This allows company's ability to meet debt obligations. Also, as part of process, some creditors may agree to exchange debt for some portion of equity. It is based on the principle that restructuring facilities available to companies in a timely and transparent matter goes a long way in ensuring their viability which is sometimes threatened by internal and external factors. This process tries to resolve the difficulties faced by the corporate sector and enables them to become viable again. Steps: *Ensure the company has enough liquidity to operate during implementation of a complete restructuring *Produce accurate working capital forecasts *Provide open and clear lines of communication with creditors who mostly control the company's ability to raise financing *Update detailed business plan and considerations  Valuations in restructuring In corporate restructuring, valuations are used as negotiating tools and more than third-party reviews designed for litigation avoidance. This distinction between negotiation and process is a difference between financial restructuring and corporate finance. From the point of view of transfer pricing requirements, restructuring may entail the need to pay the so-called exit fee (exit charge). Restructuring in Europe =The \\"London Approach\\"= Historically, European banks handled non-investment grade lending and capital structures that were fairly straightforward. Nicknamed the \\"London Approach\\" in the UK, restructurings focused on avoiding debt write-offs rather than providing distressed companies with an appropriately sized balance sheet. This approach became impractical in the 1990s with private equity increasing demand for highly leveraged capital structures that created the market in high-yield and mezzanine debt. Increased volume of distressed debt drew in hedge funds and credit derivatives deepened the market‚Äîtrends outside the control of both the regulator and the leading commercial banks. Characteristics *Cash management and cash generation during crisis *Impaired Loan Advisory Services (ILAS) *Retention of corporate management in the form of \\"stay bonus\\" payments or equity grants *Sale of underutilized assets, such as patents or brands *Outsourcing of operations such as payroll and technical support to a more efficient third party *Moving of operations such as manufacturing to lower-cost locations *Reorganization of functions such as sales, marketing, and distribution *Renegotiation of labor contracts to reduce overhead *Refinancing of corporate debt to reduce interest payments *A major public relations campaign to reposition the company with consumers *Forfeiture of all or part of the ownership share by pre-restructuring stock holders (if the remainder represents only a fraction of the original firm, it is termed a stub) *Improving the efficiency and productivity through new investments, R&D; and business engineering. Results A company that has been restructured effectively will theoretically be leaner, more efficient, better organized, and better focused on its core business with a revised strategic and financial plan. If the restructured company was a leverage acquisition, the parent company will likely resell it at a profit if the restructuring has proven successful.

Today, Mair√©ad is recognised as a leading exponent in the Donegal fiddle style, and she is often considered as one of the foremost singers in the Irish language, her native tongue. She was part of the Irish supergroup T with the Maggies who performed in January 2009 at Temple Bar TradFest in Dublin their first ever two concerts under that name and who released in October 2010 their debut (and to date only) album. After nearly 22 years with Altan, Mair√©ad released in February 2009 her debut solo album Imeall. After 29 years with Altan, Mair√©ad released in October 2016 her alternate band Na Mooneys' debut album Na Mooneys. Background N√≠ Mhaonaigh grew up in Gweedore, County Donegal, on the northwest coast of Ireland. Her father, Proinsias √ì Maonaigh, who got married in 1954, taught her to play the fiddle. She received tuition from fiddler Dinny McLaughlin, who was a frequent visitor to the home when she was young. Ciar√°n Tourish, who would later join Altan, was also a frequent visitor to the family home and also received tuition from McLaughlin.Robinson N√≠ Mhaonaigh has two siblings: *Her brother Gear√≥id √ì Maonaigh was an executive in an office for long years, played guitar for Ragairne (a short-lived band formed by N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Frankie Kennedy, of which singer Enya was a member), appeared on the album Ceol Aduaidh, and organised the Frankie Kennedy Winter School. *Her younger sister Anna N√≠ Mhaonaigh was going from job to job, mostly in film and being PA to various TV projects, has contributed backing vocals to several albums and was a member of the (all female) group Macalla.O'Regan She met Frankie Kennedy at a session at age 15. Kennedy was inspired to learn to play and soon became a talented flute player. They married in 1981. Career = The early 1980s: Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh & Frankie Kennedy duo, Ragairne = RT√â television in the 1980s. One evening, during a session in Gweedore (County Donegal), fifteen-year-old fiddle player Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, daughter of the session's leader Proinsias √ì Maonaigh, met with Belfast-born eighteen-year-old Frankie Kennedy during his summer trip to the Gaeltacht. They were attracted to each other, and Kennedy wrote to her regularly after leaving Donegal. Kennedy was advised by a friend that he should learn an instrument if he intended to court N√≠ Mhaonaigh, and so he got a whistle and taught himself to play. Later he learned the flute, a somewhat louder instrument, so that he could hear himself in sessions. His love for N√≠ Mhaonaigh coupled with perfectionist tendencies turned him into a well-respected flute player. Kennedy and N√≠ Mhaonaigh married in 1981. The new couple continued to play at sessions in Donegal, and this formed the basis for their musical partnership. They made their recording debut on Albert Fry's eponymous record in 1979 and later formed a short-lived group called Ragairne which also included Gear√≥id √ì Maonaigh, N√≠ Mhaonaigh's brother, on guitar, Donal O'Hanlon from Newry on guitar, vocals and cittern and was rejoined in 1981 by singer Eithne N√≠ Bhraon√°in, later known as Enya. Joined by bouzouki player Ciar√°n Curran and Eithne N√≠ Bhraon√°in, now known as Enya, on synthesizer, Frankie Kennedy and Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh released a recording entitled Ceol Aduaidh on Gael-Linn records in 1983. At the time, Kennedy and N√≠ Mhaonaigh were earning their living by teaching at St. Oliver Plunkett National School in Malahide, north County Dublin. But live performances in 1984 and 1985, particularly in the United States, convinced them that there was an audience for \\"no-compromise traditional music played with heart and drive,\\" and they were persuaded to give up teaching. During this time, the group added guitarist Mark Kelly and released in 1987 a record called Altan, named after a lake in Donegal, although the name Altan wasn't used for the band on that release. Altan was produced by D√≥nal Lunny, who subsequently appeared as either a producer or guest musician on every Altan album which followed. =1987‚Äìpresent: Altan= Forsaking their jobs as teachers, N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Kennedy formed the band Altan during the late 1980s. Kennedy's death from cancer in 1994 put the band's future in question, but she decided to continue at Kennedy's explicit request. As well as her work with Altan, N√≠ Mhaonaigh over the years has presented traditional music programmes on radio and television, including the radio show, The Long Note and the television series, The Pure Drop. =2005‚Äìpresent: String Sisters= N√≠ Mhaonaigh is a member of the fiddle ensemble String Sisters active as a band since 2005. =2007‚Äìpresent: T with the Maggies= N√≠ Mhaonaigh along with friends Moya Brennan, Maighread N√≠ Dhomhnaill and Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill came together as T with the Maggies in 2007, and released their debut album T with the Maggies in October 2010. =2007‚Äìpresent: Solo work & solo live performances= Mair√©ad performing with her father. In 2007/08, N√≠ Mhaonaigh recorded Imeall, her debut (studio) album in the home studio of her friend and musician/co-producer Manus Lunny in T√≠r Chonaill, County Donegal, Ireland. On 28 December 2008, at the Frankie Kennedy Winter Music School in Gweedore, N√≠ Mhaonaigh premiered live some songs from the album in an intimate concert with Lunny. For this occasion, she also released a small number of copies of the album. On 12 February 2009, the album was officially launched in Dublin and released worldwide. Only 3000 physical copies were pressed and made available worldwide from her website. The title is Irish for 'Edge' or 'Threshold' and the album features traditional/folk songs as well as new compositions by N√≠ Mhaonaigh. N√≠ Mhaonaigh previously performed two special concerts in January 2008 at the Temple Bar TradFest with long-time friends Moya Brennan, Maighread N√≠ Dhomhnaill and Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill. It was the second time the four musicians ever performed together. It was also the first time N√≠ Mhaonaigh performed live some songs from her then yet-to-be (worldwide) released solo album Imeall. For the occasion, she was joined by special guests who spent the last few years recording with her. Since February 2009, N√≠ Mhaonaigh (fiddle, lead vocals) has toured solo and (mostly) as a trio with Manus Lunny (bouzouki) & James Higgins (percussions). She has also guested a few times with other musicians such as French flutist Sylvain Barou (in June 2013 in Calais, France and in April 2014 in L'√éle-d'Yeu, France) and French violinist Didier Lockwood (also in June 2013 in Calais). Mair√©ad also contributed a track, M√° Th√©id T√∫ Chun Aonaigh to the Irish charitable album Ceol Cheann Dubhrann which was released in December 2009 to raise funds for two projects in Ranafast, a Gaeltacht area from which Mair√©ad has collected songs. Mair√©ad performed live on 28 January 2018 at Rathfarnham Castle, Dublin, Ireland. Along with her daughter Nia Byrne and her long-time fellow friend, neighbour and producer Manus Lunny, she performed live (before a backstage audience) a (39:50) set of tunes and songs on 3 October 2020 at the Cork Opera as part of the Cork Folk Festival. The live performance was filmed and the stream video was made available through the Cork Folk Festival Facebook page.Cork Folk Festival Facebook page > \\"Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh & Manus Lunny {& Nia Byrne} Beo √≥n Cork Opera House mar chuid don Cork Folk Festival\\" (= \\"Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh & Manus Lunny {& Nia Byrne} Live from Cork Opera House as part of the Cork Folk Festival\\") (3 October 2020) =2013‚Äìpresent: Na Mooneys= On 7 January 2016, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh announced on her Facebook page that the new band called Na Mooneys that she had formed (along with her nephew Ciar√°n √ì Maonaigh and her siblings Anna N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Gear√≥id √ì Maonaigh) two years earlier (during the last Frankie Kennedy Winter School where they performed their first ever show) were in the process of recording their debut family album.

The band were formed by former Ride guitarist Andy Bell, along with vocalist / guitarist Alex Lowe, bassist Will Pepper and drummer Gareth \\"Gaz\\" Farmer. After releasing two albums, Hurricane #1 (1997) and Only the Strongest Will Survive (1999), the band broke-up. Bell went to join Gay Dad and then eventually Oasis, while Lowe ventured into a solo career. Fronted by Lowe, the band reformed in 2014 and released their third album, Find What You Love and Let It Kill You, in November 2015. History =Formation, Hurricane No. 1 and Only the Strongest Will Survive (1996‚Äì99)= Wishing to perform the later-day sound of his former band Ride, vocalist/guitarist Andy Bell formed Hurricane No. 1.Molanphy 1998, p. 40 Signed to Creation Records (along with fellow bands such as Oasis, The Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream) they released their debut album in 1997, entitled Hurricane #1. This included their first single, \\"Step into My World\\", which reached number 29 in the UK Singles Chart (and a Paul Oakenfold remix of which reached number 19 in 1997),Roberts 2006, p. 264 and other less successful singles \\"Just Another Illusion\\" and \\"Chain Reaction\\". In 1999, follow-up album Only the Strongest Will Survive spawned the band's other highest charting single, also called \\"Only the Strongest Will Survive\\". The song reached number 19 in 1998. =Break up (1999‚Äì2014)= In 1999, Bell parted ways with Hurricane No. 1, joining Oasis on Bass. Shortly after joining Gay Dad, Bell split from the band to become the bass player for Oasis. In 2004, a double disc compilation of their songs was released, entitled Step into My World. Former Hurricane No. 1 vocalist / guitarist, Lowe has pursued a solo career, and has released three albums to date. In 2007, Lowe announced a new project called Garage Flowers, and a single, \\"Where To Begin\\", was released via iTunes. In 2013, Lowe formed his project band called Gun Club Cemetery, and already released the self-titled debut album in the same year. =Reformation (2014‚Äìpresent)= In November 2014, it was announced that Hurricane No. 1 had reunited without Bell, Farmer, and Pepper.

Lowe wrote the album while he was undergoing treatment for cancer in hospital. Lowe explained that \\"When you are wired up to chemo and radio therapy, the last thing you want to do is wallow in it and feel sorry for yourself so I had the idea that the album should be happy and not too dark.\\" Melodic Rainbows, the band's fourth album, was released on 12 October 2016 in Japan. The album will be released in the UK in November 2017. The band are set to play Beano on the Sea festival in September and the Shiine On Weekender in November.

Formation Half Life Half Death was originally formed in 1988 by five High school students of Sta. Clara Parish School in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines. Style Half Life Half Death inevitably derived its musical style from its main influences, mostly new wave and post-punk British bands which became popular in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila, during the members' highschool days, in the 1980s; bands that included The Cure, Depeche Mode, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Lotus Eaters, The Smiths, and The Wild Swans. Although, there was also a subtle influence of Progressive Rock (Rush, Yes, ELP) in the structures and instrumentation of their music, heard best on the song \\"Radio Madness\\"; as well as of many Alternative Rock bands that included Violent Femmes, The Dead Milkmen, The Lemonheads, Dinosaur Jr., Radiohead, and even Filipino bands particularly The Dawn, Identity Crisis, and Eraserheads. These influences may be heard in the style of the songs in their lone album. Many Filipino Alternative-music enthusiasts fondly remember Half Life Half Death for its quirky remake of \\"High School (Life),\\" an '80s Pop song written by the Filipino composer George Canseco for the Filipina actress/singer Sharon Cuneta. Half Life Half Death's version of the song was a concert favorite among the underground-music crowd of the late 1980s. It eventually achieved commercial popularity when the band recorded it for a compilation album released in 1995 by Vicor Records. The song enjoyed heavy airplay on various FM radio stations, further helping Half Life Half Death gain some more following and land a record deal with Viva Records. Half Life Half Death attained commercial popularity among Filipino Alternative Rock enthusiasts when their independently recorded single \\"Alimango\\" became #1, in 1994, on the now-defunct FM radio station DWLA 105.9, which promoted unsigned Filipino Rock bands. This achievement paved the way to the band's inclusion in four compilation albums: \\"Kapit-Tuk√¥\\" for A Dozen Alternatives (1994, Viva Records), \\"Sa Paskong Darating\\" for Christmas on the Rocks (1994, Viva Records), \\"High School (Life)\\" for Mga Himig Natin Volume 2 (1994, Vicor Records), and \\"Nosi Ba Lasi? (Lala's mix)\\" for the original soundtrack of the movie Okey si Ma'am (1995, Viva Records). In 1995, Half Life Half Death finally recorded and released its debut album, Pymyth Prahn, under Viva Records. Despite the commercial quality and the lush concept of the album, the band failed to achieve commercial status and soon disbanded; with the members concentrating on each of their actual professions. The album spawned a few cult favorites that included \\"Butterflies,\\" \\"Brother's Pen,\\" and \\"We Are the Saints\\"; but \\"High School (Life)\\" remained their most popular song. Half Life Half Death reformed and resumed activity in 2000 especially at Mayric's, a long-running club which served as a breeding ground for many important Filipino Rock bands which include Alamid, Sugar Hiccup, and The Youth. The band also began arranging new materials for a possible second album; but the plans were shelved when its vocalist went to Canada in 2003. However, before finally wrapping up a 15-year obscure career, Half Life Half Death released an independently produced double-CD compilation of all recorded materials plus a few demos, entitled The Halven Trilogy, the third part of which the band intends to finish and release on their vocalist's return to the Philippines. Fans of the band regard Half Life Half Death as \\"The Cure of the Philippines,\\" chiefly because of their strong and honest reference to their new wave roots and certainly for the uncompromising Curesque style of their vocalist, whose sense of fashion virtually never changed from day one through the band's demise in 2003. Recent Updates Late 2005 saw interesting musically related developments concerning Half Life Half Death key members Alfie Vera Mella, Rainald Paggao and Ramil Aznar, each of whom has embarked on a new musical project of his own. In 2012, bandleader Mella's plan to visit the Philippines pushed through after nearly nine years, finally reuniting the key members of the band to perform a number of successful gigs at some of the old venues where the band used to play at during their heyday in the 1990s, culminating with a grand reunion show held at Club Phi, in Pasig City, Metro Manila. =haLf man haLf eLf / Half Endangered Species / The Half Gifts= aLfie vera mella, now based in Canada, formed a performing band aptly named haLf man haLf eLf. In December 2006, mella in collaboration with fellow Winnipeg-based Filipino musician Abelardo \\"Ardie\\" Sarao\\" released an EP entitled The Woes of Emong Payaso (independent label: eLf ideas / Kalabasa Records). This carried the single \\"Parang karnabal--ganyan ang buhay ng tao.\\" During live performances, haLf man haLf eLf was initially comprised by mella and a backup of friend musicians who included Roy Gutierrez (guitars), Jason Paredes (bass), Roberto \\"Abet\\" Carino (bass), Cris Pangan (bass), Joshua Bernardo (drums), Paul \\"Ten-ten\\" Labao (drums), Edward Daquina (drums), and Jimmy Tan (lead guitars). A few of the group's significant performances included serving as one of the front acts for Philippine-based Rock bands doing a Canadian tour, like Siakol (in May 2006) and Mike Hanopol (in 2007). In July 2007, mella, again in collaboration with Sarao, begins recording a new song, entitled \\"Like Fireflies (You Are My Only Hope).\\" In October 2008, the duo along with musicians Joseph David (drummer), Nicco Gilbang (bassist), and Danny Omana (keyboardist) formed Half Endangered Species and performed as one of the front acts of the Filipino Nu Metal band Slapshock in the Winnipeg leg of their 2008 Canadian tour. In February 2009, mella and David form a new band with friends Aldo Caziani (guitars), Sherwin Ylagan (bass), and Benjo Mendoza (keyboards), calling themselves The Half Gifts. They immediately begin arranging songs for a planned three-song CD that they hope to release within the next few months. The planned EP, entitled A Melange of..., which would have contained \\"Vanilla Float,\\" \\"Chocolate Mousse,\\" and \\"Cotton Candy Carnival,\\" has been shelved. Due to conflict in schedules and priorities of members, The Half Gifts dissolved in the middle of 2009. Mella reverts to using the name haLf man haLf eLf, as he is joined by mostly new members. The band was one of the front acts to the Winnipeg concert of the Filipino Alternative Rock band Pupil. The reinvigorated haLf man haLf eLf began to perform in venues outside the Filipino community such as Mona Lisa Ristorante Italiano, Paragon Lounge & Restaurant, Ozzy's Bar at Osborne Village Motor Inn, Dylan O'Connor's Irish Pub on Portage Avenue, and Curtis Hotel Henderson Drafthouse on Henderson Highway. The band's lineup in the early 2010s were aLfie vera mella (vocals, keyboards, bellkit, percussion), Christine Mazur (violin, cello, acoustic guitar, vocals), Robert Nicanor Jr. (drumkit, percussion), Dave Labovich (mandolin, banjo), and Janice Bamsworth (cajon). Previous members included Robert \\"Jun\\" Villanueva Jr. (12-string acoustic guitar, percussion), Tyler Holmes (keyboards), Johnny Holmes (bass), Jan Castillo (ukulele), Pol Chua (acoustic bass), and Dante Gomez (electric guitar). haLf man haLf eLf brands its style of music as Classical New Wave‚Äîa mix of the melodious sensibilities of New Wave and Postpunk and the intricate instrumentation and arrangement of Classical. Mella as haLf man haLf eLf remains loyal to the style for which his erstwhile band Half Life Half Death was known‚ÄîNew Wave with a touch of the technical instrumentation of Classical music and Progressive rock and the \\"fist-raised\\" attitude of old-school Punk Rock. Songs that haLf man haLf eLf had covered during gigs included \\"Just like Heaven\\" (The Cure); \\"I Melt with You\\" (Modern English); \\"The One I Love\\" (R.E.M.); \\"Today\\" (The Smashing Pumpkins); \\"More to Lose\\" (Seona Dancing); \\"High School (Life),\\" \\"Butterflies,\\" and \\"Brother's Pen\\" (Half Life Half Death); \\"Susi\\" (The Dawn); \\"Nagpapapansin, Pansinin\\" (Urban Bandits), and \\"Canto de Maria Clara\\" (The Camerawalls). Currently comprised by the core of mella, Mazur, Labovich, Xaq Freeman (acoustic guitar), and Jeremy Rusu (12-string acoustic guitar, accordion, acoustic bass), haLf man haLf eLf is yet to finish recording its debut album to be titled Tales from a Half Forgotten Era. =The Rain / Half Moon Half Rain= Based in the Philippines, Rainald Paggao collaborated with his brother, JB, and formed The Rain, releasing its first album, entitled Girl in Mind (2006, independent label). The two cover songs featured in the album, The Psychedelic Furs' \\"The Ghost in You\\" and Seona Dancing's \\"More to Lose,\\" are a reference to the duo's New Wave roots. The Rain's music is reminiscent of classic '80s Alternative Rock / New Wave bands the likes of The Cutting Crew, The Railway Children, and Flesh for Lulu. Prior to involving himself on this project, Paggao also became the lead guitarist of Dream Kitchen, another Filipino Alternative Rock band. He is also currently the lead guitarist of Dead Popstars, a Filipino New Wave band which many Alternative-music enthusiasts regard as \\"the ultimate The Smiths tribute band of the Philippines.\\" In October 2007, Paggao and his brother begin working on their second album, entitled The Emperor's New Songs. In the same year, mella and Paggao pursue a long-distance collaboration. Using the project name Half Moon Half Rain, the two was able to finish two songs: \\"My Brilliant Friend,\\" a reworking of an old unreleased original song written by mella when he was still with Dream Kitchen; and a version of Seona Dancing's \\"More to Lose.\\" =Dream Kitchen (Mark II)= Also based in the Philippines, Ramil Aznar is now the front person (vocalist/guitarist) of Dream Kitchen's reincarnation, whose current members include Dream Kitchen originators Aldrin Cardona (guitars), Gilbert \\"Bebet\\" Tiongson (drummer), and Vincent \\"Bong\\" Torres (bass), the first two of whom also became members of Half Life Half Death during its final days. Dream Kitchen's first commercial release, \\"16 Hours,\\" can be found in the compilation album entitled 8 Track (2005). The band's music takes on the sound of Alternative rock / Britpop bands such as Radiohead, This Perfect Day, and Weezer. Dream Kitchen's professionally produced music video of \\"16 Hours\\" was nominated for the \\"Music Video of the Year\\" category in the 2006 MTV Philippines Music Awards. Dream Kitchen has recently finished recording a 10-song demo album and is currently scouting for a record label that would sign them. In the late '90s, during Dream Kitchen's early days and Half Life Half Death's inactivity, mella served as Dream Kitchen's vocalist and occasional keyboardist. Significant songs covered by the band during this period included \\"Say Something\\" (James), \\"Blushing Girl, Nervous Smile\\" (The Wallflowers), \\"Bring On the Dancing Horses\\" (Echo & the Bunnymen), \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (New Order), \\"Waterfall\\" (Riverside), \\"True Fools Fall\\" (Died Pretty), \\"The Worst Year of My Life\\" (The Wild Swans), \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" (Band-aid), \\"Falling\\" (Under Blue Skies), and \\"Sumigaw, Umawit Ka\\" (Identity Crisis). Original songs composed by Dream Kitchen at the time, but which did not see the light of being released commercially, included \\"Vanilla Float,\\" \\"The Neverending Why,\\" \\"Silver Spoon on My Mouth,\\" \\"For Her Brilliance,\\" \\"My Chocolate Mousse,\\" and \\"Buhay-Karnabal,\\" which reincarnated as haLf man haLf eLf's \\"Parang karnabal--ganyan ang buhay ng tao.\\" Before their eventual disbandment in 1999, Dream Kitchen with mella recorded five original songs at Purple Studios in Manila, Metro Manila, Philippines. In 2004, this set of compositions was compiled by mella into an EP entitled half baked delicacies (\\"Vanilla Float,\\" \\"The Neverending Why,\\" \\"Silver Spoon on My Mouth,\\" \\"For Her Brilliance,\\" and \\"Buhay-Karnabal\\"). =The Halven Story= Vocalist aLfie vera mella released a 4-CD epic package in December 2006, in conjunction with the culmination of his debut album as haLf man haLf eLf. The package included a newly enhanced and redesigned The Halven Trilogy music of Half Life Half Death (commercially released songs and previously unreleased studio recordings) and a redesigned Girl in Mind of The Rain (retitled as Songs for Moonlit Nights, which included a version of Seona Dancing's \\"More to Lose,\\" showcasing a long-distance collaboration of Paggao [who rendered the guitar tracks in the Philippines] and mella [who recorded the vocal and keyboard tracks in Canada]). Part Three of the trilogy, half buried treasures, is yet to be finished; this will feature previously unreleased studio recordings of Half Life Half Death, remixes of studio-recorded songs of Dream Kitchen, remixes of some songs from The Rain album, and alternate versions of haLf man haLf eLf's \\"Parang karnabal--ganyan ang buhay ng tao.\\" The Halves =Original members= *aLfie vera mella (vocals, sound effects, bellkit, percussion), 1988‚Äì2003, 2012 *Rainald \\"Rain\\" C.

Most of his writings deal with sea, adventures, and love.The Soviet Union, A Biographical Dictionary, Macmillan, NY, 1990.  Biography  Aleksandr Grin was born Aleksandr Stepanovich Grinevsky () in a suburb of Vyatka in 1880, the son of the Pole Stefan Hryniewski (russianized as Stefan Grinevsky), deported after the January Uprising of 1863, and a Russian nurse Anna Lyapkova.Alexei Varlamov (2010). Aleksandr Grin. Biography. Moscow: Eksmo, 544 pages. In 1896, after graduating from a school in Vyatka, Grinevsky went to Odessa and lived the life of a vagabond. He worked as a sailor, gold miner, construction worker, but often found himself without a job and sustained himself by begging and thanks to money sent to him by his father. After joining the Russian army, he became a member of the Socialist- Revolutionary Party, was arrested, and spent time in jail for \\"revolutionary propaganda\\". His first short story was published in a newspaper in 1906. In the same year he was arrested in Saint Petersburg and sentenced to four years of exile in a remote area of Tobolsk Governorate. However, very soon after arriving to Tobolsk, Grin escaped and returned to Petersburg to live illegally. He was again arrested in 1910 and sent to live in Arkhangelsk Governorate. In a small village called Kegostrov, Grin and his first wife Vera Pavlovna Abramova (whom he married in 1910) lived from 1910 to 1912. In 1912, he returned to Saint Petersburg and divorced his wife. At that time, Grin published mostly short stories; most of his larger works were written after the October revolution and enjoyed significant popularity in the first half of the 1920s. In 1921, he married . In 1924, they moved to Feodosiya to live near the sea. In his late days, Grin's romantic visions were in stark conflict with the mainstream Soviet literature; publishers in Moscow and Leningrad refused to consider his romantic writings, and Grin and his wife lived in extreme poverty. Grin suffered from alcoholism and tuberculosis which eventually ruined his health. He died of stomach cancer in 1932 in Stary Krym. In his book Sculpting in Time, filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky describes how Grin, when dying of hunger, \\"went off into the mountains with a home-made bow and arrow to shoot some sort of game.\\" He offers Grin as an example of a poet in the deepest sense: one with \\"an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality... a philosophy to guide a man throughout his life.\\"Andrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1967) p.21  Works  Scarlet Sails\\" celebrations in Saint Petersburg named after Alexander Grin's novel Most of Alexander Grin's writings bear no direct relation to the reality of Imperial and Soviet Russia that he lived in. The setting of most of his novels and short stories is an unnamed land by the sea, apparently far from Europe but with all characters being Western European in name and appearance. Even his literary pseudonym (Grin) is a de-Russified form of his real last name (Grinevsky). Described by some critics as \\"adolescent fiction\\",Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives, Sandra L. Beckett Grin's works have many things in common with the reality of the early 20th century (such as automobiles and banks). Populated by sea captains, sailors, scientists, travelers, criminals, extravagant aristocrats, childlike girls, elegant villains, and strong-spirited heroes who always stay true to their dreams, Grin's world is often referred to as Grinlandia by fans. Some of his novels contain an element of magic ‚Äì not as an established part of his world, but always as a miracle that changes the lives of those who encounter it. Bibliography The most notable of his novels include: * Scarlet Sails (–ê–ª—ã–µ –ø–∞—Ä—É—Å–∞, 1923), a simple but powerful love story, perhaps the most famous of Grin's works.

Life  Born in F√ºrth, Wassermann was the son of a shopkeeper and lost his mother at an early age. He showed literary interest early and published various pieces in small newspapers. Because his father was reluctant to support his literary ambitions, he began a short-lived apprenticeship with a businessman in Vienna after graduation. He completed his military service in W√ºrzburg. Afterward, he stayed in southern Germany and in Zurich. In 1894 he moved to Munich. Here he worked as a secretary and later as a copy editor at the paper Simplicissimus. Around this time he also became acquainted with other writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Thomas Mann. In 1896 he released his first novel, Melusine (his surname means \\"water-man\\" in German, while a \\"Melusine\\" (or \\"Melusina\\") is a figure of European legends and folklore, a feminine spirit of fresh waters in sacred springs and rivers). From 1898 he was a theater critic in Vienna. In 1901 he married Julie Speyer, whom he divorced in 1915. Three years later he was married again to Marta Karlweis. After 1906, he alternated between Vienna and Altaussee in Styria. In 1926, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts. He resigned in 1933, narrowly avoiding expulsion by the Nazis. In the same year, his books were banned in Germany owing to his Jewish ancestry. He died on 1 January 1934 at his home in Altaussee of a heart attack. Wassermann's work includes poetry, essays, novels, and short stories. His most important works are considered the novel The Maurizius Case (Der Fall Maurizius, 1928) and the autobiography, My Life as German and Jew (Mein Weg als Deutscher und Jude, 1921), in which he discussed the tense relationship between his German and Jewish identities.Scharfstein S: Jewish History and You.

Distribution was handled by American Multiple Industries until distribution changed to Game Source. Players control two nude women; the goal is to catch semen in their mouths, which is falling from a masturbating man on a rooftop, without missing. Its gameplay has been compared to the Atari game Kaboom!. There is also a gender-reversed version of the game titled Philly Flasher that features identical gameplay. Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em has received negative reviews since its release and is an oft-cited example of pornographic Atari 2600 games.  Gameplay  Players control two nude women on the street who must catch semen in their mouths that comes from a masturbating man on a rooftop without missing. This can be accomplished merely by semen touching the women's bodies before it hits the ground. A more difficult setting requires players to catch the semen before it goes past the women's shoulders. If the player successfully catches all the semen in one round, the two women lick their lips and the game progresses to the next round. If any semen hits the ground, the first turn is over. Players are allowed to miss four times before the game is over. They can gain a turn every 69 points scored (up to two extra turns). Players move both women using the controller's paddle and the game allows each player to control one woman. The game plays similarly to the Atari game Kaboom!. Philly Flasher is a gender swapped version of the game in which the player controls two male prisoners with their genitals exposed catching lactation from an old witch's breast. Instead of licking their lips, the two men will masturbate if the player successfully catches every drop of lactate. Release Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em was published and developed by Mystique in 1982. Its sales and distribution were handled by American Multiple Industries. A gender-reversed version of the game was later released in a 'double-ended' cartridge along with Cathouse Blues as Philly Flasher, in which the player is tasked with controlling two male prisoners with visibly erect penises as they attempt to catch drops of breast milk lactated by a witch. All gameplay mechanics are identical to the original, save for the fact that when the men catch all the milk, they masturbate and ejaculate. The rights for sales and distribution were taken over by Game Source, which changed the line of adult video games (which included Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em) to \\"PlayAround\\". The company created multiple \\"double-ender\\" cartridges which included two of these adult games in one. One of these was a compilation of Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em and Lady in Wading. A homebrew port of the game for the NES was developed in 2014 by FG Software. Reception Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em has received negative reviews since its release. It is often cited as an example of pornographic Atari 2600 games. The developer had received criticism for this game. Atari HQ identified both the Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em and the PlayAround cartridge a rarity level of 5 out of 10. Allgame gave it two stars out of five. Seanbaby included it in his list of the 10 naughtiest games of all time; he mocked a quote in the manual that chastises players who fail to catch sperm as the sperm \\"could have been a famous doctor or lawyer\\" due to the fact that swallowing sperm has the same effect as letting it hit the ground ‚Å†‚Äî namely, it cannot result in conception either way. He also criticized the level of eroticism stating, \\"There's something non-erotic about skipping past the courting, past the foreplay, past the actual sex, and getting straight to the sperm-swallowing. They might as well have skipped directly to sleeping on the wet spot.\\" Destructoid founder Niero Gonzalez listed it as the second most sexual Atari 2600 game ever made. Brett Elston criticized early Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em for its depiction of women as \\"crudely designed slamholes.\\" GamesTM used it as an example of Atari 2600 games that feature masturbation as its core gameplay mechanic. Luke Plunkett noted that Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em was a \\"relatively harmless\\" adult game for the Atari, in contrast with Custer's Revenge. Daemon Hatfield expressed amazement that Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em was made 20 years before the video game sex controversy Hot Coffee. PJ Hruschak wrote that games like Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em were more \\"silly than sexy.\\" Luke of PALGN commented that Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em was \\"tasteless\\" and \\"inappropriate.\\" Steven Poole satirized the News International phone hacking scandal using Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em called Whack 'Em & Hack 'Em in a commentary on the Supreme Court of the United States' ruling that video games are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and America's \\"'obscenity' exception\\" to free speech.

Flowers, and also by the pen-names Edred Thorsson, and Darban-i-Den, is a former American professor and runologist, and proponent of occultism, Odianism, Germanic mysticism, Asatru, and Mazdaism. He helped establish the Germanic Neopagan movement in North America and has also been active in Left- Hand Path occult organizations. He has over three dozen published books and hundreds of published papers and translations on a disparate range of subjects. Flowers advocates \\"Esoteric Runology and runosophy\\" and \\"Odianism\\" (occultist aspects of Germanic Neopaganism).Runelore: A Handbook of Esoteric Runology (1987), p. 172. Background The Bonham, Texas-born scholar was the only son of Betty Jane Eden, daughter of Edred Cosgrove Eden (1888-1945). In 1960 his family moved to Dallas. In September 1971 Flowers left for Germany, where he spent his first two months there studying at the Goethe Institut in Prien am Chiemsee and traveling around central Europe. At the Institut he became involved in the Sadean world of the Chateau Society (Burggesellschaft) and in the Order of the Trapezoid (Triskelenorden), and was sworn to secrecy regarding these matters for 18 years. Returning to Dallas, Flowers attended the Bryan Adams High School (class of 1971 (September 1972-May 1973)). He joined the Church of Satan in 1972 though he reportedly never became involved with the organization beyond receiving their newsletter, The Cloven Hoof. In the summer of 1974 Flowers moved to Austin and did his graduate work in Germanic and Celtic philology under professor and scholar Edgar Polom√© at the University of Texas at Austin from 1973-1984. In June 1974, while riding in the backseat of a car from Houston to Austin, Flowers says that he heard the sound roonah. This experience was the first milestone in his journey.\\"The drive home to Austin was a silent one. I sat in the back seat, dozing. Then, audibly, in my ear I Heard the sound (roonah), which is the Word, R√õNA. At once I knew what the word referred to: the Germanic writing system of pre- Christian times...[I] went to the library of the University of Texas at Austin...I checked out a wide variety of books on the subject of runes...This volatile mixture of books, most of which had not been opened or read for years, was the first milestone of my journey. The way was opened when the Word signifying the ultimate Mystery was whispered in my ear, as it resonated over the eternal cycle of Ages.\\" Stephen Edred Flowers, R√õNARM√ÇL I: The Runa-Talks: Summer 1991ev, Lodestar, 2017, p. 13. In 1978 Flowers joined the Asatru Free Assembly (old AFA) where he was one of the earliest members, with membership number 072. In May 1979 he received an M.A. degree with a thesis entitled ‚ÄúRebirth and Rites of Transformation in the Saga of Sigur√∞r Sigmundarson‚Äù, (This was later released on a limited basis within the Rune-Gild under the title Sigur√∞r, Rebirth and Initiation, and republished as ‚ÄúSigur√∞r: Rebirth and the Rites of Transformation‚Äù in 2015), and also founded the Austin \\"skeppslag\\" (later kindred) of the AFA. In 1980 he was initiated as a go√∞i by Stephen A. McNallen. Logo of the Rune-Gild with Elder Futhark and Triskelion In Yule-Tide 1979/80 Flowers founded the Rune-Gild, an initiatory order focused on \\"the revival of the elder Runic\\" tradition, advocating runic magic. Flowers currently is the executive officer, or Yrmin-Drighten, of the Rune- Gild. In 1981-1982 he studied the history of occultism and academic runology at the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany under Klaus D√ºwel. Sometime during late 1981 and 1983 he became associated with the Armanen Orden, attending their gatherings at an ancient castle in central Germany, but was never formally or ritually initiated in any of their rites. Contact was again made with the Burggesellschaft. On November 11, 1983 he founded a small group to explore what he saw as the dark, futuristic undercurrent of Odinism called The Order of Shining Trapezohedron or \\"O.S.T.\\" (Order of the Shining Trapezoid) which closed on January 13, 1984. Flowers received his Ph.D. in Germanic Languages and Medieval Studies in 1984 with a dissertation entitled Runes and Magic: Magical Formulaic Elements in the Elder Tradition, and began his career as a university lecturer. From 1984-1989 he was a lecturer in the departments of English and Germanic Languages at the University of Texas. In February 1984 he became a member of the Temple of Set, being recognized to the Second Degree of Adept and to the Priesthood (III¬∞) on October 7, 1984. On November 14, 1986 he was recognized as a Magister Templi (IV¬∞). In November 1987 the AFA (old AFA) collapsed, and on December 20, Thorsson founded the Ring of Troth. The leadership‚ÄúMother Night refers to the first twelve nights of the Yule celebration...The ceremony itself was a simple one. Only Thorsson and Chisholm were present at the ceremonial site, a stone altar behind Thorsson‚Äôs house in Austin. Thorsson ‚Äòinvested‚Äô Chisholm with the steersmanship of the RoT by transferring to him with ‚Äúappropriate words‚Äù several symbols of the foundation of the religion: a Thor‚Äôs hammer which Thorsson had worn to the first √Åsatr√∫ Free Assembly Althing in 1979, a stone from the Assembly Rock in Iceland, and a twig from an ash tree taken from the site of the last functioning temple of the Old religion at Uppsala, Sweden. This ended with ‚Äúthe declaration that the Ring of Troth was hereby founded with the aim of reestablishing the ancestral faith of the Germanic peoples‚Äù (interview with Thorsson, 15 April 1993). James R. Lewis, Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft, Syracuse University Press, 1996. p.231, n. 41. fell to James Allen Chisholm, with Thorsson remaining as a spiritual advisor. In 1989 Meek and others began a campaign again Thorsson, ‚Äúexposing‚Äù him of practicing dark arts and being a member of the Temple of Set, although this was well known within the Asatru community and was never a secret. In the Summer of 1990 he was recognized to the Fifth Degree of the Temple of Set. The O.S.T. served as a segue into his involvement with the Temple of Set, an organization in which he currently holds the degree of Ipsissimus VI¬∞. Within the Temple of Set he served as Grand Master of the Order of the Trapezoid from January 1987 until June 1996. In 1990 he met his wife, Crystal Dawn. It was also during this time that the 18-year ban on manifestation of the Order of the Triskelion (Triskelenorden) was lifted - an organization for the practice of operant Sadeanism and Carnal Alchemy, founded in early 1991 by Thorsson and Dawn. In March 1992 the administrative power of the Ring of Troth was handed over to Prudence Priest and a full contingency of Rede members by Chisholm, which gave Thorsson the ability to spend most of his time to matters pertaining to the Rune-Gild. In 1993 Thorsson and Dawn bought 30 acres of wilderness east of Austin and adjacent to Buescher State Park, named Woodharrow, on which the future history of the Gild and of the many of Thorsson's many other undertakings would be written. At the end of 1993 they moved to Woodharrow and over the next two years built up the physical facilities on the land where a meeting hall was erected and completed in 1996. In 1993 the publishing company R√ªna-Raven Press formerly began and continued to develop over the years. In the Spring of 1995, due to inner turmoil, Thorsson withdrew from any involvement with the Ring of Troth. In August 1995 he and Dawn traveled to Iceland and England to strengthen the work of the Gild. In April 1996 Thorsson retired from his position as Grand Master of the Order of the Trapezoid in order to focus more intently on Rune-Gild matters.Chisholm, James Allen; Appendix A, The Awakening of a Runemaster: The Life of Edred Thorsson, from Thorsson, Edred; Green R√ªna - The Runemaster's Notebook: Shorter Works of Edred Thorsson Volume I (1978-1985)\\", 1993, second improved and expanded edition 1996.Lodestar IV (February 2015) ‚Äì Newsletter of the emerging enterprise, Lodestar.Flowers, Stephen Edred; Freemasonry and the Germanic Tradition, R√ªna-Raven Press, 2008, p. 11\\"Runes: The Journal of the Order of the Trapezoid\\" Vol XIV Number 2Kaplan, Jeffrey; Radical Religion in America: Millenarian Movements from the Far Right to the Children of Noah, Syracuse University Press, 1997. pp. 21-29, 159-160.Gardell, Mattias; Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism, Duke University Press, 2003. pp. 19, 162-164, 284, 286, 321-323.Lewis, James R.; Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft, State University of New York Press, 1996. pp. 197, 210, 213-224.Betty A.

It opened in 1966.  History  Central Cabarrus High School was formed in 1966 by joining three area high schools: Bethel, Harrisburg, and Hartsell. In its beginning, Central was home to 850 students and 45 teachers. The focal point of the new school was the C.A. Furr Planetarium, the only school planetarium in the state of North Carolina. Central boasted a space age classroom during a space enthralled time. Central was a direct result of desegregation in the education system of North Carolina. Mr. M.L. Barnes, for whom the theatre is named, was the first principal of Central Cabarrus. At the time, Jay M. Robinson was the superintendent of Cabarrus County Schools and Joseph N. Fries, the assistant superintendent. Inaugural coaches and long-time Central staff included head football coach, Lloyd \\"Dink\\" Jordan, basketball coaches, Earl Mason and Georgia Roberson, and track coach, Gary \\"Chromedome\\" Drinnen. Born in Central's first year of operation were publications, The Centarune, the school yearbook, and The Norlande, the school newspaper. Mr. Euell Gary Brady served as the first librarian with 8,000 books and 125 periodicals. \\"Dear Ruth,\\" Central's first theatrical production was directed by Mrs. Marjorie Hudson. Director Neil Wilson led the first band which consisted of 40 members, and Mr. David Stantz was the first chorus teacher.  Academics  Central's academic curriculum falls in line with the North Carolina Standard Course of Study in all core subject areas. The school also offers a variety of Advanced Placement courses including AP Human Geography, AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Studio Art, and many others. As of the 2007-2008 school year, 3% of the student body were listed as pursuing advanced college prep courses and the average class size was 20 students.http://www.ncreportcards.org/src/schDetails.jsp?pYear=2007-2008&pLEACode;=130&pSchCode;=310 Central has been consistently recognized as a \\"School of Distinction\\" under the state's ABC standards for public schools. English teacher Susan Deaton Parker was named Cabarrus County Teacher of the Year for the 2005-2006 academic year. Math teacher Allison Hahn was named Cabarrus County Teacher of the Year for the 2014-2015 academic year.  STEM Magnet Program  Central Cabarrus is also home to a STEM magnet program, where students are able to take classes in relation to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and design.https://www.cabarrus.k12.nc.us/cms/lib/NC01910456/Centricity/Domain/2606/STEM%20Brochure%202016.pdf Central is one of only two high schools in Cabarrus County's K-12 STEM Pipeline, the only program of its kind in the state of North Carolina. Students must apply in middle school for consideration into the program, where they must maintain an overall grade average of 80% (based on the final average of all courses taken each year).https://www.cabarrus.k12.nc.us/Page/53143 Students can take classes in Technology Design, Game Design, Photography, and STEM-oriented core classes, amongst other courses. https://www.cabarrus.k12.nc.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=87999&dataid;=280361&FileName;=Central%20Cabarrus%20STEM%20Pathways- NEWEST-Ben%20A.docx While students take these courses with only other STEM students, they are free to take AP classes and electives with the general student body of the school.https://www.cabarrus.k12.nc.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=87999&dataid;=219729&FileName;=STEM%20Academic%20Attendance%20and%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20Policy.docx  The arts  Central Cabarrus is home to the M.L. Barnes Theatre, the only modified thrust theatre in Concord, North Carolina. Its stadium seating holds up to 350 patrons and is also home to a new black box stage which holds, roughly, 50. The walls of the theatre host the names of notable productions, including \\"Godspell\\", \\"Hello, Dolly!\\", \\"Carousel\\", \\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\\", and a myriad of other popular shows. The Choral program has been rebuilt over the years. The CCHS Chorus has received \\"Superior\\" ratings from the NCMEA several years in a row, and has participated in the North Carolina All-State Chorus, Mars Hill College Choral Festival, NC Honors Chorus, and the Wingate Choral festival. Notable award-winning directors include Stephanie Campbell, a Central alumna, and Dennis Jewett.  Athletics  Central's athletic teams are known as the Vikings. In 2009, after eight years in the 4A classification of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA), Central moved back to the 3A classification, where they had been placed prior to 2001. The school sponsors cross country, football, wrestling, soccer, basketball, swimming, volleyball, softball, men's and women's tennis, track and field, and cheerleading. Central historically, is arguably the most successful athletic program of the six high schools in Cabarrus County. Most visible of all athletic programs is the school's softball team, which has won five state championships (3A classification in 1993, 2000, and 2001; 4A classification in 2004 and 2005). A May 2006 loss to North Davidson in the 4A softball playoffs broke the Lady Vikings' win streak of 83 games. The 2006 season ended with the softball team ranked 2nd in the nation after several weeks at the number one spot according to the NFCA poll. In addition to softball, Central's boys basketball team has reared numerous college prospects and won the 3A state championship in 2000. The men's tennis team has gone from not having a team in 2003 to making the state playoffs amazingly in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2017. They also had a doubles team in the State Championship each of those years (2004: Shoaf/Keller; 2005, 2006, 2007: Warber/Warber). The girls tennis team won the MECA-6 conference in the fall of 2006 and made the state playoffs for the second year in a row. The baseball program has made the state playoffs the last ten years. The volleyball team has also consistently made the state playoffs each year. The cheerleading squad, which is co-ed, has won numerous State and National Championships.  In popular culture  Central Cabarrus was the primary filming location for the movie Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green. The school was transformed into \\"Jefferson Park High School\\" for the film.

Speedloaders come in a variety of forms for reloading revolvers, or the magazines used with other types of firearms. Generally, speedloaders are used for loading multiple chambers of a revolver simultaneously. Such speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing-out cylinders or top- break cylinders. Revolvers having fixed cylinders must be unloaded and loaded one chamber at a time. Speedloaders of different designs are used for loading the fixed tubular magazines of shotguns and rifles. Other speedloader designs are used to load the magazines (fixed or detachable) of semi-automatic firearms. Revolver speedloaders =Circular reloaders= 1858 New Model Army black-powder cap-and-ball revolver replica. The cylinder has been removed from the frame. The modern revolver circular speedloader holds a full cylinder complement of cartridges in a secure fashion, spaced in a circular configuration so as to allow the cartridges to drop simultaneously into the cylinder easily (although non-circular types such as half-moon clips are very common as well). A mechanism is provided that allows the cartridges to be released from the speedloader when loaded, so that when it is removed, the cartridges remain in the cylinder. The most common type of speedloader uses a rotating latch. Another type slides the cartridges out an open side; and a third type has a latch that releases when pressed. Revolver speedloaders make the process of reloading an appropriately matched revolver much faster than reloading one round at a time (provided you have ready-loaded speedloaders available). Swing-out and top-break revolvers are designed to eject all cartridges with one movement, and speedloaders allow loading with but a single additional step. Speedloaders also provide a convenient way to carry ammunition for a revolver. Speedloaders do not, however, allow revolvers to be reloaded as fast as semiautomatic handguns without considerably more practice. Prior to the introduction of speedloaders for revolvers, reloading of revolvers was always accomplished by manually loading each cartridge into each chamber from cartridge loops on a belt or bandolier, a cartridge pouch, or other cartridge holder, such as a pocket. In fact, hand-loading is still the most common way of loading a revolver, speedloaders being mostly restricted to competition shooters and those who feel that they need more firepower for their personal defense revolver, since although speedloaders are useful for carrying one or several reloads at ready, one must load the speedloaders themselves prior to using. Prior to the introduction of modern metallic cartridges, circa 1861‚Äì1873, certain models of older black powder cap and ball revolvers could be used with multiple replaceable cylinders functioning as \\"speedloaders\\". It was however generally easier to simply buy a second revolver than to locate a cylinder alone, not to mention faster than swapping cylinders. As the reloading process for a cap and ball revolver was lengthy and time-consuming, carrying already-loaded cylinders with percussion caps placed on cylinder nipples was a considerable improvement in reloading time, although this is primarily a \\"trick\\" used by modern shooters who are used to having numerous shots available in short time with little work. When \\"spare cylinders\\" were carried, this practice was primarily done on Remington revolvers, as their cylinders were easily removable and were held by a cylinder pin, unlike the early Colt revolvers, which were held together by a wedge that went through the cylinder pin. The first revolver speedloader patented was that of William H. Bell in 1879.https://www.guns.com/news/2013/03/30/revolver-speedloaders =Moon clips and half-moon clips= Full and half moon clips loaded with .45 ACP ammunition Moon clips and half-moon clips are special speedloaders for use with revolvers that chamber rimless cartridges, such as 9√ó19mm Parabellum or .45 ACP. Double- action revolvers are designed to use rimmed cartridges, and the extractors are incapable of removing rimless cartridges. Because of this fact, a different method of extraction must be used. Moon clips are a full circle, and hold a full cylinder of cartridges, while half-moon clips are semicircles that hold half a cylinder full of cartridges. =Speed strips= Another variation of the speedloader for revolvers is the Speed Strip introduced by Bianchi International. Intended as an alternative to loose rounds in a pocket or dump pouch, it holds six cartridges in a re-usable Neoprene plastic strip. The strip operates by placing the cartridges one or two at a time into their respective chambers, and \\"breaking\\" the rounds off the strip into the chamber. Magazine loaders UpLULA universal pistol magazine loader Loading a firearm magazine, particularly one with a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds to the top of the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler, which are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as magazine loaders, stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. The simplest are inexpensive devices that depress the top round in the magazine, allowing the next round to be partially inserted with no pressure on it. These are also called \\"thumb savers\\", and address ease of loading more than speed of loading. There are also devices available for certain popular firearms, such as the Ruger 10/22, that accept loose ammunition and will load a round into the magazine with a simple push of a button or turn of a crank. These are more complex and expensive (US$25 to US$50), but are more truly a speedloader since they do greatly reduce the time required to load a magazine. Stripper clips 5.56 NATO stripper clip and speedloader. A stripper clip is a device that holds a number of rounds, usually from 5 to 10 rounds, and allows them to be inserted into a magazine (fixed or detachable) by attaching the clip to a special bracket and pressing the rounds into place. Military ammunition is often packaged in stripper clips, which, in older bolt action rifles, could be loaded directly into the rifle's fixed magazine using a bracket machined into the rifle's action, or in modern rifles by the use of an adapter or guide that attaches the stripper clip to a detachable magazine. Shotgun and rifle quickloaders While much less common than revolver speedloaders, speedloaders for tubular magazines, called quickloaders, have been around for many years and offer many of the same quick reloading ability benefits. The simplest quickloader of this type is the one used for rimfire rifles with front loading tubular magazines. In this case, the quickloader is simply a tube that contains a magazine-capacity number of cartridges, with a seal at one end and a gate at the other. To load the magazine, the follower is removed, the rifle is pointed upwards, the tube is placed over the end of the magazine, and the gate is opened. Gravity then pulls the cartridges from the quickloader into the magazine, the quickloader is set aside, and the follower is replaced. Any length of tubing or pipe of the right diameter can be used in this way, with a simple pin through the middle serving as a gate. Commercial rimfire quickloaders often have multiple tubes joined together in parallel, with a single rotating gate. This allows multiple reloads to be carried, with reloading accomplished by simply rotating the gate in line with the next full tube of ammunition. Shotgun speedloaders are slightly more complex, since shotgun magazines load from the breech. Shotgun speedloaders generally require a special bracket be mounted near the magazine loading port of the gun; many models mount by replacing existing pins that hold the trigger group in the receiver, and so can be installed easily without permanent modification of the gun. This bracket serves to hold the end of the speedloader tube in the correct position to feed the rounds out of the speedloader and into the magazine. The speedloaders themselves consist of a plastic tube containing a slot cut in it, and a plunger that rides in the slot and that forces the rounds into the magazine. Capacity is usually four or five rounds of 2-inch (70 mm) length shells. Gravity is not suitable for operating these, as the rounds must be forced into the magazine against the pressure of the magazine spring. Shotgun speedloaders are most commonly encountered in action shooting sports like International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) shotgun competitions.

The eaves form an overhang to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style, such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems. Etymology and usage According to the Oxford English Dictionary, eaves is derived from the Old English (singular), meaning edge, and consequently forms both the singular and plural of the word. Eaves. def. 1a. Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 This Old English word is itself of Germanic origin, related to the German dialect Obsen, and also probably to over. The Merriam-Webster dictionary lists the word as eave but notes that it is \\"usually used in plural\\"..  Function  The primary function of the eaves is to keep rain water off the walls and to prevent the ingress of water at the junction where the roof meets the wall. The eaves may also protect a pathway around the building from the rain, prevent erosion of the footings, and reduce splatter on the wall from rain as it hits the ground. The secondary function is to control solar penetration as a form of passive solar building design; the eaves overhang can be designed to adjust the building's solar gain to suit the local climate, the latitude and orientation of the building. The eaves overhang may also shelter openings to ventilate the roof space.  Design  Italianate eaves with decorative support brackets Aesthetic, traditional or purely decorative considerations may prevail over the strictly functional requirements of the eaves. The Arts and Crafts Movement influenced the American Craftsman tradition, which has very wide eaves with decorative brackets, for which there is not necessarily a real functional need; likewise the Italian-style eaves. The eaves may terminate in a fascia, a board running the length of the eaves under the tiles or roof sheets to cap off and protect the exposed rafter ends and to provide grounds on which to fix gutters. At the gables the eaves may extend beyond the gable end wall by projecting the purlins and are usually capped off by bargeboards to protect the wall and the purlin ends. The underside of the eaves may be filled with a horizontal soffit fixed at right angles to the wall, the soffit may be decorative but it also has the function of sealing the gap between the rafters from vermin and weather. Eaves must be designed for local wind speeds as the overhang can significantly increase the wind loading on the roof. The line on the ground under the outer edge of the eaves is the eavesdrip, or dripline, and in typical building planning regulations defines the extent of the building and cannot oversail the property boundary.

The Betar fortress was the last standing Jewish fortress in the Bar Kokhba revolt of the 2nd century CE, destroyed by the Roman army of Emperor Hadrian in the year 135. The site of historic Betar (also spelled Beitar or Bethar), next to the modern Palestinian village of Battir, southwest of Jerusalem, is known as Khirbet al-Yahud in Arabic (meaning \\"ruin of the Jews\\"). Today, the Israeli settlement and city Beitar Illit is also located nearby. Etymology Bet tar in ancient Hebrew means the place of the blade. Based on the variant spelling found in the Jerusalem Talmud (Codex Leiden), where the place name is written ◊ë÷µ÷º◊ô◊™◊™÷π÷º◊®, the name may have simply been a contraction of two words: ◊ë◊ô◊™ + ◊™◊®, 'bet + tor', meaning, \\"the house of a dove.\\" History and archaeology =Early mentions= The origins of Betar are likely in the Iron Age Kingdom of Judea. It is not mentioned in the canonical Hebrew Bible, but is added in the Septuagint as one of the cities of the Tribe of Judah. The location produced archaeological finds of pottery beginning from 8th century BCE and until late period of the Kingdom of Judah and again from early Roman period. In the early second century the town was a major stronghold and urban center in the Bethlehem area. =Bar Kokhba revolt= The city was the stronghold of Bar Kokhba, the leader of the Jewish Revolt against Roman occupation and took place in the days of Emperor Hadrian. After losing many of their strongholds, Bar Kokhba and the remnants of his army withdrew to the fortress of Betar, which subsequently came under siege in the summer of 135.

Roman Inscription found near Battir mentioning the 5th and 11th Roman Legions =Aftermath= The destruction of Betar in 135 put an end to the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars against Rome, and effectively quashed any Jewish hopes for self-governance in that period. Following the Fall of Betar, the Romans went on a systematic campaign of wiping out the remaining Judean villages, and hunting down refugees and the remaining rebels, with the last pockets of resistance being eliminated by the spring of 136.Mohr Siebek et al. Edited by Peter Sch√§fer. The Bar Kokhba War reconsidered. 2003. P160. \\"Thus it is very likely that the revolt ended only in early 136.\\" Talmud narrative and Jewish tradition According to the Jerusalem Talmud, also known as the Palestinian Talmud, Betar remained a thriving town fifty-two years after the destruction of the Second Temple, until it came to its demise.Jerusalem Talmud (Ta'anit 4:5 [24b]) =Siege= According to the Jerusalem Talmud, the city was besieged for three and a half years before it finally fell (Jerusalem Talmud, Taanit 4:5 [24a]). According to Jewish tradition, the fortress was breached and destroyed on the fast of Tisha B'av, in the year 135, on the ninth day of the lunar month Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the First and the Second Jewish Temple. Earlier, when the Roman army had circumvallated the city (from Latin, circum- + vallum, round- about + rampart), some sixty men of Israel went down and tried to make a breach in the Roman rampart, but to no avail. When they had not returned and were assumed as dead, the Sages of Israel permitted their wives to remarry, even though their husbands' bodies had not been retrieved.Tosefta (Yevamot 14:8) =Massacre= The massacre perpetrated against all defenders, including the children who were found in the city, is described by the Palestinian Talmud.Palestinian Talmud, Taanit 4:5 (24a); Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5). The Jerusalem Talmud relates that the number of dead in Betar was enormous, that the Romans \\"went on killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils.\\"Ta'anit 4:5 The Romans killed all the defenders except for one Jewish youth whose life was spared, viz. Simeon ben Gamliel.Palestinian Talmud, Taanit 4:5 (24a‚Äìb) Hadrian had prohibited the burial of the dead, and so all the bodies remained above ground. According to Jewish legend, they miraculously did not decompose.Burial at Betar, blog. Many years later Hadrian's successor, Antoninus (Pius), allowed the dead to be afforded a decent burial. =Rabbinical explanation= Rabbinical literature ascribes the defeat to Bar Kokhba killing his maternal uncle, Rabbi Elazar Hamuda ªi, after suspecting him of collaborating with the enemy, thereby forfeiting Divine protection.Jerusalem Talmud Ta'anit iv. 68d; Lamentations Rabbah ii. 2 =Sources= Accounts of the Fall of Betar in Talmudic and Midrashic writings reflect and amplify its importance in the Jewish psyche and oral tradition in the subsequent period. The best known is from the Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 57a-58a: > Rabbi Yohanan has related the following account of the massacre:Midrash > Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5) \\"The brains of three-hundred children were > found upon one stone, along with three-hundred baskets of what remained of > phylacteries () were found in Betar, each and every one of which had the > capacity to hold three measures (three , or what is equivalent to about 28 > liters). If you should come to take [all of them] into account, you would > find that they amounted to three-hundred measures.\\" Rabban [Shimon] Gamliel > said: \\"Five-hundred schools were in Betar, while the smallest of them wasn't > less than three-hundred children. They used to say, 'If the enemy should > ever come upon us, with these styli [used in pointing at the letters of > sacred writ] we'll go forth and stab them.' But since iniquities had caused > [their fall], the enemy came in and wrapped up each and every child in his > own book and burnt them together, and no one remained except me.\\" Legacy =Judaic religion= The fouth blessing that is said by Israel in the Grace over meals is said to have been enacted by the Sages of Israel in recognition of the dead at Betar who, although not afforded proper burial, their bodies did not putrefy and were, at last, brought to burial.Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 48b =Revisionist and Religious Zionism= The name of the Revisionist Zionist youth movement Betar (◊ë◊ô◊™\\"◊®) refers to both the last Jewish fort to fall in the Bar Kokhba revolt, and to the slightly altered abbreviation of the Hebrew phrase \\"Berit Trumpeldor\\" or \\"Brit Yosef Trumpeldor\\" (◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊™◊®◊ï◊û◊§◊ú◊ì◊ï◊®), lit. 'Joseph Trumpeldor Alliance'. The village of Mevo Betar was established on 24 April 1950 by native Israelis and immigrants from Argentina who were members of the Beitar movement, including Matityahu Drobles, later a member of the Knesset.About Mevo Beitar It was founded in the vicinity of the Betar fortress location, around a kilometre from the Green Line, which gave it the character of an exposed border settlement until the Six-Day War. Beitar Illit, lit. Upper Beitar, is named after the ancient Jewish city of Betar, whose ruins lie away. It was established by a small group of young families from the religious Zionist yeshiva of Machon Meir. The first residents settled in 1990.Tzoren, Moshe Michael. \\"Some Talk Peace, Others Live It\\". Hamodia Israel News, November 21, 2018, pp. A18-A19.

Extent and duration The Khvalynsk culture extended from Saratov in the north to the North Caucasus in the south, from the Sea of Azov in the west to the Ural River in the east. A good sprinkling of calibrated C-14 readings obtained from material in the graves of the type site date the culture certainly to the approximate window, 5000‚Äì4500 BC. This material is from Khvalynsk I, or Early Khvalynsk. Khvalynsk II, or Late Khvalynsk, is Late Eneolithic.

Marija Gimbutas, however, believed Samara was earlier and placed Khvalynsk I in the Developed Eneolithic. Not enough Samara culture dates and sites exist to settle the question. After c. 4500 BC, Khvalynsk culture united the lower and middle Volga sites keeping domesticated sheep, goats, cattle, and maybe horses.Anthony, David W., 2019. \\"Archaeology, Genetics, and Language in the Steppes: A Comment on Bomhard\\", in The Journal of Indo-European Studies Vol. 47, Nos. 1 & 2 (Spring/Summer 2019), p. 13[187]. Sites The Khvalynsk type site is a cemetery, 30 m by 26 m, containing about 158 skeletons, mainly in single graves, but some two to five together. They were buried on their backs with knees contracted. Twelve of the graves were covered with stone cairns. Sacrificial areas were found similar to those at Samara, containing horse, cattle and sheep remains. An individual grave was found in 1929 at Krivoluchie with grave goods and the remains placed on ochre, face up, knees contracted. A 67 m high earthen kurgan at Nalchik, approximately thirty metres in diameter, contained 121 individual graves of remains placed face up, knees contracted, on ochre with a covering of stone. Artifacts Khvalinsk evidences the further development of the kurgan. It began in the Samara with individual graves or small groups sometimes under stone. In the Khvalinsk culture one finds group graves, which can only be communal on some basis, whether familial or local or both is not clear. With the advent of DNA testing, perhaps someday it will be. Although there are disparities in the wealth of the grave goods, there seems to be no special marker for the chief. This deficit does not exclude the possibility of a chief. In the later kurgans, one finds that the kurgan is exclusively reserved for a chief and his retinue, with ordinary people excluded. This development suggests a growing disparity of wealth, which in turn implies a growth in the wealth of the whole community and an increase in population. The explosion of the kurgan culture out of its western steppe homeland must be associated with an expansion of population. The causes of this success and expansion remain obscure. We do know that metal was available both in the Caucasus and in the southern Urals. The Khvalynsk graves included metal rings and spiral metal rings. However, there is no indication of any use beyond ornamental. The quality of stone weapons and implements reaches a high point. The Krivoluchie grave, which Gimbutas viewed as that of a chief, contained a long flint dagger and tanged arrowheads, all carefully retouched on both faces. In addition there is a porphyry axe-head with lugs and a haft hole. These artifacts are of types that not too long after appeared in metal. There is also plenty of evidence of personal jewelry: beads of shell, stone and animal teeth, bracelets of stone or bone, pendants of boar tusk. The animals whose teeth came to decorate the putative Indo-Europeans are boar, bear, wolf, deer and others. Some of these teeth must have been difficult to acquire, a labor perhaps that led to a value being placed upon them. Whether they were money is not known. The hard goods leave no record of any great richness. There is some evidence that wealth may have consisted of perishable goods. In fact, in many similar cultures of later times, wealth was reckoned in livestock. A recent study of the surface of the pottery (also of many cultures), which recorded contact with perishable material while the clay was wet, indicates contact with cords and embroidered woven cloth, which the investigators suggest were used to decorate the pot. Physical type Examination of physical remains of the Kvalynsk people has determined that they were Europoid. A similar physical type prevails among the Sredny Stog culture and the Yamnaya culture, whose peoples were tall and powerfully built. Khvalynsk people were however not as powerfully built as the Sredny Stog and Yamnaya. The people of the Dnieper-Donets culture further west on the other hand, were even more powerfully built than the Yamnaya. Genetics Recent genetic studies have shown that males of the Khvalynsk culture carried primarily the paternal haplogroup R1b, although a few samples of R1a, I2a2, Q1a and J has been detected. They belonged to the Western Steppe Herder (WSH) cluster, which is a mixture of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) and Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) ancestry. This admixture appears to have happened on the eastern Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe around starting around 5,000 BC. A male from the contemporary Sredny Stog culture was found to have 80% WSH ancestry of a similar type to the Khvalynsk people, and 20% Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry. Among the later Yamnaya culture, males carry exclusively R1b and I2. A similar pattern is observable among males of the earlier Dnieper-Donets culture, who carried only R and I and whose ancestry was exclusively EHG with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) admixture. The presence of EEF and CHG mtDNA and exclusively EHG and WHG Y-DNA among the Yamnaya and related WSHs suggest that EEF and CHG admixture among them was the result of mixing between EHG and WHG males, and EEF and CHG females. This suggests that the leading clans among the Yamnaya were of EHG paternal origin. According to David W. Anthony, this implies that the Indo-European languages were the result of \\"a dominant language spoken by EHGs that absorbed Caucasus-like elements in phonology, morphology, and lexicon\\".(spoken by CHGs) Notes References Sources  * *J.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that are most commonly known as a primary marker of Alzheimer's disease. Their presence is also found in numerous other diseases known as tauopathies. Little is known about their exact relationship to the different pathologies. Formation Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule-associated protein known as tau, causing it to aggregate, or group, in an insoluble form. (These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as PHF, or \\"paired helical filaments\\"). The precise mechanism of tangle formation is not completely understood, and it is still controversial whether tangles are a primary causative factor in disease or play a more peripheral role. =Cytoskeletal changes= Three different maturation states of NFT have been defined using anti-tau and anti-ubiquitin immunostaining. At stage 0 there are morphologically normal pyramidal cells showing diffuse or fine granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-tau. In other words, cells are healthy with minimal tau presence; at stage 1 some delicate elongate inclusions are stained by tau antibodies (these are early tangles); stage 2 is represented by the classic NFT demonstration with anti-tau staining; stage 3 is exemplified by ghost tangles (tangles outside of cells where the host neuron has died), which are characterized by a reduced anti-tau but marked anti-ubiquitin immunostaining. Causes Diagram of how microtubules disintegrate with Alzheimer's disease =Mutated tau= The traditional understanding is that tau binds to microtubules and assists with their formation and stabilization. However, when tau is hyperphosphorylated, it is unable to bind and the microtubules become unstable and begin disintegrating. The unbound tau clumps together in formations called neurofibrillary tangles. More explicitly, intracellular lesions known as pretangles develop when tau is phosphorylated excessively and on improper amino acid residues. These lesions, over time, develop into filamentous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which interfere with numerous intracellular functions. Seeking a reliable animal model for tau- related pathologies, researchers expressed the human mutant P301L tau gene in adult mice. This experiment resulted in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and pretangle formations. The human mutant P301 tau gene is associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, another tauopathy associated with NFTs. It was found that the degree of tau pathology was dependent on time and the level of gene expression. Groups receiving a combination of a promoter and enhancer in the vector saw increased tau expression, as early as 3 weeks after vector injection, which was measured using a Western blot. These groups also showed a greater pathology compared to those with less expression of the mutant tau. Additionally, NFTs were clearly detected by immunoelectron microscopy at 4 months but not at 2 months. However, at both 2 and 4 months, pretangle-like structures were observed suggesting the NFT formation is not complete by 4 months and will continue to progress with time. =Traumatic brain injury = Preliminary research indicates that iron deposits due to hemorrhaging, following traumatic brain injury (TBI), may increase tau pathology. While TBI does not routinely lead to accelerated NFT formation, further work may determine if other blood components or factors unrelated to hemorrhages are involved in this TBI-induced augmentation of tau pathology. NFTs are most commonly seen associated with repetitive mild TBI as opposed to one instance of severe traumatic brain injury. For example, the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), previously called dementia pugilistica, is highly associated with NFTs and neuropil threads. =Aluminium= The idea that there is a link between aluminium exposure and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles has floated around the scientific community for some time without having been definitively proved or disregarded. Recently a study examining the hippocampal CA1 cells from individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease showed a small portion of the pyramidal cells contain cytoplasmic pools within their somas containing early NFTs. These cytoplasmic pools are aggregates of an aluminium/hyperphosphorylated tau complex similar to mature NFTs. (Walton) While a connection between aluminium and NFTs and AD is maintained, there is evidence that aluminium does not directly cause the formation of NFTs or AD. However it is claimed that chronic aluminium intake can cause Alzheimer's by disrupting the microtubules in the filaments. Pathology It has been shown that the degree of cognitive impairment in diseases such as AD is significantly correlated with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. =Harmful or protective?= There has been some suggestion that the formation of NFTs does not have a causal relationship with disease. Rather that NFTs may be produced in response to a variety of conditions and may in fact be a compensatory response against oxidative stress and serves a protective function. Several points are made to argue the position that NFTs are perhaps protective instead of harmful. First there appears to be a dispute as to the impact of neurofibrillary tangles on neuronal viability because some neurons containing NFTs survive for decades. Furthermore, NFTs have been found in apparently healthy individuals, indicating that NFTs are not directly related to neural degeneration. It has been proposed that the formation of NFTs is part of a multifaceted compensatory response where oxidative insult activates several kinases, which are then capable of phosphorylating tau. This then prompts the early formation of NFTs, which reduce oxidative damage and prolong the function of the neuron. While the theory is intriguing, scientists have not come to a firm conclusion as to what role NFTs play in neurodegenerative diseases. Results from the new study suggest that a specific phosphorylation of tau (at threonine-205) has a protective effect on neurons in a mouse model of excitotoxic, amyloid beta toxicity. The authors suggest that the reason tau becomes modified is to protect from damage caused by amyloid protein aggregation. A protein called kinase p38Œ≥ phosphorylates tau at the threonine-205 amino acid. The activity of this gamma kinase enzyme is mostly lost as Alzheimer Disease progresses, suggesting a loss of this protective effect. Reintroducing p38Œ≥ and increasing its activity prevented memory deficits from occurring in their mouse model, suggesting this enzyme as a potential target for future therapies. However increasing the activity of kinases has been shown to be difficult). =Neuron loss= Traditionally believed to play a major role in neuron loss, NFTs are an early event in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, and as more NFTs form, there is substantially more neuron loss. However, it has been shown that there is significant neuron loss before the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and that NFTs account for only a small proportion (around 8.1%) of this neuron loss. Coupled with the longevity of neurons containing NFTs, it is likely that some other factor is primarily responsible for the bulk of neuron loss in these diseases, not the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. =Primary age- related tauopathy vs. classical Alzheimer's= It is currently unclear as to whether or not primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a term which includes some cases formerly referred to as neurofibrillary tangle-predominant dementia (NFTPD) or tangle-only dementia, is a variant of the traditional Alzheimer's disease, or a distinct entity. Characterized by later onset and milder cognitive impairment, the distribution of NFT pathology is more closely related to that found in centenarians showing no or limited cognitive impairment. NFTs are generally limited to allocortical/limbic regions of the brain with limited progression to the neocortex but a greater density in the allocortical/hippocampal region. Plaques are generally absent. =Alzheimer disease with concomitant dementia with Lewy bodies (AD+DLB) = The degree of NFT involvement in AD is defined by Braak staging. Braak stages I and II are used when NFT involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain. Stages III and IV are indicated when there is involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and V and VI when there's extensive neocortical involvement. This should not be confused with the degree of senile plaque involvement, which progresses differently. Neurofibrillary tangle and modified Braak scores were lower in AD+DLB, however, neocortical NFT scores show markedly different patterns between AD+DLB and Classical Alzheimer's. In pure AD, NFT are predominantly found at a high frequency: In AD+DLB, the distribution of NFT frequency was found to be bimodal: NFTs were either frequent or few to absent. Additionally, neocortical NFT frequency in the AD+DLB group tended to parallel the severity of other types of tau cytopathology. =Link to aggression and depression in Alzheimer's patients= A recent study looked for correlation between the quantitative aspects of Alzheimer's disease (neuron loss, neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle load) and aggression frequently found in Alzheimer's patients. It was found that only an increase in neurofibrillary tangle load was associated with severity of aggression and chronic aggression in Alzheimer's patients. While this study does indicate a correlation between NFT load and severity of aggression, it does not provide a causative argument. Research has also indicated that patients with AD and comorbid depression show higher levels of neurofibrillary tangle formation than individuals with AD but no depression. Comorbid depression increased the odds for advanced neuropathologic disease stage even when controlling for age, gender, education and cognitive function. Treatment Overview of RNA interference. =Statins= Statins have been shown to reduce the neurofibrillary tangle burden in mouse models, likely due to their anti-inflammatory capacities. =Cyclin-dependent kinase 5= Cyclin- dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a kinase that has been previously hypothesized to contribute to tau pathologies. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated silencing of the CDK5 gene has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy against tau pathology, such as neurofibrillary tangles. Knockdown of CDK5 has been shown to reduce the phosphorylation of tau in primary neuronal cultures and in mouse models. Furthermore, this silencing showed a dramatic reduction in the number of neurofibrillary tangles. However, in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, only about 1% is hereditary, and therefore RNAi therapy may be inadequate for addressing the needs of the majority of those who suffer from this disease. =Lithium= Lithium has been shown to decrease the phosphorylation of tau. Lithium treatment has been shown to reduce the density of neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic models in the hippocampus and spinal cord.

Foote joined the Geological Survey of India (GSI) on 29 December 1858 was posted in the Madras Presidency, Hyderabad region and Bombay. In 1887 he became a Director of the GSI and on retiring in 1891, he joined the state of Baroda. In later life, he settled in Yercaud where his father-in-law Reverend Peter Percival had worked and lived. An interest in paleolithic life was inspired by the work of Joseph Prestwich in 1859. In 1863, the year after his archaeological survey began, he discovered the first conclusive Paleolithic stone tool (a hand axe) in India. He found the tool in southern India (Pallavaram, near Madras). After the discovery he, along with William King, went on to discover more such tools and settlements in Southern and Western India. In 1884, he discovered the long Belum Caves, the second largest cave in the Indian subcontinent. Foote spent 33 years (starting at age 24) working for the geological survey. He is often considered the \\"Father of Indian Prehistory\\".Prehistoric Antiquities and Personal Lives: The Untold Story of Robert Bruce Foote, Shanti Pappu, Man and Environment, XXXIII(1): 30-50 (2008) As a geologist, one of his significant contribution to Indian Geology was the \\"Geological Features of the South Mahratta Country and Adjacent Districts\\" (i.e. Border districts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh States in India). He died on 29 December 1912 and was cremated at Calcutta, his ashes were deposited at Holy Trinity Church, Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, India. There is a memorial to him there. Foote was a Fellow of the Geological Society, London from 1867 and a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Foote built a valuable collection as a result of 40 years of geological and pre-historic expeditions in various parts of western and southern India. Foote's collection of antiquities were all sold to the Madras Government Museum in 1906, where it is quoted to be a valuable treasure. His grandson was Major General Henry Bowreman Foote, who was the recipient of the Victoria Cross for his contributions in the defence of the realm during the Second World War (World War 2).

It also provides escorts for foreign visiting heads of state and ambassadors presenting their credentials at the Royal Palace in Brussels. Composition The Royal Escort is not a full-time unit but is brought together on occasions of major ceremony as noted above. It is provided by units of the Federal Police. Prior to the merger of the Gendarmerie and Police, the unit was provided by the Gendarmerie. There are two Royal Escorts: the mounted escort and the motorcycle escort. History The Belgian monarchs have been accompanied by a mounted escort on state occasions since Belgium's independence in 1830. Until 1914 these were provided by detachments drawn from either the Marie-Henriette squadron of the Civic Guard of Brussels or from the Guides Regiments of the regular cavalry of the Belgian Army, based in Brussels. After World War I the disbandment of the Civic Guard led to a suggestion that a separate mounted ceremonial unit be established but the proposal was left in abeyance until the Belgian cavalry was mechanized in 1938. Accordingly in that year a permanent Royal Escort was created as part of the Gendarmerie. The full dress uniform of bearskin, black tunic and white breeches then adopted, and still worn, had been that of the mounted gendarmerie prior to 1914. Modern escorts The cavalry unit of the General Reserve of the Federal Police is responsible for providing the escort. The 132 riders of the Royal Escort all have Belgian mounts. On January 5, 1960, King Baudouin granted the Gendarmerie the privilege of creating a motorised unit tasked with escorting him and important guests. Nowadays, the motorcycle escort is provided by the Provincial Traffic Unit Brabant of the Federal Police's road traffic police.

It is an oxide where lead is in an oxidation state of +4. It is a dark-brown solid which is insoluble in water. It exists in two crystalline forms. It has several important applications in electrochemistry, in particular as the positive plate of lead acid batteries. Properties =Physical= Crystal structure of Œ±-PbO2 Crystal structure of Œ≤-PbO2 Lead dioxide has two major polymorphs, alpha and beta, which occur naturally as rare minerals scrutinyite and plattnerite, respectively. Whereas the beta form had been identified in 1845, Œ±-PbO2 was first identified in 1946 and found as a naturally occurring mineral 1988. The alpha form has orthorhombic symmetry, space group Pbcn (No. 60), Pearson symbol oP12, lattice constants a = 0.497 nm, b = 0.596 nm, c = 0.544 nm, Z = 4 (four formula units per unit cell). The lead atoms are six- coordinate. The symmetry of the beta form is tetragonal, space group P42/mnm (No. 136), Pearson symbol tP6, lattice constants a = 0.491 nm, c = 0.3385 nm, Z = 2 and related to the rutile structure and can be envisaged as containing columns of octahedra sharing opposite edges and joined to other chains by corners. This contrasts with the alpha form where the octahedra are linked by adjacent edges to give zigzag chains. =Chemical= Lead dioxide decomposes upon heating in air as follows: :24 PbO2 ‚Üí 2 Pb12O19 \\\\+ 5 O2 :Pb12O19 ‚Üí Pb12O17 \\\\+ O2 :2 Pb12O17 ‚Üí 8 Pb3O4 \\\\+ O2 :2 Pb3O4 ‚Üí 6 PbO + O2 The stoichiometry of the end product can be controlled by changing the temperature ‚Äì for example, in the above reaction, the first step occurs at 290 ¬∞C, second at 350 ¬∞C, third at 375 ¬∞C and fourth at 600 ¬∞C. In addition, Pb2O3 can be obtained by decomposing PbO2 at 580‚Äì620 ¬∞C under an oxygen pressure of . Therefore, thermal decomposition of lead dioxide is a common way of producing various lead oxides. Lead dioxide is an amphoteric compound with prevalent acidic properties. It dissolves in strong bases to form the hydroxyplumbate ion, [Pb(OH)6]2‚àí: :PbO2 \\\\+ 2 NaOH + 2 H2O ‚Üí Na2[Pb(OH)6] It also reacts with basic oxides in the melt, yielding orthoplumbates M4[PbO4]. Because of the instability of its Pb4+ cation, lead dioxide reacts with hot acids, converting to the more stable Pb2+ state and liberating oxygen: :2 PbO2 \\\\+ 2 H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 PbSO4 \\\\+ 2 H2O + O2 :2 PbO2 \\\\+ 4 HNO3 ‚Üí 2 Pb(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O + O2 :PbO2 \\\\+ 4 HCl ‚Üí PbCl2 \\\\+ 2 H2O + Cl2 However these reactions are slow. Lead dioxide is well known for being a good oxidizing agent, with an example reactions listed below: :2 MnSO4 \\\\+ 5 PbO2 \\\\+ 6 HNO3 ‚Üí 2 HMnO4 \\\\+ 2 PbSO4 \\\\+ 3 Pb(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O :2 Cr(OH)3 \\\\+ 10 KOH + 3 PbO2 ‚Üí 2 K2CrO4 \\\\+ 3 K2PbO2 \\\\+ 8 H2O =Electrochemical= Although the formula of lead dioxide is nominally given as PbO2, the actual oxygen to lead ratio varies between 1.90 and 1.98 depending on the preparation method. Deficiency of oxygen (or excess of lead) results in the characteristic metallic conductivity of lead dioxide, with a resistivity as low as 10‚àí4 Œ©¬∑cm and which is exploited in various electrochemical applications. Like metals, lead dioxide has a characteristic electrode potential, and in electrolytes it can be polarized both anodically and cathodically. Lead dioxide electrodes have a dual action, that is both the lead and oxygen ions take part in the electrochemical reactions. Production =Chemical processes= Lead dioxide is produced commercially by several methods, which include oxidation of red lead (Pb3O4) in alkaline slurry in a chlorine atmosphere, reaction of lead(II) acetate with \\"chloride of lime\\" (calcium hypochlorite), The reaction of Pb3O4 with nitric acid also affords the dioxide: :Pb3O4 \\\\+ 4 HNO3 ‚Üí PbO2 \\\\+ 2 Pb(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O PbO2 reacts with sodium hydroxide to form the hexahydroxoplumbate(IV) ion [Pb(OH)6]2‚àí, soluble in water. =Electrolysis= An alternative synthesis method is electrochemical: lead dioxide forms on pure lead, in dilute sulfuric acid, when polarized anodically at electrode potential about +1.5 V at room temperature. This procedure is used for large-scale industrial production of PbO2 anodes. Lead and copper electrodes are immersed in sulfuric acid flowing at a rate of 5‚Äì10 L/min. The electrodeposition is carried out galvanostatically, by applying a current of about 100 A/m2 for about 30 minutes. The drawback of the lead electrode is its softness, especially compared to the hard and brittle PbO2 which has a Mohs hardness of 5.5. This mismatch in mechanical properties results in peeling of the coating. Therefore, an alternative method is to use harder substrates, such as titanium, niobium, tantalum or graphite and deposit PbO2 onto them from lead(II) nitrate in static or flowing nitric acid. The substrate is usually sand-blasted before the deposition to remove surface oxide and contamination and to increase the surface roughness and adhesion of the coating. Applications Lead dioxide is used in the production of matches, pyrotechnics, dyes and the curing of sulfide polymers. It is also used in the construction of high-voltage lightning arresters. Lead dioxide is used as an anode material in electrochemistry. Œ≤-PbO2 is more attractive for this purpose than the Œ± form because it has relatively low resistivity, good corrosion resistance even in low-pH medium, and a high overvoltage for the evolution of oxygen in sulfuric- and nitric-acid-based electrolytes. Lead dioxide can also withstand chlorine evolution in hydrochloric acid. Lead dioxide anodes are inexpensive and were once used instead of conventional platinum and graphite electrodes for regenerating potassium dichromate. They were also applied as oxygen anodes for electroplating copper and zinc in sulfate baths. In organic synthesis, lead dioxide anodes were applied for the production of glyoxylic acid from oxalic acid in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. The most important use of lead dioxide is as the cathode of lead acid batteries. Its utility arises from the anomalous metallic conductivity of PbO2. The lead acid battery stores and releases energy by shifting the equilibrium (a comproportionation) between metallic lead, lead dioxide, and lead(II) salts in sulfuric acid. :Pb + PbO2 \\\\+ 2 \\\\+ 2 H+ ‚Üí 2 PbSO4 \\\\+ 2 H2O E¬∞ = +2.05 V Safety Lead compounds are poisons.

He worked steadily as a screenwriter in Hollywood while in his 20s but wanted to direct movies. He eventually decided to move to England and began directing quota quickies, such as The Last Journey (1935). After attaining success in England, Vorhaus moved back to the U.S. and began working at Republic Pictures directing B-movies. He was blacklisted in 1951 at HUAC hearings. Vorhaus had already moved to Europe at that time and directed a few minor films while there.

Izapa Stela 5 is one of a number of large, carved stelae found in the ancient Mesoamerican site of Izapa, in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico along the present-day Guatemalan border. These stelae date from roughly 300 BCE to 50 or 100 BCE,Kubler, p. 328, or Pool, p. 273 although some argue for dates as late as 250 CE.Guernsey Kappelman. Also known as the \\"Tree of Life\\" stone,Stirling; Christensen. it appears to illustrate a Mesoamerican creation myth. The stela Documented by Smithsonian archaeologist Matthew W. Stirling in 1941, Stela 5 is composed of volcanic andesite and weighs around one-and-a-half tons.Lowe at al., p. 110. Stela 5 presents the most complex imagery of all the stelae at Izapa.Both Jacobs and Guernsey Kappelman state this, with others. Researcher Garth Norman, for example, has counted \\"at least 12\\" human figures, a dozen animals, over 25 botanical or inanimate objects, and 9 stylized deity masks. Like much of Izapan monumental sculpture, the subject matter of Stela 5 is considered mythological and religious in naturePool, p. 271. and is executed with a stylized opulence. Given the multiple overlapping scenes, it appears to be a narrative.Kulbler, p. 328. Interpretation Mesoamerican researchers identify the central image as a Mesoamerican world tree, connecting the sky above and the water or underworld below.See, for example, Guernsey Kappelman. Linda Schele and Mary Ellen Miller further propose that the stela records a creation myth, with barely formed humans emerging from a hole drilled into the tree's left side. The associated seated figures are completing these humans in various ways.Schele and Miller, p. 141. Julia Guernsey Kappelman, on the other hand, suggests the seated figures are Izapa elites conducting ritual activities in a \\"quasi-historical scene\\", which is framed by, and placed in the context of, the \\"symbolic landscape of creation\\".Guernsey, p. 124. Alternative interpretations Based on parallels with traditions originating in the Old World, a few researchers have linked the stone to theories of pre- Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Mormon theorist M. Wells Jakeman proposed that the image was a representation of a tree of life vision found in the Book of Mormon.Jakeman; Brewer, p. 12. Guernsey, p. 53, explicitly rejected this interpretation. Jakeman's theory was popular for a time among Mormons, but found little support from Mormon apologists.Brewer (1999). Clark (1999). Julia Guernsey wrote that Jakeman's research \\"belies an obvious religious agenda that ignored Izapa Stela 5's heritage\\".Guernsey (2006), p. 56. The carving was also proposed by pre-Columbian contact theorist Ivan van Sertima as supporting an African origin of the Olmecs.Van Sertima, pp.74, 101.

It was focused largely on covering extreme metal, with emphasis on the black and death metal genres. Originally a Sterling publication, it was acquired by Zenbu Media in February 2007. The magazine's editorial board was based in Manhattan, New York City, and published ten issues per year with covers on bands like Dimmu Borgir, Amon Amarth and Entombed. By contrast to its predecessor Metal Edge, which tended to feature pinups of heavy-metal stars, Metal Maniacs attempted to \\"treat kids (who were metal fans) like human beings that might possibly have something to say,\\" according to Ludwig. The magazine featured a letters section in which serious discussions about the metal scene and politics could take place. Ludwig stated, \\"I also liked to get in something about vegetarianism, hemp, feminism, and freedom of speech when I could.\\"Katherine Ludwig quoted from Ian Christe, Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal (New York: HarperCollins, 2004), pp. 249-250. In February 2009, it was announced that publisher Zenbu Media would cease publication of Metal Maniacs, along with the magazine's larger, more renowned sister publication, Metal Edge. The company did not issue a statement to its readers, nor issue any refunds for subscribers. Associate editor JJ Koczan went on to found his own online magazine, The Obelisk, in January 2009.  Digital relaunch  In 2010, the domain name of the magazine was put online again under new management from MetalHit.com. Metal Maniacs was revamped into a webzine without any involvement from its founders or previous writers.

The plant has many English names (many of them shared with Bunium bulbocastanum, a related plant with similar appearance and uses) variously including kippernut, cipernut, arnut, jarnut, hawknut, earth chestnut, groundnut, and earthnut. From its popularity with pigs come the names pignut, hognut, and more indirectly Saint Anthony's nut, for Anthony the Great or Anthony of Padua, both patron saints of swineherds. (See groundnut, earthnut, and hognut for other plants which share these names.)Hedrick. U. P. Sturtevant's Edible Plants of the World. The plant is common through much of Europe and parts of North Africa. It grows in woods and fields and is an indicator of long- established grassland. It has a smooth, slender, curving stem, up to 1 m high, much-divided leaves, and small, white flowers in many-rayed terminal compound umbels. The rounded \\"nut\\" (inconsistently described by authorities as a tuber, corm, or root) is similar to a chestnut in its brown colour and its size (up to 25 mm in diameter), and its sweet, aromatic flavour has been compared to that of the chestnut, hazelnut, sweet potato, and Brazil nut. Palatable and nutritious, its eating qualities are widely praised, and it is popular among wild food foragers, but it remains a minor crop, due in part to its low yields and difficulty of harvest.

Showboats were a special type of riverboat designed to carry passengers rather than cargo, and they had to be pushed by a small (and misleadingly labeled) towboat, also known as a pusher, which was attached to it. Showboats were rarely steam-powered because the steam engine had to be placed right in the auditorium for logistical reasons, therefore making it difficult to have a large theater. History During the American frontier era, populations of potential audiences were widely scattered about the area that is now the United States. Actors traveled to America from England, and theatre venues as well as touring companies were developed. Noah Ludlow, an early pioneer in travelling theater, purchased a keelboat in 1816 for $200 and named it Noah's Ark. Ludlow and 11 associates, together known as the American Theatrical Commonwealth Company, climbed aboard and traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, stopping to perform whenever they could. It is not clear whether they ever performed on the boat, or just used the boat as a means of travel. If they did, in fact, perform on the boat (as is probable), then Ludlow's Noah's Ark would have been the first showboat. British-born actor William Chapman, Sr. created the first deliberately-planned showboat, named the Floating Theater in Pittsburgh in 1831. He and his family of nine, along with two other people, lived on this boat and performed plays with added music and dance at stops along the waterways. The price of admission was anywhere from a peck of fresh vegetables to 50 cents a person. After reaching New Orleans, they got rid of the boat and went back to Pittsburgh in a steamboat in order to tour down the river once again the following year. In 1836, the family was able to afford a new, fully equipped steam engine with a stage. In 1837, it was renamed Steamboat Theatre. Gilbert R. Spalding's showboat The Floating Palace on the Mississippi River - Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion (1853) Many other showboats followed the Floating Theater onto the rivers in the following years, and some of them began to do other performances besides theater. One popular showboat during this period was the Floating Circus Palace of Gilbert R. Spalding and Charles J. Rogers, built in 1851, that featured large-scale equestrian spectacles. By the middle of the nineteenth century, showboats could seat up to 3,400 and regularly featured wax museums and equestrian shows. Showboats disappeared entirely with the advent of the American Civil War, but began again in 1878. Upon their revival, they tended to focus on melodrama and vaudeville. Major boats of this period included the New Sensation, New Era, Water Queen, and the Princess. New inventions such as the steamer tow and the steam calliope greatly increased both territory and audiences, and Stephen Foster‚Äôs songs added charm to their simple programs. With the improvement of roads, the rise of the automobile, motion pictures, and the maturation of the river culture, the popularity of showboats again began to decline.Sheets, Deirdre. \\"Showboats.\\" Dictionary of American History. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 22 Aug. 2016 . In order to combat this development, they grew in size and became more colorful and elaborately designed in the 1900s. The Golden Rod seated 1,400 persons; the Cotton Blossom, the Sunny South, and the New Showboat were floating theatre palaces. With the burlesquing of these programs throughout the 1930s to attract sophisticated audiences, showboats ceased to perform their original function. The last showboat to travel the rivers in authentic pattern was the Golden Rod in 1943. The glory days of showboats are recalled by the Majestic, which is docked on the Ohio River in Downtown Cincinnati. Until 2013, she served as a venue for regular performances. The Showboat Branson Belle on Table Rock Lake, Branson, Missouri. Popular culture In 1914, circus actors James Adams and his wife launched the James Adams Floating Theatre, a showboat that would tour the Chesapeake Bay and bring theatre to audiences in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. In the process of writing her 1926 novel Show Boat, Edna Ferber stayed on board the James Adams Floating Theatre to gather research material on the showboat, a disappearing American pastime. This novel served as the inspiration for the award-winning Kern and Hammerstein Broadway hit, Show Boat (1927). Since the box-office success of MGM's 1951 motion picture version of the musical Show Boat, in which the boat was inaccurately redesigned as a deluxe, self-propelled steamboat, the image of a showboat as a large twin-stacked vessel with a huge paddle wheel at the rear has taken hold in popular culture. Two earlier film versions of Show Boat and most stage productions feature a historically accurate vessel, and Edna Ferber's novel on which the musical is based gives a description of the Cotton Blossom that accurately reflects the design of a nineteenth-century showboat.\\"Smash Hit Broadway Musical Showboat Inspired by The James Adams Floating Theatre!\\" James Adams Floating Theatre. Web. 23 Jan. 2011. \\"Showboat\\" as a verb Based on the supposedly gaudy look of showboats, the term \\"showboat\\" also came to mean someone who wants his or her ostentatious behavior to be seen at all costs. This term is particularly applied in sports, where a showboat (or sometimes \\"showboater\\") will do something flashy before (or even instead of) actually achieving his or her goal. The word is also used as a verb. British television show Soccer AM has a section appropriately named Showboat, dedicated to flashy tricks from the past week's games. Oft-cited examples of showboating include Leon Lett's grocery-bag-carrying of a recovered football (which was then swatted out of his hand before the goal line) in Super Bowl XXVII; Bill Shoemaker's standing in the saddle before the finish line of the 1957 Kentucky Derby, costing him the win (some sources say he merely misjudged the finish line, with the jockey ahead of him not standing up then); Lindsey Jacobellis' grab of her snowboard which caused her to crash right before the finish of the Snowboard Cross final at the 2006 Winter Olympics, costing her a first-place finish and a gold medal (she got a silver medal instead); Usain Bolt pumping his chest before winning the 100m final at 2008 Summer Olympics, likely adding one or more tenths of a second to his world record time of 9.69 seconds; and Mario Balotelli missing a shot on (soccer) goal when he unnecessarily tried it backheel. Showboating is likely to get this sort of attention when, as a result, the contestant doing it encounters a problem in the still-in-progress competition. In boxing, showboating often takes the form of taunting, dropping one's gloves and daring an opponent to throw a punch, or engaging in other risky behaviors while the match is ongoing. Notable boxers well known for their showboating style include Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roy Jones Jr. and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Anderson Silva is a fighter in UFC notorious for showboating.

It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008.  Taxonomy  The generic name Atilax was introduced in 1826 by Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier. In 1829, Georges Cuvier referred to a mongoose in the marshes of the Cape Province using the scientific name Herpestes paludinosus. It is the only member of the genus Atilax. Characteristics The marsh mongoose's fur is dark reddish brown to black with white and fawn coloured guard hairs. The hair behind the neck and in front of the back is short, but longer on the hind legs and on the tail. Its muzzle is short with a fawn coloured mouth, short whiskers and a naked rhinarium. It has teeth. Its short ears are round. It has two nipples. Its feet have five flexible digits each with curved claws, but without any webbing. The soles of its feet are naked. Females measure in head-to-body length, and males , with a long tail. In weight, adults range from . Both sexes have anal glands in a pouch that produce a musky smelling secretion. Distribution and habitat The marsh mongoose occurs in sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia, and south to Southern Africa, except Namibia. It inhabits freshwater wetlands such as marshes and swamps along slow-moving rivers and streams, but also estuaries in coastal areas. It was probably introduced to Pemba Island in the Zanzibar Archipelago. In Guinea's National Park of Upper Niger, it was recorded during surveys conducted in 1996 to 1997. In Gabon‚Äôs Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, it was recorded only in forested habitats during a two-months survey in 2012. In the Ethiopian Highlands, it was recorded at an altitude of in Bale Mountains National Park. Behaviour and ecology The marsh mongoose is solitary. It is an excellent swimmer and can dive for up to 15 seconds, using its feet to paddle. On land, it usually trots slowly, but can also move fast. Radio-collared marsh mongooses in Kwa- Zulu Natal showed crepuscular activity, and were active from shortly after sunset until after midnight, but not during the day. A male marsh mongoose radio-collared in Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve was most active in early mornings and late evenings. During the day it rested in burrows situated in dry areas above water and mud in dense cover of high grasses and climbing plants. =Feeding behaviour and diet= Feeding behaviour of eight captive marsh mongooses was studied in 1984. When the mongooses sighted prey in the water, they swam or walked towards it, used their digits to seek it out, but kept their heads above water. Once located, they grabbed it with the mouth and killed it outside the water. They killed rodents and frogs by biting them in the head, and occasionally also shook them. When finished eating, they wiped their mouths with the forefeet. They broke eggs by throwing them backwards between the legs. Scat of marsh mongooses collected around Lake St Lucia contained foremost remains of crustaceans, amphibians, insects and fish. Marsh mongooses were observed while carrying mudcrabs (Scylla serrata) ashore. They removed the chelipeds and opened the sternum to feed on the body contents. They deposit scat at specific latrine sites located on low shrubs, on rocks or sand well away from the water edge. Scat of marsh mongoose collected in a rocky coastal habitat contained remains of sandhoppers, shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), pink-lipped topshell (Oxystele sinensis) and Tropidophora snails. Research in southeastern Nigeria revealed that the marsh mongoose has an omnivorous diet. It feeds on rodents like giant pouched rats (Cricetomys), Temminck's mouse (Mus musculoides), Tullberg's soft-furred mouse (Praomys tulbergi), grass frogs (Ptychadena), crowned bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus occipitalis), herald snake (Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia), mudskippers (Periophthalmus), insects such as spiders and Coleoptera, snails and slugs, Bivalvia, Decapoda as well as fruits, berries and seeds. =Reproduction= After a gestation of 69 to 80 days, females give birth to a litter of two to three young, which are fully furred. Their eyes open between the 9th and 14th day, pupils are bluish at first and change to brown at the age of three weeks. Their ear canal opens between the 17th and 28th day. Females start weaning their offspring earliest on the 30th day, and young are fully weaned by the age of two months. Threats In 2006, it was estimated that about 950 marsh mongooses are hunted yearly in the Cameroon part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests.

The Chicago Brass Quintet had originated the concept of a brass quintet in 1948, followed by the New York Brass Quintet in 1954. To delineate itself from these other two groundbreaking ensembles American Brass Quintet dedicated itself to \\"music originally written for brass,\\" and substituted a bass trombone for the conventional tuba voice. That debut concert for them in 1960 marked the beginning of an international career for the ensemble that includes performances in Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and all fifty of the United States; a discography now numbering fifty-one recordings; the premieres of over one hundred new brass works, and the inspiration to a whole new generation of brass quintets worldwide. ABQ commissions by Samuel Adler, Bruce Adolphe, Daniel Asia, Jan Bach, Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Elliott Carter, Billy Childs, Robert Dennis, Jacob Druckman, Eric Ewazen, Anthony Plog, Huang Ruo, David Sampson, Gunther Schuller, William Schuman, Ralph Shapey, Joan Tower, Melinda Wagner, and Charles Whittenberg are considered among the most significant contributions to the brass quintet repertoire. In the past fifteen years alone, the ABQ has released recordings of over twenty-five major new brass quintets. The presentation of challenging contemporary brass music alongside earlier eras carefully edited by ABQ members for modern performance, has become a trademark of ABQ programming, and has helped establish the American Brass Quintet as the leader in the field of serious brass chamber music today. Equally committed to the promotion of its brand of brass music through education, the American Brass Quintet has been in residence at The Juilliard School since 1987 and at the Aspen Music Festival since 1970. Many young ensembles, including the Extension Ensemble, Manhattan Brass Quintet, Meridian Arts Ensemble, and Urban Brass Quintet have worked with the ABQ through these residencies, and have gone on to establish their own presence in the brass chamber music field. Since 2001 the ABQ has offered its expertise in chamber music performance and training with a program of mini-residencies as part of its regular touring season. Designed to offer young groups and individuals an intense chamber music experience over several days, ABQ mini-residencies have been embraced by many schools and communities. Through its acclaimed performances, signature programming, large discography, and educational endeavors, the ABQ has created a formidable legacy in the brass field. Hailed as \\"the high priests of brass\\" by Newsweek, \\"positively breathtaking\\", by The New York Times, and \\"of all the brass quintets, this country's most distinguished\\" by the American Record Guide, the American Brass Quintet has clearly defined itself among the elite chamber music ensembles of our time. The American Brass Quintet is the 2013 recipient of Chamber Music America's highest honor, the Richard J. Bogomolny National Service Award for significant and lasting contributions to the field. The current ABQ consists of Louis Hanzlik and Kevin Cobb on trumpet, Eric Reed on French horn, Michael Powell on tenor trombone, and John Rojak on bass trombone.

Other nearby towns include Wells and the historic destination of Barkerville. Once a popular hunting and fishing destination, today the park is protected and known for its abundant wildlife, rugged glaciated mountains, and numerous freshwater lakes. The park's standout attraction is the recreational paddling circuit through the Cariboo Mountains, which connects a majority of the park's lakes via waterways and short portages, and has been named by Outside magazine as one of the top 10 canoe trips in the world. The park is open to a limited number of canoes and kayaks each year from May 15 to September 30. History = Indigenous use = Many Aboriginal Canadians frequented the area that is now Bowron Lake Provincial Park before European settlement. Early settlers reported encounters with natives, who were seen hunting, trapping, fishing, and gathering in the area. Accounts vary in terms of which specific groups these natives belonged to: some settlers speculated these were the Carrier people, while others suggested they were Shuswap or Iroquois. A 100-person village existed on Bear Lake (later known as Bowron Lake), but the village site sloughed into the lake in 1964, due to naturally occurring mudslides or possibly from seismic shock resulting from the 1964 Anchorage earthquake. By that time, however, the village was uninhabited. It is likely that its prior inhabitants had been wiped out by disease, as the First Nations of the area were deeply impacted by the smallpox epidemics of the 1860s. The loss of the site prevented any form of carbon-dating to determine its true age. While very little formal archaeological work has been done, a large number of indigenous artifacts have been seen in the park, including clam middens, old campfires, arrowheads, and cache pits. As a lingering reminder of the First Nation presence in the area, many of the landmarks and features in and around the park have indigenous names, particularly in the Carrier language. Some examples are Mount Ishpa (Carrier for \\"my father\\"), Kaza (\\"arrow\\") Mountain, the Itzul (\\"forest\\") Range, the Tediko (\\"girls\\") Range, and Lanezi (\\"long\\") Lake. = Gold rush era = The town of Barkerville was the de facto base of operations for most prospectors exploring the Bowron Lake chain during the Cariboo gold rush era. The first major arrival of European settlers in the area around Bowron Lake Park came with the Cariboo gold rush in the 1860s, which was centred in the nearby town of Barkerville. While little gold mining happened within the modern boundaries of the park, miners and prospectors were the first Europeans to regularly visit Bowron Lake (then called Bear Lake) and the surrounding area. The Bowron and Cariboo mountains were continuously explored through the mid- to late-1800s. While the Canadian Pacific Railway searched for links through the mountain passes, John Bowron, the Gold Commissioner, sent exploration parties into the hills to establish mining routes into gold-bearing ground. One of these routes followed the Goat River pass, connecting the Cariboo region to the T√™te Jaune Cache in the Robson Valley, and was well-established enough to allow for dog sleds in the winter. This trail was eventually made obsolete when the Grand Trunk Railroad was finalized in 1914. On 31 March 1917, Bowron Lake was adopted as the official name of the lake previously known as Bear Lake, to honour John Bowron ‚Äì though some maps had started using this name as early as 1914. John Bowron himself died in 1906, and was extremely involved with the mining industry in Barkerville throughout his life. The park would later inherit the same name as the lake.Wright (1985) pp. 35-36 = Settlement and establishment as a park = While the bulk of the initial non-native population arrived with the gold rush, the area enjoyed a modest but steady influx of settlers throughout the late 19th to early 20th centuries, even as the gold rush ended. Land grants were given to soldiers returning from the First World War, and many families arrived to start farms. With the end of the gold rush, trapping and hunting came to the forefront of the region's economy. While fish and game had fed miners for years, as the turn of the century arrived, the focus shifted from hunting for sustenance to sport hunting. Wilderness guides arrived in the area and attracted an ever-increasing influx of big game hunters looking to take advantage of what was called a \\"hunter's paradise\\" in the quadrangle of lakes that now make up the park. The most prominent of these guides, Frank Kibbee, started setting up trap lines in the area in 1900 and built a home on the shores of Bowron Lake in 1907.Wright (1985) p. 39 He was the longest-operating and most renowned guide in the region, and one of the lakes in the chain ‚Äì Kibbee Lake ‚Äì is today named after him. In the 1920s, as concerns were raised about stress on the wildlife population in the Cariboo mountains, the idea was proposed to turn the area within the Bowron lake quadrangle into a game reserve, citing the success of Yellowstone in the United States. The proposed reserve would be a hunting-free sanctuary where animals could breed without human interference, allowing the population to stabilize. This was widely supported by naturalists such as Thomas and Elinor McCabe, who had arrived in 1922 and built a home on Indianpoint Lake, and Allan Brooks, as well as wilderness guides like the aforementioned Frank Kibbee and Joe Wendle. Despite some initial resistance from residents of Barkerville, the case was made that establishment of the reserve would have lasting economic benefits, through the management of game to sustain the hunting industry. The Bowron Lakes Game Reserve was established by the provincial government in 1925 and Frank Kibbee was named the reserve's first game warden shortly afterwards. The reserve was originally in size, although many additions have been made to the reserve (and later, park) in the years since. In the 1950s and 1960s, the cultural focus of British Columbia's protected areas shifted from game management to conservation. As a result, in 1961 the Bowron Lakes Game Reserve was changed to Bowron Lake Provincial park, and the park received its largest land increases with the addition of the Betty Wendle and Wolverine drainage systems and parts of the upper Cariboo River. The enthusiasm for the Bowron Region to be purely a wilderness area was so strong that most signs of human habitation were destroyed shortly after the provincial park was declared, including rail portages, trappers' cabins, and many other signs of human development. Even the home of Thomas and Elinor McCabe, at Indianpoint Lake, was burned down, in what was described by author and guide Richard Thomas Wright as \\"a moment of pyromaniac enthusiasm to return the land to wilderness\\".  Geography and geology  Quesnel Highlands, which make up the northwest portion of the park.299x299px Bowron Lake Provincial park is located in the Cariboo Mountains, in central British Columbia. It is roughly 120 km (75 mi) east of the city of Quesnel, and just under 30 km (18 mi) east of the town of Wells. The park is composed of of protected wilderness, featuring many lakes and rivers nestled in mountains. This protected area is further expanded to the south, as the park shares a border with Cariboo Mountains Provincial Park, which itself shares a border with Wells Gray Provincial Park. Together, the three parks protect over of wilderness. Bowron Lake Park contains three main groups of rock. The oldest is known as the Kaza Group, which is made up of mud and sand deposits that formed during the Precambrian period 600 million years ago, in a sea at the continental margin of what is now the Canadian Shield. The second group of rock, known today as the Cariboo Group, was formed 440 to 600 million years ago in the Cambrian period, when materials from the continental land mass were eroded by changing conditions in the sea. The third and youngest group, formed about 250 million years ago, is made up of sedimentary of volcanic rocks, parts of which today are exposed in various parts of the park. This third group is known as the Slide Mountain Group. 300x300px Most of the visible geological features of the park were formed during mountain-building processes that started about 100 million years after the sedimentary and volcanic material was deposited. This process formed the Quesnel highlands, to the northwest of the park, and the more rugged Cariboo Mountains to the southeast of the park. Both mountain groups were largely shaped in the Cretaceous period, alongside most of British Columbia's modern drainage channels. This continued into the Eocene, until roughly 25,000 years ago when the area was covered in a 2,000-metre ice sheet. The sheet was largely static at its center over the Cariboo Mountains, resulting in the sharp features and rugged peaks that characterize the Cariboo Range. The ice covering the Quesnel Highlands, however, was much more mobile, grinding the rock down and forming broad and rounded mountains with summits between ‚Äì more subdued than the summits of the Cariboo Mountains, most of which are over 2,100 meters. 12,000 years ago, the glaciers in the area retreated, forming the park as it exists today. Glacial till remains visible in many areas of the park, and some small glaciers still exist in its higher slopes. The retreat of the glaciers formed the park's main sequence of lakes in a roughly quadrilateral arrangement, as viewed from space. Some examples include Indianpoint lake, formed when water from the Cariboo river was diverted by a blockage into the Indianpoint Valley, Unna Lake, which was formed from a melting kettle, and Sandy Lake and Spectacle lake, which were formed partially by meltwater streams.  Ecology  = Flora = The park spans sub-alpine and alpine ecosystems, and therefore contains the characteristic plants of those zones. The predominant trees are spruce and balsam, with fir (both subalpine and Douglas), cedar, and hemlock also present in various areas. For the most part, the park consists of old-growth forests, with the exception of a few areas that were burned by wildfires in the recent past. Below the tree canopy, the park is home to numerous shrubs and berry plants, which include but are not limited to twinberry, false box, bearberry, Labrador tea, cranberry, huckleberry, mountain ash, red-osier dogwood, soopolallie, white rhododendron, and sticky currant, among others. The park is also host to a very wide array of flowers. = Fauna = 386x386px Having started as a game reserve, the park is frequented by a diverse selection of animals. Moose are very common in the aquatic environments around the lakes, and mule deer are often seen in the area around Unna Lake in particular. Other large mammals such as mountain goats and caribou inhabit the park's alpine regions. The park's population of smaller mammals include semiaquatic mammals like beaver, muskrat, and river otter, as well as members of the weasel family including mink, fisher, marten, stoat, least weasel, and long-tailed weasel. Small land- dwelling mammals in the park include various voles and mice, foxes, hares, coyotes, porcupines, skunks, and squirrels. Bears are quite common in the park ‚Äì black bears are numerous in the lower altitudes around the lake, and grizzly bears frequent the alpine areas. In addition to its bears, Bowron Lake Park is home to predators like cougars, wolves, wolverines, and lynx. Due to its size, the park covers several habitats and therefore contains an immense variety of birds. Notable examples include Canada jays and ravens, which have adapted to human presence and often approach campsites in search of food, and waterfowl such as the loon, whose calls are commonly heard throughout the park. Swans winter on Sandy Lake, and both Canada geese and snow geese stop in the park during their migrations. Various predatory birds, such as osprey, can often be seen fishing on the lake's waters. Many species of fish swim in the lakes themselves. Rainbow trout, dolly varden, kokanee, and rocky mountain whitefish inhabit most of the lakes year-round. Sockeye and chinook migrate through the Bowron Lake and River during their spawning runs. Sockeye typically arrive to spawn in the upper Bowron River around August, peaking during the start of September, while chinook actually spawn outside the park's grounds, in the lower Bowron River.  Conservation  = Fire = As in many BC parks, forest fires in Bowron Lake Park are treated as a natural process of forest rejuvenation. As such, natural fires that start in the park are generally allowed to burn, provided that they do not pose a risk to the safety of the park's users and facilities. The climate of the park can vary significantly throughout its various biogeoclimatic zones, and some areas can be significantly warmer and drier than others (for example, the Northwest portions of the park). Since they are more difficult to control, fires that start in those areas are typically not allowed to burn. = Beetle infestations = The central plateau of British Columbia, where Bowron Lake Park resides, has historically been victim to infestations of mountain pine beetle, which can kill large areas of tree forest if not controlled. Steps are being taken to control the spread of the beetle in Bowron Lake Park, using strategies such as the burning of affected trees, using trap trees (which are later felled and burned) to attract beetles, pheromone baiting (attractant pheromones for trap trees, or anti-aggregation pheromones for healthy trees), and biocontrol sprays. These control strategies are only used in zones of the park where beetle impact is expected to be severe; otherwise, the natural processes involving the beetles are allowed to continue unimpeded. = Wildlife and fisheries = Bowron Lake Park, in conjunction with Wells Gray, Cariboo Mountain, and Cariboo River parks, form a large contiguous protected area, which acts as a haven for a wide variety of animals and wildlife. This is particularly beneficial for creatures that require large areas of undisturbed habitat, such as the grizzly bear. The park's undeveloped wilderness provides a habitat and food source for animals such as mountain caribou, which feed off arboreal lichens that grow in the park's old growth forests. While Caribou are migratory animals, there are a number of herds that pass through the park regularly. The park is also home to an estimated three packs of wolves, who tend to feed off the park's numerous and stable population of moose. Populations of these and several other species are monitored to ensure stable populations and to maintain a healthy biodiversity in the park. The high number of watersheds in the park make it a suitable environment for fish, and many species are widely distributed throughout its waterways. The park acts as a spawning ground for several species of trout, salmon, and others. Special regulations and limitations are applied to fishing within the park to maintain a healthy population of fish.  Recreation  = Paddling = Paddling is by far the most popular recreational activity in Bowron Lake Provincial Park. The most popular recreational activity in the park is paddling in a canoe or kayak, due to the world-renowned paddling circuit formed by its uniquely linked chain of lakes. The Bowron Lake canoe circuit has been highly rated by Outside magazine, Popular Science, Field & Stream, and others. The circuit spans a total of 116 km and connects almost all of the park's lakes via waterways or short portages on man-made trails. In addition to views of the surrounding mountains and lakes, the circuit provides excellent wildlife viewing opportunities: moose, deer, bear, coyote, fox, beaver, songbirds, waterfowl, and small mammals are all commonly seen by paddlers. Typical paddling time for the full circuit ranges from 6 to 10 days. Alternatively, the west side of the circuit, between Bowron Lake and Unna Lake, can be paddled on its own in 2 to 4 days. The full circuit can only be paddled in one direction, starting with a portage to Kibee Lake, and ending at the northeast shore of Bowron Lake. Paddlers camp at designated campsites along the circuit, typically in tents - some campsites have cabins, but they are intended for drying wet gear or for sleeping in emergencies. Regulations are in place to limit party size, as well as the number of daily entries into the circuit. Since human visitation has a significant impact on the park, a number of other rules and restrictions have been established, all of which contribute to conservation efforts and/or help maintain the isolated wilderness experience in the circuit. These include: * Bear proof caches (available at each campsite) must be used for storing anything that may attract a bear. * Cans, bottles, glass jars, and all other commercially packaged beverage and glass containers are prohibited on the circuit. * Any music players with externals speakers are prohibited on the circuit. * No dogs or pets may enter the circuit. * Powered watercraft are not allowed on the circuit, with the exception of Bowron Lake. Additionally, anyone entering the circuit must take part in a mandatory orientation session to familiarize themselves with the rules and to prepare themselves for the circuit's challenges. = Hiking = While hiking in Bowron Lake Park is much less prominent than paddling, there are three dedicated hiking trails in the park: * Harold falls (0.5 km) * Cariboo Falls (3 km)Rainbow Trout are one of the lake fish commonly caught in Bowron Lake Provincial Park. * Hunter Lake (2 km) There are also several portage trails connecting various lakes and waterways, but they are primarily intended for transporting canoes and kayaks. = Fishing = Fishing is allowed in the park as long as it is done in accordance with BC fishing regulations. Bull trout, kokanee, rainbow trout, and lake trout can be caught at various points in the lakes, with the best fishing occurring in the months of June and September. = Winter use = The lakes can be crossed when frozen during the winter months. There are no set tracks, but the portage trails can be used in order to complete the whole circuit in skis or snowshoes.

Bridgman was left deaf-blind at the age of two after contracting scarlet fever. She was educated at the Perkins Institution for the Blind where, under the direction of Samuel Gridley Howe, she learned to read and communicate using Braille and the manual alphabet developed by Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e. For several years, Bridgman gained celebrity status when Charles Dickens met her during his 1842 American tour and wrote about her accomplishments in his American Notes. Her fame was short-lived, however, and she spent the remainder of her life in relative obscurity, most of it at the Perkins Institute, where she passed her time sewing and reading books in Braille. Early years Laura Bridgman was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, the third daughter of Daniel Bridgman, a Baptist farmer, and his wife Harmony, daughter of Cushman Downer, and granddaughter of Joseph Downer, one of the five first settlers (1761) of Thetford, Vermont. Laura was a delicate infant, small and rickety, and suffered from convulsions until she was eighteen months old.Freeberg, Ernest. The Education of Laura Bridgman: First Deaf and Blind Person to Learn Language.Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2001, p. 13. Her family was struck with scarlet fever when Laura was two years old. The illness killed her two older sisters and left her deaf, blind, and without a sense of smell or taste.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 14. Though she gradually recovered her health, she remained deaf and blind. Laura's mother kept her well-groomed and showed the child affection, but Laura received little attention from the rest of her family, including her father who, on occasion, tried to \\"frighten her into obedience\\" by stamping his foot hard on the floor to startle her with the vibrations.Gitter, Elisabeth. The Imprisoned Guest: Samuel Howe and Laura Bridgman, the Original Deaf-Blind Girl. NY: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2001, p. 48. Her closest friend was a kind, mentally impaired hired man of the Bridgmans, Asa Tenney, whom she credited with making her childhood happy. Tenney had some kind of expressive language disorder himself, and communicated with Laura in signs. He knew Native Americans who used a sign language (probably Abenaki using Plains Indian Sign Language), and had begun to teach Laura to express herself using these signs when she was sent away to school.\\"The indain[sic] chief that I have seen in this village when the younger Indian spoke of talking by signs, said the chief held the opinion there was one language that was universal, and he could talk that language. Laura was improving in that very language as well as knitting work before leaving home.\\" Asa Tenney in a letter to Samuel Gridley Howe, September 17, 1839. In The Imprisoned Guest: Samuel Howe and Laura Bridgman, The Original Deaf-Blind Girl by Elizabeth Gitter (Picador, 2002), p. 54. Education at the Perkins School Bridgman circa 1855. Daguerreotype by Southworth & Hawes In 1837, James Barrett of Dartmouth College saw Bridgman and mentioned her case to Dr. Reuben Mussey, the head of the medical department. Mussey visited the Bridgman home and found Laura an affectionate and intelligent girl who, despite her severe disabilities, could perform basic household tasks such as sewing and setting the table.Gitter, p. 66. Mussey sent an account to Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, the director of the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston, who was eager to educate the young Bridgman,Gitter, p. 67. who entered the school on October 12, 1837, two months before her eighth birthday.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 29.Gitter, p. 78. Bridgman was frightened and homesick at first, but she soon formed an attachment to the house matron, Miss Lydia Hall Drew (1815-1887), who was also her first instructor at the school.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 29. Howe had recently met Julia Brace, a deaf-blind resident at the American School for the Deaf who communicated by using a series of primitive signs; however, her instructors had failed to teach her more advanced methods of communication, such as adapted forms of tactile sign.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 26. Howe developed a plan to teach Bridgman to read and write through tactile means ‚Äî something that had not been attempted previously, to his knowledge. Howe's plan was based on the theories of the French philosopher Denis Diderot, who believed the sense of touch could develop its \\"own medium of symbolic language.\\"Freeberg, Ernest, p. 34. At first he and his assistant, Lydia Hall Drew, used words printed with raised letters, and later they progressed to using a manual alphabet expressed through mapping the English alphabet on to points and tracing motions on the palm of the hand. Eventually she received a broad education. Howe taught Bridgman words before the individual letters. His first experiment consisted of pasting paper labels upon several common articles such as keys, spoons, and knives, with the names of the articles printed in raised letters. He then had her feel the labels by themselves, and she learned to associate the raised letters with the articles to which they referred. Eventually, she could find the right label for each object from a mixed heap. The next stage was to give her the individual letters and teach her to combine them to spell the words she knew. Gradually, in this way, she learned the alphabet and the ten digits. The whole process showed that she had human intelligence, which only required stimulation, and her own interest in learning became keener as she progressed.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 36. Howe devoted himself to Bridgman's education and was rewarded with increasing success. On July 24, 1839 she first wrote her own name legibly. On June 20, 1840 she had her first arithmetic lesson, with the aid of a metallic case perforated with square holes, square types being used; and in nineteen days she could add a column of figures amounting to thirty. She was in good health and happy, and was treated as a daughter by Howe. She lived in the director's apartment with Howe and his sister, Jeannette Howe, until Howe married Julia Ward in 1843.Gitter, Elisabeth. The Imprisoned Guest: Samuel Howe and Laura Bridgman. NY: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2001, p. 151. Her case already began to interest the public, and others were brought to Dr. Howe for treatment. Fame From the beginning of his work with Bridgman, Howe sent accounts of her progress and his teaching strategies to European journals, which were \\"read by thousands.\\"Freeberg, Ernest, p. 52. In January 1842 Charles Dickens visited the Institution, and afterwards wrote enthusiastically in his American Notes of Howe's success with Bridgman. Dickens quotes Howe's account of Bridgman's education: > Her social feelings, and her affections, are very strong; and when she is > sitting at work, or by the side of one of her little friends, she will break > off from her task every few moments, to hug and kiss them with an > earnestness and warmth that is touching to behold. When left alone, she > occupies and apparently amuses herself, and seems quite content; and so > strong seems to be the natural tendency of thought to put on the garb of > language, that she often soliloquizes in the finger language, slow and > tedious as it is. But it is only when alone, that she is quiet; for if she > becomes sensible of the presence of any one near her, she is restless until > she can sit close beside them, hold their hand, and converse with them by > sign.Dickens, Charles. American Notes. Cambridge: CSP Classic Texts, 2008, > p. 32. Following the publication of Dickens's book, Bridgman became world famous. Thousands of people visited her at the Perkins School, \\"asked for keepsakes, followed her in the newspapers, and read paeans to her in evangelical journals and ladies' magazines\\".Gitter, p. 124. On Saturdays, the school was open to the public. Crowds gathered to watch Laura read and point out locations on a map with raised letters. Laura became \\"very much excited\\" by these events, but her teachers were concerned because Laura knew she drew more attention than the other students.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 60. In the late 1840s, Howe said that \\"perhaps there are not three living women whose names are more widely known than Laura Bridgman's; and there is not one who has excited so much sympathy and interest.\\"quoted in Freeberg, Ernest, p. 64 Teenage years Bridgman suffered a series of emotional losses during her teenage years and early twenties. In 1841, Lydia Drew, Laura's first teacher at the Perkins School, left her teaching position to marry. Drew was replaced by Mary Swift, an excellent teacher, though not as openly affectionate with Bridgman as Drew had been.Gitter, p. 151. Swift also attempted to instill Bridgman with her Congregationalist religious views in direct defiance of Howe's New England Unitarianism.Gitter, p. 163. An even more devastating loss occurred in May 1843 when Howe married Julia Ward, a woman 18 years his junior. Howe had treated Bridgman as a daughter, and she had loved him as a father. She was depressed by the lengthy separation following the marriage‚Äîthe Howes' honeymoon in Europe lasted 15 months‚Äîand worried that Howe would no longer love her now that he had taken a wife.Gitter, p. 158. Bridgman's fears were realized when the couple returned from their honeymoon in August 1844. Howe had lost interest in Bridgman, though he had made provisions for her to have a home at the school for life.Gitter, p. 175. Bridgman never developed a close relationship with Julia Ward Howe who, according to her daughters, had a \\"physical distaste for the abnormal and defective\\" and a \\"natural shrinking from the blind and other defectives with whom she was often thrown\\" following her marriage to Howe.Richards, Laura, Maud Howe Elliott and Florence Howe Hall. Julia Ward Howe. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1915, p. 105. Mary Swift left the school in May, 1845 to get married, leaving Bridgman without any instruction for several months.Gitter, p. 190. Bridgman's next teacher, Sarah Wight, compensated for many of the losses Bridgman had suffered in recent years. A gentle, religious, outwardly timid young woman to whom Bridgman was immediately drawn, Wight taught Bridgman the traditional academic subjects ‚Äî mathematics, history, geography ‚Äî but she also set aside plenty of time for the two of them to engage in \\"finger\\" conversations, one of the activities Bridgman liked best.Gitter, p. 200. While Wight cared deeply for Bridgman, she also felt that, because of her \\"celebrity\\" status, the girl enjoyed privileges denied to other students.Gitter, p. 201. Bridgman had a private room, and she rarely mingled with the other students unless they paid her \\"particular attention\\".Gitter, p. 201. Wight also saw that Bridgman could be willful and irritable, behavior characteristics that required discipline.Gitter, p. 202. Bridgman could also be emotionally demanding of her young teacher, becoming peevish and short-tempered whenever Wight wanted some time alone.Gitter, p. 207. In 1845 at the age of sixteen, Bridgman developed anorexia, her weight falling from 113 pounds to 79 pounds.Gitter,. p. 207. Howe rightly surmised that Bridgman was \\"reacting to the many abandonments and losses she had endured,\\"Gitter, p. 210. and he proposed that she pay a visit to her family, with whom she had had little contact in recent years. Accompanied by Wight, Bridgman traveled to her family's New Hampshire farm in June 1846. She particularly enjoyed being reunited with her mother, sisters Mary and Collina, and brother Addison, who was able to communicate with Bridgman in sign language. She was also reunited with her old friend Asa Tenney, who visited her frequently during her two-week stay.Gitter, p. 211. Though Bridgman resumed eating, her often obstinate and temperamental behavior persisted; this troubled Wight, who understood that few people would endure such conduct in a grown woman.Gitter, p. 213. Wight left the Perkins School in November 1850, having spent five years as Bridgman's teacher and companion.Gitter, p. 220. Wight was engaged to a Unitarian missionary, George Bond, and following their marriage, the couple planned to travel to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii).Gitter, p. 220. Bridgman begged to go along as Wight's housekeeper but, ultimately, Wight went without her, leaving Bridgman with no friend, companion or teacher to console her.Gitter, p. 223. Religion With no outward sources of consolation, Bridgman turned inward to prayer and meditation.Gitter, p. 245. She eventually embraced her family's Baptist religion and was baptized in July 1852.Gitter, p. 246. She began occasionally to write devotional poems, of which \\"Holy Home\\" is the best known: Heaven is holy home. Holy Home is from ever lasting to ever lasting. Holy home is Summery. Holy home shall endure forever...quoted in Gitter, p. 253. Bridgman feared death, but she saw heaven as a \\"place where these fears might at last be laid to rest\\".Freeberg, p. 153. Adult years Bridgman's formal education ended when Wight left the school in 1850.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 205. She returned to New Hampshire and, for a time, she enjoyed being reunited with her family; however, she was homesick for the school and her anorexia eventually returned.Freeberg, Ernest, p. 209. When Howe learned that Bridgman's health was rapidly deteriorating, he sent a teacher, Mary Paddock, to the Bridgman home to take his former student back to the school.Freeberg, p. 209. Bridgman's health gradually improved, and though she received occasional visitors, she was now largely forgotten by the public.Gitter, p. 229. She occupied herself by writing letters to her mother and a few friends ‚Äî Bridgman kept in touch with both Mary Swift and Sarah Wight ‚Äî sewing, reading the Bible in braille, and keeping her room fastidiously clean. She earned a little spending money, about $100 a year, from selling her crocheted doilies, purses, and embroidered handkerchiefs,Freeberg, p. 206. but she was primarily dependent upon the school to supply her with room and board. Bridgman lived a relatively quiet and uneventful life at the school. She never became a full-time teacher, but she did assist the young blind girls in their sewing classes where she was considered a \\"patient but demanding instructor.\\"Freeberg, p. 210. In 1872, several cottages (each under a matron) for the blind girls were added to the Perkins campus, and Bridgman was moved from the larger house of the Institution into one of them. Bridgman, always eager for someone to communicate with in sign language, befriended Anne Sullivan when they shared a cottage in the early 1880s.Gitter, p. 280. The death of Howe in 1876 was a great grief to her; but before he died he had made arrangements ensuring her financial security at the school for the rest of her life. In 1887 her jubilee was celebrated there, but in 1889 she was taken ill, and she died on May 24. She was buried at Dana Cemetery in Hanover, New Hampshire near her family's farm.Gitter, p. 284.  Legacy  Bridgman became famous in her youth as an example of the education of a deaf-blind person. Helen Keller's mother, Kate Keller, read Dickens's account in American Notes and was inspired to seek advice which led to her hiring a teacher and former pupil of the same school, Anne Sullivan. Sullivan learned the manual alphabet at the Perkins Institution which she took back to Helen, along with a doll wearing clothing that Bridgman had sewn herself.Gitter, p. 281. Bridgman's case is mentioned in La Symphonie Pastorale by Andr√© Gide. A Liberty ship was named after her. In 2014, a fictional account of the life of Bridgman, What Is Visible by Kimberly Elkins, was published.Barbara Kingsolver, \\"An Inner Life: 'What Is Visible,' by Kimberly Elkins\\", The New York Times, June 5, 2014.

Cleghorne was the sketch comedy show's second African-American female repertory cast member, succeeding Danitra Vance in its eleventh season, and the first African-American female cast member to stay for more than one season. She returned for its 40th anniversary special on February 15, 2015. Cleghorne was ranked the 69th greatest Saturday Night Live cast member by Rolling Stone magazine. Life and career A native of the Red Hook Projects in Brooklyn, New York, Cleghorne is a graduate of Hunter College. She first established her talents in New York City comedy clubs and career started when she competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 where she was directed in a video by Saturday Night Live short film producer Neal Marshad at the comedy club Caroline's in the South Street Seaport. In 1991, she appeared on Def Comedy Jam and landed minor roles in season two of In Living Color, where she was discovered by producers of Saturday Night Live. Cleghorne joined Saturday Night Live in 1991, and remained on the show for four seasons until 1995. During her tenure she performed impressions such as Alfre Woodard, Dr. Dre, Anita Baker, Florence Griffith Joyner, Debbie Allen, Mary J. Blige, Natalie Cole, Patti LaBelle, Marla Gibbs, Robin Quivers, Toni Morrison, Joycelyn Elders, Tina Turner, and Whoopi Goldberg. She also had two recurring characters: Zoraida, an NBC page, and Queen Shenequa, who appeared frequently on the recurring Weekend Update sketch. Cleghorne was the third black woman to be credited on Saturday Night Live, after Yvonne Hudson and Danitra Vance, and the first woman of color to appear on the series as a full-fledged cast member for longer than a single season. She later said, \\"I was the first [woman of color] cast member ... with a contract. And if you read, or do research, they didn't used to give black people contracts on SNL. That was cold-blooded. They didn't even give them credit. The credits roll, your name's not even on there. That was a joke because that's how you got residuals.\\" Her former Saturday Night Live costar Jay Mohr's book Gasping for Airtime notes that Cleghorne did not get along well with some of the other cast members during her time on the show. He also mentions a tiff with host Sally Field during a pitch meeting. In 1995, Cleghorne left SNL to star as single mother Ellen Carlson on Cleghorne!, a sitcom that aired for one season on The WB network, and which also starred former SNL alumnus Garrett Morris, and Sherri Shepherd in her first acting role. Cleghorne later said, \\"I don't think I was ready. In terms of being strong and saying, 'I can write, this is what I do,' and feel confident in that. And to be able to say, 'No, this does not work, this works better.'\\" In 1993 and 1994, Cleghorne made appearances on the Nickelodeon children's TV show The Adventures of Pete and Pete playing a bus driver who served as the love interest of Pete's regular bus driver. She later appeared in independent films and comedy segments including Armageddon (1998), Coyote Ugly (2000), Little Nicky (2000), and Old School (2003). She has also had a series of skits played on Sirius XM Radio's Raw Dog Comedy channel. Cleghorne was mentioned on a segment of the Family Guy DVD Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, when Stewie asks if \\"they ever found a suitable vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne.\\" Seth MacFarlane claimed that she called the show's staff about the joke, which Cleghorne has denied. In 2013, Cleghorne appeared in a small role in Grown Ups 2. In 2014 she received her PhD in Performance Studies at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. In 2015, Cleghorne was one of the contestants for Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition, finishing in 3rd place. The same year she appeared in the 40th anniversary special of Saturday Night Live, calling the experience \\"a cleansing\\". In 2018, she played the role of Shaniqua in Second Act.

Life In A.H. 78 (697-698 CE) al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the Caliphate's viceroy of the eastern provinces, appointed Yazid's father al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra as governor of Khurasan. In A.H. 82 (701-702) al-Muhallab's son Mughira died and al-Muhallab sent Yazid to replace him. Soon afterwards al-Muhallab died and al-Hajjaj appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan. There Yazid confronted external and internal enemies, including some rebels entering his province who were supporters of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. Yazid defeated them. Yazid seized Nizak's fortress and made peace with him. In A.H. 85 (704-705) al-Hajjaj replaced Yazid naming his younger brother al-Mufaddal governor of Khurasan. Various reasons are suggested, including that al-Hajjaj encountered a prophecy that his successor would be named Yazid and al-Hajjaj considered this Yazid the only one threatening enough to worry about. Al-Hajjaj imprisoned and tortured Yazid. In A.H. 90 (708-709) Yazid disguised escaped and made his way to Palestine where he was granted refuge by Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. Al-Hajjaj pressed Caliph al-Walid I who commanded his brother to send him Yazid in chains. Suleiman had his own son chained to Yazid approach the caliph and speak favouring Yazid's safety. Al-Walid accepted this and told al-Hajjaj to desist. Yazid returned to Sulayman and the two were very close to each other. When Sulayman came to the throne in A.H. 96 (715), he appointed Yazid to govern Iraq. The next year Sulayman appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan. Yazid fought in Jurjan and Tabaristan, personally engaging in combat. In A.H. 99 (717-718) the new caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz dismissed Yazid due to his tortures against people of conquered territories, especially Turks and Sogds. Yazid was captured on his way to Basra and brought before Umar who intensely disliked him. Umar imprisoned Yazid. In A.H. 101 (719-720) when Umar fell ill, Yazid escaped. Umar died. Yazid approached Basra. Many joined him. He refused to swear allegiance to the new caliph, Yazid II. He attacked those holding his brothers, defeated them and freed his brothers. His son Khalid was arrested in Kufa and sent to Damascus where he remained in prison until he died. Yazid was advised to head east, but he declined to follow this advice. In A.H. 102 (720-721) Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik and al-Abbas ibn al-Walid led forces against him. On August 25, Maslama's troops advanced to battle, frightening some of Yazid's men who fled. Yazid had these beheaded. He then rode directly at Maslama. Maslama's cavalry intercepted him and cut him down. Fighting continued. In Wasit, Yazid's son Mu'awiya on news of his father's death executed some prisoners, including Adi ibn Artat, the Basran governor who had sent Yazid to Umar in A.H. 99. Mu'awiya and other surviving members of the Yazid's family sailed to Bahrayn, then near Kirman. They advanced to Qandabil where they were denied entrance. There was a glorious fight in which all but two died, those two making their way to Zabulistan. Some captured boys were sent to Yazid II who beheaded them.

They are referred to as a side project of Shawn Crahan, a member/founder of heavy metal band Slipknot. In 2003 they released their debut album To My Surprise, however after losing frontman Brandon Darner in 2004 they parted ways with their record label. 2005 saw four new members join the band to begin work on a second album and in 2006 they began performing shows in the US. However, shortly after To My Surprise canceled several upcoming appearances and disbanded without releasing a second album. History In June 2002, Shawn Crahan, Brandon Darner and Steven Robinson began working on an album together. During an interview with MTV in 2003 Crahan explained; \\"I've been keeping in touch with the music side of myself,\\" and that To My Surprise is \\"a movement towards understanding [himself] and who [he is].\\" Two songs that Crahan and Darner wrote in 2002 were sent to producer Rick Rubin, without the intent of working with him. However, Rubin invited the band to Cello Studios in Los Angeles to work on an album. On October 7, 2003, the band released their debut album To My Surprise through Roadrunner Records. A music video for the track \\"In The Mood\\" premiered on MTV's Extreme show on December 1. In 2004 \\"Get It To Go\\" featured on the soundtrack for the video game MVP Baseball 2004. Also in 2004, Crahan began working with Slipknot again in preparation of the release of their third album. At this time vocalist Darner was‚Äîas Crahan describes it‚Äî\\"at an age where he was ready to start his career\\" but Crahan had other commitments with Slipknot and Darner decided to leave To My Surprise. Shortly after this, with only releasing one album by the band, Roadrunner Records parted ways with To My Surprise. In 2005‚Äîafter Slipknot had finished touring‚ÄîCrahan and Robinson got back together to work on new material, enlisting the help of Dorothy Hecht, Jarrod Brom, Paul Thompson, Wade Thompson and Patrick McBride making the band twice its original size. The band were working on a second album which they planned to release through Crahan's own label Big Orange Clown Records. In 2006 it was announced that the band would release a limited edition 7\\" record, however the band began performing shows and this brought a halt to work in the studio. Most notably To My Surprise performed at South by Southwest, which Crahan described as \\"a dream come true\\". Prior to their performance at South by Southwest a track entitled \\"Jump The Gun\\" was released online as part of an e-card. They also planned to perform at festivals in Europe and tour the US, however the band canceled their appearances at European festivals and parted ways. Crahan said that the reason the band \\"died\\" was because it was unrealistic for him to be in this band and make it work and that \\"Slipknot made it impossible\\". Musical style To My Surprise found its name from people's reaction to their music, primarily based on peoples prejudice based on Crahan's most notable band Slipknot's musical style. Crahan went as far as saying \\"I'd have to put a gun in my mouth if it was metal,\\" because he's already in \\"the best metal band in the world\\". Their musical style has been noted to include; glam rock, new wave, pop, country rock, alternative rock and disco. They have been compared to Cake, The Strokes, Faith No More, Weezer, Syd Barrett, They Might Be Giants, Hater, The Presidents of the United States of America and Harvey Danger, among others.

Named after Charles G. McCawley, eighth Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, she was the lead ship in her class. The second McCawley, formerly SS Santa Barbara, was completed in 1928 by the Furness Shipbuilding Company of Haverton Hill-on-Tees, England; she was acquired by the Navy from Grace Lines 26 July 1940, and renamed McCawley (AP-10) 29 July 1940. The ship was commissioned on 11 September 1940, with Capt. H. D. McHenry in command. She was reclassified as an attack transport, APA-4, on 1 February 1943. Service history On 19 February 1942, McCawley got underway for Iceland with troops embarked. She returned to New York City on 25 March and then steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, en route a new assignment with the Pacific Fleet. Transiting the Panama Canal on 18 April, she discharged Marine aviators at Pago Pago on 8 May and continued on to Wellington, New Zealand. Joining Amphibious Force, South Pacific, she became the flagship for Rear Admiral R. K. Turner shortly before the first Allied counterinvasion of the war, Guadalcanal. =Invasion of Guadalcanal= On 7 August, the campaign started; at 0800, landings were made at Tulagi, at 0919 on Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. Air raids commenced on 8 August; McCawley's guns scored their first kills, destroying three or possibly four planes. Supply missions amid naval battles On 9 August, she witnessed the flares of the Battle of Savo Island, in which American heavy cruisers , , , and Australian heavy cruiser were lost and American heavy cruiser was severely damaged. The transports continued to unload cargo until sailing for Noum√©a that afternoon. McCawley returned to Guadalcanal on 18 September with supplies and reinforcements, departing again the same day with wounded and POWs. The aircraft carrier was lost and battleship and destroyer were damaged by torpedoes while protecting this troopship convoy. On 9 October, the transport again got underway for Guadalcanal in a convoy carrying over 2,800 reinforcements. One of the support groups for the convoy was Rear Adm. Norman Scott's cruiser force, which, on the night of 11 and 12 October, defeated an enemy force off Cape Esperance, insuring successful completion of the troop movement. McCawley landed her troops and cargo, returning once more to Noum√©a with wounded and POWs. On 8 November, McCawley departed Noum√©a with other units of TF 67 for Guadalcanal. Two cruisers and three destroyers under Rear Adm. Daniel J. Callaghan supported them. At the same time, another convoy, covered by a cruiser and four destroyers under Rear Admiral Scott, set out from Espiritu Santo. Further direct support for the operations was to be supplied by battleships and destroyers of TF 64. Transports from Espiritu Santo arrived at Lunga Point on 11 November, McCawleys group from Noum√©a on 12 November. By dusk on 12 November, as reports of Japanese ship movements from Truk increased, 90% of the transports' lading had been discharged, despite torpedo bomber attacks. The transports were pulled out and sent back to Espiritu Santo, while Admiral Callaghan and Admiral Scott's combined force gallantly engaged the enemy fleet in the initial action of what was later called the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The battle, lasting from 12 to 15 November, cost the Japanese two battleships, one cruiser, three destroyers, and 11 transports. The United States lost two cruisers and seven destroyers, and Admirals Callaghan and Scott were both killed. On 24 November, McCawley departed Noum√©a for overhaul at Wellington. She returned to New Caledonia 10 January 1943 with the 1st Marine Raiders and the 3rd Parachute Battalion. After discharging those units, she loaded Army troops and construction equipment and resumed supply runs to Guadalcanal. McCawley, redesignated attack transport APA-4 on 1 February 1943, continued to supply Guadalcanal until mid-June. At that time, she began preparations for the New Georgia and central Solomons campaign. Attacked by enemy aircraft At 0643 on 30 June, she began off-loading for the landing at Rendova Island, near New Georgia. Twice, before completion at 1350, operations were halted to prepare for air attacks which did not materialize. Then, as the withdrawing column entered Blanche Channel, torpedo planes attacked. McCawley 's gunfire brought down four, but a torpedo hit in McCawleys engine room, killed 15 of her crew, and knocked out all power. Following the attack, Admiral Turner and his staff transferred to destroyer . Rear Admiral Wilkinson remained on McCawley to command salvage operations, while attack cargo ship took the transport in tow and destroyers and stood by to assist. At 1640, all the crew, except the salvage party, was taken off by Ralph Talbot. Soon afterward, the group was attacked by dive bombers, and McCawley was strafed, but no further damage was inflicted as the salvage party manned her guns to shoot down one of the three planes destroyed. By 1850, the draft aft had increased to , and Admiral Wilkinson ordered McCalla alongside to take off the salvage party. Within the hour, all hands were aboard McCalla and pulling clear of the stricken transport. Accidental sinking At 2023, the final blow came. The doomed ship was again torpedoed and in 30 seconds she sank in 340 fathoms. The following day, six motor torpedo boats were found to have torpedoed an \\"enemy\\" transport in Blanche Channel, after having been informed no friendly forces were in the area. PTs were then placed directly under Admiral Turner and given a liaison officer to keep them informed. =Awards= McCawley received five battle stars for World War II service.

Minimalism, in this sense, means designing systems that use the least hardware and software resources possible. History In the late 1970s and early 1980s, programmers worked within the confines of relatively expensive and limited resources of common platforms. Eight or sixteen kilobytes of RAM was common; 64 kilobytes was considered a vast amount and was the entire address space accessible to the 8-bit CPUs predominant during the earliest generations of personal computers. The most common storage medium was the 5.25 inch floppy disk holding from 88 to 170 kilobytes. Hard drives with capacities from five to ten megabytes cost thousands of dollars. Over time, personal-computer memory capacities expanded by orders of magnitude and mainstream programmers took advantage of the added storage to increase their software's capabilities and to make development easier by using higher-level languages. By contrast, system requirements for legacy software remained the same. As a result, even the most elaborate, feature-rich programs of yesteryear seem minimalist in comparison with current software. Many of these programs are now considered abandonware. One example of a program whose system requirements once gave it a heavyweight reputation is the GNU Emacs text editor, which gained the backronym \\"Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping\\" in an era when 8 megabytes was a lot of RAM. Today, Emacs' mainly textual buffer-based paradigm uses far fewer resources than desktop metaphor GUI IDEs with comparable features such as Eclipse or Netbeans. In a speech at the 2002 International Lisp Conference, Richard Stallman indicated that minimalism was a concern in his development of GNU and Emacs, based on his experiences with Lisp and system specifications of low-end minicomputers at the time. As the capabilities and system requirements of common desktop software and operating systems grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and as software development became dominated by teams espousing conflicting, faddish software development methodologies, some developers adopted minimalism as a philosophy and chose to limit their programs to a predetermined size or scope. A focus on software optimization can result in minimalist software, as programmers reduce the number of operations their program carries out in order to speed execution.ne has been written with sparing resource use as a basic goal. Every possible effort has been made to reduce the use of CPU time and memory, the number of system calls, and the number of characters output to the terminal. -- ne info page In the early 21st century, new developments in computing have brought minimalism to the forefront. In what has been termed the post-PC era it is no longer necessary to buy a high-end personal computer merely to perform common computing tasks. Mobile computing devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, netbooks and plug computers, often have smaller memory capacities, less-capable graphics subsystems, and slower processors when compared to the personal computer they are expected to replace. In addition, heavy use of graphics effects like alpha blending drains the battery faster than a \\"flat ui\\". The growing popularity of these devices has made minimalism an important design concern. Google's Chrome browser and Chrome OS are often cited as examples of minimalist design. In Windows 8, Microsoft decided to drop the graphics-intensive Aero user interface in favor of the \\"simple, squared-off\\" Metro appearance, which required fewer system resources. This change was made in part because of the rise of smaller, battery-powered devices and the need to conserve power.In 2009, desktops were 44% of the worldwide market and laptops were 56%. Just 3 years later, over 61% of the PCs sold are laptops and the trend is accelerating‚Äîthis is globally, measuring all Windows PCs sold. Among consumers in the United States buying a PC this year, more than 76% will purchase laptops‚Äîthe absolute number of all US desktops sold will be fewer than the number of tablets in 2012! Version 7 of Apple's iOS made similar changes for user experience reasons. Usage Developers may create user interfaces to be as simple as possible by eliminating buttons and dialog boxes that may potentially confuse the user. Minimalism is sometimes used in its visual arts meaning, particularly in the industrial design of the hardware device or software theme. Some developers have attempted to create programs to perform a particular function in the fewest lines of code, or smallest compiled executable size possible on a given platform. Some Linux distributions mention minimalism as a goal. Alpine Linux, Arch Linux, Puppy Linux, Bodhi Linux, CrunchBang Linux, dynebolic and Tiny Core Linux are examples. The early development of the Unix system occurred on low-powered hardware, and Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson have stated their opinion that this constraint contributed to the system's \\"elegance of design\\". Programming language designers can create minimal programming languages by eschewing syntactic sugar and extensive library functions. Such languages may be Turing tarpits due to not offering standard support for common programming tasks. Creating a minimal Lisp interpreter is a common learning task set before computer science students. The Lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church is a minimal programming language that uses only function definitions and function applications. Scheme, Forth, and Go are cited as examples of practical, minimal programming languages. The programming hobby of code golf results in minimalist software, but these are typically exercises or code poetry, not usable applications software. John Millar Carroll, in his book Minimalism Beyond the N√ºrnberg Funnel pointed out that the use of minimalism results in \\"instant-use\\" devices such as video games, ATMs, voting machines, and mall kiosks with little-or-no learning curve that do not require the user to read manuals. User Interface researchers have performed experiments suggesting that minimalism, as illustrated by the design principles of parsimony and transparency, bolsters efficiency and learnability. Minimalism is implicit in the Unix philosophies of \\"everything is a text stream\\" and \\"do one thing and do it well\\", although modern Unix/Linux distributions do not hold so rigorously to this philosophy.

It is the capital of the Gia Lai Province. Many years ago, it was inhabited primarily by the Bahnar and Jarai ethnic groups, sometimes known as the Montagnards or Degar, although now it is inhabited primarily by the Kinh ethnic group. The city is the centre of the urban district of Pleiku which covers an area of 261 km¬≤. As of 2003 the district had a population of 186,763. The city sits at the junction of several national roads‚ÄîNational Route 14 to Kon Tum in the north and Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt in the south and National Route 19 to St≈ìng Tr√™ng in Cambodia in the west (via Ratanakiri Province) and to B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province in the east. The city is home to the Ho√†ng Anh Gia Lai football club. Pleiku is served by Pleiku Airport in the near outskirts of the city. History = First Indochina War = At the end of the First Indochina War, in June 1954, the French Army Groupe Mobile 100 was ordered to fall back from An Kh√™ to Pleiku and then to reopen Route Coloniale 14 between Pleiku and Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt. This led to the last battle of the war: the Battle of Mang Yang Pass. = Second Indochina War = T' Nung Lake in outskirt of Pleiku Pleiku Square in Pleiku Minh Thanh Pagoda in Pleiku Pleiku was strategically important during the Vietnam War because it was the primary terminus of the military supply logistics corridor extending westwards along Highway 19 from the coastal population centre and port facilities of Qui Nh∆°n. Additionally, its central location on the plateau, between Kon Tum to the north, Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt to the south, and the North Vietnamese Army's base areas inside Cambodia to the west made Pleiku the main centre of defense of the entire highland region of the Republic of Vietnam. This was obvious to both sides; the United States established an armed presence very early in the conflict at Camp Holloway, and the Vi·ªát C·ªông attack on this base in early 1965 was one of the key escalating events that brought U.S. troops into the conflict.Karnow, Stanley. Vietnam: A History, New York: Penguin Books, (1984), p. 428, On 15 June 1972, Cathay Pacific Flight 700Z, operating a Convair 880 (VR-HFZ) from Bangkok to Hong Kong, disintegrated and crashed while the aircraft was flying at 29,000 feet (8,800 m) over Pleiku, Vietnam after a bomb exploded in a suitcase placed under a seat in the cabin, killing all 81 people on board. After the fall of Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt to a major North Vietnamese assault in early 1975, and the resulting insecurity of National Route 19 leading from Qui Nh∆°n, the president, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, ordered the hasty evacuation of Pleiku. The military operation to attempt the withdrawal of ARVN forces, down the poorly maintained tertiary road LTL-7B through Ayun Pa to Tuy H√≤a, led to a catastrophe in which over 100,000 evacuees from Pleiku and Kon Tum were killed or left stranded without support.

Although the acronym refers specifically to radio transmission, the technology is also employed via wire, cable, or optical fiber. As a \\"paperless encryption key system\\" OTAR was originally adopted specifically in support of high speed data communications because previously known \\"paperless key\\" systems such as supported by Diffie-Hellman key exchange, See Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange or Firefly key exchange technology See Firefly (key exchange protocol) (as used in the now obsolete STU-III \\"scrambled\\" telephone)See STU- III were not capable of handling the high speed transmission volumes required by normal governmental/military communications traffic.[Creation of OTAR] \\"echoed some of the objectives of my own development of public key cryptography...\\" Letter from Whitfield Diffie, Turing Award Winner, to Vice Admiral Sean Buck, Superintendent, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD, August 6th, 2020 Now also adopted for civilian and commercial secure voice use, especially by emergency first responders, OTAR has become not only a security technology, but a preferred basis of communications security doctrine world-wide. The term \\"OTAR\\" is now basic to the lexicon of communications security. History OTAR was operationally introduced to the US Department of Defense via the Navy beginning in 1988. Lieutenant Commander David Winters, an American naval officer in London and code master during the final years of the Cold War,Also see STU-III and John Anthony Walker was first to recognize the necessity and security potential of OTAR. In order to exploit the advantages of this technology, he conceived and initiated its first large scale practical application and deployment.Navy Award Citations for Lieutenant Commander David D. Winters, dtd. 15 May 1992, 3 August 1992, and 26 August 1994, Due to the efficiency and vast cost savings inherent to OTAR, Commander Winters' methods were quickly adopted and spread Navy-wide, following which Vice Admiral J.O Tuttle, Commander of the Navy Telecommunications Command,See Jerry O. Tuttle the Navy \\"J6\\", shortly influenced the Joint Chiefs of Staff to bring all the other military services into compliance.(U) American Cryptology During the Cold War (1945-1989), (U) Book IV, Cryptologic Rebirth, 1981-1999, by Thomas R. Johnson, Center For Cryptologic History, National Security Agency, pp 40-41. In due course, OTAR shortly became the NATO standard. This coincided with the introduction of newer NSA cryptographic systems that use a 128-bit electronic key, such as the ANDVT, KY-58, KG-84A/C, and KY-75, capable of obtaining new or updated keys via the circuit they protect or other secure communications circuits. Adoption of OTAR reduces requirements both for the distribution of physical keying material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes. Accordingly, OTAR eliminates the need for individual stations to be involved with physical key changeovers. Instead, electronically transmitted keys would normally come from a network control station (NCS). The OTAT feature permits a key to be extracted from an OTAT- capable cryptographic system using a fill device, such as the KYK-13 or KYX-15/KYX-15A and then loaded (\\"squirted\\") into another cryptographic system as needed. Alternatively, encryption systems may also be configured to automatically receive and update code keys with virtually no manual intervention, as is the case for GPS (Geo-Positioning System) navigation satellite signals. Present and future Now that OTAR applications have been adapted for civilian emergency service providers and other users requiring enhanced communications security, extensive parallel technology conversion and development have produced commercially viable systems that include end-to-end key generation, distribution, management, and control.https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec11/tech/full_papers/Clark.pdf Why (Special Agent) Johnny (Still) Can‚Äôt Encrypt: A Security Analysis of the APCO Project 25 Two-Way Radio System by Sandy Clark, Travis Goodspeed, Perry Metzger, Zachary Wasserman, Kevin Xu, and Matt Blaze for the University of Pennsylvaniahttps://www.hsdl.org/?view&did;=455597 Saving Lives and Property Through Improved Interoperability: Introduction to Encryption Key Management for Public Safety Radio Systems, October 2001, Public Safety Wireless Network Programhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/224791.pdf JAN. 09 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice, TOWARD CRIMINAL JUSTICE SOLUTIONS, Over-the-Air (OTA) Communications, Improvements for Police Departments, JAN 09http://www.vsp.state.va.us/downloads/STARSContract/Appendix%2005%20-%2032%20-%20Encryption%20Info%202%20KMF.pdf Specification Sheet, KMF, Key Management Facilityhttp://www.relmservice.com/manuals/bk/otar_setup.pdf OTAR CHECK LISThttps://www.manualslib.com/manual/617020/E-F-Johnson- Company-5300-Series.html?page=64 E.F.

This simplifies and streamlines operations while virtually eliminating risk of compromise. In practical terms, this means users need not bring or return their units for manual updates, nor must technicians visit each user, station, or node to service their units in the field. Further, in the unlikely event that a unit, station, or node is stolen, mimicked, or otherwise compromised, a network controller may: * Remotely inhibit access of additional users, stations, or nodes to the network. * Remotely and securely enable network access to additional users, stations, or nodes. * Remotely \\"zeroize\\" or remove a user's, station's, or node's cryptographic key material. * Remotely and securely change or update a user‚Äôs, station's, or node's cryptographic keys. Significance Because introduction of this technology obviated previous requirements for risky, expensive, wide-spread, distribution of paper code keys, it thereby extinguished vulnerability to physical theft and loss as exploited by the infamous \\"Johnny Walker\\" spy ring.See John Anthony Walker. Elimination of this vulnerability, although little appreciated at the time, was an innovation of inestimable impact. Placing this technology in perspective, OTAR comprised a transformation at the most basic foundations of communications security such that through the decades since introduction of OTAR, not a single new breach of US code systems has occurred. Introduction of OTAR technology into practical application precipitated NSA creation of the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) which permanently altered the power balance in communications security and espionage. Recent declassification of the details relating to its introduction may be expected to now become the subject of more scholarly work.OVER THE AIR REKEYING, A ROGUE SECURITY REVOLUTION, oral presentation by David Winters, Symposium for Cryptologic History, Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, 19 October 2017, (referenced with permission of author).

He saw a disciplined system of archaeological techniques as a means to extend the principles of anthropology into the prehistoric past and so was the originator of the first comprehensive, systematic approach to North American archaeology. Early life Born in Marquette, Michigan, Kidder was the son of a mining engineer. He entered Harvard College with the intention of qualifying for medical school, but found himself uninspired by premedical courses. He applied for a summer job in archaeology with the University of Utah in 1907. Kidder spent two successive summers in the mesa and canyon country of southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah and areas of New Mexico. Kidder and Jesse L. Nusbaum (later Superintendent of Mesa Verde National Park), came to the Mesa Verde area with ethnologist Jesse Walter Fewkes to conduct an archaeological survey and to photograph ruins. He obtained his bachelor's degree at Harvard in 1908 and a doctorate in anthropology in 1914. Archaeological career Kidder then embarked on a series of expeditions to the Southwest, many in northeastern Arizona. These expeditions were sponsored by Harvard‚Äôs Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the associated Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. From 1915 to 1929, Kidder conducted site excavations at an abandoned pueblo near Pecos, New Mexico, now the Pecos National Historical Park. He excavated levels of human occupation at the pueblo going back more than 2000 years, and gathered a detailed record of cultural artifacts, including a large collection of pottery fragments and human remains. From these items, he was able to establish a continuous record of pottery styles from 2000 years ago to the mid-to-late 19th century. Kidder then analyzed trends and changes in pottery styles in association with changes in the Pecos people‚Äôs culture and established a basic chronology for the Southwest. With Samuel J. Guernsey, he established the validity of a chronological approach to cultural periods. Kidder asserted that deductions about the development of human culture could be obtained through a systematic examination of stratigraphy and chronology in archaeological sites. This research laid the foundation for modern archaeological field methods, shifting the emphasis from a \\"gentlemanly adventure\\" adding items such as whole pots and cliff dwellings to museum coffers to the study of potsherds and other artifacts in relation to the cultural history. Pioneering archaeologists in other regions of the United States completed the transformation of professional methodology initiated by Kidder. His Introduction to the Study of Southwestern Archaeology, published in 1924, was the first synthesis of North American prehistory based on professionally recovered empirical data. In spite of his efforts at documentation, Kidder‚Äôs conclusions have sometimes been criticized for a lack of integration between his field reports and his later synthesis and interpretation of that data. However, Kidder clearly emphasized archaeology's need for a scientific \\"eye\\" in the development of fact collecting techniques and clear definitions. In the late 1920s, Kidder started the Pecos Conferences for archaeologists and ethnologists working in the American southwest. In 1927, a temporal system of nomenclature, known as the Pecos Classification System, was established for use in southwestern sites. Archaeologists have since used the sequence, with later variations, to assign approximate dates to dozens of sites throughout the Southwest and to determine cultural ties and differences among them. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1936, Kidder formally used the Navajo term \\"Anasazi\\" to define a specific cultural group of people living in the southwest between approximately 200 BC and 1300 AD. This term had been casually used by excavators for many of the \\"ancient people\\" since the early explorations of Richard Wetherill, and had been informally used in the work of the Pecos Conferences. As an associate in charge of archaeological investigations (1927‚Äì1929) and as chairman of the division of historical research (1929‚Äì1950) at the Carnegie Institution, Kidder conducted a broad- scale multidisciplinary research program in Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands which established the framework of Maya stratigraphy. In 1939 he became honorary curator of Southwestern American archaeology at the Peabody Museum, Harvard. In 1951, Kidder, in discussions with Thomas Stuart Ferguson and Gordon Willey of Harvard University, was instrumental in establishing a foundation dealing with the status of archaeology in Mexico and Central America. In regard to those discussions, Ferguson wrote that the three scholars agreed ‚Äú...it was unfortunate that so little work was being carried on in so important an area and that something should be done to increase explorations and excavations....Despite the amazing discoveries made between 1930 and 1950, work on the Pre-Classic was virtually at a standstill in 1951. The result of the discussion was that we agreed to set up a new organization to be devoted to the Pre-Classic civilizations of Mexico and Central America‚Äîthe earliest known high cultures of the New World.‚Äù The following year, the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF) was incorporated in California, as a nonprofit, scientific, fact-finding body. Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation During Kidder‚Äôs studies and excavations at Pecos Pueblo, particularly between 1915 and 1929, pottery and other artifacts were sent to the Robert S. Peabody Museum, Andover, Massachusetts, while excavated human remains were sent to the Peabody Museum at Harvard. In the early 20th century, no archaeologist consulted with Native American descendants concerning the excavation of their ancestors' homes and graves. Although Kidder was aware of the long-standing relationship between the abandoned Pecos Pueblo and the modern Pueblo of Jemez, he did not consider that any local population had a claim on artifacts and remains. By a 1936 Act of Congress, the Pueblo of Jemez became the legal and administrative representative of the Pueblo of Pecos, which had been privately owned during Kidder‚Äôs excavation. As a consequence of The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which requires federal and other museum facilities to inventory, establish cultural affiliations, and publish in the Federal Register any and all Native American human remains and certain objects in their possession, the Pueblo of Jemez made a formal claim on behalf of the Pecos people. This repatriation was primarily due to the efforts of William J. Whatley, the Jemez Pueblo tribal archaeologist, who searched through museum records for these remains and artifacts for eight years. The human remains from Kidder‚Äôs excavations were returned to the Jemez people in 1999 and ritually reburied at Pecos National Historic Park. In a sense, they rejoined Kidder, as he is buried on a hillside not far away, close to Pecos Pueblo. Family life Although her name rarely occurred on publications, Kidder's wife Madeleine worked as an archaeologist alongside her husband. Kidder's grandson, T.R. Kidder is a noted archaeologist of the southeastern United States.

Its studios are located in Downtown Albuquerque and the transmitter tower is located atop Sandia Crest east of the city. Its brand is \\"93-3 The Q - Albuquerque's #1 Hit Music Station.\\" The station plays Top 40 music. History In 1964 Hubbard Broadcasting Inc. applied to the Federal Communications Commission to build a new FM radio station to operate alongside KOB AM (770) and KOB-TV channel 4. The station was originally planned to broadcast by Fall of that year with an antenna erected on the AM tower and duplicate the AM programming.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156671401/ The station would sign on August 14, 1967 as KOB-FM and would feature a completely automated format operating from 6:30 am to midnight of \\"modern, stereophonic music performed by the top recording artists of the day\\". Selections included \\"bright uptempo sounds\\" in the morning to jazz and light classical in the evenings. KOB-FM would also be the first station to broadcast from atop Sandia Crest. The broadcast range at the time was determined to be about 150 miles. Management stated: \\"The decision to program from the transmitter atop the mountain stems from the fact that stereophonic programming material relayed to a transmitter via microwave results in a reproduction of lower sound quality\\".https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156844739/ KOB-FM would continue to air \\"background music\\" through the end of the 1970s.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/157951039/ August 1981 saw a shift in programming as KOB-FM would change to an adult contemporary format.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/157951039/ KOB-FM would become one of the highest rated stations throughout the 1980s and would see more competition by 1985.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41242546/two-more- stations-seek-slice-of-kob/ However KOB-FM continued to dominate the market for many years.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/158352262/ In October 1986 Hubbard sold KOB AM and FM to Price Communications for $16.5 million. The call letters were changed to KKOB-FM with no changes in programming.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/157631011/ The stations would later be acquired by Fairmont Communications. Fairmont would sell both stations to Citadel Communications in late 1993 for $9 million.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Duncan-American- Radio/Duncan-1993-Fall.pdf page 9 Citadel would also acquired KMGA 99.5 which had a soft AC format forming a FM duopoly. KKOB-FM by this time would be airing a hot adult contemporary format. The then-KKOB-FM's first shift to mainstream top 40 came in 1999, playing \\"Today's Best Music\\", rivaling the newly launched KCHQ-FM, \\"Channel 105.1\\", which returned the top 40 format to the market after a six-year absence. Both stations were often head-to-head in the ratings until November 2000, when KCHQ had shifted to a 1980s‚Äô hits format. However, in January 2001, KKOB-FM would also switch to a 1980s format, putting the two stations in competition once again. KKSS, which had been facing a fierce rhythmic battle with KYLZ-FM, would become the area's mainstream top 40 outlet a few weeks later, but in November 2002, KKSS was sold to Hispanic Broadcasting and had returned to rhythmic top 40. KCHQ had dropped the 1980s format in the Fall of 2001, but the format continued to lose steam on KKOB-FM. Therefore, on Christmas Day, 2002, KKOB-FM would return to the top 40 format and had also returned to using the three-letter 'KOB' ID in its branding. On November 15, 2019, KKOB-FM rebranded as \\"93.3 The Q\\" (with the new call-sign KOBQ) with no change in format. The change was made in part to avoid confusion with sister station KKOB, as it had made more emphasis on its recently added FM translator at 94.5 MHz.KKOB-FM Rebrands as 93.3 The Q The KKOB-FM call letters were reassigned to 96.3 FM (formerly KBZU) on January 6, 2020, when that station began simulcasting the news/talk format of 770 KKOB.

It is a World Heritage Site included in Hill Forts of Rajasthan. Built during the course of the 15th century by Rana Kumbha. Occupied until the late 19th century, the fort is now open to the public and is spectacularly lit for a few minutes each evening. Kumbalgarh is situated 82 km northwest of Udaipur by road. It was the most important fort in Mewar after Chittorgarh Fort. In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Kumbhalgarh Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the group Hill Forts of Rajasthan. The fort is among the largest fort complexes in the world, and the second largest fort in India after Chittor Fort.  History  The early history of the fort could not be ascertained on account of lack of evidence. The earliest name of the fort is believed to be Machhindrapur, while Sahib Haqim, a historian, named it Mahore. The original fort is believed to have been built by King Samprati of the Maura Age on account of strategic importance during the 6th century. The subsequent history till 1303 AD till the invasion of Alauddin Khilji is obscure as the fort was insignificant at that time.Asawa 2004, pp. 2‚Äì3 Kumbhalgarh in its current form was built by Rana Kumbha who was the Rana of Mewar from the Sisodia rajput clan. Rana Kumbha took the aid of the famous architect of the era, \\"Madan\\". Rana Kumbha's kingdom of Mewar stretched from Ranthambore to Gwalior and included large tracts of what is now Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Out of the 84 forts in his dominion, Rana Kumbha is said to have built 32 of them, of which Kumbhalgarh is the largest and most elaborate. Kumbhalgarh also separated Mewar and Marwar from each other and was used as a place of refuge for the rulers of Mewar at times of danger. A notable instance was in the case of Prince Udai, the infant king of Mewar who was smuggled here in 1535, when Chittaur was under siege. Prince Udai later succeeded to the throne. The fort remained impregnable to direct assault. Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat attacked the fort in 1457, but found the effort futile. There was a local belief then that the Banmata deity in the fort protected it and hence he destroyed the temple. There were further attempts in 1458‚Äì59 and 1467 by Mahmud Khalji, but it also proved futile. Akbar's general, Shabhbaz Khan, is believed to have taken control of the fort in 1576. But it was recaptured by Maharana Pratap in 1585. In 1818, an armed band of Sanyasins formed a garrison to protect the fort, but was convinced by Tod and the fort was taken over by the British and later returned to Udaipur State. There were additions made by Maharanas of Mewar, but the original structure built by Maharana Kumbha remains. The residential buildings and temples are well-preserved. The fort is also known to be the birthplace of Maha Rana Pratap. Architecture The massive gate of Kumbhalgarh fort, called the Ram Pol (Ram Gate) Built on a hilltop above sea level on the Aravalli range, the fort of Kumbhalgarh has perimeter walls that extend , making it one of the longest walls in the world. The frontal walls are fifteen feet thick. Kumbhalgarh has seven fortified gateways. There are over 360 temples within the fort, 300 ancient Jain and the rest Hindu. From the palace top, it is possible to see kilometers into the Aravalli Range. The sand dunes of the Thar Desert can be seen from the fort walls. According to popular folklore, Maharana Kumbha used to burn massive lamps that consumed fifty kilograms of ghee and a hundred kilograms of cotton to provide light for the farmers who worked during the nights in the valley. Important structures in the fort Lakhola Tank is the most notable tank inside the fort, constructed by Rana Lakha during 1382‚Äì1421 CE. It is located in the Western side of Kelwara town and measures in length to to in width. The tank had a depth of during independence and since then has been raised to . Aaret Pol is the gate on the western side, Halla Pol with an downward slope from the entrance, Ram Pol and Hanuman Pol near Bavadi are the major gates of the fort. There are inscriptions on the foot of idols in Hanuman Pol detailing the construction of the fort. Bad Shahi Bavdi is a stepped tank, believed to have been built during the invasion of Shahbaz Khan in 1578, the general of Akbar to provide water to the troops.Asawa 2004, pp. 13‚Äì15 Most buildings are visible from the Ram Pol, which is considered an architectural specimen. ;Hindu Temple A Ganesh temple built on a platform and is considered the earliest of all temples built inside the fort.Asawa 2004, p. 15 Neel Kanth Mahadeva temple is located on the eastern side of the fort built during 1458 CE. The central shrine of Shiva is approached through a rectangular enclosure and through a structure supported by 24 huge pillars. The idol of Shiva is made of black stone and is depicted with 12 hands. The inscriptions indicate that the temple was renovated by Rana Shanga.Asawa 2004, p. 16 ;Jain Temple Parsva Natha temple (built during 1513), Jain temple on the eastern side and Bawan (52) Jain temples and Golera Jain temple are the major Jain temples in the fort. Mataji temple, also called Kheda Devi temple is located on the southern side of Neela Kanth temple.Asawa 2004, pp. 18‚Äì19 Mamdeo temple, Pital Shah Jain temple and Surya Mandir (Sun temple) are the other major temples inside the fort.Asawa 2004, pp. 22‚Äì23 Culture The Rajasthan Tourism Department organizes a three-day annual festival in the fort in remembrance of the passion of Maharana Kumbha towards art and architecture. Sound and light shows are organized with the fort as the background. Various concerts and dance events are also organised to commemorate the function. The other events during the festival are Heritage Fort Walk, turban tying, tug-of war and mehendi mandana among others. Six forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, Chittor Fort, Gagron Fort, Jaisalmer Fort, Kumbhalgarh and Ranthambore Fort were included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list during the 37th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013. They were recognized as a serial cultural property and examples of Rajput military hill architecture.

It is part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. Geography It takes name after the impressive historic fort of Kumbhalgarh. The wildlife sanctuary consists of a core area and a buffer area. It covers four hill and mountain ranges of the Aravalli: Kumbhalgarh range; Sadri range; Desuri range and the Bokhada range. Twenty-two villages are located inside the sanctuary. The soils are generally thin, mostly of sandy loam. The base rocks are mainly metamorphic, from the Archean. The topography of the sanctuary can be divided into hills, piedmont and plain. The areas of plain have mostly been co-opted for crops. Kumbhalgarh's natural environment attracts tourists, and is accessible from Udaipur and Nathdwara which are 100 km and 51km respectively from the sanctuary. Foot tracking and horse safari organised by local tour operators are available. A typical safari route enters the sanctuary from the Kumbhalgarh Fort and cuts across the sanctuary to Ghanerao, and then follows an old abandoned road. Fauna The sanctuary is home to a variety of wildlife, some of which are endangered species. The wildlife includes the Indian wolf, Indian leopard, sloth bear, striped hyena, Golden jackal, jungle cat, sambhar, nilgai, chausingha (the four horned antelope), chinkara and Indian hare. The leopard is the apex predator in the sanctuary. The birds at Kumbhalgarh includes the normally shy and untrusting grey junglefowl. Peacocks and doves can be sighted feeding on grains scattered by the jungle guards. Birds like the red spurfowl, parakeet, golden oriole, grey pigeon, bulbul, dove and white breasted kingfisher can also be seen near the water holes. =Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project= Kumbalgarh Sanctuary was one of the places that were considered for the reintroduction of the Asiatic lion.

It is situated along a 150m stretch of the Stung Kbal Spean River, from the main Angkor group of monuments, which lie downstream. The site consists of a series of stone rock relief carvings in sandstone formations of the river bed and banks. It is commonly known as the \\"Valley of a 1000 Lingas\\" or \\"The River of a Thousand Lingas\\". The motifs for stone carvings are mainly myriads of lingams (phallic symbol of Hindu god Shiva), depicted as neatly arranged bumps that cover the surface of a sandstone bed rock, and lingam-yoni designs. There are also various Hindu mythological motifs, including depictions of the gods Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Lakshmi, Rama, and Hanuman, as well as animals (cows and frogs). Geography Kbal Spean is described as \\"a spectacularly carved riverbed, set deep in the jungle to the northeast of Angkor\\". The river over which the bridge head exists is also known as Stung Kbal Spean, a tributary of the Siem Reap River that rises in the Kulein mountains north of Banteay Srei. The river bed cuts through sandstone formations, and the many architectural sculptures of Hindu mythology have been carved within the sandstone. The archaeological site occurs in a stretch of the river starting from upstream north of the bridge head to the falls downstream. The river, being sanctified by flowing over the religious sculptures, flows downstream, bifurcating into the Siem Reap River and Puok River, which eventually flows into the Tonl√© Sap Lake after passing through the plains and the Angkor temple complex. The archaeological site is in the western part of the Kulein mountains within the Phnom Kulen National Park. Approach is from the Banteay Srei temple by a road which is about from an army camp. Thereafter, it is a 40-minute walk through the forest for about uphill along a path before reaching the first site, a water fall, where the carved sculptures start appearing in the river bed. History The carving of vestiges began with the reign of King Suryavarman I and ended with the reign of King Udayadityavarman II; these two kings ruled between the 11th and 12th centuries. The 1,000 lingas, but not other sculptures, are attributed to a minister of Suryavarman I during the 11th century, and these were carved by hermits who lived in the area. Inscriptions at the site testify to the fact that most of the sculpting was done during the reign of Udayadityavarman II. It is also mentioned that King Udayadityavarman II consecrated a golden ling here in 1059 AD. It is believed that the Siem Reap River flowing into Angkor is blessed by the sacred lingas over which it flows. The archaeological site was discovered in 1969 by Jean Boulbet, an ethnologist, but further exploration was cut off due to the Cambodian Civil War. The site regained prominence for safe visits from 1989. Layout The bridge is a natural sandstone arch northeast of Siem Reap River. Just after the monsoon season, when the water level in the river starts dropping, the carvings are visible in a stretch upstream of the bridge and from the bridge downstream up to the falls. The 11th century carvings in this stretch of the river are a galaxy of gods, the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva or Maheswara and celestial beings; several carvings of Vishnu with Lakshmi reclining on the serpent Ananta, Shiva with consort Uma, known as Umamaheswar Brahma on a lotus petal over a plant stem rising from the navel of Vishnu, Rama and Hanuman are the sculptures seen not only in the river bed but also on the river banks. Sequentially, while walking along a path which skirts the eroded channel of the river-formed natural stone bridge, one can see a pair of Vishnu sculptures with Lakshmi seated at his feet in a reclining pose. Upstream of the bridge, there is a sculpture of Shiva and Uma mounted on the bull. Approximately downstream of the bridge, there are additional Vishnu sculptures. Further downstream up to the water fall and till the water pool are the Sahasra lingas in Sanskrit language with English equivalent name of \\"Thousand Lingas\\". The sculpted lingams in the coarse sandstone river bed outcrops are seen from about downstream of the bridge. According to the journalist Teppo Tukki of Phnom Penh Post who visited the site in 1995, the lingams, some of which date back to the 9th century, are about square and deep and lined in a perfect grid pattern. The river runs over them, covering them with of pristine water. The holy objects are designed to create a \\"power path for the Khmer Kings\\". After the carvings, the river falls by to a clear water pool. As it flows over the holy lingams, the river attains a sanctified status and passes through the temples that are downstream. The visible lingams are in a rectangular enclosure with a channel flowing out, which is interpreted to represent the yoni as the \\"female principle\\". Beyond these lingams, the river stretch of about includes a small rocky island and ends over a fall into a pool. In this stretch of the river, there are bas reliefs on the rock faces. It has been inferred that one of the bas reliefs in this stretch, the central figure, unrecognizably damaged, could be that of Shiva as an ascetic, similar to the bas relief seen in Angkor Wat temple. The meaning of the crocodile carving seen here has not been ascertained. Near to this location, a boulder has been carved as a frog. The pond, in a rectangular shape, filled with water at all times, has many \\"Reclining Vishnu\\" carvings on the walls, and here again, a pair of crocodiles are carved but with their tail held by women. The small island formed in this stretch of the river has carvings of Shiva and Uma mounted on a bull. Sculptures Lord Vishnu in a reclining repose lying on the serpent god Ananta, with Goddess Lakshmi at his feet and Lord Brahma on a lotus petal, in Kbal Spean River bank The sculptures carved in the river bed and banks depict many Hindu mythological scenes and symbols. There are also inscriptions which get exposed as the water level in the river decreases. The common theme of these sculptures emphasizes creation as defined in Hindu mythology in the form of Lord Vishnu lying on a serpent in a reclining repose on the ocean of milk in mediation, the lotus flower emerging from Vishnu‚Äôs navel which bears god Brahma, the creator. Following these sculptures seen carved on the banks of the river, the river flows through several sculpted reliefs of Shiva the destroyer shown in the universal symbol of the Linga; 1000 such lingas have been carved in the bed of the river which gives the name to the river valley formed by the river as \\"valley of 1000 lingas\\". Vishnu is also carved to match the contours of the river bed and banks. A carving of Shiva with his consort Uma is also visible. Though the sculptures have been vandalized and damaged, the carved idols still retain their original grandeur. Under the supervision of archaeologists, the graduates of Artisans d'Angkor have been able to reproduce some portions of Kbal Spean's missing bas-relief carvings. Biodiversity Also situated within the Phnom Kulen National Park, and close to the river outfall, is the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity where \\"trafficked animals are nursed back to health\\".

A graduate of Cambridge University, he is best known for his compositions of Anglican church music; his Preces and Responses, for use in the Anglican service of evensong, is widely performed. He served as a soldier in the Second World War, and went on to become a noted choir master and music tutor, counting among his pupils the composer Kenneth Leighton, musicians Professor Roger Bray, Professor David Wulstan and Harry Christophers, and actor Dudley Moore. Education Salisbury Cathedral Organ, where Rose began his musical studies Bernard Rose sang as a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral from 1925 to 1931. There, he also studied the organ under Sir Walter Galpin Alcock, and was appointed as an assistant organist at the cathedral aged just 15. From 1933 to 1935, Rose studied at the Royal College of Music where he continued his organ studies under Sir Walter. In 1935, he won the organ scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, beating Edward Heath to the position. At Cambridge, Rose studied under Hubert Middleton and Edward Joseph Dent from 1935 to 1939. Career The Queen's College, Oxford Rose started his academic career at The Queen's College, Oxford. As Rose began his position as a tutor in music, organist of The Queen's College, Oxford, and conductor of the Eglesfield Music Society, the Second World War was declared. With the war having just begun, Rose married his financ√©e, Molly Marshall, at Christmas 1939. =Military service= Rose volunteered and was seen by an army selection board and called up in September 1940, when he underwent training. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry on 26 January 1941. He saw action in the North African and Italian campaigns as a \\"Desert Rat\\" with the 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), and took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944. A week later, Molly was informed that Bernard has been killed in action; in fact he had been captured on 13 June 1944 during the Battle of Villers-Bocage in Normandy, as she later learned. Bernard spent the remainder of the war at Oflag 79, a German POW camp near Brunswick, Lower Saxony, until the Ninth United States Army released him and his colleagues on 12 April 1945. He left the army with the rank of captain. Molly Rose also saw service during the war, piloting Spitfires, Wellington bombers, Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighter- bombers in the Air Transport Auxiliary. =Postwar career= Magdalen College Chapel, where Rose was a choirmaster After the war, Rose resumed his academic teaching role at The Queen's College in 1945, and remained there until he was appointed Informator Choristarum (organist and master of the choristers) at Magdalen College (1957‚Äì1981). Rose became a sought-after tutor, particularly for harmony and counterpoint and a distinguished choir master. His pupils included Kenneth Leighton, Dudley Moore, Harry Christophers of The Sixteen and his son, Gregory Rose. His special study of the choral music of Thomas Tomkins was published in Musica Deo Sacra; another major work was his editing of Handel's oratorio Susanna (Kassel 1967). Former choristers inspired by his leadership include Daniel Sandford, John La Bouchardi√®re and Jonathan Powell. In 1952, Rose conducted the premiere of An Oxford Elegy by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Rose introduced Kenneth Leighton to the composer Gerald Finzi in the late 1940s, and the two developed a close friendship and artistic association. After Finzi's death, Leighton dedicated his Veris Gratia Suite, Op. 9 to his friend, and the choral version was conducted in Oxford by Bernard Rose in 1956. For ten years from 1957 he was president of the City of Oxford Silver Band, which he also conducted. Rose served as Vice President of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1973‚Äì1975 and Emeritus Fellow 1981‚Äì1996. He was in his later years president of the Royal College of Organists 1974‚Äì1976. Honours He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1980 New Year Honours, \\"For Services to Music\\". His wife Molly, who survived him, has featured in a number of seminars and T.V. programmes concerning the role of women pilots delivering aircraft to the front line. Legacy Bernard Rose's dedication to high quality choral singing at Magdalen Chapel was highly influential. He is said to have inspired some of Britain's leading choirs, including the Clerkes of Oxenford, The Sixteen, The Tallis Scholars and Ex Cathedra. In 2010, Bernard Rose's son Graham discovered old tape recordings of performances of Magdalen College Choir conducted by his father, dating from 1960 to 1976. The recordings were remastered and released on audio CD in 2015 by Oxrecs to commemorate the centenary of Rose's birth.

As its IUPAC name indicates, tetrafluoromethane is the perfluorinated counterpart to the hydrocarbon methane. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Tetrafluoromethane is a useful refrigerant but also a potent greenhouse gas. It has a very high bond strength due to the nature of the carbon‚Äìfluorine bond. Bonding Because of the multiple carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds are the strongest single bonds in organic chemistry. Additionally, they strengthen as more carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds are added to the same carbon. In the one carbon organofluorine compounds represented by molecules of fluoromethane, difluoromethane, trifluoromethane, and tetrafluoromethane, the carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds are strongest in tetrafluoromethane. This effect is due to the increased coulombic attractions between the fluorine atoms and the carbon because the carbon has a positive partial charge of 0.76.  Preparation  Tetrafluoromethane is the product when any carbon compound, including carbon itself, is burned in an atmosphere of fluorine. With hydrocarbons, hydrogen fluoride is a coproduct. It was first reported in 1926. It can also be prepared by the fluorination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or phosgene with sulfur tetrafluoride. Commercially it is manufactured by the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with dichlorodifluoromethane or chlorotrifluoromethane; it is also produced during the electrolysis of metal fluorides MF, MF2 using a carbon electrode. Although it can be made from myriad precursors and fluorine, elemental fluorine is expensive and difficult to handle. Consequently, is prepared on an industrial scale using hydrogen fluoride: :CCl2F2 \\\\+ 2 HF ‚Üí CF4 \\\\+ 2 HCl =Laboratory synthesis= Tetrafluoromethane can be prepared in the laboratory by the reaction of silicon carbide with fluorine. : SiC + 4 F2 ‚Üí CF4 \\\\+ SiF4 Reactions Tetrafluoromethane, like other fluorocarbons, is very stable due to the strength of its carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds. The bonds in tetrafluoromethane have a bonding energy of 515 kJ‚ãÖmol‚àí1. As a result, it is inert to acids and hydroxides. However, it reacts explosively with alkali metals. Thermal decomposition or combustion of CF4 produces toxic gases (carbonyl fluoride and carbon monoxide) and in the presence of water will also yield hydrogen fluoride. It is very slightly soluble in water (about 20 mg‚ãÖL‚àí1), but miscible with organic solvents. Uses Tetrafluoromethane is sometimes used as a low temperature refrigerant (R-14). It is used in electronics microfabrication alone or in combination with oxygen as a plasma etchant for silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride.K. Williams, K. Gupta, M. Wasilik. Etch Rates for Micromachining Processing ‚Äì Part II J. Microelectromech. Syst., vol. 12, pp. 761‚Äì777, December 2003. It also has uses in neutron detectors.  Environmental effects  Mauna Loa tetrafluoromethane (CF4) timeseries. Atmospheric concentration of CF4 (PFC-14) vs. similar man- made gases (right graph). Note the log scale. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. It is very stable, has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years, and a high greenhouse warming potential of 6500 (which is given for the first 100 years thereof, CO2 has a factor of 1). Tetrafluoromethane is the most abundant perfluorocarbon in the atmosphere, where it is designated as PFC-14. Its atmospheric concentration is growing. As of 2019, the man-made gases CFC-11 and CFC-12 continue to contribute a stronger radiative forcing than PFC-14. Although structurally similar to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), tetrafluoromethane does not deplete the ozone layer. This is because the depletion is caused by the chlorine atoms in CFCs, which dissociate when struck by UV radiation. Carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds are stronger and less likely to dissociate. According to Guinness World Records Tetrafluoromethane is the most persistent greenhouse gas. Main industrial emissions of tetrafluoromethane besides hexafluoroethane are produced during production of aluminium using Hall-H√©roult process. CF4 also is produced as product of the breakdown of more complex compounds such as halocarbons.  Health risks  Due to its density, tetrafluoromethane can displace air, creating an asphyxiation hazard in inadequately ventilated areas.

(Suzhou Singapore International School is unrelated to the Shanghai Singapore International School, which shares the abbreviation SSIS.) Overview The school was established in September 1996 as an integral part of Suzhou Industrial Park's development, and has students of over forty-seven nationalities. The school's education system from Nursery to Grade Five is based on the IB PYP. Grades 6-10 are taught using the MYP, and students who meet the official MYP requirements upon completing the 10th grade receive an MYP certificate, after completing their Personal Projects or Exhibition Projects. Students entering their junior year choose to take either the HSD course, a system roughly analogous to North American high school programs; or the two-year IB Diploma course. Students enrolled in the High School Diploma program may take some IB classes, but are not eligible to receive an IB diploma upon graduation; instead, they receive IB certificates for their particular courses. The school moved from its old site at 82 Xing Han Street to its current campus, at 208 Zhong Nan Jie, in 2005. Senior Secondary Student Council The Senior Secondary Student Council (SSSC) is a form of student government led by one teacher supervisor and four student leaders. There are approximately twenty other council members from grades nine to twelve. The council is responsible for organizing various student events (though high school-targeted, many are available to all Secondary students), passing student opinion to the school administration, and participating in other activities to boost the overall communal experience in the school. In past years, changes enacted by the student council include the installing of an office/workspace for diploma students and constructing urinal walls.

Critical temperature is 439 ¬∞C (712 K) and critical pressure is 4.26 MPa. Plastic crystallinity The high temperature Œ± phase is known as a plastic crystal phase. Roughly speaking, the CBr4 are situated on the corners of the cubic unit cell as well as on the centers of its faces in an fcc arrangement. It was thought in the past that the molecules could rotate more or less freely (a 'rotor phase'), so that on a time average they would look like spheres. Recent work Coupled orientational and displacive degrees of freedom in the high-temperature plastic phase of the carbon tetrabromide Œ±-CBr4 Jacob C. W. Folmer, Ray L. Withers, T. R. Welberry, and James D. Martin. Physical Review B 77 in press has shown, however, that the molecules are restricted to only 6 possible orientations (Frenkel disorder). Moreover, they cannot take these orientations entirely independently from each other because in some cases the bromine atoms of neighboring molecules would point at each other leading to impossibly short distances. This rules out certain orientational combinations when two neighbor molecules are considered. Even for the remaining combinations displacive changes occur that better accommodate neighbor to neighbor distances. The combination of censored Frenkel disorder and displacive disorder implies a considerable amount of disorder inside the crystal which leads to highly structured sheets of diffuse scattered intensity in X-ray diffraction. In fact, it is the structure in the diffuse intensity that provides the information about the details of the structure. Chemical reactions In combination with triphenylphosphine, CBr4 is used in the Appel reaction, which converts alcohols to alkyl bromides. Similarly, CBr4 is used in combination with triphenylphosphine in the first step of the Corey-Fuchs reaction, which converts aldehydes into terminal alkynes. It is significantly less stable than lighter tetrahalomethane bromination using HBr or Br2. It can be also prepared by more economical reaction of tetrachloromethane with aluminium bromide at 100 ¬∞C. Uses It is used as a solvent for greases, waxes and oils, in plastic and rubber industry for blowing and vulcanization, further for polymerization, as a sedative and as an intermediate in manufacturing agrochemicals. Due to its non-flammability it is used as an ingredient in fire-resistant chemicals. It is also used for separating minerals because of its high density.

It is a temple mountain of combined brick, laterite and sandstone construction. The temple's name is a comparatively modern one meaning \\"turn the body\\". This reflects the common belief among Cambodians that funerals were conducted at the temple, with the ashes of the body being ritually rotated in different directions as the service progressed. The site Located just south of the East Baray, or eastern reservoir, Pre Rup is aligned on a north-south axis with the East Mebon temple, which is located on what was an artificial island in the baray. The East Mebon was also a creation of the reign of Rajendravarman. Pre Rup's extensive laterite and brick give it a pleasing reddish tone that is heightened by early morning and late afternoon sunlight. The temple has a square lay-out and two perimeter walls. The outer enclosure is a platform bounded by a laterite wall, 117 meters N-S by 127 meters E-W. A laterite causeway gives entry from the east; unfortunately, a modern road cuts across it. The four external gopuras are cross-shaped, having a central brick section (consisting of three rooms flanked by two independent passageways) and a sandstone vestibule on both sides. To either side inside the eastern gate is a group of three towers aligned north to south. One of the towers appears to have never been built or to have been dismantled later, however they are later additions, probably by Jayavarman V. Further ahead, through another gate, libraries lie to either side of the walkway on the second platform. Just before the entrance there is a stone \\"cistern\\", but scholars believe it was a basement for a Nandi bronze statue rather than being used for cremation ceremonies.Freeman and Jacques, 2006, pp.158-159 There is also a series of long distinct galleries running along each side, a distinctive feature of 10th century architecture that would be substituted by a continuous gallery from Ta Keo onward.Freeman and Jacques, 2006, p.160 The final squared pyramid, measuring 50 m at its base, rises in three steep tiers a dozen metres in height to a 35 m square platform at the summit. The lowest tier is symmetrically surrounded by 12 small shrines. At the top, five towers are arranged in a quincunx, one at each corner of the square and one in the center. Deities carved as bas-reliefs stand guard at either side of the central tower's eastern door; its other doors are false doors. The southwest tower once contained a statue of Lakshmi, the northwest tower a statue of Uma, the southeast tower a statue of Vishnu and the northeast tower a statue of Shiva. The last one has an inscription on doorjambs that dates from Jayavarman VI and is the only proof of his reign at Angkor. History Pre Rup was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, and it is probably located on a former shivaite ashram, built by Yasovarman I in the previous century.Freeman and Jacques, 2006, p.158 Perhaps it was standing at the centre of a new capital city built by Rajendravarman, with the southern dike of East Baray as northern city limit, but nothing of the dwellings survived and this \\"eastern city hypothesis\\" by Philippe Stern was never confirmed by archeological discoveries.Dumar√ßay et al., 2001, p.64 Gallery Pre rup final pyramid from E.jpgTerminal pyramid of Pre Rup (with the \\"cistern\\" foreground) Pre Rup, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 08.JPGView from the terminal pyramid Pre Rup Angkor central tower and prasats.jpgCentral prasat with two of the four other prasats visible in front Pre Rup, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 04.JPGFront view from the bottom Pre Rup, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 10.JPGView from the top Pre Rup, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 09.JPGCentral tower Pre Rup, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 02.JPGBuffalos at Pre Rup Pre Rup temple.jpgSouth side of Pre Rup temple Footnotes References  External links *M.A. Sullivan's photos of Pre Rup on Bluffton University website Category:Angkorian sites in Siem Reap Province Category:Hindu temples in Siem Reap Province ","title":"Pre Rup"},{"id":"2375363","text":"Hannibal G√≠sli Valdimarsson (13 January 1903 ‚Äì 1 September 1991) was a politician from Iceland.

Early life  Drowne was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1753. His father (also named Solomon, as was his father) was a merchant and was heavily involved in the civic affairs of the town. The Drowne family was also active in the First Baptist Church in America. Drowne's great-uncle Shem Drowne made the famous grasshopper weather vane atop of Faneuil Hall in Boston. In 1772, Drown witnessed the burning of a British ship in an event known as the Gasp√©e Affair. The following year, he graduated from the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the original name for Brown University) and received medical degrees from Dartmouth College and the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania).  American Revolutionary War  From 1776 to 1780, during the Revolutionary War, Drowne served as a surgeon in different hospitals and with different regiments throughout the Continental Army. On July 3, 1776, he narrowly escaped being captured by the British while gathering medical supplies in New York City. While stationed and treating soldiers at Rhode Island, he gained the favor of Marquis de Lafayette, the Comte de Rochambeau, the Comte d'Estaing and other French military officers supporting the American cause. In autumn 1780, he became surgeon on board the privateer sloop Hope owned by Joseph Nightingale and John Innis Clarke, keeping a diary that was later published. Drowne was discharged from the First Rhode Island Regiment on June 15, 1783, receiving a Badge of Merit for six years' faithful service.  After the war  In 1783, Drowne was elected to the Brown University (then still known as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ) board of fellows. He traveled to Europe, touring various medical facilities and schools and meeting Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson in Paris. Returning home, he practiced medicine in Providence, Rhode Island until 1788, when he settled in Marietta, Ohio with other war veterans. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790. As his health declined, Drowne moved from Marietta to Morgantown, Virginia (now West Virginia), Union, Pennsylvania and back to Rhode Island in 1801.  Later life  Drowne was a close friend of U.S. Senator Theodore Foster, whom he had met at college. In 1801 Drowne returned to Rhode Island and bought a farm next to Senator Foster in Foster, Rhode Island naming his farm Mt. Hygeia after the Greek goddess of health. Drowne used the farm for botanical research and named his driveway the \\"Appian Way\\". (As near as can be determined, Drown's home was built around 1806 as determined by Anselyn Lynch researching for the National Register of Historic Places - the house is on the Register). The first honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Brown Medical School was conferred upon Solomon Drowne in 1804. In 1811, Drowne was appointed Professor of Botany and Materia Medica in the medical department at Rhode Island College (now Brown University Medical School). He laid out the college's first botanical garden, became one of the original members of the Rhode Island Medical Society and one of the founders of the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry. With his son William Drowne, he co-wrote The Farmer's Guide, a thorough guide on husbandry and gardening, in 1824. Drowne's papers are now a part of Brown University's collection. Quotes The phrase \\"the whole Fraternity of Noise\\", describing the growing street noise in Philadelphia's downtown, is often misattributed to Benjamin Franklin, but actually originates in a letter from Drowne to his brother William while Solomon was in Philadelphia in 1774.Gillingham, H.

The function was held to celebrate the formation in Singapore of the Provisional Government of Free India by Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, who had left Germany six months earlier. Sonderreferat Indien, variously translated into English as, Special Bureau for India, Special India Bureau, or Section for Indian Affairs, was a section or bureau established within the Information Department of the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany in late spring 1941 in response to a proposal or memorandum written by the Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, who had arrived in Germany in early April of that year. The main function of the bureau was to aid Bose in his work, to liaise with Bose, and to mobilize an Indian Legion, comprising Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, to aid the German military in a future land invasion of India. A military intervention in India, one of the two major points in Bose's proposal, had at first received a lukewarm response from the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, but shortly afterwards it received the unexpected support of Adolf Hitler, who saw the battle for India as the natural aftermath of a successful German invasion of Russia and a chance to deliver the ultimate blow to the British Empire. Wilhelm Keppler, then an under-secretary of State in the German Foreign Office, who had direct access to Ribbentrop, was appointed director of the bureau. Most of the day-to-day work, however, became the responsibility of Adam von Trott zu Solz, an anti- Nazi official, who had some knowledge of India. Immediately under von Trott was his longtime friend Alexander Werth, who earlier had been imprisoned by the Nazis for a few years. The remaining staff in the bureau included F. J. Furtwaengler, A. F. Richter, H. T. Leipoldt, Prof Dr Alsdorf (an Indologist, who, during his tenure at the bureau, published Deutsch-Indische Geistesbeziehungen (German-Indian Intellectual Connections) (1942) and Indien und Ceylon (1943)), Mrs Kruse, Dr. Kretschmer, Baron von Zitzewitz, Baron von Lewinski, Mr Assmann, and Mr Trump. Bose was required to be addressed as \\"His Excellency\\" by order of the senior officials in the Foreign Office. In time, the bureau became a refuge for anti-Nazis, especially von Trott himself, who used his position as a cover for his \\"clandestine activities abroad.\\" Von Trott travelled to \\"Switzerland, Turkey, Scandinavia and throughout Nazi- occupied Europe\\" ostensibly on Special Bureau business, but in actuality attempting to reach out to German military officers opposing Nazi policies, and in the process risking his life. Von Trott would be executed by the Nazis in 1944. Bose was probably not aware of von Trott's anti-Nazi work, in part because Bose and von Trott did not develop a personal friendship or mutual trust, though some later scholars attempted to portray Bose as an anti-Nazi by suggesting a friendship. According to the historian Leonard A. Gordon, von Trott, \\"... feeling that Bose did not understand the Nazi tyranny and how it was destroying what was best in the German tradition, ... withheld his deeper sympathy and intimate friendship from Bose.\\" Notes References   * Category:Indian National Army Category:Subhas Chandra Bose ","title":"Special Bureau for India"},{"id":"2375408","text":"All About Eve () is a South Korean television drama which aired in 2000 on MBC that focused on two beautiful, young TV news reporters (portrayed by Chae Rim and Kim So-yeon) competing for the top position at the network they work for. Besides sharing a title and the premise of female rivalry, this drama has nothing to do with the film starring Bette Davis. Plot Sun-mi (Chae Rim) is a lovely college student who lives with her upper middle-class widowed father. She has a happy childhood with her best friend Woo-jin (Han Jae-suk). Life changes radically for Sun-mi when her father decides to support Young-mi (Kim So-yeon), a beautiful girl the same age as Sun-mi. Young-mi became an orphan when her father, an alcoholic who frequently abused her, dies in an accident while working for Mr. Jin's (Sun-mi's father) construction company. Young-mi has grown up in poverty, but she is not a humble person. She's arrogant, greedy and full of resentment. She initially becomes friends with Sun-mi, but eventually envies her for all she is and has, even Woo-jin's love. Young-mi becomes Sun-mi's rival in every aspect of her life. First, Young-mi steals Woo-jin from Sun-mi, then tries to take over her job at a very important TV network as they both dream to be famous news anchorwomen. She finally turns her eyes on Sun-mi's new boyfriend, Hyung-chul (Jang Dong-gun) one of the network's top executives, whom Sun-mi met during a trip to London. But Hyung-chul's love for Sun-mi is stronger than Young-mi's estimation. Meanwhile, Woo-jin suffers of a broken heart as Young-mi makes his life miserable and finally dumps him so she can chase Hyung-chul, even though it hurts her just as much since she does not love him and is only after him for her career's sake. The climax of the plot comes when a former lover of Young- mi appears and threatens to reveal her deepest secret should she not return to him: a dark past as a prostitute. Since the gangster did not succeed in his attempts, he decides to kill Young-mi. Woo-jin dies while saving her life. However, all of Young-mi's treachery is exposed. Losing everything and heartbroken because of Woo-jin's death, she attempts to commit suicide, but her efforts are frustrated when she is found unconscious by a group of nuns on the shore of the Han River. When Young-mi wakes up, she suffers from amnesia and has lost almost all memory of her past. The drama ends with a happy reconciliation between Young-mi and Sun-mi, who cries beside Young-mi forgiving her for the misunderstandings between them since they met. Finally, Hyung-chul swears eternal love and proposes to Sun-mi right in the middle of a street, asking her not to move to London.

Incidents of violence have included destruction of property, including vandalism; crimes against people, including kidnapping, stalking, assault, attempted murder, and murder; and crimes affecting both people and property, including arson and bombings. Anti-abortion extremists are considered a current domestic terrorist threat by the United States Department of Justice. Most documented incidents have occurred in the United States, though they have also occurred in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. G. Davidson Smith of Canadian Security Intelligence Service defined anti-abortion violence as single-issue terrorism. A study of 198287 violence considered the incidents \\"limited political\\" or \\"sub-revolutionary\\" terrorism. Background Anti-abortion violence is specifically directed towards people who or places which provide abortion. It is recognized as \\"single-issue terrorism\\". Incidents include vandalism, arson, and bombings of abortion clinics, such as those committed by Eric Rudolph (199698), and murders or attempted murders of physicians and clinic staff, as committed by James Kopp (1998), Paul Jennings Hill (1994), Scott Roeder (2009), Michael F. Griffin (1993), and Peter James Knight (2001). Those who engage in or support such actions defend the use of force with claims of justifiable homicide or defense of others in the interest of protecting the life of the fetus. David C. Nice, of the University of Georgia, describes support for anti-abortion violence as a political weapon against women's rights, one that is associated with tolerance for violence toward women. Numerous organizations have also recognized anti-abortion extremism as a form of Christian terrorism.   * The terrorism ahead: confronting transnational violence in the twenty-first century, Paul J.

Dyson, p 43 * Encyclopedia of terrorism, Cindy C. Combs, Martin W. Slann, p 13 * Armed for Life: The Army of God and Anti-Abortion Terror in the United States, Jennifer Jefferis, p 40 At least eleven murders occurred in the United States since 1990, as well as 41 bombings and 173 arsons at clinics since 1977. At least one murder occurred in Australia, as well several attempted murders in Canada. There were 1,793 abortion providers in the United States in 2008, as well as 197 abortion providers in Canada in 2001. The National Abortion Federation reported between 1,356 and 13,415 incidents of picketing at United States providers each year from 1995 to 2014. The Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was passed in 1994 to protect reproductive health service facilities and their staff and patients from violent threats, assault, vandalism, and blockade. The law (18 U.S.C. sec. 248) also provides the same level of legal protection to all pregnancy-related medical clinics, including anti-abortion counseling centers; it also applies to use of threatening tactics directed towards churches and places of worship. State, provincial, and local governments have also passed similar laws designed to afford legal protection of access to abortion in the United States and Canada. By country = Australia = *July 16, 2001: Peter James Knight attacked a clinic in Melbourne, Australia, shooting and killing the security guard, Steven Rogers. Knight brought ropes and gags into the clinic along with 16 litres of kerosene, intending to burn all 15 staff and 26 patients to death. Knight was charged and was sentenced to life in prison on November 19, 2002. *January 6, 2009: A firebombing using Molotov cocktails was attempted at a medical clinic in Mosman Park, Western Australia. Faulty construction of the bombs limited damage to a single external burnt area, though if successful damage would have been severe. It is believed that the individuals who made the attack were responsible for graffiti \\"baby killers\\" on the site, indicating an anti-abortion reason for the attack. The site turned out to in fact not be an abortion clinic, though the attackers most likely were not aware of this.. = Canada = Attempted murder Violence has also occurred in Canada, where at least three doctors have been attacked to date. The physicians were part of a pattern of attacks, which targeted providers in Canada and upstate New York (including the fatal shooting of Barnett Slepian of New York). All victims were shot, or shot at, in their homes with a rifle, at dusk or in the morning, in late October or early November over a multi-year period. There is speculation that the timing of the shootings is related to the Canadian observance of Remembrance Day. A joint Canadian-FBI task force investigating the shootings was formed in December 1997‚Äîthree years after the first attack. An official of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police complained that the Canadian Government was not adequately financing the investigation. He said he requested more funds in July that would raise its budget to $250,000. Federal officials rejected the request on October 15, a week before Slepian was killed.Rhode, David. Sniper attacks on doctors create climate of fear in Canada, New York Times, October 29, 1998. Retrieved August 29, 2011. In 2001, James Kopp, an American citizen and resident was charged with the murder of Slepian and the attempted murder of Short; some speculate that Kopp was responsible for the other shootings. *November 8, 1994: In 1994, a sniper fired two bullets into the home of Garson Romalis, a gynaecologist of Vancouver, British Columbia who was eating breakfast. One hit his thigh, destroyed some of his muscles, broke his femur and damaged his femoral artery. Romalis saved his own life by using his bathrobe belt as a tourniquet. Romalis had become more outspoken about abortion rights since he was shot, citing the harm done to women by illegal abortion and the thousands of cases of septic abortion that came to his hospital in residency.Romalis, Garson.

The Morgentaler Clinic on Harbord Street in Toronto was firebombed during the night by two people (caught on security camera) using gasoline and a firework to set off the explosion. The next day, clinic management announced that the firebombing failed to prevent any abortions, since all scheduled abortions were carried out in alternative locations. A portion of the Toronto Women's Bookstore, next door, was damaged. No one was hurt but the building had to be demolished. As a result of the arson, the Ontario government decided to spend $420,000 on improved security for abortion clinics. At the time, all four free-standing clinics in Ontario were in Toronto. The government wanted to gather information about activities by anti-abortion sympathizers; at the time, law enforcement agencies in Canada did not collect statistics about harassment and violence against abortion providers, their clinics, or their clients. Six months after the attack, the Toronto Police Force still had not made any progress in uncovering the attackers, any leads on suspects lead to dead-ends. =New Zealand= * Circa 1999: In the late 1990s, Graeme White was found guilty and sent to prison for tunneling into an abortion clinic with what the police described as \\"incendiary devices\\". * 1976: An arson attack was carried out at the Auckland Medical Aid Centre, which was estimated to cause $100,000 in damages to the facility.

Specific incidents =Army of God= The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security's joint Terrorism Knowledge Base, identify the Army of God as an underground terrorist organization active in the United States. It was formed in 1982, and is responsible for a substantial amount of anti-abortion violence. The group has committed property crimes, acts of kidnapping, attempted murder, and murder. While sharing a common ideology and tactics, members claim to rarely communicate; to avoid risk of information leaking to outside sources. In August 1982, three men identifying as the Army of God kidnapped Hector Zevallos (a doctor and clinic owner) and his wife, Rosalee Jean, holding them for eight days and released them unharmed.Baird-Windle, Patricia & Bader, Eleanor J., (2001), Targets of Hatred: Anti-Abortion Terrorism, New York, St. Martin's Press, In 1993, Shelly Shannon, an Army of God member, admitted to the attempted murder of George Tiller.

Paul Jennings Hill was found guilty of the murder of both John Britton and clinic escort James Barrett. The Army of God published a \\"Defensive Action Statement\\" signed by more than two dozen supporters of Hill, saying that \\"whatever force is legitimate to defend the life of a born child is legitimate to defend the life of an unborn child... if in fact Paul Hill did kill or wound abortionist John Britton and clinic assistants James Barrett and Mrs. Barrett, his actions are morally justified if they were necessary for the purpose of defending innocent human life\\". The AOG claimed responsibility for Eric Robert Rudolph's 1997 shrapnel bombing of abortion clinics in Atlanta and Birmingham. The organization embraces its description as terrorist. =Physician \\"wanted\\" posters= In the late 1990s, an organization called American Coalition of Life Activists (ACLA) was accused of implicitly advocating violence by its publication on its \\"Nuremberg Files\\" website of wanted-style posters, which featured a photograph of a physician who performed abortions along with a monetary reward for any information that would lead to his \\"arrest, conviction, and revocation of license to practice medicine\\". The ACLA's website described these physicians as war criminals and accused them of committing \\"crimes against humanity\\". The web site also published names, home addresses, telephone numbers, and other personal information regarding abortion providers‚Äîhighlighting the names of those who had been wounded and striking out those of who had been killed. George Tiller's name was included on this list along with many others. The site was accused of being a thinly- veiled hit list intended to incite violence; others claimed that it was protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. In 2002, after a prolonged debate, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the \\"posters\\" constituted an illegal threat. Reactions =Anti-abortion reactions= Anti-abortion organizations including Family Research Council, Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Susan B. Anthony List, American Life League, Students for Life of America, Pro-Life Action League and 40 Days For Life condemned the 2009 murder of Kansas doctor George Tiller. In a 2009 press release, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry issued a statement calling for peaceful protests to expose abortion providers. According to Media Matters and the Colorado Independent, however, Terry has also led apparently contradictory public prayers that an abortion provider would \\"[convert] to God\\" or that \\"calamity [would] strike him\\". Terry added that he hoped the \\"baby killer would be tried and executed for crimes against humanity\\". The doctor targeted by Terry's prayers said to the press, \\"He's clearly inciting someone, anyone, to kill me\\"; a spokesman responded that Terry only meant that \\"God would deal with [the doctor]\\". Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue, accused \\"those in the abortion-providing industry\\" of committing most of the violence in an attempt to discredit the antiabortion movement. He defended his organization's use of inflammatory rhetoric, saying: \\"This whole thing isn't about violence. It's all about silence ‚Äì silencing the Christian message. That's what they want.\\" He also stated, \\"Our inflammatory rhetoric is only revealing a far more inflammatory truth.\\" Media depictions of anti-abortion violence ;Literature *The Fourth Procedure, a 1995 novel by Stanley Pottinger, is a medical thriller and murder mystery that depicts anti-abortion violence in its plot.

Meanwhile, anti-abortion activists had condemned the killing of Tiller that inspired the episode, but praised the episode for being \\"outright pro-life\\", with Dave Andrusko of the National Right to Life Committee saying, \\"[I]t occurred to me as I listened in utter astonishment that each of these observations could have been presented in a way that was artificial, forced, or (as so often is the case with network portraits of pro- lifers) something that you would expect from an idiot.

Character biography =Background= Roslin's mother is revealed to have also died from breast cancer, and Roslin speaks of her mother's life and death in Season 4's episode \\"Faith\\". In \\"Daybreak\\", Roslin is shown to have had two sisters, one of whom is pregnant, and a father prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The morning after her sister's baby shower, two police officers inform Roslin that her family had been struck by a drunk driver and killed the previous night. Several months later, Roslin has become somewhat of a recluse and agrees to a blind date after turning down a position alongside her friend, Caprica City Mayor Richard Adar, who is running for president. Though her blind date turns out to be a younger man who is a former student of hers, Roslin has dinner with him and sleeps with him later that night. She later calls and accepts the position with Adar, saying she will stick with it \\"to the very end.\\" =Cylon attack and escape= Just prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies, Roslin is the Secretary of Education under President Adar. Roslin appears to have been in a romantic relationship with Adar, which fell apart when Roslin successfully defused large-scale teachers strike. Adar (who assumed Roslin would fail at breaking the strike-through peaceful means) demands Roslin's resignation, citing the fact that he wants to use force against the teachers in order to intimidate the other unions on Caprica from striking. Roslin refuses to resign and vows to fight for her job, as she leaves for a doctor's appointment and the decommissioning ceremony for the Galactica. At her doctor's appointment, Roslin is told that she has breast cancer. Roslin attends the Galactica ceremony, and upon leaving, the Cylons attack the Twelve Colonies. During the attack, Roslin responds to \\"Case Orange\\", the official Colonial Government emergency automated signal, and is informed that she is the highest ranking surviving member of the Presidential line of succession. She was in fact the 43rd in line of succession, and is sworn in as President. =Early presidency= Her first actions include organizing all FTL-capable ships together and convincing Commander William Adama to abandon a retaliatory attack on the Cylons. President Roslin and Billy Keikeya, her aide/press secretary/chief of staff, establish a working office space aboard her transport, renamed Colonial One (which the series' production team intentionally designed to resemble Air Force One). She immediately clashes with Commander Adama, the ranking Colonial military officer. They make an uneasy truce ‚Äî that Roslin will remain President of the Colonies but that any and all military decisions will rest with Adama. For the first few weeks, she acts as the sole voice of government, attending meetings and issuing orders alone. Soon after the conflict depicted in the episode \\"Bastille Day\\", Roslin bows to popular pressure and agrees to establish a new Quorum of Twelve. During the first meeting of the new Quorum, council member Tom Zarek moves to nominate a vice-president. The military and Roslin see this as a bid by Zarek (who is a convicted political terrorist) to gain the vice- presidency so that he can have Roslin assassinated and assume control over the government. In response, Roslin recruits an old political ally, Wallace Gray, to run for Vice-President, but he fares poorly against the well-connected Zarek. After he gives a stirring speech to the news media, it becomes clear that Dr. Gaius Baltar has become a popular individual in the fleet, and Roslin pressures Gray to drop out so that Baltar can enter the race. With Baltar in the race, the vote comes down to a 6-6 deadlock in the Quorum, and President Roslin breaks the tie in Baltar's favor. By the close of the first season, the soft-spoken Roslin has become a formidable and often ruthless leader who not only authorizes the use of torture against Cylon agents, but also orders their deaths by way of \\"airlocking\\" (flushing them out of an airlock into space). =Prophecies and arrest= During the first season, Roslin treats her breast cancer through the use of a herbal drug called chamalla. After beginning the treatment, she begins to experience visions, which coincide with the Pythian prophecies contained in the ancient scriptures of Kobol. She comes to believe, based on the Pythian prophecies, that she is the spiritual leader of the Colonials and will lead the fleet to Earth. These beliefs begin to heavily influence her decisions as President, including sending Kara Thrace back to Caprica against Adama's orders, in order to retrieve the mythical Arrow of Apollo in accordance with the Pythian prophecies. As a result of this action, Commander Adama has her removed from power and thrown in the brig for breaking their agreement and interfering in military matters. During her imprisonment, Adama is shot, and Tigh takes charge of the fleet. With the aid of Lee Adama and Tom Zarek, Roslin escapes, and convinces a large part of the fleet to abandon Galactica and join her instead. As Roslin begins searching for the Tomb of Athena on Kobol, Adama attempts to find her and reunite the fleet. After being joined by Adama, and with the help of Sharon Agathon, the group manages to find the tomb. With the Arrow of Apollo, the tomb reveals clues to Earth's location. After reconciling with Commander Adama, she is reinstated as President. =Declining health= After Roslin's reinstatement, her condition begins to worsen. She is told that she has, at most, about a month to live. Shortly thereafter, Admiral Helena Cain of Battlestar Pegasus and Commander Adama came to the brink of a shooting war with each other over Cain's disregard for civil liberties and the civilian fleet. Roslin realizes that Cain does not accept her as the true President, and with her health rapidly deteriorating, convinces Adama to have Cain assassinated pending a major operation against a Cylon fleet, with Cain secretly planning the same action against Adama. Though neither is ultimately willing to follow through, Cain is still killed by a Cylon she had imprisoned and tortured, and Roslin promotes Adama to Admiral. Weeks after the Pegasus joins the fleet, Roslin is admitted to the Galactica's sickbay, on the verge of death. At the height of her illness, Roslin has a flashback of an encounter between Baltar and Number Six prior to the Cylon attack, but is not able to fully process her memories. As part of these flashbacks, it is revealed that President Adar had demanded Roslin's resignation due to a conflict between the two regarding her efforts in resolving a labor dispute, her position effectively secured by the Cylon attack and resulting governmental upheaval. As Roslin nears death, her life is saved by the apparent curative properties discovered in the blood of the half- human/half-Cylon fetus carried by Sharon Agathon, whose pregnancy Roslin had previously believed should be terminated. Ostensibly cured of her cancer, she returns to her duties. =Administration strains= After recovering and processing her memories of Baltar and Six, Roslin asks Baltar to resign his post as Vice President. His pride already wounded by the letter Roslin left him in the event of her death regarding his ascension to the position of \\"President\\", Baltar refuses. Roslin says that she will never give him another chance to do so. Following her return to duty, Roslin discovered she had fallen behind in her work, and sought to again regularize internal trade within the Fleet. To these ends, she sought to curtail rampant black market trading that had spread through the fleet which Lee Adama began investigating. However, he in the end reported to Roslin that their system would never be perfect, and there would always be some unavoidable black market trading in the Fleet. Lee killed the leader of the established black market network (an unscrupulous man that had the network dealing in drugs, killing with impunity, and engaged in the sexual exploitation of children, etc.), and let the survivors continue black market trading with the warning that if any of these unsavoury actions were continued, he would destroy them all. Roslin was less than happy that Lee had made this decision and that trade could not be totally regulated, but begrudgingly accepted it. Furthermore, Roslin suffers more problems when her longtime aide Billy is killed during a hostage crisis regarding a group of anti-Cylon activists who seek the death of Cylon traitor Sharon Agathon. Billy is replaced by a new aide, a woman named Tory Foster. Unlike Billy, Tory is shown to be a cold-blooded realist and supports Roslin in her most controversial action in the series, when she fakes the death of Sharon and Helo's baby and orders the child be secretly adopted by a female fleet member. =Run-up to election campaign= When a young Gemenese woman stowed away to the Galactica in order to have her pregnancy terminated, President Roslin insisted that the girl was within her rights to control her own body; abortion had been legal under colonial law before the Cylon attack, and Roslin considered this law to be still in effect. Roslin commented that she had been fighting during the course of her entire political career in support of pro-choice policies; however, Admiral Adama reminded her of the day following the attacks on the Twelve Colonies, when she told him that the human race, in order to survive, would have to retreat and focus more on reproduction. She then conferred with Dr Baltar, who confirmed that if the Fleet population continued its constant rate of decline, the human race would become extinct within 18 years. Subsequently, she reluctantly put forth an Executive Order banning the interference in any further pregnancies. The Gemenese girl's pregnancy had been terminated before the order was announced so neither she nor Dr Cottle could be held criminally liable. This decision undoubtedly weighed heavily in the upcoming elections for the new Presidency, especially since Dr Baltar, while admitting that he had to support her decision as a member of her administration, publicly announced his private objection to the ban and announced his candidacy for president. This allowed Baltar to present himself as the \\"scientific rationalist\\" versus Roslin being seen as a religious as well as a political leader. While the Gemenese and Sagittaron colonies are more religiously fundamental, the rest of the Twelve Colonies are shown as more secular. However, this issue was not enough, and Baltar trailed Roslin heavily in all polls until a new, habitable planet was discovered. Baltar leapt on the issue, prompted by Zarek and Number Six, to push for colonization of the planet as a wedge issue to win the election. President Roslin continued to push for the search for Earth as a final settlement. As most of the people wished for land under their feet and a roof over their heads that wasn't the deck of a starship, Baltar gained considerably in the polls. =Election= Vice-President Baltar and his political advisor Tom Zarek were able to successfully capitalize on the colonization issue, and public opinion swung in favour of settling the planet, christened New Caprica, and electing Baltar. During the night of the election, vote totals remained very close until approximately 5 hours after polls had closed, at which point Baltar was leading Roslin by roughly 5000 votes, with three ships yet to have their votes tallied. At that point, Roslin's campaign manager secretly called on Colonel Saul Tigh, who was among the military officers supervising vote-counting aboard Galactica. Tigh then signalled Petty-Officer Anastasia Dualla, who left the room and commandeered an incoming ballot box, replacing it with one apparently prepared ahead of time and containing forged votes which favoured President Roslin. When these votes were tallied, President Roslin was announced as having won re-election. Tom Zarek was suspicious of the results, but Baltar personally assured him that Roslin would not engage in electoral fraud. The small conspiracy quickly unravelled, however, when Lieutenant Felix Gaeta noticed that the forged ballots had Vice- President Baltar's first name spelt correctly (Gaeta knew that the ship in question had a set of misprinted ballots). He brought this to the attention of Tigh, who insisted that he would handle the situation, after which Gaeta grew suspicious and personally alerted Admiral Adama. Adama, in turn, privately informed Roslin, who then herself confessed to authorizing her campaign manager's subterfuge. Adama eventually convinced Roslin that, despite the likelihood that a Baltar presidency would be \\"disastrous,\\" they should announce that there had been a \\"tabulation error\\" and allow Baltar to take office rather than betraying their principles. =On New Caprica= After leaving office, Roslin settled on New Caprica. She resumes her old occupation as a school teacher and aids in the care of Sharon Agathon's half-Cylon, half- human baby, Hera/Isis. During this period, the relationship between Roslin and Adama evolves. During Adama's sole visit to the colony, Roslin shares her dream of building a cabin in the mountains of New Caprica with Adama, and the two are shown spending the night smoking a native herb, and talking about what is to become of the fleet. But after a year on New Caprica, the Cylons discover the colony, which under Baltar's leadership immediately surrenders. While Roslin does not actively participate in the underground resistance movement, Colonel Tigh subordinates himself and his insurgent force to Roslin and Vice President Tom Zarek's de facto government-in-waiting. Roslin and her aide, Tory Foster, make a detailed list of the colonists who collaborate with the Cylons for later use, if and when the Cylons are ever driven off the planet. When Tigh orders the use of suicide bombers, Roslin is arrested on suspicion of aiding in Tigh's decision. Roslin is freed by Baltar, who knowing that Roslin would never approve of such tactics, attempts, unsuccessfully, to get her to join him in jointly denouncing Tigh's actions. Days later, Roslin is re-arrested and nearly executed alongside a large group of suspected resistance members, but is saved by the resistance. One of the other suspected resistance members is Zarek, who used the opportunity to confirm that she tried to steal the presidential election. When she admitted she did, he told her he wished she had gone through with it. During the final battle of New Caprica, Roslin evacuates aboard Colonial One, referring to it as \\"my ship\\" to Vice President Zarek who defers to her, tacitly acknowledging her inevitable return to the office. =After New Caprica= Aboard Colonial One Tory Foster apologetically informs Roslin that Isis/Hera and her adoptive mother cannot be accounted for and are believed to have been either killed or recaptured during the exodus from New Caprica. After the fleet is reunited after their escape from New Caprica, Vice President Tom Zarek ascends to the presidency in light of Baltar's abandonment of the office during the exodus. Zarek agrees that as soon as a new Quorum of Twelve is elected is found, he will name Roslin as his VP, then step down, making her again President, as he knows he could not continue as President without Adama's support. For his cooperation, Zarek asks for only a place in Roslin's new administration; but in appreciation of his refusing to cooperate with Baltar on New Caprica, Roslin says she will name him the new VP which clearly surprises Zarek. Before Roslin can take office, however, Zarek in conjunction with Saul Tigh forms a retribution tribunal known as \\"The Circle\\", empowering them to investigate allegations of collaboration and to summarily try and execute the collaborators, all in secret and without normal due process protections. When Roslin and Adama find out, they halt the Circle proceedings. Zarek justifies his actions saying that the fleet needs quick justice to prevent chaos and that Roslin's new mandate needs to start with clean hands. After she takes office, Roslin declares a general amnesty for all Cylon collaborators and establishes a Truth and Reconciliation Committee to bring the fleet together. Upon meeting a delegation from the Cylons (Gaius Baltar, a Brother Cavil, a Number 3 and Boomer), after discovering the \\"Temple of the Five\\" on a newly discovered planet (nicknamed the \\"Algae planet\\", due to its large swathes of algae), Roslin's theft of the hybrid baby Hera is revealed. There is a stand-off between the humans and Cylons, complicated by the planetary system's star being on the brink of going supernova. Roslin's religious insights prove useful when it comes time to determine what parts of the Temple's inscriptions relate to Earth, and perhaps what parts relate to the Cylons. She starts to see that there may be more than a single purpose for the Temple and that its role in Colonial religious doctrine might not be the only one ‚Äî perhaps it had messages for both the Cylons and humanity. During the escape from the Algae Planet, Baltar is captured by the Colonials. Following his capture, Baltar is subjected to sleep-deprivation, force-feeding, and a radical form of hallucinogen-based interrogation, and then offered the possibility of escaping execution in exchange for cooperation, as Adama, Tigh and Roslin seek to learn any clues to Earth's location. When all of these stratagems fail, Baltar asks for a fair trial. Roslin rejects Adama's suggestion that Baltar be made to \\"simply disappear\\", and orders him to be given a fair trial for his crimes, even after a warning from Tom Zarek that doing so will provoke dangerous unrest among the fleet's civilian and military populations alike. =Returning health troubles= During Baltar's trial, it is revealed that Roslin's cancer has reappeared and that she is once again taking chamalla. Lee Adama, acting as part of Baltar's defence, argues that this makes her an illegitimate witness in Baltar's trial because of chamalla's hallucinogenic effects. Baltar is acquitted, leaving Roslin with nothing but her secret illness exposed. She begins to experience shared visions (with Sharon Agathon and Number Six) which involve the human-cylon hybrid child, Hera. =Route of the gods is challenged= In the opening fourth season premiere He That Believeth In Me, the return of Kara Thrace, presumed dead by the fleet for two months, alarms and angers Roslin, as she is convinced that Thrace's resurrection verifies her as a Cylon. Thrace's own conviction that she has visited Earth leads to conflict when Kara insists that the route given to the fleet by the Eye of Jupiter is false, and that they are pulling away from Earth's correct route, causing her great pain. Panicking, she attempts to force Roslin to turn back by infiltrating her quarters and aiming a gun at her head. She is apprehended, but not before Kara gives Roslin the chance to shoot her. Roslin fires the gun but misses at close range. Adama later chastises Roslin, accusing her of not trusting Kara because she fears she will lose the people to a new \\"visionary\\" and die alone, powerless. =Deterioration, resting demons, and redemption= As Roslin begins to deteriorate further, she discovers that the continued political intervention of Lee Adama (now a member of the Quorum) has placed a strain on her ability to maintain her normal routines of classified police sanctions concerning fleetwide security, as well as her relentless bias against Baltar. She briefly bonds with a cancer-ridden patient, Emily, who shares with Roslin views on death before succumbing to her illness. Roslin then resumes her duties. When Kara Thrace returns to the fleet in a crippled Cylon Basestar, Laura, along with Baltar, is invited aboard by a rebel Cylon crew, who are on the run and intent on finding D'anna (Number Three), who knows the identities of the Final Five Cylons. Roslin is taken hostage along with Baltar and several Galactica pilots when Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon guns down Natalie, a more assertive copy of Number Six and the leader of the rebel Cylons, in a misguided attempt to thwart the vision she shares with Roslin from coming to pass. As the Cylon Basestar jumps towards the location of the Cylon Resurrection Hub, Roslin begins to experience visions of her impending death, and gradually begins to learn she has taken much in her life for granted, including the love of William Adama and his family. Roslin gives the go-ahead for a mission to destroy the Cylon hub and retrieve the resurrected D'anna, but also requests that she be given exclusive access to her, violating an agreement between the humans and Cylons to mutually question D'anna. During the assault on the Hub by the human and Cylon alliance, Baltar is severely injured in an explosion, and in a delirious state of self-loathing and desperation, he confesses to Roslin that he is to blame for the attacks on the Colonies. Roslin, initially angry, attempts to murder Baltar by removing his dressings and allowing him to bleed to death, but her conscience tears at her until she relents, and she chooses to spare her enemy rather than die with blood on her hands. The Basestar returns to the fleet, where Laura reunites with Adama and finally declares her love for him, to which he replies, \\"About time\\". =\\"Earth\\"= Upon returning to the fleet with Adama, Laura does not immediately take back her role as President, instead of watching Lee Adama take full control of the role and handling a hostage crisis initiated by D'anna. After the location of Earth has been verified from the co-ordinates supplied by Kara Thrace's Viper, an emotional Laura orders the fleet to jump to Earth, where the crew discover to their horror that the planet is a nuclear wasteland and virtually uninhabitable. Laura then suffers a crisis of faith due to the guilt of leading her people on a pointless journey. She burns the book of Pythia, chooses to stop taking her cancer medication, and also develops a romantic relationship with Admiral Adama. During Tom Zarek and Felix Gaeta's attempted coup d'√©tat and mutiny, Laura evades capture initially because the plotters are unaware that she had secretly taken up residence in Adama's quarters. She is shepherded by loyalists to an abandoned auxiliary docking port after attempting to make a broadcast denouncing the mutiny. From the docking port, she is spirited away to the rebel Cylon baseship. The rebel Cylons remain loyal to Laura and form a de facto government in exile around her. They originally try to jump away, but after she makes a passionate speech in support of Adama, they decide to stay and a Two even helps her make a broadcast about the mutiny through Gaeta's jamming. Her heart is broken by Zarek's false report that Adama and Tigh had been killed, but her spirit is not; she vows to defeat the mutineers and commands her Cylon forces to attack Galactica. Gaeta tries to jump away instead, but Tyrol disables Galactica's FTL drive. Faced with having to fight Roslin and lose more lives, Gaeta stands down and Adama and his loyalists retake the ship moments later. Roslin is visibly relieved when Adama contacts her to let her know he's in command again and to stand down and Roslin (and even a Number Eight) breaks down crying and the two are joyfully reunited later. In the wake of the failed coup, during which most members of the Quorum of the Twelve are assassinated, Roslin appoints Councilman Lee Adama as Vice President and agrees to his suggestion of a reorganized Quorum based not on the original Twelve Colonies, but on representatives from each ship in the fleet, including the rebel Cylon basestar whose councilman, Sonja Six, she warmly congratulates on her election to the new Quorum and welcomes into the government. She also develops some form of mental link between herself, Caprica Six, Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon and the child Hera. This resulted in her collapse when during \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\", when she somehow sensed that Hera was taken by Boomer to Cavil. This link may be connected to a comment made by Ellen Tigh about something manipulating the entire events happening in the Battlestar Universe. Ever since her collapse, Roslin has been in sickbay and is clearly not doing well. She convinces Adama that he has to abandon Galactica which is now falling apart. After hearing Cottle and Ishay discussing Adama's planned rescue mission of Hera, Roslin, when alone, gets out of bed, gets dressed and makes her way to the hangar to volunteer for the rescue mission despite hardly being able to walk. She asks Adama jokingly if he was planning on going without her and he accepts her help on the mission. She is given injections to keep herself on her feet for two days, but is warned it will use up what little life she has left. With both she and Vice President Adama taking part in the mission, Roslin appoints attorney and political kingmaker Romo Lampkin as a reluctant acting president; she and/or Admiral Adama similarly brevets Lieutenant Louis Hoshi to the rank of Rear Admiral and commander of the fleet. During the battle, Roslin serves in sickbay and helps Hera avoid Cavil and other Centurions that have boarded Galactica as well as finally realizing the truth of her Opera House vision. After Hera is rescued and the Cylon colony is left to fall into a black hole, Kara Thrace inputs a set of coordinates into the navigational computer and the Galactica jumps far away to a habitable blue planet with a moon. The recognizable continent of Africa is seen clearly from orbit. The planet is our own Earth. Joined later by the rest of the colonial fleet, the colonials decide to settle on the new world where primitive humans already live. Roslin, while sitting with Adama, asks him what the name of the planet should be, to which he replies \\"Earth\\", naming it after the devastated planet they found some time ago since this new world has ended up being the sanctuary they were always looking for. Now with Roslin close to death, Adama asks Roslin if she wants to see the wildlife of the planet closer and he then takes her on a flight across the African continent in a Raptor. During the flight, she utters her last words, \\"So much... life,\\" and dies peacefully. Heartbroken, Adama puts his wedding ring on Roslin's finger. This fulfils the Mosaic prophecy that the anointed leader will \\"guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland\\" but the leader will not live to enter the new land. Adama buries her on the hilltop where he intends to build their cabin and visits her grave often. Lampkin is last seen exercising leadership among the settlers. Development Unlike most of the other central human characters at the start of the series, Roslin has no direct analogue in the original 1978 program, though a character named Siress Tinia (played by Ina Balin) featured in the original series episode \\"Baltar's Escape\\". In that episode, Tinia is a member of the Quorum of Twelve, assigned to shadow Adama as an \\"advisor\\" and the Quorum's official representative. She sometimes comes into conflict with Adama and challenges his decisions, much like Laura Roslin does with Commander William Adama, though the two eventually grow to respect each other. While it may be a coincidence, her name is an amalgam of the forenames of the U.S. First Ladies in 2003 and 1978: Laura Bush and Rosalynn Carter. According to McDonnell, influences for the character included Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton.Battlestar Galacticast: Mary McDonnell at ECCC 2019 Executive producer Ronald D. Moore called Roslin \\"vital to the life of this series, as opposed to the original series.\\" The approach of the reimagined series required a substantial political apparatus so that the military led by Adama would not take primacy in civilian life. It would also allow the writers to put the military and civilian leadership into conflict.

Accident description The Boeing 737, registered C-GQPW, taxied from the gate at Calgary International Airport at 7:35 AM and proceeded to take off on runway 34, carrying five crew members and 114 passengers. At 7:42 AM, a loud popping sound was heard 20 seconds into the takeoff run. The aircraft began to vibrate and veer to the left, and a fire broke out in the rear of the aircraft. The pilot, Stan Fleming, managed to abort the take-off. An emergency evacuation was ordered as the fire spread throughout the aircraft. Five people were seriously injured and 22 suffered minor injuries, but no one was killed. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire. The Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) determined that an uncontained failure of the left engine thirteenth stage compressor disc had occurred. Debris from the engine punctured a fuel cell, resulting in the fire. The disc failure was the result of fatigue cracking. The fire was attributed to a faulty compressor disc that blew apart, rupturing the fuel tanks. This incident was similar to the cause of the British Airtours Flight 28M disaster that claimed 55 lives in 1985.

He played as a right-handed middle order batsman and right arm off-break bowler. He was the first Indian \\"super sub\\" in One Day International (ODI) cricket. He played large part of his career for his home Andhra Pradesh in first class cricket and then went on to play for India between 2005-06. He also opened the batting for India in a one-day series in Zimbabwe. He has a brother Gnaneshwara Rao who has played for Kochi Tuskers Kerala in IPL. He also played for Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat between 2007 and 2015 and in between came back to play for Andhra between 2009 and 2012 and came back again for a single match in 2017 season. International career Venugopal Rao started his career playing for Andhra Pradesh in domestic matches and impressed Indian selectors with a First-class average of over 50 and List-A average of around 40. This included one innings in the Ranji Trophy for South Zone where he scored 223 against a touring England A team which included Test bowlers such as Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff. He consequently earned a call up to the national side for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in July 2005, after captain Sourav Ganguly was dropped from the team.

He was unable to establish a position in the team, and did not play any further ODIs after May 2006. His poor domestic form further lead him to out of contention for national team.

The densitometer is basically a light source aimed at a photoelectric cell. It determines the density of a sample placed between the light source and the photoelectric cell from differences in the readings. Modern densitometers have the same components, but also have electronic integrated circuitry for better reading. Types *Transmission densitometers that measure transparent materials *A transmission densitometer used to measure transparent surface measures color transparencies film & transparent substrate are some example of common transparent surface measures.. *Reflection densitometers that measure light reflected from a surface. Photography applications Some modern types of German manufacture are capable of both types of measurements selectable by a switch. They are used in film photography to measure densities of negatives with the switch in the \\"T\\" (Transmission) position and the saturation of a resulting print in the \\"R\\" position. Such measurements enable the photographer to choose the right photo paper and the correct exposure, obviating experiments with test strips. Once the papers and darkroom have been calibrated, the first print from a previously measured negative is a success at once.

She is the only Soviet rhythmic gymnast to win two all-around world titles, which she won in 1977 and 1979. Her mother, Albina, was her coach. Her success influenced the further development of rhythmic gymnastics in Kiev.  Career  Deriugina was born in a family of Ukrainian athletes from Eastern Ukraine, a female gymnast, Albina Deriugina, and a pentathlon athlete, Ivan Deriuhin. At age ten in 1968, Deriugina entered the National Ballet School. From 1976 to 1980 she was a student of the Kiev National Institute of Physical Culture. Deriugina was a member of the Soviet rhythmic gymnastics squad from 1972 until her retirement from the sport in 1982. She was then appointed the Ukrainian national coach. Deriugina was in charge of the RG technical organizing committee as competition director from 1988 to 1992. At her Kiev school, she and her mother train forty high level gymnasts. Since 1992, they also organize an annual rhythmic tournament, the Deriugina Cup. Deriugina was a judge at the 1988 Seoul and 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. She was involved in a large judging scandal that took place at the 2000 European Championships in Zaragoza, Spain. Video was used to prove that she and five other judges, Natalia Stepanova (Belarus), Gabriele Stummer (Austria), Galina Marjina (Latvia), Ursula Sohlenkamp (Germany) and Natalia Lashtsinkaya (Russia), were guilty of discriminating against Olena Vitrychenko of Ukraine, in comparison to scores given to other gymnasts. In the end, the six guilty judges were suspended for one year and they were excluded from the judging course in Rome. For the 2000 Sydney Olympics, those countries had to choose another judge who met the requirements of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Gymnastique. This was the first time in the sport's history that such massive inappropriate behaviour was documented and penalized.  Personal life  Deriugina was married to Oleh Blokhin, a Ukrainian soccer striker and coach who was European Footballer of the Year in 1975. They have a daughter together named Iryna Blokhina, a pop artist socialite and as well as choreographing for the Deriugina's students.

At school, Loung was ridiculed for her poor English and her ethnic Cambodian facial features. Her belly still bloated from malnutrition, she felt she wasn't pretty. She also continued to be plagued by memories of Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge. Even as she began to put the past behind her, she could not entirely because her brother refused to do so. Nonetheless, Loung's quality of life was a lot higher than her prospects had she remained in Cambodia; she even earned a full scholarship to college. Loung was often haunted by her torturous past but finally comes to terms with it when she visits Cambodia at the end of the story and finally reunites with her long-lost family Loung's story is written in the first person present tense. *Chou - Chou's life in Cambodia was very different. The village where she and the rest of Loung's family lived was still plagued by random Khmer Rouge attacks. The family, despite its previous upper-class status, was reduced to peasant status. Khouy was forced to enlist in the military to earn money. At the age of eighteen Chou's aunt and uncle arrange a marriage to her. She and her new husband Pheng lived on her aunt and uncle's property. Chou gives birth to several children. Chou's story was recorded by Loung and translated to English.

Tsakonia () or the Tsakonian region () refers to the small area in the eastern Peloponnese where the Tsakonian language is spoken. It is not a formally defined political entity of the modern Greek state, being more akin to such vague regional constructions as \\"Dixie\\" in the United States or the \\"West Country\\" in England. Extent In his Brief Grammar of the Tsakonian Dialect published in 1951, Prof. Thanasis Costakis defines Tsakonia as the area from the town of Agios Andreas in Kynouria south to Leonidio and Tyros and inland as far as Kastanitsa and Sitaina, but asserts that in former times the Tsakonian-speaking area extended as far as Cape Malea in eastern Laconia. The principal town in Tsakonia at this time was Prastos, which benefited from a special trading privilege granted by the authorities in Constantinople. Prastos was burned by Ibrahim Pasha in the Greek War of Independence and was abandoned, with many of its residents fleeing to the area around Leonidio and Tyros or other spots on the Argolic Gulf. Some early commentators seem to have confused the speech of Maniot dialect speakers with true Tsakonian, demonstrating the flexible nature of the term. The actual Tsakonian speech community has shrunk greatly since Brief Grammar was published, but the area delineated by Costakis is still considered \\"Tsakonia\\" due to the preservation of certain cultural traits such as the Tsakonian dance and unique folk costumes. The Tsakonian speaking region was once much more widespread than it was at the time of Brief Grammar; Evliya Celebi noted in 1668 that the village of Vatika, far south of Leonidio, was Tsakonian; however that place would later be resettled by Arvanites; the Chronicle of Morea (14th century) furthermore indicates that Tsakonian was spoken in Cynuria, which is now part of Arcadia but was once considered to be in the northeast of Laconia. The original Tsakonian region may have consisted of the entire eastern half of Laconia. History Tsakonian: ŒìœÅŒøœçœÉœÉŒ± ŒΩŒ¨ŒºŒøœÖ ŒµŒØŒΩŒπ œÑŒ± Œ§œÉŒ±Œ∫œéŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ±.

What is often considered the first reference to Tsakonians is a note from around 950 by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his De Arte Imperiando, \\"the inhabitants of the district of Main... are of the older Greeks, who are to this day called Hellenes (pagans) by the locals for being pagans in time past and worshippers of idols, like the Hellenes of old, and were baptised and became Christians during the reign of the late Basil (867‚Äì886)\\", with Maina in his usage typically interpreted to instead mean TsakoniaOriginal from Porphyrogenitus: ·ºπœÉœÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ ·ΩÖœÑŒπ Œø·º± œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∫Œ¨œÉœÑœÅŒøœÖ œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒúŒ±ŒêŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒÆœÑŒøœÅŒµœÇ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ Œµ·º∞œÉ·Ω∂ŒΩ ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒµ·æ∂œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÅœÅŒ∑Œ∏Œ≠ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ¨Œ≤œâŒΩ, ·ºÄŒªŒª‚Äô ·ºêŒ∫ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœÑŒ≠œÅœâŒΩ ·ø¨œâŒºŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ, Œø·º≥ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ŒºŒ≠œáœÅŒπ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒΩ·ø¶ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩœÑŒøœÄŒØœâŒΩ ·ºùŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµŒØŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºêŒΩ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒø·øñœÇ œáœÅœåŒΩŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·º∞Œ¥œâŒªŒøŒªŒ¨œÑœÅŒ±œÇ Œµ·º∂ŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑œÑ·Ω∞œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œµ·º∞Œ¥œéŒªœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ºùŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ±œÇ, Œø·ºµœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºÄŒøŒπŒ¥ŒØŒºŒøœÖ ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒøœÖ Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒø·Ω∂ Œ≥ŒµŒ≥œåŒΩŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ The Tsakonians are thought to have been often border guards in the Byzantine military, judging by the number of references to œÑŒ∂Œ¨Œ∫œâŒΩŒµœÇ and œÑŒ∂Œ≠Œ∫œâŒΩŒµœÇ playing such roles in Byzantine Greek writings. The first reference to their \\"barbaric\\" speech being unintelligible to Koine Greek dates to the 15th century. According to the Byzantine historian George Pachymeres, some Tsakonians were resettled by the Byzantine emperor Michael VII Ducas in Propontis. This was part of their compensation for serving as marines in the Byzantine Navy. They and the Peloponnesian Gasmouloi, who served in the same role, were dismissed from service by Michael's successor, Andronicus II, who made large reductions in the naval force, preferring to rely on Genoese mercenaries. They lived in the villages of Vatka and Havoutsi, where the G√∂sen River (Aesepus) empties into the sea. However, based on the preservation of features common to both Propontis and the Peloponnesian dialects, Prof. Thanasis Costakis thinks that the date of settlement must have been several centuries later. Population The Tsakonians ( Ts√°kones) are a Greek ethnolinguistic group who historically speak the Tsakonian dialect and have certain peculiar cultural traditions, such as the Tsakonian dance. Today, the dialect is critically endangered. Tsakonians in later time were known for their masonry skills; many were also shepherds. A common practice was for a small crew of men under a mastora to leave their village after the feast of Saint Demetrius and to return at Easter. They would travel as far as Attica doing repairs and white-washing houses. The Tsakonian village of Kastanitsa was known for its chestnuts and derives its name from the Greek word for the nut.

Their motto \\"Virtus in periculis firmior\\" means Courage becomes stronger in danger. Until 24 December 1992, the division was called Reggimento Carabinieri Guardie della Repubblica (Carabinieri Guards of the Republic Regiment) and until 1990 it had been known as the Comando Carabinieri Guardie del Presidente della Repubblica (Carabinieri Guards of the President of the Republic Command). History =Origins= Armor of a Heavy Cuirassier of the 16th century. The first examples of a division of Archers and Esquires for the security of members of House of Savoy are dated back to the 15th century, but only during the dukedom of Emmanuel Philibert (1553-1580) a \\"Guard of Honor of the Prince\\" (Guardia d'Onore del Principe) was established with about fifty army-men led by a captain. This guard made its first appearance during the battle of St. Quentin in 1557. The division was subsequently expanded until in 1630 it had about 400 men, divided into 4 companies. Under the reign of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia (1675-1730), the security units and ceremonial guards were merged into the \\"Body Guards\\" (Guardie del Corpo), which was subdivided into four companies. Since then, few changes had been made to the uniforms or to the composition of the unit, which has performed normal operational functions as well as serving in war campaigns. During the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars and following the occupation of Piedmont, King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia left the Kingdom in 1798 with only a few guards and took refuge briefly in Sardinia and Spain, until his return to Rome where he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I on 4 June 1802. Thus, most of the Guards were transferred to the French government which formed the Squadron of Piedmontese Carabineers (Squadrone Carabinieri Piemontesi). Exiled for over a decade, Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia regain possession of his territories only on 20 May 1814, restoring the institutions existing before the Napoleonic rule. The corps of the Body Guards was re-established with the same dimension it originally had. On the following 13 July, the King established the \\"Corps of Royal Carabinieri\\" (Corpo dei Carabinieri Reali) with the occasional tasks of ‚Äúescorting royals‚Äù (initially belonging to the Body Guards), along with the law enforcement and public security purposes according to the Royal Licences (Patenti Reali). Reforms of Charles Albert of Sardinia (1834-1849) reduced the personnel and competences of Body Guards while giving a greater relevance to the Carabinieri, who were also designated to form a mounted squadron of honour for the wedding of the Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel II with the Archduchess Adelaide of Austria in 1842. The Body Guards took part to the First Italian War of Independence alongside the Carabinieri in order to protect the King. The Body Guards were formally dissolved in 1867, although during the previous twenty years only one company had continued to perform security services exclusively at the Royal Palace of Turin. They were absorbed by the Carabinieri, which were established as an Army Corps with the Royal Decree on the 24 of January 1861. =Kingdom of Italy= Uniform of a Cuirassier at the end of the 19th century. The Body of Cuirasses was established on 7 February 1868 in Florence (the Italian capital at the time). It was formed by carabinieri on horseback from the legions of Florence, Milan and Bologna. There were 80 carabinieri; each wearing a black helmet with crest and a black breastplate with a cross on the chest, white suede trousers and white gauntlets, high boots and silver spurs. The armour was wore above the Carabiniere uniform and epaulettes. The division was subsequently formed on the occasion of the wedding between Princess Margherita of Savoy and Prince Umberto I of Italy. Since then it had been never been disbanded. Members of the ‚ÄúCompany of His Highness‚Äôs Cuirasses‚Äù (Compagnia Corazze di Sua Altezza) used to wear the monogram of the King on their breastplates, which were similar to those previously worn by other units. Cuirasses Company had one commander captain, 4 officers, 9 deputy-officers and 69 carabinieri. In 1870, \\"Royal Guards Companies of the Palace\\" (Compagnie Guardie Reali del Palazzo) were dismantled and the \\"Carabinieri Guards of the King Squadron\\" (Squadrone Carabinieri Guardie del Re), also known as \\"Cuirassiers Squadron\\" (Squadrone Corazzieri), began the only division with the task to protect the Royal family. In 1871, following the transfer of the Kingdom capital from Florence to Rome, the Carabinieri Guards of the King Squadron joined the Carabinieri Legion of Rome and settled at the Quirinal Palace. Cuirassiers were deployed in the World War I in order to escort the King in military operations. Many Cuirassiers also joined the Italian resistance movement after the Badoglio Proclamation of 8 September 1943 and the escape of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, when they were left without orders. =Republic of Italy= On 13 June 1946, the last King, Umberto II of Italy, was exiled after the proclamation of the Republic and he freed the Cuirassiers from their oath to the Monarchy. The division was then renamed as the \\"3rd Mounted Carabineer Squadron\\" (3¬∞ Squadrone Carabinieri a Cavallo) and members wore new uniforms. The squadron returned to the Quirinal on 11 May 1948, when the second president of Italy Luigi Einaudi restored the \\"Squadron of Carabineer Guards\\" (Squadrone Carabinieri Guardie) with the historical uniforms of 1876. In 1961 the division was called \\"Squadrons Group\\" (Gruppo squadroni) and it was renamed \\"Carabineer Command of the Guards of the President of the Republic\\" (Comando Carabinieri Guardie del Presidente della Repubblica) in 1965. With the decree of the President of the Republic n. 671 of 12 September 1978, the Command obtained a banner for their mounted units. In 1990 the division was transformed into the \\"Carabineer Regiment of the Guards of the Republic\\" (Reggimento Carabinieri Guardie della Repubblica) and it was officially renamed in \\"Cuirassiers Regiment\\" (Reggimento Corazzieri) on 24 December 1992 with a decree of the 9th President of Italy Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. In February 2006, the Cuirassiers took part in the flag-raising ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. In June 2017, the first Cuirassier with black skin in the Italian history debuts during the visit of Pope Francis to the President Sergio Mattarella.  Members  = Recruitment requirements = Corazzieri on horseback in the gala uniform. The members of the Regiment, which are a specialized force of the Carabinieri, are distinguished by their uniforms and strict requirements needed to join the Regiment. A Cuirassier has to be at least 190 cm tall, with a \\"harmonious\\" body, a strong resistance and athletic preparation, important qualities for the long shifts during which he must stand with austere immobility in every condition. Moreover, candidates have to have an undisputed personal and familiar morality and it is necessary to have excellent disciplinary and service records, demonstrated by at least six months of territorial service and as many months of traineeship in the Regiment (with a final exam). Among the regiment there are snipers, martial artists, experts of personal defence and paratroopers. Cuirassiers must manage with expertise their vast range of equipment, known as \\"bottino\\" (\\"booty\\"), and they are trained to ride perfectly Irish Sport Horses and drive Moto Guzzi California cruisers, a means of complementary or alternative transport in daily services but also in many ceremonial services. Being in charge to escort the President of the Republic, Cuirassiers have to be able to manage promptly many delicate operations characterized by a large public presence and by the need to ensure a discreet, but always effective, protection. = Uniforms = Cuirassiers use the same uniforms which were established in 1878 but with some slight differences. Lance corporals and brigadiers wear single-breasted horse jackets while marshals and officers wear the double-breasted ones. In special circumstances, for example during guard shifts or ceremonies in the Quirinal, Cuirassiers wear mess dress uniforms, helmets with chinstraps and horse hair crests. During particular honour services, like the Italian Republic Day on 2 June, the distinctive cuirasses of the regiment are worn.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of the Regiment with the 1988 version of the seal of Carabinieri on the right side of the shield. The decree of the President of the Republic of 24 December 1986 had given a coat of arms for the Cuirassiers. It is a shield divided in two parts: on the left side, there are the colours representing the Italian capitals where the regiment had served (blue for Turin, silver for Florence and red for Rome) with a black eagle (symbol of the House of Savoy) above with the acronym \\"RI\\" (Repubblica Italiana), while on the right there is the coat of arms of the Arma dei Carabinieri. The shield is surmounted by a mural crown and it is sustained by two golden lions which bear the Italian Flag (left) and the Presidential standard (right). Lions stand on a banner reading the Latin motto ¬´VIRTUS IN PERICULIS FIRMIOR¬ª, which means \\"The courage becomes stronger than the peril\\". The current coat of arms has been changed twice, in 1990 and in 1992, accordingly to the changes made on the Presidential standard.

For the article on the lunar crater named for him, see Cleomedes (crater). Cleomedes () was a Greek astronomer who is known chiefly for his book On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies (ŒöœÖŒ∫ŒªŒπŒ∫·Ω¥ Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ± ŒºŒµœÑŒµœéœÅœâŒΩ), also known as The Heavens (). Placing his work chronologically His birth and death dates are not known‚Äîhistorians have suggested that he wrote his work sometime between the mid-1st century BCE and 400 CE. The earlier estimates rely on the fact that Cleomedes refers extensively in his writing to the work of mathematician and astronomer Posidonius of Rhodes (135 BC-51 BCE), and yet seemingly not at all to the work of Ptolemy (85-165 CE). (Cleomedes also refers to Aristotle (384-322 BCE), Pytheas of Massalia (325 BCE), Aratus (310-240 BCE), Eratosthenes (276-195 BCE), and Hipparchus (190-120 BCE).). These conclusions have been challenged on the grounds that Cleomedes' work was in relatively elementary astronomy, and that reference to Ptolemy would not necessarily be expected. The 20th century mathematician Otto Neugebauer, however, looked closely at the astronomical observations made by Cleomedes, and concluded that a date of 371 CE (¬±50 years) better explains what is found there. Neugebauer's estimate has been challenged on the grounds that Cleomedes makes observational errors with enough frequency that there is difficulty in deciding which observations to trust for the purpose of dating his work. On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies The book for which Cleomedes is known is a fairly basic astronomy textbook in two volumes. His purpose in writing seems to have been as philosophical as it was scientific‚Äîhe spends an extensive amount of time criticizing the scientific ideas of the Epicureans. Cleomedes' book is valued primarily for preserving, apparently verbatim, much of Posidonius' writings on astronomy (none of Posidonius' books have survived to the modern day). Cleomedes is accurate in some of his remarks on lunar eclipses, especially his conjecture that the shadow on the Moon suggests a spherical Earth. He also remarks presciently that the absolute size of many stars may exceed that of the Sun (and that the Earth might appear as a very small star, if viewed from the surface of the Sun). This book is the original source for the well-known story of how Eratosthenes measured the Earth's circumference. Many modern mathematicians and astronomers believe the description to be reasonable (and believe Eratosthenes' achievement to be one of the more impressive accomplishments of ancient astronomy). Cleomedes deserves credit for the earliest clear statement of the apparent distance explanation of the Sun Illusion or Moon Illusion. He argued that the sun appeared farther away on the horizon than in the zenith, and therefore larger (since its angular size was constant). He attributed this explanation to Posidonius. Optics As a disciple of Posidonius, Cleomedes noted some elementary qualitative properties of refraction, such as the bending of a ray toward the perpendicular in passing from a less dense to a more dense medium, and suggested that due to atmospheric refraction, the Sun and its rainbow may be visible when the Sun is below the horizon.Carl Benjamin Boyer, The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics (1959) Legacy Cleomedes is now memorialized by the crater Cleomedes in the northeastern portion of the visible Moon.

His broadcasting career began at KXYZ Houston in 1943. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, and in the Korean War, he was recalled to active duty as a reserve officer in the U.S. Air Force, where he helped establish radio stations in Newfoundland and Greenland for the Strategic Air Command. Afterward, he worked in New York City in TV and radio. He moved to Stockton, California in the mid-1950s, to host a children's program, Toonytown, on KOVR-TV, where he remained until 1958. He is widely remembered as \\"Mayor Art,\\" the host of a live children's show, featuring \\"Popeye\\" cartoons, that aired weekday afternoons on KRON-TV in San Francisco beginning in 1959 through 1966. Dressed in a top hat and a morning coat,Image of Mayor Art: he addressed his live audience of attendant children, who wore similar top hats, as the \\"city council.\\" Each program featured a short science segment; and in between Popeye cartoons, Finley used a hand puppet, \\"Ringading,\\" to teach introductory French, Spanish, German, and Italian words and phrases. The show's catchphrase, echoed by the City Council in every episode was \\"Bluey, Bluey\\" which may have related to Art's time in Greenland, where airfields are known as bluie. The traditional close to each show was \\"I'll be seeing you subsequently.\\". He would also introduce creative art and imagination when he would have one of the kids from the audience come up and haphazardly draw a shaped line on a blackboard. Mayor Art would then complete the line by continuing it into a cartoon or real world object. He was wonderfully gifted with many talents. \\"Mayor Art's Almanac\\" was the first TV newscast for children in the U.S., and the State of California awarded him two gold medals for the feature, in 1963 and 1965. The Mayor Art character was partly a way of introducing young people to civic matters, which, in retrospect, revealed Finley's true interests and foreshadowed his later career as a radio talk show host. When the Mayor Art Show ended in the summer of 1966, Finley joined KRON-TV's news department as a reporter and producer-host of \\"Speak Out,\\" a weekly political interview program, until 1968. During the last half of his 50-year career, Finley returned to radio as a newsman and talk-show host. He relied on his wife Geraldine as his career advisor, researcher and editor throughout their 56-year marriage. She died in 2006. In the U.S., Finley's station affiliations were primarily in San Francisco: 10 years at KGO, and KCBS. Three interim years were spent at XTRA in San Diego and WNIS in Norfolk. Two radio stations in Vancouver, B.C., needed a talk-show host with U.S. experience and a knowledge of Canadiana, and Finley spent five years at CKNW, and later, six years at CJOR. He retired in 1995; his final years in broadcasting were as a KCBS news anchor. While living in Canada, Finley contributed many news stories and features from that country and Europe, as byline writer for the San Francisco Chronicle Foreign Service. Art Finley served as Master of Ceremonies for San Francisco's official celebration of Independence Day for 14 years between 1960 and 1979. From 1962 to 1981, the San Francisco Chronicle and scores of other North American newspapers published his syndicated daily panel \\"Art's Gallery\\", consisting of 19th Century woodcuts, to which Finley had written humorous modern-day captions. All 6200+ original panels are now in the archives of San Francisco State University. On February 12, 2002, Finley donated tapes of 100 of his memorable radio interviews, to the University of British Columbia Library's Rare Books and Special Collections. Finley died of a heart attack on August 7, 2015.

The mountain rises to an elevation of above mean sea level and is the highest feature of the Laguna Volcanic Field. The volcano has no recorded historic eruption but volcanism is still evident through geothermal features like mud spring and hot springs. South of the mountain is the Makiling-Banahaw Geothermal Plant. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) classifies the volcano as \\"potentially active\\". Mount Makiling is a state-owned forest reserve administered by the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. Prior to its transfer to the university, the mountain was the first national park of the Philippines. Mount Makiling National Park was established on February 23, 1933 by Proclamation No. 552. However, it was decommissioned as a national park on June 20, 1963 by Republic Act no. 3523 when it was transferred to the University for use in forestry education and information. A Mount Makiling as seen from SM City Calamba The mountain is sacred to many pilgrims and is widely believed to be the home of an anito named Maria Makiling. It is one of the most known bundok dambanas in Calabarzon. It was declared as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2013, with the title of \\"Mount Makiling Forest Reserve\\". Legend Maria Makiling was the protector and guardian of Mount Makiling located in Los Ba√±os, Laguna. Thus, modern sightings of her were even reported. Maria Makiling is a common subject among Filipino artists, ranging from painters and sculptors to graphic novelists. Prior to the conversion of the natives to Christianity, Maria Makiling was already known as Makiling, an anito sent by Bathala in Mount Makiling to aid mankind in their daily tasks. The 'Maria' was added by the Spanish in a bid to 'rebrand' her as Catholic and to further subjugate the natives into Spanish imperialism. The contour of the mountain is said to be that of her in a reclining position. In some accounts, Maria Makiling, while serving as an anito of Bathala in Mount Makiling, was heartbroken by a mortal man, and thus chose to remain hidden from mortal view afterwards. History Mount Makiling viewed from SSW in Malvar, Batangas The following are the proclamations, Republic Acts, and Executive Orders relevant to the Makiling Forest Reserve (MFR): * Proclamation No. 106 (1910) ‚Äì Makiling Forest Reserve was established with specific boundaries and placed under the Bureau of Forestry by Governor General W. Cameron Forbes to regulate the use of public forest and forest reserves in the Philippines; Makiling Forest Reserve was set aside for the purpose of establishing a forest school and for silvicultural studies. * Proclamation No. 60 (1920) ‚Äì The reserved was renamed Makiling National Botanic Gardens and placed under the Bureau of Forestry by Proclamation NO. 60 issued by Governor General Francis B. Harrison primary for scientific studies on plants and animals. * Proclamation No. 552 (1933) ‚Äì The reserved was renamed the Makiling National Park under the Bureau of Forestry issued by Governor-General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. to serve as game refuge and for other purposes for the benefit and enjoyment of the people. * Proclamation No. 214 (1937) ‚Äì Calamba Estate block was added to the Park for forest purposes issued by President Manuel L. Quezon. * Republic Act (RA) 826 (1952) ‚Äì Transfer of the administration of the Makiling National Park form the Bureau of Forestry to the Commission of Parks and Wildlife in order to promote effectual planning, development, maintenance and conservation of all national parks, monuments and wildlife in the country. * Proclamation No. 692 (1960) ‚Äì Administration of the Makiling National Park was transferred from the Commission of Parks and Wildlife to the University of the Philippines (UP) issued by President Carlos P. Garcia for forestry education and research purposes of the College of Forestry, subject to the condition that said land will be conserved and preserved as a national park. * Republic Act (RA) 3523 (1963) ‚Äì The Makiling National park was disestablished and then ceded, transferred and conveyed to UP issued by Pres. Diosdado Macapagal to serve as the land resource for carrying out a program of public education and information in forestry, with end goal of promoting general public appreciation of forest values. * Executive Order (EO) 224 (1987) ‚Äì Complete jurisdiction, control and regulation of watershed areas including the Makiling Forest Reserve was given to the National Power Corporation (NPC) issued by President Corazon C. Aquino in support of the country's major program of energy development. * Republic Act (RA) 6967 (1990) ‚Äì Administration of the Makiling Forest Reserve was finally transferred to UPLB by President Corazon C. Aquino primarily as a training laboratory for the advancement of scientific and technical knowledge on the preservation, conservation and development of forest, flora and fauna and natural resources. * Executive Order 121 (1994) ‚Äì created a Presidential Commission on Laguna Lake and Mt.

Makiling is a popular hiking destination. The two major trails begin at the UPLB College of Forestry and Brgy. San Miguel, Santo Tomas. The UPLB trail is more commonly used, taking 4‚Äì5 hours to reach the summit (Peak 2). This trail was closed in October 2007 due to trail damage wrought by Typhoon Xangsane on September 2006. The trail was closed again in December 2012 after two students were found drowned in a restricted area on the mountain. The trail was re-opened most recently in March 2013. The second trail, known as Maktrav, starts in Santo Tomas. This route is more difficult and requires 6‚Äì7 hours to reach the summit. Both trails are generally established and safe, although throughout the years there have been occasional reports of fatal accidents and injuries, especially on the Santo Tomas side. Climbers also frequently encounter leeches along the way.

It was also a former independent service branches of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The former Republican Guard and the current Special Forces of the SGO is designed for protection and defense of residence of the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev in Almaty and Nur-Sultan.  History  The Republican Guard was established on March 16, 1992, when the President of Kazakhstan signed a decree on their creation. Thus, the Day of the Republican Guard has been set as March 16. The Republican Guard was established on the basis of a separate brigade of operational designation of the Kazakh Internal Troops deployed in the village of Ak Zhar (located in the Kaskelen District of the Almaty Region). From the very beginning of its inception, it faced many difficulties such as a lack of resources and equipment as well as problems with the professional education of the troops.https://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/1124 In August 1992, at the CSKA stadium in Almaty, President Nursultan Nazarbayev was first introduced to the Republican Guard in the person of a manned battalion of government protection, an honor guard and a military band. On December 16, 1992, Republican Guard conscripts were the first to be sworn in a ceremony at the Park of 28 Panfilov Guardsmen. Two weeks later, on the day before New Year's Eve, the Republican Guard accepted the role of round-the-clock personal security at the Almaty Presidential Residence, which was then under construction. On February 22, 1993, the standards of the State Flag and the State Emblem of Kazakhstan at the in the Palace of the Republic were given 24-hour protection by the guard. That spring, designer Serik Suleimenov developed a uniform for servicemen of the honor guard company, for officers the introduction of a special full dress uniform (a white tunic) was provided. In October 1995, the Republican Guard was introduced into the Presidential Security Service, only to later be transferred to a separate department. In March 1997, in honor of the 5th anniversary of the formation of the guard, the Battle Banner was presented by President Nazarbayev. In October 1997, the office of the commander of the guard was relocated to the new capital of Astana. On April 21, 2014, Republican Guard and the Presidential Security Service were merged to form the State Security Service of Kazakhstan. In May 2017, the use of the term Republican Guard was abolished by a authorities.

A cavalry squadron was maintained in the mid-90s. The cavalry squadron was formed in May 1996 to participate in protocol events and processions. A month later, on the basis of military unit 0115 in the village of Chemolgan, training was held with servicemen with experience working with horses or cavalry training. Equestrian training began on the Panfilovsky breeding farm, with horses being selected with a height of 165-168 centimeters Boris Bardinhttps://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01007267803, a specialist from the equestrian training department of the Institute of Border Troops, assisted greatly in preparing the squadron. The cavalry squadron first took part in the military parade on December 16, 1996 in Almaty, dedicated to the 5th anniversary of independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In connection with the transfer of the capital to the city of Akmola, at the end of 1996 the cavalry squadron was disbanded.https://works.doklad.ru/view/wIxZet-3lIU/all.html In July 1997, servicemen from the ceremonial battalion and the Presidential Band visited Malaysia at the invitation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Within one week, the guard of honor company and the Presidential Band performed demonstrations and concerts. In October 1997, the ceremonial battalion was relocated to the new capital and housed in the Orbita microdistrict on the territory of a former kindergarten. It would eventually become the Aibyn Presidential Regiment in 2014.

He lived at the Tower of Sark, close to the border between Scotland and England, north of the centre of the border line. The tower was built for his father Sandy Armstrong, and although now demolished the site is marked by a monument unveiled in 1996.Valentina Bold, his grave is in the cemetery opposite the modern dark tower farm.The Kinmont Willie Sword and other Tales of Mettle (Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, November 2018), p. 11-13. The Raid on Carlisle and the Ballad Perhaps the best known of the Border reivers (outlaw raiders or rustlers), William Armstrong of Kinmont's first recorded raid was against the Milburns of Tynedale in August 1583, when Armstrong was probably in his forties. In 1585 he accompanied the Earl of Angus\`s campaign against the Earl of Arran and pillaged Stirling. Eight years later he was in Tynedale again with 1,000 men, carrying off over 2,000 beasts and ¬£300 in spoils. Armstrong was captured in violation of a border truce day in 1596. At a Truce Day all who attended to witness the criminal trials were granted 'safe conduct' for the Day and until the following sunrise. Kinmont was arrested by the deputies of the English warden Lord Scrope and imprisoned in Carlisle Castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 244. The Scottish warden of the West March Walter Scott of Buccleuch, Keeper of Liddesdale, protested to Lord Scrope. When Scrope refused to release Armstrong, Buccleuch led a party of men on a daring raid into England and broke Armstrong out of the castle with inside help from the English Grahams and Carletons. Elizabeth I of England was furious that one of her Border fortresses had been broken into at a time when peace existed between England and Scotland. Her relationship with James VI of Scotland was tested. Elizabeth demanded that Buccleuch should appear in her court in person. James VI was caught between allegiance to the Scots who were adamant Buccleuch had done no wrong in rescuing a man who was captured illegally and his desire to pander to his English benefactor, Elizabeth. Buccleuch eventually freely rode from King James to Queen Elizabeth. After their audience, Queen Elizabeth said: \\"With ten thousand such men, our brother in Scotland might shake the firmest throne of Europe.\\" A contemporary Scottish narrative written around 1603, after the death of Elizabeth, gives more details on Armstrong, Buccleuch, and the raid on Carlisle Castle. Armstrong was riding home in Liddesdale when he was pursued by 200 followers of the English deputy, Thomas Salkeld. He was captured after a chase of four miles and taken to Carlisle. The Laird of Buccleuch complained to the deputy and the warden Lord Scrope, and also asked Sir Robert Bowes to write to Scrope. Buccleuch received no reply and interpreted this as an insult to James VI. He sent men to Carlisle to examine a postern gate and the height of the walls. A woman went into the castle as a visitor to identify where Armstrong was held. He mustered 200 men at the Tower of Morton (Sark Tower) on the River Sark with scaling ladders and siege tools. They reached Stanwix Bank to cross the River Eden two hours before dawn. The ladders were too short so his men broke through the wall near the postern gate. They fought with the watchmen and sentinels while Scrope and Salkeld and their men held back, and then withdrew with Armstrong and some other prisoners. According to this narrative, Buccleuch returned the other prisoners and looted goods, and only the gate and prison door were damaged.Annie I. Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (SHS: Edinburgh, 1932), pp. 285, 292-299 scanned by National Library of Scotland. In 1600, Armstrong attacked the village of Scotby with 140 riders, burning and taking prisoners and cattle. In 1602 he rode his last foray, south of Carlisle. He was still alive two years later, and his four sons who had helped to get him out of Carlisle Castle are frequently named in the later Border raids. Legend supposes he died in his bed of old age, sometime between 1608 and 1611. The story of the raid on Carlisle Castle is told in the ballad \\"Kinmont Willie\\" (Child No. 186). The Sword and the Story A sword in the collection of the Annan Museum collection has an old label identifying it as Kinmont Willie's sword.

D. Kuskova. Yekaterina Dmitriyevna Kuskova (1869‚Äì1958) was a Russian economist, journalist and politician involved in founding both the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) and the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party. She was an advocate of social reformism and opposed the Bolsheviks. Populism, Marxism and Revisionism Kuskova was born in Ufa, in the Ufa Governorate of the Russian Empire. Her father was a school teacher. As a child, she moved to Samara and then to Saratov. In the 1880s, she became involved in the revolutionary movement. In 1890, she went to study in Moscow and participated in clandestine Narodnik circles. She was affiliated with the party of the 'People's Right' of Mark Natanson and met the future Socialist- Revolutionary leader Viktor Chernov. She was arrested in 1893 and exiled to Nizhni Novgorod (Gorki). Then, she converted to Marxism and joined a group of Social-Democratic exiles that included her future husband, Sergei Prokopovich, whom she married in 1895. After being released, the couple moving to Germany in 1897. There, they met George Plekhanov and became active in the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. In 1898 they became members of the newly created RSDRP. However, by the late 1890s, Kuskova and Prokopovich had become increasingly doubtful about orthodox Marxism. Kuskova, in particular, became a proponent of Eduard Bernstein's Revisionism, which she championed in her famous and highly controversial 1899 article Credo. Kuskova believed that the orthodox Marxist theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism was wrong, that the development of capitalism in Russia was beneficial, and that capitalism could develop into socialism by means of gradual reform. These views were labeled 'Economism' by her critics (a somewhat vague term the orthodox Marxists applied to a number of different heresies, from revolutionary syndicalism to revisionism). These critics included George Plekhanov, Pavel Axelrod, V.I. Lenin and many others. In the course of the controversy, Kuskova was expelled from the RSDRP. Her husband left the party as well. The Economism controversy also attracted attention from Western European socialists and became part of the larger battle between reformists and revolutionaries that raged in the late nineteenth century. Liberalism, Reformism and the Russian Revolutions E.D. Kuskova In 1904, Kuskova and Prokopovich became founding members of the liberal Union of Liberation, subsequently renamed the Constitutional-Democratic Party (KDP). The party demanded democratic political reforms and modest social reforms to benefit the working class. It united a number of former Marxists, notably P.B. Struve (who had written the RSDRP's first programme), and the philosophers N.A. Berdyaev and S.L. Frank, with a number of former Narodniks, such as A.V. Peshekhonov, N.F. Annensky and V.A. Myakotin, and with national liberals like P.N. Miliukov who had no socialist background at all. For some time, the ex-Marxists in the KDP maintained contact with the German Social-Democrats and insisted that they were still socialists, but that Russia was not ripe for socialism and must first have a capitalist democracy. Kuskova was one of the founders and editors of the journal Nasha Zhizn (Our Life), which became the official organ of the KDP. She became associated with Father Gapon, an Orthodox priest and social reformer who led the unarmed demonstration on Bloody Sunday, January 9, 1905 (OS), that sparked the Revolution of 1905. Because of her association with Gapon, Kuskova was briefly arrested. Upon her release, she helped organise the Union of Unions, one of the principal foci of liberal opposition to the r√©gime. She was briefly a member of the Central Committee of the KDP, but soon resigned and left the KDP, because she disagreed with the conservative direction of its leader, Miliukov. In the 1910s Kuskova devoted herself to journalism, founding, editing and contributing to several journals, such as Tovarich (Comrade) and Bez Zaglaviia (Without Title), which was closed down by the authorities. She contributed to Russkie Vedomosti (The Russian Gazette) as well. She advocated a reformist socialism, to the left of the KDP but incompatible with the Marxist orthodoxy of the RSDRP. Although she never attempted to rejoin the RSDRP, she maintained friendly relations with some of the Mensheviks, particularly the so-called 'Liquidators' who, in the 1910s, wanted to dissolve the illegal underground apparatus of the RSDRP and concentrate on legal work in trade unions and co-operatives. (Unions had been legalised in 1906.) Before the war Kuskova was involved in the co-operative movement, in Freemasonry and in the struggle for women's rights. She was an early advocate of feminism in Russia. She was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples. In 1914, Kuskova adopted a Defencist position. In 1917 she welcomed the February Revolution and supported the Provisional Government, which her husband at joined as Minister of Trade and Energy and then as Minister of Food. Kuskova launched the democratic socialist journal Vlasti Naroda (The People's Power), which united Defencist socialists from a variety of parties, including right- wing Mensheviks like Aleksandr Potresov, veteran Narodniks like Nikolai Tchaikovsky and right wing SRs like Boris Savinkov. She was fiercely critical of the Bolsheviks' anti-war agitation but also condemned the Constitutional Democrats for their involvement in the Kornilov Affair. She participated in the Democratic Conference and the Pre-Parliament, and she stood as a candidate for election to the Constituent Assembly. She opposed the Bolsheviks' October Revolution and denounced the Bolsheviks' suppression of the Constituent Assembly, but she did not support armed counter-revolution. She remained in Russia throughout the Civil War. In 1921, at the height of the famine that followed the civil war, Kuskova, Prokopovich and some of their old associates volunteered for the Public Committee for Famine Relief. Their efforts were tolerated as long as the situation was dire, but the Soviet government eventually accused the Committee of engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda. In November 1921 they were arrested and exiled to Vologda. In 1922, Kuskova and her husband were expelled from Soviet Russia, along with a number of other prominent liberals and social reformists. Final Exile Kuskova and Prokopovich first settled in Berlin, where they were active in various organisations supporting Russian political prisoners and published a number of anti-Bolshevik journals. In 1924 they moved to Prague, where Kuskova participated in forming the 'Republican Democratic Association' with a number of exiled liberals. During the NEP Kuskova had hopes that the Soviet Union would reform itself and that she might one day be able to return, but these hopes were sharply criticised by old allies like Struve. In 1939, when Hitler invaded Prague, the couple moved to Geneva. Kuskova continued to write on economics, history and political matters. During the Second World War she again hoped that, once fascism was defeated, the Soviet Union, allied with the West, would permit democratic exiles to return. Again she was disappointed. She died in Geneva on December 22, 1958. Sources * Shukman, H. (ed.), The Blackwell Encyclopedia of the Russian Revolution. Oxford: Blackwell, 1988. * The Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Moscow, 1979.

According to an article in The New York Times, Whittlesey was modeled after a female unit manager whom series creator Tom Fontana met at a prison in southern New Jersey. Character overview Oz's first female correctional officer is a divorcee and single mother, who has suffered spousal abuse, poverty and substance abuse; through all of that, she gained a pretty good understanding of criminal life. She is a CO in the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary, but repeatedly explains that this is because she can't find work anywhere else. Her only drive is taking care of her mother, who has cancer, and her young daughter, whom she has to raise all by herself. She works double shifts, sometimes sleeping in the prison, just to make ends meet, and is shown to be one of the more compassionate and fair COs. Whittlesey is one of the few characters to have a happy ending to their series arc. Season 1 (1997) Whittlesey is introduced as the supervisor of the guards in Emerald City, Unit Manager Tim McManus' experimental cell block, first seen when a new group of inmates, including Tobias Beecher and Miguel Alvarez, arrive at Oz. She helps to keep prisoners' records and to stop any conflicts between inmates. Eventually, she and McManus form an attraction and even have sex inside an empty cell while avoiding the execution of Jefferson Keane. However, when the two receive flak from their fellow staff members over their relationship, particularly by Mike Healy, she breaks it off with McManus, who despite his reputation for bed-hopping and womanizing reacts poorly. Eventually, Whittlesey gets some bad news ‚Äî Oz has made a contract with the Department of Corrections that, as a condition, will no longer allow officers to work overtime, severely impacting her finances. More trouble arises for her when Scott Ross enters Oz. He was a biker on the outside and used to be in the same gang as Whittlesey's ex-husband. He is obsessed with Whittlesey, and on the outside he repeatedly tried to have sex with her behind her husband's back. Ross decides to \\"help her out\\" with her situation at home; he proposes that she smuggle cigarettes for him and he will give her a cut of the profits. She agrees reluctantly, but is quickly discovered by McManus. He doesn't fire her, knowing she's only trying to make money for her family, but demands she put an end to it. Ross however, threatens to tell Warden Leo Glynn and take from Whittlesey everything she has worked for unless she continues. When a riot breaks out in Em City, Whittlesey is protected from serious harm or rape by Kareem Said and the Muslims, but ultimately taken hostage along with several other COs. When Miguel Alvarez attempts to patch up two severely injured guards, Whittlesey reveals she used to be a volunteer nurse and offers assistance, which is ignored. When the SORT team prepares to storm Em City, Whittlesey is lined up with McManus (who traded himself as a hostage for the two critically injured officers) and the other COs with the expectation they will be the first to get shot and killed. In the ensuing chaos Ross shoots McManus with Said's discarded handgun. Whittlesey later procures a gun and kills Ross, shooting him in the head, heart, and genitalia. Season 2 (1998) As Alvah Case investigates the riot, he notices that Ross was shot execution style. Meanwhile, while patrolling Unit B, Vern Schillinger, leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, tells Whittlesey that he saw her kill Ross and that he will make sure she is exposed. When Case confronts Whittlesey, she admits to killing Ross. Glynn convinces Case that Whittlesey is the best guard he's ever had, that she is struggling to make enough money, and that punishing her for taking Ross' life is not worth ruining hers. Feeling sorry for Whittlesey, Case rules that Ross was killed by bullets from the SORT team members. Schillinger proposes to Whittlesey that if she helps him kill Tobias Beecher, he will pay her handsomely and keep her secret. She turns the tables against him, however, and sets him up to be charged with conspiracy to commit murder. To get back at her, Schillinger tells McManus the truth about Ross' death. Whittlesey denies it to McManus. Eventually, Whittlesey decides to move back to Emerald City, where she shows an unrequited interest in McManus. He now suspects her of killing Ross, and reopens the investigation. She admits to him that she did do it, but only because Ross shot him first. Schillinger approached Muslim leader Kareem Said, who was handling cases for various prisoners, and asked him to represent him on the conspiracy to commit murder charge. In investigating the case, Said interrogated McManus and Whittlesey about the murder, and both of them lied. Eventually, the lack of proof buried the truth once more. However, McManus was ridden with guilt for lying, and decided to transfer Whittlesey out of Emerald City and into Unit B. Season 3 (1999) Whittlesey continues to work in Unit B, and finds another female correctional officer working with her, Officer Claire Howell. Tension soon develops between them, once Howell takes an interest in McManus. Soon afterward, Whittlesey learns that her mother has died. McManus comforts her, which stirs up tension in his relationship with Howell. Eventually, Howell sues him for sexual harassment, worsening the tension between the two women. Whittlesey takes McManus' side, and the two grow close again throughout the ordeal. In the end, McManus asks Whittlesey to renew their relationship. When the entire prison is put into lockdown amid serious racial tension, Whittlesey fears another riot, and decides to take vacation leave. She goes to England with her daughter. Season 4 (2000) Whittlesey's vacation was supposed to be finished, but she never came back to Oz, much to McManus' disappointment and agitation, since he intended to propose to her upon her return. She phones Sister Pete, and explains that she is engaged to a Royal Guardsman. McManus is crushed, and barely acknowledges her during a strained long-distance phone call. This leads to McManus having a nervous breakdown, and eventually, losing his job. Whittlesey's departure was written into the show as Edie Falco had been offered the role of Carmela Soprano on The Sopranos. =Murders committed= * Scott Ross - Shot in the head, heart, and genitalia by Whittlesey for shooting Tim McManus after the riot in Emerald City.

He was the first democratically elected president of the Maldives and one of the founders of the Maldivian Democratic Party. In the 2008 presidential election, he was elected as the candidate of the first opposition coalition defeating President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had ruled the Maldives as president for 30 continuous years. Nasheed assumed office on 11 November 2008. On 7 February 2012, Nasheed resigned as president under disputed circumstances, following weeks of protests by the opposition, which had then been joined by a majority of military and police forces. The next day, he stated that he had been forced to resign \\"at gunpoint\\" by police and army officers, and that the protesters had joined with \\"powerful networks\\" of Gayoom loyalists to force his resignation in a coup d'√©tat. His successor, Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who had been a 2003 political appointee of Gayoom, denied these claims and stated that the transfer of power was voluntary and constitutional. The Maldives' Commission of National Inquiry reported that it had found no evidence to support Nasheed's version of events. In March 2015, Nasheed was convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act of Maldives for arresting Criminal Court Judge Abdulla Mohamed while president, and sentenced to 13 years at Maafushi Prison. Amnesty International has described the conviction as \\"politically motivated\\", and the United States Department of State expressed concern at \\"apparent lack of appropriate criminal procedures during the trial\\". In 2016, he was given asylum in the United Kingdom, where he had gone for medical treatment. On June 29, 2018, he renounced his plans to contest the country's presidential elections, citing legal obstacles. He said the Election Commission's decision to reject his victory in a party primary poll was illegal and demanded that the authority be sanctioned. After his party's candidate, Ibrahim Solih, won presidential elections in 2018, Nasheed returned to the Maldives, where he led the MDP to a landslide victories in parliamentary elections the following year, subsequently taking office as Speaker of parliament. Early life Nasheed takes refuge at the Indian Embassy Nasheed was born in Mal√©, Maldives, to a middle-class family. He attended Majeediyya School in Maldives between 1971 and 1981. He continued his secondary school education at Overseas School of Colombo in Sri Lanka from 1981 to 1982 until he completed his GCE O Levels. In August 1982 he moved to England, where he completed his higher secondary education at Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire. Straight after his GCE A Levels, Nasheed moved north to Liverpool, where he spent the next three years reading in maritime studies at Liverpool Polytechnic (later Liverpool John Moores University), graduating in 1989. Nasheed was held in prison for an article in the political magazine Sangu, published in 1991, alleging the government had rigged the 1989 General election. He was named an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience in 1991. He has stated that he was tortured while in detention, including being chained to a chair outside for 12 days and forced to eat food containing crushed glass. He was later alleged by the government, to have withheld information about a bombing plot. On 8 April 1992, he was sentenced to three years in prison on that charge. He was released in June 1993, then re-arrested in 1994 and 1995. In 1996 he was sentenced to two years imprisonment for an article he had written about the 1993 and 1994 Maldivian elections, and was again designated a prisoner of conscience. In all, he was arrested more than twenty times during Gayoom's rule, missing the births of both of his daughters. During his time in jail, he spent significant amounts of time studying, producing three books on Maldivian history. Parliament In 1999, he was elected as a Member of Parliament representing Mal√©. However, he was forced to leave office on a theft charge that the BBC and other international media sources described as politically motivated. Maafushi Prison In September 2003 Nasheed requested that a doctor view the body of Hassan Evan Naseem, a 19-year-old prisoner who had died in Maafushi Jail while serving a term for drug possession. The subsequent investigation revealed that Naseem had been tortured to death. This revelation, and the violent suppression of the prison riot that followed, sparked the anti-government protests of the 2003 Maldives civil unrest, leading to the first State of Emergency in Maldivian history and a \\"turning point\\" in its history. In November 2003 Nasheed left the Maldives and joined Mohamed Latheef to help establish the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), in self-exile, in Sri Lanka and the UK. He was recognised as a political refugee by the British government in 2004. After about 18 months, Nasheed returned to Mal√© on 30 April 2005. After returning to the Maldives, he began promoting the MDP before it was officially recognised by the Government. With 2 June 2005 decision to allow political parties and official recognition of the MDP, Nasheed accelerated his support campaigns for the party. He made several trips to the atolls and neighbouring countries on behalf of the party. On 12 August 2005 Nasheed was arrested again when he was sitting in the center of the Republican Square, with supporters of MDP, to mark the second anniversary of Black Friday. His arrest provoked civil unrest in Mal√© and some other atolls. After his arrest, acting Government Spokesman Mohamed Hussain Shareef told reporters that Nasheed had been detained for \\"his own safety.\\" However, on 22 August 2005, the state announced that Nasheed was to be charged with terrorism under the Terrorism Act. Presidency =2008 presidential election= In the 2008 presidential campaign, Nasheed ran for the post of president on an MDP ticket, with Mohammed Waheed Hassan from Gaumee Itthihaad as the vice presidential candidate; this was the first time the country had held a multiparty presidential election by popular vote. In the first round, Nasheed and Waheed placed second with 44,293 votes (24.91%), behind President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the governing Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP), who received 71,731 votes (40.34%). In the second round of elections, Nasheed and Waheed were backed by the unsuccessful first round candidates (Watan Edey Coalition), made up of Dr. Hassan Saeed (Gaumee Itthihaad), Gasim Ibrahim (Jumhoory Party), Sheih Hussain Rasheed (Adhaalath Party, Islamic Party), Ibrahim Ismail (Social Democratic Party), and Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik (Gaumee Itthihaad). Nasheed and Waheed won 54.25% of the vote against 45.75% for Gayoom. Following the election, Nasheed and Waheed were sworn in as the President and Vice President of the Maldives on 11 November 2008, in a special session of the People's Majlis at Dharubaaruge. =Cabinet= President Nasheed's first cabinet included 14 ministers. The posts were handed to politicians from the coalition with respect to the contribution to the \\"Watan Edhey\\" Coalition. As per the coalition agreement, President Nasheed created the first ever Islamic Ministry in the Maldives, with a cabinet post representing it. Within four months after his first cabinet was formed, President of Jumhoory Party, Qasim Ibrahim resigned as Home Minister. This was followed by the President of Gaumee Party, Hassan Saeed, Civil Aviation Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed, and Attorney General Fathimath Dhiyana Saeed. The next appointment for the Attorney General, Husnu Suood, also resigned, followed by Finance Minister Ahmed Inaz. Later the remaining main party in the Coalition, Adhaalath Party (Islamic Party) cut ties with the ruling MDP, citing religious matters. By the end of the first year of his presidency, President Nasheed's cabinet contained only ministers from the ruling party. =Policies= Nasheed at the launch of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor With regard to the threat posed to the very low- lying islands by changes in sea level caused by global warming, in March 2009 Nasheed pledged to set an example by making the Maldives carbon-neutral within a decade by moving to wind and solar power. He argued that the cost of the change would be no higher than what the Maldives already spends on energy. As part of a wider campaign by international environmental NGO 350.org's campaign publicising the threats of climate change and its effects on the Maldives, Nasheed presided over the world's first underwater cabinet meeting on 17 October 2009, off the island of Girifushi with the meeting participants underwater in scuba diving gear. The following month, Nasheed founded the Climate Vulnerable Forum, an association of countries affected disproportionately by climate change. =June 2010 crisis= On 29 June 2010, Nasheed's 12 cabinet ministers resigned en masse, protesting the behaviour of opposition MPs who they said were \\"hijacking\\" the powers of the executive and making it impossible for the cabinet Ministers to discharge their constitutional duties and deliver the government's election manifesto. The ministers called on the President to investigate why certain MPs were blocking the government's work, citing allegations of corruption and bribery in parliament. On 7 July, Nasheed reappointed all twelve Ministers of the Cabinet, at a ceremony held at the President's Office in Mal√©. Speaking at a press conference held shortly after presenting the Ministers with their letters of appointment, Nasheed said his government would \\"work towards fulfilling its pledges to the people.\\" Nasheed noted that the government had investigated the reasons why cabinet members felt they had to resign and the police had taken appropriate action. The President reiterated that only a small number of MPs are implicated in alleged corruption, saying that \\"the reputation of the People's Majlis should not be tarnished because of corruption allegations against a few parliamentarians.\\" After the re- installation of the cabinet on 7 July, the cabinet was sent to the parliament for endorsement. On 22 November, the parliament voted and declared that only five out of the 12 appointees would be accepted. They also called for the rejected ministers to step down immediately. This resulted in heated arguments between ruling party MDP and opposing DRP, who holds majority seats in parliament. The parliament ruled that the rejected appointees would not be considered as ministers, and refused to allow Finance minister Ali Hashim to present the 2011 state budget for parliament approval. Members of MDP responded to this by declaring that neither parliament or supreme court had rights to dismiss ministers and threatened high members of the parliament. On 10 December 2010, the Supreme Court of Maldives ruled that the ministers not endorsed by the parliament cannot remain in their posts, and requested their immediate resignation from office. Three days later, Nasheed appointed two new ministers and acting ministers for four more offices. He also reappointed the rejected Attorney General, Dr. Sawad. =Resignation= Less than a year into the presidency, cabinet members representing other political parties in the coalition began to resign in protest of an alleged lack of respect for transparency and the constitution. The last major party to sever its ties to the ruling party was the Adhaalath Party. Another issue taken up by the opposition parties was that Nasheed's government allowed spas and resort islands to be exempt from the laws that prohibited alcohol and pork products elsewhere in the largely Muslim nation. Protests became a frequent occurrence in the streets of the capital city of Mal√© after the president's coalition slowly dissolved. President Nasheed's own Finance Minister Ahmed Inaz was assaulted by President Nasheed's party activist after meeting an opposition leader, current President Yameen Abdul Gayoom. An opposition alliance (Madhanee Ithihaad) was formed in December 2011, including all the parties that supported the president in his 2008 presidential race. Those parties included the Gaumee Party, Jumhoory Party, and Adhaalath Party. On 23 December, the capital city saw major opposition protests against Nasheed and his government. Former cabinet minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed was repeatedly summoned to the police station in connection with the protests, at one point being detained at Dhoonidhoo, a Maldivian prison island. Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed ordered his release, but according to the police his non-compliance with their on-going investigations against him led in turn to his being arrested by members of the Maldives National Defence Force. Due to the arrest of the judge, the opposition parties' protests gained momentum and demanded Judge Abdulla Mohamed's immediate release. During the detention of the judge, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives (HRCM) was able to visit him in his place of detention, a military training base, and confirm his safety. Opposition leaders also called for an independent investigation into the constitutionality of the arrest, a call echoed by the HRCM, the Judicial Services Commission, the Prosecutor General's Office, the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. Military and police rejected the orders by the High Court to release Abdulla Mohamed. The opposition's protest in the Republic Square lasted for 22 consecutive days. On 6 February 2012, the Maldives Police Service declined to use force to control or disperse the protests and joined the protest. In the early hours of 7 February 2012, President Nasheed was seen inside the military headquarters. The Maldives National Defence Force subsequently had a standoff with police who had joined the protesters, in which the MDF fired rubber bullets into the crowd. (The President's office, however, denied these reports.) Military forces increasingly joined the opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: \\"I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, the people of the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives. I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established. My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people. And I thank you all for your support and contributions to achieve success for the past three years.\\" He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who claims to have opposed Abdulla Mohamed's arrest, was then sworn in as the new president, and a warrant was issued for Nasheed's arrest. Nasheed later wrote that he was forced to resign \\"at gunpoint\\", and that \\"powerful networks\\" of Gayoom loyalists had manipulated events to \\"strangle\\" Maldivian democracy. The coup interpretation was also backed by UK MP David Amess, Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group to the Maldives, but contradicted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who asserted that Nasheed \\"had resigned\\". Nasheed's successor and opposition forces also stated that the transfer of power was voluntary. A later British Commonwealth meeting concluded that it could not \\"determine conclusively the constitutionality of the resignation of President Nasheed\\", but called for an international investigation. The Maldives' Commission of National Inquiry, appointed to investigate the matter, found that there was no evidence to support Nasheed's version of events. The U.S. State Department and the Commonwealth of Nations Secretary Kamalesh Sharma welcomed the release of the report, and called on Maldivians to abide by its decision. Chief of the Defense Force Moosa Ali Jaleel, however, said the circumstances leading up to the resignation of the former president gave rise to the fact that resignation was obtained by \\"illegal coercion\\". \\"I fully believe that President [Nasheed] resigned under duress,\\" he said. According to former military intelligence head Ahmed Nilam, \\"Academically speaking, the events on February 7 fulfilled all the essentials of a coup. It involved all the features of a coup that are widely accepted around the world.\\" On 8 February, the MDP convened an emergency executive meeting and called for its members to go into streets. President Nasheed then attempted to lead the protesters to the Republic Square. Before his march reached the square, however, the Maldives Police Service dispersed the protest with batons and pepper spray. An Amnesty International spokesperson later condemned the police tactics as \\"brutal\\" and \\"outright human rights violations\\". Post-presidency In the weeks following Nasheed's resignation, he requested that the Commonwealth of Nations threaten the Maldives with expulsion unless new elections are held. The Commonwealth supported Nasheed's call for early elections, calling on both Nasheed and Waheed to enter talks to arrange new polls before the year's end. A documentary about Nasheed's efforts to halt climate change, The Island President, was filmed throughout 2009 and 2010. It was directed by Jon Shenk, produced by Actual Films, and features a soundtrack with songs by Radiohead. The film won the Cadillac People's Choice Documentary Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and opened in New York City on 28 March 2012. The New York Times describes the film as \\"unabashedly pro-Nasheed\\" and \\"the biggest media event Mr. Nasheed could have hoped for\\" to publicize his cause. The film proved popular in the Maldives, with scalpers reportedly selling tickets at twice their value. The Island President received generally positive reviews from U.S. critics, holding a 98% \\"Fresh\\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 72 out of 100 at Metacritic. On 1 April 2012, Nasheed stated that he was unsure of the official charges against him in the Maldives: \\"One time they said it was terrorism, another time they said it was acting against the constitution, another time they said it was alcohol.\\" In September, he was put on trial for abuse of power for his actions in arresting Abdulla Mohamed; however, his trial was cancelled without explanation. Nasheed was again arrested in October for violating a court order not to leave Mal√© Atoll, the atoll on which the Maldivian capital is located. He was detained overnight and then released on the condition that he would answer questions about his alleged abuse of presidential powers within 25 days. Nasheed was reported to have taken refuge in the Indian High Commission office in Mal√© in February 2013 after a Maldivian court issued an arrest warrant against him and ordered the police to detain him.Maldives ex-president Mohamed Nasheed seeks refuge in Indian embassy, NDTV, 13 February 2013, accessed on 13 February 2013.Maldives issues arrest warrant against former mission prez Mohamed Nasheed, The Economic Times, 13 February 2013, accessed on 13 February 2013. In March 2013, he was arrested on the charges of abuse of the office but was released a day later. Numerous stops and starts to his trial followed. In February 2015, Nasheed was arrested again and ordered to stand on trial for his decision to arrest Abdulla Mohamed in 2012 while he was the president. On 13 March 2015, Nasheed was sentenced to thirteen years in Maafushi Prison for abducting Abdulla Mohamed. He was charged under the Anti- Terrorism Act of Maldives. The three-judge bench unanimously found him guilty of ordering the arrest of Abdulla Mohamed in January 2012, when he held the office of the president. The ruling came four days after Nasheed's lawyers quit in protest against what they called was a biased trial aimed at destroying his political career. He was originally cleared of the charge, but a few days later, the prosecutor general had him re-charged and arrested under tough anti-terror laws. The court rejected an objection from Nasheed's lawyers that two of the judges were not suitable to hear the case because they had testified against Nasheed at a police inquiry on the judge's arrest. The court also dismissed four witnesses produced by Nasheed's lawyers before they even testified, saying they were not strong enough witnesses. Nasheed had earlier been charged with abuse of power but prosecutors last month filed more serious charges under the country's terrorism law. The trial was completed after 10 hearings over 23 days. Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director Richard Bennett said: \\"Amnesty International condemns the conviction of Mohamed Nasheed to 13 years in jail by judges who were state witnesses during an earlier investigation of this case. This trial has been flawed from start to finish, and the conviction is unsound.\\" On 16 January 2016, Nasheed, following foreign pressure, was granted permission to leave for the UK by the Maldivian Government to undergo a spinal surgery. According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nasheed \\"was granted permission under the condition to serve the remainder of the sentence upon return to the Maldives after surgery\\". While in London, Nasheed, with the support of lawyer Amal Clooney, has vocally drawn attention to the Maldives' democratic shortcomings. The former president requested an additional 60-day leave extension that was temporarily rejected by the Maldivian authorities. Nasheed contended that a state-owned company once led by Maldives President Abdulla Yameen sold nearly $300 million worth of oil to Myanmar's military dictatorship in the early 2000s; with nearly half the money disappearing. In May 2016, the U.K. government granted Nasheed political refugee status. On November 26, 2018, the Supreme Court overturned Nasheed's sentence, saying that he had been charged wrongfully and the case against him should have not gone to trial.  Speaker of the People's Majlis  On 28 May 2019, Nasheed was elected as Speaker of the People's Majlis, the legislative body of the Maldives, with 67 votes. Awards and recognitions In May 2009 Nasheed was presented with the Coral Cultivation Initiative Award by Huvafen Fushi Resort and Underwater Spa, Maldives in recognition of his active participation in cultivating coral in the resort's nursery as well as for his efforts in creating greater awareness on the impact of climate change in the Maldives.\\"President receives Coral Cultivation Initiative Award\\", www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv One month later, the Anna Lindh Memorial Fund awarded Nasheed the 2009 Anna Lindh Award for the role he played in bringing democracy to the Maldives and in recognition of his efforts \\"to put people and their human rights at the heart of the debate on climate change\\".\\"Anna Lindh Prize 2009 to President of the Maldives\\", www.annalindhsminnesfond.se Copenhagen Climate Change Conference In September 2009 at the global premiere of the film The Age of Stupid, Nasheed was presented with a \\"Not Stupid\\" Award for his efforts to tackle climate change and for the Maldives' announcement to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world.\\"Maldives President 'Not Stupid'\\", doreview.blogspot.com. In the same month, Time magazine named Nasheed to its \\"Leaders & Visionaries\\" category within its annual list of \\"Heroes of the Environment\\".\\"Heroes of the Environment 2008: Leaders & Visionaries: Mohamed Nasheed\\", Ishaan Tharoor, Time. On Earth Day 2010 Nasheed was awarded the United Nations' Champions of the Earth Award. He received it at a gala event in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in conjunction with the B4E Business for the Environment Global Summit. According to a press release by the United Nations Environment Programme, the award was in recognition of Nasheed's being \\"an articulate voice for the vulnerable and the poor facing the challenges of global warming and also a politician who is showcasing to the rest of the world how a transition to climate neutrality can be achieved and how all nations, no matter how big or how small, can contribute\\". That year, he was also named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In March 2011 following his official visit to the Republic of Mauritius, he was decorated by President Anerood Jugnauth and was awarded the highest distinct order of merit in the country, the Grand Commander of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean during the official lunch hosted by Jugnauth at the Ch√¢teau of R√©duit. In a 2011 interview with The Guardian, British Prime Minister David Cameron described Nasheed as 'my new best friend' and said that he, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy and John Key would be the five world leaders Cameron would invite on his stag weekend. On 28 June 2012, Nasheed received the James Lawson Award from the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict at Tufts University in Massachusetts, US. The award was given to \\"recognize his leadership in opposing the long dictatorial regime that lasted before his election and to recognize his opposition to the armed coup earlier this year which forced him from power, and his renewed nonviolent action on behalf of restoring genuine democracy in his country\\".

It is located along the north shore of the Athabasca River at the junction of Highway 33 and Highway 661. It is approximately northwest of Barrhead, southeast of Swan Hills and northeast of Whitecourt. Fort Assiniboine was founded as a trading post by the Hudson's Bay Company and became a stopping point along the Klondike Trail. It gets its name from the Assiniboine people. The fort itself no longer exists, but the land on which it stood is designated as a National Historic Site for its archaeological value. The hamlet, built on and around the site of the fort is a now a local hub for the surrounding agricultural region.  History  Local oral history tells of an early (possibly late 1700s) North West Company fur trading post south of Holmes Crossing (an early ferry crossing) on the Athabasca River. In 1821, the North West Company was merged with Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), who then undertook to reorganize its transportation routes, seeking out advantages and efficiencies in its operations. By then, trade on Lesser Slave Lake was in decline and the council adopted a resolution in 1823 calling for a fort further up the Athabasca River to reduce transport times. Under the new plan, Fort Assiniboine on the Athabasca River (the fort was originally named 'Athabaska River House' ) became the northwest end of an overland horse track to Edmonton House/Fort Edmonton, cut by Jacques Cardinal, a M√©tis free trader, in 1824-25. The trail became known as 'The Hudson Bay Packtrail'.This provided a straighter route from Jasper House and the Athabasca Pass within the Rocky Mountains to York Factory on Hudson Bay. A party on horseback could make the trip from Edmonton to Fort Assiniboine in two to six days, depending on conditions. The new post opened in 1824. The new route was used by the York Factory Express. The old canoe route involved going far north-northeast up the Athabasca to Fort Chipewyan and then southeast through Methye Portage to Lake Winnipeg. Though the fort never grew as large as some other Alberta forts, its role as a transportation hub and provision centre ensured its survival between the 1820s and 1880s. The fort burned to the ground after its abandonment by the Hudson Bay Company. No plans existed for its original layout, but, using clues from post administrators' log books and archaeological surveys, a replica was built on the site in 1980. It operates as a museum and friendship centre. Fort Assiniboine United Church, built in 1948 In 1898, when the Chalmers, or Klondike Trail was cut through the Swan Hills, northwest of Fort Assiniboine to Lesser Slave Lake, the location again became a stopping point, with gold seekers crossing the river with a self-service ferry on their overland trek to the Yukon. The earliest homesteads in the area were filed in 1906 in the Holmes Crossing district (named for the ferryman William B. Holmes), across the Athabasca and downriver from Fort Assiniboine. Most came via Edmonton, by way of the Hudson's Bay Pack Trail, which had been widened by then to accommodate wagons and sleights. The graded road only went to about 16 km (10 miles) west of Morinville. By 1908 settlers crossed on the ferry and took up land north of the Athabasca River, including around the site of the old fort. The Fort Assiniboine post office was set up in 1910, operated, as was the practice, from a local homestead. Joseph Brewster was the first postmaster. A blacksmith's shop, and a store were soon built near the fort site. In 1914, the railway was built to Westlock, shortening the route on the trail significantly. The first community hall was built in 1916. By 1919, the road was graded to Holmes Crossing. The next year, on the north side of the river, a road was graded from the ferry landing, to a bridge on the Freeman River west of Fort Assiniboine. In 1922, the post office was moved to the settlement. The quarter-section of land on which the trading post had been situated had been homesteaded by a Dr. E.J. State in 1913. When he died in 1923, his property was willed to the University of Alberta, who surveyed and sold the lots, expanding the hamlet. In 1927 the railroad was built to Barrhead, only 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. In 1934 the Provincial government set up a public nursing service in the hamlet, which operated until 1969. The surrounding schools were centralised to Fort Assiniboine in 1946 and in the same year a charter was issued for a Fort Assiniboine Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. A United Church and a Roman Catholic Church were built in 1948 and 1949. The curling club was formed and a rink built in 1953. In 1956 a bridge was built over the Athabasca River, putting the ferry out of business. Fort Assiniboine was a hamlet until incorporated as a village in 1958. E.M. (Gene) Redington was the first Mayor. The Village of Fort Assiniboine dissolved and reverted to hamlet status on December 31, 1991. It is now administered by Woodlands County, which has offices in the hamlet and in the Town of Whitecourt.  Notable people who passed through Fort Assiniboine during fur trade days  During its years as an important transportation hub between Edmonton and Lesser Slave Lake, and Edmonton and the Rocky Mountains along the Athabasca River, many explorers, missionaries and other notable people passed through the fort, confirmed by reports and diaries. * David Thompson - explorer * John Rowand - factor at Fort Edmonton * Sir George Simpson - Governor in Chief of the Hudson's Bay Company * Dr. John McLoughlin - Hudson's Bay Company factor and Superintendent * Alexander Ross - fur trader * Paul Kane - Irish-Canadian painter * Pierre-Jean de Smet - Catholic missionary * Robert Rundle - Methodist missionary * Alfred Garrioch - Anglican priest * John Macoun - Irish-Canadian naturalist  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort Assiniboine recorded a population of 176 living in 78 of its 83 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 155. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Attractions  24' Wagon Wheel and Pick Axe at Fort Assiniboine Fort Assiniboine is home to a Hudson Bay style historical museum, known as the Fort Assiniboine Museum and Friendship Club Drop-In Centre, and the \\"World's Largest Wagon Wheel and Pick Axe\\". A boat launch east of the hamlet provides river-boaters access to the Athabasca River. There is also a private R.V. park and marina, which hosted the Athabasca River Voyageur Canoe Bridade in June 2017, celebrating Canada's 150th birthday. A farmer's market is held every Friday afternoon from May to September in the Recreation and Agriculture Building, which also hosts agricultural and sports events throughout the year including the annual Hamlet Hoedown Rodeo & Fair, held each August.

The band started in 1981 from a pool of musicians who were, at the time, playing all kinds of different types of music for the (then) Ballet Rambert, based in London. A new ballet was choreographed (called \\"Ghost Dances\\") about political oppression in South America, to the music of Inti- Illimani, the exiled Chilean folk group. The company preferred to use live musicians (rather than tapes) for performances, and six of the musicians volunteered. Authentic instruments were procured, and some time was spent perfecting how to play them. The show was a hit and before long the band was offered a recording contract by Coda Records, a subsidiary of Beggars Banquet Records. Incantation was chosen as the band's name, based on the word \\"Inca\\". Members of the various incarnations of the band include Tony Hinnigan (Scottish), Mike Taylor (Irish), Forbes Henderson (English), Simon Rogers (English), Chris Swithinbank, and Chileans Claudia Figuerora, Sergio Avila and Mauricio Venegas.

The Black Hawk Purchase, which can sometimes be called the Forty-Mile Strip or Scott's Purchase, extended along the West side of the Mississippi River from the north boundary of Missouri North to the Upper Iowa River in the northeast corner of Iowa. It was fifty miles wide at the ends, and forty in the middle, and is sometimes called the \\"Forty-Mile Strip\\". The land, originally owned by the Sauk, Meskwaki (Fox), and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Native American people, was acquired by treaty following their defeat by the United States in the Black Hawk War. After being defeated the Sauk and Mesquakie were forced to relinquish another 2.5 million hectares or (6 million acres) and give up their rights to plant, hunt, or fish on the land. The purchase was made for $640,000 on September 21, 1832 and was named for the chief Black Hawk, who was held prisoner at the time the purchase was completed. The Black Hawk Purchase contained an area of 6 million acres (24,000 km¬≤), and the price was equivalent to 11 cents/acre ($26 per km¬≤). The region is bounded on the East by the Mississippi River and includes Dubuque, Fort Madison, and present-day Davenport. About The treaty was made by General Winfield Scott and the Governor of Illinois, John Reynolds, at what is now Davenport, Iowa, on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The agreement was ratified February 13, 1833, and officially went into effect on June 1, 1833, when the territory became the first section of what is now Iowa to be opened for settlement by non-Native Americans: United States citizens, or Europeans. Description In \\"Treaty With the Sauk and Foxes, 1832\\", the land was described as follows: all the lands to which the said tribes have title, or claim, (with the exception of the reservation hereinafter made,) included within the following bounds, to wit: Beginning on the Mississippi River at a point where the Sac and Fox northern boundary line, as established by the second article of the Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien, July, 1830, strikes said river; thence up said boundary line to a point 50 miles [80 km] from the Mississippi measured on said line; thence in a right line to the nearest point on the Cedar River, of Iowa, 40 miles [60 km] from the Mississippi; thence in a right line to a point in the northern boundary of the State of Missouri, 50 miles [80 km] measured on said boundary from the Mississippi River; thence by the last mentioned boundary to the Mississippi River, and by the western shore of said river to the place of beginning.\\"'' According to The Making of Iowa (1900), \\"The Black Hawk Purchase extended along the west side of the Mississippi River from the north boundary of Missouri north to the Upper Iowa River. The Upper Iowa River is in the northeast corner of Iowa, and must not be confounded with the Iowa River in the southern half of the state. This is than where the tract extended from Missouri nearly to Minnesota. It was 50 miles [80 km] wide at the ends, and 40 in the middle.\\" According to The History of Jefferson County, Iowa (1879), \\"This was a strip of land on the west bank of the Mississippi River, the western boundary of which commenced at the southeast corner of the present county of Davis; thence to a point on Cedar River, near the northeast corner of Johnson County; thence northwest to the neutral grounds of the Winnebagoes; thence to the Mississippi to a point above Prairie du Chien...\\" Still another history describes it as extending from the Yellow River in the north to the Des Moines River in the south. Two areas were held back as special awards; one was assigned to the chief Keokuk and his Sauk people in thanks for their neutrality (later known as Keokuk's Reserve); the other was given to \\"half- breed\\" translator Antoine LeClaire. (Note: LeClaire's reserve was different from the Half-Breed Tract, which was designated and set aside west of the Missouri River before the Black Hawk Purchase.) The land of the purchase was successively governed by the legislatures of the Michigan Territory, the Wisconsin Territory, Iowa Territory and finally Iowa. The Black Hawk Purchase was followed by the so-called Second Black Hawk Purchase (1837) and New Purchase (1842). See also *Enos Lowe References External links *A.T.

It is one of five secondary schools under the district of the Des Moines Public Schools. The school's mascot is a polar bear and the school competes in the Central Iowa Metro League conference. History North High started as the Forest Home School with four rooms, three departments (primary, intermediate, and higher grades), and three teachers. In 1885, Dr. John A. Nash gave North Des Moines The Forest Home School. it was located on Forest Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets. By 1889, two rooms had been added to the school, which was established as a high school during that year. The first high school curriculum was made up of college entrance subjects: English, Latin, Greek, German, mathematics, science, history, and some art and music. In 1892, the school colors were chosen. During this year, a parade was held in Des Moines, and the schools marched wearing their school colors. Miss Louise Patterson, principal of North, suggested that pink and green be used (North had previously been without colors). Later in 1894, a committee was appointed to select school colors. After several combinations had been considered, one boy looked out the window and saw pink blossoms set against the green leaves of a crab apple tree. ‚ÄúWhy not pick the colors which we have already used,‚Äù he said. The committee then chose pink and green as the official colors of North High School. In 1896, North moved into a new $30,000 building located at Eighth Street and College Avenue. That building is Moulton Elementary School today. In 1915, North High was enlarged with a second section on the North side of the school. The original building was removed in the late 1950s and the second section was remodel for the elementary school. In 1957, North High was moved from Eight and College to the present site at Sixth and Holcomb Streets. The new building cost $3,335,397: total area of the school grounds including the athletic field is 34.5 acres. In 1989, North High celebrated 100 years of serving this community. Examine the pictures of some of the outstanding graduates in the Athletic or Alumni Hall of Fame. You will soon recognize the important role North has played in helping develop local and national leadership. In 2010, the school started a multimillion-dollar renovation which includes new offices, internet wiring, bio-thermal heating and cooling, new windows, paint, new ceilings and flooring and countless other improvements. On September 14, 2015, 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama visited North High along with United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan for a back-to-school bus tour. This event celebrated how states and communities are working to increase access and opportunity from early learning to college. Friday, October 16, 2015, long-time governor Terry Branstad signed a proclamation at North declaring the month of October as College Application Month in Iowa. The purpose of the proclamation was to make students and their families aware of the importance of completing and submitting college applications early on in the process. In addition to the countless improvements in the school's outside skeleton, the new administration has set its eyes on raising the bar in the classroom by looking at new innovative teaching methods. Most notably, Des Moines Public Schools partnered with Learning Sciences International for the 2016-2017 school year to make North a Demonstration School, a school focused on rigorous coursework where students work more collaboratively with their peers. Faculty Benjamin Graeber replaced Mike Vukovich as principal of North High School in mid-2017. Vuokovich made many efforts to improve the school. Extracurricular activities North has a variety of extracurricular activities, the most notable of which is the Academic Decathlon team, which has a long history of success, including a placement of 7th in the nation in the Medium School e-Nationals (2012), a placement of fourth in the state in 2011, and has won the regional competition in 2011 and 2012. Athletics The Polar Bears are members of the Central Iowa Metro League, and participate in the following sports: *Fall ** Football ** Volleyball ** Cross Country *** 6-time State Champions (1944, 1945, 19546, 1950, 1952, 1953) ** Boys' golf ** Girls' swimming *Winter ** Basketball ** Bowling ** Wrestling ** Boys' swimming *** 2-time State Champions (1938, 1942) * Spring ‚Äî ** Track and field *** Boys' 7-time State Champions (1917, 1919, 1934, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1959) ** Soccer ** Tennis ** Girls' golf * Summer ** Baseball *** 3-time State Champions (1931, 1934, 1936) ** Softball In 2016, ESPN covered North High football and their turnaround story behind Major Sean Quinlan. Curriculum The school day is split into 4 blocks lasting 85 minutes that meet every other day and a 'skinny' period that lasts for 45 minutes and meets every day. The school district requires that students take a number of core academic courses, if they wish to graduate and receive a diploma. This includes social studies, English, mathematics, science, art, and physical education. The exact amount of academic credit needed to satisfy graduation requirements is determined by the school district. All students are required by the district to enroll in four subject courses and a Physical Education course. However, the school compels lower-class students to schedule a full day of classes, in order to ensure satisfaction with district graduation requirements. Juniors and Seniors have the option of having an \\"open period\\" during the first or last period of the school day (Seniors may have open periods during any period). However, Juniors require parental permission to have an open period. All students are required to take finals. From being one of the bottom schools in the State of Iowa, North has tightened up his standards, raised consistently its expectations of its students and faculty. North has many visitors from around the country to see what they can come away with to help their students. North is the largest school in Iowa to provide a laptop for every student and faculty member, which it did in the 2011-2012 school year. In 2013-14 school year, North stopped the use of the Apple Mac laptops in favor of the IPAD. So far no data has been generated to show that this has increased academic scholarship among the student body. North has also required all athletes to maintain a \\"C\\" average or above to be eligible to participate in athletics. Notable alumni * Herbert W.

History  Textile was developed by Dean Allen in 2002, which he billed as \\"a humane web text generator\\" that enabled you to \\"simply write\\". Dean created Textile for use in Textpattern, the CMS he also developed about the same time. Textile is one of several lightweight markup languages to have influenced the development of Markdown.  Programming language implementations  Textile was originally written in PHP (maintained as PHP-Textile), and has since been translated into Perl, Python (Python- Textile), Ruby, JavaScript (Textile-JS), and C#. A Java implementation used to exist called \\"Textile-J\\", but it was merged into the Mylyn WikiText project. = Standardization = There is no standard nor a working specification at this time. However, there is a Textile \\"organization\\" on GitHub that invites contributions toward the creation of a common specification across Textile implementations.  Doctype support  Text marked-up with Textile converts into valid HTML when rendered in a web browser, and though it probably varies from one implementation type to another, an installation of Textile can be set for a Doctype Declaration of XHTML or HTML5, with XHTML being the default for backward compatibility. In the PHP implementation, for example, when using Textile's all-caps abbreviation syntax ‚Äì \`AGE(A Given Example)\` ‚Äì the result will render as an \`abbr\` element in HTML5 and as an \`acronym\` element in XHTML. Likewise, as of PHP version 3.5, if you use alignment markers in Textile's image syntax, HTML5 will get extra classes on the rendered \`img\` element, while XHTML remains with the \`align\` attribute.

It centered on the belief that the patriots' daughters should be raised to uphold the ideals of republicanism, in order to pass on republican values to the next generation. In this way, the \\"Republican Mother\\" was considered a custodian of civic virtue responsible for upholding the morality of her husband and children. Although it is an anachronism, the period of Republican Motherhood is hard to categorize in the history of Feminism. On the one hand, it reinforced the idea of a domestic women's sphere separate from the public world of men. On the other hand, it encouraged the education of women and invested their \\"traditional\\" sphere with a dignity and importance that had been missing from previous conceptions of Women's work. Republicanism and women's roles With the growing emphasis being placed on republicanism, women were expected to help promote these values; they had a special role in raising the next generation. In Linda K. Kerber's article \\"The Republican Mother: Women and the Enlightenment - An American Perspective\\", she compared republican motherhood to the Spartan model of childhood,Linda K. Kerber, \\"The Republican Mother: Women and the Enlightenment ‚Äì An American Perspective,\\" in Toward an Intellectual History of Women: Essays by Linda K. Kerber (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997), p. 43. where children are raised to value patriotism and the sacrificing of their own needs for the greater good of the country. By doing so, the mothers would encourage their sons to pursue liberty and roles in the government, while their daughters would perpetuate the domestic sphere with the next generation. In addition, women were permitted to receive more of an education than they previously had been allowed. Abigail Adams advocated women's education, as demonstrated in many of her letters to her husband, the president John Adams (see Abigail Adams). =Religion= Many Christian ministers, such as the Reverend Thomas Bernard, actively promoted the ideals of republican motherhood. They believed this was the appropriate path for women, as opposed to the more public roles promoted by Mary Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries. Traditionally, women had been viewed as morally inferior to men, especially in the areas of sexuality and religion.Porterfield, Mary Lyon, 1997 However, as the nineteenth century drew closer, many Protestant ministers and moralists argued that modesty and purity were inherent in women's natures, giving them a unique ability to promote Christian values with their children.Amanda Porterfield, Mary Lyon and the Mount Holyoke Missionaries (1997) =Education of women= By the early 19th century, towns and cities were making new opportunities available for girls and women. Especially influential were the writings of Lydia Maria Child, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, and Lydia Sigourney, who developed the role of republican motherhood as a principle by equating a successful republic with virtuous families. The idea that women were best suited in these roles are based on the essentialist assumptions that they are biologically predetermined to be intimate and concerned observers of young children. By the 1830s, these New England writers became respected models and were advocates for improving education for females. Greater educational access included making once male-only subjects of classical education, such as mathematics and philosophy, integral to curricula at public and private schools for girls. The number of girls' academic schools in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic increased rapidly beginning in the mid-19th century. By the late 19th century, such schools were extending and reinforcing the tradition of women as educators and supervisors of American moral and ethical values.Sarah Robbins, \\"'The Future Good and Great of our Land': Republican Mothers, Female Authors, and Domesticated Literacy in Antebellum New England\\", New England Quarterly 2002 75(4): 562‚Äì91, in JSTOR History of republican motherhood The term \\"republican motherhood\\" was not used in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. It was first used in 1976 to describe the American ideal by the historian Linda K. Kerber, in her article \\"The Republican Mother: Women and the Enlightenment ‚Äì An American Perspective\\" and then again in 1980 in her book Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America. The historian Jan Lewis subsequently expanded the concept in her article \\"The Republican Wife: Virtue and Seduction in the Early Republic,\\" published in the William and Mary Quarterly (1987). The early seeds of the concept are found in the works of John Locke, the notable seventeenth-century philosopher, particularly his Two Treatises of Government. In his First Treatise, he included women in social theory, and in his Second Treatise defined their roles more clearly. As Kerber quotes in her 1997 essay, Locke wrote: \\"[T]he first society was between man and wife, which gave beginning to that between parents and children... conjugal society is made by a voluntary compact between man and woman.\\"Kerber (1997), \\"Republican Mother,\\" p. 44. In other words, contrary to the traditional sexual hierarchy promoted by his contemporary Robert Filmer and others, Locke believed that men and women had more equal roles in a marriage. Women were expected to focus on domestic issues, but Locke's treatises helped appreciation of the value of the domestic sphere. Although Locke argued less in support of women after he had dissected Filmore's writings, his treatises were influential in highlighting the role of women in society. Long-term influence Although the notion of republican motherhood initially encouraged women in their private roles, it eventually resulted in increased educational opportunities for American women, as typified by Mary Lyon and the founding in 1837 of \\"Mount Holyoke Female Seminary\\", later Mount Holyoke College. The ideal produced women with initiative and independence; as Kerber says, it was \\"one side of an inherently paradoxical ideology of republican motherhood that legitimized political sophistication and activity.\\"Linda K. Kerber, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980), 145. Educated Northern women became some of the strongest voices and organizers of the abolitionist movement, which blossomed in the 1830s and 1840s. Working on civil rights for enslaved people caused women to realize they themselves were enslaved by the patriarchy and wanted rights for themselves, giving rise to the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, and the women's rights movement in the United States. They worked for suffrage, property rights, legal status and child custody in family disputes. The movement likely owes a debt to the emphasis on republican motherhood of fifty years before. The origins of republican motherhood The first presence of republican motherhood was seen in Classical Rome during the years 600 BC to 500 CE. In Classical Rome, women played a much larger role in society than women in other societies around the world did during that period in time. In the eyes of Classical Romans, the familia, or family, was the core of their civilization, and this yielded relatively healthy marriages between Roman men and women. In Merry Wiesner-Hanks book Gender in History: Global Perspectives, she details the \\"model marriage\\" through the eyes of Classical Romans as \\"one in which husbands and wives were loyal to one another and shared interests, activities, and property.\\". Due to the vital role that women and mothers had in their children's education, they were granted the right to receive and have access to education. This was a rare privilege in Classical civilizations, as women were barred from obtaining education in most cultures around the globe at this time. The example in Rome has been used in more recent times all across the world in the fight for women's suffrage, and was a main argument that mothers and women made in the United States during the years leading up to 1920, when the 19th Amendment finally awarded women the right to vote.

The Eastville ward covers the areas of Eastville, Crofts End (also known as Clay Hill), Stapleton and part of Fishponds. Notable places within the ward include Bristol Metropolitan College ( formerly Whitefield Fishponds Community School) and Colston's School, and the Bristol and Bath Railway Path also passes through the ward.  Eastville  Eastville Park Eastville is an inner-suburb of the English city of Bristol, situated between Easton and Frome Vale wards in the north-east of the city. In the north-west its boundary is the M32 motorway, which roughly follows the River Frome. Eastville Stadium (on the west bank of the Frome) used to be the home of Bristol Rovers Football Club, as well as being a site for greyhound racing and speedway, but this site has now been developed by IKEA. Eastville Park is a large park with a small lake, just to the east of the M32. The lake at Eastville Park was instigated as part of a social scheme by Ernest Bevin (a well-respected westcountryman), who later became Minister of Labour under Churchill in the coalition government of WW2 and later Foreign Secretary in the Attlee Government from 1945 until his death. A large railway viaduct known as 'The Thirteen Arches' for obvious reasons, once ran through the area, roughly parallel to the current Muller Road; it was demolished in 1968. This was part of the Clifton Extension Railway. The Eastville Workhouse, originally the Barton Regis Union Workhouse, was a former French Prison which was bought from the Government circa 1832. In 1930, the Stapleton Workhouse, originally the Bristol Union Workhouse, became the Stapleton Institution and by the Second World War the site was mainly used for the care of the mentally ill and the elderly; eventually becoming Blackberry Hill Hospital.  Crofts End  Crofts End (also known as Clay Hill) is a suburb of Bristol. It is an industrialised area, with many small Victorian houses, built when this area was a coal mining community. = Churches = Crofts End Church was established in 1895 by George Brown, as a Christian work for miner's children in The Freestone Rank, Whitehall Road, it became known as The Miner's Mission. It is now part of the local and much wider community but still very much a family church. The pastor is Andrew Yelland. The church was built on a site bounded by market gardens, a brick works and Deep Pit Colliery. When The Beaufort Arms, then known as The Beatem and Wackem and now called The Wackum Inn was the place where most miners spent their hard earned wages! Hence the need for a children's work in that community. Another local church was Clay Hill Chapel which was demolished when the industrial estates were built. = Industry = Over many years, the Market Gardens became housing, White's Brick Works became Somers Wood Yard (now an industrial pallet site) ‚Äì and Deep Pit Colliery became industrial estates. When Deep Pit closed, men were having to walk underground as far as Frenchay to reach the coal face. = Housing = Crofts End House, located at the junction of Plummer's Hill and Whitehall Avenue, still exists, but no longer as a single dwelling. It has been refurbished and is now part of a housing association development.

The band broke up in 1995 with lead vocalist Jett Pangan forming another band, the Jett Pangan Group. The Dawn reunited in late 1999. The Dawn is considered the \\"longest-lived and most prolific rock band in the Philippines\\". History =Formation and early years (1985‚Äì1988)= The Dawn was formed in 1985 by Teddy Diaz (vocals and guitars), JB Leonor (drums), and Clay Luna (bass). The band's name was derived from a portrait of the Holy Spirit that symbolized the dawn of a new day (probably found in a book given by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit to Teddy Diaz, as well as a crucifix which Teddy also received from the same sisterhood), called The Dawning of the Holy Spirit. Diaz, Leonor and Luna initially wanted a female vocalist; but in the course of their search, Jett Pangan auditioned and got the trio's unanimous nod. The quartet began performing in clubs and eventually recorded a demo of a song entitled \\"Enveloped Ideas\\", a copy of which they submitted to DWXB 102.7, a now-defunct Metro Manila‚Äìbased FM radio station that played alternative rock and new wave music. It topped the radio station's charts in 1986, helping the group gain a cult following. While The Dawn was in search of a major record label, Luna left the band to immigrate to the US. Carlos \\"Caloy\\" Balcells, bass player of another Filipino group, the Cicada Band, soon replaced him. In 1986, The Dawn signed with OctoArts International (now PolyEast Records Philippines) and, the next summer, released their eponymous debut album, which gained commercial success. Many critics felt that The Dawn would fill the void left behind by the Juan de la Cruz Band when their music slowly faded in the 1980s. Heavily influenced by the new wave genre of the 1980s, \\"Enveloped Ideas\\" is distinct for its introductory operatic vocals a la Klaus Nomi. =Diaz's death, new guitarist, later albums and disbandment (1988‚Äì1995)= At the height of their popularity, and just weeks after the release of their second album I Stand With You, containing the title track, \\"Magtanim Ay 'Di Biro\\" and \\"Love (Will Set Us Free)\\", after that, Diaz was stabbed to death in front of his girlfriend's house on August 21, 1988 by two men allegedly under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Despite the demise of Diaz, his influence is still felt among many guitarists today and he has become a legend among many Filipino musicians. The Dawn still considers Diaz to be the band's driving force to this day. The band continued to play, at one time employing the services of a masked guitarist (nicknamed \\"Zorro\\" by some fans - is actually rock guitar virtuoso Noel Mendez who will eventually form the band HAYP) in the absence of a permanent guitar player. Atsushi Matsuura, a Japanese guitarist who had earlier released a solo album in the Philippines under Ivory Records, took on lead guitar duties in January 1989 as the band released Beyond the Bend. Matsuura was featured on the music video of \\"Salamat\\". He was later replaced by Francis Reyes, former Afterimage guitarist, who was also a disc jockey at NU-107, a local alternative rock radio station. Reyes also happened to be Diaz's close friend. Classically trained session keyboardist Millette Saldajeno also joined the band in 1990 but was later replaced by Isidore Fernandez in 1992. In 1995, the band went their separate ways due to Pangan's desire to move on with another career. Pangan then formed the Jett Pangan Group. The 1997 reunion at the ULTRA brought the band back on-stage and, for the first time, the band employed two guitarists: Matsuura and Reyes. They did another reunion show at the now defunct ABG's along Pasong Tamo, while they were discussing a comeback release through Sony Music Philippines (now Sony BMG Music Philippines). =Reunion, US shows, Prodigal Sun and Harapin (1999‚Äì2005)= On December 31, 1999, they reunited with both Francis Reyes and Atsushi Matsuura on guitars and performed on GMA Networks' 2000 Global Millennium Day Broadcast in Ayala Avenue in Makati City. That year, they also recorded Prodigal Sun, an album that, much like the parable of the Prodigal Son, symbolized their return to the music scene. Jett Pangan performing onstage. 2001 saw the band actively engaged in the live circuit, embarking on an 8-city US tour and were in New York City when 9/11 turned the World Trade Center into ground zero. In 2003, Carlos Balcells left the band in order to perform his duties as city councilor in his native Talisay City, Negros Occidental. Wolfgang's bass player Mon Legaspi took his place in the band. A few months later, the band once again parted with Matsuura and returned to being a quartet. In 2004, the band released Harapin (Filipino, \\"To Face\\"), featuring singles such as Tulad ng Dati (\\"Just Like Before\\") and Laging Narito (\\"Always Here\\"). In October 2005, bass player Mon Legaspi amicably left the band to pursue other projects and was replaced by Buddy Zabala, formerly of The Eraserheads. Around this time, The Dawn also contributed to the APO Hiking Society tribute album kami nAPO muna with a cover of Bawat Bata (\\"Every Child\\"). =Tulad ng Dati, Later Half of Day (2006‚Äì2009)= In 2006, an independent film based on the band's history was released. Tulad Ng Dati (Just Like Before, as entitled in the Pusan International Film Festival) won Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Picture in the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival. It was also the country's entry to the Hawaii International Film Festival. The Dawn's 20th anniversary album, a two-disc set of the same title was released in October of the same year. Disc one contains re-recordings of their hits through the years and the carrier single Ang Iyong Paalam (\\"Your Farewell\\"), while disc two contains videos, including rare footage of Teddy Diaz doing a guitar solo. In October 2008, The Dawn launched their tenth studio album, The Later Half of Day, their first album in two years since the last released in 2006. It featured jazz re-arrangements of their old songs. =Reyes' departure, Sound the Alarm (2009‚Äì2013)= Francis Reyes, who had been with the band for the last 18 years, left on April 16, 2009 after what Jett Pangan called a \\"hard meeting\\". Pangan also went on to state that Reyes was welcome to rejoin the band. He was replaced by Kenneth Ilagan, days later. In July 2009, the band launched their eleventh studio album, Sound The Alarm. The album features Kenneth Ilagan, formerly of True Faith and Xaga (a precursor to Rivermaya). =Sancho's arrival, Simulan na Natin EP (2013‚Äì2015)= In 2013, In a Myx.com interview, Pangan will make a new material with the band. He stated, \\"I think I'm gonna write more songs\\". On July 14, 2014, they released a new single entitled \\"Habulan\\". Guitarist Rommel \\"Sancho\\" Sanchez, known as a member of Cynthia Alexander's band joined the band on August 8, 2014. Sanchez's first performance with The Dawn was at The Music Museum. This event marks the launch of their new single \\"Landmarks\\". On December 9, 2015, The Dawn was awarded the Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino in the 2015 Awit Awards held at the Music Museum. They had released their first EP, Simulan Na Natin on December 16, 2015 at record stores nationwide and on January 10, 2016 through iTunes. On February 10, 2016, the band launched their YouTube channel which also launched a new music video for \\"The Way It Turns\\". =Band members' return, anniversary shows, and upcoming 12th studio album (2016‚Äìpresent)= On June 7, 2016, the band underwent another line-up change as bassist Buddy Zabala left the band due to unknown reasons, while bassist Carlos Balcells and guitarist Francis \\"Brew\\" Reyes were brought back, thus returning as a quintet for the first time since 2004. By the later dates in June and July 2016, former member Mon Legaspi briefly returned to the band filling bass duties for Carlos Balcells who was unavailable at that time. Legaspi would begin touring with them months later and would eventually be the band's regular bassist due to the dissolution of Wolfgang and Balcells being mostly pre-occupied with their family businesses. This year would also mark the band's 30th anniversary. In line with the celebrations, they held a concert last September 17 dubbed The Dawn Trenta at Craft BGC in Taguig City. They would later perform at the Trenta Repeat concert on November 5, 2016 at the Music Museum. They would perform a follow-up to their 30th anniversary concert dubbed \\"Trenta y Uno\\" on March 31 and also announced they will be having a US and Canada tour on the third quarter of the year. On October 11, 2017, vocalist Jett Pangan made a Facebook post that the band had begun writing and recording for their upcoming 12th studio album. As of 2018, the band released the songs \\"Merry Go Round\\" and \\"Segurista\\" as well as the album Ascendant by way of a major concert at The Music Museum last July 28, 2018 with the newest song being \\"Made of You\\".

It shares the genus Leptodon with the extremely rare white- collared kite. It breeds from eastern Mexico and Trinidad south to Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and northern Argentina. Description Immature, light morph in Pantanal, Brazil The gray-headed kite is 46‚Äì53 cm in length and weighs 410-605 g. The adult has a grey head, black upperparts, white underparts, and a black tail with two or three white bars. The bill is blue and the legs grey. The flight is a deliberate flap-flap-glide. Immature birds have three colour morphs; the light phase is similar to the adult, but has a white head and neck, with a black crown and eyestripe, black bill and yellow legs, closely resembling the Black and White Hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus). The rufous phase has a reddish neck with a white throat, black malar stripes and a black, long crest closely resembling the adult Ornate Hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus). The dark phase has a blackish head, neck and upper parts, and dark-streaked buff underparts. The sophistication in the mimicry of these juveniles is remarkable and has only been described a few times. Ecology In Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica The gray-headed kite feeds mainly on reptiles, but also takes frogs and large insects. It usually sits on an open high perch from which it swoops on its prey. The call is a mewling keow. The nest is made of sticks lined with grass and is built high in a tree. The clutch is one or two white eggs, purplish at one end and spotted brown.

The manga was serialized in Hana to Yume from 1987 to 1991 and published in English by Viz Media. It has been adapted into a six-episode anime OVA and a live-action television series. The anime episodes refer directly (through narration giving the volume number) to events in the manga. The manga storyline is somewhat self-referential, as several asides show that the characters are fully aware that they exist in a manga. Yukie Nasu appears frequently as herself, usually with a capital \\"N\\" on her head, to explain away certain loose plot threads. For example, in a story featuring a baseball game taking place in late autumn, one of the characters asked why they weren't playing soccer; Nasu's character appeared and explained that she didn't know the rules for soccer. Plot After suffering from a series of mishaps, Kazuya Hasekawa has finally entered Ryokuto Academy. He is there to get away from his brother and his wife (whom Kazuya had a crush on). Unfortunately, he is assigned to live in the dorm known as Greenwood, a former insane asylum, where the weird students live. His roommate, Shun Kisaragi, looks just like a girl, and Kazuya initially thought he was until he saw Shun in the boys' bathroom. Also there are his next-door roommates, the dorm president Mitsuru Ikeda and his best friend, Shinobu Tezuka. The manga follows the everyday events and antics of Greenwood. Characters =Main characters= * : : Kazuya was raised by his older brother, Kazuhiro, after the death of their parents when they were younger. Kazuya had applied to enter to Ryokuto Academy so he could be just like Kazuhiro. Kazuya had fallen in love with Sumire, his tutor and was heartbroken when she fell in love with Kazuhiro and subsequently married him. Kazuya had lost respect for his brother since then and moved into the dorm to get away from them. Unfortunately, Kazuya suffered injuries due to a car accident, an ulcer and other mishaps that had delayed him from entering the academy. Much to his dismay, he has to deal with the craziness in the Greenwood dorm and the fact that Kazuhiro is the school nurse. Eventually, he gets used to living in the dorm and is voted president of the dorm by Mitsuru. He later falls in love with a delinquent girl, Miya Igarashi, and dates her in the end of the manga and anime. : Portrayed by Yuki Izawa in the Live action. * : : Shun is Kazuya's easygoing roommate. Although Kisaragi resembles a cute, tomboyish girl, he's actually a guy. Shun is the oldest son of the Kisaragi family, who run a chain of traditional Japanese inns. The females in the Kisaragi family inherit the company, but it has no connection with Shun's girlish figure. Surprisingly, Shun is heterosexual and dated a girl in junior high. Shun is very self-confident and proud of his beautiful long hair, and he knows he is so cute. Because he thinks it is the best way to be cool, he does not hesitate to dress like a girl. He can makes sound decisions and is a man of action, and no character believes that Shun is actually feminine. Shun has a younger brother named Reina and an infant sister named Yui. : Portrayed by Hiroki Suzuki in the Live Action. * : : The President of Greenwood dormitory, and best friend of Shinobu Tezuka. The adopted son of the caretaker of the Ikeda temple in Tokyo, Mitsuru looks like Kazuya's brother in his younger days, and Mitsuru also seems to enjoy giving Kazuya a hard time. Mitsuru is roommates with Shinobu and lives next door to Kazuya and Shun, creating an interesting foursome. He also has an unusual ability: His face is able to heal any cut or bruise in under a minute. All that rough treatment on Kazuya, however, is merely his way of toughening up Kazuya so he can take Mitsuru's place as Residence Hall President. Also, he tries his best to stay away from his adopted family. Since he was a child, he knew he was adopted, and he knew he didn't really belong, so he tries to distance himself from his adopted family. : Portrayed by Riki Miura in the Live Action. * : : The smartest student living in Greenwood dormitory, and best friend of Mitsuru Ikeda. Unlike Mitsuru, Shinobu is calm and quiet and is unaffected by anything. His near perfect attitude and talent is what drives his cousin Nagisa full of jealousy. : Portrayed by Yuuichi Sato in the live action. =Supporting characters= * : : Kazuya's older brother and the school nurse at Ryokuto Academy. He likes to tease Kazuya, but lovingly cares for him. He is married to Sumire. :Portrayed by: Kengo Ohkuchi * : : Kazuhiro's wife and Kazuya's former crush, now sister-in-law. She cares for both brothers, and affectionately calls Kazuya \\"Ya-kun\\". :Portrayed by: Yukari Fukui * : : A delinquent high school girl, she is the object of affection for Kazuya. She defies her mother's wishes to be with her childhood friend Tenma Koizumi in order to be with Kazuya. She is also friends with Mitsuru. :Portrayed by: Aoi Yoshikura * : : Miya's childhood friend, who is Kazuya's rival for Miya's affection. * : : Shinobu's older cousin, she is insanely jealous of Shinobu since childhood and wants to ruin his life. She once kidnapped Mitsuru and stripped him of his clothes in an attempt to get Shinobu to submit to her, but he managed to foil her plans. She tries again, but accidentally abducts Shun's younger brother, Reina. She has a group of henchman - simply called \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" - to help her with her plans. * : : Shun's younger brother, who is cute and also looks like a girl. He is accidentally kidnapped by Nagisa's men while on his way to visit Shun in the dorm. * : : A senior student at the dorm. He lives with his motorcycle and carries it around with him.

It was founded in 1973, and was owned by North Castle Partners, a private investment firm from Connecticut.\\"Local drug, supplement maker signs pact with Indian supplier \\", Laurence Darmiento, Los Angeles Business Journal, published March 10, 2003, accessed June 4, 2006. Business deals Leiner declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2002, blaming a sudden drop in the price of raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry, which in turn lowered industry prices for the products they manufacture. Surprised by the shift, Leiner was caught with a great deal of now-overpriced material on hand, and they elected to sell their products at a loss in order to maintain market position. They emerged from bankruptcy 42 days later, having paid 25 cents on the dollar for $80 million in debt, while deciding to re-focus their efforts on marketing to large chains. The price drop was later determined to have been caused by collusive price fixing by Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche and BASF, in what the United States Department of Justice termed the largest criminal antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered. On March 10, 2003, Leiner entered into a business relationship with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, the third-largest drug company in India. Under the terms of the agreement, Dr. Reddy would provide generic medications and components, which would in return be packaged and marketed by Leiner. Leiner filed for bankruptcy again on March 10, 2008, citing difficulties related to poor results on a FDA inspection of the company's Fort Mill plant during an inspection in 2007.Chang, Andrea. \\"Leiner Health Products files for bankruptcy protection\\", The Los Angeles Times, published March 11, 2008, accessed March 11, 2008. Leiner indicated that it plans to explore debt restructuring and a sale of the company, and will continue normal operations while doing so. Leiner was sold to NBTY (Nature's Bounty) in June 2008 for over $400MM. Fort Mill accident On April 26, 2006, a flash fire damaged a Leiner pharmaceutical plant in the Lakemont Business Park of Fort Mill, South Carolina. Fire chief David Jennings estimated damages to the plant at $1.1 million, and two of the plant's 600 workers were hospitalized with burns. The fire started in a mixing room, where the workers were blending components for a batch of ibuprofen, and evidence indicates that a spark from the mixing machine ignited a dust explosion. Complaints over business practices In November 2001, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against Leiner for deceptive labeling practices in some of its products containing acetaminophen. It cited numerous examples of Leiner products of this nature labeled with \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" statements and American flags, where the acetaminophen used in the manufacture was derived from foreign sources. On several occasions, Leiner has been forced to recall vitamins or supplements containing iron, which were not packaged in child-proof containers as required by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. On March 12, 2002, they recalled 14,000 bottles of \\"Nature's Valley Women's Formula Multivitamin\\", and on January 28, 2005, they recalled 13,000 bottles of \\"Long‚Äôs Central-Vite Multivitamins\\".\\"CPSC, Leiner Health Products Announce Recall of Multivitamins \\", U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, published January 28, 2005, accessed June 4, 2006.

The killer, Ricky Ray Malone, was allegedly in a drug-induced haze from methamphetamine use at the time he shot Green, and his car contained a mobile meth lab. Green's widow, Linda Green, subsequently filed a lawsuit against several US drug manufacturers and retailers, including Leiner. In the suit, she claimed that the companies deliberately turned a blind eye toward the purchase of their products containing pseudoephedrine by criminals engaged in the manufacture of illegal drugs.

Bodies were buried with grave goods, and offerings of food and drink were made to the dead to ensure that they would not trouble the living. Dead relatives were venerated and sometimes asked for help.Segal, Alan F. Life after death: a history of the afterlife in the religions of the West =Cosmology= None of the inscribed tablets found in 1929 in the Canaanite city of Ugarit (destroyed c. 1200 BCE) has revealed a cosmology. Any idea of one is often reconstructed from the much later Phoenician text by Philo of Byblos (c. 64‚Äì141 CE), after much Greek and Roman influence in the region. According to the pantheon, known in Ugarit as 'ilhm (Elohim) or the children of El, supposedly obtained by Philo of Byblos from Sanchuniathon of Berythus (Beirut) the creator was known as Elion, who was the father of the divinities, and in the Greek sources he was married to Beruth (Beirut = the city). This marriage of the divinity with the city would seem to have Biblical parallels too with the stories of the link between Melqart and Tyre; Chemosh and Moab; Tanit and Baal Hammon in Carthage, Yah and Jerusalem. The union of El Elyon and his consort Asherah would be representation of primordial Cronos and Rhea in Greek mythology, or Roman Saturnus and Ops. In Canaanite mythology there were twin mountains Targhizizi and Tharumagi which hold the firmament up above the earth-circling ocean, thereby bounding the earth. W. F. Albright, for example, says that El Shaddai is a derivation of a Semitic stem that appears in the Akkadian shad√ª (\\"mountain\\") and shaddƒÅ'√ª or shadd√ª'a (\\"mountain-dweller\\"), one of the names of Amurru. Philo of Byblos states that Atlas was one of the Elohim, which would clearly fit into the story of El Shaddai as \\"God of the Mountain(s)\\". Harriet Lutzky has presented evidence that Shaddai was an attribute of a Semitic goddess, linking the epithet with Hebrew ≈°ad \\"breast\\" as \\"the one of the Breast\\". The idea of two mountains being associated here as the breasts of the Earth, fits into the Canaanite mythology quite well. The ideas of pairs of mountains seem to be quite common in Canaanite mythology (similar to Horeb and Sinai in the Bible). The late period of this cosmology makes it difficult to tell what influences (Roman, Greek, or Hebrew) may have informed Philo's writings. =Mythology= In the Baal Cycle, Ba'al Hadad is challenged by and defeats Yam, using two magical weapons (called \\"Driver\\" and \\"Chaser\\") made for him by Kothar-wa-Khasis. Afterward, with the help of Athirat and Anat, Ba'al persuades El to allow him a palace. El approves, and the palace is built by Kothar-wa-Khasis. After the palace is constructed, Ba'al gives forth a thunderous roar out of the palace window and challenges Mot. Mot enters through the window and swallows Ba'al, sending him to the Underworld. With no one to give rain, there is a terrible drought in Ba'al's absence. The other deities, especially El and Anat, are distraught that Ba'al has been taken to the Underworld. Anat goes to the Underworld, attacks Mot with a knife, grinds him up into pieces, and scatters him far and wide. With Mot defeated, Ba'al is able to return and refresh the Earth with rain.Wilkinson, Philip Myths & Legends: An Illustrated Guide to Their Origins and Meanings =Religious practices= Archaeological investigations at the site of Tell es-Safi have found the remains of donkeys, as well as some sheep and goats in Early Bronze Age layers, dating to 4,900 years ago which were imported from Egypt in order to be sacrificed. One of the sacrificial animals, a complete donkey, was found beneath the foundations of a building, leading to speculation this was a 'foundation deposit' placed before the building of a residential house. It is considered virtually impossible to reconstruct a clear picture of Canaanite religious practices. Although child sacrifice was known to surrounding peoples, there is no reference to it in ancient Phoenician or Classical texts. The biblical representation of Canaanite religion is always negative. Canaanite religious practice had a high regard for the duty of children to care for their parents, with sons being held responsible for burying them, and arranging for the maintenance of their tombs. Canaanite deities such as Baal were represented by figures which were placed in shrines often on hilltops, or 'high places' surrounded by groves of trees, such as is condemned in the Hebrew Bible, in Hosea (v 13a) which would probably hold the Asherah pole, and standing stones or pillars. History =The Canaanites= The Levant region was inhabited by people who themselves referred to the land as 'ca-na-na-um' as early as the mid-third millennium BCE.Aubet, Maria E., 1987, 910 The Phoenicians and the West, (Cambridge University Press, New York) p.9 There are a number of possible etymologies for the word. The Akkadian word \\"kinahhu\\" referred to the purple-colored wool, dyed from the Murex molluscs of the coast, which was throughout history a key export of the region. When the Greeks later traded with the Canaanites, this meaning of the word seems to have predominated as they called the Canaanites the Phoenikes or \\"Phoenicians\\", which may derive from the Greek word \\"Phoenix\\" meaning crimson or purple, and again described the cloth for which the Greeks also traded. The Romans transcribed \\"phoenix\\" to \\"poenus\\", thus calling the descendants of the Canaanite settlers in Carthage \\"Punic\\". Thus while \\"Phoenician\\" and \\"Canaanite\\" refer to the same culture, archaeologists and historians commonly refer to the Bronze Age, pre-1200 BCE Levantines as Canaanites; and their Iron Age descendants, particularly those living on the coast, as Phoenicians. More recently, the term Canaanite has been used for the secondary Iron Age states of the interior (including the Philistines and the states of Israel and Judah) that were not ruled by Arameans‚Äîa separate and closely related ethnic group.Tubb, Jonathan. 'The Canaanites (British Museum Press) =Influences= Canaanite religion was strongly influenced by their more powerful and populous neighbors, and shows clear influence of Mesopotamian and Egyptian religious practices. Like other people of the Ancient Near East Canaanite religious beliefs were polytheistic, with families typically focusing on veneration of the dead in the form of household gods and goddesses, the Elohim, while acknowledging the existence of other deities such as Baal and El, Asherah and Astarte. Kings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the hieros gamos of the New Year, may have been revered as gods. \\"At the center of Canaanite religion was royal concern for religious and political legitimacy and the imposition of a divinely ordained legal structure, as well as peasant emphasis on fertility of the crops, flocks, and humans.\\"abstract, K. L. Noll (2007) \\"Canaanite Religion\\", Religion Compass 1 (1), 61‚Äì92 Moscati, Sabatino. The Face of the Ancient Orient, 2001. Contact with other areas Canaanite religion was influenced by its peripheral position, intermediary between Egypt and Mesopotamia, whose religions had a growing impact upon Canaanite religion. For example, during the Hyksos period, when chariot-mounted maryannu ruled in Egypt, at their capital city of Avaris, Baal became associated with the Egyptian god Set, and was considered identical ‚Äì particularly with Set in his form as Sutekh. Iconographically henceforth, Baal was shown wearing the crown of Lower Egypt and shown in the Egyptian-like stance, one foot set before the other. Similarly Athirat (known by her later Hebrew name Asherah), Athtart (known by her later Greek name Astarte), and Anat henceforth were portrayed wearing Hathor-like Egyptian wigs. From the other direction, Jean Bott√©ro has suggested that Ya of Ebla (a possible precursor of Yam) was equated with the Mesopotamian god Ea during the Akkadian Empire. In the Middle and Late Bronze Age, there are also strong Hurrian and Mitannite influences upon the Canaanite religion. The Hurrian goddess Hebat was worshiped in Jerusalem, and Baal was closely considered equivalent to the Hurrian storm god Teshub and the Hittite storm god, Tarhunt. Canaanite divinities seem to have been almost identical in form and function to the neighboring Arameans to the east, and Baal Hadad and El can be distinguished amongst earlier Amorites, who at the end of the Early Bronze Age invaded Mesopotamia. Carried west by Phoenician sailors, Canaanite religious influences can be seen in Greek mythology, particularly in the tripartite division between the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, mirroring the division between Baal, Yam and Mot, and in the story of the Labours of Hercules, mirroring the stories of the Tyrian Melqart, who was often equated with Heracles. Sources Present-day knowledge of Canaanite religion comes from: * literary sources, mainly from Late Bronze Age Ugarit,Richard, Suzanne Near Eastern archaeology: a reader, Eisenbrauns illustrated edition (1 Aug 2004) , p. 343 supplemented by biblical sources * archaeological discoveries =Literary sources= The ruins of the excavated city of Ras Shamra, or Ugarit Until Claude F. A. Schaefer began excavating in 1929 at Ras Shamra in Northern Syria (the site historically known as Ugarit), and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of clay tablets written in an alphabetical cuneiform, modern scholars knew little about Canaanite religion, as few records have survived. Papyrus seems to have been the preferred writing medium, but whereas in Egypt papyrus may survive centuries in the extremely dry climate, Canaanite records have simply decayed in the humid Mediterranean climate.Olmo Lete, Gregorio del (1999), \\"Canaanite religion: According to the liturgical texts of Ugarit\\" (CDL) As a result, the accounts contained within the Bible represented almost the only sources of information on ancient Canaanite religion. This record was supplemented by a few secondary and tertiary Greek sources: (Lucian's De Dea Syria (The Syrian Goddess), fragments of the Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos (died 141 CE), and the writings of Damascius). More recently, detailed study of the Ugaritic material, of other inscriptions from the Levant and also of the Ebla archive from Tel Mardikh, excavated in 1960 by a joint Italo-Syrian team, have cast more light on the early Canaanite religion.Hillers D.R. (1985)\\"Analyzing the Abominable: Our Understanding of Canaanite Religion\\" (The Jewish quarterly review, 1985) According to The Encyclopedia of Religion, the Ugarit texts represent one part of a larger religion that was based on the religious teachings of Babylon. The Canaanite scribes who produced the Baal texts were also trained to write in Babylonian cuneiform, including Sumerian and Akkadian texts of every genre. The Encyclopedia of Religion - Mcmillan Library Ref. - Page 42 =Archaeological sources= Archaeological excavations in the last few decades have unearthed more about the religion of the ancient Canaanites. The excavation of the city of Ras Shamra (1928 onwards) and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of clay-tablet alphabetic cuneiform texts provided a wealth of new information. Detailed study of the Ugaritic material, of other inscriptions from the Levant and also of the Ebla archive from Tel Mardikh, excavated in 1960 by a joint Italo-Syrian team, have cast more light on the early Canaanite religion.

In the manga, Cesare's father Rodrigo Borgia, a Cardinal, sells his infant son's soul to the Devil as part of a deal that will one day make him Pope (Rodrigo will become Pope with the name of Alexander VI). Cesare is consequently shunned by his father, who is unable to see him as anything but an agent of darkness and reminder of his sin. Increasingly alienated, Cesare eventually comes to rely on the dark powers within himself. He becomes obsessed with the idea of conquest, and is aided in his political machinations by the assassin Don Michelotto. Release See also * Cesare - another manga about Cesare Borgia's early life.

The community was formerly an incorporated town before amalgamating with the surrounding Rural Municipality of Turtle Mountain to form the Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain. Killarney is known for the lake situated within the community. Killarney is located in a rural area, dependent primarily on agriculture and agribusiness. It is approximately from the Canada-US border, south of Brandon and southwest of the provincial capital, Winnipeg.  History  The Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain area is rich in history and tradition. In the late 1800s, the Boundary Commission Trail ran through the southern part of the municipality. North-West Mounted Police used the trail, as they travelled west to the Rockies in an effort to tame the prairies. Prior to this time, the area was home to many Aboriginal people, as well as hunters and trappers taking part in the fur trade. The R.M. of Turtle Mountain was incorporated in 1882. The first Council meeting was held in 1883. The Town of Killarney was officially incorporated in 1906. An Irish land surveyor named John Sidney O'Brien, named Killarney Lake (before that, it was called Oak Lake by Indigenous peoples) after the Lakes of Killarney, in Ireland. Legend has it that as he sat on the shore of the lake, homesick for his native home, he took a bottle of \\"Good Irish\\" from his pack and pouring it into the lake christened it Killarney. The \\"Irish\\"-ness of the community is often used as a tourist attraction with things such as green fire engines, Erin and Kerry Parks, Little Irish Downs, and many other good Irish-themed attractions used to play up this theme. Killarney, Manitoba does not have any actual connection with the town of Killarney, Ireland. Most of the people who originally settled the region were from the Scottish Highlands, the English or were Mennonites or Hutterites of Central European extraction. The local landscape of the area is common to the Westman area and much of the southern province. The land is mainly flat with gently rolling hills breaking the horizon. Numerous tree lined rivers and streams cross the landscape breaking up vast farm fields. The area is rich in agriculture with many local residents actively farming. { one of the rural Killarney schoolhouses, 1940This picture shows a rural schoolhouse in the vicinity, but not the much larger school buildings in the town itself. }  Economy  Agriculture is a large part of Killarney-Turtle Mountain's economy. Killarney boasts a variety of sales and specialized services that help complement the strong agricultural base of the community. In addition, to agriculture, tourism also plays a role in the economy. The municipality attracts as many as 1,500 people each summer to its cottages and playgrounds. Killarney Lake makes up the majority of Killarney's tourism and is the focus of many activities. Killarney has been voted the best retirement town in Canada by Canadian Living Magazine. The community works hard to maintain this reputation and the business community in Killarney provides most all essential goods and services to local residents, ensuring a comfortable and amenable living environment. { Killarney Lake, located within the town of Killarney One of the old grain elevators which was demolished in 2017. }  Government  The Municipality of Killarney - Turtle Mountain is governed by a Mayor and six Councillors. The mayor of the Municipality of Killarney- Turtle Mountain is Rick Pauls who won an uncontested election. The current Councillors are Connie Blixhavn (Deputy Mayor), Randy Hodge, Joan Kemp, Gary King, Greg Ericson, and Janice Smith. Provincially, the Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain has been part of the provincial constituency of Spruce Woods since it was created in the 2008 electoral redistribution. Spruce Woods is represented by Progressive Conservative M.L.A. Cliff Cullen. Federally, the Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain, falls under the federal riding of Brandon-Souris.

State Route 18 (SR 18) is an east-west highway in northern Ohio. It is the sixth longest state route in the state. Its western terminus is at the Indiana state line near Hicksville, where the route continues in Indiana as State Road 8, and its eastern terminus is at State Route 91 in Akron. History State Route 18 was an original state highway that went from Norwalk to the Pennsylvania state line. The route was extended to the Indiana state line in 1926. Until 1950, it was one of a very few Ohio routes to end at two state lines. State Route 18's extension to the Indiana state line originally overlapped State Route 2 from the line to Hicksville. In 1940, State Route 18 was rerouted on the former State Route 193 from the line to Hicksville. In 1950, State Route 18's eastern terminus was moved to Youngstown. Its old route to the Pennsylvania state line was recertified as State Route 289. In 1966, the route was routed along State Route 8 and Interstate 80S (now Interstate 76) to Youngstown. This series of concurrencies ended in 1971, and State Route 18 would eventually be routed along Market Street in Akron, to end at its current terminus. In 1969, State Route 18 was routed concurrently with U.S. Route 20 along the Norwalk Bypass, a limited access freeway. Prior to the Bypass route, State Route 18 followed Main Street and Woodlawn Avenue (formerly known as Medina Street) and later followed Main Street and Akron Road through the city of Norwalk (much of this alignment was already concurrent with US 20). Before the rerouting of SR 18 via SR 8 and I-80S, SR 18 left West Market Street at Twin Oaks Drive in West Akron, where it went a few blocks east to North Portage Path, then jogged 1 block north to Memorial Parkway, which became Tallmadge Avenue east of the Cuyahoga River (before that, SR 18 continued along Market Street, then joined with SR 8 before reaching Tallmadge Avenue). Tallmadge Road was a straight east/west road which became Mahoning Avenue as it approached the Youngstown area. Most stretches of former SR 18 are still referred to as County Road 18 in Portage and Mahoning Counties. SR 18 was realigned around North Baltimore on a two-lane bypass completed in 2012. The new bypass, which included a roundabout at the eastern transition to the original route, was built to facilitate traffic to a new CSX rail yard in Henry Township. The old route through North Baltimore became signed as SR 18 Business. Major intersections SR 18 Business State Route 18 Business (SR 18 Bus.) is a business route through the village of North Baltimore in southern Wood County. The route starts at a T-intersection with SR 18 in Henry Township and runs east into North Baltimore on Deshler Road and West State Street. In the center of the village, the route heads south onto South Main Street. SR 18 Bus. ends at a roundabout with SR 18 in the southern limits of the village. SR 18 Bus. was created in November 2012 along what used to be SR 18 through North Baltimore. When SR 18 was rerouted on a bypass of the village in 2012, the old route became a signed business route. Most of the business route was designated by the Ohio Department of Transportation as SR 18-J though a portion of the route near its western terminus was designated SR 18-C. those designations have been removed and ODOT no longer maintains the business route.

It is commonly used with gallo pinto and tamales, and is also considered particularly complementary with eggs, rice, beans, fish, cheese, curries, and as a marinade for meat. Salsa Lizano is increasingly available commercially throughout North America through online retailers.  History  The sauce was created initially by Pr√≥spero Jim√©nez in his bar in Alajuela, after the success with the neighbors and acknowledging the success of imported bottled condiments, he approached Pr√≥spero Lizano who owned a factory, and then they established the brand and the green label for marketing. In 1991 Best Foods bought the company, and later were acquired by Unilever. In 2020 the condiment celebrated its 100 Anniversary.

He served the National Fantasy Fan Federation as both a Vice-President (1947) and President (1955). Coslet was the only child of Arthur Allen Coslet and Bessie Fodushia Pickett; at age four his right arm was injured and a bone had to be removed because it failed to heal. The family moved to Sunnyside, Washington when he entered 2nd grade, to avoid having to have him vaccinated, but returned to Denton, Montana after Washington also passed mandatory vaccination laws for school aged children. His interest in science fiction began in his early teens and he began collecting in 1937. When his mother objected to his reading science fiction he began reading it in the barn. He graduated from high school in Denton in 1941. The childhood injury to his right arm kept him out of military service in World War II. Coslet attended Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills, Alberta, Canada for one year . Among his early jobs he worked as a truck driver on a ranch and spent a few weeks as a shepherd. After taking the State Merit Test he moved to Helena, Montana for his first real job as a clerk in the Department of Labor in 1944. He stayed with this job for 42 years moving up to examiner, determining people's eligibility for unemployment benefits. Coslet's parents moved from Denton to Helena and took up residence at the Grandon Hotel where Walter already lived. In 1945 he and his mother purchased a house. Coslet's hobby interests grew, including stamp collecting. From being a member of Linn's Weekly Stamp News stamp collector's stamp exchange he met Dorothy Gawne from Amherst, Ohio. The two traded stamps and corresponded for 2 years before actually meeting in person. By this time Gawne was attending L. I. F. E. Bible College in Los Angeles, California. Coslet and his father came to Los Angeles to visit. The next summer Gawne visited Coslet's home in Helena. One year later, after she finished her studies graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Theology degree, Gawne and Coslet were married on August 12, 1947 in Helena. The new family began taking in foster children in 1950, eventually having cared for four. In 1957 the first of their three sons was born. Coslet became well known for his vast knowledge of both science fiction and the Bible. Although he sold his science fiction collection, spanning thirty-five years, in 1972 to a collector in Portland, Oregon (the fanzine collection is now in the Albin O. Kuhn Library at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County), he continued to accumulate science fiction books and magazines until his death. He had one of the largest private collections of English translations of the Bible in the world. The 23 oldest and most valuable items in his Bible collection were auctioned by Bonhams & Butterfields on October 17, 2006 . Coslet's copy of the Golden Legend was auctioned on December 4, 2006 .

The island, now mostly taken up by a public park, is the place where Major John Wesley Powell and Vitaly Develvis started an expedition down the Green River and Colorado River in 1871. The park is also believed to mark where Major Powell started a similar expedition down the two rivers in 1869. Expedition Island was designated a National Historic Landmark for this historic association on November 24, 1968. and Description and history Expedition Island is located in the Green River, which flows roughly east-west south of downtown Green River. The island was originally larger, having been divided into two by subsequent erosive river actions. The northern island is undeveloped and overgrown, and is not believed to be the site of historic activity. The southern island is now a public park, with a recreation center and parking area at the southern end, and a tree-fringed grassy expanse to the north. It is accessible by road bridge from the north bank of the river, and by pedestrian bridge from the south. The park includes a stone marker commemorating the activities of John Wesley Powell. John Wesley Powell (1834-1902), active in the second half of the 19th Century, was one the most important American explorers. He led exploratory expeditions into some of the most inhospitable parts of the American West, notably including the first documented descent of the Grand Canyon. Two expeditions he led, including the one that entered the Grand Canyon, were formally launched from Expedition Island. The first was in 1869 and the second in 1871. These two expeditions are generally considered to have covered the last large land area in the continental United States left unexplored by European-Americans. Today, the city of Green River marks the Powell expedition history with annual events. The channel east of the two islands is used for whitewater rafting and kayaking.

It is secreted into the blood and degrades large vWf multimers, decreasing their activity. Genetics The ADAMTS13 gene maps to the ninth chromosome (9q34). Discovery Since 1982 it had been known that thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), one of the microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (see below), was characterized in its familial form by the presence in plasma of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF). In 1994, vWF was shown to be cleaved between a tyrosine at position 1605 and a methionine at 1606 by a plasma metalloprotease enzyme when it was exposed to high levels of shear stress. In 1996, two research groups independently further characterized this enzyme. In the next two years, the same two groups showed that the congenital deficiency of a vWF-cleaving protease was associated with formation of platelet microthrombi in the small blood vessels. In addition, they reported that IgG antibodies directed against this same enzyme caused TTP in a majority of non-familial cases. Proteomics Genomically, ADAMTS13 shares many properties with the 19 member ADAMTS family, all of which are characterised by a protease domain (the part that performs the protein hydrolysis), an adjacent disintegrin domain and one or more thrombospondin domains. ADAMTS13 in fact has eight thrombospondin domains. It has no hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and hence it is not anchored in the cell membrane. Role in disease Deficiency of ADAMTS13 was originally discovered in Upshaw Schulman Syndrome, the recurring familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. By that time it was already suspected that TTP occurred in the autoimmune form as well, owing to its response to plasmapheresis and characterisation of IgG inhibitors. Since the discovery of ADAMTS13, specific epitopes on its surface have been shown to be the target of inhibitory antibodies. Low levels of ADAMTS13 are also associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease. Finally, since the link between aortic valve stenosis and angiodysplasia was proven to be due to high shear stress (Heyde's syndrome), it has been accepted that increased exposure of vWf to ADAMTS13 due to various reasons would predispose to bleeding by causing increased degradation of vWf. This phenomenon is characterised by a form of von Willebrand disease (type 2a).

Similar in appearance to mice of the genus Mus, spiny mice are small mammals with bare, scaled tails. However, their coats are endowed with unusually stiff guard hairs similar to the spines of a hedgehog; this trait is the source of the common name, spiny mouse. Despite their anatomic similarity to members of the genus Mus, genetic evidence suggests that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to common mice.

Note the shorted tail, probably the result of a degloving injury. Though African spiny mice originated in the deserts of Africa, they are frequently kept as exotic pets in other parts of the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are most commonly referred to as Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are similar to pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. Therefore, the spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a degloving injury. Their diet is also rather hard to maintain because their bodies have odd reactions to certain foods. =Housing= Due to their desert origin, spiny mice thrive at hot temperatures and should be maintained around 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞F). These animals are very social and should always be housed in groups when possible. As spiny mice are prone to obesity, it is important to provide ample space and environmental enrichment to encourage exercise. =Reproduction= Gestation length is between 38 and 42 days. Litters normally consist of 2 to 3 pups, but females may have up to 6 pups in a single litter. Other females within the social group may assist in the birthing process and tend to the newborns. Pups are born with their eyes open; they will begin to leave the nesting area at about 3 days of age. Babies are weaned around 5 to 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at about 6 to 9 weeks. A female can conceive throughout the year and may produce up to 9 litters in a year. Lifespan for spiny mice is 4 to 7 years. The mother is able to become pregnant right after birth.The Oregon Zoo One species of spiny mouse was recently discovered to have a menstrual cycle which would make them important as a model organism to study menstruation and reproductive disorders, as Mus musculus, the common laboratory mouse, does not menstruate.Bellofiore N., et al., First evidence of a menstruating rodent: the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus)  Diabetes  Captive housing of spiny mice in the mid-1960s uncovered their sensitivity to developing diabetes . That is, spiny mice were kept as pets and maintained on bird food consisting of fat-rich pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds. This diet was associated with obesity, glucosuria, and ketosis. Further studies, in the Institute of Biochemistry in Geneva, revealed that spiny mice manifest low insulin secretion capacity, low response to glucose, and faint first-phase insulin release, despite pancreatic iselt hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Notably, they do not show the common symptom of insulin resistance. Also, A. russatus is not known to develop symptoms of diabetes under a similar diet.  Autotomy and tissue regeneration  All studied species of spiny mice, Acomys kempi, A. percivali, A. cahirinus, A. dimidiatus, and A. russatus, are capable of autotomic release of skin upon being captured by a predator. To date, spiny mice are the only mammals known to do so. They can completely regenerate the autotomically released or otherwise damaged skin tissue - regrowing hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage with little or no scarring. It is believed that the corresponding regeneration genes could also function in humans. In a research article published on May 16, 2017 in eLife, a team from the University of Kentucky described the role of macrophages in epimorphic regeneration. The subtype of macrophages found in African spiny mice produces a different immune response than the subtype that elicit scarring.  Disease  Because spiny mice are highly prevalent throughout Africa and rodents are known to be carriers of disease, an investigation into whether spiny mice may carry disease was done in Egypt in 1912. In this investigation it was determined that Acomys harbored only a tenth of the number of fleas compared to wild rats and is thus of little importance of spreading disease.

Rodgers. Originally, Robson was supposed to be on for one episode (\\"The Tip\\") and then never to be seen again. However, series creator Tom Fontana was impressed by Rodgers, so Robson became a regular from the third season to the final episode. Character overview \\"Prisoner #97R492. Convicted November 7, 1997 - Murder in the first degree, assault. Sentence: Life imprisonment, eligible for parole in 25 years.\\" A sadistic racist, Robson is imprisoned for murdering a black man who he saw walking home with his girlfriend. In Oz, Robson acts as Vernon Schillinger's main lieutenant and is one of the most savage members of the Aryan Brotherhood. He is highly regarded by Schillinger until a dentist tells Robson that he had implanted the gums of an African-American into Robson's mouth. Once word gets around, Schillinger casts Robson out of the Brotherhood even though Robson cuts the skin grafts out of his mouth. Without the protection of the Brotherhood, Robson does whatever is necessary to survive, becoming Wolfgang Cutler's sex slave so that Cutler would protect him. Unknowingly, Robson contracts HIV from Cutler. Along with Shirley Bellinger and Moses Deyell, Robson is never housed in Emerald City, and is the only one of the three to survive the series. During his time in the series, Robson is the main enforcer of the Aryans and takes a sadistic pleasure in committing horrific acts of violence and sexual abuse against weaker inmates. Robson is however seen as the weakest and most cowardly member of the Aryans when he is up against stronger inmates. His time as Cutler's slave changes him, however, and at the climax of the series he begins to feel some remorse for his actions. Season 2 In 1997, Robson is forced to bunk with his current cellmate, Peter Vinyard as well as Tobias Beecher and Bob Rebadow, since Emerald City had transferred all of its inmates over to his cellblock after the riot. The whole prison is now under lockdown until things settle down, but until then, the cellblock is overcrowded. Robson tries to force Beecher to perform fellatio on him, but Beecher turns the tables on him by biting off the tip of his penis. Season 3 Robson reappears, this time as a full-fledged member of the Aryan Brotherhood inside of Oz. He serves little purpose in season 3 other than following Schillinger's schemes and encouraging him to do whatever he needs to do to maintain the power of the Brotherhood. He also participates in Oz's boxing tournament, as the Aryans' representative. He faced Cyril O'Reily, but unbeknownst to him, Cyril's older brother Ryan had spiked Robson's drinking water with chloral hydrate (stolen and smuggled from the prison hospital) to make sure Cyril wouldn't lose. Robson, incapacitated by the drug, loses the fight. Season 4 For the first half of the season, Robson is mainly seen as a supporter of Schillinger and the rest of his Aryan brothers, aiding in whatever plot he could. In the latter half, however, he slowly evolves into a more significant character. When Schillinger begins to spend more time with Christian leader Jeremiah Cloutier, Robson temporarily runs the Aryan Brotherhood's business, gradually becoming disillusioned with his former mentor. He is thrown into The Hole after getting in a fight over a joke that the Muslims overheard. Robson blames Muslim leader Kareem Said, and forms an alliance with black inmate Leroy Tidd, who also hated Said for killing his friend, Simon Adebisi. The two plot to kill Said. Tidd pretends to convert to Islam to get close to Said. However, when Tidd's conversion becomes genuine, he pulls out of the plan. Robson then bullies a younger inmate named Carl Jenkins into killing Said by promising to initiate him into the Brotherhood, as well as threatening to sell him as a sex slave (i.e. a prag) to the black inmates if he fails. Jenkins kills Tidd instead when Tidd protects Said, and is thrown into solitary confinement. Cloutier, on Said's behalf, approaches Jenkins and convinces him to give up Robson as the man who ordered the murder. Jenkins does so, but later commits suicide for fear of the Aryans' retaliation. Since prison authorities have no testimony against Robson; he is released from solitary and cleared of the charge. He then enrages Said by taunting him about the deaths of Tidd and Jenkins. Said beats Robson unconscious, further escalating the war between the Aryans and the Muslims. By this time, Schillinger has resumed running the Brotherhood, much to Robson's relief. The war worsens when the Muslims protect Beecher, Schillinger's longtime enemy, when he comes up for parole. When Robson and Schillinger taunt Beecher for losing his parole, Said shanks both of them. They both end up in the hospital with severe stab wounds and deepened rancor toward Beecher and Said. Season 5 Both Robson and Schillinger return to Oz after recovering from their wounds, ready to take revenge. The war is put on hold, however, when Schillinger participates in interaction sessions with Said, Beecher, and Sister Peter Marie to help prevent more violence. When Schillinger finds out that Chucky Pancamo, leader of the Sicilians, had his son Hank killed, he goes after them, and Robson himself shanks Pancamo, putting him in the hospital. Later, Peter Schibetta attempts to stab Schillinger. Schibetta is beaten and gang-raped by Robson, Schillinger, and another Aryan who simultaneously taunt Schibetta with racial slurs and references to his rape by Adebisi. Soon afterward, two new white inmates, Franklin Winthrop and Adam Guenzel, arrive in Oz to serve time for raping a college girl. They are young, scared and weak, and the Aryans used this weakness to their advantage. In Unit B, the Aryans save Winthrop from an overweight black inmate named Clarence Seroy who tries to rape him -- only to keep him as their sexual slave. After parading Winthrop in drag, Robson tells Beecher he would rape Guenzel (a family friend). Beecher then enlists the Italians to protect Guenzel. In the gym, Robson tries to rape Guenzel, but Frank Urbano defends him and puts Robson in the hospital. Schillinger manipulates Guenzel into turning against Beecher, who then retracts his protection. Robson then kills a young Muslim named Ahmad Lalar with the help of another Aryan inmate. When Robson visits the infirmary, prison dentist Dr. Tariq Faraj tells him that he has gum disease and needs new gums grafted from a cadaver. Robson hurls racial slurs at the Pakistani dentist, but agrees to the surgery. After the surgery, however, Faraj takes revenge by telling Robson that his new gums are from a black man. Panicked, Robson asks Schillinger for advice, and Schillinger confers with the outside leader of the Aryan nations. The two leaders conclude that, if in fact Robson received these gums, then he is to be cast out of the gang, as he is no longer considered \\"pure\\". Faraj secretly pays black inmate Arnold \\"Poet\\" Jackson to spread the word about Robson's gums, which actually are those of a black man. In the cafeteria, Poet and Ryan O'Reilly, who hate Robson, announce to the entire prison population that Robson has \\"dirty ghetto gums.\\" Furious, Robson demands to know whose gums were put in his mouth and attacks Faraj, who, after hitting him in the mouth with a phone, lets him know his gums were purposefully donated by a black man. Robson is thrown into the hole and as the outside Aryan Nation leaders learn of this, Schillinger reluctantly kicks Robson out of the Brotherhood. Desperate to get back in, he buys heroin to use as an anaesthetic in an attempt to personally remove his new gums with a razorblade. The heroin turns out to be woefully inadequate as a painkiller, with Robson being almost immediately overcome with severe pain and bringing guards to his cell with his loud screams. After being thrown in solitary, Robson is next seen with the gums fully attached. Season 6 In the final season of Oz, Pancamo recovers from the shank wound Robson gave him and is released from the infirmary. With no allies to back him up, Robson now faces a grave threat from the Italians. He asks for protection from the Aryans, who refuse, except for Wolfgang Cutler, who agrees to protect Robson in return for Robson becoming his sex slave. After talking with Sister Pete, Robson reveals that he was raped by his father when he was six years old, and asks if it is acceptable to do \\"anything\\" to survive. Afterwards, Robson accepts Cutler's offer, who immediately sodomizes him with a spoon. Cutler then forces him to dress in drag and perform bizarre sexual favors. In return, Cutler defends Robson (now his cellmate) from Pancamo. The Italians then offer Robson a deal: they would call a truce if he kills Cutler. Robson tells Sister Pete that Cutler is suicidal and then persuades Cutler to try auto-erotic asphyxiation. The next morning Cutler's body is found in his cell, hanging by a noose tied to the bunkbed. The authorities rule Cutler's death as a suicide. Robson is allowed to re-enter the Brotherhood and now is free from both Cutler and the Italians, but his rape still haunts him. During a visit with his wife, he violently manhandles her to the point where she called him a \\"cocksucker.\\" Angered, Robson assaults her and ends up, once again, in The Hole. Remorseful, he goes to psychotherapy sessions and a rape support group. At the support group meeting, he learns from the other inmates, who all finish their stories of being violated with the phrase \\"I had no choice.\\" He briefly recovers his equilibrium, but soon learns that he is HIV-positive. Department of Corrections standards mean that he is transferred to Unit F, the AIDS ward. Before he goes, he thanks the support group for helping him through the trauma and says that he initially blamed Cutler for his infection, but since he had unprotected sex before, he comes to claim the responsibility as his. In the extended version of the finale \\"Exeunt Omnes\\", Robson is shown once again allowing himself to be raped by black inmate Clarence Seroy (Robson knowing that Seroy will become infected). He then tells Schillinger that he will be transferred to the AIDS ward. As Seroy walks by them, he tells Schillinger that he raped Robson. Schillinger, disgusted that Robson would let a black man rape him, throws Robson out of the Brotherhood for good, with Robson stating that he doesn't care and that not all of the inmates living in the AIDS ward are gay. Robson then tells Seroy to get tested because he might be HIV- positive. Angered, Seroy punches Robson before he is taken away by the COs. Robson then taunts a terrified Schillinger with his blood. He is later transferred out of Oz when the prison becomes contaminated by anthrax; meanwhile, Seroy learns he has been infected with HIV after raping Robson. Murders committed *Unknown black man - Murdered by Robson, while Robson was out on the street with his crew. *Ahmad Lalar - Slashed to death by Robson, while another Aryan pinned him down. *Wolfgang Cutler - Robson tricked Cutler into a playing a sex game and murdered Cutler by tying a ligature around his neck.

Cayley table as multiplication table of the permutation matrices abelian. general (and special) linear group GL(2, 2) In mathematics, D3 (sometimes alternatively denoted by D6) is the dihedral group of degree 3, or, in other words, the dihedral group of order 6. It is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 of degree 3. It is also the smallest possible non-abelian group.. For the identification of D3 with S3, and the observation that this group is the smallest possible non-abelian group, see p. 49. This page illustrates many group concepts using this group as example. Symmetry groups The dihedral group D3 is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, that is, it is the set of all transformations such as reflection, rotation, and combinations of these, that leave the shape and position of this triangle fixed. In the case of D3, every possible permutation of the triangle's vertices constitutes such a transformation, so that the group of these symmetries is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 of all permutations of three distinct elements. This is not the case for dihedral groups of higher orders. :160px The dihedral group D3 is isomorphic to two other symmetry groups in three dimensions: *one with a 3-fold rotation axis and a perpendicular 2-fold rotation axis (hence three of these): D3 *one with a 3-fold rotation axis in a plane of reflection (and hence also in two other planes of reflection): C3v :160px 160px Permutations of a set of three objects Consider three colored blocks (red, green, and blue), initially placed in the order RGB. The symmetric group S3 is then the group of all possible rearrangements of these blocks. If we denote by a the action \\"swap the first two blocks\\", and by b the action \\"swap the last two blocks\\", we can write all possible permutations in terms of these two actions. In multiplicative form, we traditionally write xy for the combined action \\"first do y, then do x\\"; so that ab is the action , i.e., \\"take the last block and move it to the front\\". If we write e for \\"leave the blocks as they are\\" (the identity action), then we can write the six permutations of the set of three blocks as the following actions: * e : RGB ‚Ü¶ RGB or () * a : RGB ‚Ü¶ GRB or (RG) * b : RGB ‚Ü¶ RBG or (GB) * ab : RGB ‚Ü¶ BRG or (RBG) * ba : RGB ‚Ü¶ GBR or (RGB) * aba : RGB ‚Ü¶ BGR or (RB) The notation in brackets is the cycle notation. Note that the action aa has the effect , leaving the blocks as they were; so we can write . Similarly, * bb = e, * (aba)(aba) = e, and * (ab)(ba) = (ba)(ab) = e; so each of the above actions has an inverse. By inspection, we can also determine associativity and closure (two of the necessary group axioms); note for example that * (ab)a = a(ba) = aba, and * (ba)b = b(ab) = bab. The group is non-abelian since, for example, . Since it is built up from the basic actions a and b, we say that the set } generates it. The group has presentation ::\\\\langle r, a \\\\mid r^3 = 1, a^2 = 1, ara = r^{-1} \\\\rangle, also written \\\\langle r, a \\\\mid r^3, a^2, arar \\\\rangle :or ::\\\\langle a, b \\\\mid a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^3 = 1 \\\\rangle, also written \\\\langle a, b \\\\mid a^2, b^2, (ab)^3 \\\\rangle where a and b are swaps and is a cyclic permutation. Note that the second presentation means that the group is a Coxeter group. (In fact, all dihedral and symmetry groups are Coxeter groups.) Summary of group operations With the generators a and b, we define the additional shorthands , and , so that a, b, c, d, e, and f are all the elements of this group. We can then summarize the group operations in the form of a Cayley table: { class=wikitable !*e a b c d f - !e e a b c d f - !a a e d f b c - !b b f e d c a - !c c d f e a b - !d d c a b f e - !f f b c a e d } Note that non-equal non-identity elements only commute if they are each other's inverse. Therefore, the group is centerless, i.e., the center of the group consists only of the identity element. Conjugacy classes We can easily distinguish three kinds of permutations of the three blocks, the conjugacy classes of the group: *no change (), a group element of order 1 *interchanging two blocks: (RG), (RB), (GB), three group elements of order 2 *a cyclic permutation of all three blocks: (RGB), (RBG), two group elements of order 3 For example, (RG) and (RB) are both of the form (x y); a permutation of the letters R, G, and B (namely (GB)) changes the notation (RG) into (RB). Therefore, if we apply (GB), then (RB), and then the inverse of (GB), which is also (GB), the resulting permutation is (RG). Note that conjugate group elements always have the same order, but in general two group elements that have the same order need not be conjugate. Subgroups From Lagrange's theorem we know that any non-trivial subgroup of a group with 6 elements must have order 2 or 3. In fact the two cyclic permutations of all three blocks, with the identity, form a subgroup of order 3, index 2, and the swaps of two blocks, each with the identity, form three subgroups of order 2, index 3. The existence of subgroups of order 2 and 3 is also a consequence of Cauchy's theorem. The first- mentioned is the alternating group A3. The left cosets and the right cosets of A3 coincide (as they do for any subgroup of index 2) and consist of A3 and the set of three swaps }. The left cosets of } are: * { (), (RG) } * { (RB), (RGB) } * { (GB), (RBG) } The right cosets of } are: * { (RG), () } * { (RBG), (RB) } * { (RGB), (GB) } Thus A3 is normal, and the other three non-trivial subgroups are not. The quotient group is isomorphic with C2. G = \\\\mathrm{A}_3 \\\\rtimes H, a semidirect product, where H is a subgroup of two elements: () and one of the three swaps. This decomposition is also a consequence (particular case) of the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem. In terms of permutations the two group elements of are the set of even permutations and the set of odd permutations. If the original group is that generated by a 120¬∞-rotation of a plane about a point, and reflection with respect to a line through that point, then the quotient group has the two elements which can be described as the subsets \\"just rotate (or do nothing)\\" and \\"take a mirror image\\". Note that for the symmetry group of a square, an uneven permutation of vertices does not correspond to taking a mirror image, but to operations not allowed for rectangles, i.e. 90¬∞ rotation and applying a diagonal axis of reflection. Semidirect products \\\\mathrm{C}_3 \\\\rtimes_\\\\varphi \\\\mathrm{C}_2 is \\\\mathrm{C}_3 \\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_2 if both œÜ(0) and œÜ(1) are the identity. The semidirect product is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 6 if œÜ(0) is the identity and œÜ(1) is the non-trivial automorphism of C3, which inverses the elements. Thus we get: :(n1, 0) * (n2, h2) = (n1 \\\\+ n2, h2) :(n1, 1) * (n2, h2) = (n1 ‚àí n2, 1 + h2) for all n1, n2 in C3 and h2 in C2. More concisely, :(n_1, h_1) * (n_2, h_2) = (n_1 + (-1)^{h_1} n_2, h_1 + h_2) for all n1, n2 in C3 and h1, h2 in C2. In a Cayley table: { class=wikitable ! 001020011121 - !00 001020011121 - !10 102000112101 - !20 200010210111 - !01 012111002010 - !11 110121100020 - !21 211101201000 } Note that for the second digit we essentially have a 2√ó2 table, with 3√ó3 equal values for each of these 4 cells. For the first digit the left half of the table is the same as the right half, but the top half is different from the bottom half. For the direct product the table is the same except that the first digits of the bottom half of the table are the same as in the top half. Group action Consider D3 in the geometrical way, as a symmetry group of isometries of the plane, and consider the corresponding group action on a set of 30 evenly spaced points on a circle, numbered 0 to 29, with 0 at one of the reflexion axes. This section illustrates group action concepts for this case. The action of G on X is called * transitive if for any two x, y in X there exists an g in G such that ; this is not the case * faithful (or effective) if for any two different g, h in G there exists an x in X such that ; this is the case, because, except for the identity, symmetry groups do not contain elements that \\"do nothing\\" * free if for any two different g, h in G and all x in X we have ; this is not the case because there are reflections = Orbits and stabilizers = The orbits of 30 evenly spaced points on a circle under the group action of D3 The orbit of a point x in X is the set of elements of X to which x can be moved by the elements of G. The orbit of x is denoted by Gx: :Gx = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ g\\\\cdot x \\\\mid g \\\\in G \\\\right\\\\\\\\} The orbits are and The points within an orbit are \\"equivalent\\". If a symmetry group applies for a pattern, then within each orbit the color is the same. The set of all orbits of X under the action of G is written as . If Y is a subset of X, we write GY for the set We call the subset Y invariant under G if (which is equivalent to . In that case, G also operates on Y. The subset Y is called fixed under G if for all g in G and all y in Y. The union of e.g. two orbits is invariant under G, but not fixed. For every x in X, we define the stabilizer subgroup of x (also called the isotropy group or little group) as the set of all elements in G that fix x: :G_x = \\\\\\\\{g \\\\in G \\\\mid g\\\\cdot x = x\\\\\\\\} If x is a reflection point , its stabilizer is the group of order two containing the identity and the reflection in x. In other cases the stabilizer is the trivial group. For a fixed x in X, consider the map from G to X given by . The image of this map is the orbit of x and the coimage is the set of all left cosets of Gx. The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural bijection between and Gx. Specifically, the bijection is given by . This result is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem. In the two cases of a small orbit, the stabilizer is non-trivial. If two elements x and y belong to the same orbit, then their stabilizer subgroups, Gx and Gy, are isomorphic. More precisely: if y = g ¬∑ x, then Gy = gGx g‚àí1. In the example this applies e.g. for 5 and 25, both reflection points. Reflection about 25 corresponds to a rotation of 10, reflection about 5, and rotation of ‚àí10. A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is Burnside's lemma: :\\\\leftX/G\\\\right=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\leftG\\\\right}\\\\sum_{g\\\\in G}\\\\leftX^g\\\\right where Xg is the set of points fixed by g. I.e., the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element. For the identity all 30 points are fixed, for the two rotations none, and for the three reflections two each: and Thus, the average is six, the number of orbits.  Representation theory  Up to isomorphism, this group has three irreducible complex unitary representations, which we will call I (the trivial representation), \\\\rho_1 and \\\\rho_2, where the subscript indicates the dimension. By its definition as a permutation group over the set with three elements, the group has a representation on \\\\mathbb{C}^3 by permuting the entries of the vector, the fundamental representation. This representation is not irreducible, as it decomposes as a direct sum of I and \\\\rho_2. I appears as the subspace of vectors of the form (\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda, \\\\lambda), \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} and \\\\rho_2 is the representation on its orthogonal complement, which are vectors of the form (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, -\\\\lambda_1 -\\\\lambda_2). The nontrivial one-dimensional representation \\\\rho_1 arises through the groups \\\\mathbb{Z}_2 grading: The action is multiplication by the sign of the permutation of the group element. Every finite group has such a representation since it is a subgroup of a cyclic group by its regular action. Counting the square dimensions of the representations (1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 6, the order of the group), we see these must be all of the irreducible representations. A 2-dimensional irreducible linear representation yields a 1-dimensional projective representation (i.e., an action on the projective line, an embedding in the M√∂bius group ), as elliptic transforms. This can be represented by matrices with entries 0 and ¬±1 (here written as fractional linear transformations), known as the anharmonic group: * order 1: z * order 2: 1-z, 1/z, z/(z-1) * order 3: (z-1)/z, 1/(1-z) and thus descends to a representation over any field, which is always faithful/injective (since no two terms differ only by only a sign). Over the field with two elements, the projective line has only 3 points, and this is thus the exceptional isomorphism S_3 \\\\approx \\\\mathrm{PGL}(2, 2). In characteristic 3, this embedding stabilizes the point -1 = [-1:1], since 2 = 1/2 = -1 (in characteristic greater than 3 these points are distinct and permuted, and are the orbit of the harmonic cross-ratio). Over the field with three elements, the projective line has 4 elements, and since is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 elements, S4, the resulting embedding \\\\mathrm{S}_3 \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathrm{S}_4 equals the stabilizer of the point -1.

Brown was named a 1973 J. G. Taylor Spink Award winner by the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and was inducted the same year as Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Cool Papa Bell, and umpire Jocko Conlan. Early life Brown was born in Somersville, California, a mining town near San Francisco. His father Patrick was the local saloon keeper. When the Somersville mines flooded, the family moved to San Francisco, where Brown was a firsthand witness to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Brown attended St. Ignatius College (later renamed The University of San Francisco) for his prep school as well as university years. During his college years Brown played baseball for the Sacramento minor league team in the summers. Career After getting his undergraduate degree he began his sportswriting career with the San Francisco Bulletin. After serving in U.S. Army intelligence stateside during World War I, Brown returned to the Bulletin, but soon moved to William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco Call & Post. Brown was one of the first sportswriters to hail a local boxer named Jack Dempsey. He also doubled as the paper's drama critic, specializing in vaudeville and musical comedy. In the early 1920s Brown was transferred to the Hearst paper in New York for a year. That is where he hired a young sportswriter named Ed Sullivan, who went on to be a society columnist and then a mid-century American icon with his TV variety show. Starting in 1920, Brown saw every World Series for fifty years. Brown's final move was to Chicago to be the sports editor of Hearsts Chicago Herald-Examiner. He was a sports editor, columnist and baseball beat writer (usually at the same time) for several Chicago papers over the next 40 years. While working at the Chicago American as sports editor he mentored a young sportswriter named Brent Musburger. Brown was a friend and confidant of legendary University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. Brown and former Notre Dame running back Marchy Schwartz had dinner with Rockne in Chicago the night before his ill- fated plane crash. He wrote Rockne's biography in 1931. Long credited to Grantland Rice, Brown was actually the person that coined the nickname for fabled Illinois running back Red Grange. He wrote a column describing Grange's running style and said he was like a \\"Galloping Ghost.\\" The nickname is one of the most famous in sports annals. Brown also coined the nickname \\"The Sultan of Swat\\" for legendary baseball icon Babe Ruth. As a beat writer and columnist he was known for his acerbic wit and breezy reporting style. Following the 1945 World Series, he wrote a history of the Chicago Cubs as part of the Putnam series of books that covered all the major league baseball teams. Mr. Brown's famous quote from the 1945 World Series between the Cubs and Tigers of \\" I don't think either one of them is good enough to win it\\" usually surfaces as the Cubs reach rare playoff appearances. It was sufficiently well-received that The Chicago Cubs is one book in that series that has been periodically re-issued. In 1947 he wrote a memoir of sorts called Win, Lose or Draw. It was a collection of anecdotes about celebrated figures in sports Brown had crossed paths with in his first 30 years as a sportswriter. Personal life Brown's three sons were all athletes at the University of Notre Dame. Sons Bill and Pete were swimmers while youngest son, Roger, was a backup quarterback for the Fighting Irish on the 1946 and 1947 National Championship teams. Brown also had a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Rempe (n√©e Brown). Warren Brown died at age 84 in Forest Park, Illinois and is buried in Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois next to his beloved wife and best friend, Olive Burns Brown.

The school operates on a seven period day and in some cases offers zero and eighth hour periods before and after school, respectively. The current principal is Mark A. Murrell. The Woodlands College Park is also home to the Conroe ISD Academy of Science and Technology, a science and technology based magnet program. In addition to sections of The Woodlands, it serves portions of Shenandoah.\\"Zoning Map.\\" City of Shenandoah.

Mark Murrell, previously of McCullough Junior High School, became the College Park principal upon the school's opening. The Conroe ISD Academy of Science, previously at Oak Ridge High School, moved to College Park when College Park opened since Oak Ridge High School needed more space for zoned students. The school had grades 9 through 11 in its first year, with grade 12 being established the following year. At first area students were allowed to remain at The Woodlands High School or move on to College Park. Campus The three story school building has of space. There is a main entrance with four pillars and a clock tower on top and separate gymnasium and auditorium entrances. Murrell described the main entrance as having \\"a very Jeffersonian, old-fashioned school look\\". Carissa D. Mire of the Houston Chronicle stated that the clock tower is similar to the one in Back to the Future. Academics The Woodlands College Park High School has achieved high academic ratings since it opened in 2005 including exemplary ratings from the Texas Education Agency. The 2017, U.S. News & World Report listed the high school in the top 100 of all Texas High Schools (including magnet and charter schools) which places it in the top 5% overall. Additionally, the 2017 Texas school rankings from the Children at Risk organization rated the school an A+ and a ranking of 23 out of 187 Houston area high schools and 9 out of 141 when excluding dedicated charter and magnet schools. An average SAT score of 1657 places The Woodlands College Park among the top high schools in the Houston area. These rankings consisted of Harris, Montgomery, Galveston, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Chambers, Waller, and Liberty counties and use criteria of Performance on STAAR reading and math tests, Campus performance to similar schools, Improvement over time on standardized tests, and College Readiness. For each school year, the Texas Education Agency rates school performance using an A‚ÄìF grading system based on statistical data. For 2018‚Äì2019, the school received a score of 92 out of 100, resulting in an A grade. The school received a similar score of 90 the previous year. Athletics College Park's mascot is the Cavalier. College Park Cavaliers competes in football, baseball, basketball (boys and girls), track (boys and girls), soccer (boys and girls), wrestling (boys and girls), softball, tennis (boys and girls), golf (boys and girls), volleyball, and bowling. They once had a hockey team, but the school disbanded it in 2010. Various programs have seen statewide success over the years; College Park's football team went undefeated in the 2007 regular season, and had a state-ranked defense in the 2013 season. The tennis team has been state-ranked multiple times. The boys basketball team were nationally-ranked in 2013 and went to state, but lost to the also nationally-ranked Atascocita High School. The Cavaliers bowling team won state in 2013. Boys soccer was nationally ranked and went to state in 2019, but lost the state championship against soccer powerhouse Lee High School. Perhaps the most consistent team is the women's volleyball team, who went state-ranked in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and were within the top 25 teams nationally in 2011. The first athletic director and football head coach was Coach Richard Carson, formerly of Eisenhower High School, who lead the Cavaliers from their opening season in 2005 until his retirement in 2017. The second and current athletic director and head football coach is Lonnie Madison, formerly a coordinator at Klein Collins High School. The school's hockey team used a rink at Bear Branch Park from 2008 to 2010. Demographics In the 2018‚Äì2019 school year, TWCP had 3,127 students. The ethnic distribution of students was as follows: * 52.3% were White * 26.6% were Hispanic * 9.1% were Asian * 8.1% were Black * 3.1% were Two or More Races * 0.6% were American Indian * 0.3% were Pacific Islander 19.0% of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.

Castle Cove is located 11 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Willoughby. Castle Cove is situated on the western side of Middle Harbour.  History  The Cammeraygal people of the Guringai nation lived in the area until the 1820s and are recorded as being in the northern parts of the Sydney region for approximately 5,800 years.Fact Sheet 2 Castle Cove. Willoughby City Council. May 2013. Retrieved 1 December 2017. It is believed that Castle Cove was named after the estate of Henry Hastings Willis, a prominent member of the Parliament of New South Wales at the time. In 1858 the first grant purchase was made to Dr H. G. Alleyne. By 1878 almost all the land on the peninsula had been sold. In 1886 most of the area had been resold to Andrew Armstrong who formed the Cammeray Estate Land Company, which went into liquidation in 1893. In 1903-04 the Willis family built ‚ÄúInnisfallen Castle‚Äù a grand, castle-like house. They had purchased from Dr Alleyne on a default mortgage and used the land for light farming. In 1958 the Hooker Corporation acquired a controlling interest in Walter Burley Griffin‚Äôs company, The Greater Sydney Development Association, which had owned most of Castlecrag, Middle Harbour and Castle Cove. From 1956 to 1970 Castle Cove was developed by Headland Developments and Hooker-Rex Estates. Around 1985, the descendants of Henry Willis attempted to subdivide the land around the Castle, to be used for construction of several town houses, and turn the Castle into a wedding reception centre. As the land earmarked for the town houses was previously donated to the Castle owners by the government to enhance the Castle grounds, it was felt that profiting from this was inappropriate. As a result, Willoughby Council rejected the rezoning required to build the townhouses. Permission to run a business from the Castle was also rejected. The Castle owners then sold the property for approx $4 million, via an onsite public auction.  Heritage listings  Castle Cove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 14 Cherry Place: Innisfallen Castle and grounds  Population  According to the 2016 census, there were 2,554 residents in Castle Cove. 60.8% of people were born in Australia.

Basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) are tactical movements performed by fighter aircraft during air combat maneuvering (also called ACM, or dogfighting), to gain a positional advantage over the opponent. BFM combines the fundamentals of aerodynamic flight and the geometry of pursuit, with the physics of managing the aircraft's energy-to- weight ratio, called its specific energy. Maneuvers are used to gain a better angular position in relation to the opponent. They can be offensive, to help an attacker get behind an enemy; or defensive, to help the defender evade an attacker's air-to-air weapons. They can also be neutral, where both opponents strive for an offensive position or disengagement maneuvers, to help an escape. Classic maneuvers include the lag pursuit or yo-yo, which add distance when the attacker may overshoot the target due to higher airspeed, the low yo- yo, which does the opposite when the attacker is flying too slow, the scissors, which attempts to drive the attacker in front of the defender, and the defensive spiral, which allows a defender to disengage from an attacker. Situational awareness is often taught as the best tactical defense, removing the possibility of an attacker getting or remaining behind the pilot; even with speed a fighter is open to attack from the rear. Introduction Basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) are actions that a fighter aircraft makes during air combat maneuvering, historically known as dogfighting. The development of BFM began with the first fighter aircraft, during World War I, then continued with each following war, adapting to the changing weapons and technologies. Basic fighter maneuvers consist of many varying tactical turns, rolls, and other actions to get behind or above an enemy, before the opponent can do the same. BFM are typically universal maneuvers which can be performed in almost any fighter aircraft, and are usually considered to be training maneuvers. Training usually begins with pilots flying the same type of aircraft, pitting only their skills against each other. In advanced training, pilots learn to fly against opponents in different types of aircraft, so pilots must learn to cope with different technological advantages as well, which more resembles real combat. In actual air combat maneuvering, variations of these basic maneuvers may become necessary, depending on the different types of aircraft involved, the weapon systems each side is using, and the number of aircraft involved.Shaw, p. xi BFM are used in the three-dimensional arena of air combat, where maneuvers are not limited by simple two-dimensional turns, such as during a car chase. BFM not only relies on an aircraft's turn performance, but also on the pilot's ability to make trade-offs between airspeed (kinetic energy) and altitude (potential energy) to maintain an energy level that will allow the fighter to continue maneuvering efficiently. BFM also relies on the pilot's understanding of the geometry of pursuit within the three-dimensional arena, where different angles of approach can cause different rates of closure. The fighter pilot uses these angles not only to get within a range where weapons can be used, but also to avoid overshooting, which consists either of flying out in front of the opponent, called a \\"wingline overshoot\\", or crossing the enemy's flight path, called a \\"flight path overshoot\\". The fighter pilot with the most advantageous position is usually above or behind the opponent, and is commonly called the attacker. Conversely, the pilot in the disadvantageous position is usually either below or ahead of the opponent, and is referred to as the defender. Most maneuvers are offensive, such as the \\"barrel roll attack\\", \\"high Yo-Yo\\", \\"low Yo-Yo\\", and \\"lag roll\\". Defensive maneuvers more often consist of turning very aggressively to avoid the attacker's guns, with maneuvers like the \\"break\\" and the \\"high Yo-Yo defense\\"; sometimes tightening the turn, sometimes relaxing it, and other times reversing the turn. The defender will usually maneuver to force an overshoot, or to extend the range enough to dive away and escape. However, other \\"last- ditch\\" maneuvers are used by the defender when the attacker achieves a firing solution, or the defender's energy becomes depleted so that maximum turn performance cannot be maintained, such as \\"guns defense\\" or the \\"defensive spiral\\". History Basic fighter maneuver development began during World War I, with maneuvers such as the \\"Immelmann\\", named after German pilot Max Immelmann, the \\"break\\" and the \\"barrel roll\\". The modern Immelmann differs from the original version, which is now called a stall turn or \\"Hammerhead turn\\". The Immelmann turn was an effective maneuver in the early part of the war but as aircraft technology advanced and fighter engines became more powerful, it became a dangerous maneuver, because the opponent could climb and shoot the German fighters when they were almost motionless at the top of the turn.Shaw, p. 154 Billy Bishop, the top Canadian ace of World War I, described a break: > Watching carefully over your shoulder and judging the moment he will open > fire, you turn your machine quickly so as to fly at right angles to him. His > bullets will generally pass behind you during the maneuver.Shaw, p. 25 During World War I, due to the low power of early aircraft, vertical movements were difficult and extended maneuvering led to a loss of energy. Combat tended to degenerate into individual attacks, the classic \\"dogfights\\". One specific maneuver that did emerge was the defensive Lufbery, in which several allied aircraft would fly in a circle so that any attackers trying to position against one of the aircraft would fly directly in front of the aircraft behind them. As engines became more powerful, three-dimensional tactics became available to counter the stalemate of the Lufbery, and by WWII it was no longer effective.U.S. Navy Air Training Command - Air combat maneuvering -- Rolling scissors Development continued through each war, as aircraft and weapon systems became more advanced. Maneuvers such as the \\"combat spread\\" were first devised by pilots like Werner Molders during the Spanish civil war.Budiansky p. 6 A simple, non-turning form of the low-Yo-Yo is depicted in John Godfrey's description of his first kill, flying a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt over Europe during World War II; > Breathlessly I watched the 109 in between the breaks in the clouds as I > dove.

Boyd developed his Energy-Maneuverability theory during the Vietnam War. Even so, as quoted by the U.S Navy Air Training Command, \\"1) The basics of ACM have not changed since the early days of aviation, and 2) A fighter pilot must maintain constant aggressiveness for success. As the [Red] Baron would say, 'All else is rubbish.'\\".U.S. Navy Air Training Command - Air combat maneuvering -- Introduction Training Basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) are used by fighter pilots during a dogfight to gain a positional advantage over an opponent. Pilots must have keen knowledge of not only their own aircraft's performance characteristics, but also of the opponents, taking advantage of their own strengths while exploiting the enemy's weaknesses. Pilots need good eyesight, situation awareness, and the ability to maneuver against an opponent in three dimensions. BFM are generally grouped into two categories: * Primary BFM * Relative BFM Primary maneuvers are those which are performed without respect to an enemy's position. These are often simple maneuvers, such as climbs, turns, aileron rolls, slow rolls, and rudder rolls. Relative maneuvers are performed in relation to the motion of another aircraft. These are often more complex, including energy saving maneuvers, such as the high and low Yo-Yos, and repositioning maneuvers such as displacement rolls.Shaw, p. 62 It is easy to fall into the trap of considering BFM to be a series of set maneuvers providing a foolproof recipe for a dominant position. The reality is that BFM are a series of fluid and often improvised proactive and reactive actions, varying infinitely according to range, altitude, speed, aircraft type, weapons system type and any of an enormous range of other factors. An extremely successful tactic one day may yield unfortunate results if repeated the next day, and pilots often credit luck as a major factor.Shaw, p. x BFM are normally considered to be individual maneuvers, where ACM is applied to the tactics behind dogfighting as a whole.Shaw, pp. x‚Äìxii In military training, BFM are often conducted against an adversary in the same type of aircraft. This allows the pilot to fly against a machine with known performance values and allows aircrew to build their awareness of important concepts such as sight picture, rates of closure and line of sight rates that are cues to being successful in the visual arena. This also allows pilots to build their BFM skills against one another, without either having a particular technological advantage. Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) consists of advanced maneuvers performed by aircraft of two separate types (such as F-16 vs F/A-18). This training is valuable in that both pilots are not as aware of the performance capabilities and characteristics of the other aircraft and, therefore, must rely on the fundamental BFM principles and evaluation/decision making skills to maneuver to an advantageous position versus their opponent. In this type of training, the advantages of one type of fighter may differ greatly from the advantages of the other, so pilots learn to refine their BFM skills to make use of the opponent's weaknesses. Using BFM as the building blocks for multiple aircraft maneuvers, such as the finger four, loose deuce, and Thach weave, pilots learn how to maneuver in situations involving one against one, one against two, two against two, two against many, or even one against many. This type of training, introduced during the last stages of flight school, is more like actual combat, and is the most beneficial for aircrew once basic BFM skills are mastered. Principles =Specific energy= Energy is a primary factor in controlling and maneuvering an aircraft. If an attacker has too much energy, it may be easy to get in range but difficult to prevent an overshoot. Too little energy and the attacker may not be able to get in range at all. If the defender has more energy than the attacker, an escape may be possible, but too little energy and the defender will lose maneuverability. In aviation, the term \\"energy\\" does not refer to the fuel nor the thrust it produces. Instead, thrust is referred to as \\"power\\". Energy is the state of the fighter's mass at any given time, and is the result of the power. Energy comes in two forms, which are kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is a function of the fighter's mass and speed, while potential energy is a function of its mass, gravity and altitude. The combined potential and kinetic energy is called the total energy. Because the energy package is the combination of mass, speed and altitude, a fighter flying at low altitude but a high speed may have the same total energy as a fighter of equal mass, but flying at a low speed and high altitude. One of the inputs to the formula for total energy is the mass of the object, in this case the aircraft. This means that two aircraft flying under identical conditions of speed and altitude will have different energy; the heavier aircraft will have higher energy. However, this does not imply that the heavier aircraft will be more maneuverable, as that mass will require more energy to accelerate. For this reason, a more useful measure is the specific energy, the energy per unit weight. Lighter aircraft generally have higher specific energy for any given operational conditions. Energy state can be changed through the application of power. Heavier aircraft will require more power to change their energy state, so two aircraft with equal energy will not have the same maneuverability. This leads to the concept of \\"specific power\\" in the same fashion as specific energy. For any given operational condition, a selected speed and altitude for instance, any given aircraft will require a certain amount of power simply to maintain those conditions, due largely to the effects of drag. This gives rise to the concept of \\"specific excess power\\", the amount of additional power available to an aircraft over and above the power needed to maintain those flight conditions. Specific excess power is normally expressed for an aircraft flying straight and level. Turning requires an expenditure of energy, both to change the energy state of the aircraft, as well as due to the additional induced drag that is naturally created as a side effect of generating the lift force required to change direction. This implies that an aircraft with higher specific excess power has higher sustained maneuverability performance. This overall concept is known as \\"energy maneuverability\\". Maneuverability is not solely a factor of energy or specific power, many other factors like the efficiency of the wing planform at generating lift, or the load limits of the aircraft, can limit the maneuverability in ways that are not directly related to weight and power. This gives different aircraft very different types of performance under various maneuvers. For instance, an aircraft with high thrust for weight may have high specific excess power but nevertheless suffer from very high induced drag during turns - this was very common on delta wing aircraft for instance \\\\- in which case it will attempt to avoid turns and instead use climbs and dives to its advantage. Such aircraft are referred to as \\"energy fighters\\". Others, typically those with lower wing loading, may have less excess power but nevertheless be able to perform turns without losing as much energy, and are referred to as \\"angles fighters\\" or \\"dog- fighters\\". When two aircraft meet in combat, they may have different energy states and energy retention. Typically, the fighter with higher energy and better retention will make an \\"energy move\\", like a high yo-yo to maintain the energy advantage, while the fighter at an energy disadvantage (angles fighter) will make an \\"angles move\\" such as a break turn, trying to use the opponent's energy to their own advantage. =Energy management= In combat, a pilot is faced with a variety of limiting factors. Some limitations are constant, such as gravity, structural integrity, and thrust-to-weight ratio. Other limitations vary with speed and altitude, such as turn radius, turn rate, and the specific energy of the aircraft. The fighter pilot uses BFM to turn these limitations into tactical advantages.Variable Factors , Flight Training Instruction A faster, heavier aircraft may not be able to evade a more maneuverable aircraft in a turning battle, but can often choose to break off the fight and escape by diving or using its thrust to provide a speed advantage. A lighter, more maneuverable aircraft can not usually choose to escape, but must use its smaller turning radius at higher speeds to evade the attacker's guns, and to try to circle around behind the attacker.Spick BFM are a constant series of trade-offs between these limitations to conserve the specific energy state of the aircraft. Even if there is no great difference between the energy states of combating aircraft, there will be as soon as the attacker accelerates to catch up with the defender. However, potential energy can easily be traded for kinetic energy, so an aircraft with an altitude advantage can easily turn the potential energy into speed. Instead of applying thrust, a pilot may use gravity to provide a sudden increase in speed, by diving, at a cost in the potential energy that was stored in the form of altitude. Similarly, by climbing the pilot can use gravity to provide a decrease in speed, conserving the aircraft's kinetic energy by changing it into altitude. This can help an attacker to prevent an overshoot, while keeping the energy available in case one does occur.Corner Speed , Flight Training Instruction =Turn performance= Both turn rate (degrees per second), and turn radius (diameter of the turn), increase with speed, until the \\"corner speed\\" is reached. Corner speed is defined as the minimum speed at which the maximum sustainable g-force load can be generated (the load at which power equals drag), and varies with the fighter's structural design, wing loading characteristics, weight (including added weight from missiles, drop- tanks, etc...), and thrust capabilities. It often falls in the area of . The maximum sustainable-load the aircraft can generate also varies, but is typically between 3 and 5 g's. At the corner speed, the fighter can attain its maximum turn-rate, flying the craft just at the edge of buffeting (the turbulence preceding a stall). Below this speed, the aircraft will be limited to flying at lower g's, resulting in a decrease in turn rate. If the pilot attempts to \\"pull\\" more g's, the aircraft will buffet and aerodynamically stall. On the other hand, if the fighter is flown above its corner speed it will be able to pull higher g's, but doing so will cause it to lose airspeed from the excess drag created. Turning at the maximum sustainable-load at speeds above the corner speed will result in an increase in turn radius which, respectively, will cause a decrease in turn rate.U.S. Navy Air Training Command - Air combat maneuvering -- Total energy (TE) \\"Instantaneous turn- rate\\" describes turns which are above the maximum sustainable-load. These turns can be as high as 9 g's before the pilot begins to lose consciousness (G-LOC). These turns can have a very small turn radius, but cause a loss in energy, either in the form of speed or altitude. Therefore, these turns are unsustainable, causing the fighter to lose massive amounts of airspeed, sometimes reaching stall speed in as little as a quarter turn. To some degree the energy loss may be compensated for by increasing thrust, known as applying \\"excess specific power\\", but this cannot fully make up for the losses. This usually occurs during hard turns or even harder \\"breaks\\". Only by turning the aircraft at its best \\"sustained turn-rate\\" can the aircraft maintain its specific energy. However, situations in combat may require a change in energy, and energy may also be increased by pulling less than the maximum sustained g-force load. =Pursuit curves= Pursuit curves. Successful BFM requires geometry as much as it does skill and stamina.Shaw, pp. 62‚Äì67 Pilots must know their aircraft's corner speed, as well as optimum angles of bank (AOB) and angles of attack (AOA), without consciously thinking about them. At the same time, pilots must remain conscious of the angle between the opponent's velocity vector and their own, called the track crossing angle (TCA), which is important when aligning or avoiding a firing solution. Most importantly, the pilot must remain aware of the angle off tail (AOT), which is the angle between flight paths.BFM Geometry , Flight Training InstructionT-45 Flight Manual Glossary of TermsACM Analysis A high AOT causes a high rate of closure, but makes achieving a suitable guns solution nearly impossible. Acquiring a low AOT (getting on an enemy's tail), can decrease or even reverse closure rate, and is usually the primary goal before an overshoot occurs. However, an uncooperative defender may try to take advantage of the high closure rate by turning to increase AOT, forcing an overshoot. The AOT is often estimated by the position of the attacking aircraft's nose in relation to the defender. AOT are generally grouped into three categories, called \\"pursuit curves\\". \\"Lead pursuit\\" occurs when the nose of the attacker points ahead of the defender, while \\"pure pursuit\\" happens when the attacker's nose points directly at the defender. If the attacker's nose points behind the defender, the condition is known as \\"lag pursuit\\". Lead pursuit The primary purpose for lead pursuit is to provide closure, even when chasing a faster opponent. The high AOT presented during lead pursuit allows the attacker to quickly decrease the forward, lateral, and vertical separation between aircraft, simply by traveling a shorter path. However, lead pursuit causes the AOT to increase at a rapid rate. This causes the closure rate to increase as well, and, in an attempt to prevent an overshoot, the attacker will have to pull an increasingly tighter turn upon nearing the defender.Figure 9-11 Lead Pursuit , Flight Training Instruction An attacker in lead pursuit is well within the defender's rear view. Unless the defender has enough of a speed advantage to escape by relaxing the turn and dropping into a shallow dive, the defender will likely turn sharply in an effort to increase the AOT, forcing the attacker to turn even harder, to overshoot, or to perform a maneuver out of the horizontal plane to compensate.Shaw, pp. 63‚Äì65 Lead pursuit is used during gun attacks, because the fast motion of combat requires that the aircraft's cannons be aimed at a point in space ahead of the defender, where the enemy will be when the bullets arrive. This is called \\"leading the target\\". Lead pursuit presents the attacker with difficulty in maintaining sight of the opponent, as the nose of the attacking aircraft becomes an obstruction to the pilot's view.Shaw, pp. 7‚Äì10 Pure pursuit Like lead pursuit, pure pursuit is used to provide closure. However, closure is not as rapid, nor is the rate of increase in AOT. This is not as effective against a faster moving opponent, so the attacker may need to accelerate to maintain pure pursuit. Pure pursuit is used when acquiring a missile lock. It both places the attacker further aft of the defender and presents the defender with the smallest amount of surface area to see. This complicates evasive action, since only the front of the attacking aircraft is in view.Shaw, pp. 47‚Äì52,65 Lag pursuit A Japanese A6M3 Zero in cold-side lag pursuit behind a US B-25 Mitchell. Lag pursuit is used to stop or reverse closure rate and to decrease AOT, while allowing the attacker to maintain or increase forward separation (also called nose/tail separation, or nose-to-tail). Following outside the defender's turn radius, the attacker can maintain or increase energy while forcing the defender to turn at an energy depleting rate. \\"Hot side\\" lag occurs when there is a large amount of forward separation between aircraft, showing the top side of the defending fighter. This puts the attacker in the defender's rear view, and the common defense is to tighten the turn. \\"Cold side\\" lag occurs when there is little nose-to-tail separation, leaving the belly of the defending fighter in view. This puts the attacker in the defender's blind spot, and the common defense is to reverse the turn. Unless the defender is markedly more maneuverable, and lateral separation is just right, lag pursuit can not be maintained for long, causing the AOT to decrease until a suitable firing solution is presented.Shaw, pp. 65‚Äì67 =Out-of-plane maneuvers= Maneuvering planes, showing oblique and vertical turns. Maneuvers are rarely performed in the strictly vertical or horizontal planes. Most turns contain some degree of \\"pitch\\" or \\"slice\\". During a turn in an oblique plane, a pitch turn occurs when the aircraft's nose points above the horizon, causing an increase in altitude. A slice turn happens when the nose points below the horizon, causing a decrease in altitude. The purpose is not only to make the aircraft harder for an enemy to track, but also to increase or decrease speed while maintaining energy.Figure 9-3 Horizontal Maneuvering , Flight Training Instruction An out-of-plane maneuver enhances this effect, by diverting the fighter into a new plane of travel. Increasing the pitch or slice can quickly provide a change in speed, which can just as quickly be reversed by returning to the original plane of travel. Out-of-plane maneuvers are not only used to provide a reduction in turn radius, but also causes the fighter to fly a longer path in relation to the direction of travel. A maneuver such as a high Yo-Yo is used to slow closure and to bring the fighter into lag pursuit, while a low Yo-Yo is used to increase closure and to bring the fighter into lead pursuit.Figure 10-14 Perch Position , Flight Training Instruction During an out-of-plane maneuver, the attacker's nose no longer points at the defender. Instead, the aircraft is rolled until its lift vector (an imaginary line running vertically from the center of the aircraft, perpendicular to its wings), is aligned either ahead of, directly at, or behind the defender, using roll rate instead of turn rate to set the proper pursuit curve. The aircraft's velocity vector (an imaginary line in the direction of motion) will be pulled in the direction of the lift vector.Shaw, pp. 87 Displacement rolls Typical displacement roll A useful type of out-of-plane maneuver employed to decrease AOT are various barrel rolls called displacement rolls, in order to shift the aircraft laterally from its projected flight path onto a new flight path. By controlling the roll rate the pilot can control the degree of displacement.Figure 10-16 Low Yo Yo , Flight Training Instruction An attacker following a more maneuverable opponent may become stuck in lag pursuit (outside the defender's turn radius), unable to achieve a firing solution. By displacing the turn, the two aircraft's flight paths will eventually cross. The AOT will then decrease until the nose of the attacker's aircraft points momentarily at the defender, and then ahead of the defender.Shaw, pp. 67‚Äì71 A displacement roll is a good tactic when ever a reduction in turn radius is needed, but a decrease in turn rate is allowed. =Positioning= There are three basic situations in air combat maneuvering requiring BFM to convert to a favorable result, which are neutral, offensive, and defensive. Most relative maneuvers can be grouped into one of these three categories. Neutral Neutral positions generally occur when both opponents spot each other at the same time. Neither the pilot nor the opponent have the advantage of surprise. Neither has the ability to point the nose of their aircraft at the opponent with sufficient range to employ forward firing ordnance (missiles/guns) prior to the opponent presenting a threat of a similar manner. Each is focused on converting to an offensive situation while forcing their opponent into a defensive.Spick, p. 146 Offensive An offensive position generally occurs when the pilot gets sight of the opponent first. With the advantage of surprise, the pilot can maneuver into a better position to attack the opponent, making it more difficult for the enemy to evade the attack. Common tactics include increasing altitude and attempting to place the fighter directly between the sun and the opponent. This helps put the pilot in a dominant position, primarily concerned with prosecuting their advantage for a kill. An offensive position is generally defined as the ability to get above or behind the enemy. The pilot is able to create an energy advantage, providing the ability to swoop down on the opponent and spray the area with bullets while using the speed to climb back to a safe altitude. The attacker also has an orientation-related advantage, being able to press the attack while avoiding the enemy's weapons.Shaw, pp. 147‚Äì150 Defensive A defensive position usually occurs when the pilot spots the attacker late. Usually below or ahead of the opponent, the pilot is in a weak position, primarily concerned with denying a shot to the opponent and converting to a neutral position. The secondary goal is either to escape or to achieve a dominant position. If the attacker is at an energy disadvantage, the defender will likely use the speed to disengage, but, if the attacker is moving much faster, the defender will usually maneuver in order to force a dangerous overshoot. A dangerous overshoot happens when an attacker flies out in front of the defender, causing their roles to be reversed. Concepts Turn circle geometry. Even though depicted as flying at the same turn rate and turn radius, closure occurs during lead pursuit and then reverses during lag pursuit, with the greatest nose/tail separation at the moment the attacker pulls lead. Once an attacker gets behind a defender, there are three problems to solve in order to prosecute the kill. The attacker must be able to get into the same geometric plane as the defender, get in range without overshooting, and be able to lead the target. The defender will usually turn aggressively to spoil the attacker's solution. =Turn circle= Aircraft turn in circular motions, following a circumference around a central point. The circumference is often referred to as the \\"bubble\\", while the central point is often called the \\"post\\". Any change in the g-force load on the aircraft causes a change in the bubble's size as well as a change in turn radius, moving the post in relation to the fighter. Because an aircraft turning at its maximum load cannot turn any tighter, any aircraft located between such a fighter and its post is momentarily safe from attack. It is in this area where an attacking fighter will usually try to position itself.Figure 9-15 Turn Circle , Flight Training Instruction Once inside the defender's bubble, the attacker will be in lead pursuit and may have an opportunity for a lucky \\"snapshot\\" hit. If the attacker can maneuver onto the defender's flight path before an overshoot occurs, the attacker will be able to stop or reverse closure rate. The most desirable position is, following the defender's flight path, a distance equal to one turn radius behind the opponent. This position, from which the attacker will be able to safely maintain command of the fight, is termed the \\"control point\\". The control point lies in the heart of an imaginary, cone-shaped area, called the \\"control zone\\", and it is within this zone that the attacker will have both sufficient time and range to react to the defender's countermeasures.Figure 9-17 Post-Bubble , Flight Training Instruction =Overshoots= During a dogfight, the term \\"overshoot\\" refers to situations in which the attacker either crosses the enemy's flight path or passes the defender, ending up in front. Passing the defender is referred to as a \\"wingline overshoot\\". Also called a \\"3-9 line overshoot\\" or a \\"dangerous overshoot\\", this occurs when an attacking aircraft approaches too fast and accidentally crosses the defender's wingline (an imaginary line passing through the center of the aircraft at the 3 o-clock and 9 o-clock positions). A wingline overshoot is usually referred to as \\"flying out in front\\" and causes \\"role reversal\\", putting the attacker in range of the defender's weapons, and the attacker suddenly becomes the defender.Basic Principles of BFM When the attacker crosses the defender's flight path, the situation is called a \\"flight path overshoot\\". This happens when an attacker fails to control closure and crosses the defender's flight path from behind. Although not necessarily dangerous, it is possible for a flight path overshoot to cause the attacker to fly out in front of the defender. More often, however, it greatly reduces the attacker's angular advantage over the defender. Flight path overshoots are divided into two categories, called \\"control-zone overshoots\\" and \\"in-close overshoots\\". A \\"control-zone overshoot\\" occurs when the attacker crosses the defender's flight path from behind the front edge of the control zone. After a control-zone overshoot, the defender will continue turning in the same direction to retain the acquired angular advantage, trying to prevent the attacker from getting a good aim. An '\\"in-close overshoot\\" happens when the attacker overshoots the defender's flight path ahead of the control zone. This gives the defender the opportunity to reverse the turn and possibly to cause a wingline overshoot, allowing the defender to move in behind the attacker and reverse their roles.Fighter combat: tactics and maneuvering By Robert L. Shaw - United States Naval Institute 1985 Page 67 =Circle flow= Circle flowAircraft can turn either towards or away from each other. How the opponent turns in relation to the other determines the flow of the fight. If two fighters meet head-on, they will usually make a very close, neutral pass, called a \\"merge\\". After the pass, both fighters may turn to engage. If the two fighters turn in the same direction (i.e.: both turn to the north), they will be traveling toward each other along the same turn circle. This type of engagement is known as \\"one-circle flow\\". If the aircraft turn in opposite directions (i.e.: one turns north but the other turns south), they will move away from each other, flying around to engage each other on separate turn circles. This is called \\"two-circle flow\\".Figure 10-21 One Circle Flow, Flight Training Instruction One-circle flow will result in another merge, unless an angular advantage can be obtained. During one-circle flow, the fighter with the smaller turn radius will have the advantage. Pilots will often pitch-up out-of-plane while increasing thrust, to help minimize turn radius. Because it does not really matter where the two fighters meet in the circle, turn rate is of little importance during one circle flow. Therefore, it is often called a radius fight. An out-of-plane maneuver, such as a displacement roll, is a viable option for reducing turn radius. Two- circle flow will also result in another merge. In two-circle flow, turn radius is of little importance, because what matters is which fighter can get back to the merging place first. Two-circle flow is a turn rate fight, and the angular advantage usually goes to the aircraft with the higher turn rate at its corner speed. Pilots will often slice turn in order to maximize their turn rate. A third option is called vertical flow, in which one or both fighters turn toward the vertical plane. If both fighters go up or down, the fight becomes one-circle flow. If one fighter goes up or down, while the other turns horizontally, it is really a modified version of one-circle flow. However, if one fighter goes up while the other goes down, it becomes two-circle flow.U.S. Navy Air Training Command - Air combat maneuvering -- Engagements In both types of flow, the closest possible merge is desirable to keep the enemy at an angular disadvantage. Although circle flow is often described using neutral merges, the concept applies anytime two aircraft maneuver in relation to each other and the horizon. For instance, the \\"flat scissors\\" is an example of one- circle flow, while the \\"rolling scissors\\" is an example of two-circle flow.Figure 10-22 One Circle = Radius Fight, Flight Training Instruction Maneuvers =Combat spread= The combat spread is the most basic of maneuvers used prior to engagement. A pair of attacking aircraft will separate, often by a distance of one mile horizontal by 1500 feet vertical. The fighter with the lower altitude becomes the defender, while the wingman flies above in \\"the perch\\" position. The defender will then attempt to lure their opponents into a good position to be attacked by the wingman.Figure 10-2 Combat Spread, Flight Training Instruction =Defensive split= A pair of fighters encountering one or two attackers will often use a defensive split. The maneuver consists of both defenders making turns in opposite directions, forcing the attackers to follow only one aircraft. This allows the other defender to circle around, and maneuver behind the attackers. =Sandwich= A sandwich maneuver begins with two defenders flying line-abreast (side by side at the same altitude), with typically about a mile of lateral separation. When an attacker maneuvers onto the tail of one aircraft, the defender will make a sharp turn away from the wingman. At the same time, the wingman turns in the same direction as the defender. When both fighters turn 90 degrees, they will come into single-file alignment with each other, \\"sandwiching\\" the attacker in the middle. Because the attacker is distracted chasing the defender, this allows the wingman to maneuver onto the attacker's tail for an easy shot. =Break= Spotting an attacker approaching from behind, the defender will usually break. The maneuver consists of turning sharply across the attacker's flight path, to increase AOT (angle off tail). The defender is exposed to the attacker's guns for only a brief instant (snapshot). The maneuver works well because the slower moving defender has a smaller turn radius and bigger angular velocity, and a target with a high crossing speed (where the bearing to the target is changing rapidly) is very difficult to shoot. This can also help to force the attacker to overshoot, which may not be true had the turn been made away from the attacker's flight path. =Barrel roll attack= Barrel roll attack The counter to a break is often a displacement roll called a barrel roll attack. A barrel roll consists of performing a roll and a loop, completing both at the same time. The result is a helical roll around a straight flight path. The barrel roll attack uses a much tighter loop than the roll, completing a full loop while only executing 3/4 of a roll. The result is a virtual 90 degree turn, using all three dimensions, in the direction opposite of the roll. Rolling away from the defender's break, the attacker completes the roll with the aircraft's nose pointed in the direction of the defender's travel. =High-side guns pass= If the attacker has a significant altitude advantage, a high-side guns pass is usually prudent. Sometimes called a \\"swoop\\", \\"boom and zoom\\", \\"hit and split\\", plus a variety of other names, it consists of a powered dive toward the rear quarter of a lower flying opponent. Shooting with the cannons in a single, high-speed pass, the attacker uses excess kinetic energy to disengage from the fight in a zoom climb back to a safe altitude, restoring the potential energy. This allows the attacker to set up another attack and dive again. Surprise is often a key element in this type of attack, and the attackers will often hide in the sun or clouds, stalking their opponents until a good opportunity is presented. A high-side guns pass is a very effective tactic against a more maneuverable opponent, where the turning battle of a dogfight is best avoided.Shaw, p. 294 =Immelmann= Schematic view of an Immelmann turn: An Immelmann trades airspeed for altitude during a 180 degree change in direction. The aircraft performs the first half of a loop, and when completely inverted, rolls to the upright position. The Immelmann is a good offensive maneuver for setting up a high-side guns pass against a lower altitude, slow moving opponent, going in an opposite direction. However, an Immelmann is a poor defensive maneuver, turning the defender into a slow moving target.Sick's ACM School: Maneuvers Explained . 352ndfightergroup.com. Retrieved on 2010-10-23. =Split-S= Schematic view of a Split S: The opposite of an Immelmann is the Split-S. This maneuver consists of rolling inverted and pulling back on the stick, diving the aircraft into a half loop, which changes the aircraft's direction 180 degrees. The split-s is rarely a viable option in combat as it depletes kinetic energy in a turn and potential energy in a dive. It is most often used to set up a high-side guns pass against a lower but fast moving opponent that is traveling in the opposite direction. Also, the split-s is sometimes used as a disengagement tactic. =Pitchback= Chandelle from the FAA Publication FAA-H-8083-3A (Airplane Flying Handbook) A pitchback, also called a Chandelle, is an Immelmann that is executed in some plane other than the vertical. Basically just a pitch turn, the fighter will be at some angle of bank before performing the half loop and roll. Unlike the Immelmann, a pitchback depletes less kinetic energy and is harder for an adversary to track. =Wingover= Diagram of a basic wingover A wingover is a maneuver used to provide a fast, 180 degree turn with a very small turn radius. It consists of a quarter loop into a vertical climb, letting the speed fall as altitude increases, and then a flat-turn over the top, diving to complete a quarter loop at the original altitude, but going in the opposite direction. The wingover is similar to a stall turn, but the fighter does not actually stall, which makes the wingover more difficult for an enemy to track. Unlike an Immelmann or a split-s, the wingover also manages energy by conserving both airspeed and altitude.Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-21 Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions By Nato -- 2008 Page 120 --121Douglas A-1H Skyraider Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions By United States Navy 2008 4-16 =Low Yo-Yo= Low Yo-Yo. The low Yo-Yo is one of the most useful maneuvers, which sacrifices altitude for an instantaneous increase in speed. This maneuver is accomplished by rolling with the nose low into the turn, and dropping into a steeper slice turn. By utilizing some energy that was stored in the vertical plane, the attacker can quickly decrease range and improve the angle of the attack, literally cutting the corner on the opponent's turn. The pilot then pulls back on the stick, climbing back to the defender's height. This helps slow the aircraft and prevents an overshoot, while placing the energy back into altitude. A defender spotting this maneuver may try to take advantage of the increase in AOT by tightening the turn in order to force an overshoot. The low Yo-Yo is often followed by a high Yo-Yo, to help prevent an overshoot, or several small low Yo-Yos can be used instead of one large maneuver.Shaw, p. 73 =High Yo-Yo= High Yo-Yo The high Yo-Yo is a very effective maneuver, and very difficult to counter. The maneuver is used to slow the approach of a fast moving attacker while conserving the airspeed energy. The maneuver is performed by reducing the angle at which the aircraft is banking during a turn, and pulling back on the stick, bringing the fighter up into a new plane of travel. The attacker then rolls into a steeper pitch turn, climbing above the defender. The trade-off between airspeed and altitude provides the fighter with a burst of increased maneuverability. This allows the attacker to make a smaller turn, correcting an overshoot, and to pull in behind the defender. Then, by returning to the defenders plane, the attacker restores the lost speed while maintaining energy.Shaw, pp. 71‚Äì73,294 =Lag displacement roll= Lag roll A lag displacement roll, also called a \\"lag roll\\", is a maneuver used to reduce the angle off tail by bringing the attacker from lead pursuit to pure, or even lag pursuit. The maneuver is performed by rolling up and away from the turn, then, when the aircraft's lift vector is aligned with the defender, pulling back on the stick, bringing the fighter back into the turn. This maneuver helps prevent an overshoot caused by the high AOT of lead pursuit, and can also be used to increase the distance between aircraft. =High Yo-Yo defense= To prevent an overshoot, an attacker in lead pursuit may need to correct with an out-of-plane maneuver. If the lateral separation is excessively high, the attacker will probably use a displacement roll. However, if the lateral separation is low enough, the attacker will likely use a high Yo-Yo. The high Yo-Yo defense can be a good tactic in these situations. The maneuver is performed when the attacker rolls away from the turn to begin the correction. The defender will begin to relax the turn by easing off of the stick, called \\"unloading\\", which causes both turn radius and speed to increase, restoring the fighter's lost energy. If the defender maintains the same angle of bank, the subtle maneuver will be very difficult for the attacker to spot. When the attacker completes the out-of- plane maneuver, the defending fighter has regained some of its energy. This allows the defender to, once again, turn harder into the attack, regaining an angular advantage over the higher energy attacker. If the attacker is surprised by the maneuver, a high Yo-Yo defense might even cause an overshoot.High Yo Yo Defense, Flight Training InstructionShaw, p. 137 =Unloaded extension= An unloaded extension is a disengagement (bug out) maneuver often used by the pilot whenever there is enough energy and separation. The maneuver consists of slipping into a steep, straight dive and applying full thrust. Removing all g-force load from the aircraft causes it to accelerate at a very high rate, allowing the pilot to vastly increase range, or \\"extend\\", and possibly to escape. If a defender breaks suddenly, causing the attacker to overshoot, the defender may reverse the turn and move in behind the attacker. An unloaded extension is usually the attacker's best option, using the energy advantage to escape the slower moving defender. An unloaded extension is usually not recommended against a higher energy opponent. However, in many circumstances, such as when an attacker performs a high Yo-Yo too steeply, an unloaded extension is a viable option for the defender.Shaw, pp. 134,185 =Scissors= The scissors are a series of turn reversals and flight path overshoots intended to slow the relative forward motion (downrange travel) of the aircraft in an attempt to either force a dangerous overshoot, on the part of the defender, or prevent a dangerous overshoot on the attacker's part. The defender's goal is to stay out of phase with the attacker, trying to prevent a guns solution, while the attacker tries to get in phase with the defender. The advantage usually goes to the more maneuverable aircraft. There are two types of scissor maneuvers, called flat scissors and rolling scissors.Scissors Maneuvering , Flight Training Instruction Flat scissors Flat scissors Flat scissors, also called horizontal scissors, usually occur after a low-speed overshoot in a horizontal direction. The defender reverses the turn, attempting to force the attacker to fly out in front and to spoil aim. The attacker then reverses, trying to remain behind the defender, and the two aircraft begin a weaving flight pattern.Figure 10-18 Flat Scissors, Flight Training Instruction Rolling scissors Rolling scissors Rolling scissors, also called vertical scissors, tend to happen after a high-speed overshoot from above. The defender reverses into a vertical climb and into a barrel roll over the top, forcing the attacker to attempt to follow. The advantage lies in the aircraft that can pull its nose through the top or bottom of the turn faster. In battles with aircraft that have a thrust-to-weight ratio of less than one the aircraft will quickly lose altitude, and crashing into the ground becomes a possibility.Chapter 10 According to author Mike Spick, \\"Disengagement from a vertical rolling scissors is best made with a split-s and a lot of hope.\\"Spick, p. 147 =Guns defense= Guns defense maneuvering, or \\"guns-D\\", is the last resort for a defender that fails to outmaneuver the attacker. Guns-D is a series of random changes in the defenders flight path, intended to spoil the attacker's aim by presenting a constantly shifting target, and, hopefully, to maneuver out of the bullet stream (hose). It consists of arbitrary speed changes, yaws, skids, slips, pitch-ups, and rolls, and is often referred to as \\"jinking\\". Because the attacker must aim ahead of the opponent, the primary goal in guns-D is to disorient the attacker's aim by keeping the nose pointed in a different direction than the velocity vector (the direction of travel), and is very effective at preventing the attacker from achieving a suitable guns solution. However, guns-D maneuvering still leaves the defender susceptible to stray bullets and \\"lucky shot\\" hits, and does little to improve the relative positional situation. Thus, it is only employed as a last-ditch defensive effort when nothing else works.Valid Attack To Guns-D, Flight Training Instruction =High-g barrel roll= A high g barrel roll can be performed over-the-top or underneath. A high-g barrel roll is a combination of a loop and a snap roll. A high g barrel roll is a last- ditch defensive maneuver, performed when the attacker has achieved a suitable guns solution, in order to cause an overshoot. The high-g barrel roll is a violent maneuver which is performed much more aggressively than a normal barrel roll. Range is critical to the success of the roll, and the defender will usually turn very hard, or employ other measures to draw the opponent very close before performing the roll. The roll is executed by applying hard back-stick pressure, creating the high g-forces, and adding hard rudder input to assist the ailerons in rolling the fighter. A high-g barrel roll can be performed \\"over-the-top\\", or it can be performed \\"underneath\\", which is accomplished by rolling upside-down and beginning the maneuver from the inverted position. The high-g barrel roll is an energy-depleting maneuver that rarely causes the attacker to fly out in front, but usually will result in a flight path overshoot, a flat scissors, or, at the very least, will temporarily disrupt the attacker's aim. =Defensive spiral= Defensive spiral A defender that fails to outmaneuver the attacker can quickly become \\"out of airspeed and ideas\\". The defensive spiral is a maneuver used by the defender when the kinetic energy becomes depleted and other last-ditch maneuvers can not successfully be implemented. The maneuver consists of dropping the nose low during the turn and going into a spiral dive, using gravity to supply the energy needed to continue evasive action. The defensive spiral becomes a rolling scissors performed straight down. The defender's goal is to stay out of phase with the attacker until the ground is dangerously close. The advantage usually goes to the aircraft that can decelerate quicker, and the defender will often cut the power and extend the speedbrakes in an effort to force an overshoot. If this attempt is unsuccessful, the defender will usually pull out of the dive at the last possible second, hoping to cause the attacker to crash into the ground.

The Act of Peter is a brief miracle text celebrating virginity that is found in the 5th-century papyrus Berlin Codex (Berolinensis Gnosticus 8502). It treats of the crippled virgin daughter of Peter, who was accused by the crowd that gathered before his door, among whom he had caused many blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the lame to walk: \\"But your virgin daughter, who has grown up to be beautiful and who has believed in the name of God, why have you not helped her? For behold, one side of her is completely paralyzed and she lies crippled there in the corner.\\" Peter bids the girl rise and walk, and she does, and the crowd rejoices. \\"Then Peter said to his daughter, 'Go to your place, sit down, and become an invalid again.'\\" The crowd weeps. Peter then relates the vision he received when the girl was born, that she would wound many with her beauty. \\"\\"When the girl became ten years old, many were tempted by her. And a man rich in property, Ptolemy, after he had seen the girl bathing with her mother, sent for her so that he might take her for his wife.\\" A section is missing, and when the text resumes, Ptolemy's servants are putting her down before the house, and depart. Finding her \\"with one whole side of her body, from her toes to her head, paralyzed and withered, we picked her up, praising the Lord who had saved his servant from defilement, [and] pollution.\\" The contrite Ptolemy receives a vision, saying \\"Ptolemy, God did not give his vessels for corruption and pollution. But it was necessary for you, since you believed in me, that you not defile my virgin, whom you should have recognized as your sister, since I have become one Spirit for you both.\\" This is the one Gnostic detail of the text, which is in every other way a conventional miracle tale. Ptolemy leaves a plot of land to the girl, \\"since because of her he believed in God and was saved\\", and Peter sells it and distributes the price to the poor. Only nominally connected with the Peter of the New Testament, this brief Act expresses in a characteristically extreme form the cult of virginity in the male-dominated 5th-century Christian Church, a cultural thread that may also be detected in many early Acta of female martyrs.

The I is uniformly black and has short legs and a low-hanging belly, from which the name derives. The I is reared for meat. It is slow-growing, but the meat has good flavour. The I was depicted in the traditional ƒê√¥ng H·ªì paintings of B·∫Øc Ninh province as a symbol of happiness, satiety and wealth.  History  The I is a traditional Vietnamese breed. It is thought to have originated in Nam ƒê·ªãnh province of Vietnam, in the Red River Delta. It was the dominant local pig breed in most provinces of the delta, and was widely distributed in Nam ƒê·ªãnh province and the neighbouring provinces of H√† Nam, Ninh B√¨nh and Th√°i B√¨nh, as well as in the province of Thanh H√≥a immediately to the south, in the North Central Coast region. Until the 1970s the I was probably the most numerous pig breed in northern Vietnam, with numbers running into millions. From that time, the more productive M√≥ng C√°i began to supplant it. The National Institute of Animal Husbandry of Vietnam started a conservation programme, with subsidies for farmers who reared purebred stock, but this had little benefit ‚Äì there was some increase in numbers, but at the cost of increased inbreeding. In 1991, the total population of the I was estimated at , and by 2010 the estimated number was 120. In 2003 the National Institute of Animal Husbandry listed its conservation status as \\"critical\\"; in 2007 the FAO listed it as \\"endangered\\". Small numbers of I pigs were exported in the 1960s to Canada and Sweden, to be kept in zoos or to be used for laboratory experiments. Within a decade, the I had spread to animal parks in other countries in Europe; a few were reared on smallholdings. The I entered the United States from Canada in the mid-1980s, and by the end of the decade the \\"pot-bellied pig\\" was being marketed as a pet. Not all of these were purebred, and some grew to considerable size; the fad was short-lived. It was declared an invasive species in Spain: release of the Vietnamese pot-bellied into the wild, possession, transport and commerce of the breed are forbidden.  Characteristics  The I is a small pig, with an average weight of approximately , and an average height of about It is uniformly black, with heavily wrinkled skin. It has a pronounced sway back and a large sagging belly, which in pregnant sows may drag on the ground. The head is small, with an up-turned snout, small ears and eyes, and heavy sagging jowls. The I is robust and has good resistance to disease and to parasites. It is usually raised extensively, and forages well on the rice straw and water plants of its native area. It is particularly well adapted to the marshy and muddy terrain on which it usually lives: it has plantigrade feet, with weight borne on all four toes of each foot. Two principal types are recognised within the breed: the I-mo or Fatty I is the typical small short-legged pig, with small upward- pointing ears and a short snout; the I-pha or Large I is taller, has longer legs and a longer snout, with bigger ears held horizontally.

His 1984 work, Biology of Knowledge: The evolutionary basis of reason examined cognitive abilities and the increasing complexity of biological diversification over the immense periods of evolutionary time. Riedl built upon the work of the Viennese school of thought initially typified by Konrad Lorenz, and continued in Vienna by Gerhard Vollmer, Franz Wuketits, and in Spain by Nicanor Ursura. Riedl was skeptical of German idealism, and nourished by the tradition that produced the scientists and philosophers of science Ernst Mach, Ludwig Boltzmann, Erwin Schr√∂dinger, Karl Popper, Hans Reichenbach and Sigmund Freud. Lorenz believed that the Kantian framework of cognitive concepts such as three-dimensional space and time were not fixed but built up over phylogenetic history, potentially subject to further developments. Lorenz‚Äôs position, as expanded by Riedl, attempted to make it easier to assimilate non-common sense areas of physics such as quantum field theory and string theory. Riedl drew clear distinctions between the deductive and inductive (non conscious) cognitive processes characteristic of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. His analysis of what he called \\"the pitfalls of reason\\" deserves special attention. He, like Lorenz, was concerned with cognitive processes that might endanger the future of civilization. Riedl had less direct influence on academic philosophy than his profound influence on the thinking of investigators in neuroscience such as Michael Gazzaniga, Antonio Damasio, and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, whose investigations combine synergistically with those of more physiologically-oriented scientists such as Eric Kandel and Rodolfo Llin√°s, as well as computational models that take advantage of the techniques of systems dynamics as practiced by the physiologists Denis Noble and P. Read Montague. Riedl contributed to developmental biology, morphology, evolution (a systems approach) and evolutionary epistemology. He was the Founder President of the Club of Vienna. Evolutionary views Riedl held the opinion that the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century had ignored the role of development and morphology in evolution. He argued that the modern synthesis had failed to explain the origin of body plans and patterns at the macroevolutionary level. He presented his evolutionary theory in Order in Living Organisms: A Systems Analysis of Evolution (translated, 1978). He called for an extended evolutionary synthesis to integrate processes from developmental biology and macroevolutionary perspectives. Riedl and Michael Conrad in the 1970s were the first two scientists to propose explicit mechanisms for the evolution of evolvability.

The density of the ice increases as air bubbles are forced out, strengthening the resultant ice surface so that aircraft landings using wheels instead of skis can be supported. Such runways simplify the transfer of materials to research stations, since wheeled aircraft can carry much heavier loads than ski-equipped aircraft. Blue ice runways are created as a way of streamlining transport to the interior. Without them, most heavy materials must be brought by ship, then ferried inland by ski-equipped smaller aircraft. Large, wheeled aircraft can fly directly into the interior, saving time and money. In particular, they allow for rare medical evacuations to take place year round. The United States Antarctic Program uses them to support its substantial science activities. Because of ice's low coefficient of friction, planes tend to decelerate with reverse thrust, as opposed to traditional means of braking the wheels, and so runways are often several miles long.

It lives in the deserts of Central Asia, averaging under at birth and and during adulthood. Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are eyebrow-like white spots and the lack of any dorsal stripe (found on the other members of the genus Phodopus). The average lifespan for the Roborovski hamster is 2-3 years, though this is dependent on living conditions (extremes being four years in captivity and two in the wild). Roborovskis are known for their speed and have been said to run up to 6 miles a night. https://animals.mom.me/hamsters-run-much-2118.html Distribution and habitat Roborovski hamsters are found in desert regions, such as the basin of the lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan and regions of Tuva, Mongolia and Xinjiang in China. The hamsters inhabit areas of loose sand and sparse vegetation and are rarely found in areas of dense vegetation and solid clay substrates. They live at elevations of around - and although research has been carried out, no fossil record exists for this species. Their efficient use of water makes them particularly suited to the steppe and desert regions they inhabit. They dig and live in burrows with steep tunnels as deep as six feet underground. In the wild, Roborovski hamsters are crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk. The Roborovski hamster has been found to be more common in the southern area of its distribution range, in areas such as Yulin, Shaanxi, China. It has been reported as a common sighting by locals in this city and in the sand dunes of the Ordos desert. = Diet = They are omnivorous; they primarily eat grains, vegetables, fruit, and plants, but they will also eat meat and insects in small quantities. Roborovski hamsters remain underground in winter and survive in that season by stockpiling some food in warmer weather and storing it in special food chambers within their burrow system. The Roborovski hamster mainly feeds on seeds. In Tuva it primarily lives on the seed of the sand alyssum, Nitre Bush, Siberian peashrub, Dracocephalum peregrinum, and milkvetch as well as sedges during the summer- months. Vegetative plant parts are not of significance. In the Chinese province of Shaanxi it is known for foraging millet seeds.Allen, 1940; Thomas, 1908. Cited in: Ross, 1994 (\\"Ecology\\" p. 3). In Mongolia, insects like beetles, earwigs and crickets are part of its diet. According to Formosow the stock of several burrows indicate an almost insect-based diet. cited in: Ross, 1994 (\\"Ecology\\" p. 3). Also the consumption of snails has been reported. cited in: Ross, 1994 (\\"Ecology\\" p. 3). In Tuva, the share of animal food is marginal. Flint and Golowkin determined in 1958 and 1959 that nearly 100 percent of the cheek pouches' content consisted of plant food, whereas animal food was only found in 23 percent of the hamsters' pouches at all in 1958 and 32 percent in 1959.Flint und Golowkin, 1961. cited in: Flint, 1966 (\\"Diet\\" p. 36). The daily dietary intake of the Roborovski hamsters heavily depends on its body weight. Juveniles have higher intakes of food compared to their weight than adult hamsters. Based on its population structure, Wan et al. calculated an average food intake of ca. two gram plant seeds per day. They specify the functional relation between the daily food intake (N) and the body-weight (M) to be N = (1{,}422 \\\\cdot \\\\ln (M / \\\\text{gram}) - 1{,}780) \\\\text{ gram} Pups, juveniles as well as adult hamsters are foraging food in their burrows. cited in: Ross, 1994 (\\"Ecology\\" p. 3) History of human contact Russian expeditioner Lt. Vsevolod Roborovski first made note of these hamsters, discovering them on an expedition in July 1894, though they were not studied scientifically for the best part of another decade, until Konstantin A. Satunin made observations in 1903.DwarfHamsters- Judith Lissenberg p.22-23 The London Zoo imported them into the UK in the 1960s, but the first Roborovski hamsters studied in Britain were imported in the 1970s from Moscow Zoo. (None of them, however, bore offspring.)Konijnen en Knaagdieren Encyclopedie - Esther Verhoeff-Verhallen p.130-131Petwebsite.com Continental European countries had more success in breeding some Roborovskis, however, and those currently in the UK are descendants of a batch imported from the Netherlands in 1990. They were imported to the US in 1998,Website specifically about Roborovski hamsters though they are now commonly found in pet shops in several countries. In South Korea, they are almost as common as the winter-white Russian dwarf hamster. Variation The Roborovski hamster is distinguished from the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) due to its smaller size, sandy coloration of fur and its lack of a dorsal stripe. When observed from behind, the neurocranium is rounded and does not appear to be as rectangular as Phodopus campbelli and Phodopus sungorus. The cusps of the lower molars are directly opposite and not alternate, as seen in other members of the genus, and the incisive foramen of the Roborovski hamster is greater than in length and is shorter than the length of the upper tooth row, which is uncharacteristic of the other two members of the genus. Currently, 10 variations of Roborovski hamsters are thought to exist.Oak Farm RoborovskisMy New Robos - 'Head Spot' and 'Pure White' Only one is standardised in the UK as of 2018 as per UK National Hamster Council with 4 genes recognised and others still under dispute. *agouti -- a natural grayish-brown with white underside and \\"eyebrows\\" (white over eyes) *\\"white face\\" -- a dominant mutation producing an agouti-coloured hamster with a white face *\\"husky\\" -- a recessive mutation producing a white-faced hamster with a paler, more orangey coat than the agouti colour *\\"mottled\\" or \\"pied\\" -- both dominant and recessive mutations have been identified, these hamsters have the agouti colouring (or husky/blue/black/cinnamon) with irregular patches of white over their heads, bodies and sometimes their faces. *\\"platinum\\" -- a combination of the dominant white face gene and the husky gene that produces a hamster that looks similar to a white-faced when young, but fades with age to nearly white *\\"head spot\\" -- a combination of the dominant and recessive pied genes that creates a pure white animal with one patch of colour on the head *\\"white-from-white-faced\\" or \\"dark-eared white\\" -- a combination of the dominant white-faced gene and the husky gene that produces a white hamster that retains a greyish undercoat and ears *\\"white-from-pied\\" or \\"pure white\\" -- a combination of the two pied genes that produces a pure white hamster *\\"red-eyed\\" -- a recessive mutation that produces a cinnamon-coloured hamster with a chocolate undercoat, dark brown (red) eyes, and pale ears *Black/blue - Originally bred in Finland, going to The Netherlands and then Germany. Black and blue are two recessive genes still being investigated. These genes came to the UK in 2017 via Doric Hamstery and the first UK litter of blacks were born there Spring 2018. Both are thought to be self colours behaving like melanistic and its further dilution to blue that is already found in other species. Breeding in captivity has also produced a darker variation of the naturally sandy-coloured agouti fur. According to Fox (2006) white faced and derived breeds are considered torture-breeding and therefore breeding them is forbidden by law in several European countries like Germany or Austria. The homozygous carrier of the gene variant causes neurological symptoms similar to the whirling disease, where the animal spins itself around until it dies of exhaustion. p. 11, p. 50 This concern is not seen in recessive white face (husky). Breeding The gender of a Roborovski is determined visually; female openings are very close together and may even look like a single opening, while male openings are further apart. Males usually have a visible scent gland near the navel above the two openings, appearing as a yellow stain in older animals. The breeding season for the Roborovski hamster is between April and September. The gestation period is between 20 and 22 days, producing three to four litters. The litter size is between three and nine, with an average of six. Captive bred Roborovski do often breed all year round. The offspring weigh - at birth. Upon being born, the offspring have no fur, the incisors and claws are visible, but the eyes, pinnae of the ear and digits are all sealed. After a period of three days, the whiskers become visible and after five days, the first dorsal hairs develop. The digits separate after six days and after eleven days, the body is completely formed. The young hamsters open their eyes by day 14. As pets Roborovski hamsters have become increasingly popular as pets in recent years, however, they are best suited to life as merely observational creatures, with limited interaction between them and humans, due to their increased activity levels that lead to a high stress predisposition and decreased ease of handling when compared to other domestic hamster species. On average, Roborovski hamsters will live 26 months in captivity. Although claimed to be hypoallergenic, Roborovski hamsters have been associated with the development of asthma in previously asymptomatic owners. In rare emergency situations, a shallow dish of warm water may be necessary to clean harmful substances from a hamster's fur; however, under normal circumstances, hamsters should never be bathed in water as, aside from being incredibly stressful, this can remove vital protective oils from their coat, which can be very dangerous and potentially fatal. Hamsters frequently groom themselves, and instead of water, a sand bath should be offered to help them stay clean and healthy (See 'Bedding/Substrate' subsection for more information). = Housing = Unlike other species of hamster (see 'Golden hamster'), Roborovski hamsters can sometimes be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups if raised together from a young age. A lone, or pair of Roborovski hamsters should be kept in a cage ideally 50 x 100 cm, or the equivalent of 0.5sq metres with at least 15‚Äì20 cm of substrate, so that they may exercise their natural urge to burrow. However, greater floor space and substrate depth is recommended for all species of hamsters, where \\"bigger is always better\\" . Additional levels do not count toward the base area. Aquariums and DIY-enclosures are commonly used amongst hamster enthusiasts, often preferred for their capability to hold greater amounts of substrate, wide availability, and cost, amongst various other reasons, over their more traditional wire-cage counterparts (See images for examples). If fighting within a group occurs, the hamsters should be separated immediately to avoid injury. Roborovski hamsters are very active, so a species-appropriate wheel is a necessity. Size is still debated, however the general consensus is that a wheel should be no bigger than 16.5 cm (6.5 inches) because of their Robo hamsters are small and it will be hard for them to move a wheel much bigger. Other sources recommend a diameter of 20 cm(8 inches). Roborovski hamsters, like many rodents, will naturally avoid large open spaces, opting to stick close to the walls if forced to cross one, where they feel safest. Providing them with multiple hiding spots is vital. This can be achieved by placing branches, tunnels and various other hides in close arrangement. = Food = Based on their natural diet, owners should feed hamster food containing mainly grains and small seeds. Animal protein should also be offered, in form of mealworms, grasshoppers or other insects. If you do not like to feed them alive, you can purchase dried insects. Some hamsters also accept seafood such as dried gammarus. To support their natural behaviour of foraging and stockpiling, feed should be scattered around the enclosure, hidden in several spots, or slightly buried beneath the substrate (Approximately 1tsp of food per hamster per day). Some unsuitable foods, to be avoided, include: * Leafy green parts of a Tomato (toxic) * Meats which are high in fat * Chocolate or candy * Onions, garlic & peppers (can cause stomach irritation) * All citrus fruits (too acidic) * Apple seeds * Aubergine Fresh water should be available at all times. A bowl is preferable to a bottle, as it encourages a more natural and comfortable drinking posture. Hamsters' incisors never stop growing and they have a ‚Äòself-sharpening‚Äô system where the incisors grind against each other while gnawing, which wears the teeth down; so providing them with chew-toys is essential. = Bedding/Substrate = Nesting materials should be easily shreddable and digestible, such as unscented toilet paper, moss, hay or leaves. Avoid materials that separate into thin strands when chewed (such as cotton wool or similar 'fluffy' bedding products), as entanglement or ingestion poses a serious health risk to hamsters. Softwood shavings (such as pine or cedar) are also unsuitable as they contain harmful chemicals which can damage a hamster's respiratory system. Conversely, hardwood shavings such as aspen are perfectly safe to use. To provide a means of cleaning itself and to help mimic its natural habitat, a large bowl of sand should be available at all times. Dust bathing is a vital part of a hamster's daily routine and helps to keep their coat healthy and shiny by removing excess oils.Flint, 1966 (\\"Biotopes\\" p. 20‚Äì21). The sand can be kept clean by sieving or washing out with water and drying. Children's play sand is a viable option for this, but be sure what happened to it (such as if you need to bake it). Sand must be dust-free. Chinchilla sand is too dusty for hamsters and can cause respiratory problems. Bird sand is also not suitable, because it contains sharp elements such as shards of broken shell.

As of April 3, 2008, KUNM has translators broadcasting at 90.5 in Eagle Nest-Cimarron (K213ET), 91.1 in Cuba (K216CU) and at 91.9 in Nageezi (Dzilth-Na-O-Dit) (K220EM). In addition, KUNM has full-power transmitters at 88.7 Socorro (KBOM), 91.9 Espanola (KRAR), and 90.9 Arroyo Seco (KRRT). Translators at 91.1 in Arroyo Seco (K216AL) and at 91.9 in Taos (K220AV) went silent with the upgrade to KRRT's transmitter status. At writing, KUNM features a range of locally produced music shows, local and national news coverage, and public affairs programming. The call letters \\"KUNM\\" reference the University of New Mexico. The call letters \\"KBOM\\" are sardonic humour: the transmitter reaches the Trinity Nuclear Test Site. \\"KRAR\\" stands for \\"Rio Arriba Radio\\", since Espanola is located in Rio Arriba County. KRRT stands for \\"Radio Relay Taos\\". The station is currently funded through a combination of listener sponsorship, underwriting by local businesses and support from nonprofits, student fees, and various other sources. Listener support accounts for a little over 50% of the station's total annual operating budget. KUNM broadcasts in HD. History The following brief, and very incomplete, history of KUNM is largely compiled from internal documents, available to any on-air volunteer, written by former station manager Steve van Dresser and long-time station volunteer Claude Stephenson. KUNM began life in 1960 as KNMD, a carrier current AM radio station on the campus. According to former station manager Steve van Dresser, \\"small AM transmitters [were] located in each dorm [at UNM]\\" and the Student Union Building. The signal was broadcast... through the AC power circuits... from about 2 in the afternoon until about 6\\". According to longtime station volunteer Claude Stephenson, fraternity and sorority members, as well as other students living off campus, complained that their student fees were being used to pay for a service they could not receive. In 1964, the Radio Board decided the best solution was to obtain a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) educational broadcast license for a transmitter on Sandia Crest. The board ultimately decided in 1965 to broadcast from a transmitter on top of the Student Union Building \\"until the funds [could] be gathered to move [the transmitter] to [Sandia] Crest\\". The Board of Regents made the application in March 1966 for a construction permit. The station desired the call letters KUNM but ran into an objection from another Albuquerque radio station: KBNM, which had adopted those call letters on March 18, 1966.FCC History Cards for KBNM As a result, on October 19, 1966, the station went on the air with the provisional call letters KLNB. The station was able to claim the KUNM call letters several weeks later. The original transmitter broadcast with an effective radiated power of 3,700 watts. It was at roughly this time that Ramsey Lewis's \\"The In Crowd\\" became a part of the station's musical history. According to van Dresser, this is the period during which the station began airing the cutting-edge music of the mid-to-late 1960s. Stephenson dates \\"The In Crowd\\" as becoming an important musical milestone in the station's history to 1968. At the same time, the station was, in his words, \\"literally in the middle\\" of the \\"third most violent [campus] confrontation\\" in the wake of the \\"Cambodian Incursion\\" during the Vietnam War, during which the New Mexico National Guard was called out to expel students who \\"took over the Student Union Building\\". The first and second most violent confrontations, van Dresser reports, occurred at Kent State University and Jackson State University. He says KUNM provided a \\"feed\\" to CBS news and \\"did live networking with Pacifica\\" during the event. Van Dresser was succeeded by L. A. \\"Woody\\" Woodworth, formerly the station's program director, as station manager. Woodworth was, in turn, \\"I think\\", as van Dresser puts it, succeeded by Mike Wolfe. In 1974, KUNM filed to move its transmitter to Sandia Crest. Hubbard Broadcasting, owner of KOB-AM-TV, filed a petition to deny to the application, but the application was conditionally approved in 1975. KUNM moved its studios from the Student Union Building to O√±ate Hall in 1976, and the Sandia Crest transmitter site was turned on in September of that year. KUNM became a member of NPR in 1978, following the bankruptcy and closure of KIPC. Funding for this transition was accomplished through benefit concerts at the Kiva Auditorium in downtown Albuquerque. The station's first national broadcast contribution was an exclusive interview with Manuel Noriega by a KUNM news reporter. KUNM was among the first radio stations to carry Amy Goodman's Democracy Now! in the mid-199s. John McCall, a UNM law student appointed as Radio Board member, and Spencer Walaitis, a KUNM volunteer and community activist/musician, campaigned for the program and encountered some opposition on the Radio Board. According to McCall, when the two went to address a volunteer meeting and encourage support for inclusion of DN! in the program lineup, Walaitis suffered a heart attack shortly after his speech to the volunteers. He died there in O√±ate Hall despite valiant efforts of the volunteers to save him. He left behind a wife and young children. After the death of Spencer Walaitis there was very little opposition to the inclusion of DN! in the program lineup. The transmitter atop the crest of the Sandia Mountains (Sandia Crest) was upgraded to broadcast a digital signal in November 2006. Signal expansions In 2008, KUNM launched three high-power repeaters. KBOM in Socorro signed on February 15, 2008, broadcasting from \\"Mountain M\\" at 88.7 MHz. KRAR in Espa√±ola followed on April 1, 2008, with 6,000 watts from Black Mesa on 91.9 MHz. Two days later, the new Arroyo Seco station, KRRT 90.9 MHz, came into service. The new stations replaced translators at 91.1 in Taos (K220AV) and 91.9 in Arroyo Seco (K216AL). Programming Five times a week, KUNM airs the live call-in show Native America Calling. Native America Calling is the only nationally syndicated call-in talk show focusing on Native American issues. In fall of 2006, the in- house, half-hour \\"Evening Report\\" was reformatted to incorporate local and regional news stories into NPR's national newsmagazine All Things Considered thus eliminating some NPR stories. Early weekday afternoons highlight locally produced jazz programming, and Free Form which features local hosts playing a wide range of music. Late mornings feature classical music from American Public Media. Evening music programming varies from acoustic folk to experimental electronic. Weekend programming is primarily volunteer-produced music, talk and radio theater programs including a program produced by and with youth, \\"Generation Justice\\". The weekend often closes out on Sunday evenings with a broadcast of the national radio theater show Playing On Air. KUNM broadcasts syndicated programming for several hours each day. National Public Radio (NPR) is broadcast during the morning and evening \\"drive time\\", interspersed with local news. NPR programming provides national news programs seven days a week. KUNM is an NPR Member station. Pacifica Radio programming includes Democracy Now!, Public Radio International programming includes Afropop Worldwide, American Public Media programming includes Performance Today. Role of Volunteers at KUNM KUNM is a hybrid station combining characteristics of a public station, complete with National Public Radio and other nationally syndicated programming, with day-time and evening prime time local programming produced by an active base of volunteers from the local community as well as the University of New Mexico student body. Currently there are nearly 100 volunteers producing about 75% of the on-air content. Volunteers at KUNM have played a central role in the functioning of the station over the years. In 1987 recently hired Station Manager Tim Singleton made it known that the station's Morning and Afternoon Freeform programs were to be replaced with more standard NPR-style jazz and classical programming, including nationally syndicated programming produced outside of New Mexico. The response of the volunteers was an 18-month strike, with strong community support, and accompanying first amendment and other legal actions against the University of New Mexico. A settlement was reached in the Fall of 1988, that included a re-vamped Radio Board with a significant amount of say on programming changes, and a Volunteer Agreement that clarifies volunteer rights at the station.

It stands on high ground, near the northwest bank of the river North Esk. The name The name Roslin (recorded around 1240 as Roskelyn) probably derives from the Celtic words ros, meaning a moor, and celyn, meaning holly. An alternative derivation is from Gaelic ros, meaning a rocky promontory, and linne, meaning a waterfall or pool.Plaque at Rosslyn Chapel The theory that it is a corruption of Roseline, a supposed medieval meridian passing through Paris and Rosslyn Chapel, is fanciful. Roslin is believed to be the source of the name for the Village of Roslyn, on Long Island, in the U.S. State of New York; its location reminded officials of the hills in Roslin. History Legend has it the village was founded in 203 A.D. by Asterius, a Pict. In 1303 Roslin was the site of a battle of the First War of Scottish Independence. In 1446, Rosslyn Chapel was constructed, under the guide of William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness. Roslin became important as the seat of the St Clair (or Sinclair) family. In 1456 King James II granted it the status of a burgh. Coal mining has been a major occupation from the twelfth to the late twentieth centuries. From the 19th century onward, the attractions of the Glen, Castle and Chapel developed Roslin as a popular tourist destination. Notable visitors included J. M. W. Turner,William Wordsworth (who wrote a poem in the chapel whilst escaping a storm) and his sister Dorothy, who wrote ‚Äú'I never passed through a more delicious dell than the glen of Rosslyn‚Äù. William Morris visited in March 1887, noting in his Socialist Diary that Roslin was \\"a beautiful glen-ny landscape much spoiled . . . by the misery of Scotch building and a manufactory or two.\\" On the north-western side of the village used to be Roslin Institute, a biological research establishment, where in 1996 Dolly the sheep became the first animal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.1997: Dolly the sheep is cloned On This Day, BBC News online It moved to Easter Bush in 2011.

The dough is then separated and the portions baked as individual cookies, or eaten as it is. Cookie dough can be homemade or bought pre-made in packs (frozen logs, buckets, etc.). Desserts containing cookie dough, such as ice cream, candy, and milkshakes are also frequently marketed and sold. Pre-made cookie doughs may be sold in different flavors. When being made at home, the recipe can consist of common ingredients, including flour, butter, white sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and eggs. Because the dough is not baked, no leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder are used. If cookie dough is intended to be used to bake cookies then baking soda or baking powder gets added to the dough. Chocolate chip cookie dough is a popular variation which can be made by adding chocolate chips to the mix. Health risks Because of the presence of raw egg and raw flour, the consumption of uncooked cookie dough increases the possibility of contracting foodborne illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly discourages the consumption of all food products containing raw egg or raw flour because of the threat from disease-causing bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli. Two tablespoons of milk can be swapped for eggs in cookie recipes, and two cups of flour can be microwaved for 50‚Äì60 seconds to get rid of any bacteria. Leavening, such as baking powder or baking soda can be removed. Doing this will allow the cookie dough to be edible. There have been a number of outbreaks related to consumption of cookie dough and pathogens in flour. For example, raw flour was found to be the culprit in a June 2009 E. coli outbreak involving Nestl√© Toll House prepackaged cookie dough, which was recalled; more than 7,000 people fell ill as a result, although none died. In 2010, Nestle decided to switch to heat-treated processing for all flour used in producing cookie dough. In 2016, General Mills recalled flour and cake mixes because of E. coli found in the raw flour. In 2015, there was a recall of certain Blue Bell Ice Cream products due to Listeria monocytogenes found in the facility that produces cookie dough for the ice cream's chocolate chip cookie dough and other cookie dough containing flavors.  Edible cookie dough  Cookie dough designed specifically for eating raw (such as that found in ice cream) is made without raw eggs and uses heat-treated flour to reduce the presence of microbial pathogens.Hadley Malcolm, Is any cookie dough safe to eat?, USA Today (1 July 2016). Edible cookie dough, egg-free and made with specially treated flour, became a dessert trend and led to the creation of several businesses. Some sweet shops sell multiple desserts with cookie dough as only one option, and others solely create and sell dough.

It was a battle fought between Greek and Ottoman forces during the First Balkan War, and revolved around the Sorovich area. The 5th Greek Division which had been advancing through western Macedonia separately from the bulk of the Greek army, encamped at Sorovich where it found itself to be heavily outnumbered by an opposing Ottoman force. After withstanding repeated attacks between 22 and 23 October, it broke ranks on the early morning of 24 October; after Ottoman machine gunners struck its flank in an early morning surprise attack. The Greek defeat at Sorovich resulted in the Serbian capture of the contested city of Monastir. Background The disastrous Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 exposed major flaws in the Greek Army's organization, training and logistics. Georgios Theotokis was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new table of organization was introduced for the country's navy and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the Goudi coup seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos to rule the country. Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of reserve classes for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a British naval mission and a French military mission. After being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in Sofia to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the Ottomans, it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of Macedonia. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose Balkan League alliance with Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to Thrace; the Balkan League responded in kind. On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring war against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September. Prelude The Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked Elassona, resulting in an Ottoman withdrawal towards Sarandaporo. At 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally. In the meantime, the cavalry brigade, 4th and 5th Divisions conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of striking the rear of the Ottoman positions. Despite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. At 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division marched into Servia, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed the following day. After their defeat at Sarandaporo, the Ottomans augmented the remnants of Hasan Tahsin Pasha's force with fresh reinforcements and organized their main defensive line at Yenidje. On 18 October, Crown Prince Constantine ordered the bulk of the Army of Thessaly to head towards Yenidje despite receiving conflicting intelligence reports regarding the disposition of the enemy troops. In the meantime, the 5th Greek Division under Dimitrios Matthaiopoulos, continued its advance across western Macedonia; aiming at reaching the Kailaria-Perdika area, where it was to await further orders. Either uniting with the rest of the Army of Thessaly or capture Monastir. After crossing the Kirli Deven pass, it reached Banitsa on 19 October. The 5th Greek Division continued its march through the Florina plain during the night of 19 October. At 11 a.m. 20 October, it was attacked by an Ottoman division which had been brought to the area by rail from Monastir. Although the Serbians were aware of this maneuver, they only allocated a limited a number of troops to strike the Ottoman rear, as they intended to seize Monastir first. Seeing that his troops were exhausted and exposed to Ottoman fire on the plain, Matthaiopoulos ordered a retreat towards Sorovich at 6 p.m. After passing through Kirli Derven, the 5th Division camped at Sorovich next to the Petersko lake. Matthaiopoulos placed his 7,000 infantrymen north-east of the town, the 20 artillery pieces were stationed in the Sotiras village, while 80 cavalry were to protect the western flank of the division at Giouloun. Battle On 22 October, the 18th Ottoman Infantry Division split into two columns, simultaneously attacking Sorovich from the direction of Xino Nero and Petersko. The Ottoman charge was suppressed by Greek artillery fire, leading to an artillery duel that lasted for the remainder of the day. A second Ottoman offensive from Petersko was successfully repulsed during the night. Unbeknownst to the Greeks, the 18th Ottoman Infantry Division which already outnumbered them was reinforced by the 16th and 17th Ottoman Infantry Divisions bringing the total number of the Ottomans to 20,000 men. On 23 October, the Ottomans launched a series of large scale attacks on the Greek center and eastern flank. The 5th Division held its ground, counter-attacking at 4 p.m. and driving a wedge between the Ottoman center and its western flank. This caused the Ottomans to flee the battlefield during the night, while the Greeks took hold of the nearby railway line and road junction. The 5th Division was also augmented by its rearguard, 3 infantry companies and 3 engineering companies. While the Ottomans who had just been defeated at the Battle of Prilep, withdrew most of their troops at Sorovich to Monastir in an effort to halt the Serbian drive towards the city. Shortly before the dawn of 24 October, a company belonging to the 17th Ottoman Division armed with several machine guns approached the Greek western flank undetected. At 6.30 a.m., it opened fire on the Greek positions at Spantza while the defenders were still asleep. The Ottomans penetrated the Greek lines, capturing an artillery battery and signalling another Ottoman unit to attack from the east. The soldiers guarding the Greek eastern flank offered stubborn resistance, refusing to yield until given a written order, while the rest of the 5th Division fled in panic. The Greek eastern flank was eventually overpowered, while many Greek soldiers were killed by Ottoman riflemen and sympathetic civilians. Aftermath Greek casualties in the battle of Sorovich numbered 168 killed, 196 wounded and 10 prisoners of war. Although the Greek victory at the Battle of Yenidje, overshadowed the defeat at Sorovich, it perplexed Greek Crown Prince Constantine making him hesitate just as the Greek majority city of Thessaloniki seemed to be within his grasp. The remnants of the 5th Division assembled in Kailaria and were reorganized in Kozani on 25 October. On 29 October, Constantine allocated the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions and a cavalry brigade for the capture of Monastir. Those forces convened at Edessa on 2 November and were eventually able to seize Florina, yet Monastir fell into Serbian hands after the conclusion of the eponymous battle. By May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching Constantinople. On 30 May, the two sides signed the Treaty of London which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of Enos on the Aegean Sea and north of Midia on the Black Sea, as well as Crete. The fate of Albania and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the Great Powers.

Noggings may be made of timber, steel, or aluminium. If made of timber they are cut slightly longer than the space they fit into, and are driven into place so they fit tightly or are rabbeted into the wall stud. The interval between noggings is dictated by local building codes and by the type of timber used; a typical timber-framed house in a non-cyclonic area will have two or three noggings per storey between each pair of neighbouring studs. Additional noggings may be added as grounds for later fixings. Noggings between vertical studs generally brace the studs against buckling under load; noggings on floor joists prevent the joists from twisting or rotating under load (lateral-torsional buckling), and are often fixed at intervals, in pairs diagonally for that reason. In floors this type of bracing is also called herringbone strutting. Noggings provide no bracing effect in shear and are generally supplemented by diagonal bracing to prevent the frame from racking.

As an ongoing part of the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman Vardar Army retreated from the defeat at Kumanovo and regrouped around Bitola. The Serbian 1st Army, marching for Bitola, encountered heavy Ottoman artillery fire and had to wait for its own artillery to arrive. On 18 November, following the destruction of the Ottoman artillery by Serbian artillery, the Serbian right flank pushed through the Vardar Army. The Serbs then entered Bitola on 19 November.

After the battle of Monastir, the five-century- long Ottoman rule of Macedonia was over. The Serbian 1st Army continued fighting in the First Balkan War. At this point some Serbs wanted the 1st Army to continue its advance down the valley of the Vardar to Thessaloniki. Vojvoda Putnik refused. The threat of war with Austria-Hungary loomed over the issue of a Serbian presence on the Adriatic. In addition, with the Bulgarians and Greeks already in Thessaloniki, the appearance of Serbian forces there would only muddle an already complicated situation.

AllMusic compared the band's musical style to the shoegazing music played by Ride, Swervedriver and Catherine Wheel. Band history The band was formed in late 1998 by guitarist Jeramy Koepping and Peter Marchese on guitar and vocals. They recruited bassist Dayna Loeffler and a series of drummers before John HollisAllmusic.com names the drummer as John Hollis in their article and John Hollis Fleischman in the overview. The drummer's full name is John Hollis Fleischman. joined the band. The band recorded a demo record Zeroes and Ones, Parts One and Two in 1999, which received airplay on Seattle independent radio station KCMU (now KEXP) leading to the band being signed to Loveless Records. Their debut record From the New Nation of Long Shadows was released in 2000. Monster Zero followed in 2002 on Loveless Records, then followed by Dissolver on Tokyoidaho Records in 2005, and Afterhours in the Afterlife on Loveless Records in 2008. Several EPs have also been released as well as appearing on various compilations. Voyager One live shows typically included visual effects from several 16mm film projectors operated by Projectorhead. The projectors show spliced-together clips of salvaged short films on the wall behind the band. Projectorhead collects the source material for and assembles the films. Two video recordings of Projectorhead's work have been released on DVD, Shadows and Daydreams and Magic Time Bomb. Voyager One toured the U.S. west coast several times and toured the southeast states with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on their Howl tour in 2006. The band also made several trips to festivals such as CMJ in New York City and SXSW in Austin. Voyager One went on an indefinite hiatus in 2011. At that time, the line-up included Jasun Hadaway and Elliott Nutt. Peter Marchese, Jasun Hadaway, and Elliott Nutt then formed a new band, Tokyoidaho. Jeramy Koepping, who had started the band Grand Hallway with Tomo Nakayama in 2007, continued working with that band until 2011. He now works with Matthew Emerson Brown (Trespassers William) and Joshua Morrison to score films and release music under the name St Kilda. Jasun Hadaway and former drummer Tony Zuniga are currently members of Seattle band, Black Nite Crash.

They have released eight albums, a number of split albums and EP.  Career  They formed in 1998 in a pub, when bartender and drummer Dave Weeks overheard a conversation between two customers, Chris Martin (guitar) and Lucy Atkinson (bassist) about analog recording. Weeks joined the discussion, and they found they also shared mutual musical interests, and hence agreed to form a band. They started playing live the same year. Near the end of 1999, guitarist/keyboardist/flautist Matthew Reid Schwartz was added to the line-up. Kinski issued its first record Space Launch for Frenchie earlier that same year consisting of six tracks running for 45 minutes. The band went on their first US tour with Mainliner from Japan, where they befriended Kawabata Makoto, also of Acid Mothers Temple. Tours throughout the US would follow the next two years with such bands as Hovercraft, Silkworm, and Primordial Undermind. Their second album, Be Gentle With the Warm Turtle, came out on Pacifico in 2001. The band also toured Japan with Acid Mothers Temple in late 2001. In early 2002, after the band finished recording their third album, Weeks left and later went on to join Seattle band Black Panties. That summer, Barrett Wilke took over on drums. The band at this time signed with Sub Pop. The album Airs Above Your Station was released in 2003. Later in 2003, Sub Pop issued a split album with Kinski and Acid Mothers Temple. Each band contributed their own material for this release, along with two collaborative pieces that were recorded during their earlier tour of Japan. Finally, the three-way \\"triptych\\" split, Crickets and Fireflies, was released by the Music Fellowship label with the bands Paik & Surface of Eceon. Around the time that Weeks left the band, the remaining members began performing as an improvisational threesome under the name Herzog. An album, Don't Climb on and Take the Holy Water, was issued in 2004 by the Strange Attractors Audio House label consisting of live recordings from Herzog performances. The band also contributed a track to the Franco Battiato tribute album, What's Your Function. A brief west coast tour with Mission of Burma rounded out the year. In 2005, the band came back with Alpine Static, their sixth album overall and third on Sub Pop produced by Randall Dunn. Tours throughout the US, Europe, and Japan followed, stopping in London for a session with Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1. Kinski was the opening act during the spring 2007 leg of Tool's 10,000 Days tour. Just before leaving for this tour, they finished their seventh album, Down Below It's Chaos which was released on August 21, 2007. In August 2012, it was announced that Kinski' had signed with Kill Rock Stars. The album, Cosy Moments was released April 3, 2013. In February 2015 the band released a split EP with fellow Seattle band Sandrider on Seattle label Good to Die Records.\\"Sandrider / Kinski split out February 17th, 2015\\", Goodtodirerecords.com The second album on Kill Rock Stars entitled 7 (or 8), was recorded and mixed in San Francisco at El Studio with Phil Manley (of Trans Am) and was released in June 2015. In 2017 Kinski adapted a passage of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake for the Waywords and Meansigns project. In August 2018, it was announced that for Kinski's 20th anniversary as a band, they would be releasing a vinyl reissue of Be Gentle With the Warm Turtle as well as releasing a new album titled Accustomed To Your Face, with both albums being released on Kill Rock Stars on October 12th, 2018.

H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, Ernest Hemingway, and Eugene Jolas. It enjoyed the greatest longevity among the several expatriate presses founded in Paris during the 1920s, publishing nearly three times as many titles as did Edward Titus under his Black Manikin Press. American expatriates living in Paris, Harry Crosby and his wife Caresse Crosby (American inventor of the modern bra) founded the press to publish their own work in April 1927 as √âditions Narcisse. They added to that in 1928 when they printed a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. They enjoyed the reception their initial work received, and decided to expand the press to serve other authors, renaming the company the Black Sun Press, following on Harry's obsession on the symbolism of the sun. They published exclusively limited quantities of meticulously produced, hand-manufactured books, printed on high-quality paper. During the 1920s and 1930s Paris was at the crossroads of many emerging expatriate American writers, collectively called the Lost Generation. They published early works of a number of writers before they were well-known, including James Joyce's Tales Told of Shem and Shaun (which was later integrated into Finnegans Wake. They published Kay Boyle's first book-length work, Short Stories, in 1929. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. After Harry died in a suicide pact with one of his many lovers, Caresse Crosby continued the press' work into the 1940s. Publish own works Cover of Tales of Shem and Shaun by James Joyce published by Caresse Crosby and Harry Crosby, owners and publishers of the Black Sun Press. Harry and Caresse Crosby began publishing their own poetry in 1925. One of their first two books was a volume of poetry by Caresse, Crosses of Gold, printed by L√©on Pichon and published in 1925. Its frontleaf bore their names in the form of a gold cross with the 'r' in Caresse intersecting the first 'r' in Harry's name. The second was Harry‚Äôs Sonnets for Caresse. Dissatisfied with the quality of the printing of these books they sought out Roger Lescaret, a master printer, whose shop at No. 2, Rue Cardinale was not far from the Crosbys' apartment in Paris. His previous works had been limited to funeral notices, but that did not deter them. Lescaret printed Harry Crosby's next collection of poetry, Red Skeletons, with illustrations by their friend Alastair, as well as other volumes of poetry including Harry Crosby's Painted Shores (1927), said to be heavily influenced by Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe. They were so happy with the result that they decided to start a press to publish other works. They followed with two books by Caresse, Painted Shores and The Stranger. Expand press They rented space above Roger Lescaret's print shop at 2, rue Cardinal. The books were handmade, \\"lavishly bound, typographically impeccable\\" versions of unusual books that interested them, like The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair (Baron Hans Henning Voigt). They printed a Hindu \\"Love Book,\\" and letters sent to Harry‚Äôs cousin, Walter Berry, by Henry James. Harry chose the titles and Caresse edited the books. Both selected the typeface, margins, and so forth. Harry created the bindings, boxes, and ribbons in expensive state-of-the art materials made by Babout. The Crosbys published a number of eminent 20th century authors before they became well-known, including D. H. Lawrence and James Joyce, both of whom were friends of Crosbys. Additional authors published by the Black Sun Press include Kay Boyle, whose first book Short Stories was published by Black Sun. Other authors included Ezra Pound, Archibald MacLeish, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Jolas and Oscar Wilde. Support experimental writing In 1927, they became editors of poet Eugene Jolas' quarterly literary Journal transition, an outlet for experimental writing that featured the most modern, surrealist, and other linguistically innovative writing. They were frequent visitors to Shakespeare and Company, a bookshop founded by Sylvia Beach. They sold their collection of Kay Boyle's short stories through Shakespeare and Company. In 1928, Harry and Caresse changed the name of the press to the Black Sun Press in keeping with Harry's fascination with the symbolism of the sun. The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books. They took exquisite care with the books they published, choosing the finest papers and inks. Expand literary circle Their literary tastes matured and they sought out their Parisian literary friends and offered to publish their writing. Their friends included D. H. Lawrence, for whom they published a limited edition of 50 copies of The Escaped Cock, illustrated by John Farleigh, in September 1929 (later re- published as The Man Who Died). Lawrence later wrote the introduction to Harry Crosby's volume of poetry, Chariot of the Sun. Harry occasionally spent time with one of their authors, Ernest Hemingway, who he had met skiing, and in July 1927 they visited Pamplona for the running of the bulls. Harry often drank to excess when with Hemingway. Although Harry spoke fluent French, they socialized primarily among fellow American expatriates. They became close friends with some of the authors they worked with. When Harry visited New York in 1928, he cashed in some stock dividends to help Boyle pay for an abortion. In 1928, Harry's cousin Walter Berry died, leaving a considerable collection of over 8,000 mostly rare books. In his will he left \\"all the rest of my books...except such books which Edith Wharton may desire to take...I give and bequeath to my cousin, Harry Grew Crosby.\\" Harry eagerly campaigned to persuade Berry's long-time friend Edith Wharton to give him a great many of the books, and in the end she kept less than 100. Harry prized the collection at first but he became enamored of the idea of reducing the things around him. Caresse later wrote, \\"We had talked to a wise man in Egypt in 1928 who said, 'My wealth I measure by the things I do without,' and Harry believed the books weighed him down.\\" Every morning he would leave with a satchel full of rare books, despite Caresse's attempts to persuade him otherwise, and give them to waiters, barmen, and cab drivers; sometimes he would sneak them into antiquarian bookshops that lined the Seine with ridiculously low prices penciled into them. The Black Sun Press also published the poetry of Archibald MacLeish, who had like Harry overturned the normal expectations of society, rejecting a career as a lawyer with one of Boston's best law firms and lecturing at Harvard. Harry offered to publish MacLeish's long poem Einstein in a deluxe edition, and paid MacLeish US$200 for his work. They printed 150 copies which were quickly sold. In February 1929, Hart Crane arrived in Paris. He had received $2,000 from Arts patron Otto H. Kahn in 1928 to begin work on what became a book-length poem, The Bridge, but was frustrated at his lack of progress. He wore out his welcome at the home of his lover, Emil Opffer, and Crane left for Paris in early 1929. After he got to Paris, Harry offered him the use of the Crosby's country retreat, Le Moulin du Soleil, in Ermenonville, so he could concentrate on working on his poem. Crane spent several weeks there and roughed out a draft of the \\"Cape Hatteras\\" section, a key part of the epic poem. In late June that year, Crane returned from the south of France to Paris. Harry noted in his journal, \\"Hart C. back from Marseilles where he slept with his thirty sailors and he began again to drink Cutty Sark...\\" Crane, a heavy drinker since his early days in New York, got drunk at the Cafe Select and fought with waiters over his tab. When the Paris police were called, he fought with them and was beaten. They arrested and jailed him, fining him 800 francs. After six days in prison at La Sant√©, Harry Crosby paid Crane's fine and advanced him money for the passage back to the United States where he finally finished The Bridge. In 1929, through bookstore owner Sylvia Beach, they contacted James Joyce and arranged to print three of his stories that had already appeared in translation. They named the new book Tales Told of Shem and Shaun (which was later integrated into Finnegans Wake), for which they paid Joyce US$2000 for 600 copies, unusually good pay for Joyce at that time. Their printer Roger Lescaret erred when setting the type, leaving the final page with only two lines. Rather than reset the entire book, he suggested to the Crosby's that they ask Joyce to write an additional eight lines to fill in the remainder of the page. Caresse refused, insisting that a literary master would never alter his work to fix a printer's error. Lescaret appealed directly to Joyce, who promptly wrote the eight lines requested. The first 100 copies of Joyce's book were printed on Japanese velum and signed by the author. It was hand-set in Caslon type and included an abstract portrait of Joyce by Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, a pioneer of modernist abstract sculpture. Br√¢ncu»ôi's drawings of Joyce became among the most popular images of him. During the rest of 1929, they published fourteen works by Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Ren√© Crevel, T. S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound among others. Caresse wrote a book of poetry, Crosses of Gold, which they published. The Crosbys also published early works by newly emerging writers including Ramon Sartoris, Julien Levy, and Dorothy Parker. Beautiful books in limited editions Cover from Transit of Venus, poetry written by Harry Crosby and published by Black Sun Press, in 1929.The books they published were \\"beautifully bound, hand set books.\\" One of their most beautiful books was the Hindu Love Manual which they first found while on holiday in Damascus. They reprinted it in October 1928 in a release of only 20 copies. Bound in navy blue leather, the cover was stamped with gold to reflect the style of ancient Persian manuscripts. The inside pages were printed on handmade paper colored a distinctive shade of gray and decorated with a gold border. Each illustration in every copy was hand- colored. Illustration by Alastair from Harry Crosby's book Red Skeletons, published in 1927. Their books were generally published in small numbers, usually less than 500 copies, sometimes as few as 10 or 20. They were \\"marked by clean lines, sharp typeface, and fine inks and papers.\\" Some editions were published first as a \\"limited\\" edition, usually numbered and autographed, showcased with detailed design and costly materials, followed by a less expensive \\"trade\\" edition. Most were issued in slipcases. They published Les Liaisons Dangereuses with illustrations by Alastair. The cover was red-purple cloth with gilt lettering; it contained 14 engravings on color plates, with tissue guards, and numerous in-text illustrations. In 1929, they published Harry Crosby's volume of verse, Mad Queen, which showed the influence of Surrealism and which included withering attacks on Bostonian tradition. Apart from his obsession with the sun, his writing increasingly contained references to dissolution and suicide. He viewed death as violent, quick, and liberating. Affair and suicide On July 9, 1928, Harry met 20-year-old Josephine Noyes Rotch, ten years his junior, and began a troublesome affair with her. She had been known around Boston as \\"fast, a 'bad egg'...with a good deal of sex appeal.\\" Josephine would inspire Crosby's next collection of poems which he dedicated to her, titled Transit of Venus. Josephine married Albert Smith Bigelow on June 21, 1929, but Harry and Josephine rekindled their affair within a few weeks. Unlike his wife Caresse, Josephine was quarrelsome and prone to fits of jealousy. She bombarded Harry with half incoherent cables and letters, anxious to set the date for their next tryst. =Visit to United States= In December 1929, the Crosbys returned to the United States for a visit and the Harvard-Yale football game. Harry and Josephine went to Detroit and checked into the expensive ($12 a day) Book-Cadillac Hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Harry Crane. For four days they took meals in their room, smoked opium, and made love. On December 7 the lovers returned to New York. That evening Crosby's friend Hart Crane threw a party to celebrate his completion after seven years of his poem, The Bridge, which was to be published by the Black Sun Press, and to bid Harry and Caresse bon voyage, since they were due to sail back to France the next week. The party went on until nearly dawn, and Harry and Caresse made plans to see Crane again on December 10 to see the play Berkeley Square before they left for Europe. On December 9, Josephine, who instead of returning to Boston had stayed with one of her bridesmaids in New York, sent a 36-line poem to Harry Crosby, who was staying with Caresse at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. The last line of the poem read: On the same day, Harry Crosby wrote his final entry in his journal: =Lovers found dead= On the evening of December 10, 1929, Harry was a no-show for dinner before the theater. Caresse called their friend Stanley Mortimer, whose studio Harry was known to use for his trysts. Stanley found Harry and Josephine's bodies. Harry had a .25 caliber bullet hole in his right temple and lay with his arm around Josephine, who had a matching hole in her left temple, in what appeared to be a suicide pact. =Scandal follows= The next day the headlines revealed all: Tragedy and Disgrace. As Josephine had died at least two hours before Harry, and there was no suicide note, newspapers ran articles for many days speculating about the murder or suicide pact. The New York Times front page blared, \\"COUPLE SHOT DEAD IN ARTISTS' HOTEL; Suicide Compact Is Indicated Between Henry Grew Crosby and Harvard Man's Wife. BUT MOTIVE IS UNKNOWN He Was Socially Prominent in Boston‚ÄîBodies Found in Friend's Suite.\\" The New York newspapers decided it was a murder-suicide. Harry's poetry possibly gave the best clue to his motives. Death was \\"the hand that opens the door to our cage the home we instinctively fly to.\\" His manner of death mortified proper Boston society. Caresse continues publishing After Harry Crosby's suicide, Caresse dedicated herself to the Black Sun Press. She published the first edition of Hart Crane's book-length poem The Bridge, replete with tipped-in photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge taken by Walker Evans, his public debut. She followed that by releasing a \\"collected Crosby\\"‚Äîfour books that reprinted earlier collections. One of these collections had been originally introduced by D. H. Lawrence. To accompany it, Caresse solicited essays for the other three from T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Stuart Gilbert. Caresse published two volumes of Harry Crosby's poetry, Chariot of the Sun and Transit of Venus. He had dedicated the latter volume to his lover, Josephine Rotch Bigelow. In 1943, during the Second World War, she designed and published the first English-language edition of the surrealist collaboration between Max Ernst and Paul √âluard book, Misfortunes of the Immortals, first published in 1920. Translated by Hugh Chisholm, it featured newly added content, \\"Three Drawings Twenty Years Later\\", by Ernst. Due to limited availability of quality paper during wartime, it was printed by handset letterpress at the Gemor Press, on \\"exceptionally cheap wartime newsprint.\\" The Black Sun Press broadened its scope after Harry's death. Although it published few works after 1952, it printed James Joyce's Collected Poems in 1963. It did not officially close until Caresse's death on January 24, 1970 at age 78. She had also established, with Jacques Porel, a side venture, Crosby Continental Editions, which published paperback books by European writers including Alain Fournier, Charles-Louis Philippe, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, Paul √âluard, George Grosz, Max Ernst, C. G. Jung and Americans like Ernest Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, William Faulkner, and Kay Boyle, among others. Her paperback books, an innovative product in the 1930s, were not well received, and she closed the press in 1933. Reputation The Black Sun Press is not given much attention in literary history because of the relatively short time period during which they published, and because they were seen as \\"frivolous interlopers\\" in the serious world of literature, what antiquarian books expert and actor Neil Pearson and others have called dilettantes. Later value Neil Pearson, an antiquarian books expert who specializes in the expatriate literary movement of Paris between the wars, commented, \\"If you‚Äôre interested in the best of what came out of Paris at that time, a Black Sun book is the literary equivalent of a Braque or a Picasso painting ‚Äì except it‚Äôs a few thousand pounds, not 20 million.\\" The quality and rarity of the books published by the Black Sun Press places them in high demand by collectors. A first edition of The Bridge by Hart Crane in near fine condition was priced at USD$ (about ‚Ç¨) in 2010 by Royal Books. Only 100 copies were made when Editions Narcisse, later the Black Sun Press, printed in 1928 The Birthday of the Infanta by Oscar Wilde, with illustrations by Alastair. A fine copy was offered in New York during 2010 by Hugh Anson-Cartwright Fine Books for USD$ (or about ‚Ç¨). A near-fine copy of the first English-language edition of Max Ernst's and Paul Eluard's book, Misfortunes of the Immortals, which Caresse published in 1943, was offered for sale in 2010 by Derringer Books for ¬£ (about ‚Ç¨ or $). In February 2014, a bookseller offered a copy of The Escaped Cock by D. H. Lawrence, signed by the author and dedicated \\"To John Vassos\\", for USD$2,500.

Evite was launched in 1998. The website is a free, advertisement- supported service. Evite was co-founded by Al Lieb and Selina Tobaccowala. It was acquired in 2001 by conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp. In 2010, Liberty Media acquired ownership of Evite from IAC.  Usage  An event organizer creates an online invitation through the website via a simple interface. This online invitation is colloquially referred to as \\"an Evite\\". The host enters e-mail addresses of prospective guests and Evite sends e-mails to the guests. Each guest is in one of four categories: \\"Attending\\", \\"Not Attending\\", \\"Maybe\\", and \\"Not yet replied\\". Guests move themselves from the \\"Not yet replied\\" category to one of the three \\"replied\\" categories and can write additional comments.  Features  = Donations = * Hosts can turn any event into a fundraiser for the charity of their choice. * Hosts can track in real time how much money their event has raised. = Reminders = * Hosts may send an automatic reminder e-mail in the days prior to the event. * Hosts can determine through the web site whether a guest has viewed the invitation or not. = Style = The HTML page for the invitation may have various stylistic features chosen by the inviter. These include setting, color, layout, and renaming the four guest categories. = Updates = Hosts may opt to send guests updates when other guests RSVP for the event, or when the event details are changed.  Legal controversy  According to Mashable and Venturebeat, Evite has threatened to sue San Francisco-based startup and competitor Socializr (acquired by Punchbowl.com in November 2010) due to alleged copyright infringement.  Criticism  *Entrepreneur Auren Hoffman wrote a blog post in January 2006 pointing out that Evite had great potential but had not improved for six years.

Gah! And the page everyone clicks to is choked with ads.\\" *Time Magazine named Evite one of their \\"5 Worst Websites\\" and \\"Sites to Avoid\\". *Wired Magazine's February 2008 issue on \\"Why Things Suck\\" includes an article criticizing Evite.

Lolei was the last of the three temples to be built as part of the city of Hariharalaya that once flourished at Roluos, and in 893 the Khmer king Yasovarman I dedicated it to Shiva and to members of the royal family. The name \\"Lolei\\" is thought to be a modern corruption of the ancient name \\"Hariharalaya,\\" which means \\"the city of Harihara.\\" Once an island temple, Lolei was located on an island slightly north of centre in the now dry Indratataka baray,Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, construction of which had nearly been completed under Yasovarman's father and predecessor Indravarman I. Scholars believe that placing the temple on an island in the middle of a body of water served to identify it symbolically with Mount Meru, home of the gods, which in Hindu mythology is surrounded by the world oceans.Jessup, p.77; Freeman and Jacques, pp.202 ff. Site This sandstone carving at Lolei shows a fanged dvarapala armed with a trident standing in an arched doorway. At the level of his elbows, two makara heads face outward. Lolei consists of four brick temple towers grouped together on a terrace. The king build Lolei for his ancestors. One for his grandfather, one for his grandmother, one for his father, and one for his mother. The front two towers are for the males while the two towers at the back are for the females. The two taller towers are for his grandparents while the two shorter towers are for his parents. Originally, the towers were enclosed by an outer wall access through which was through a gopura, but neither wall nor gopura have survived to the present. Today, the temple is next to a monastery, just as in the 9th century it was next to an ashrama.Freeman and Jacques, p.202. The temple towers are known for their decorative elements, including their false doors, their carved lintels, and their carved devatas and dvarapalas who flank both real and false doors. Some of the motifs represented in the lintels and other sandstone carvings are the sky-god Indra mounted on the elephant Airavata, serpent-like monsters called makaras, and multi-headed nagas.

Engers has 5,367 inhabitants. It is highwater-endangered by its direct contact with the river Rhine.  City history  9th Armored Division halftracks advance through Engers March 27, 1945 * The eldest evidences for settlements reach back to 800 - 600BC. A cemetery of the Iron Age was discovered nearby Engers. * An important historic event was the military activity under Julius Caesar in 55 BC at the town Urmitz with the goal to punish the Germanic Sicambris. * Around 400 AC a Roman castellum was built. Its ruins can still be seen today. * In 1357, Engers received market rights by German imperator Charles IV. * In 1412, Engers received river tax rights, but they were soon given back to Koblenz because of the adverse position of the Rhine-banks at Engers. * In 1662, the pestilence killed nearly all families of Engers except six of them. Families from the nearby village Reil relocated to Engers afterwards, thus Engers started expanding again. * In 1938, under the Nazi regime Jewish families were banished from Engers. * In 1945, the German army destroyed the Engers-Urmitz bridge (formerly named Kronprinz-Wilhelm-Br√ºcke), ignoring fleeing comrads and civilians still crossing the bridge. * Until 1970, Engers was an independent minor city, but in this year it was forced to become in-municipated as a district of Neuwied. With this act, Engers lost its independence and its city- status. * In 1995, the Ensemble Villa Musica trust of the Engers-chateau opened its own academy of music. In 2003, the state's academy of music of Mainz, the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Mainz, was temporarily relocated to Engers.  Tourist attractions  A well known tourist attractions in the region of Neuwied and Koblenz is the Engers chateau. It was built around 1760 by the aristocrat Johann Philip von Waldersdorff as a summer-residence and hunting lodge. Today it is a popular touristic attraction for its music-events and touristic guidings. The old city hall (built around 1642) and the princely inn \\"Schloss-Schenke\\" (built 1621) are placed directly in front of the Engers chateau. Engers station was built 1869 as an importance junction for passenger and freight transport on the East Rhine Railway between Koblenz and Cologne.  Miscellaneous  Nocturnal guided walkings through the town are conducted twice a month. Their invention was a surprising success. It's an old tradition of hikers using the trail Thuringia‚ÄîRhine to throw little stones from Thuringia into the Rhine at the Engers banks.

The name was taken from the Biblical Book of Judges (13:25): \\"And the spirit of the Lord began to move him (Samson) at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\\" History =Biblical era= Tzora is located about 2km south-west of Tel Tzora, which is where the Palestinian village of Sar'a stood until it was depopulated during the 1948 war. Tel Tzora is the likely location of the biblical village of Zorah.Conder and Kitchener, Survey of Western Palestine (vol. III), London 1883, p. 26 =Second Temple era= A ritual bath dating back to the Second Temple Period was discovered near Tzora kibbutz during an archaeological excavation conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority in 2011.Ritual bath dating to the Second Temple Period discovered near Kibbutz Zor'a, 20 October 2011, accessed 13 November 2016 =Modern era= The kibbutz was founded in December 1948 by former Palmach members. It is located on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Dayr Aban. In the 1980s a ham radio club operated under the call 4Z4YJ.http://www.cqww.com/cq-ww-ssb-2009-logs/ee2w/ee2w.log In the early 2000s, Tzora underwent a privatization of its communal living structure, with a community tax levied on income and the residual retained as income by members. In April 2008, the kibbutz was fully privatized. Economy One of the main branches of the kibbutz economy was Tzora Furniture Ltd., which began in 1957 as a metal factory. At first, the company produced bicycles, but in 1974 it began to manufacture office chairs, before moving on to a full range of office furniture. However, the factory burned down in July 2007. In 1993, Tzora opened the first kibbutz winery, Tzora Vineyards, which produces 80,000 bottles of wine a year, of which 15,000 are exported.Boutique revolution puts Israeli wines on world map Best Vintage Tzora is also home to the Teperberg Winery.

He is the father of rock and roll musician and record producer Kim Fowley.https://metv.com/stories/the-hobo-of-the-andy-griffith-show-actually- lost-his-teeth-serving-in-world-war-ii Early years Fowley was born in The Bronx in New York City. He began acting while attending St. Francis Xavier Military Academy. He later attended Los Angeles City College. Fowley began as a singing waiter and then worked as a copy boy for The New York Times, a runner for a Wall Street broker, a United States Postal Service employee, a barker, a salesman, a professional football player, and finally a professional actor. Military service Fowley's enlistment in the United States Navy during World War II led to his being wounded when he served on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean.Steven Jay Rube, Combat Films (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2011), p. 28 He was aboard an aircraft carrier when an explosion knocked out his teeth. The dental setback hardly slowed his career as an actor. In fact, he ended up portraying one of the most well-known dentists in American history. \\"I had a false upper plate, having lost my upper teeth prematurely in mid-life,\\" he explained to Western Clippings in 1994. \\"I started playing old character roles by removing my false upper plate, adding a beard, voice and gait to match my interpretation.\\"https://metv.com/stories/the-hobo-of-the-andy-griffith-show- actually-lost-his-teeth-serving-in-world-war-ii  Film  After nightclub performing and stage work, Fowley appeared in 1933 in his first film, The Mad Game, alongside Spencer Tracy. Early in his acting career, he was usually cast as a movie heavy or gangster in B-movies, including Charlie Chan and Laurel and Hardy features. Fowley's films include Twenty Mule Team, Fall Guy, Mighty Joe Young, Angels in the Outfield, Battleground, Armored Car Robbery, Chick Carter, Detective, The Naked Jungle, The High and the Mighty, and Walking Tall.  Television  =Regular cast= For several seasons, Fowley played the key supporting role of John H. \\"Doc\\" Holliday in the 1955-1961 western television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp after having appeared as Doc Fabrique in the show's premiere season. This role allowed Fowley to demonstrate his flair for comedy and other acting skills as a clever, sharp- witted, sardonic, cynical, alcoholic, poker-playing foil to the square-jawed, milk-drinking, church-going Wyatt Earp (Hugh O'Brian), whom Holiday nicknamed \\"Deacon\\" due to his rigid sense of morality. Not at all so encumbered Doc would occasionally take the law into his own hands behind Earp's back to protect his friend from legal action or even death when the marshal was legally or morally ham-strung. Holliday, as played by Fowley, having no problem working around morals or the law, could be either hilarious or cold- blooded.https://metv.com/stories/the-hobo-of-the-andy-griffith-show-actually- lost-his-teeth-serving-in-world-war-ii From 1966 to 1967, Fowley portrayed Andrew Hanks in Pistols 'n' Petticoats, a CBS sitcom. Hanks was the patriarch in a family of gun-toting women who seemed to have little need for male assistance. Fowley portrayed retired businessman Robert Redford in Detective School (1979). = Guest appearances = In the 1950s, he appeared as himself on NBC's The Donald O'Connor Show. In 1954, he demonstrated his comic appeal when he appeared alongside Gracie Allen in The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. He was cast in 1956 as Bob Egan in the \\"Two-Fisted Saint\\" episode of the religious anthology series Crossroads. He portrayed a con man in two episodes of the NBC sitcom It's a Great Life. He also guest-starred on Reed Hadley's CBS legal drama The Public Defender. He appeared, too, on the ABC situation comedy The Pride of the Family and on the NBC Western series The Californians and Jefferson Drum. He was cast on two Rod Cameron series, the syndicated City Detective and the Western-themed State Trooper, and in John Bromfield's series, U.S. Marshal. He guest-starred in the David Janssen crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective and guest-starred in season two, episode four of the Robert Culp Western Trackdown. In 1959, Fowley appeared with Frank Ferguson in the episode \\"A Race for Life\\" of the CBS Western series The Texan, starring Rory Calhoun. In 1964, Fowley made a guest appearance on the CBS courtroom drama series Perry Mason playing agent Rubin Cason in \\"The Case of the Bountiful Beauty\\". In 1965, he was cast as Sorrowful in episode 83 of the series The Virginian. In 1966, he appeared as \\"Rufus C. Hoops\\" in \\"The Search\\" season 2, episode 24, of the series \\"Daniel Boone\\". Original air date for this episode was March 3, 1966. In 1967, Fowley guest-starred on the short-lived CBS Western Dundee and the Culhane with John Mills. In 1968, he appeared in episode 273 of My Three Sons as an old pal of Uncle Charley's. He had a role in the syndicated 1959-1960 Western Pony Express in the episode \\"Showdown at Thirty Mile Ridge\\". He was cast in 1963 in Miracle of the White Stallions. Fowley was usually typecast as a villain; when not playing an actual criminal, he often portrayed an argumentative troublemaker. Portraying a member of Tyrone Power's orchestra in Alexander's Ragtime Band, in the early scenes of the film, Fowley's character quarrels with his bandmates, but this is not developed in the film's later scenes. Fowley continued to act into the 1970s and was frequently billed as \\"Douglas V. Fowley\\". One of his last roles was as Delaney Rafferty in Disney's The North Avenue Irregulars, in which he dressed in drag.  Death  Fowley died nine days before what would have been his 87th birthday. He was buried at the Murrieta, California, Laurel Cemetery.

He was also the director of the Agricultural ministry's Resettlement office in 1944‚Äì1959 and was responsible for the resettlement of the farmers evacuated from the ceded Karelia. Later he was a department director at the Board of Customs. Vennamo was born in Jaakkima, Ladoga Karelia, now in Russia. He was one of the loudest and most prominent critics of President Kekkonen. He also criticized the centre-left governments of the 1960s and 1970s for worsening the living conditions of small farmers and poor workers, for example by favouring the big cities at the expense of the rural towns in abolishing small schools and grocery stores. Vennamo became famous for using simple slogans (kyll√§ kansa tiet√§√§!, \\"the people do know!\\") and catchphrases, some of which became popular terms such as \\"the forgotten people\\" and r√∂t√∂sherra (a pejorative for corrupted politicians). He was a presidential candidate in 1968, 1978 and 1982. In the 1968 presidential election, he negatively surprised President Kekkonen and his centre-left allies by getting 11% of the votes. The populist Rural Party got 9% of the deputies in the 1970 and 1972 parliamentary elections, and 8.5% of the deputies in the 1983 parliamentary elections. Vennamo's autocratic manner of leading his party caused the majority of the newly elected Rural Party MPs to defect and form a new party called Finnish People's Unity Party in 1972. Vennamo also encouraged his parliamentary group to make hundreds of bills for the legislature. He became more notorious when he had to be carried out from a parliamentary session by the janitors after defying the speaker's orders in 1974. After the 1983 elections, the Rural Party was allowed to join the government, but Vennamo preferred not to become a cabinet minister. In the 1988 presidential election, he supported the reelection of President Mauno Koivisto.

Early life Michell was the son of John Michell (pronounced Mitchell), a miner, and his wife Grace, n√©e Rowse and was born at Maldon, Victoria. His parents had migrated from Devonshire in 1854. Educated at first at Maldon, he went to Wesley College, Melbourne, in 1877, where he won the Draper and Walter Powell scholarships. In 1881 he began the arts course at the University of Melbourne, and qualified for the B.A. degree at the end of 1883. He had an outstanding course, heading the list with first-class honours each year, and winning the final honour scholarship in mathematics and physics. Michell then went to the University of Cambridge, obtained a major scholarship at Trinity College, and was bracketed senior wrangler with three others in the first part of the mathematical tripos in 1887. In the second part of the tripos in 1888, Michell was placed in division one of the first class. University of Melbourne Michell was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1890, but returned to Melbourne later the same year, and was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Melbourne University. He held this position for over 30 years. His academic work occupied so much of his time that it was difficult to do original research. The first of his papers, \\"On the theory of free streamlines\\", which appeared in Transactions of the Royal Society in 1890, had drawn attention to his ability as a mathematician, and during the following 12 years about 15 papers were contributed to English mathematical journals. It was recognized that these were important contributions to the knowledge of hydrodynamics and elasticity, and in June 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), London. The number of his students at the University steadily increased, but there was no corresponding staff increase for a long while. Michell continued his research work but none of it was published. In 1923 he became professor of mathematics and, obtaining some increase of staff, established practice-classes and tutorials, thus considerably improving the efficiency of his department. Michell resigned the chair at the end of 1928 and was given the title of honorary research professor. He died after a short illness on 3 February 1940 at Camberwell. Michell did not marry. Michell published The Elements of Mathematical Analysis (1937), a substantial work in two volumes written in collaboration with Maurice Belz. Legacy Michell was regarded as a shy man and was one of the earliest graduates of an Australian university to be elected to the Royal Society. He was a good teacher, good- natured and patient with students, but his heart was really in his research work. His assistance was freely given to his engineering friends in clearing up their problems, and he did a good deal of physical experimentation including the devising and construction of several new forms of gyroscopes. He was continually at work, and it is not known why he did not choose to publish any papers after 1902. The value of his paper on \\"The wave resistance of a ship\\", published in 1898, was not realized until some 30 years later, when both English and German designers began to recognize its importance. Michell's brother, Anthony Michell (born 1870) made significant contributions to mechanical science, including the famous Michell thrust bearing. During a relatively short research career, Michell published 23 scientific papers that are some of the most important contributions ever made by an Australian mathematician. A mini-symposium has held at the 3rd Biennial Engineering Mathematics and Applications Conference (EMAC '98) celebrating the centenary of the publication of Michell's famous 1898 paper on ship hydrodynamics, The wave resistance of a ship, Phil.

R. Baalu assumes the charge of Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport and Highways in New Delhi on May 26, 2004 Baalu is one of the prominent leaders to work towards the implementation of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project. He was handling it during his tenure as the minister of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways.Gaur, p. 171 The project proposes linking the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar between India and Sri Lanka by creating a shipping canal through the shallow sea sometimes called Setu Samudram, and through the chain of islands variously known as Ram Sethu or the Adam's Bridge. A few organisations are opposing the dredging of Ramasethu on religious, environmental and economical grounds. Many of these parties and organisations support implementation of this project using one of the five alternative alignments considered earlier without damaging the structure considered sacred by Hindus. During 2006, the Supreme Court Baalu quashed a case requesting a ban on the project and issues notices to Baalu and the environment ministry.Gaur 2006, p. 198 With 22 km of dredging remaining, the project is held from March 2010 by a Supreme Court order seeking the Central Government to clarify the status of the bridge as a national monument. He was recruited as a minister in 2009 during the second term on UPA coalition government as it was reported that the Prime Minister was unhappy with Baalu over the corruption charges in Sethusamudram project. But he continued as the head of the DMK parliamentary party and also part of various central committees. DMK pulled out of the ruling UPA on 20 March 2013 following widespread protests in Tamil Nadu against the central government for not taking up the concerns of Tamils in Sri Lanka in the UN resolution against the alleged human rights violation against Tamils by Sri Lankan government. There was a brief controversy when Azhagiri did not accompany the contigency led by Baalu, the head of MPs from the DMK party, to tender resignation in the Prime minister's office and to hand over the letter of withdrawal to the President on 20 March 2013. It was claimed as a mark of protest against his father Karunanidhi's decision to pull out from the central ministry. Some sources claim he delayed his resignation as he was not kept in the loop while taking the decision and snubbed Baalu. The fifth Joint parliamentary committee was constituted in February 2011 to probe 2G case. It is headed by P.C. Chacko and had 30 members, 15 each from the ruling UPA and opposition members belonging to BJP, JD (U), CPI, CPM, Trinamool Congress, BJD, DMK and the AIADMK in the 30-member panel accused P.C. Chacko of being \\"partisan\\" and demanded his removal (They submitted a memorandum to the Lok Sabha Speaker expressing their \\"no-confidence\\".) Three of the DMK MPs, namely, A. Raja, the IT and Telecommunication minister, Kanimozhi, the daughter of Karunanidhi and Rajya Sabha MP and Dayanidhi Maran, the nephew and IT and Telecommunication minister preceding A. Raja, are the three accused in the scam. Baalu is the only member from the DMK in the committee and he, along with other opposition members, snubbed the report as \\"half boiled\\" as the draft report gave a clean chit to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P Chidambaram, while implicating the DMK minister A. Raja.

Dreyer plans to make an estimated 31 crossings totalling of the Straits of Mackinac. Dubbed \\"Dire Straits 125\\", the feat is estimated to take 84 to 96 hours. Through his swimming projects he tries to raise funds and awareness for the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Jim is now living in Batesville, IN and successfully selling real estate.

They started the trend of NFL cheerleading squads having young attractive women in revealing outfits dancing in front of fans.  History  = 1960s = The original cheerleading squad was made up of a male-female group called the \\"CowBelles & Beaux\\". The group made its sidelines debut in 1960 during the Cowboys' inaugural season. Local high school students made up the squad, which was typical of high school and college cheerleading squads throughout the 1960s, rarely getting much attention. During a game between the Cowboys and the Atlanta Falcons at the Cotton Bowl during the 1967 season,Shropshire, 1997 pg. 118 the scantily clad, well-endowed Bubbles Cash, a stripper by profession, caused a tremendous stir in the crowd that turned to cheers when she walked down the staircase stands on the 50-yard line carrying cotton candy in each hand.Shropshire, 1997 pg. 119 She became an instant public sensation in Dallas, also gaining attention from Cowboys General Manager Tex Schramm. Understanding the importance of the entertainment industry to the Cowboys' profitability, Schramm was inspired to form a cheerleading squad dressed in similar fashion to Cash. By 1969, it was decided that the cheerleading squad needed this new image. The male cheerleaders were dropped from the squad, and an all-female squad from local high school cheerleading squads in the Dallas- Fort Worth area was selected. From that point on, the \\"CowBelles & Beaux\\" became the \\"Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\\", with new members added every year. = 1970s = Preparing for the 1970 season, Schramm decided to change the Cheerleaders' image to boost attendance. At first the main change was to create an all-female squad and change the uniforms and style of cheerleading routines to be primarily dance and less like traditional acrobatic routines like that of high school or college cheerleading squads. The ten local high school cheerleaders who were selected for the 1970 season were also involved in the task of totally redesigning the uniforms and creating new dance style cheer routines under Dee Brock's direction and with the help of a choreographer. In 1971, the qualification rules changed to allow not only local female cheerleaders to compete for a spot on the squad, but also high school drill team officers. Then in 1972, Texie Waterman, a New York choreographer, was recruited and assigned to auditioning and training an entirely new female squad who would all be over 18 years of age, searching for attractive appearance, athletic ability, and raw talent as performers. Since the 1972 squad consisted of adults, this allowed the possibility of again redesigning the uniforms to introduce a more revealing look (most notably transitioning from the traditional cheerleader skirt to hot pants) closer to the classic DCC image that is known today. This modified squad first appeared on the sidelines during the Cowboys' 1972 season. Even greater national attention came in the fall of 1977 when the Cowboys, along with designer and photographer Bob Shaw, produced the first NFL cheerleader poster for the Dallas Cowboys. This, and an Esquire magazine article by Shaw in October 1977, led to the squad appearing on two network TV specials, NBC Rock-n-Roll Sports Classic and The Osmond Brothers Special on ABC. Also that year, the DCC produced their own one-hour special, The 36 Most Beautiful Girls in Texas, which aired on ABC prior to the season opener of Monday Night Football (which coincidentally was a game that the Cowboys hosted). On 14 January, 1979, the made-for-TV movie The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders aired. Starring Bert Convy and Jane Seymour, it had a 48% share of the national television audience. = 1980s = Howitzer. On 13 January, 1980, a sequel to the original TV movie, The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders II, aired. The Cheerleaders have made many other TV appearances since then, and their likeness has been featured on various merchandise, such as posters, T-shirts, trading cards, and calendars. The DCC has also toured throughout the United States (on and off the field), as well as overseas. Included in these tours are regular appearances in United Service Organizations (USO) tours, which began during the 1979 holiday season for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. = 1990s = The DCC releases several calendars every year. More recently, in addition to their annual swimsuit calendar, they also release an annual \\"sideline calendar,\\" featuring photos of the DCC cheering and performing at Cowboys home games. The DCC held a ceremony inaugurating the second game of the 1994 FIFA World Cup between Spain and South Korea. Former DCCs Kelli McGonagill Finglass and Judy Trammell became the squad's director and choreographer, respectively. =2000s - present = Since 2006, the Cheerleaders have produced their own reality television series, Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team, which airs on Country Music Television (CMT) during the NFL football season. The series follows the auditioning process of the annual squad. The DCC received the FIFA delegation to promote the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The DCC also held an opening ceremony and podium at the 2013 and 2018 United States Grand Prix races in Austin, Texas. Uniform The uniform itself is a carefully guarded trademark and may not be duplicated in any way without the written permission of the DCC. The internationally recognized ensemble of a blue blouse, a white fringed vest with blue stars, and white hot pants with a white belt with blue stars was originally designed by Paula Van Waggoner.Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Executive Office =Modifications= Since first introduced with the formation of the squad in 1972, the basic uniform has been modified only six times: * In May 1989, the original \\"go-go\\" boot had gone out of style, and a more western oriented design was selected. * In 1991, the large buckled belt was left behind in favor of shorts with a more flattering cut. * In 1992, a cowboy- style boot was introduced to the uniform. * In 1993, crystals were added to outline the 15 stars on the vest and shorts. * In 1994, a more western shape to the blouse lapels was incorporated. * In 1999, crystals were added to the fringe line of the vest. * In 2002, a western styled belt with a large buckle was added to the shorts. Each modification has been approved by Director Kelli McGonagill Finglass and implemented by Leveta Crager, who for 24 years made and hand tailored every uniform worn by a DCC. Upon her retirement, at the start of the 1996 season, designer Greg Danison was chosen to continue the tradition of individual craftsmanship. In February 2018, two uniforms worn by former DCCs‚Äîa current-generation uniform and a prior-generation (1970s-80s) uniform‚Äîwere donated to the National Museum of American History (part of the Smithsonian Institution) in Washington, D.C., along with their respective- generation boots and pom-poms. Other items donated include DCC Barbie dolls, a sketch of the DCC uniform, and the DCC's iconic 1977 poster. Off-field television appearances Along with their two TV movies, the DCC has also appeared on numerous TV shows and specials as performers, guest acting roles, and game show contestants. Some of the shows on which they have appeared include: * The Love Boat, Episodes #62 and #63 (Season 3) and #84 (Season 4) ‚Äì One DCC has an unwanted admirer stalking her on the ship. Another is hit on by her mom's fianc√©. As a group, the DCC performs their signature routines. In the Season 4 episode entitled \\"Target Gopher/The Major's Wife/Strange Honeymoon/The Oilman Cometh Target Gopher\\", a Texas oil magnate takes the DCC aboard to impress his clients, including a Mideast prince who thinks one of the women has been given to him. Also on board are two brothers in the honeymoon suite, and an Air Force officer, his passive wife, and an aggressive ex-girlfriend. * Family Feud ‚Äì Five of the DCC participated as a team on a celebrity special for charity against five of the Cowboys players on the week of 30 June ‚Äì 4 July 1980. * Harry and the Hendersons ‚Äì Guest appearance * Billy Bob's New Year Special on CBS - Guest appearance * Nashville Palace (Halloween special, October 1981) ‚Äì The DCC appeared as guests alongside various country music artists, such as Mickey Gilley and the Oak Ridge Boys. * Hard Knocks (2002) - Guest appearance * Saturday Night Live - Guest appearance * The Tonight Show with Jay Leno - Guest appearance * Late Show with David Letterman - Guest appearance * I Can Do That - They performed with Cheryl Burke and Nicole Scherzinger. * Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? - They participated on a celebrity special for charity in 2008. * The DCC have also appeared on a number of country music awards shows and specials since the late 1970s. The squad also produces its own reality television series Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team, which aired for each season since 2006. The series, which airs on CMT during the NFL season, chronicles the audition process and performer selection for each season's squad.

The main issues the play addresses are violence, specifically domestic violence, and the abuse of power and authority. The story is supposed to be a microcosm of 1970s Australian society. It was adapted into a Margaret Fink- produced film in 1975, starring Peter Cummins as Simmonds, John Hargreaves as Ross, Kate Fitzpatrick as Kate, Jacki Weaver as Fiona, Martin Harris as Kenny, and Chris Haywood as the Removalist. Plot The play begins in a police station in a crime-ridden suburb in Melbourne, Australia, where Constable Neville Ross, just out of police training and ready for his first placement, meets old and experienced Sergeant Dan Simmonds. Set in a time of radical change in Australian society, Simmonds is revealed to be very chauvinistic, a great juxtaposition from Ross' nervous character. He is also hesitant to reveal to Simmonds his father's career as coffin maker. While being verbally tested by Simmonds, two women enter the station, Kate Mason and Fiona Carter, who are sisters. Mason is a stuck-up, authoritative woman, who married well, whereas Carter is nervous and timid. Kate reveals that Fiona's husband Kenny has been abusing her, to which Simmonds suggests that Ross take the job. Kate is displeased, strongly disagrees, and demands that Simmonds personally takes their case. She says that the bruises are on Fiona's back and thigh, which Simmonds inspects personally, and even takes a photograph of (he says that a view by the \\"medically un-trained eye\\" would look good on the police report). Before setting out, Fiona tells them that there is furniture which she paid for that needs to be taken before Kenny is apprehended. She suggests taking them while he is at the pub with his friends. Simmonds is keen to assist the women with the removal of the furniture because he sees the possibility of sexual reward. The next act takes place in Fiona and Kenny's apartment; though Kenny gets home before the furniture removalist arrives. Fiona tries to get him to leave, but he becomes suspicious. Kate then arrives. Kenny finally decides to go to the pub as usual but then, the removalist knocks on the door, which Kenny answers. He becomes agitated when the removalist assures him that he was called to the address. Kenny slams the door on him, but there is another knock, which is revealed to be Simmonds and Ross. Kenny is handcuffed to the door, while Ross and the removalist begin to take the furniture. After repeated verbal abuse from Kenny, Simmonds beats him, to the distress of Fiona. Simmonds picks out from subtle hints in Kate and Fiona's talk that Kate is a repeat adulterer, which he calls her out on and begins to berate her with. She becomes agitated and leaves, but Simmonds follows her and continues to argue; Fiona follows as well. Meanwhile, Ross uncuffs Kenny to take him to the station, but after lengthy insults, Ross loses it and severely beats Kenny. They run into another room, where violent acts are heard. Ross exits, with signs of blood on him, and looking distressed. Simmonds comes back alone, with the sister having taken a taxi to her new apartment, and finds Ross begging for help, as he believes Kenny to be dead. After inspecting, he agrees, and the two begin distraughtly thinking of suggestions for a justified murder. As they do, Kenny crawls out, severely beaten but barely stable. Ross and Simmonds are alerted to his presence when he lights a cigarette. Ross is relieved, but Simmonds does not agree with the suggestion that he be brought to a hospital; instead, he bargains with Kenny with the lure of a prostitute for the assurance that he would keep the incident quiet. Kenny agrees, but after a few moments, he suddenly falls on the floor and dies. Ross again becomes distressed and agitated, he then punches Simmonds in the hope that it would look as if he assaulted the officers. The play ends with the two policemen desperately punching each other. Characters There are six characters in the play. There are some unseen characters, however, such as a car salesman, Fiona's Mother and Kenny's baby daughter Sophie. =Simmonds= Simmonds is the police sergeant who abuses his power by threatening the new recruit, Ross. He is a chauvinistic hypocrite who has no respect for women, including his own wife and daughter. He sees to satisfy his sexually perverse needs through the pretext of examining his clients, such as Fiona, for marks \\"apparent to the medically untrained eye\\". His clients, usually victims of circumstances, are in desperate need of help. Through the character Simmonds, Williamson shows that the authority conferred upon society can be exploitative and violent. Williamson demonstrates that should abuse occur in a police station and under the witness of policemen, their victims are rendered powerless. Through the portrayal of the policemen as powerful and somewhat uncontrollable in their nature towards the end of the play, Williamson displays and highlights a serious social issue of the time, therefore making it one of his most remembered works. =Ross= Ross is a new recruit who was sent to Simmonds' station after finishing police training. Throughout the play, he is depicted as a naive and inexperienced officer despite coming from an educated background. He is often forced to follow Simmonds constant demands and listen to Simmonds' comments on his own inadequacies. This is shown when Simmonds questions Kenny: \\"Do you think he's (Ross) lacking in initiative?\\" Ross comes across as a nervous character in the beginning of the play, but his violent and uncontrollable behaviour is raised through his sudden, unexpected attack on Kenny, which inevitably led to Kenny's death. =Kate= Kate Mason is married with three children. The wife of a dentist, she enjoys an upper class lifestyle. Her children attend one of Melbourne's \\"better\\" (more exclusive/expensive) schools. Kate forms a feminine mirror to Simmonds. They both like to be in a position of power, which is evident of Kate's controlling of her sister Fiona. Like Simmonds, Kate has been unfaithful to her partner on numerous occasions. =Fiona= Fiona Carter is Kate's sister. Fiona wants to have a separation from her husband Kenny, after being beaten by him, but does not want a divorce. She is a passive housewife and fits into the stereotypical gender roles of 1970s Australia. She is married to Kenny, and has a baby daughter Sophie. Fiona is insecure, vulnerable and hesitant to leave. =Kenny= Kenny is depicted as a \\"larrikin\\" working-class man, and represents the stereotypical egoistic \\"Aussie\\" male of the 1970s. The play's action is instigated by Kenny's beating of his wife Fiona, the reporting of which prompts her visit to Ross and Simmonds's police station, and her move out of their shared home. Kenny is very hot-headed and his vocabulary is vulgar Australian vernacular. The play's major plot twist occurs in the final minutes when Kenny, despite apparently having recovered from a beating by Ross to the point where he begins to negotiate a deal with the two officers, dies suddenly at mid-conversation from a brain hemorrhage. In the end Kenny seems to be the victim. =The Removalist= The Removalist (Rob) is the man who moves the furniture out of Fiona and Kenny's house when they are separating. The Removalist represents the everyman who 'sits on the fence'. His main concern is getting paid for the work, and running off to the next 'job'. He represents another part of Australian society who are passive in times of crisis. The Removalist is a curious character in the play. He plays no role in involving himself in helping others. The only thing we know is that he has 'ten thousand dollars' worth of machinery tickin' over there'. The role of the Removalist, as well as being one of the plays namesakes, is to be a symbol of the outside world, society at the time, and is where the plays meaning grows. He watches the bashing without a worry, sometimes seeing humour in it. The fact that he does not react as the audience does, not even helping Kenny when he is begged, shows a stereotypical society of the time: as long as their own work is done what they witness is not worth the time of day, and generally a blind eye is turned when the police are in power, even if what they are doing is wrong. \\" Sorry mate. I've got a pretty simple philosophy. If there's work I work, if nobody interferes with me then I interfere with nobody.\\" Another way of seeing the Removalist is that he is the only character within the play to be morally good. Everyone else portrayed has a problem and very flawed persona. Simmons is a crooked cop, Ross is too innocent and therefore doesn't know the truth of world. Kate is promiscuous (has sex with a lot of different people), Kenny is abusive, and Fiona is insecure and unable to decide for herself. The Removalist is what someone should be, a worker, doesn't retaliate, is polite, and doesn't have any depicted bad habits or crooked character traits. He only does what he is meant to do, and is lets the people who do their job do their job. Issues The play deals with a lot of issues/themes/concerns and expresses these through the 'new age theatre' that David Williamson engages his audiences through. For the first time Australians were seeing themselves on stage. Symbolically David Williamson explores Australian society through the characters, themes and concerns. For example, \\"The Removalist\\" represents the everyman who 'sits on the fence'. The use of the 'police force' is interesting too ‚Äì it is a blackly humorous pun, given the force and violence that the two police characters use. Violence is a constant theme throughout the play. Words such as 'fuck', 'shit' and 'cunt' are provocative and confronting but also true of the 'ocker' language and mannerisms that Kenny, Ross and Simmonds embody. Background The play is set in 1971 ‚Äì a turbulent time in Australian history and society. In 1956, Melbourne hosted the Olympic Games, and television was launched in Australia. Both these events meant Australians began to see more of the world, and had a different picture of their place in it. In 1962, changes were made enabling the indigenous Aboriginal population to vote. In the same year, the Vietnam War began, which led to an increasing Australian involvement, including the introduction of National service (1964.) In 1964, The Beatles toured Australia. Young girls went crazy, and society changed forever. In 1966, the Australian Labor Party dropped the White Australia policy as part of its platform. 1969 saw Man walk on the moon, and Australian women getting the right to equal pay. In the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, Australian Society was getting more publicly vocal ‚Äì women's right, indigenous rights, protesting against the Vietnam War, etc. With a string of public trials against corruption in the police force, The Removalists is an examination of Australian society at one of its most turbulent times. David Williamson aimed to create an Australian identity in international drama. The Removalists uses generic characters to which the Australian audience can relate. Williamson used familiar issues in his society such as corruption and violence in the police force and reflected them in The Removalists. Williamson was inspired to write the play by a story told to him by a removalist.Williamson, David, Interview with David Williamson, Kunapipi, 1(2), 1979. Available at:https://ro.uow.edu.au/kunapipi/vol1/iss2/18 He later said, \\"the play was actually a very black satire on the very worst aspects of Australian macho, male behaviour, which the audiences, interestingly, read straight away. Audiences are far more intelligent (sorry) than critics. They read what's actually happening there in front of them on the stage, whereas those occasional critics who view life through an ideological framework, they interpreted the play to be a searing attack on police brutality, which it never was.\\" Williamson himself appeared in the La Mama production as the removalist alongside Kristin Green. Both wound up leaving their spouses for each other. Film The play was turned into a 1975 Australian film.

Bharananganam and surrounding places are hilly areas with a lot of vegetation. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people, who cultivate plantation crops such as rubber. Demographics The population of Bharananganam comprises Catholic Syrian Christians and Hindus. The Syrian Christian community here is said to be 1000 years old, who migrated from the nearby Aruvithura area, along the upper course of the Meenachil River, in the 10th and 11th centuries. Also, many other Christian families migrated to the region from other ancient Christian centers in the following centuries. The community traditionally practices farming. Both the Christians and Hindus live in absolute peace and harmony. Recent history Bharananganam is known for its many aristocratic and affluent Nasrani families who've branched out from the place to other agrarian areas of Kerala, following the early agrarian expansion of Central Travancore, in the mid-19th century. This expansion lasted till the 1980s, with the last few waves of migrant Syrian Christians from in and around the area, migrating to the hilly villages of Northern Kerala.  Other major attractions  = Sree Krishna Swami Temple = Bharananaganam is well known for Sree Krishna Temple in the banks of river Meenachil, it is one of the major temples of South Kerala. The east facing Sree Krishna Swami temple is located 1.3 km away from Bharananganam junction in Ettumanoor - Poonjar State Highway. The 8 day long annual festival in Makaram (January) is a very vibrant event in the whole region commencing with the hoisting of the temple flag on Makara Samkramam day, and concluding with ‚ÄòArattu‚Äô (Ritual Bath of the deity) on 8th day. Besides the regular daily rituals the festivities include processions of the deity on elephant‚Äôs back to the suburban villages like Kizhaparayar, Keezhambara, Chittanappara and Bharananganam (on 5 days) the precious ‚ÄòUtsava Bali‚Äô (for 6 days) and art and cultural programs every day. The ‚ÄòArattu‚Äô, typical of the 'Arattu' in almost any temple, is a magnificent night-long ceremony including procession of several elephants and performances by major percussion teams. The slow-moving procession of the caparisoned elephants carrying decorative silken umbrellas and other paraphernalia, illumined by multi-tongued oil torches, is a gorgeous spectacle, a delightful experience for the participants.

The thousand year old St. Mary's Syro-Malabar Catholic Church here is one of the famous pilgrim centers of the Christians in Kerala. Saint Alphonsa is the first woman to be conferred sainthood from the Kerala Church, which traces its origins to the visit of St. Thomas around 2,000 years ago to preach the gospel in India, and the second Indian to get that status after St. Gonsalo Garcia. The death anniversary of Saint Alphonsa, which falls on 28 July is an important day for the devotees. Every year on this day, thousands of devotees visit this holy shrine, where the mortal remains of the saint is preserved, to pray and seek her blessings. Saint Alphonsa's tomb Saint Alphonsa lived a saintly life and was recognized as a saintly person during her lifetime. Even at a young age she showed a great zeal for suffering and she used to pray fervently and longed for sacrifice and fasting as and when possible. She believed that she must endure all things that tests her will and offer them to the Lord. It is said that in spite of her painful diseases, she was cheerful to the last. It was her students who established the cult of Saint Alphonsa. After her death, they began visiting her tomb and offering prayers. As they continued, they started receiving favours. Ever since, her tomb has been a centre of pilgrimage and innumerable miracles. The first officially confirmed miracle was that of, a disabled child miraculously cured of his ailment and his limbs restored, due to prayers at the altar of Sister Alphonsa's shrine. The miracle was approved in 1985 and the beatification of Sister Alphonsa was proclaimed by Pope John Paul II, during his visit to India in 1986. There is a two floored structure in front of the shrine which was originally the Papal podium for the beatification ceremony on 8 Feb.1986. Sister Alphonsa became Saint Alphonsa after she was canonised by Pope Benedict XVI at a ceremony at St. Peter's Square, Vatican City on 12 October 2008. The Clarist convent where Sr. Alphonsa lived is located near St. Mary's Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane Church in Bharananganam. There is a museum adjacent to the convent chapel where the personal belongings of the Saint are well preserved.

Among other areas, he specialized in studying gamelan music from Indonesia. Hood pioneered, in the 1950s and 1960s, a new approach to the study of music, and the creation of the first American university program devoted to ethnomusicology, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He was known for a suggestion, somewhat novel at the time, that his students learn to play the music they were studying. Biography Born and raised in Springfield, Illinois, Hood studied piano as a child and played clarinet and tenor saxophone in regional jazz clubs in his teens. Despite his talent as a musician, he had no plans to make it his profession. He moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s and wrote pulp fiction while employed as a draftsman in the aeronautical industry. After Army service in Europe during World War II, he returned to Los Angeles. He enrolled in the School of Agriculture at the University of California before transferring to UCLA. Between 1945 and 1950 Mantle Hood studied Western music under composer Ernst Toch and composed several classical pieces. Hood earned both his BA in music and MA in composition from UCLA in 1951. As a Fulbright scholar, Hood studied Indonesian music under Jaap Kunst at the University of Amsterdam. He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on pathet, translated as the modal system of Central Javanese music. He proposed that the contours of the balungan (nuclear theme) melody are the primary determinants of Javanese musical modes. The dissertation, The Nuclear Theme as a Determinant of Patet in Javanese Music was published in 1954. After completing his doctoral work in 1954, Hood spent two years in Indonesia doing field research funded by a Ford Foundation fellowship. He joined the faculty at UCLA where he established the first gamelan performance program in the United States in 1958. He also founded the Institute for Ethnomusicology at UCLA in 1960. UCLA quickly became an important American hub of this rapidly developing field. Hood's work spawned a legion of teachers and leaders of the more than 100 gamelan groups in the United States today. A renowned expert in Javanese and Balinese music and culture, Hood received honors from the Indonesian government for his research, among them the conferral of the title Ki (literally \\"the venerable\\") in 1986, and in 1992 was one of the first non-Indonesians to be honored with membership into the Dharma Kusuma (Society of National Heroes). Hood wrote numerous novels, scholarly books and articles in journals and encyclopedias. Some of his works include The Ethnomusicologist (1971, 1982), Music in Indonesia (1972), the three- volumed The Evolution of Javanese Gamelan. In 1973, Hood left UCLA and retired to Hawaii where he composed music and served as an editor of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. He also wrote contributions for the Harvard Dictionary of Music and the Encyclopedie de la Musique. In the 1980s, he came out of retirement in Hawaii to become Senior Distinguished Professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where he remained until 1996, establishing an ethnomusicology program. He was a professor of music at West Virginia University and a visiting professor at Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan, Queen's University Belfast, Indiana, and Drake Universities and the University of Ghana. He also served as President of the Society for Ethnomusicology from 1965 to 1967. In 1999 he was the Charles Seeger Lecturer at the annual conference of the SEM. Mantle Hood's wife, Hazel Chung, was a teacher of Indonesian and African dance. Hood, with Chung, shot footage in Ghana and Nigeria for their film, Atumpan: The Talking Drums of Ghana (1964). In 1990, Mantle Hood presented a paper at the 7th International Congress of the European Seminar in Ethnomusicology in Berlin under the title \\"The Quantum Theory of Music.\\" The concept sought to revolutionize research in music by developing theoretical and practical constructs to close a 75-year gap between the 1920s, which were the beginning of the quantum age in the sciences, and the present. An international consortium was formed (England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United States). This consortium resulted in an interdisciplinary five-day workshop with the keynote paper on this subject held in Trieste, Italy, including scholars in physics, mathematics, acoustics, computer-based musical composition, and ethnomusicology. In the following year, seminars in ethnomusicology were held in Venice, Italy. In subsequent years, a core group continued to explore new paradigms inspired by Hood's concepts, and worked through correspondence and meetings. The group included Giovanni Giuriati of the University of Rome, Rudiger Schumacher of the University of Cologne, John E. Myers of Bard College at Simon's Rock, and others. Schumacher and Myers delivered related papers at the annual conference of the European Seminar in Ethnomusicology, held in Barcelona, Spain, September 20‚Äì25, 1993. In 1999, Hood outlined key principles of his quantum theory - influenced thinking in his paper \\"Ethnomusicology's Bronze Age in Y2K,\\" delivered as the Seeger Lecture at the congress of the Society for Ethnomusicology held in Austin, Texas. Hood died in Ellicott City, Maryland. His son Made Mantle Hood is also an ethnomusicologist who taught at The University of Melbourne in Australia. and the Universiti Putra Malaysia.  Bi-musicality  Mantle Hood explained ethnomusicology as being the \\"study of music wherever and whenever.\\" While his teacher Jaap Kunst wrote the two volumes of Music in Java without actually playing any of the music, Hood required that his students learn to play the music they were studying. While Hood was not the first ethnomusicologist to attempt learning to perform the music being studied, he gave the approach a name in his 1960 article on bi- musicality. It has been an important ethnomusicological research tool ever since. The approach enables the researcher to, in some manner, learn about music \\"from the inside\\", and thereby experience its technical, conceptual and aesthetic challenges. The student is also able to better connect socially with the community being studied and have better access to the community's rituals and performances. The inspiration of \\"bi-musical\\" was \\"bi-lingual\\". Hood applied the term to music the same way a linguist would when describing someone who spoke two languages. He also strongly proposed that musicology students should know the spoken language of the musical culture being studied. This led to the breakdown of the steadfast rule of having to have competence in French and German at many musicology programs. Now Javanese, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Navajo, Finnish, Quechua, Korean or any other topic- relevant language can fulfill foreign-language requirements.  Quotations  \\"This emphasis upon music as communication, human understanding, and world peace, not only through musical performance, but also through research, teaching, and other forms of dissemination, is one of the greatest gifts Mantle Hood has given to ethnomusicology.\\"Dale Olsen, \\"Encomium for Mantle Hood\\", SEM Newsletter, Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 4, May 2005.

Sandford) *Gino Corrado ‚Äì Aramis Production background The 1929 part-talkie version, titled The Iron Mask, was the first talking picture starring Douglas Fairbanks, though until recently it was usually shown in a silent version. The film stars Fairbanks as d'Artagnan, Marguerite De La Motte as his beloved Constance (who is killed early in the film to protect the secret that the King has a twin brother), Nigel De Brulier as the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, and Ullrich Haupt as the evil Count De Rochefort. William Bakewell appeared as the royal twins. Fairbanks lavished resources on his final silent film, with the knowledge he was bidding farewell to his beloved genre. This marks the only time where Fairbanks's character dies at the end of the film, with the closing scene depicting the once-again youthful Musketeers all reunited in death, moving on (as the final title says) to find \\"greater adventure beyond\\". The original 1929 release, though mostly a silent film, actually had a soundtrack: two short speeches delivered by Fairbanks, and a musical score with a few sound effects. In 1952, it was reissued, with the intertitles removed and a narration voiced by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. added. The original film included a scene in which d'Artagnan tells the young King of an embarrassing adventure involving him and the three musketeers. The story is told in flashback but the 1952 version has it in chronological order with the scene with the King cut out. In 1999, with the cooperation of the Library of Congress and the Museum of Modern Art, Kino Video released a DVD of the 1929 version. A complete set of Vitaphone disks exists for this picture. However, only a small portion of the original sound from these was synchronized with film footage, namely the two short sequences in which Douglas Fairbanks speaks. The rest of the soundtrack, which contained a Synchronized Score along with sound effects was not used as this would make the DVD public domain. (The copyright has expired on the original 1929 sound version.) For this DVD reissue, therefore, a new score was commissioned from composer Carl Davis. The Kino disc also includes excerpts from the 1952 version, some outtakes from the original filming, and some textual background material from the program for the 1999 premiere showing of the reconstruction. A complete restoration of the original sound version has yet to be released. Reception and legacy Fairbanks Biographer Jeffrey Vance has opined, \\"As a valedictory to the silent screen, The Iron Mask is unsurpassed. In one of his few departures from playing a young man‚Äîand with fewer characteristic stunts‚ÄîFairbanks conjures up his most multi- dimensional and moving screen portrayal in a film that is perhaps the supreme achievement of its genre.\\"Vance, Jeffrey (2008).

He built a house on Mauritzgatan 6 in Kruununhaka in Helsinki for his wife and two children in 1901. Since the early 1930s it is the seat of Svenska Klubben. During the civil war in Finland, his Scottish wife, Violet McHutchen, saw Russian officers being executed in a park the near their home. Shocking war experiences forced the family to move to London, where Ossian Donner became the Finland's Representative and later became Charg√© d'affaires to the United Kingdom in 1919. During the √Öland Islands dispute, he was also Finland's Special Envoy at the League of Nations. He held a speech against the Soviet Union which ended his diplomatic career. He was released from Finland as Envoy to London in 1925. After that, he settled permanently in England and gained British citizenship. Ossian Donner belonged to the Donner family. He was the son of Professor Otto Donner, grandson of Anders Donner and brother of the linguist and right-wing activist Kai Donner. The British Conservative MP Patrick Donner was Ossian's son. Donner is buried at the St Andrew's Church cemetery in Hurstbourne Priors Civil Parish in Basingtoke and Deane Borough in Hampshire, England.

It was developed by Alfred Ely Beach in 1869 as a demonstration subway line running on pneumatic power. The subway line had one stop in the basement of the Rogers Peet Building and a one-car shuttle going back and forth. It was not a regular mode of transportation, and lasted from 1870 until 1873. History Alfred Ely Beach demonstrated a model of basic pneumatic subway system, in which air pressure in the tube pushed the cars, at the American Institute Exhibition in New York in 1867. After demonstrating that the model was viable, in 1869 Beach and his Beach Pneumatic Transit Company began constructing a pneumatically powered subway line beneath Broadway. Funneled through a company he set up, Beach put up $350,000 of his own money to pay for the full-scale test project.\\"Inventor of the Week - Alfred Beach\\" (MIT) Built with a tunneling shield, the tunnel was complete in only 58 days. Its single tunnel, long, in diameter, was completed in 1870 and ran under Broadway from Warren Street to Murray Street. However, one of the city's top politicians of the day, William \\"Boss\\" Tweed, refused to support the project. With no initial political support for the project, Beach started the project by claiming he was building postal tubes. The initial permit was to install a pair of smaller postal tubes below Broadway; however, Tweed later amended the permit to allow the excavation of a single large tunnel, wherein the smaller tubes could reside.\\"The remarkable pneumatic people mover\\" on Damn Interesting The exact location of the tubes was determined during construction by compass and survey as well as verified by driving jointed rods of iron up through the roof of the tunnel to the pavement.\\"To excavate the Earth\\" (Columbia University) The line was built as a demonstration of a pneumatic transit system, open to the public with a 25-cent fare per person. Proceeds for the admission went to the Union Home and School for Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans. It was planned to run about in total, to Central Park, if it were ever completed. For the public, the project was used as an attraction. It ran only a single car on its one-block-long track to a dead-end at its terminus, and passengers would simply ride out and back, to see what the proposed subway might be like. During its first two weeks of operation, the Beach Pneumatic Transit sold over 11,000 rides, and over 400,000 total rides in its single year of operation.\\"The Secret Subway\\" (PBS) Although the public showed initial approval, Beach was delayed in getting permission to expand it due to official obstruction for various reasons. By the time he finally gained permission in 1873, public and financial support had waned, and the subway was closed down within the year. The project was shut down when a stock market crash caused investors to withdraw support. It is unclear that such a system could have been practical for a large-scale subway network.\\"Beach Pneumatic Transit - The Interborough Rapid Transit subway\\" (plrog.org) After the project was shut down, the tunnel entrance was sealed. The station, built in part of the basement of the Rogers Peet Building, was reclaimed for other uses until the entire building was lost to fire in 1898. In 1912, workers excavating for the BMT Broadway Line (serving the present-day ) dug into the old Beach tunnel, where they found the remains of the car, the tunnelling shield used during initial construction, and even the piano in the subway's waiting room. The shield was removed and donated to Cornell University, which has since lost track of its whereabouts. The tunnel was almost completely within the limits of the Broadway Line's City Hall station, but it is rumored that a small portion could still be accessed by a manhole on Reade Street. The New-York Historical Society commissioned a plaque honoring Alfred Beach to be placed in the City Hall station. Although the Beach Pneumatic Transit lasted for only three years, the project gave rise to the New York pneumatic tube mail system, which was based on the request that Beach had made to Tweed and which ran until 1953. Design =Aesthetics= The station was very ornate, and was adorned with frescoes and s. It was illuminated by zirconia lamps that revealed the luxurious interior.\\"The Pneumatic Mail Tubes\\" (USPS) There were statues and a goldfish pond in the station that people could look at while they waited for their turn to enter the ride. =Technical specifications= The car could hold 22 people, and the riders would enter the site at Devlin's Clothing Store, a well-known shop located at 260 Broadway, on the southwest corner of Warren Street.\\"They found the tube in excellent condition\\" (Columbia University) The ride was controlled by a Roots blower, nicknamed \\"the Western Tornado\\", built by Roots Patent Force Rotary Blowers (see Roots Blower Company). When the car reached the end, baffles on the blower system were reversed, and the car was pulled back by the suction. For the tunnels, Beach used a circular design based upon Brunel's rectangular shield, which may represent the shift in design from rectangular to cylindrical. It was unclear when or who transitioned the tunneling shield design from rectangular to circular until The New York Times wrote an article describing the original Beach tunneling shield in 1870. * See also: Related developments The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway was a similar but longer system which operated in 1864 on the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London. In 2013, entrepreneur Elon Musk proposed a hyperloop system, which he hoped would one day propel capsules through evacuated tubes at high speeds using magnetic levitation and linear electric motors. This system has not been fully realized.  In Pop Culture  The Beach Underground Railway is featured in the direct-to-video sequel American Tail 3: The Treasure of Manhattan Island. Sub-Rosa Subway is a song by Klaatu which describes the subway. In Ghostbusters II, a fictional pneumatic transit station and tunnel reminiscent of the Beach system is discovered by the Ghostbusters beneath First Avenue in Manhattan; the tunnel's completion date appears on-screen as 1870, the same year that the Warren-to-Murray tunnel was completed.

In 2013, after approximately 10 years of measurements, LOPES was finally switched off and dismantled. There are different ways to observe cosmic rays, or, more accurately, the air showers that cosmic rays produce when they enter our atmosphere. Traditionally, one directly measures the shower products that make it all the way to the surface. These may be detected by using for example particle counters. In the case of KASCADE, the muons in the shower produce a short flash of Cherenkov light when they traverse a slab of scintillator material. These flashes can be registered using photomultipliers. The LOPES project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a different technique, in which not the shower products themselves are observed, but secondary radio radiation that is generated by the shower. Charged particles in the shower, mostly electrons and positrons, are deflected slightly in Earth's magnetic field. As these particles change direction, they emit synchrotron radiation. This radiation is visible as a bright flash on the sky for several nanoseconds at frequencies up to a few hundred MHz. It is hoped that the LOPES project will pave the way for more cosmic ray experiments with digital radio telescopes, such as LOFAR. In the first phase until 2003, LOPES consisted of ten dipole antennas. This has been expanded to a total number of 30 antennas as of summer 2005. These antennas are read out digitally and are connected to a central computer. Here, the data from the antennas is correlated by software, so that the antennas together essentially form a phased array. The software can point the array by forming a virtual beam and is also able to adaptively suppress interference from other sources, such as radio and TV stations. The test array was first set up at the MPIfR in Bonn to check the hardware and develop the software. Afterwards it has been installed at the KASCADE experiment in Karlsruhe. This is a running and well calibrated air shower experiment, which provides LOPES with a suitable trigger and reconstructed shower parameters. These parameters will act as a starting point for LOPES and have been used to calibrate its results. In a second phase starting 2006, 15 antennas have been rotated by 90¬∞ to measure the polarization of the radio signal emitted by air showers. This efforts have been intensified in the third and last phase of LOPES starting 2010, when 10 new antenna stations were installed which allow to measure the complete polarization at each station. After leading to many scientific results published in various journals, LOPES has finally been switched off in 2013. LOPES is a collaboration of ASTRON (Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy, Dwingeloo, The Netherlands), the Max- Planck-Institut f√ºr Radioastronomie (Bonn, Germany), Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands), the Institute of Data Processing and Electronics (IPE) and the Institut f√ºr Kernphysik (IKP), both at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Karlsruhe, Germany), and the KASCADE-Grande collaboration. The KASCADE-Grande collaboration consists of groups from Germany, Poland, Romania, and Italy.

With its passage, Westminster relinquished nearly all of its authority to legislate for the Dominions, effectively making them de jure sovereign nations. With the passage of the Adoption Act, the British Parliament could no longer legislate for the Commonwealth without the express request and consent of the Australian Parliament. The act received Royal Assent on 9 October 1942, but the adoption of the Statute was made retroactive to 3 September 1939, when Australia entered World War II. The Act is more important for its symbolic value than for the legal effect of its provisions. While Australia's growing independence from the United Kingdom was well accepted, the adoption of the Statute of Westminster formally demonstrated Australia's independence to the world. Background Australia's progression to effective independence was gradual and largely without incident. New South Wales was founded as a British colony in Sydney in 1788. Other colonies split away from New South Wales or were separately established over the Australian continent in the ensuing decades. The colonies became self-governing during the second half of the 19th century, starting with Victoria in 1852, although well before this time, all of the colonies had non-elected Legislative Councils to advise their respective Governors on matters of administration. When the Commonwealth of Australia was formed with federation of the six colonies in 1901, following royal assent of the Commonwealth of Australia Act 1900, it became classified as a Dominion of the British Empire. This accorded Australia somewhat greater independence, though it was legally a self- governing British colony. After the end of World War I, each of the Dominions (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa but not Newfoundland) independently signed the Treaty of Versailles, but under the collective umbrella of the British Empire. Each Dominion also became a founding member of the League of Nations in its own right. This was an important international demonstration of the independence of the Dominions. The Statute of Westminster During the 1926 Imperial Conference, the governments of the Dominions and of the United Kingdom endorsed the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which declared that the Dominions were autonomous members of the British Empire, equal to each other and to the United Kingdom. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave legal effect to the Balfour Declaration and other decisions made at the Imperial Conferences. Most importantly, it declared that the Parliament of the United Kingdom no longer had any legislative authority over the Dominions. Previously, the Dominions were legally self-governing colonies of the United Kingdom, and thus had no legal international status. The Statute made the Dominions de jure independent nations. The Statute took effect immediately over Canada, South Africa and the Irish Free State. However, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland had to ratify the Statute through legislation before it would apply to them. Canada also requested certain exemptions from the Statute in regard to the Canadian Constitution. Australian politicians initially resisted ratification of the Statute. John Latham, the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs under Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, was particularly opposed to ratifying the Statute, because he thought it would weaken military and political ties with the United Kingdom. Latham had attended both the 1926 Imperial Conference and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, and he had much experience in international affairs. He preferred that the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Dominions not be codified in legislation. However, other politicians supported the Statute, and the new independence it gave to Australia. In 1930, shortly before the Statute was enacted, the Labor Prime Minister James Scullin recommended Sir Isaac Isaacs (then the Chief Justice of Australia) as the Governor-General of Australia, to replace Lord Stonehaven. This was a departure from previous practice whereby the British monarch, acting on the advice of the British prime minister, would offer the Australian prime minister a number of choices for the position. However, the Australian prime minister, acting in line with the principles of the Balfour Declaration permitting Dominion governments to look after their own affairs, insisted on the appointment of Isaacs. Although King George V disapproved of Isaacs, the 1930 Imperial Conference upheld the procedure under the declaration, and so the King appointed Isaacs. The other Dominions supported this demonstration of political independence. Adoption =1937 bill= For a decade after its creation, adoption of the Statute was not seen as a priority for Australian governments. In June 1937, the Lyons Government introduced the Statute of Westminster Adoption Bill into the parliament, where it passed its second reading in the House of Representatives. However, the bill lapsed when parliament was dissolved prior to the 1937 federal election. The government promised to reintroduce the bill in the 1937 speech from the throne, but no further action was taken. The issue was occasionally raised in parliament, but adoption was seen as non-urgent. In introducing the 1937 bill, Attorney- General Robert Menzies said that adopting the Statute had only \\"relatively minor advantages\\" and would alter Australia's existing constitution existing constitutional arrangements \\"to a very trifling extent\\". He observed that \\"the real and administrative legislative independence of Australia has never been challenged since the Commonwealth was created\\", and said the primary reason for adopting the Statute was to bring Australia \\"into line uniformly with the other dominions\\" who had already adopted it. =1942 bill= John Curtin, who became prime minister eight weeks before the Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor, was finally prompted to adopt the Statute in 1942 after the Fall of Singapore and the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse. Prior conservative governments had asserted that British military forces would be able to protect Australia, but Curtin, along with External Affairs Minister Dr H. V. Evatt, thought that focusing on an alliance with the United States would be more valuable. Before the 1940s, the United Kingdom had managed Australia's foreign relations as a matter of course. Curtin's decision to formally adopt the Statute of Westminster in late 1942 was a demonstration to the international community that Australia was an independent nation. The immediate prompt for the adoption of the Statute of Westminster was the death sentence imposed on two homosexual Australian sailors for the murder of their crewmate committed on HMAS Australia in 1942. Since 7 November 1939, the Royal Australian Navy had operated subject to British imperial law, under which the two men were sentenced to death. It was argued that this would not have been their sentence if Australian law had applied, but the only way for the Australian government to get the sentences altered was by directly petitioning the King, who commuted them to life imprisonment. Adopting the Statute of Westminster, so that Australia became able to amend applicable imperial law, avoided a potential repetition of this situation. The men's sentences were later further reduced.R v Bevan [1942] HCA 12; (1942) CLR 452. Provisions of the Act The act had just three sections, one setting out the short title, one declaring that the Act was to come into operation as soon as it received Royal Assent, and one declaring that the Statute of Westminster had been adopted, and was considered to have had effect since 3 September 1939, the beginning of World War II. For a simple Act, it had a significant effect. Section 2 of the Statute of Westminster abrogated the effect of the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865, and adopting it meant that laws made by the Parliament of Australia which were repugnant to British laws were no longer invalid. Section 4 of the Statute provided that laws made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom would only have effect on a Dominion at the request of the government of that Dominion. Section 5 of the Statute removed British control over merchant shipping in Australian waters. Section 6 removed the British monarch's power to reserve certain legislation for his or her own consideration, rather than simply allowing the Governor-General to give the Royal Assent on the monarch's behalf.

Most of the novel is set in London, but many important events throughout the story occur in Sudan and Port Said. It follows the life of Dick Heldar, an artist and painter who goes blind, and his unrequited love for his childhood playmate, Maisie. It is Kipling's first novel, written when he was 26 years old, and is semi-autobiographical; being based upon his own unrequited love for Florence Garrard. Though it was poorly received by critics, the novel has managed to remain in print for over a century. It was also adapted into a play, two silent films as well as a drama film.  Background  By the time Kipling returned to England in 1889, he was well on this way to literary fame due to his successful short stories. However, as a novel was expected from him, he began to write The Light That Failed on a very short deadline of three months. The novel's inspiration was his failed relationship with Florence Garrard, whom he had first met when he was being fostered with his sister in Southsea. Kipling remained in touch with Garrard after returning to India to work as a reporter, corresponding with her over letters. She later terminated their relationship after two years, leaving Kipling devastated as he had believed himself engaged to her. He met her again in 1890 in London and attempted to reignite their relationship. He also visited her in Paris where she was studying in the Acad√©mie Julian. It is not known what happened between them except that he was never to see Garrard again. While most of the novel is set in London, the military campaigns are set in Sudan and Egypt, especially in Port Said and Suakin. The Mahdist War serves as a background to Dick's first encounter with Torpenhow, and his later death during the reconquest.  Plot summary  The story begins with Dick and Maisie as orphan children in a seaside boarding house under the care of Mrs. Jennet (a sadist drawn from Kipling's own childhood experience with a Mrs Holloway). Dick confesses his infatuation with Maisie but she informs him that she will soon be leaving to complete her education. Years later, Dick is working as a painter and artist among the British armed forces in Sudan. He meets a war correspondent named Torpenhow who, witnessing his skill, arranges for Dick to be hired by the syndicate that he works for. The two men quickly strike a friendship and help each other in their respective trades. Dick is later injured by a sword-cut to the head and spends a night in delirium, moaning about Maisie. Once the campaign is over, Dick returns to London where he eventually reunites with Torpenhow. His war sketches have drawn attention in England and when his former employers try to withhold his submitted works, Dick bullies their representative into returning them. He shares a rented apartment with Torpenhow in London where the two spend their time working and discussing \\"Art\\" along with a few other friends. Dick runs into Maisie again who is also working as a painter and a student under Dick's former teacher, Kami. He asks her about their relationship and though she rebuffs his advances, she asks him to visit her every Sunday as she values his advice about her work. He relents, assuming that she would grow to love him as he loves her. He also meets Maisie's roommate, a red-haired girl who immediately despises him. While discussing her work, Dick enters into an argument with Maisie about her attempt to paint the \\"Melancolia\\" from the book, The City of Dreadful Night. Dick says that it is beyond her ability and challenges her that he can do it better. Maisie soon departs for Paris to work under Kami for some months and Dick sees her off at the harbour. He finally convinces her to give him a kiss, making the red-haired girl furious. When he returns to his room, he discovers that Torpenhow has brought in a pretty young prostitute named Bessie whom he found collapsed in the hall. Taken by her face, Dick convinces the girl to return to his studio so that he can paint her in return for payment. Eventually, Bessie tries to seduce Torpenhow though they are interrupted by Dick, who rebukes Torpenhow and sends him away. Bessie is furious at Dick but continues to model for him because of the money. Dick hits upon his notion for the \\"Melancolia\\" who he models on Bessie but discovers to his horror that he is going blind due to a past battle injury. He still manages to complete the painting a week after Torpenhow returns, relying on whiskey to help his failing vision. However, Bessie destroys the painting in revenge for his earlier interference. Torpenhow hides the fact from Dick, who is now completely blind, regretting that he ever helped the girl. When news arrives of a new campaign in Sudan, Torpenhow visits Maisie in Paris and persuades her to meet Dick in the hope that she will look after him. Though visibly anguished, she refuses and Dick gently asks her to leave. He hides this fact from Torpenhow, who leaves for the campaign with their friends. Dick meets with Bessie again and upon learning of the Melancolia's destruction, decides to leave for the campaign as well. With help from an acquaintance in Port Said, he reaches the battlefield at the very start of a battle but is killed by a bullet to the head.  Themes  A major theme that runs throughout the novel is unrequited love, embodied in Dick's love for Maisie and his ultimately futile attempts at getting her to fall in love with him in return. In contrast, the novel also explores the friendship between Dick and Torpenhow with The Guardian noting it to be \\"the only emotionally satisfying relationship\\" in the novel. Kipling also depicts the cruelty and brutality in war as well as daily life, in events such as Torpenhow gouging out an Arab soldier's eye, Dick's bullying of the syndicate representative, his treatment of Bessie and his response to the gunning down of enemy soldiers in the final chapter. He focuses also on art and the role of the artist, and Dick's paintings form a central feature, especially the Melancolia which is ultimately destroyed. Kipling especially derides the commercialisation of art when Dick is chastised by his friends for his arrogance at his successes and love for money. He contrasts it with Dick's sarcasm for having to clean a graphic portrait of a Sudanese rifleman to appeal to the general public. The novel also explores masculinity and contrasts it with feminine traits and roles as it was during the Victorian period. This is evident in Dick's experiences as a war artist which is shown to have given him a wider perspective on his art and is something that Maisie will never experience. Kipling also shows the effect of childhood abuse with Mrs. Jennett's treatment of Dick causing him to become a \\"natural liar\\" and \\"unkempt in body and savage in soul.\\" This is reflected in his later bullying of the syndicate's representative. The novel also deals with blindness and Dick's slide into despair and helplessness due to the loss of his ability to work and the resulting abandonment by Maisie. Dick sums it up with the statement that \\"...it is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone, so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work. When that resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone\\".  Publication history  The Light That Failed was initially set to be first published by John W. Lovell in New York but it was delayed, allowing for Lippincott's Magazine to publish it first in January 1891. The novel, Kipling's first ever, was published in four different versions over a period of two years. The Lippincott edition had twelve chapters and a happy ending. However, Kipling had originally written a fifteen chapter version that ended with Dick's death. Deciding that this would be too sad for public consumption, he changed it to end with the protagonists' engagement. Lippincott paid Kipling $800 for the novel. The fifteen chapter edition would later be published as a hardback \\"Standard edition\\" by MacMillan with a prefatory note that stated: \\"... The Light That Failed as it was originally conceived by the Writer.\\" It is believed that Kipling's mother had pressed release the happy ending which Kipling later regretted, leading to the note in the \\"Standard edition\\" of the novel.  Critical reception  The Light That Failed was poorly received by critics in the main. Jad Adams calls the novel richly revealing even though it was badly reviewed, especially its man-loving and misogynistic undercurrents. He calls it \\"... a metaphor for the failing gallantry of 19th-century man confronting the new woman.\\" Andrew Lycett, in his biography of Kipling, called it a \\"grown-up novel by an emotionally immature man.\\" It has been variously derided as \\"sentimental, unstructured, melodramatic, chauvinistic, and implausible.\\" Kipling himself admitted in his autobiography that the novel was a conte (short tale of adventure) and not a built book. Lord Birkenhead calls the novel a \\"rotten apple\\" among Kipling's other published works. George Orwell, in an unsigned review of \\"Rudyard Kipling\\" by Edward Shankspublished in The Listener on 25th April 1940, says, \\"Curiously enough, he (Shanks) has a very low opinion of that excellent novel The Light That Failed.\\" Orwell's review is item 614 in Volume 12 of Peter Davison's Collected Works of George Orwell.  Adaptations  A play by George Fleming, starring Johnston Forbes-Robertson, his wife Gertrude Elliott, and Sydney Valentine, was first staged in the West End from February to April 1903 and moved on to Broadway in November, making the story more famous.The Light that Failed as originally produced on Broadway at the Knickerbocker Theatre, Nov. 9 1903 to Dec. 1903, 32 performances; IBDb.com It was made into a 1916 silent film by Path√©, with Robert Edeson and Jose Collins, a 1923 silent film by Famous Players-Lasky, and a 1939 film by Paramount, starring Ronald Colman as Heldar, with Muriel Angelus, Ida Lupino, and Walter Huston. It was also adapted for television in the US in 1961 by the Breck Shampoo Company, with Richard Basehart starring as Heldar and Susan Harrison as Maisie.

Tittenhurst Park is a Grade II listed early Georgian country house in an estate of off London Road at Beggar's Bush near Ascot and over the parish border into Sunningdale, both in the English county of Berkshire. It was famously the home of musicians John Lennon and Yoko Ono from the late summer of 1969 until August 1971, and then the home of Ringo Starr and family from 1973 until the late 1980s. Starr sold the property to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, in 1989. Early history The present house dates back to 1737, although the facade is largely circa 1830. In 1869, the property was owned by Thomas Holloway, philanthropist and founder of two large institutions which he built nearby: Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey, and Royal Holloway College, now known as Royal Holloway, University of London in Englefield Green. About 1898, the house was purchased by Thomas Hermann Lowinsky, the former general manager of the Hyderabad (Deccan) Co coal mines in India. He was an active member of the Royal Horticultural Society and won their gold medal for his rhododendrons, an outstanding collection of which he built up at Tittenhurst, including one he named 'Mrs Tom Lowinsky'. Amongst Lowinsky's children who grew up at the park was his daughter, Xenia Noelle Field, the prison reformer and horticulturist, and surrealist artist Thomas Esmond Lowinsky.  John Lennon  Lennon purchased the property after the sale of Kenwood in Weybridge, Surrey, his earlier home with first wife Cynthia Lennon, because of its resemblance to Calderstones House in Liverpool, where he had spent time as a child. Lennon bought the house for ¬£145,000 from Peter Cadbury. The estate included gardens, a Tudor cottage and servants' cottages. He and Ono spent twice the purchase price on renovations, transforming the interior of the house to their liking, commissioning a set of hand-woven Asian rugs, and installing a man-made lake without planning permission which they could see from their bedroom window. The last Beatles photo session took place at Tittenhurst Park on 22 August 1969, and the photos were used for the front and back covers of their Hey Jude album (a collection of single sides) early in 1970. Also during that year, and in the wake of the Beatles' breakup, Lennon built his own recording studio, dubbed Ascot Sound Studios, in the estate grounds, where he and Ono recorded their next several albums. The matching cover photos of their twin Plastic Ono Band albums were taken at Tittenhurst by the pair, using an Instamatic camera, and portions of the Imagine film-length video, which included selections from the Fly album, were also filmed in the grounds. The interior was also used as the backdrop for the film that was used to promote the single \\"Imagine\\", with Yoko seen opening the window shutters as John played a white grand piano. During 1970 and 1971, Lennon and Ono began to visit the United States, first for Primal Therapy at Arthur Janov's Primal Institute in California, then for child custody hearings over Ono's daughter Kyoko Chan Cox, in Houston and New York City. Ono had spent her late teens and twenties living in New York (including Scarsdale and Greenwich Village), and preferred there to England ‚Äî as did Lennon. They rented a Bank Street apartment late in 1970 and, on 31 August 1971, the Lennons moved to New York City permanently. John would never return to England. Tittenhurst was Grade II listed for its architectural merit in March 1972. In 2004, Peter Dennison, owner of French furniture firm Moth, offered for sale one of the original lavatory seats from Tittenhurst Park. It was displayed in the window of the Brighton Musical Exchange shop in Trafalgar Street, Brighton. Dennison had bought the seat when his architectural salvage firm was offered furniture by the contractors doing the renovations at Tittenhurst Park. The asking price was ¬£285. In 2010, the lavatory itself was offered for sale at auction in aid of the Paul McCartney Auditorium at the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts. Lennon told builder John Hancock to keep the ceramic lavatory and \\"use it as a plant pot\\" after he had installed a new one. It was stored in a shed at Hancock's home for 40 years until he died. The lot had an estimate of ¬£750‚Äì1,000. Also offered for sale was a mono copy of Two Virgins, recorded at Kenwood (estimate ¬£2,500) and Julian Lennon's harmonica, given to Mr Hancock by the musician who asked him to take it home as \\"Julian was driving him mad with it\\". Lennon told Mr Hancock he would tell Julian it was lost (estimate ¬£750‚Äì1,000). In December 2015, several additional items from Tittenhurst Park were put up for sale as part of the Ringo Starr & Barbara Bach Auction held by Julien's Auctions. These items were originally owned by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and were included in the sale of Tittenhurst Park to Ringo Starr in 1973. Items included several carved bust statues depicted on the Hey Jude album cover, a wood refectory table and benches, a stone garden bench, several stained glass panels and a mirror panel with floral and foliate silver overlay.  Ascot Sound Studios  Ascot Sound Studios was a recording studio built by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1970, on the grounds of Tittenhurst Park. Lennon built the studio, which featured eight recording tracks on one-inch open-reel tape and a sixteen-channel mixing console, so that he and wife/collaborator Ono could record without the inconvenience of having to book studio time at Abbey Road or another location. First to be recorded were the twin Plastic Ono Band albums (portions of which were also recorded at Abbey Road), released simultaneously in December 1970. (Lennon's rose to #6 in the Billboard charts, while Ono's‚Äîlargely recorded in a single night of jamming with Lennon, Klaus Voormann on bass and Ringo Starr on drums‚Äîbarely made the Top 200.) The following year brought Lennon's best-selling Imagine, with Phil Spector as co- producer. George Harrison joined Lennon and Voormann at Ascot to play on several songs, including \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", a song that criticised the ex- Beatle, Paul McCartney. Ringo Starr visited the studio during the recording of the song and was reportedly upset, saying: \\"That's enough, John.\\" The album sessions were extensively filmed, and the footage appears in both the Imagine: John Lennon documentary and a separate documentary about the making of the album. Recorded at the same time as Imagine was Yoko Ono's album Fly (whose title song was the soundtrack to their movie of the same name), and these appear to be the last recordings the couple completed at the studio. Ringo Starr; Startling Studios  Deciding to stay long-term in the United States, Lennon sold Tittenhurst Park to his former bandmate Ringo Starr, who purchased the property on 18 September 1973. Starr renamed the studio \\"Startling Studios\\" and made the facility available for use by other recording artists. Portions of T. Rex's film Born to Boogie were shot there, and the house also saw a social visit from cult folk musician Nick Drake. Judas Priest planned to record their British Steel album at Startling Studios, but found the house itself more suitable, and moved recording equipment there. Judas Priest's live album Unleashed in the East was also mixed and completed there. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan In 1988, Starr sold the property for ¬£5 million to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, former President of the United Arab Emirates and former ruler of Abu Dhabi. Zayed also owned Park Gate House in Ham, south west London, and would buy another property in Berkshire, Ascot Place, the year after his purchase of Tittenhurst. During Zayed's subsequent renovations of Tittenhurst in 1989 and 1990, master recordings and films from Startling Studios and paintings by Lennon on the walls of the house were destroyed, and a wall was constructed around the perimeter of the property. Since then further extensive renovations to the manor have been carried out, and the interior no longer resembles the house lived in by Lennon and Starr. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan died on 2 November 2004.  Gypsy caravan  In 2013, a gypsy caravan once owned by John Lennon and Ringo Starr was found at Ringo Starr's former Surrey home after being 'lost' for over 40 years. A charitable trust has taken ownership and says they would like to see it handed over to a cultural museum in Liverpool. The trust came into possession of the caravan after the owner of Starr's former home in Longcross sold up.BBC News: Beatles Sgt Pepper's gypsy caravan unearthed in Ascot, 26 May 2013, accessed 26 May 2013 Notes References Further reading * Scott Cardinal, Tittenhurst Park: History, Gardens, & Architecture, vol. 1, Campfire Network, 2017 * Scott Cardinal, Tittenhurst Park: John Lennon & Yoko Ono, vol. 2, Campfire Network, 2017 * Scott Cardinal, Tittenhurst Park: Ringo Starr & the Sheikh, vol. 3, Campfire Network, 2017  External links  * Ascot Sound Studios & Ascot Sound Label ‚Äì official website * Photoblog for John Lennon at Tittenhurst Park * Photoblog for Tittenhurst Park Architecture, Gardens, History, Books * Beatles final photo session ‚Äì held at Tittenhurst Park in 1969 * IMDb ‚Äì filming at Tittenhurst Park * Terra Firma Landscape Architects Category:Buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Category:Country houses in Berkshire Category:Georgian architecture in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Berkshire Category:Grade II listed houses Category:Houses completed in the 18th century Category:John Lennon Category:Yoko Ono Category:Ringo Starr ","title":"Tittenhurst Park"},{"id":"2376344","text":"Otto Donner, date unknown Otto Donner (15 December 1835, Kokkola - 17 September 1909, Helsinki) was a Finnish linguist and politician.

Initially not published in the US, it was later issued as a paperback by Dell Publishing in September 1963. It was the last of six novels Christie wrote under the nom-de-plume Mary Westmacott. Explanation of the novel's title The title of the novel is taken from Chapter 11, Verse 30 of the Gospel of Matthew. The full line, as quoted in the Epigraph to the novel, is: :\\"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\\" Plot summary When Laura Franklin's younger sister Shirley comes into the world, Laura instantly resents her, and soon begins to wish and even to pray that her baby sister will die. But after saving Shirley's life in a fire, she experiences a complete change of feeling, and becomes very affectionate and protective towards her. Later, as the sisters grow up and fall in love, Laura begins to realise that the burden of her love for Shirley has had a dramatic effect on both their lives. Literary significance and reception Siriol Hart's review in the Times Literary Supplement of 7 December 1956, said, \\"The Burden is by a writer who has been Mary Westmacott for six books and Agatha Christie for more than anyone can count. In spite of the modern smart trimmings, this seems very much the art of story-telling that would be at home in the most staunchly traditional woman's magazine, where all the problems are resolved when the mousey heroine puts on some lipstick (called, in this case \\"Fatal Apple\\"), and finds the love of her life.\\"The Times Literary Supplement 7 December 1956 (Page 717) Vernon Johnson reviewed the novel in the 20 November 1956, issue of The Guardian when he called it a \\"fantastical novelette\\" and quoted several lines from the book in a disparaging fashion, stating that they were examples of \\"the style and the treatment\\".The Guardian 20 November 1956 (Page 4)  Publication history  * 1956, Heinemann (London), 12 November 1956, Hardcover, 236 pp * 1963, Dell Books (New York), September 1963, Paperback, 223 pp * 1973, William Collins and Sons, Hardcover, 192 pp * 1973.

The 2016 US Census estimated the number of people with Egyptian ancestry at 256,000. Egyptian Americans may also include the Egyptian foreign-born population in the United States. The US Census Bureau estimated in 2016 that there were 181,677 foreign-born Egyptians in the United States. They represented around 0.4% of the total US foreign-born population as 42,194,354 first-generation immigrants in 2016.  History  Egyptians began to migrate to the U.S. in significant numbers in the second half of the twentieth century. The majority of Egyptians left their country for economic or educational reasons. However, many emigrated because they were concerned about the political developments that were occurring in Egypt after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Thousands of Egyptians, mainly Copts, left Egypt in 1967 after its defeat in the Six-Day War of 1967. From 1967 to 1977, more than 15,000 Egyptians immigrated to the United States alone. Since the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat and consequential inauguration of Hosni Mubarak as the President, the Egyptian economy has endured three decades of economic stagnation that has prompted a significant number of Egyptians to emigrate to more prosperous countries, such as the United States. Attracted by the higher standards of living and greater civil liberties, Egyptian expatriates have traditionally favoured permanent residence in countries such as the United States, and Canada, but sizeable numbers are also present in Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The first wave of Egyptian immigrants to the United States were mostly educated professionals and skilled workers. Egyptian immigration to the United States was further eased by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allowed selective entry of certain professionals, especially scientists, from countries such as Egypt, which was up until then subjected to stringent emigration restrictions. As a result, most Egyptian Americans, especially first and second generation Egyptians, have in comparison, become generally very well educated relative to the American population as a whole.  Demographics  The New York City Metropolitan Area, including Northern New Jersey and New York City, is home to by far the largest Egyptian population in the United States. As of 2012, there were 143,085 Egyptian-born residents in the United States. In 2016, there were 181,677 foreign-born Egyptians in the United States according to the US Census Bureau's 2016 estimates. The Arab American Institute indicates that Egyptians are among the larger Arab American populations in the country. Considering the foreign-born population in 2016, Egyptian immigrants represented the second largest group of the Arab foreign-born population in the United States. They followed the Iraqis who accounted for 221,587 foreign-born individuals. After the Iraqi and Egyptian foreign-born populations, the Lebanese foreign-born population in the United States represented 128,608 first-generation immigrants in 2016. Although the Lebanese foreign-born population was the leading Arab immigrant population in the US from 1960 till the 1990s, the Egyptian foreign-born population took the lead at the start of the millennium increasing in more than ten times its size of 1960. According to US Census Bureau data, around 123,489 people self-reported Egyptian ancestry alone and a further 19,343 people self-reported Egyptian ancestry in combination with another ancestry. Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau also announced in 2014 that it would offer a new MENA ethnic option for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world. Most Egyptians in the United States live in the New York City‚ÄìNorthern New Jersey‚ÄìLong Island area (39,020). The next largest concentrations of Egyptians are in Los Angeles‚ÄìLong Beach‚ÄìSanta Ana (19,170), Washington, D.C.‚ÄìArlington‚ÄìAlexandria (5,770), Nashville‚ÄìDavidson‚ÄìMurfreesboro‚ÄìFranklin (3,865), Chicago‚ÄìJoliet‚ÄìNaperville (3,705), Riverside‚ÄìSan Bernardino‚ÄìOntario (3,630), Miami‚ÄìFort Lauderdale‚ÄìPompano Beach (3,625), Philadelphia‚ÄìCamden‚ÄìWilmington (3,280), Houston‚ÄìSugar Land‚ÄìBaytown (2,820), San Francisco‚ÄìOakland‚ÄìFremont (2,745), and other areas (55,455).  Predominant means of entry  In the total foreign-born Egyptian population of 2016, 67% were naturalized US citizens. A majority of 32% of foreign-born Egyptians in 2016 gained legal permanent resident (LPR) status as immediate relatives of US citizens, the primary means of entry for most US foreign-born populations. Therefore, social networks through familial ties remain the primary means of entry for Egyptians obtaining LPR status, nonetheless, almost as many, precisely 29%, enter through Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990. Diversity immigrants come from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US and applicants are required to have an educational or professional background. In 2016, the third major channel of obtaining LPR status in the US for Egyptian first-generation immigrants were as refugees and asylees. The share of the Egyptian foreign- born population obtaining LPR status as refugees or asylees was at 23% in 2016. These figures were particularly high following the 2011 uprisings and post-revolutionary period in Egypt. Specifically, 2,571 foreign-born Egyptians were affirmatively granted asylum status in 2012 compared to 751 in 2011. Nevertheless, these numbers decreased to 690 affirmative asylum status in 2016.  Religions  In contrast to the population of Egypt, where Muslims constitute approximately 90% of the population, the majority of Egyptian Americans are Coptic Christians, with Muslims forming a minority in the community. The Copts began to immigrate to the United States as early as the late 1940s. There are hundreds of Coptic Orthodox churches in the United States (along with over 90 congregations in Canada). It is estimated that there are over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America as a whole. A small number of Egyptian Christians who immigrated to the U.S. include Coptic Catholics and Protestants. In addition to Coptic Christians, there are also small groups of non-native Christians from Egypt, such as Armenians, Greeks, and Syro-Lebanese, who belong to Armenian, Eastern Orthodox, or Melkite Catholic churches. There is even a small Jewish community that exists.  Socioeconomic status  The first immigrants of Egypt that arrived in United States were mainly university graduates, and some Egyptians who had come seeking further education. Among these immigrants were doctors, accountants, engineers, lawyers and even teachers from major universities. The second wave had university degrees, but had to accept menial jobs (many of them drove taxicabs, or waited on tables in restaurants). Some citizens even became entrepreneurs. The Egyptian foreign-born population in the US is characterized by a relatively high educational status and professional attainment in comparison to the total US population. In 2016, Egyptian first- generation immigrants were more than twice as likely to have a bachelor's degree in comparison to the total US population and 20% received a graduate or professional degree versus 12.3% of the US population. This high level of educational attainment may be part of a wider phenomenon of skilled Egyptian migration to the US. In other words, the high rates of unemployment for educated young people in Egypt versus the educational and professional opportunities in the US make immigration an appealing alternative. This is especially true in periods of political uncertainty like the 1970s or following the 2011 uprisings in Egypt. Furthermore, since many Egyptian immigrants enter the US through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program which requires a certain educational level, it is understandable that immigration policies have also pushed the more educated Egyptians to migrate to the US. Concerning occupational differences, the Egyptian foreign-born population and the American populace do not showcase startling divergences. Yet in 2016 estimates by the US Census Bureau, both groups tended to contrast at the more extreme ends of the professional market. Indeed, Egyptian first-generation immigrants in 2016 outnumbered the US population in the management, business, science and arts occupations. Nearly 50% of the Egyptian foreign-born population was employed in these occupations whereas 37% of the US population was represented in these sectors. On the other hand, the share of Egyptian immigrants in the natural resources, construction and maintenance occupations represented under 4% of the Egyptian foreign-born population while almost 9% of the American population appeared in this sector.  Relations with Egypt  Recently the Egyptian government has ramped up efforts to increase ties with its expatriate community, as it seeks to capitalize on the possibility of increased foreign direct investment, and multilateral business by wealthy Egyptians abroad. The Egyptian government has actively been encouraging investment in its economy, and views the Egyptians diaspora as an important source of income through remittances sent home to family members. Over the past few years, the Egyptian American Businessmen's Association has maintained a continual presence in Egypt, with representative delegates visiting Egypt on a regular basis and meeting with officials as well as conversing with local MPs on various economic matters. The Union of Egyptians is an organization created with the primary aim of meeting Egyptian needs abroad by securing economic links with the homeland. Several organizations also prefer focusing on educational and cultural ties between Egyptian Americans and their home country. In 2001 Universal Union of Egyptian Expatriates was created in order to help Egyptian Expatriates. Today, more than 6 million Egyptians live, work and study abroad are connected. A fair percentage of Egyptian Expatriates settled in the USA. Almost 70‚Äì75% of Egyptian Expatriates holding the membership of the UUEE are Muslims and 25‚Äì30% are Coptic. On February 11, 2012, a coalition of American Egyptians from around the United States launched a new advocacy organization, the American Egyptian Strategic Alliance.

Since about 1980, these outbursts have become quite regular, typically lasting about two months and occurring about every three years. Thus, GK Persei seems to have changed from a classical nova like Nova Aquilae 1918 to something resembling a typical dwarf nova-type cataclysmic variable star.

It is a binary system, comprising a white dwarf and donor low-mass star in close orbit to the point of being only semidetached. The white dwarf sucks matter off its companion, which has filled its Roche lobe, onto its accretion disk and surface until the excess material is blown off in a thermonuclear event. This material then forms an expanding shell, which eventually thins out and disappears. First seen by Zygmunt Laskowski, a medical professor and amateur astronomer,The Contribution of Amateurs to Astronomy, Proceedings of Colloquium 98 of the International Astronomical Union, June 20‚Äì24, 1987, page 41 and then confirmed on the night of 8 June 1918 by the UK amateur astronomer Grace Cook, The nova is estimated at between 784 to 839 light years distance from Earth . Nova Aquilae reached a peak magnitude of ‚àí0.5; it was the brightest nova recorded in the era of the telescope. It was brighter than all stars but Sirius and Canopus. Tycho's and Kepler's supernovae were brighter, but both occurred before the invention of the telescope. Originally a star system with a magnitude of 11.43, it took twelve days to fade three magnitudes and then 18.6 years to fade to quiescence. In 1964 Robert P. Kraft ascertained that it was a binary system, recently determined to be true for several other novae at the time. The star system has settled to an average apparent magnitude of 11.4 since the 1940s, fading by around 1/100 of a magnitude per decade. Spectroscopic analysis conducted by Arenas and colleagues indicated the system consisted of a white dwarf of about 1.2 times as massive as the sun, with an accretion disk, and a companion star with about 20% of the Sun's mass. This second star is most likely a red dwarf. The two stars orbit each other approximately every 3 hours 20 minutes.

The Encantadia franchise, consisting of four series Encantadia (2005), Etheria (2005‚Äì06), Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006), and Encantadia (2016), is primarily focused on Amihan's journey to the throne of the Kingdom of Lireo. Amihan is portrayed by actress Iza Calzado on the first 3 series, and in the spin-off movie Mulawin: The Movie, while Kylie Padilla portrayed the character in the 2016 series of the same name. In Encantadia, Amihan is the daughter of Mine-a, the Queen of Lireo and Raquim, prince of Sapiro. She was sent to the mortal world to save her from the Hathors who are planning to kill her, as she has been visionized as a threat to the Hathoria Kingdom. Her ancestry has never been kept secret from her as she was taught by her father about Encantadia during her childhood days. When the Hathors followed them in the mortal world, and succeeded in killing his father, she returned to Encantadia and reunited with her mother and 3 sisters. She succeeded her mother as the Queen of Lireo in Encantadia (2005) and continued her reign until Etheria (2006). She was then succeeded by her sister Danaya in Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006). Concept and creation Encantadia is a spin-off of Mulawin. In Mulawin, a similar character named Banayad (portrayed by Katarina Perez) was Encantadia's diwata of wind/air and could be considered as the first version of the character. In the Philippines, Amihan refers to the season dominated by the trade winds, which are experienced in the Philippines as a cool northeast wind. It is characterized by moderate temperatures, little or no rainfall, and a prevailing wind from the east. Encantadia writer, Suzette Doctolero based it on that concept as Amihan is the keeper of Gem of Wind/Air. In the series, four gems of nature referred as Brilyante (Gems) control balance in their world: the air, fire, water and earth. =Background= Amihan is the second oldest of the four daughters of Mine-a. She is named after Mine-a's sister in the hope that she would grow to be as kindhearted as her namesake. She is the child that would fulfill Cassiopeia's prophecy, a great ruler foretold to bring forth the ruin of the kingdom of Hathoria. Because of this, Hagorn, the King of Hathoria planned to assassinate the young child through Gurna, a Hathorian spy in the Lireo Kingdom. Due to the unsuccessful murder plot, Mine-a sent Amihan together with Raquim to the mortal world to save her daughter. She grew up in the world of the mortals, and doubting Encantadia as a mere fairy tale conjured up by her father Raquim until Hagorn attacked them one night and killed her father. She was brought back to Encantadia and reunited with her mother and sisters. Amihan is the mother-figure among the Sang'gres with a soft heart and just personality. She is regal and majestic, often exhibiting an aura of power and nobility, an ideal quality for a queen. Because of this, she was eyed as a threat to her eldest sister Pirena who dream of ruling their Kingdom. Appearances =Encantadia (2005)= Amihan is born on the day that Arvak was killed, fulfilling the first half of Cassiopeia's prophecy. When Mine-a was asleep, Gurna kidnapped Amihan and brought her to the forest to kill her but failed. Because of this incident and because of Cassiopeia's warning, Mine-a decided it was best for Raquim to bring Amihan to the human world for their child's safety. When his father was killed, she was brought back to Encantadia and reunited with her mother and sisters. When the time that Mine-a had to choose a successor, Amihan was put to test including her other sisters in which she had won. Amihan became the Queen of Lire-o to which her elder sister Pirena did not agree to. Pirena stole the gem of fire and defected from Lireo to make new allies in the Hathoria Kingdom. Amihan started her reign in the middle of a sprouting war between Lireo and Hathoria. Mine-a sought help from Emre and Emre's response to Mine-a is a child which Amihan will bear. After the death of their mother, Pirena surprises everyone by asking for repentance for all her sins. Unknown to her, Pirena is planning a coup-de-etat against her and eventually succeeded. Amihan was dethroned and took refuge in the forest of Lireo. She headed the War of the four Gems attempting to regain her throne, and eventually did. =Etheria (2005-06)= A prophecy by Ether was established a long time ago that if the last keen of the diwatas was born, the fallen Kingdom of Etheria will rise again. When Cassandra, granddaughter of Amihan was born, the prophecy became true and the fallen Kingdom poses a threat to now peaceful Encantadia. Amihan with her three sisters went back to the past to revert the prophecy by changing the history. Amihan headed their fight against the four Herans of Etheria in which they gain victory with the help of the \\"Inang brilyante\\". She was then succeeded by her youngest sister, Danaya as the Queen of Lireo. =Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006)= Because of the defeat of the Etherians, Ether flew around her kingdom which was all destroyed to find the Four herans. She found them all and kept their spirits in a crystal ball and brought them to the future. The Crystal ball broke and their spirits became free. They practiced fighting and planned to steal the four gems so Etheria may once again rise back in glory. Amihan fought against the Etherians once again to keep the gems in their territory. After the fight between them and the Etherians, Amihan was never seen again the Kingdom of Lireo and believed that they vanished with her other sisters. =Encantadia (2016)= The 2016 series is a reboot (often called as requel or retelling-sequel) to the 2005 fantasy series with the same name. It is the fourth series of the Encantadia franchise and is 11 years apart from the third one. It features the same character and story of Amihan with the 2005 series. It was portrayed by actress Kylie Padilla who underwent vigorous trainings in martial arts.

It had dropped by three magnitudes in an interval of 6.5 days, one of the sharpest declines ever noted for a nova. About 14 years later, the shell ejected by the nova event was detected, which allowed the distance to be computed. In 2000, this distance was revised to after correcting for probable errors. The Gaia spacecraft later measured the parallax of the star leading to an accurate distance of parsecs. The nova outburst can be explained by a white dwarf that is accreting matter from a companion; most likely a low-mass main sequence star. This close binary system has an orbital period of 1.47 hours, which is one of the shortest periods of the known classical nova. Unusually, the white dwarf may have a magnetic field. Other properties of the system remain uncertain, although observations of X-ray emission from the system suggest that the white dwarf has a mass of more than 1.1 times the mass of the Sun.

Von Sch√∂ning died on 28 August 1696 in Dresden and was buried in the chapel at Tamsel in DƒÖbroszyn. Hans Adam von Sch√∂ning was the owner of an estate in Brzoza. Family Hans Adams parents were Hans Adam (d 1664), squire of the Knights Hospitaller, and Marianne (born in Schapelow). He married Johanna Louise, of P√∂llnitz, in 1668. He had two sons, Boguslaus, Electorate of Saxony Lieutenant Colonel, and Johann (Hans) Ludwig of Tamsel, Electorate of Saxony Chamberlain, and Lieutenant Colonel. Military career He distinguished himself in many military campaigns, including the Turkish Wars, the Nine Years War against France, and the war against Sweden 1675-79 particularly during the conquest of Stettin, R√ºgen and Stralsund and in the expulsion of Sweden from Prussia. He famously quarreled with General von Barfus, and was eventually arrested for supposedly plotting to bring Saxony over to the French. In 1689 he took part in the successful Siege of Bonn. Schloss Tamsel Schloss Tamsel, between 1857 and 1883 Field-Marshal von Sch√∂ning later built a castle in Tamsel, Brandenburg (now Dabroszyn/DƒÖbroszynie, Poland).

All of the stories in the collection had previously been published in magazines (see First publication of stories below) and feature her detectives Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, first introduced in The Secret Adversary (1922). This collection of detective short stories has a theme connecting the stories, as well, \\"a group of short detective stories within a detective novel.\\" The collection was well received on publication, with the \\"merriest collection\\", with amiable parodies, to one reviewer who was less impressed, saying the stories were \\"entertaining enough\\". One noted that \\"By having two detectives who are usually alternately successful she [Christie] has always a foil, less obtuse than 'my dear Watson'. \\"Her literary skill is equal to the task\\" of parodies of the style of well-known detective writers. Some of the authors parodied in the 1920s are long-forgotten, yet a review in 1990 commented that \\"the parodies are not sharp enough for this to matter very much\\" to prevent enjoyment of the stories. It also noted that the plot of one story, \\"The House of Lurking Death\\", \\"anticipates\\" a detective novel published in 1930 by Dorothy Sayers. Plot introduction The Beresfords' old friend Mr Carter, from a government intelligence agency, arrives bearing a proposition for the adventurous duo. They are to take over 'the International Detective Agency', a recently cleaned-out spy stronghold, and pose as the owners so as to intercept any enemy messages coming through. In the meantime Tommy and Tuppence can take on cases as this detective agency, an opportunity that delights the young couple. They employ Albert, a young man also introduced in The Secret Adversary, as their assistant at the agency. The two tackle a series of cases ‚Äì mimicking in each the style of a famous fictional detective of the period, including Sherlock Holmes and Christie's own Hercule Poirot. At the end of the book, Tuppence reveals that she is pregnant, and will play a diminished role in the spy business.

Plot summaries =A Fairy in the Flat= Prudence (\\"Tuppence\\") Beresford, who is happily married to Tommy for six years, is bored with life. She flippantly discusses what exciting things she would wish to happen to her. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Mr Carter (see The Secret Adversary) who asks them to take over The International Detective Agency. The agency's manager, Theodore Blunt, is in prison. Carter's particular request is that they watch for letters on blue paper sent to Mr Blunt from a purported ham merchant anxious to trace his refugee wife. Each such letter will have a Russian stamp with a \\"16\\" written underneath. He asks for such letters to be sent to him immediately. =A Pot of Tea= Tommy's alias is Mr Blunt, while Tuppence is his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson. The porter from their flat, Albert is their office worker. After a week of refusing divorce cases, which Tuppence finds distasteful, they receive a visit from Lawrence St Vincent. He is the nephew of, and heir to, the Earl of Cheriton. He has fallen for a young woman called Janet who works in a hat shop in Brooks Street. She has disappeared from the shop and has not been seen at her lodgings. St Vincent wants them to find her. The Beresfords take on the case, which Tuppence solves with ease. Janet is a friend of hers from her wartime nursing days who was working at the shop where Tuppence makes her purchases. She asked Janet to mention the \\"Blunts\\" and then disappear. St Vincent would ask them to take on the case, for which they receive favourable publicity, and when they find Janet, his happiness will provoke St Vincent into a proposal of marriage to Janet. =The Affair of the Pink Pearl= Tommy sorts out a pile of famous detective stories, and he thinks it would be a good idea to base their techniques on the styles of their fictional counterparts. He has bought a good camera for taking photographs of footprints and \\"all that sort of thing\\". The next client is a young woman named Miss Kingston Bruce. She lives in Wimbledon with her parents, and last night one of their guests lost a valuable pink pearl. The Blunts have been recommended to them by Lawrence St Vincent, who was one of the guests. The Beresfords travel to Wimbledon and meet Colonel Kingston Bruce. He proudly tells them that Lady Laura Barton, daughter of the late Earl of Carroway, is staying with them together with an American couple, Mr and Mrs Hamilton Betts, who wanted to meet a titled lady. During a bridge game after dinner, the clasp of Mrs Betts' pearl pendant necklace broke. She laid it down on a small table and forgot to take it upstairs. The next morning, the necklace was still there but the pearl itself had gone. Aside from the Kingston Bruces, the Betts, Lady Laura, and St Vincent, the only other guest was Mr Rennie, paying court to Miss Kingston Bruce. Her father does not like him as he is a socialist. No one has been allowed to leave the house since the pearl was discovered to be missing, except for the daughter when she went to the Blunts. They search the house as part of their investigations. Tommy uses his new camera whilst Tuppence tactfully questions the servants. They overhear a scrap of conversation between Mrs Kingston Bruce and her daughter about someone hiding a teaspoon in their muff. Later on, Tuppence ferrets out of Lady Laura's French maid, Elise, that her employer is something of a kleptomaniac, and five times in the past items have gone missing when she has been staying at friends' houses. They search Lady Laura's bedroom and bathroom, momentarily getting stuck in the latter room when Elise cannot open the door. Tommy takes pictures in the bedroom with Elise's assistance and then quietly tells Tuppence that he has an idea and has to go out to pursue it. In the meantime, she is not to let Lady Laura out of the house. Tommy returns with Inspector Marriot of Scotland Yard. They go straight back to the bathroom and cut the cake of soap in half. Inside it is the pearl. The reason Elise could not open the door was that she had soap on her hands after depositing the pearl there. Tommy's photographs included one of the maid and she handled one of the glass slides, leaving her fingerprints. Scotland Yard has identified her from their records as a missing criminal and arrested her. Being the maid of a lady suspected of kleptomania was the best cover she could have had. =The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger= Tuppence receives a package with an engraved silver cigarette case she bought for General Francis Haviland whom she drove in the First World War; it is her wedding gift to him. Tommy's disparaging remarks about the General are interrupted by the arrival of the post and the first of the expected blue Russian letters. Their perusal of the letter is interrupted by the arrival of a large man with a club foot who states that he is Dr Charles Bower of Hampstead. Twice in the last week he has been summoned away to an urgent case but on each occasion the call has been a hoax. On arriving back home, he has found signs that his study has been carefully searched in his absence, probably for papers relating to his studies of alkaloids, these papers being securely held in a secret drawer in his desk. He has now received another summons, this time to a patient in Bournemouth, but in checking on this summons he has found it to be another decoy. Bower therefore expects that another search of his study will be made tonight, and wants Blunt to be there when the third attempt is made. Bower leaves, and his club foot reminds Tuppence of the brothers Okewood. Tommy resolves to be Desmond while she is Francis. Their next visitor is Detective Inspector Dymchurch from Scotland Yard, a colleague of Marriot, who understands the need to keep a watch on the blue letters and is following Bower. The doctor's real purpose is to decoy the Berefords away from their office that night in order that it can be searched and the latest letter retrieved. Tommy and Dymchurch make another plan to return to the office that night and catch the agents in the act. They do so but it is a trap, and Tommy is bound. Dymchurch is a foreign agent accompanied by several of his men. Bower (real spelling, Bauer) is one of his gang. He threatens Tommy with torture to reveal the whereabouts of the blue letter. Tommy tells them that Tuppence has it, and writes a letter summoning her to the office; but he signs this \\"Francis\\" and shows them the General's wedding present as proof that this is his real name and not \\"Theodore Blunt\\". Tuppence arrives and alerted by the false name in the note, she has brought Inspector Marriot with her and several armed policemen. \\"Dymchurch\\" and his co-conspirators are arrested. =Finessing the King/The Gentleman Dressed in Newspaper= While reading the 'Daily Leader' newspaper, Tuppence decides that she wants to go dancing. A reluctant Tommy tries to distract her attention by pointing out to her the interesting fact that dots in the masthead of the newspaper indicate the different days on which the paper was produced, while his wife spots an advert in the personal column which reads, \\"I should go three hearts. 12 tricks. Ace of Spades. Necessary to finesse the King.\\" She deduces that this refers to the Three Arts Ball the next evening, \\"12 tricks\\" means twelve o'clock midnight and the \\"Ace of Spades\\" refers to a somewhat decadent nightclub-cum-eating place in Chelsea where it is fashionable to go to after events like the Three Arts Ball. Curious about \\"Necessary to finesse the King\\" and feeling that they need to hone their detective skills, she decides that she and Tommy will go the ball in costume to investigate. They will act as the detectives Tommy McCarty and Dennis Riordan. At the Ace of Spades, the Beresfords sit in a private booth and peer through the door at the various other costumed and masked patrons. The booth next door is soon taken by a woman dressed as Alice's Queen of Hearts and a man outfitted as the gentleman dressed in newspaper. After a while, they hear a cry from the woman followed by the man laughing and then see him leaving. After a few minutes, suspicious, Tuppence makes Tommy follow her into the booth and they find the woman stabbed through the heart. She whispers, \\"Bingo did it\\", before she dies. The next day, Inspector Marriot brings Sir Arthur Merivale, the husband of the dead woman, Lady Vere Merivale, round to the Beresford's flat. \\"Bingo\\" Hale is known to both of them and he is stunned that his best friend could have killed his wife. Hale had been staying with them and was arrested that morning for murder. Merivale is perplexed as to what the motive could have been and is incensed at the suggestion from Marriot that the two were lovers and that Vere was threatening Hale who was paying attention to a rich American woman. Tuppence shows Sir Arthur the advert from the Daily Leader and the way the two communicated with each other using this device. Before she died, Vere tore off a piece of Bingo's newspaper costume and the police intend to match this up with the discarded costume. Marriot returns to the Beresford's with photographs of the fragment and the section of the costume it came from; he has the last link to convict Hale but Tuppence senses that he is far from satisfied with this conclusion to the case. After he leaves, she notices that the dots in the masthead of the two pieces do not match. They invite Sir Arthur back round and confront him with the evidence. Tuppence puts it to him that he too was at the Ace of Spades, dressed in a nearly identical masked costume. Hale says that he was slipped a note asking him not to approach Vere and he complied. Sir Arthur took his place and killed his own wife. The man laughs at this suggestion and Tuppence recognises it as the same laugh she heard from the booth. Marriot is hidden in their flat listening in, but Sir Arthur Merivale throws himself from a window and falls to his death before he can be taken. Marriot tells them that the motive was not jealously but money. Vere Merivale was the one in the marriage with the money, and if she had left her husband he would have been destitute. =The Case of the Missing Lady= The International Detective Agency receives a visit from Gabriel Stavansson, the famous explorer, who has returned early from a two-year expedition to the North Pole. Tommy and Tuppence impress him with their initial display of observational and deductive powers (because they read of his return in the Daily Mirror earlier that day) and he entrusts his case to them. Stavansson explains that before he went on the expedition, he became engaged to the Hon Mrs Hermione Leigh Gordon, whose first husband was killed in World War I. His first thought on returning was to rush to London and see his fianc√©e who had been staying with her aunt, Lady Susan Clonray, in Pont Street. Lady Susan is surprised to see him and proves evasive about her niece's whereabouts, saying that she was moving between friends in the north of the country. Stavansson and Lady Susan had never really got on well, partially due to his dislike of fat women like her, and partially due to his perception that she disapproved of the engagement. He requests the names and addresses of the various people that Hermione was supposed to visit, and travels north to see them. None had had recent contact with his fianc√©e. Lady Susan seems genuinely upset when told this news, but a telegram arrived as she and Stavansson were talking, signed by Hermione and addressed from Maldon, saying she was going to Monte Carlo. Stavansson travelled to Maldon but is unable to find her, prompting his visit to Blunt's International Detective Agency. Taking up the case, Tommy and Tuppence travel to Maldon themselves and draw a similar blank on the whereabouts of the missing woman. It is then that Tuppence realises that there are two Maldons ‚Äì where they are in Surrey, and another place of the same name in Sussex. They travel there and find an isolated private nursing home near the village. Investigating this lead, Tuppence inquires at the nursing home and is told they do not have a patient named Mrs Leigh Gordon. Next, Tommy poses as a journalist seeking an interview with Dr Horriston, but he too is turned away. Next, the sleuths overhear a conversation which sends each in a different direction. Tommy leaves Tuppence to keep watch while he goes to make some phone calls in the village. Upon his return he shares the news that Dr Horriston has a reputation as \\"a most unscrupulous quack...\\" After dark, the two return to the house. Tuppence ascends a ladder to a second floor window, where she sees a woman strapped to the bed and writhing in pain. She recognises the woman as Mrs Leigh Gordon. While Tuppence is watching, a nurse enters the room and injects the woman with an unknown substance. Tuppence informs Tommy of what she has seen and then ascends the ladder again, leaving him to keep a look out while she tries to free the woman. A few moments pass and Tommy is startled by a hand upon his shoulder, but it is Tuppence, having left by the front door of the house. She informs Tommy that the case is solved. Hermione Leigh Gordan is at the nursing home by choice for a quick weight loss program. The only problem is that Stavansson has returned early, just at the time she had started the treatments. Feeling foolish, the young detectives leave quickly, with Tommy commenting that there is no need to place the case in their records, in the fashion of Sherlock Holmes, as \\"It has absolutely no distinctive features.\\" =Blindman's Buff= Tommy receives a phone call from Mr Carter warning him and Tuppence that the people connected with the Russian letters on blue paper have become aware that they have taken Blunt's place, and to expect developments any time soon. Tommy suggests Tuppence waits in the safety of their home but she refuses. Tommy suggests an exercise in following the methods of the blind detective Thornley Colton. He dons a pair of black eyeshades and practises (badly) his awareness of his surroundings by use of his other senses. Tommy decides he and Tuppence will go for lunch at the Blitz hotel so that he can practise further in the surroundings of the restaurant. At the Blitz, they are soon joined by two men who have been observing the pair and who say that Blunt has been pointed out to them, although one of them admits he did not know Theodore Blunt was blind. They have been to the office and learned they were at lunch, and by coincidence have stopped at the same restaurant. One man introduces himself as the Duke of Blairgowrie and his friend is Captain Harker. The Duke's daughter has been kidnapped \\"under somewhat peculiar circumstances\\" which mean that he cannot call in the police, and he wants Blunt to accompany them to his house immediately. Tommy agrees, but not before he has drunk a cup of coffee and given Tuppence instructions for a meal at the hotel tomorrow, at which he will dine with the French Prefect of Police. That done, they leave with Tommy and the Duke taking a different car to that of Captain Harker and Tuppence. It is a trap and the \\"Duke\\" is connected with the Russian letters. He prods a pistol at Tommy and takes him to a hideout where he is bound to a chair while the \\"Duke\\" gloats over him. He tells Tommy that the floor of the room they are in is metal and now electrified. He is going to make Tommy walk across the floor, even though he is blind. If he steps on a contact point, he will die. He hands him his white cane and unties him and the \\"game\\" is about to commence. Tommy coolly takes out a cigarette and match but he has anticipated the trap and instead lights a magnesium wire he is carrying. The flare blinds the \\"Duke\\" who lowers his pistol and then he finds himself at the point of Tommy's cane, which is a swordstick. Tommy reveals that his dark shades were false and he has been able to see all the time. The \\"Duke\\" springs forward with rage and steps on a contact point, dying instantly. Tommy escapes the house and rings Tuppence from a call box. She is safe. Tommy's \\"order\\" at the hotel was in fact a set of code words from Clinton H Stagg's stories for Albert to fetch help. Albert tailed Tuppence, and he and the police freed her from \\"Captain Harker\\". =The Man in the Mist= Tommy and Tuppence have had a setback, failing to solve their latest case involving a stolen pearl necklace. Instead, the local police inspector apprehended the culprit. Having withdrawn to lick their wounds with cocktails in a hotel, they meet an old acquaintance, Mervyn Estcourt, known as \\"Bulger\\", who is in the company of the famous actress Gilda Glen. She is renowned for her beauty and rumoured to be notable for her lack of intelligence. Miss Glen seems puzzled by Tommy's Father Brown disguise and Tommy ambiguously confirms his detective credentials. The directions from Bulger as to the way back to the station include a walk down Morgan's Avenue. Miss Glen is startled by this advice and Bulger laughs at her belief that the road in question is haunted by the ghost of a policeman who was killed and yet still walks his spectral beat. Miss Glen leaves hurriedly. Bulger tells them that she is engaged to marry Lord Leconbury, who meets the actress outside the door to the hotel. Bulger leaves soon afterwards and Tommy receives a note from Miss Glen asking for his help and for him to call on her at The White House, Morgan's Avenue, at 6.10 pm. A shabbily dressed and aggressive young man bursts into the hotel. Sitting near Tommy and Tuppence, he tells them that his name is James Reilly, and he is a pacifist poet enamoured of Gilda. She once cared for him, but does so no longer since her engagement to Lord Leconbury. Still angry, he leaves as suddenly as he arrived. Tommy and Tuppence walk to Morgan's Avenue, in a thick fog. Tuppence is startled when a policeman looms up out of the mist just near to the White House. Recovering herself, she sees Reilly enter the house. The policeman confirms that the house is the residence of Mrs Honeycott, and that he saw someone who resembles Miss Glen enter there a few minutes before. About to enter the house, they hear a cry and Reilly runs out, leaving what looks like red paint from his hand on a gatepost as he does so. The two enter the house and meet Ellen, the maid, who is indignant about the visit by Reilly. Then they meet Mrs Honeycott. Mistaking Tommy for a real priest, she asks for his help with Gilda who is her sister. Some twenty years before, at the age of seventeen, she married a man against the wishes of her family, and now wants a divorce to marry Lord Leconbury. Her husband is refusing to grant her this wish, although the marriage took place so long ago that Mrs Honeycott cannot remember his name. She confirms that it was Reilly whom she saw rush upstairs and as quickly down again. Tommy asks to be shown upstairs where they find Gilda's body, her head smashed in on one side by a blunt instrument. Tuppence fetches the policeman from outside. Questioning reveals that Mrs Honeycott heard her sister entering the house at eight minutes past six as she was re-setting the main clock. This agrees with the time at which the policeman himself saw the actress enter, just before Tommy and Tuppence walked up Morgan's Avenue. The next day, Reilly is arrested and Tommy and Tuppence meet with his solicitor, Mr Marvell. Reilly insists that the woman was dead when he entered her room. That would mean either Ellen or Mrs Honeycott killed her. Tommy suddenly realises no one inside the house saw Gilda enter, they only heard the door open. Before that the two women already in the house were in the kitchen, where they could not see or hear anyone entering with a key. Just because they heard the door banging, it does not prove anything. It could just as easily have been someone leaving the house, like the policeman they saw at the gate and who carries a truncheon, which would serve as the blunt instrument needed to carry out the deed, especially as the policeman was Gilda's husband of long-ago. =The Crackler= Blunt's detective agency is doing well. Tommy considers they may need a larger office, in part to accommodate the shelf- space needed to store the classics books by Edgar Wallace if they are to copy his methods of detection. Inspector Marriot calls on the two sleuths with his mission for them: A large number of well-forged one-pound notes are in circulation and he wants them to track down the source. The West End seems to be the starting point in England, and some have come from across the Channel). The police are especially interested in the activities of Major Laidlaw who is involved in horse racing circles. He and his French wife seem to have a lot of money. Although it could be a coincidence, a large number of the notes have come from a gambling club used by the Laidlaws and this, together with the racing, could be an ideal way of distributing the forgeries. Another friend of the Laidlaws is Lawrence St Vincent (from A Pot of Tea above) and Marriot thinks he could introduce the Beresfords into the set. Tommy and Tuppence make their plans to catch the head of the forgers, or 'The Crackler' as Tommy calls him, named after the sound that a rustled banknote makes. The two are soon ensconced in the Laidlaw's circle of friends. As well as the Laidlaws themselves, Mrs Laidlaw's French father, M. Heroulade, is an object of suspicion. They observe how notes are passed by the Laidlaws to lay their bets. Among each wad of notes there are some forgeries. Marguerite Laidlaw is a striking woman and has a string of admirers. Among them is a visiting wealthy American called Hank Ryder who tells Tommy that she is in fear of her husband. Ryder also notices the forged notes, as his bank rejected them. The next night Tommy is at the gambling club, Mrs Laidlaw passes him small notes to exchange for one of a higher denomination. Among them are several forgeries. His suspicions are directed to M. Heroulade, but his attention is caught when he leaves the club and finds Hank Ryder drunk in the street outside. In his slurred ramblings he tells Tommy how Mrs Laidlaw took him on a treasure hunt which included a visit to Whitechapel where she \\"found\\" five hundred pounds. Tommy takes Ryder to the district and the house they visited earlier. As the row of terraced dwellings look identical, Tommy chalks a small cross at the base of the back door before they enter. Ryder thinks he hears someone coming and goes back out to investigate. Tommy goes further into the house and finds the counterfeiting gang and The Crackler himself ‚Äì Hank Ryder. Ryder captures Tommy and tells him that he marked every door with a cross. Ryder's satisfaction is cut short when Marriot and the police burst into the room and arrest the gang. Tommy tells Ryder that when he was chalking the door, he emptied a bottle of valerian on the ground, thus attracting the neighbourhood cats to the smell. This was his pre-arranged sign to Albert who, on his orders, followed them to Whitechapel. =The Sunningdale Mystery= Tommy takes Tuppence to lunch at an ABC shop where he decides to mimic the tastes and habits of \\"The Old Man in the Corner\\" with Tuppence playing the part of Polly Burton. To test his abilities as this detective, he has brought along a cutting from a newspaper on the recent case known as the Sunningdale Mystery. Captain Anthony Sessle and Mr Hollaby, business partners and members of Sunningdale Golf Club, played a full round of golf on the course on a Wednesday and then decided to play a few more holes before it became dark. As they approached the tee on the seventh hole, Hollaby saw Sessle talking to a mysterious woman in a brown coat. They went off, talking, down a side path, and after a moment Sessle reappeared. Something had upset him for his game fell apart and two holes later Sessle gave up and walked off alone, presumably to his bungalow home. The existence of the woman in brown, Sessle's temporary departure with her, and his subsequent poor game were witnessed by two other members who were behind them on the course. The next morning, Sessle was found dead on the seventh tee, stabbed with a hatpin through the heart. The police found forensic evidence on the man that led them to trace a young woman called Doris Evans. She was arrested and told a story of meeting Sessle at a cinema. He invited her to his bungalow on a day when, as she learned later, his wife and servants would be away. On the day in question, the man met her as he arrived home from the golf course. He behaved strangely and then, suggesting a stroll, he took her to the golf course. On the seventh tee he suddenly became deranged and produced a revolver, wildly suggesting a suicide pact. Doris escaped his grasp and ran off. It has come to light that Sessle and Hollaby's assurance business is in liquidation and the funds embezzled. Over their table, Tuppence counters that Doris did not murder the man, as very few women nowadays use hatpins. That suggests that a man not conversant with fashions committed the crime and tried to frame a woman. Tommy soon remembers that near the seventh hole on the course is a small hut, and the two talk about the possibility that the woman in brown could have been a man in disguise. This leads them to wonder which man. Linked to Tuppence's theory that the embezzler of the company was not Sessle but Hollaby and his son, they speculate that the woman was Hollaby Junior in disguise. They reconstruct the crime: Hollaby's son in disguise lures Sessle away in full view of the other two players on the course. He stabs him with a hatpin and hides the body in a hut, changing into the coat of the dead man. The two witnesses on the course see at a distance the deterioration in his game and \\"Sessle\\" then goes to his bungalow where he meets Doris Evans as arranged and goes through a series of actions which lead to the innocent woman being arrested. The Beresfords wonder how to convince the police of the plausibility of their theory. Inspector Marriot sits at the next table, listening intently to them. He was suspicious of the Hollabys and promises to set enquiries in motion. =The House of Lurking Death= The Beresfords receive a professional visit from a smartly dressed young woman, Lois Hargreaves of Thurnly Grange, her house in the country. One week before, her household received a box of chocolates anonymously through the post. Not liking chocolates, she did not eat any, and consequently she was the only one who was not taken ill afterwards. The cause was arsenic poisoning and this is the third occurrence in the area of such a gift and its after-effects. What perturbs Miss Hargreaves is that the paper in which the chocolates were wrapped was re-used from a previous parcel sent to the Grange, evidenced by a small doodle of three intertwined fish that she drew on it. The poisoner is therefore someone in her own home. Miss Hargreaves is a rich heiress. She inherited her fortune from her aunt, the wealthy widow Lady Radclyffe. Lady Radclyffe had invited Lois to live with her, and she always made it clear to Lois that she intended to leave the bulk of her estate to Dennis Radclyffe, her late husband's nephew. After a quarrel with the young man she quietly changed her will in favour of Lois. Three weeks earlier, when she turned 21, Lois made a will leaving her money to Dennis. He lives at the Grange with her, as does Miss Logan, an old lady who is a cousin of Dennis and a former companion to Lady Radclyffe. Mary Chilcott, an old schoolfriend of Lois, is also living at the Grange. The servants are a cook, a kitchenmaid, a parlourmaid called Esther, and an elderly maid called Hannah. The next day, Tommy and Tuppence plan to travel down to the Grange; before leaving, they read the news that Lois is dead, killed by a poison which also affected Dennis and Miss Logan. The source is fig paste in sandwiches eaten by the three but not by Mary Chilcott, who is unaffected. They meet Dr Burton who is looking after the patients and who tells them that Dennis died early that morning. The doctor has not yet identified the poison, but it was not arsenic. They learn that Dennis was out when the sandwiches were eaten for tea. Tuppence finds that he was seen by one of the maids to drink a cocktail, and gets hold of the glass before it is washed. In speaking with everyone in the house, they meet Hannah, who quotes dark lines from scripture, bringing fire and brimstone on all concerned. She has an old book on poisons and medicines by Edward Logan, Miss Logan's father, a pioneer of serum therapeutics. They confirm this from the ill old lady. Tuppence notices that she has a mass of small pinpricks on her arm. They call at Dr Burton's and find out that the poison is ricin and, from the entry in Edward Logan's book, deduce that Miss Logan is the murderer. The pinpricks on her arm are from injections of small amounts of the poison she has been giving herself to build up immunity. As next of kin to Dennis, she would inherit once Lois, then Dennis, died. The near-mad Hannah hears this accusation and then bursts into Miss Logan's room and attacks her, starting a fire in the process. Tommy stifles the flames but the shock of this event causes Miss Logan to die. Dr Burton confirms that the cocktail glass contained traces of ricin. =The Unbreakable Alibi= Tommy and Tuppence's latest client is a personable, rich, but slightly dense young man called Mr Montgomery Jones. He has met an Australian woman called Una Drake with whom he has fallen violently in love. Talking of their mutual love of detective stories, she has made a bet with him that he cannot break an alibi she has set up for herself. She has agreed that if he wins he can ask her for anything he likes, and it is his intention to ask her for her hand in marriage. Knowing full well that he is not known for his intelligence, Montgomery Jones asks the Beresfords to take on the task for him. The alibi is that on the previous Tuesday Miss Drake dined at a Soho restaurant, saw a West End show, and then had supper with a Mr le Marchant at the Savoy Hotel. At the same time, she stayed the night at the Castle Hotel in Torquay and returned to London the next morning. Armed with a photograph of Miss Drake and the knowledge of the methods of Inspector French, Tommy and Tuppence interview Mr le Marchant who confirms that he was with the young lady for part of the evening in question. He states that Miss Drake made an oblique comment about being in Devonshire at the same time, which he considers strange since a friend of his was at the Castle Hotel and did indeed think he saw her there. The two investigate the Soho restaurant (where a positive identification of the young woman is not forthcoming). They travel to Torquay where they find plenty of evidence that Miss Drake was in the hotel throughout the night and that she traveled to the resort when she was in London. Back in London, they finally question some people who saw Una at the Savoy, and also her flatmate and charwoman, who both attest that she spent the night in her own bed. Working all evening on puzzling out the problem, the Beresfords confess that they are stumped. Sleeping on the problem, the next morning Tuppence awakes to a flash on inspiration and sends off a cable to test her idea. Later that day she returns to their office with the solution ‚Äì Una has a twin sister who, the cable to Australia has confirmed, arrived in England the day before the events in question. The fun-loving sisters thought the stunt would be an amusing joke to play on Montgomery Jones. =The Clergyman's Daughter / The Red House= Illustration by Arthur Ferrier of Tommy and Tuppence from the December 1923 issue of The Grand Magazine and the first-known image of the characters It is just before Christmas when a young lady called Monica Deane calls at Blunt's agency. She and her impoverished, widowed, invalid mother inherited a house from a well-off sister of her father's. They expected to inherit some money to go with the house but, to their surprise, there was little forthcoming. They didn't want to sell the house as it provided plenty of room for them compared to their small flat. They made plans to open the house to paying guests to supplement their income. All went well for a time until they started to have strange occurrences with pictures falling off walls and crockery being smashed when no one was in the room ‚Äî a poltergeist, which scared their guests and their income away. A Dr O'Neill from the Society for Psychical Research has visited and offered to buy the house from them to further his investigations. Monica, however, is certain that he is the younger man (now in disguise) who previously made them an offer for the house. The only other resident in the house now is Crockett, an elderly maid of Monica's aunt who has a young nephew of whom she is very proud. Tommy and Tuppence travel to the \\"Red House\\" and begin their investigations, harbouring suspicions that the old lady had hidden money in the building that would account for the remainder of her fortune being missing. Tommy makes a visit to the local bank and finds out from the manager that the aunt withdrew all of her money before she died. Under the guise of potential buyers, they explore the house and Monica gives them papers of her aunt's. Before they can investigate these further, they hear a crash and find a jug and basin broken in a room overhead. They quickly interview Crockett and notice that she is out of breath. They mention to her that they intend to buy the house. Monica receives a message soon afterwards from \\"Dr O'Neill\\" that his own offer has increased. It is obvious that the old maid is the one creating \\"disturbances\\" and that the \\"Doctor\\" is her nephew, trying to get the house so that he can investigate the location of the missing fortune. Tommy and Tuppence look over the papers and realise that one of them contains a puzzle anagram. They work it out and the solution is \\"potatoes\\". Another of the papers, on the theme of recipes, refers to the trick of burying new potatoes in a tin to keep them fresh for the winter; they realise that this is their lead. They question the gardener to see if the old lady ever used this technique and find out that she did. They dig in the spot and find several tins of potatoes and, in one of the tins, a bag containing two hundred pounds in gold sovereigns, twenty thousand pounds in banknotes, and a string of expensive pearls. Monica Deane and her mother will have their fortune, and the Deanes and the Beresfords will celebrate a happy Christmas. =The Ambassador's Boots= The Blunt's agency is visited by Randolph Wilmott, the United States Ambassador to Great Britain. He arrived back from a trip to his home country a week ago. Soon after his return, his valet informed him that his kit bag, which carried his initials, had been mistakenly taken by another passenger on board the liner with the same initials ‚Äì Senator Ralph Westerham, also from the US ‚Äì but quickly returned by that man's valet. The puzzle is that Mr Wilmott met Mr Westerham yesterday and the Senator denied the mistake, stating that he did not have such an article amongst his luggage during the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Mr Wilmott knows the matter is a trivial one, but his curiosity has been piqued and he wishes the agency to investigate. At Mr Wilmott's invitation, the Beresfords visit the US Embassy and speak to Richards, his valet, who confirms the basics of the tale told by the Ambassador. Just before the other valet called for the bag, he had started to unpack it and had glimpsed its contents. It contained boots and toilet things, and a tin of bath salts. Tommy wonders if the Ambassador's bag could have been tampered with on the voyage, and Richards recalls the incident of a young lady called Eileen O'Hara being taken ill just outside the Ambassador's cabin, and he having to fetch a doctor for her, leaving the cabin alone. When he returned with the medical man, the patient seemed fine. Tommy decides that their next line of action is to advertise for Miss O'Hara to come forward, even though they risk putting her on her guard if she was involved in tampering with the kit bag. Two days later, Albert shows into Tommy's office a Miss Cicely March who is answering the advertisement, but before she can relate what she knows they are interrupted by a big, dark, Spanish-looking man who holds them up at gunpoint. He has followed Miss March, having recognised her as a passenger on the liner, and he suspects that she is about to meddle in his plans. Before he can carry out any of his threats, he is accosted by Albert and disarmed. Tommy throws him out, deciding not to involve the police. Alone with Tommy, Miss March tells a tale of having also seen the incident of Miss O'Hara on the liner: The supposedly ill woman, when she thought she was alone and unobserved, went into Mr Wilmott's cabin and put something into the lining of a boot through a slit which she cut. Worried about what she had done to the boot, Miss March later went into the empty cabin and extracted the object from the lining. It was a slip of paper with verses from the Bible; but only yesterday, by accident, the paper became wet, revealing hidden writing that looks like the plans of a harbour. The paper is back at her place of work ‚Äì a beauty parlour in Bond Street where she is the US agent for preparations used in beauty treatments. Tommy leaves a note for Tuppence, and he and Miss March go to her beauty parlour. Preparing to take a taxi, Tommy notices that the cab has just refused a fare further down the road and, suspicious that they are being watched, insists on walking to Bond Street. Once there, they pass through the front of the shop, past a woman customer and two waiting men, and go into a back office where Tommy is immediately set upon. Rescue is instant, however, as the woman in the front of the shop is Tuppence and the two men are policemen, alerted by Tommy's note. He noticed a look of disappointment on Miss March's face when their assailant at the agency was overcome, and realised she was in the enemy's camp. He had also worked out that it wasn't the ambassador's bag that was important; rather, a different bag was in the ambassador's possession for an hour or two, thereby bypassing customs for reasons of diplomatic immunity. Tommy delayed their arrival at the parlour to give Tuppence and the police time to get there first. They search the premises and find tins of bath salts which contain cocaine. =The Man Who Was No. 16= Mr Carter congratulates the Beresfords on their successes at the agency, but he gives them a warning that Moscow has become suspicious of the failure to hear from their agents, and that they have despatched a man to investigate. The agent is known to them, having caused them problems in the past, but he is master of disguise and linguistics. He is also the deviser of the \\"No. 16\\" code and they expect him to turn up at Blunt's ‚Äì although he has never met the real Theodore Blunt and doesn't know that Tommy has been impersonating him. The Beresfords are given other known codes to watch out for and are asked to co-operate as much as they can with \\"No. 16\\" to help Carter get to him. The two go back to the agency where they find that too many leaves have been torn from a calendar so that it now shows the date as Sunday the sixteenth, which is six days hence. Albert tells them that could only have been done by a client who waited for some time for them that morning ‚Äì a hospital nurse. After a short while, another client is shown in ‚Äì a fair, bearded man who goes by the name of Prince Vladiroffsky, and who starts to use the codes communicated to them by Mr Carter. Upon being questioned, the Beresfords tell him that treachery is afoot. \\"No. 16\\" assumes that Tuppence is an agent known as \\"Marise\\" and suggests that she lunch with him at the Blitz hotel, and that they then meet Tommy later on at Headquarters. They leave and Tommy communicates with Mr Carter, whose men have been listening in to the conversation in the office. Going to the Blitz, the \\"Prince\\" and Tuppence dine, served by waiters, some of whom are policemen in disguise. They then go up in the lifts to the \\"Prince\\"'s suite, but when they fail to appear some time later, the lift man tells Tommy and Mr Carter that he took them to a different floor instead. They have been spotted going into the room of a Mrs Van Snyder of Detroit and, breaking into this room, they find the room's occupant bound and gagged. \\"No. 16\\" took Tuppence through into an adjoining room booked by an invalid Frenchman and his nurse (more agents of No. 16) and made his escape that way with Tuppence as a hostage, drugged and disguised as the invalid. Tommy is distraught at the thought of what might be happening to Tuppence. Albert tries to cheer him up, reminding him of Tuppence's resourcefulness. In talking to Albert, Tommy is struck by an idea and races back to the Blitz where he and one of Carter's men return to Mrs Van Snyder's room. They find the lady still there, recovering on the bed. Under the bolster on the bed, Tommy finds Tuppence ‚Äì he realised that there wasn't enough time to bind and gag Mrs Van Snyder, drug Tuppence, and disguise her as a Frenchman. Therefore, she must still have been in the room and, remembering the bolster as a hiding place from childhood games, saw that as the only place she could be. He also unmasks \\"No. 16\\" ‚Äì disguised as Mrs Van Snyder. Tuppence quickly recovers and the two decide to give up the agency, after Tuppence tells a delighted Tommy that she is expecting a baby. Literary significance and reception The review of the book in the Times Literary Supplement's issue of 17 October 1929 seemed to recognise the tongue-in-cheek nature of the work when it stated that \\"Mrs Christie has given an amusing twist to the episodes by suggesting that the two partners in \\"Blunt's Brilliant Detectives\\" assume on each occasion the method, the manner of speech, and the outlook favoured by some well-known detective of fiction. Holmes, Thorndyke, Father Brown and even Poirot are amiably parodied, and once or twice the solution as well as the dialogue is deliberately facetious.\\" The review ended by saying that \\"the author is incorrect in the explanation she gives of the printer's marks on newspapers, the distinction of dates which she makes really being one of editions\\". The review in The New York Times Book Review of 22 September 1929 began by observing \\"To describe adequately such a book as this is no easy matter. It is a group of short detective stories within a detective novel, for there is a rather sketchy, but nonetheless absorbing plot which holds the separate tales together. The entire book and the separate stories may be taken as hilarious burlesque or parodies of current detective fiction, or they may be taken as serious attempts on the part of the author to write stories in the manner of some of the masters of the art. Taken either way they are distinctly worth while.\\" The review concluded that \\"The result is the merriest collection of detective stories it has been our good fortune to encounter.\\" The Scotsman of 16 September 1929 said, > Detective fiction, like mathematics, tends to develop a language of its own > which to the uninitiated can be a little troublesome. It is not so much a > matter of 'blue-nosed automatics' and other jargon of the craft of detective > fiction; the trouble is that many of the writers seem to have little command > of English and cannot make their characters speak naturally. Agatha Christie > is a notable exception. In this volume of stories she has conceived the > ingenious idea of setting her two amateur detectives ... to work out their > problems after the fashion of various heroes of detective fiction. This > enables her to parody the methods of various writers ... in a way that is > most enjoyable, for her literary skill is equal to the task. At the same > time the stories are genuinely detective stories. They are well wrought and > ingenious. The writer has the saving grace of humour and she does not let > her detectives win too easily. By having two detectives who are usually > alternately successful she has always a foil, less obtuse than 'my dear > Watson'. The Daily Express issue of 10 October 1929 gave the book a review of a couple of lines which concluded that the stories were \\"not quite up to her level, although they are entertaining enough\\". Robert Barnard described this as: \\"Tommy and Tuppence in a series of short stories which parody detective writers and their methods. Many of these are long forgotten, but the parodies are not sharp enough for this to matter very much. The House of Lurking Death anticipates the solution of Dorothy L. Sayers's Strong Poison.\\" References or Allusions =References to other works= Illustration from Through the Looking-Glass * The reference regarding the Gentleman Dressed in Newspaper character as being from the Lewis Carroll Alice books is mistaken in that the character who appears in chapter three of Through the Looking-Glass is described as being dressed in white paper only. However John Tenniel's illustration (right) of the character in the book reminded many contemporary readers of Benjamin Disraeli, and there has been speculation as to whether this was a comment upon his constant presence in newspaper columns. William Empson in his 1935 book Some Versions of Pastoral referred to \\"Disraeli dressed in Newspapers\\". *In The House of Lurking Death, Hannah quotes a series of religious and personal threats. Direct quotes from the Bible and their sources are: :‚Ä¢ From Psalm 18: \\" I will follow upon mine enemies and overtake them, neither will I turn again till I have destroyed them\\" :‚Ä¢ From the Gospel of John, 3:8 \\" The wind bloweth where it listeth\\" :‚Ä¢ From Psalm 1: \\"The ungodly shall perish\\" :‚Ä¢ From Psalm 37: \\"But the wicked shall perish\\" \\"The fire of the Lord shall consume them\\" is not a direct quote but resembles numerous lines throughout the Bible. *Tommy's final line to Tuppence at the end of The House of Lurking Death (\\"It is a great advantage to be intelligent and not to look it\\") is a quote from A. E. W. Mason's story At the Villa Rose. (In the Christie story, Tommy assumes the role of Mason's detective, M. Hanaud.) *In The Ambassador's Boots, Tommy refers to a mention by Sherlock Holmes of a case not yet documented by Watson which hinged on the depth to which the parsley had sunk into butter on a hot day. This alludes to The Adventure of the Six Napoleons by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, first published in 1904. At the time that The Ambassador's Boots was written and first published, Conan Doyle was still writing Sherlock Holmes stories (the last was published in 1927) and therefore Tommy's wish that \\"Watson will disinter it from his notebook\\" was a real possibility at that time. *The reference to Bee-keeping and Vegetable Marrow-growing in The Man Who Was No. 16 are humorous allusions to the retirement plans of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. =References to actual history, geography and current science= *In A Fairy in the Flat, Tommy and Tuppence look at a blemish on a photograph, the shape of which resembles a fairy, and Tuppence suggests writing to Conan Doyle about it. This is a reference to the Cottingley Fairies, a media cause c√©l√®bre of the early 1920s, centred on five photographs. The photographs, taken by two girls, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, in Cottingley, West Yorkshire, supposedly showed fairies at the bottom of their garden. Conan Doyle believed the photographs were real and wrote a famous article about the incident which appeared in the November 1920 issue of the Strand Magazine. *In The Case of the Missing Lady, Tommy refers to a concert at the Queen's Hall that he and Tuppence should attend. This hall, built in 1893, was destroyed in an air raid in World War II. It is most famous for being the first home of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts. *In Blindman's Buff and The Man Who Was No. 16, the Blitz Hotel is a play on words on London's Ritz Hotel. Christie uses the same location (and the same name for it) in the 1925 novel The Secret of Chimneys. *In The House of Lurking Death, Lois Hargreaves admits to a habit of doodling a design of three intertwined fish. This design was used on the set of the collected works of Christie begun by William Collins in 1967 (but never completed) and this was approved by Christie in the spring of 1966 in discussions with the publishers. Although it has been stated by some that the doodle was a habit of Christie herself, the design was apparently spotted by her in the bazaars of Baalbek on a visit in the 1930s. The same design was used in the title sequence of the television series Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime (see below) and Why Didn't They Ask Evans? (1980). Film, TV or theatrical adaptations =Television= The Case of the Missing Lady (1950) from Partners in Crime aired as the twelfth episode in the twenty-six episode anthology series The Nash Airflyte Theater on Thursday, 7 December 1950 (possibly under the title of The Disappearance of Mrs Gordan). The 30-minute live transmission on CBS was at 10:30 pm from New York City. There are differing accounts of who starred in the adaptation. Peter Haining states that the stars were Barbara Bel Geddes as Tuppence and Lee Bowman as Tommy but other sources state that the stars were Ronald Reagan and Cloris Leachman The adaptation was written and directed by Marc Daniels. In 1983, a ten-episode television adaptation called Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime was made by London Weekend Television with James Warwick as Tommy, Francesca Annis as Tuppence, and Reece Dinsdale as Albert. It was first broadcast in the UK between 16 October 1983 and 14 January 1984. In 2015, BBC television adapted ‚ÄúThe Secret Adversary\\" and \\"N or M?\\" as two, three part stories starring David Walliams and Jessica Raine. One six-part series aired as Partners in Crime beginning on 26 July 2015 in the UK. =Radio= Partners in Crime was adapted as a 13-part radio serial broadcast on the BBC's London, Midland and Scottish Home Service from Monday, 13 April to Monday, 13 July 1953. The half-hour episodes starred Richard Attenborough as Tommy and Sheila Sim as Tuppence, taking advantage of the actors' then-current starring roles in The Mousetrap. Oscar Quitak appeared in all episodes as Albert. Aside from a 1948 adaptation of Ten Little Niggers, this was the first adaptation of a Christie book for radio in the UK.

For publication in book form, Christie rearranged the story order and changed the framing device of several of the chapters to make the flow of the book easier. The original order and publication details of the stories are as follows: * The First Wish: First published in issue 226 of The Grand Magazine in December 1923. This formed the basis for chapters 20 and 21 of the book ‚Äì The Clergyman's Daughter / The Red House. The story was illustrated by Arthur Ferrier. * Publicity: First published in issue 1652 of The Sketch on 24 September 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 1 and 2 of the book ‚Äì A Fairy in the Flat / A Pot of Tea. This was the first in a sequence of twelve consecutive stories Christie wrote for The Sketch which appeared under the subtitle of Tommy and Tuppence. * The Affair of the Pink Pearl: First published in issue 1653 of The Sketch on 1 October 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 3 and 4 of the book which uses the same chapter title. * Finessing the King: First published in issue 1654 of The Sketch on 8 October 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 7 and 8 of the book ‚Äì Finessing the King / The Gentleman Dressed in Newspaper. * The Case of the Missing Lady: First published in issue 1655 of The Sketch on 15 October 1924. This formed the basis for chapter 9 of the book which uses the same chapter title. * The Case of the Sinister Stranger: First published in issue 1656 of The Sketch on 22 October 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 5 and 6 of the book which use the slightly amended title of The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger. * The Sunninghall Mystery: First published in issue 1657 of The Sketch on 29 October 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 15 and 16 of the book which use the slightly amended title of The Sunningdale Mystery. * The House of Lurking Death: First published in issue 1658 of The Sketch on 5 November 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 17 and 18 of the book which use the same chapter title. * The Matter of the Ambassador's Boots: First published in issue 1659 of The Sketch on 12 November 1924. This formed the basis for chapter 22 of the book which uses the shortened title of The Ambassador's Boots. * The Affair of the Forged Notes: First published in issue 1660 of The Sketch on 19 November 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 13 and 14 of the book using the different title of The Crackler. * Blindman's Buff: First published in issue 1661 of The Sketch on 26 November 1924. This formed the basis for chapter 10 of the book which uses the same chapter title. * The Man in the Mist: First published in issue 1662 of The Sketch on 3 December 1924. This formed the basis for chapters 11 and 12 of the book which uses the same chapter title. * The Man who was Number Sixteen: First published in issue 1663 of The Sketch on 10 December 1924. This formed the basis for chapter 23 of the book which uses the same chapter title and was also the final story Christie ever wrote for The Sketch. After a gap of four years a final story, The Unbreakable Alibi, appeared in Holly Leaves, the annual Christmas special of the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News in December 1928. This formed the basis for chapter 19 of the book. =Book dedication= As with most of Christie's short story collections, this book carried no dedication. =Dustjacket blurb= The blurb of the first UK edition (which is carried on both the back of the dustjacket and opposite the title page) reads: > This delightfully witty book will come as a pleasant surprise to all > admirers of these ingenious detective thrillers for which Agatha Christie is > famous. It tells the story of the amazing adventures of two amateur > detectives ‚Äì Tommy, a remarkable young man of thirty-two, and his equally > remarkable wife, Tuppence ‚Äì who follow the methods of famous detective > heroes, such as Sherlock Holmes, Inspector French, Roger Sherringham, > Bulldog Drummond, Father Brown and even Monsieur Poirot himself. Problem > after problem comes before them for solution, and the account of their > endeavours to live up to their slogan, 'Blunt's Brilliant Detectives! Any > case solved in twenty-four hours!' makes delicious reading. The blurb was incorrect in that \\"Sapper's\\" Bulldog Drummond stories were not parodied, although the character and the situations that he encountered were briefly mentioned in The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger.

History Matmatah in Saarang in 2005 The band was established in 1995 when Stan, who at the time was a student pursuing study of Advanced Mathematics in Brest (western Brittany, France), met Sammy who was studying electric engineering in the same city, where they both come from. Both were guitarists and together formed a chanson and guitar duo called the Tricards Twins, playing in a number of bars and pubs in Brittany. They developed a repertoire for playing songs from the sixties and seventies, with the Beatles, Neil Young and Simon and Garfunkel figuring prominently among their influences. In one of their shows, they met bassist Eric and drummer Fanch. Together, they formed Matmatah, named after Matmata, the village in Tunisia in which Stan had lived during his childhood. Soon, they achieved some success, opening for bands such as FFF. Their first single, including two songs, \\"Lamb√© An Dro\\" and \\"Les Moutons\\" (The Sheep), was released in 1997, and within a few months had sold 30,000 copies. The Band's first studio album, titled La Ouache, elevated them from local fame to national revelation. The album sold 300,000 copies within six months (800,000 in total). The media frenzy for the band began after they embarked on a marathon of hundreds of concerts over the next two and a half years. During this time they were part of a number of rock festivals, during which fans discovered a new side to Matmatah through their energy on the stage and their covers of various Beatles songs. It was around the same time that Matmatah were charged with inciting the use of illegal narcotics because of some of their songs' lyrics and were ordered to pay a fine. With their usual sense of humour, the band brought up the issue in the lyrics of their second album. This eagerly awaited album did not prove to be as much of a success. Titled Rebelote (Here We Go Again), it brought the band closer to its Celtic Rock origins, but was less popular. However, the artists maintain that through that album they turned away from the \\"schoolboy-ish\\" form of rock and towards the spirit which drives them today. In 2001, the band released their live album, Lust for a Live, and a DVD humorously entitled Piste Off. After a short rest period during which the band changed drummer they resumed their touring, this time for a number of humanitarian causes. Their third studio album, Archie Kramer, released in October 2004, was very successful. Singles such as Casi El Silencio and Au Conditionnel enjoyed extensive airtime in France. The twelve tracks veer between soft ballads and energetic rock numbers. Their soft folk song, Alzheimer expresses their opposition of American hegemony in the world. At the end of October 2004, the band went on a comprehensive tour, including parts of Asia. In 2007 their fourth studio album La Cerise (The Cherry) was released which is also the title of the first single. Matmatah disbanded in August 2008 after a series of farewell gigs. In September 2016, the group reformed and a tour started in February 2017.

The dates given are Julian day numbers. V1500 Cygni or Nova Cygni 1975 was a bright nova occurring in 1975 in the constellation Cygnus. It had the second highest intrinsic brightness of any nova of the 20th century, exceeded only by CP Puppis in 1942. V1500 Cygni was discovered on 29 August 1975, and reached an apparent brightness of magnitude 1.7 on the next day. It remained visible to the naked eye for about a week, and 680 days after maximum the star had dimmed by 12.5 magnitudes. It is an AM Herculis type star, consisting of a red dwarf secondary depositing a stream of material onto a highly magnetized white dwarf primary. The distance of the V1500 Cygni was calculated in 1977 by the McDonald Observatory at 1.95 kiloparsecs (6,360 light years). Additionally, V1500 Cyg was the first asynchronous polar to be discovered. This distinction refers to the fact that the white dwarf's spin period is slightly different from the binary orbital period.

Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p 15) The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition at eight shillings and sixpence (8/6, 42¬Ωp). It features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and gives an account of twelve cases with which he intends to close his career as a private detective. His regular associates (his secretary, Miss Lemon, and valet, George/Georges) make cameo appearances, as does Chief Inspector Japp. The stories were all first published in periodicals between 1939 and 1947. In the Foreword to the volume, Poirot declares that he will carefully choose the cases to conform to the mythological sequence of the Twelve Labours of Hercules. In some cases (such as The Nemean Lion) the connection is a highly tenuous one, while in others the choice of case is more or less forced upon Poirot by circumstances. By the end, The Capture of Cerberus has events that correspond with the twelfth labour with almost self-satirical convenience. Plot summaries =Foreword= Hercule Poirot is enjoying a social visit by Dr. Burton, a fellow of All Souls, who recites sonorously some lines from Homer's Iliad (XXIII, 316 f) and turns the conversation round to the subject of Poirot's unusual Christian name and how some of the pagan names parents give to their children do not suit their recipients. He thinks about Poirot's and Sherlock Holmes's mothers sitting together and discussing names for their children. Poirot claims ignorance of the legend of Hercules. The talk turns to Poirot's intention to retire after completing a few cases of interest and personal appeal and Burton laughingly refers to the twelve labours of Hercules. This comment gives Poirot pause for thought and after his visitor has gone, Poirot gets acquainted with the exploits of his legendary namesake, deciding his final cases will mimic Hercules' Twelve Labours. =The Nemean Lion= Miss Lemon, Poirot's secretary, finds the first of the labours in a letter from a bluff outspoken businessman, Sir Joseph Hoggin, whose wife's Pekingese dog has been kidnapped. Poirot meets Hoggin, who tells him the dog was taken a week ago but returned for a ransom of two hundred pounds. Hoggin would have left the matter there but for the fact that the same thing had happened to an acquaintance at his club. Poirot meets the petulant Lady Hoggin and her put- upon companion, Miss Amy Carnaby, who is clearly frightened of her employer. Miss Carnaby took the yapping dog, Shan-Tung (described by Poirot as \\"a veritable lion\\"), for his walk in the park and she stopped to admire a baby in the pram. When she looked down, someone had cut the dog's leash and it had been taken. A ransom note said to leave the money in notes in an envelope for a Captain Curtis at an address in Bloomsbury. Poirot begins his investigations. Having ascertained the name of Miss Carnaby's previous employer, Lady Hartingfield who died a year before, he visits her niece who confirms Lady Hoggin's view of Miss Carnaby's lack of intellect but essential good qualities, looking after an invalid sister and being good with dogs, so much so that Lady Hartingfield left her Pekingese to her. Poirot interviews the park keeper who remembers the incident of the kidnap. He then investigates the address to which the ransom money was sent and finds it is a cheap hotel where letters are often left for non-residents. His third visit is to the wife of the man that Hoggin met at his club who gives a very similar story to that told by Lady Hoggin as to the method of kidnap and ransom demand. His last visit is back to Sir Joseph to report on progress, where he observes that Sir Joseph's relationship with his blonde secretary is not exactly on a professional level. Poirot sends his valet out investigating and finds an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions of where it would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. They are part of a scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find his way back to the sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the \\"crime\\". The \\"subject\\" of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and its owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers ‚Äì only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin, although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police. Poirot meets Sir Joseph and offers two alternatives: prosecute the criminal (whom he does not name), in which case he will lose his money, or just take the money and call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter. =The Lernaean Hydra= Poirot is asked for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a practice in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died just over a year ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip ‚Äì like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim is to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits that a lot of the talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said what and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently awaiting. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicine or a pot of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them. Poirot does obtain permission for an exhumation and the body is proved to be riddled with arsenic. Nurse Harrison is shocked and tells Poirot a new story of seeing Jean filling up a make-up compact with a powder from the dispensary. Poirot alerts the police who find such a compact in the bureau of the bedroom of Jean's lodgings. They show it to Nurse Harrison who excitedly confirms that is the one she saw ‚Äì only for Poirot to tell her that such compacts have only been manufactured for three months. Further, his valet, George, followed her some days previously, witnessing her purchase of a compact at Woolworths and then seeing her travel to Jean's lodgings to secrete it there. Trapped and broken, Nurse Harrison admits the murder. Poirot speaks to Jean and tells her that the conversation Nurse Harrison claimed to have overheard seemed psychologically unlikely as two possible conspirators would never had had such a conversation in a place where they could be easily listened to. He observed the nurse's positive reaction when he told her of a possible exhumation and then had her followed by Georges who witnessed the buying of the compact and the laying of the trap for Jean. The motive was jealousy as Nurse Harrison was convinced by Oldfield's kind manner over several years that he intended her to be his bride. =The Arcadian Deer= Poirot is diverted to stay in an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he does not appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing in front of the fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man ‚Äì Ted Williamson ‚Äì is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called Grasslawn to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita, but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and is told that the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-eyed and bad-tempered. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of Grasslawn, Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie, with some unease, but does not recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective does not take up the offer, much to her annoyance. Poirot speaks to his contact in the theatre world who tells him the dancer has gone to Vagray Les Alpes in Switzerland, suffering from tuberculosis, and that her maid was an Italian from Pisa. Poirot travels to Pisa to find from her family that Nita Valetta, whom they call Bianca, had had appendicitis and had died on the operating table. Poirot has seemingly reached the end of his quest, but something troubles him and he moves on to Switzerland where he finds Samoushenka in poor health. She confirms Poirot's suspicions that Marie Hellin was blackmailing Sir George Sanderfield, and that Marie's predecessor, Nita, has died. Poirot points out that Nita's family called her Bianca. He notices Katrina's golden hair and puts it to her that on the visit to Sanderfield's house in June, she was between maids ‚Äì Bianca had left and Marie had not yet been employed. Samoushenka was, in fact, Nita, or \\"Incognita\\" to give her a full name, and she enjoyed several hours of pleasure in Arcady with her Greek god when he called at the house and the others were out. She does not deny his story. Then, he convinces Katrina to start a new life with Williamson. His quest for the Arcadian deer is at an end. =The Erymanthian Boar= Poirot is still in Switzerland after solving the third labour. Sightseeing, he takes a funicular to the mountain-top hotel of Rochers Neiges. On the way up, his ticket is checked by a conductor who passes him a hurriedly scribbled note that is from Lementeuil, the Swiss Commissaire of Police. It tells Poirot that he has been recognised because of his moustache and asks for his help. Marrascaud, a Parisian gangster, has fled from his homeland after the killing of Salley, a bookmaker, and is believed from information received to be having a rendezvous with members of his gang at Rochers Neiges. Poirot considers the note; Marrascaud has been the prime suspect in many killings but this is the first time that his guilt is beyond doubt. Although he is annoyed that his holiday is being delayed, the phrase used by Lementeuil to describe Marrascaud ‚Äì \\"a wild boar\\" ‚Äì catches his interest. He sees in this the fourth of his self- imposed labours. Poirot observes his fellow passengers in the funicular. There is a friendly American tourist called Mr Schwartz, a beautiful but melancholy woman, a distinguished-looking man reading a book in German and three criminal types playing cards. Arriving at the hotel, they find it somewhat in chaos as it is only just opening at the start of the season. To Poirot, the hotel manager seems in too much of a nervous panic; the only efficient person is Gustave, the waiter. Talking to the manager and then to Schwartz again, Poirot learns that the beautiful woman is a Madame Grandier, who comes each year on the anniversary of her husband's death in the area, and that the distinguished-looking man is Dr Lutz, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis in Vienna. Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M. Drouet, a police inspector. They are now cut off in the hotel as the funicular has been damaged during the night, probably by sabotage. Poirot and Gustave discuss who Marrascaud could be among the guests and staff, which includes Jacques, the cook's husband. Poirot is intrigued as to why a rendezvous has been arranged in such an isolated place. Poirot speaks to Jacques and his wife and discovers that before Gustave, there was another waiter, called Robert, who was dismissed for incompetence but who was not witnessed leaving the hotel. That night, the three card-playing men attack Poirot in his room, but he is saved by the pistol-carrying Schwartz. The three men are locked up and Schwartz tells Poirot that the men have already \\"carved up\\" Gustave's face. Schwartz and Poirot find Dr Lutz attending the not too seriously injured detective, and then follow a bloody trail down the carpets of the hotel to an unused wing where they find a dead body with a note pinned to it which reads \\"Marrascaud will kill no more, nor will he rob his friends\\", Poirot uses a heliograph to signal down the mountain for help and three days later, Lementeuil and some officers arrive at the hotel and Gustave is arrested. Poirot announces that Gustave is not Drouet but Marrascaud. It was \\"Robert\\" who was Drouet; Marrascaud killed him and took his place. We learn that during his first night in the hotel, Poirot did not drink his coffee, as he suspected it was drugged, and actually witnessed Gustave entering his room, rifling his pockets, and finding the note from Lementeuil. The three card players were members of Marrascaud's gang but never attacked their leader; the carve-up of Marrascaud's face was carried out by Dr Lutz (who is a plastic surgeon and not a psychiatrist as he has pretended) to change his appearance. This is the real reason the rendezvous took place in such an isolated spot. =The Augean Stables= Poirot is asked to help the prime minister, Edward Ferrier, whose predecessor in the role was his father-in-law John Hammett, now Lord Cornworthy. He was held up as an exemplary role model as to what an honest and honourable politician should be. However, beneath the surface he was involved in chicanery, dishonest share-dealing and misusing party funds. These revelations have come as a shock to his son-in-law who forced Hammett to resign on the grounds of ill-health and then took up the post himself. The revelations are about to be revealed to the public by a scandal sheet of a newspaper called The X-Ray News when Ferrier is attempting to clean up public life. Poirot is uninterested until the Home Secretary, Sir George Conway, uses the phrase \\"The Augean Stables\\" at which point he agrees to assist. Poirot visits Percy Perry, the seedy editor of The X-Ray News who he has heard has previously accepted sums of money for not printing stories. On this occasion, however, Perry refuses money and says he will publish. Soon afterward, along with the stories about Hammett, another series of news reports start to appear in the press which hint at various sex scandals regarding Ferrier's wife, Dagmar. They paint a picture of her as wanton and cavorting at clubs with a South American gigolo. These stories appear in The X-Ray News, which is sued for libel by Mrs Ferrier. The prosecution provides its first witness ‚Äì the Bishop of Northumbria ‚Äì who swears that Mrs Ferrier was at his palace recovering on doctor's orders on the dates mentioned by the newspaper. The second witness is a lady called Thelma Anderson who states that she was approached by a man who said he worked for The X-Ray News and employed her to impersonate Mrs Ferrier. She was then photographed in various compromising situations. Mrs Ferrier wins her libel case easily and in doing so makes the public assume the rumours about Hammett were also fabricated. Poirot reveals to an astonished Ferrier that the idea to use Thelma Anderson was his and that Dagmar was in on the plan. The idea came from Alexandre Dumas, p√®re's book, The Queen's Necklace, but the real inspiration was \\"The Augean Stables\\" when Hercules uses a force of nature ‚Äì in his case a river ‚Äì to clean the stables out. Poirot used sex as the force of nature, first blackening Mrs Ferrier's name and then clearing her in a public fashion, resulting in a wave of sympathy which also reflected well on her father and destroyed The X-Ray News. =The Stymphalean Birds= Harold Waring, an under-secretary of state at age 30, is enjoying a holiday in the country of Herzoslovakia at a hotel by the side of Lake Stempka. The only other English people there are an elderly woman, Mrs Rice, and her married daughter, Mrs Elsie Clayton. Two other women cause Harold a moment of disquiet. He first sees them as they come up a path from the lake to the hotel. They are dressed in flapping cloaks, have hooked noses and long fingernails and bring to Harold's mind an image of evil birds of prey. Chatting to Mrs Rice, Harold finds out that her daughter is not widowed, as he supposed, but is in an abusive marriage. Her husband, Philip, drinks, is insanely jealous and has a vicious temper. Her daughter's character is slowly being destroyed by this relationship. Mrs Rice has also found out from the hotel concierge that the two evil looking women are Polish sisters. One morning, Harold finds Elsie sitting on a log in the woods, crying about the state of her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel unexpectedly and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow. Harold is aghast, worried if the foreign police will believe the story both he and Elsie have to tell and that their \\"relationship\\" is innocent. The evidence points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has an idea and wonders if the hotel management and the police are open to bribery. Harold agrees to give it a try and wires for money but, apart from that, and unable to speak the local language, he leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people. Harold is walking by the lake when he encounters Poirot. Desperate, he confesses what has happened. Poirot sees an immediate link between the two Polish women and the Stymphalean Birds. Poirot promises to help and the next day he tells Harold that he has been successful and that the blackmailers have been dealt with. He found out by telegram that they were wanted by the police and that they have been arrested. Harold is relieved but suddenly spots the two Polish women and wonders what is going on. Poirot tells him that, although not particularly attractive, they are of good family and background. The true culprits are Mrs Rice and her daughter. \\"Philip Clayton\\" has never existed and the man Harold saw \\"killed\\" was Mrs Rice in disguise. No foreign police are open to bribery in the way that Harold was told. He provided all the money and was innocent of what Mrs Rice \\"negotiated\\" as he did not speak the language. Harold resolves to learn every European language from now onwards. =The Cretan Bull= Poirot is asked for assistance by a young lady, Diana Maberly. She was engaged to marry Hugh Chandler for over a year but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, has insisted his son leave the Navy before his condition worsens, but the reason was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate ‚Äì a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but insists it has nothing to do with the situation. The Admiral refuses to let a doctor see his son. Poirot travels with Diana to the family seat of Lyde Manor where he meets the people involved. Hugh strikes Poirot as a fine young bull of a man. He learns further details of the history of insanity in the family from Colonel Frobisher, including Hugh's grandfather who was committed to an asylum. Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before he went off to India with the British Army. When he came home, he learned she had married Admiral Chandler; however, this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the washbasin but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking that there will be no more Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died. In questioning Hugh, Poirot hears of his dreams which always seem to include elements of hydrophobia. He also suffers from hallucinations and has one while speaking to Poirot of seeing a skeletal figure in the garden. Poirot, however, is convinced that Hugh is sane and begins his investigations, asking Diana to arrange for him to spend the night in the manor. He searches Hugh's room and also makes a trip to a local chemist, supposedly to buy a toothbrush. That night, Hugh somehow manages to get out of his locked room and is found outside Diana's room, a bloodied knife in his hands from having killed a cat. Hugh recovers consciousness, is shocked to hear what has happened and tells the others that he intends to go out shooting rabbits. It is clear that his real intention is to commit suicide in the woods with a shotgun and therefore save himself and the others from further pain. Poirot stops him and tells them all that Hugh is being set up to commit suicide. He is being poisoned with Datura. The alkaloid produces hallucinations and causes great thirst. It is being given to Hugh as part of his shaving cream and thereby continually entering his system with each day's application. Poirot took a sample to the chemist for testing. As to who is responsible ... Poirot reveals that Admiral Chandler has inherited the insanity of his family but Hugh is not his biological son. Hugh is the natural son of Colonel Frobisher who had an affair with Mrs Chandler before he went to India. The Admiral recognised the resemblance in his son to his friend and learned the truth from his wife before she died in that curious \\"boating accident\\". He blocked Hugh from seeing a doctor who would have confirmed his sanity. Hearing this explanation from Poirot of the facts of the case, the Admiral, who is now described in the narrative as \\"the last of the Chandlers\\", briefly speaks a pro forma denial. He takes the shotgun and says that he is going rabbit shooting. He is last seen entering the woods with the gun, and a shot is fired. =The Horses of Diomedes= One night, Poirot is telephoned for help by a young medical acquaintance, Dr Michael Stoddart. Going to the address given to him, Poirot finds Stoddart in the flat of Mrs Patience Grace, where a debauched party is ending, including use of cocaine. Stoddart had been summoned after Mrs Grace had an argument with her boyfriend, Anthony Hawker. She tried to shoot him as he left the flat, and inflicted a flesh wound on a passing tramp. Stoddart patched up the tramp who has accepted a pay-off. Stoddart's concern is for Sheila Grant, who he met at a hunt ball in the country. Sheila was at the party, is still at the flat having just woken up and is feeling terrible after the high of the drugs. She is one of four daughters of a retired general and there is every sign that Sheila and her sisters are going wild, getting into a bad set where the cocaine flows freely. Stoddart lectures her about the cocaine and Poirot introduces himself. It is obvious that Sheila has heard of him and is nervous of him. Poirot compares drug-peddling to feeding on human flesh (in his mind, like the horses of Diomedes, who were fed on human flesh). Poirot visits Mertonshire, where an old friend, Lady Carmichael, gives him details of the Grant family. All the girls are going to the bad as their father cannot control them. They keep company with Hawker, who has an unpleasant reputation, as does another of his \\"lady friends\\", Mrs Larkin. Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clich√©d picture, sitting in an armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is leading his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host. Poirot has himself invited to a party at Mrs Larkin's home where he meets Sheila's sister Pamela. Hawker arrives with Sheila, having just come from a hunt, wanting to fill up his liquor flask. Sheila has heard from one of the house servants that Poirot visited her father the day before. He tells her of the threat she is under from her drug taking. As he leaves he hears Pam whisper to Sheila about the flask. Poirot sees the abandoned flask and finds it full of white powder. Some time later, back at Lady Carmichael's, Poirot tells Sheila that her photograph has been identified by the police. Her real name is Sheila Kelly. The four girls are not the daughters of General Grant, who is not a general, but head of a drugs ring, and the four young women push the drugs for him. He tells an astonished Michael that the \\"General\\" overdid his act, as gout is usually suffered by very old men, not the middle-aged fathers of young women. When Poirot tripped deliberately, he bumped Grant's \\"gouty\\" foot, but Grant did not notice. Hawker was not a pusher of drugs but a user. Pam and Sheila were trying to frame him on Grant's orders with the flask of cocaine. Poirot persuades Sheila to give evidence against Grant and thereby smash the ring. By doing so, she will copy the horses of the legend, who became normal after Hercules fed their master to them. Poirot tells an embarrassed Stoddart that Sheila is certain to lose her criminal tendencies with him to look after her. =The Girdle of Hippolyta= Alexander Simpson asks Poirot to help in the investigation of a painting by Rubens which was stolen from the gallery that he owns. A group of unemployed men were paid to carry out a demonstration in the gallery which, once it was cleared by the police, was found to have been a diversion to enable the picture to be cut out of its frame. Simpson knows the picture is being transported to France where it will be bought by a millionaire collector and he wants Poirot to assist as he thinks he will be better at dealing with an unscrupulous rich man than the police will be. Poirot reluctantly agrees to help. He is far more interested in a case that Japp has about Winnie King, a fifteen-year-old English girl who was being escorted to Paris as one of a party of such girls for the new term at Miss Pope's exclusive school there. On the way back from the dining car of the train, just after it left Amiens (the last stop before Paris), Winnie King went into the toilet and seemingly vanished. No body has been found by the side of the tracks and the train made no other stops, only slowing down for a signal. However, Winnie's hat was later recovered near the tracks. Poirot asks if her shoes have been found. Some time later, Japp phones Poirot and tells him Winnie has been found about fifteen miles from Amiens. She is in a daze, has been doped according to the doctor who examined her, and is unable to remember much after setting off from her home town of Cranchester. She remembers nothing of meeting one of Miss Pope's staff, Miss Burshaw, in London before the trip to France. Despite the girl being found, Poirot speaks with Detective Inspector Hearn, who has been dealing with the case and is no nearer to solving the mystery of how the girl disappeared. The only other people in the carriage seemed clear of suspicion ‚Äì two middle-aged spinsters, two French commercial travellers from Lyon, a young man called James Elliot and his flashy wife, and an American lady about whom very little is known. He is able to confirm that Winnie's shoes were found by the rail line which confirms Poirot's theory. Poirot goes to France and visits Miss Pope's establishment at Neuilly. The formidable headmistress tells Poirot of the advantages of her school being close to the music and culture of Paris. He hears how two sets of Parisian police asked to search through Winnie's trunk, neither seemingly having spoken to the other, and sees a badly painted picture in oils depicting the bridge at Cranchester, executed by Winnie as a present for Miss Pope. In front of the startled woman, Poirot begins to scrub the picture with turpentine whilst telling her that Winnie never made the trip across to France. Miss Burshaw met a girl in London whom she had never seen before, and who then totally changed her appearance in the toilette on the train, discarding the schoolgirl hat and shoes through the window and transforming herself into the flashy wife of James Elliot. At the same time, Poirot has stripped away Winnie's \\"dreadful\\" painting to expose a second one beneath it: the Girdle of Hippolyta, the missing Rubens masterpiece. The thieves smuggled the painting in an escorted schoolgirl's trunk, knowing such a thing would never be searched by customs, and one of the gang then threw off her disguise of a plain schoolgirl. Other members of the gang, disguised as policemen, could search the trunk later and retrieve the painting. They did not know that Miss Pope, who insisted on trunks being unpacked upon arrival, would find the \\"present\\" and take possession of it immediately. When Poirot leaves, the girls swarm around him asking for his autograph which Poirot refers to as the attack by the Amazons. =The Flock of Geryon= Poirot is reacquainted with Miss Carnaby, the companion from the episode of the Nemean Lion, whom Poirot praises as one of the most successful criminals he has ever met. She is worried as she constantly thinks of illegal schemes which she is sure would work and she fears she is turning into a hardened criminal. She wants to put her talents to good use and assist Poirot in fighting crime in any way she can. She also has brought to him a possible case in which she can prove herself. She has a friend, Mrs Emmeline Clegg, a widow who is comfortably off. In her loneliness, Mrs Clegg has found comfort in a religious sect called \\"The Flock of the Shepherd\\", based in a retreat in Devon. Their leader, Dr Andersen, is a handsome, charismatic man. Mrs Clegg has made a will leaving all of her property to the Flock. Miss Carnaby is especially concerned as she knows of three women in a similar situation who have all died within the past year. She has investigated and found nothing unusual in the deaths, all of which were due to natural causes and none of them happened within the sanctuary but at the homes of the deceased. Poirot asks Miss Carnaby to infiltrate the sect. She is to pretend to be dismissive of them and then, once within the sanctuary, be persuaded to be a convert. Poirot consults Japp. The Scotland Yard detective finds out that Andersen is a German chemist, expelled from a university there by the Nazis because he had a Jewish mother and that there is nothing suspicious about the deaths of the women whose names have been supplied by Miss Carnaby. Nevertheless, Poirot views Andersen as the monster Geryon whom he is determined to destroy. Miss Carnaby settles down at the sanctuary with Mrs Clegg and joins in a festival held at night ‚Äì \\"The Full Growth of the Pasture\\". At the service, she is dismissive of the liturgy but suddenly feels a needle-prick in her arm. Almost instantly she starts to experience a feeling of well-being and euphoria which makes her sleep for a short while. Poirot instructs her to tell Andersen that she is going to come into a large sum of money that she will leave to the Flock, that she has problems with her lungs, and that Mrs Clegg will soon inherit a large sum from an aunt, more than her present estate. Poirot also asks if she has met a Mr Cole at the sanctuary. Miss Carnaby has and to her he is a very strange man. As if to prove her assertion correct, soon afterwards Mr Cole accosts Miss Carnaby with tales of his strange visions which involve virgin sacrifices, Jehovah and even Odin. She is saved from further strange tales by the arrival of Mr Lipscombe, the lodge-keeper of the Devonshire estate. The day before the next divine service, Miss Carnaby meets Poirot in a local teashop. She seems to have had an about-face and tells Poirot that Andersen is a great man and that she cannot betray him. She rushes out of the shop and Poirot sees that a surly-looking man has been listening in to their conversation. The next service is proceeding and Miss Carnaby is about to be injected again when Mr Cole steps in. There is a fight and the police pour into the room. Mr Cole is in fact Detective Inspector Cole and he arrests Andersen. Later the parties confer. The man in the teashop was Mr Lipscombe and when Miss Carnaby recognised him, she put on an act of allegiance to Andersen. Poirot realised this when he had the man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about. The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided. =The Apples of Hesperides= Poirot receives a visit from Emery Power, a rich art collector of Irish birth. Ten years ago he purchased at auction a gold goblet which was supposedly made for Pope Alexander VI by Benvenuto Cellini, which the Borgia Pope used to poison his victims. The design of the goblet is a coiled serpent, surrounding a tree bearing apples represented by emeralds. Poirot is immediately interested at the mention of apples. Power paid a sum equal to thirty thousand pounds to buy it at auction in 1929, but on the night of the sale the goblet and other items were stolen from the home of the seller, the Marchese di San Veratrino. The police at the time were certain that a gang of three international thieves were responsible. Two of the men were captured and some of the stolen items recovered but the goblet was not among them. A third man, an Irish cat burglar called Patrick Casey, died soon afterwards when he fell from a building attempting another crime. Power has spent ten years and a lot of money trying to locate the goblet but without success. The Marchese has offered to refund his money but Power does not want to take advantage of this offer as he would no longer be the legal owner of the goblet should it be found. He had suspected that the real criminal was Sir Reuben Rosenthal, who was his rival bidder at the auction in 1929, but they recently became business allies and Power is now convinced Rosenthal is innocent. Poirot takes up the commission and interviews the detective on the case, Inspector Wagstaffe, about the suspects. Patrick Casey's wife, a strict Catholic, is dead. His daughter is a nun in a convent and his son, who took after his father, is in jail in the United States. There are many leads connected with the gang which stretch all over the world and Poirot sets his inquiries in motion. Three months later, Poirot goes to visit the convent which Casey's daughter entered, in a remote part of the western coast of Ireland. He discovers that she had died two months earlier. Poirot makes the acquaintance of one of the locals who helps him break into the convent, where he recovers the goblet. He returns it to Power and tells him that the nuns were using it as a chalice. Casey's daughter probably took it there to atone for her father's sins and the nuns were ignorant of its ownership and ancient history. Poirot deduced it would be at the convent as there had been no trace of anyone having the goblet after it was stolen. Therefore, it was somewhere where \\"ordinary material values did not apply\\". The mention of Casey's daughter being a nun supplied the obvious place. Poirot shows Power how, during the Renaissance, the Pope used a hidden mechanism in the goblet to put the poison in the victim's drink. Poirot suggests no good will come of owning an object with such an evil history. If it is given back to the convent, the nuns will say masses for Power's soul. He reminds Power of his boyhood in western Ireland. Power agrees; he has got what he wants, which was to own the goblet. Poirot returns the goblet to the convent as the gift of a man so unhappy he does not know he is unhappy. =The Capture of Cerberus= Poirot is leaving the London Underground at Piccadilly Circus when he passes an old acquaintance, the Countess Vera Rossakoff, on the escalators, going in the opposite direction. She insists that they meet and when asked to suggest a place, responds \\"In Hell‚Ä¶!\\" Poirot is puzzled but it is the unflappable Miss Lemon who coolly informs him it is the name of a new London nightclub and books him a table for that night. The club is in a basement and is decorated in styles of hell as represented by different cultures. It even has a large black, vicious-looking hound at the entrance called Cerberus. Rossakoff introduces him to Professor Liskeard who advised her on the decorations (although he is ashamed of the gaudy results), and to Dr Alice Cunningham, a practitioner of psychology who is engaged to Rossakoff's son, currently working in America. Alice and Poirot do not get along. She is coldly interested in criminal tendencies and finds Rossakoff's kleptomania interesting, but to Poirot's chagrin, she does not seem at all interested in the legendary detective. His questioning of her manner of dress with her heavy coat and pocketed skirt instead of a more feminine style of clothing does not go down well. However, Alice does find an individual called Paul Varesco fascinating. He is a good-looking lounge lizard with a very dubious reputation and she spends time dancing with him, questioning him incessantly about incidents in his childhood which could have contributed to his personality. Poirot recognises a young Scotland Yard detective in the crowd in evening dress and feels that something is going on. Seeing Japp the next day, Poirot's suspicions are confirmed. The club is being watched by the police as they have linked it to a drugs ring. They cannot trace the person who put up the money to buy the club but they do know the drugs are being paid for by jewellery. Rich ladies swap their stones for paste imitations and drugs, later denying they knew of the substitution when they contact the police and their insurance companies. Scotland Yard has traced the work done on the jewels to a company called Golconda, and from there to Paul Varesco. Under the guise of picking up a wanted murderer, the police raided the club but were unable to find any jewels or drugs secreted in the club or on anyone there, particularly Varesco. Poirot questions Rossakoff about the true owner of the club. She denies that anyone else is the owner, but she is horrified to be told of its drug connection. Japp tells Poirot of another plan to raid the club and Poirot makes his own arrangements. On the night of the raid, Poirot stations a small man called Higgs outside the club. The morning after the raid, Japp phones Poirot to tell him they found jewels in the pocket of Professor Liskeard but that he had been set up. However, no drugs were discovered so someone must have removed it from the club. Poirot tells the astonished Japp that he was responsible, and then puts the phone down. Rossakoff arrives at Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that she put the jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and so she had to dispose of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the otherwise fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her ‚Äì the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth ‚Äì and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof. Literary significance and reception No review of this book appeared in the Times Literary Supplement. Maurice Richardson, in the 5 October 1947 issue of The Observer wrote briefly, > the Queen of Crime tries the difficult, unrewarding sprint form.

Adaptation The Labours of Hercules was adapted into a TV film by Guy Andrews with David Suchet as Poirot as part of the final series of Agatha Christie's Poirot. The adaptation combined \\"The Arcadian Deer\\", \\"The Erymanthian Boar\\", \\"The Stymphalean Birds\\", \\"The Girdle of Hippolyta\\" and \\"The Capture of Cerberus\\" into one mystery, with \\"Boar\\" being the central one. The plots of \\"Deer\\" and \\"Birds\\" are included fairly faithfully, while only elements from the others are present. Minor elements of \\"The Nemean Lion\\", \\"The Augean Stables\\" and \\"The Lemesurier Inheritance'\\", the only Poirot short story not previously adapted by the series, were also included in this adaptation. It was first broadcast on ITV on 6 November 2013 and then on the Acorn TV website on 18 August 2014. Unlike in the novel, the titular Labours are not undertaken by Poirot as cases, but rather refer to a series of paintings that are stolen by Marrascaud, the main villain; the title is also symbolic of Poirot's path to redemption after his plan to snare Marrascaud leads to the senseless murder of an innocent girl, Lucinda LeMesurier. The most significant departure from the source material is the change in Marrascaud's identity, the only time when the identity of the murderer has been changed throughout the series; in the book it is Gustave who is Marrascaud, but in the adaptation it is Alice Cunningham (who is changed not to be Rossakoff's daughter-in-law, but a biological daughter), with Gustave being her accomplice, along with Dr Lutz. The adaptation marks the second and final appearance of Countess Vera Rossakoff in this series, played here by Orla Brady. The previous appearance was broadcast in 1991, in the episode \\"The Double Clue\\", where Kika Markham played Rossakoff. Filming for this episode took place in April and May 2013 and was directed by Andy Wilson, who also directed Death on the Nile and Taken at the Flood for the series. Wilson described this adaptation as \\"a journey of restoration and redemption for Poirot\\". The location in this adaptation, a Swiss hotel called \\"Hotel Olympos\\", was shot in Halton House in Aylesbury; however, the bedrooms were built at Pinewood studios.

Specifically it would be a type of gas core reactor rocket that uses a quartz wall to separate nuclear fuel from coolant/propellant. It would be operated at temperatures of up to 22,000¬∞C where the vast majority of the electromagnetic emissions would be in the hard ultraviolet range. Fused silica is almost completely transparent to this light, so it would be used to contain the uranium hexafluoride and allow the light to heat reaction mass in a rocket or to generate electricity using a heat engine or photovoltaics. This type of reactor shows great promise in both of these roles. Rocket engine As a rocket engine it, like all nuclear rocket designs, can greatly exceed the exhaust speed and specific impulse of a chemical rocket. However, it also does not involve the release of any radioactive material from the rocket, unlike open cycle designs which would cause nuclear fallout if used in a planetary atmosphere (e.g. Project Orion). The theoretical specific impulse (Isp) range from 1500 to 3000 seconds. Electrical Power generation As a method to generate electricity, nuclear lightbulbs are extremely efficient because higher-temperature heat contains more Gibbs free energy than the low-temperature heat produced in current fossil-fuel plants and water-cooled nuclear reactors.

Plot summaries =The Affair at the Victory Ball= Chief Inspector Japp asks Poirot to assist Scotland Yard in the strange events which took place at a recent costumed Victory Ball. A group of six people, headed by the young Viscount Cronshaw, attended dressed in the costume of the Commedia dell'arte. Lord Cronshaw was Harlequin, his uncle, the honourable Eustace Beltane, was Punchinello and Mrs Mallaby, an American widow, was Punchinella. In the roles of Pierrot and Pierrette were Mr and Mrs Christopher Davidson (he being a stage actor) and finally, Miss \\"Coco\\" Courtenay, an actress rumoured to be engaged to Lord Cronshaw, was Columbine. The night went badly from the start when it was obvious to the party that Cronshaw and Miss Courtenay were not on speaking terms. The latter was crying and asked Chris Davidson to take her home to her flat in Chelsea. When they had gone, a friend of Cronshaw's spotted Harlequin in a box looking down on the ball and called up to him to join them on the main floor. Cronshaw left the box to join them but then disappeared. He was found ten minutes later on the floor of the supper room, stabbed through the heart with a table knife, his body strangely stiff. Coco Courtenay is found dead in her bed from an overdose of cocaine; at the inquest that followed, it was found that she was addicted to the drug. Poirot starts to investigate, finding out to everyone's puzzlement that Cronshaw was emphatically opposed to drugs, that Beltane's costume had a hump and a ruffle and that a curtained recess exists in the supper room. He arranges a get- together of the people involved at his flat where he puts on a shadowed presentation across a back-lit screen of the six costumes but then reveals that there were actually five. Underneath Pierrot's loose garb is that of the slimmer-fitting Harlequin. Davidson leaps forward and curses Poirot but is quickly arrested by Japp. Poirot reveals that the strength with which the knife was plunged into Cronshaw meant that a man was responsible for the crime. The stiffness of the body meant he had been dead for some time and not killed in the ten-minute interval between being seen in the box and then being found dead on the floor, therefore the figure seen as Harlequin was one of the others. It could not have been Beltane as his costume was too elaborate to change quickly. Davidson killed Cronshaw earlier, hid the body in the curtained recess, then took Courtenay home where he fed her an overdose of the drug. He did not stay there as he claimed but returned immediately. His motive was self-preservation as it was he who had been supplying Courtenay with drugs and Cronshaw was on the point of finding out and exposing him. =The Adventure of the Clapham Cook= Poirot is not interested in investigating some of the cases which appear in the newspapers and which Hastings tries to bring to his attention. These include a bank clerk (Mr. Davis) who disappears with fifty thousand pounds of securities, a suicidal man and a missing typist. He is put on the spot though when visited by a Mrs Todd who is determined that he investigate her missing cook. Challenged, he decides, with some humour and to avoid an argument, to take the seemingly trivial case. Eliza Dunn, a middle-aged woman, walked out of her job and the Todd's house in Clapham two days ago without working her notice and has not communicated with her employer since, except for sending for her trunk that day. Interviewing the maid in the house, Poirot finds out that the trunk was already packed, meaning that Eliza had planned to leave even though her departure was swift. The other occupants of the house are Mr Todd, who works in the city, and their lodger, Mr Simpson, who works in the same bank at which Mr Davis worked. Struck by this coincidence as he is, Poirot cannot see a connection between an absconding bank clerk and a missing cook. Poirot places advertisements in the newspaper enquiring as to the whereabouts of Eliza and several days later he is successful in locating her when she visits Poirot's rooms. She tells him a story of having come into a legacy of a house in Carlisle and an income of three hundred pounds a year, dependent upon her taking up the offer and immediately leaving domestic service. This legacy was communicated to her by a man who approached her in the street as she was returning to the Todd's house one night, the man supposedly having come from there to see her. The money came from a friend of her late grandmother who had settled in Australia and married a wealthy settler. Eliza had immediately taken the train north and a couple of days later received her belongings from Clapham, although wrapped in paper parcels and not in her old trunk, which she supposes had been kept behind by Mrs Todd in a fit of pique. Poirot rushes back to Clapham with Hastings and explains matters on the way. Simpson knew what his colleague Davis was up to at the bank. He killed the man for the securities and needed an old, inconspicuous trunk in which to hide the body and that meant diverting Eliza out of the way. It was Simpson in disguise who had approached her in the street. On arriving at Clapham, Simpson has already disappeared but is traced to an ocean liner bound for the US. The trunk with Davis' body inside is located at a Glasgow railway station. Poirot views the link between a disappearing cook and a murder to be one of his most interesting cases, and he frames the cheque sent by Mr. Todd for his consulting fee as a reminder of it. =The Cornish Mystery= Poirot receives a visit from a Mrs Pengelley, a middle-aged woman who is afraid that she is being poisoned by her husband, a dentist. She has been ill after eating but her doctor states that she is suffering from acute gastritis. She and her husband live in Polgarwith, a small market town in Cornwall. She has no proof of the allegation, only that she only suffers when her husband is at home, not when he is away at the weekends and a bottle of weedkiller, supposedly unused, is half-empty. There could be no financial motive to suggest why Mr Pengelley should try to murder his wife but she suspects an affair with his young receptionist. Another resident in the house was her niece, Freda Stanton, but that lady had a row with Mrs Pengelley the week before and left the house after living there for eight years. Mrs Pengelley is vague as to the cause of the row but states that she has been told by a Mr Radnor to leave Freda to come to her senses. Radnor is described as \\"just a friend\\" and a \\"very pleasant young fellow\\". Poirot and Hastings travel to Cornwall the next day and are shocked to find that Mrs Pengelley died half an hour before. Poirot interviews the dead woman's doctor, who at first denies that anything could be wrong but is then astounded to learn she had gone to London to consult the detective. Their last visit before leaving Cornwall is to Mrs Pengelley's niece. They meet Freda Stanton and Jacob Radnor and discover that the couple is engaged, and that the cause of the row between Freda and her aunt was the older woman's own infatuation with Radnor, a far younger man. The situation became so bad that Freda had no option but to move out. Poirot and Hastings return to London but are able to follow events in the papers as rumour spreads leading to Mrs Pengelley's body being exhumed and traces of arsenic found. Her widower is arrested and charged with murder. Attending the committal hearing, Poirot invites Radnor back to his flat where he produces a written confession for the man to sign. He planned to get rid of both the Pengelleys, one through murder and the other by execution so his new wife, Freda, would inherit their money. Mrs Pengelley fell for Radnor because he made sure she would, flirting with her while at the same time planting seeds in the woman's mind that her husband was trying to poison her. Poirot offers him twenty-four hours escape if he signs the confession before he hands it over to the police and dupes the man into thinking that Poirot's own flat is being watched. Radnor signs and hurries out. Poirot confesses to Hastings that he did not have any real evidence of Radnor's guilt and that the stunt was his only option to get Mr Pengelley acquitted. He is sure that Scotland Yard will catch up with Radnor, despite the latter's twenty-four hours head start. =The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly= Poirot is called in to investigate the kidnapping of three-year-old Johnnie Waverly, the son of Marcus Waverly, from his home, Waverly Court in Surrey. Prior to the kidnapping, the family received anonymous letters that threatened to take the boy unless twenty-five thousand pounds was paid. The police took little interest until the final letter which stated that the boy would be kidnapped at twelve o'clock the next day. On that day, Mrs. Waverly was mildly poisoned and a note was left on Mr. Waverly's pillow that stated, \\"At Twelve O'clock\\". Horrified that someone inside the house is involved, Mr. Waverly sacks all of the staff except Tredwell, his long-time butler, and Miss Collins, his wife's trusted secretary-companion. At the appointed time Waverly, his son and Inspector McNeil of Scotland Yard are in a locked room in the house with police posted in the extensive grounds. Precisely at noon the police find a tramp sneaking toward the house. He has cotton wool, chloroform and a post-kidnap note ready to plant. When Waverly and the Inspector dash outside to see what is happening, the boy is taken by car through a now unguarded gate. They hear the village clock chiming twelve and realise that the main clock in the house had been set forward ten minutes. The tramp claims Tredwell employed him but the butler has an alibi for the time that he was said to meet the tramp: he was in the house with Mr. Waverly. Poirot travels to Waverly Court and is told of the existence of a priest hole. In it he finds the footprint of a small dog in one corner but no one knew of any such creature small enough in the house. After questioning the child's sacked nurse, Tredwell and Miss Collins, Poirot concludes his investigation. Poirot confronts Mr. Waverly. Poirot says that Waverly kidnapped his own son to get money from his rich but very parsimonious wife. The poisoning of the wife to incapacitate her, the note on the pillow and the re-setting of the clock all point to an inside job, and only Mr. Waverly could sack all of the servants to reduce the level of protection around the child. Tredwell was in on the plan and he did indeed employ the tramp. The footprint of the dog in the priest's hole was from a toy kept there to amuse the boy until he could be spirited away afterwards. A shamefaced Mr. Waverly confesses to Poirot and reveals that the child was presently with his former nurse. =The Double Clue= Poirot is called in by Marcus Hardman, a collector of various antique precious objects, to investigate a jewel robbery. The theft occurred from his safe when he was holding a small tea party at his house. He showed his guests his collection of medieval jewels and later discovered that the safe had been rifled and the objects taken. Four of his guests had the opportunity to take the items ‚Äì Mr Johnston, a South African millionaire only just arrived in London; Countess Vera Rossakoff, a refugee from the Russian revolution; Bernard Parker, a young and effeminate agent for Mr Hardman, and Lady Runcorn, a middle-aged society lady whose aunt is a kleptomaniac. Poirot examines the scene of the crime and finds a man's glove holding the safe open and a cigarette case with the initials \\"BP\\". He visits Bernard Parker who states that the glove is his ‚Äì but vehemently denies owning the cigarette case. Nevertheless, Poirot finds the twin of the glove in the hallway of Parker's house. Later that day, Poirot receives a visit from the Countess Rossakoff who is indignant that Poirot is pursuing Parker. Previously suspicious that the Countess may not be a real Russian, Poirot admits that the impressive lady is who she says she is. That evening, Hastings sees Poirot studying a book on Russian grammar. The next day he visits Hardman and tells him who the thief is. The collector is astonished and leaves Poirot to pursue the matter without police involvement. Poirot and Hastings visit the Countess and Poirot calmly tells the lady that his taxi is waiting and that he would be obliged if she would give him the jewels. She, equally calmly, does so. They part on good terms, the Countess admitting that Poirot is one of the few men she fears. He in turn is very impressed by her. He tells Hastings that it was the double clue of the glove and the case which made him suspicious. Only one of the clues was genuine and the other a mistake. As the cigarette case was not Parker's, that must have been the genuine clue. The case belonged to the Countess whose initials ‚Äì VR ‚Äì are –í–† in Cyrillic, hence Poirot's perusal of the book on Russian grammar. =The King of Clubs= The Oglander family was playing bridge in the drawing room of their house in Streatham last night when the French windows burst open and a woman staggered in, blood on her dress. She managed to say, \\"Murder!\\" and then collapsed. The family fetched both a doctor and the police who called at the next-door villa to find the body of Henry Reedburn, the theatrical impresario, dead in the library with his skull split open by some unknown weapon. The woman is identified as the famous dancer, Valerie Saintclair. Poirot receives a visit from Prince Paul of Maurania, who wants to marry the dancer. Reedburn was in love with Valerie although his feelings were not reciprocated. Prince Paul and Valerie saw a clairvoyant the previous week who turned over the king of clubs in her pack of cards and said a man threatened danger to her. The prince is afraid that Valerie interpreted this to mean Reedburn, and attacked him. Poirot and Hastings visit the scene of the crime. The library runs the length of one side of the house. At either end are curtained recesses with French windows, one to the garden and the other to the drive. It was in the recess facing the garden that Reedburn was found. The dead man had a female visitor that night that he let into the house himself but the servants did not see her. Poirot sees a marble seat in the recess whose arm-ends are carved in the form of lions' heads and wonders if they could have caused the wound to Reedburn's head. The doctor says there is no blood on the marble. They proceed to the Oglander home, along the garden path. In the drawing room, the table with the cards for the interrupted bridge game is still in place. Miss Saintclair is still in the house, ill in bed. She tells them that Reedburn held a secret of hers and threatened her but she did not kill him. She went to his house by prior appointment and was pleading with him when a man dressed like a tramp attacked him from behind the curtained recess. She fled from the house towards the lights of the Oglander house. Returning to the drawing room Poirot notices that the king of clubs is missing from the cards on the bridge table. They return to Reedburn's house and in the curtained recess that leads to the drive they find a twin of the marble seat, again with lion's head arms but this one has a faint bloodstain on it. Reedburn was killed here and his body dragged to the recess facing the garden. Poirot has the missing king of clubs, having taken it from the card box before at the Oglander house. He returns there to assure Mrs. Oglander that the police will not find out what happened. He returns the playing card to her, telling her it was their only slip-up. He tells Hastings what happened. The bridge game was set up after the event as an alibi for the four members of the family. By mistake one card was left in the box. The son of the family killed Reedburn when he went with Valerie to plead with the blackmailer, presumably when things escalated into violence. Valerie is the estranged daughter of the Oglander family. Despite the breach in the relationship, she turned to them in her moment of need. Her story of the tramp will stand and she is free to marry Prince Paul. This is one of the few cases (aside from Murder on the Orient Express) in which Poirot allows a guilty party to avoid punishment, particularly when there is a dead body involved. =The Lemesurier Inheritance= In the latter days of the First World War, Poirot and Hastings dine at the Carlton where they meet Captain Vincent Lemesurier and his uncle Hugo, a chemist. Cousin Roger rushes in with the news that Vincent's father has had a serious fall from a horse and is not expected to last the night. Vincent and Uncle Hugo leave. Vincent, the eldest and only of three sons to survive the war, was not close with his father. Roger tells them that Vincent's strong reaction to the bad news is partly due to the Lemesurier curse. No first born son has lived to inherit the family estate since the Middle Ages. This family curse arose from an ancestor who erroneously suspected his wife of being unfaithful and his young son of not being his own. In a fit of rage he killed them both. His wife cursed him before she died that no first-born son of his descendants should ever inherit. Instead it passed to nephews, younger brothers or younger sons. The next day, Poirot and Hastings learn that Vincent died, after he jumped from the moving train on the way home. His death is put down to a mental breakdown, from the bad news and shell-shock. Over the next few years all of the inheritors of the estate die, under causes as varied as gun accident and insect sting, leaving Hugo, youngest of five brothers, to inherit the family estate. Poirot receives a visit from Hugo's young wife. She is an American who does not believe in the curse. She worries about the elder of her two young sons, Ronald, who is eight. He has had three narrow escapes from death in the past few months. One was a fall when the boy was climbing down the ivy on the wall of their home. She saw for herself that the stem had been cut. In the house are the family, the children's governess, Hugo's secretary, John Gardiner, and frequent visitor, cousin Major Roger Lemesurier, a favorite with the boys. Poirot and Hastings travel to the home in Northumberland and renew their acquaintance with Hugo. He believes his first born son is doomed by the curse, while his second son will inherit. Hugo will die soon as he has an incurable disease, which news he shares with Poirot and Hastings. Young Ronald is stung by a bee, by his father's report, and Poirot is immediately concerned. He and Hastings keep vigil all night in Ronald's room. A figure creeps into the darkened bedroom and is about to poison the young boy by injection when Poirot and Hastings overpower him. It is Hugo, the boy's father. He is responsible for the deaths until he gained the estate, and is now a madman. Hugo is placed in an asylum, where he dies. Mrs Lemesurier later marries John Gardiner, and the curse, if it existed, is broken. =The Lost Mine= Poirot informs Hastings that he has no risky investments except for fourteen thousand shares in Burma Mines Ltd, which were given to him for services rendered. He relates the story to Hastings. The lead-silver mines were originally worked only for the silver by the Chinese in the fifteenth century. The lead remained, of value now. The mine's location was lost; the only clue to its location is in old papers in the hands of a Chinese family. Wu Ling agreed to negotiate a sale of the papers and travelled to England to complete the transaction. Mr. Pearson was to meet Wu Ling at the train in Southampton but the train was delayed, so Pearson left. He thought Wu Ling made his own way to London where he booked into the Hotel Russell Square and telephoned the company to say that he would see them the next day. He failed to appear at the meeting and the hotel was contacted. They said Wu Ling had gone out earlier with a friend. He still failed to appear at the offices throughout the day. The police were contacted and the next evening Wu Ling's body was found floating in the Thames. Poirot investigates people who shared the voyage to England with Wu Ling. He finds that one of them, a young bank clerk called Charles Lester, was the man who called for Wu Ling at his hotel on the morning of the disappearance. Mr Lester told a story of having been asked by Wu Ling to call for him at 10:30 am. Instead his servant appeared and asked him to accompany him to meet Wu Ling. Their taxi took them to Limehouse where Lester started to get nervous and got out of the taxi before they reached their destination and that was the end of his connection with the affair. However, Wu Ling had no servant. The taxi driver who took both men to a known opium den said Lester alone emerged looking ill half an hour later. Lester is arrested but the papers about the mine are not found. Pearson and Poirot go to Limehouse and investigate the opium den. They overhear a conversation between some of the Chinese about the death of Wu Ling and that Lester certainly had the papers. Poirot and Pearson leave the den quietly. Poirot quickly finds the papers ‚Äì Pearson has them. He had indeed met Wu Ling in Southampton (there was only his own word that he failed to meet the visitor) and taken him direct to Limehouse where Wu Ling was killed. One of the opium dealers had already been put into the Hotel Russell Square to impersonate Wu Ling. Hearing of Lester's invitation to visit the hotel from Wu Ling himself, Pearson set the young man up to take the blame for the murder. Lester entered the opium den and was drugged. Having only a hazy recollection and losing his nerve, he denied entering the den. Pearson's insistence in taking Poirot to Limehouse was an elaborate charade to divert the detective's suspicions but it had the opposite effect. Pearson is arrested and Poirot becomes a shareholder in a Burmese mine. =The Plymouth Express= A young naval officer on the Plymouth express finds the dead body of a woman underneath a seat in his carriage. The woman is identified as the Honourable Mrs Rupert Carrington, n√©e Flossie Halliday, the daughter of Ebenezer Halliday, an American steel magnate who asks Poirot to take on the case. Prior to her marriage she was caught up with an adventurer called Count de la Rochefour but her father took her back to America. She later married Rupert Carrington who proved an unsuitable husband, being a gambler deep in debt. They were about to announce a legal separation. Her will leaves everything to her estranged husband who was away from town at the time of the tragedy. Poirot and Hastings call on Mr Halliday in Park Lane. Last seen, his daughter was going to a house party in the West Country, carrying her jewels to wear at the house party. The jewels are valued at almost one hundred thousand pounds. She travelled by train from Paddington and changed at Bristol for the train to Plymouth. Her maid travelled with her in a third-class carriage. At Bristol the maid, Jane Mason, received a surprise: Mrs Carrington told her to wait at the station for a few hours. She would return for a later Plymouth train. When she was being given these instructions, Mason could see the back of a tall man in Mrs Carrington's compartment. After waiting at Bristol for most of the day, Mason checked into a hotel for the night and read of the murder in the next day's paper. Mrs Carrington had been chloroformed and then stabbed and the jewels were missing. Mason comes to confirm the facts of her part of the story. She describes what Mrs Carrington was wearing at the time. Poirot pushes Halliday to tell him what he is holding back. Halliday produces a note found in his daughter's pocket from the Count de la Rochefour. It appears that their romance has been restarted. Inspector Japp makes enquiries into the whereabouts of Rupert Carrington and the Count de la Rochefour at the time of the murder, but nothing substantial comes to light. When Japp next visits, Poirot guesses that the knife used to kill Mrs Carrington has been found by the side of the line between Weston (the first stop after Bristol on the Plymouth line) and Taunton (the next stop) and that a paper boy who spoke to Mrs Carrington has been interviewed. Japp confirms that this is exactly what has happened. Japp tells Poirot something he does not know ‚Äì that one of the jewels has been pawned by a known thief called Red Narky, a short man who usually works with a woman called Gracie Kidd. Poirot and Hastings return to Halliday's house, to a room on the top floor. Rummaging through Mason's trunk, Poirot finds clothes like the ones worn by Mrs Carrington when she was murdered. Halliday joins them followed by the angry Mason, whom Poirot introduces as Gracie Kidd. She and Red Narky probably murdered Mrs Carrington before Bristol. The story about Mrs Carrington directing her maid to wait at Bristol is false. The knife was thrown off the train before Taunton to support that story. Gracie rode the train past Bristol dressed in similar clothing to the now-dead woman and bought two items from a newsboy, drawing attention to herself in many ways. Gracie Kidd provided herself with an alibi by making the murder by Red Narky appear to have taken place later than it did. This short story was expanded five years later into the full-length novel The Mystery of the Blue Train, with a very similar plot, but names and details changed. =The Chocolate Box= Hastings mentions his belief that Poirot had never known failure in his professional career. Poirot said that was not true and relates the one occasion when he failed to solve a crime, years earlier when he was a police detective in Brussels. Paul D√©roulard, a French Deputy who was living in Brussels, had died from heart failure. At a time of strife over the separation of church and state M. D√©roulard was a key player as an anti- Catholic and a potential minister. He lived in a Brussels home that his late wife left him. He had a reputation as a ladies' man. Mademoiselle Virginie Mesnard, a cousin of his late wife, asks Poirot to investigate. She is convinced that his death three days earlier was not natural. M. D√©roulard's household consists of four servants, his aged and infirm aristocratic mother, herself, and on that night, two visitors: M. de Saint Alard, a neighbour from France, and John Wilson, an English friend. Virginie introduces Poirot into the household and he begins interviewing the servants about the meal served on the night of M. D√©roulard's death. He suspects poison, but all ate from common serving dishes. In the study where the death occurred, Poirot spots an open but full and untouched box of chocolates. M. D√©roulard ate some chocolates every night after dinner, finishing a box on the night of his death. The servant retrieves the empty box. Poirot notices that the lids of the two boxes, one blue and one pink, are switched. As only D√©roulard ate the chocolates, the new box should not have been opened yet. His doctor says Saint Alard and D√©roulard had argued strenuously that evening, justifying the cause of death. Poirot finds the local chemist who made eye drops for the aged Madame D√©roulard, for her cataracts. He finds the \\"English chemist\\" who had made up the prescription of trinitrin for John Wilson, small tablets in chocolate to lower blood pressure. Too many tablets at once would prove fatal. This development bothers Poirot. Wilson had the opportunity but not the motive whereas the position is reversed for M. de Saint Alard. Virginie gives Poirot the address of Saint Alard in the Ardennes. In the disguise of a plumber, Poirot breaks into the house and discovers an empty pill bottle from Wilson in the bathroom cupboard. Poirot thinks he has solved the case. In Brussels, Madame D√©roulard summons Poirot. Learning that Poirot was a police officer who had concluded his investigations, she confesses to the murder of her son. Some years before, she saw him push his wife down the stairs and realised ‚ÄúHe was an evil man.‚Äù Afraid of the persecution that her son‚Äôs new role would bring upon the church and for his approaches to the innocent Virginie, she resolved to kill her son. She stole John Wilson's tablets. She opened the new box of chocolates before seeing that the previous box was not yet empty. After inserting about 20 tiny tablets in one chocolate, she took the opportunity to place the empty bottle into M. de Saint Alard's pocket when he came to say his farewell, thinking that his valet would throw it away. Poirot told her that he had completed his investigation and the matter was closed. Madame D√©roulard died a week later of her infirmities. Poirot considers his mistakes. The mother‚Äôs poor eyesight would cause her, and only her, to swap the lids. He misread the psychology of a murderer - Saint Alard would never have kept the empty bottle had he been guilty. Poirot told Hastings to remind him with the phrase chocolate box, if he seemed conceited. Then, he unconsciously goes on to boast about his successes. Hastings hesitates, considers, then graciously refrains from comment. =The Submarine Plans= Poirot is urgently summoned late at night by special messenger to 'Sharples', the home of Lord Alloway, head of the Ministry of Defence and a potential future Prime Minister. Arriving with Hastings, he is introduced by their host to Admiral Sir Harry Weardale, the First Sea Lord who is a guest at Sharples together with his wife and son, Leonard. The secret plans for the new 'Z'-type of submarine were stolen some three hours earlier. The facts of the case are that the ladies of the party ‚Äì Mrs Conroy and Lady Weardale ‚Äì retired to bed at 10:00 pm as did Leonard Weardale. Lord Alloway instructed his secretary, Mr Fitzroy, to move the various papers that he and the Admiral would require for their evening's work from the safe out to the table in the study, while the two men walked on the terrace and finished their cigars. Lord Alloway fancies that as they turned back on the terrace he saw a shadow move away from the open French window that leads into the study, although the Admiral is dismissive of this idea. Going into the study, they discovered the submarine plans were missing. Fitzroy claims to have been distracted by a scream outside the study. He went out to find Mrs Conroy's maid standing on the stairs, and she claimed that she had seen a ghost. It was then that the plans were probably stolen. Poirot examines the grass outside the study window and finds no trace of footprints, even though it rained earlier in the evening. That means someone in the house is responsible. He questions the household, although at Lord Alloway's insistence, he does not reveal to them that the plans have been stolen. Lord Alloway points out that Fitzroy is discounted. His secretary has access to the safe and could have copied the plans at any time. The prime suspect is Mrs Conroy, whose past life is something of a mystery, and she moves in diplomatic circles. She was specifically asked down for the weekend so that they could keep an eye on her. Questioning Conroy's foreign maid, Poirot correctly guesses that she screamed when Leonard Weardale sneaked an unexpected kiss from her. She quickly invented the ghost story when her cry attracted Fitzroy's attention. At this juncture, Lady Weardale reappears and asks Poirot if the matter could be dropped if the plans were returned. He agrees that that could be arranged and she promises that they will be within ten minutes. Poirot puts this offer to Lord Alloway, without mentioning any names, and leaves. Hastings questions this unexpected turn of events, suspecting Lady Weardale's rumoured bridge debts are real. Poirot points out that as the story of the shadow of an intruder leaving the study turned out to be incorrect, the plans must have been taken by Fitzroy or by Lord Alloway himself ‚Äì the logical conclusion. Hastings is dubious but Poirot points out that the man was rumoured to be involved in share scandals years before, although he was later exonerated. Suppose the rumours were true, and he was being blackmailed, in all probability by Mrs Conroy, a foreign agent? He would hand over fake copies of the plans with suitable adjustments to make them useless, and then pretend they had been stolen. That would be why he insisted his loyal secretary was not suspected. Leonard Weardale was busy with the maid at the time of the supposed theft and Lady Weardale could not be the thief as she needed ten minutes to get the plans back, whereas she would need a lot less time if she had taken them and hidden them. Poirot's theory also explains why Lord Alloway did not want the guests told of the theft of the plans ‚Äì he wanted the foreign power to receive the false plans. Hastings remains unconvinced. However, on the day when Lord Alloway became Prime Minister, Poirot receives a cheque and a signed photograph dedicated to \\"my discreet friend\\". He also hears that a foreign power attempted to build their own version of the submarine which ended up a failure. This short story was later expanded into the novella- length story The Incredible Theft which has a similar plot. There were changes to the character names and story details (e.g., the plans are for a new state- of-the-art bomber rather than for a new submarine). =The Third Floor Flat= Four young people, two women and two men, are returning after a night out to the home of one of the women ‚Äì Patricia Garnett. She is annoyed as she cannot find the key to her flat on the fourth floor of her apartment block in her handbag. The porter does not have a spare key, nor is there a fire escape, but the suggestion is made that the two men, Donovan Bailey and Jimmy Faulkener, make their way up through the coal lift and let the women in. They go to the basement and make their way up. Exiting the lift, they find the kitchen in darkness and Donovan instructs Jimmy to remain where he is while he locates the light switch. He does so but the light fails to work and Donovan makes his way to the sitting room where he switches on that room's light; they suddenly realise that they have miscounted the floors and that they are in the flat below which, according to a pile of letters, seems to belong to a Mrs Ernestine Grant. They make their way up to the next floor again via the coal lift and let Pat and the second lady, Mildred Hope, into the former's flat. They notice that Donovan has cut himself as there is blood on his hand. He washes it off but cannot find a cut to explain the blood and voices his fears to Jimmy. Again using the coal lift, they return to Mrs Grant's flat below and soon spot a foot sticking out from under a curtain ‚Äì it is the dead body of Mrs Grant. Back on the landing with the girls, they are discussing calling the police when a voice interrupts them, agreeing with their plan of action. It is the occupant of the fifth floor flat Hercule Poirot, the famous detective. Going into Mrs Grant's flat, Poirot finds it curious that the light switch in the kitchen now works. He also sees that the red tablecloth disguises a patch of blood, which Donovan touched to get the blood on his hand. The body was moved after death. The police arrive and Poirot and the four people return to Pat's flat. Inspector Rice questions them and tells them that Mrs Grant was shot with an automatic pistol some five hours earlier in the kitchen. They have found a note from someone signed \\"J.F.\\" saying that he would be there at half-past-seven (the approximate time of death), the pistol with which she was shot and a silk handkerchief used to wipe the prints from the gun. Poirot is suspicious ‚Äì why would the murderer wipe his prints and yet leave his own handkerchief as evidence behind? The police leave but the Inspector gives Poirot permission to inspect the flat. He goes down there with Donovan and Jimmy. Poirot searches in the kitchen bin and finds a small bottle. He sniffs the corked top carefully but says that he has a cold; Donovan impetuously pulls the stopper out and sniffs the contents for him. Donovan drops in a faint. Jimmy fetches his friend a drink and Donovan recovers and decides to go home. Jimmy remains and Poirot tells him the case is solved. There is no such person as John Fraser as the letter and handkerchief were put there to misdirect the police. The bottle in the bin was a ruse by Poirot; it contained ethyl chloride to knock Donovan briefly unconscious. While Jimmy was getting the drink for his friend, Poirot searched Donovan's pockets to find Pat's missing flat key which Donovan had abstracted earlier in the evening and a letter sent to Mrs Grant which arrived by the late evening post. Poirot thought it odd that the light switch in the kitchen did not work then did work minutes later. Donovan needed to get Jimmy out of the kitchen into the other room whilst he found the letter; the light not working was the ruse to gain him the few minutes he needed before the mistake of being in the wrong flat was obvious to Jimmy. The letter is from a firm of solicitors agreeing that the marriage between Donovan Bailey and Ernestine Grant some eight years before in Switzerland was entirely lawful. Donovan wanted to marry Pat but his previous marriage was stopping him. By chance his first wife moved into the same block as his proposed future wife and was threatening to tell Patricia about their marriage. To stop her, Donovan killed her earlier in the evening but had to return for the solicitor's letter. =Double Sin= Poirot, as a result of spreading fame, has been overworked and Hastings suggests he rests by accompanying him on a week's holiday to the south Devon coastal resort of Ebermouth. On their fourth day there, Poirot receives a note from the theatrical agent Joseph Aarons who asks him to travel to Charlock Bay on the north Devon coast as he needs to consult him on a matter. The two are planning to go by train but Hastings sees a notice for a motor bus tour from the one resort to the other which will save time on changing trains. Poirot reluctantly agrees, afraid of the uncertain English climate and the drafts of air which will invade the bus. They book their tickets at the office of the company concerned where Hastings is taken with another customer, an auburn- haired girl, whereas Poirot is intrigued by a young man who is attempting to grow a feeble moustache. The next day on the bus the two find themselves sat with the young girl who introduces herself as Mary Durrant. Her aunt is in Ebermouth and runs an antiques shop where she has managed to make something of a success for herself. Mary has started to work with her aunt as opposed to becoming a governess or a companion and she is travelling to Charlock Bay to take a valuable set of miniatures to an American collector there by the name of J. Baker Wood for perusal and purchase. The bus stops for lunch at Monkhampton and Miss Durrant joins Poirot and Hastings at a table in a caf√©. Part way through their conversation, she rushes outside and returns saying that she thought she saw through the window a man taking her suitcase with the miniatures off the bus, when she confronted him she realised his case was almost exactly like hers and that she was in error. She does however describe the young man that Poirot and Hastings saw the previous day in the booking office. The bus arrives in Charlock Bay and both Poirot and Hastings and Miss Durrant book into the Anchor Hotel. They have barely started unpacking when a white-faced Miss Durrant appears and tells them that her suitcase has been unlocked somehow, the despatch case inside containing the miniatures has been forced open and the items stolen. Having heard that Poirot is a detective, she asks him to investigate. Poirot telephones Mr Wood who tells him that he had a visit half-an-hour ago from someone calling on behalf of Elizabeth Penn, Mary Durrant's aunt, and he paid five hundred pounds for the miniatures. Poirot and Hastings go to visit Mr Wood, Poirot voicing his puzzlement over why the thief took the time to force the lock of despatch case while leaving it in the suitcase instead of taking the inner case away with them and opening it at their leisure. The two meet Mr Wood and take an instant dislike to the brash, vulgar man. He gives them a description of the seller: \\"a tall woman, middle- aged, grey hair, blotchy complexion and a budding moustache\\". Poirot finds out that the young man on the bus, Norton Kane, has an alibi for the period in question. The next day, having sorted out Joseph Aaron's problem, Poirot and Hastings return to Ebermouth but, at Poirot's insistence, this time by train. They call at Elizabeth Penn's shop and Poirot almost immediately accuses the elderly lady of being Mr Wood's visitor of the previous day in disguise and meaningfully tells the two women their scam must cease. Miss Penn, white- faced, agrees. Poirot points out to Hastings again the absurdity of the despatch case being forced but left in the suitcase; they never were in Miss Durant's case. When they were booking their tickets on the excursion, he saw Miss Durrant watching Mr Kane and wondered why she was so interested. He expected something to happen on the trip and it did. Mr Wood would have had to return the miniatures as they were officially stolen goods and the two women would have had his five hundred pounds and still possessed the miniatures to sell on again. Their plan was to pass suspicion on to Mr Kane and have Poirot and Hastings as two duped witnesses. =The Market Basing Mystery= At Japp‚Äôs suggestion Poirot and Hastings joined him for the weekend in the small countryside town of Market Basing. Enjoying Sunday breakfast, the three are interrupted when the local constable requested Japp's help. Walter Protheroe, the reclusive owner of a local large mansion, was found dead in his dilapidated house, supposedly by suicide. The three go to Leigh House as requested and meet Dr. Giles who was called in by Miss Clegg, the housekeeper. She was unable to raise her master, Walter Protheroe, in his bedroom, nor could Giles. Constable Pollard arrived at that moment and he and the doctor broke down the oak door. Inside they found Protheroe, shot through the head and his pistol clasped in his right hand. The problem was that the bullet entered behind the left ear and such a shot was impossible. As they examine the room Hastings puzzled as to why Poirot sniffed the air so keenly and also why he examined so carefully a handkerchief lodged up Protheroe's right sleeve. Hastings could smell nothing in the air, nor could he see anything on the handkerchief. The key is missing from the lock of the door and Japp supposes that this was the murderer's error in trying to make the murder look like suicide. A couple named Parker were staying in the house. Miss Clegg says their unexpected first visit did not seem to please Protheroe. He kept a pistol, although she has not seen it for some time. She cannot say why the windows of the room were locked and bolted contrary to custom. Mr. Parker lies about owning a cufflink found at the crime scene. At the inquest a tramp comes forward to say that he heard Protheroe and Parker argue about money at midnight on the night of the death. Protheroe's true surname was Wendover; he had been involved with the treacherous sinking of a naval vessel some years earlier and Parker was blackmailing him over this. On the suspicion of killing Wendover and making it look like suicide, Parker is arrested. Poirot summons Miss Clegg to the inn. He surmises that Wendover did in fact kill himself, with his left hand holding the gun. Clegg admits that when she found him in the morning, she judged Parker to be the cause, so she changed the pistol to his right hand to throw suspicion on the blackmailer to bring him to justice; however, she neglected to change the handkerchief up the right sleeve over to the left sleeve as well. She locked and bolted the windows to prevent it looking like a potential murderer escaped by that method, therefore indicating that the murderer was someone in the house. The fireplace grate was full of smoked cigarettes, yet the air was fresh. Poirot deduced that the windows of the room must have been open that night, otherwise the air would have smelled smoky and the tramp could not have overheard the conversation he did. =Wasps' Nest= Sitting on the garden terrace of his large house on a summer evening, John Harrison is delighted to receive an unexpected visit from Hercule Poirot. The detective tells him that he is in the locality to investigate a murder but amazes Harrison by admitting that the murder has not yet been committed but that it is better to prevent one happening first. He then cryptically turns the conversation round to a wasps' nest on a tree that he sees nearby and Poirot and Harrison discuss the destruction of it. A friend of Harrison, Claude Langton, is going to handle the task for him using petrol injected by a garden syringe but Poirot tells him that earlier that day he saw the poison book in a local chemist's and an earlier entry made by Langton for the purchase of cyanide, despite Langton having told Harrison that such substances should not ever be available for pest control. Poirot asks a quiet question: \\"Do you like Langton?\\" and they talk of Harrison's engagement to a girl called Molly Deane who was previously engaged to Langton. As they discuss Langton's disposition towards Harrison, Poirot's meaning becomes quite clear to the other man ‚Äì he is being warned. Poirot asks when Langton is returning and is told nine o'clock that evening. Poirot tells him that he will return at that time, wondering as he goes if he should have waited behind. Poirot returns just before the appointed time to find Langton leaving, the nest still intact. Harrison seems to be fine and Poirot hopes that he is not feeling any ill-effects of having digested the harmless washing soda that he consumed. Harrison is surprised. Poirot tells him that he traded the cyanide Harrison had in his pocket for the soda when he visited earlier on. Poirot met Langton after leaving the chemist's and heard from him that Harrison had insisted on the use of cyanide over petrol. Poirot witnessed the early signs of Langton's romance with Molly Deane being rekindled and Harrison leaving a Harley Street consultant having obviously been given bad news. Harrison confirms that he has two months to live. Having seen signs of Harrison's hatred for Langton, Poirot surmised that Harrison was planning to commit suicide and make it appear that Langton had killed him, ensuring that his rival would be hanged for murder. Poirot's earlier conversation included several traps, including the time of Langton's appointment. Poirot already knew Langton was due to return at eight- thirty but Harrison said it was nine, by which time he hoped to have committed the deed. Having realised and repented of what he would have done, Harrison expresses his gratitude for Poirot having visited and spoiled his plans. =The Veiled Lady= Poirot tells Hastings that the criminals of England fear him too much, so he has no cases. Hastings describes a recent theft from a jeweller's shop window in Bond Street. The perpetrator was arrested on the spot. However, they found paste copies of the six stolen stones on him. He had already passed the real jewels to an accomplice. A heavily veiled lady arrives. She identifies herself as Lady Millicent Castle Vaughan, whose engagement to the Duke of Southshire was recently announced. At age sixteen she wrote an indiscreet letter to a soldier. The letter would surely anger her fianc√©, and it is now in the possession of Mr. Lavington. He is demanding twenty thousand pounds for its return, a sum she cannot afford. She went to Lavington's house in Wimbledon to plead with him. He showed her the letter in a Chinese puzzle box and says he keeps in a place she will never find. Lavington calls on Poirot, but laughs at his request to return the letter. He leaves for Paris, giving Lady Millicent several days to pay up. Poirot goes to Lavington's house the next day. He calls in the morning, dressed as a man hired to affix burglarproof locks on the window. He saws through the sash latch of a window and breaks in that night with Hastings. After a long search, Poirot finds the box hidden in a hollowed log, at the bottom of a small wood pile in the kitchen. The next day, Lady Millicent calls for the letter. She also insists on the puzzle box as a souvenir but Poirot prevents her taking it. Then, he reveals a hidden compartment in the box holding the six missing jewels from the Bond Street robbery. The fake letter was a red herring for anyone who found the puzzle box. Japp appears from another room and identifies the lady as \\"Gertie\\", an accomplice of Lavington, whose real name was Reed. Reed was killed in Holland a few days before for his double-cross of his gang over the jewels. The gang members decided to use Poirot to retrieve the missing jewels. Poirot tells Hastings that it was the cheap shoes she was wearing that made him suspect that she was not who she claimed to be. Poirot concludes that not only is he known to the criminals of England, they try to use him when their own efforts fail. =Problem at Sea= Poirot is undergoing the trial of a sea voyage to Egypt, supposedly as a holiday. Not enjoying one bit the motion of the waves, he joins in the conversations of the other passengers. Among them is a General Forbes who is angrily dismissive of a man who calls himself Colonel Clapperton. He states that Clapperton is a former music hall performer who, injured during the war, got himself into a society lady's nursing home and then received her patronage to find him a job at the War Office. The other passengers on the boat are more sympathetic towards Clapperton, particularly as he demonstrates continuing patience with his shrewish and hypochondriac wife, who complains of her heart trouble while at the same time stating that she keeps extremely active, despite her husband's constant entreaties to take life easier. Even Poirot seems to incur her wrath when he responds a little too dryly to her conversation. Somewhat annoyed with him, she marches out of the smoking room where they have been conversing, dropping the contents of her handbag on the way. She leaves behind a piece of paper ‚Äì a prescription for digitalin. Two young girls on the boat, Kitty Mooney and Pamela Creegan, take a shine to the Colonel and decide to \\"rescue\\" him from his wife. They take him for a walk on the boat deck while his wife plays bridge, a game which the Colonel will not play. Later on, Poirot sees the Colonel demonstrating amazing card tricks to the two young girls who have taken him under their wing. Able to deal out hands of exact suits to the others, the Colonel makes them realise why he will not play cards ‚Äì he would be able to cheat and win every time ‚Äì or at least be suspected of doing so ‚Äì and it would be better for him not to take part. The boat reaches Alexandria and many of the company go ashore. Mrs Clapperton refuses, shouting to her husband from behind her locked cabin door that she has suffered a bad night and wants to be left alone. When everyone has returned later on, Mrs Clapperton is still not answering her door. A steward opens it for her worried husband and they find the lady dead ‚Äì stabbed through the heart with a native dagger and money and jewellery stolen. Several bead sellers were allowed on the boat at the port and they are questioned, particularly as one of their wares was found on the floor of the cabin. Poirot though is puzzled: the door to the cabin was locked from within and he cannot see a reason why Mrs Clapperton would open it to a bead seller, nor why such a person would murder her and lay himself so open to suspicion. That evening, at Poirot's request, the other passengers are assembled in the lounge. Poirot addresses them and unwraps a ventriloquist's doll which speaks and repeats the words used by Mrs Clapperton from behind the locked cabin door to her husband. Colonel Clapperton jumps up and promptly collapses, dead of a heart attack. Poirot explains: Mrs Clapperton was already dead when her husband, witnessed by Poirot, Kitty and Pamela, heard her \\"speak\\" to him from inside the cabin but it was her husband using his music hall act. He showed his card trick to the others to divert attention away from his real skill. Poirot's use of the doll in the lounge was helped by a young girl (a fellow passenger and the owner of the doll) behind a curtain providing the voice. Poirot is not surprised that Clapperton died of a weak heart ‚Äì digitalin would have produced symptoms of dilated pupils which he did not see in Mrs Clapperton but he did see in her husband; the prescription was for him. =How Does Your Garden Grow?= Poirot receives a strange letter for assistance from an elderly woman, Miss Amelia Barrowby, who lives at Rosebank in Charman's Green. She is extremely vague in defining the problem, but adds several times that discretion is paramount as family is involved. The letter intrigues Poirot who has his secretary Miss Lemon draft a reply saying that he is at the lady's service. Five days later Miss Lemon spots an announcement in the \\"personal column\\" of The Morning Post about the death of Miss Barrowby. Poirot sends a letter to Rosebank to provoke a response from the next of kin, and he duly receives a reply from Mary Delafontaine, the dead woman's niece, saying that his services are no longer required. Nevertheless, he goes to the house and admires the well-maintained garden with its spring flowers and edging of shells. Let into the house by a maid, the first person he meets is a young Russian girl called Katrina Reiger, who speaks cryptically of the money that by rights is hers. She is interrupted by Mrs Delafontaine and her husband who dismiss Katrina and meet Poirot. They seem shocked to find that he is a detective. Poirot interviews the local police inspector who tells him that they now know that Miss Barrowby died from a dose of strychnine but the problem is that the victim and her two family members all ate the same meal. The Delafontaines are suspected as they will inherit a large sum of money, which they very much need, but it was Katrina who gave her employer her medicinal powders and it is possible the strychnine was in those. However, Katrina does not appear to benefit from Miss Barrowby's death, and would, in fact, have been out of a job. The next day, however, brings the news that most of the estate has been left to Katrina, thereby providing a motive, and she is detained by the police. A packet of strychnine powders is found under Katrina's mattress which seems to clinch the matter. Poirot though is not convinced and arranges matters in a methodical order in his own mind. It is then he remembers the garden. He sends out Miss Lemon to make particular enquiries and then interviews Katrina who confirms that she ate separately from the family, as she always did, but had the same food as them. Poirot, after consulting with Miss Lemon, calls at Rosebank and sees Mrs Delafontaine. At the front door, he points to the unfinished row of shells ‚Äì the only unsymmetrical item in that well-maintained and symmetrical garden ‚Äì and points out they are oyster shells. Miss Lemon found the fishmonger who sold the oysters to the Delafontaines. They fed Miss Barrowby poisoned oysters and planted the shells in the garden to hide from Katrina and the maid. Mrs Delafontaine confesses that she and her husband had been pilfering money from her aunt for many years and could not let the money go to Katrina. Literary significance and reception Maurice Richardson in The Observer (22 September 1974) described Hastings as, \\"so dumb at times he makes Watson look like Leibnitz\\", and concluded, \\"Many date from an early period before she found herself as a Mystifier, but all communicate that unique Christie euphoria.\\"The Observer, 22 September 1974 (p. 39) Robert Barnard: \\"A late collection of early stories (most from the 'twenties), which had been published in the States but not in Britain. This may suggest discarded chips from the workshop, but in fact the standard here is distinctly higher than the stories in Poirot Investigates, which were the ones Christie did publish at the time.\\"Barnard, Robert.

Fontana Books, 1990; References or Allusions =References to other works= * The Submarine Plans mentions the events recounted in the 1923 short story The Kidnapped Prime Minister and also references the fictional Prime Minister of that story, David McAdam. * Double Sin references the theatrical agent Joseph Aarons who had previously appeared in The Murder on the Links (1923). * In The Market Basing Mystery, Hastings slightly misquotes the anonymous piece of Doggerel verse which in full reads: :The rabbit has a charming face: :Its private life is a disgrace. :I really dare not name to you :The awful things that rabbits do; :Things that your paper never prints ‚Äì :You only mention them in hints. :They have such lost, degraded souls :No wonder they inhabit holes; :When such depravity is found :It only can live underground. =References to actual history, geography and current science= * The events depicted in The Chocolate Box occurred in 1893, when the debate over the separation of church and state in France was a hot issue. In The Chocolate Box story the exact date is not mentioned, but in the novel Peril at End House, chapter 15, Poirot says that the events took place in 1893. The events of the separation of church and state were wholly confined to the French state; the murdered man was in the French government but lived in an inherited house in Brussels. In the TV adaptation the Paul D√©roulard murder takes place just prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. * In Double Sin, Mary Durrant speaks of the miniatures she is transporting as being by Cosway. This is a reference to Richard Cosway (1742‚Äì1821), one of the most successful practitioners of that art of the Georgian era. =References in other works= * The Double Clue, first published in 1923, features the first of three appearances of the character of Countess Vera Rossakoff. Her other two appearances were in the series of stories in The Sketch magazine in early 1924 that eventually made up the contents of The Big Four (1927) and in The Capture of Cerberus, the final story of The Labours of Hercules (1947). Poirot's admiration of the lady mirrors that of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes for Irene Adler as described in A Scandal in Bohemia (1891). It also similar to the one it precedes in DC Comics Batman and Catwoman. * The Double Clue also features the use of the Cyrillic alphabet as a deception, a trick that Christie would reuse in Murder on the Orient Express (1934). * The plot set-up contained in The Market Basing Mystery of a suicide being made to look like murder to trap a blackmailer was expanded by Christie into the novella-length story Murder in the Mews published in the collection of the same name in 1937. It also bears resemblance to Conan Doyle's The Problem of Thor Bridge, solved by Sherlock Holmes. * The plot set-up contained in How Does Your Garden Grow? of a vague letter for assistance from a woman who soon dies was expanded by Christie into the full-length 1937 novel Dumb Witness. * The Chocolate Box case is mentioned in the novel Peril at End House (1932) in chapter 15, when Poirot tells Commander Challenger that he indeed had failures in the past. * The Submarine Plans published in 1923 has the same plot as \\"The Incredible Theft\\" published in 1937 * The protagonist in Margaret Atwood's \\"Giving Birth\\" reads Poirot's Early Cases while in labour. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations =Early television play= Wasp's Nest was the very first Agatha Christie story to be adapted for television with a live transmission taking place on 18 June 1937. Agatha Christie adapted it, and transmission was restricted to a small area in and around London. =Television= All the stories in the collection have been adapted for episodes in the ITV series Agatha Christie's Poirot with David Suchet in the role of Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Hastings, Philip Jackson as Japp and Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon. Fifteen stories were directly adapted, while one story was merged into another episode, and two stories were reworked by the author, with new titles, which were then adapted for television in the series. Fifteen adaptations (in order of transmission) were: Series One *The Adventure of the Clapham Cook: 8 January 1989 *The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly: 22 January 1989 *The Third Floor Flat: 5 February 1989 *Problem at Sea: 19 February 1989 *The King of Clubs: 5 March 1989 Series Two *The Veiled Lady: 14 January 1990 *The Lost Mine: 21 January 1990 *The Cornish Mystery: 28 January 1990 *Double Sin: 11 February 1990 Series Three *How Does Your Garden Grow?: 6 January 1991 *The Affair at the Victory Ball: 20 January 1991 *Wasp's Nest: 27 January 1991 *The Double Clue: 10 February 1991 *The Plymouth Express: 3 March 1991 Series Five *The Chocolate Box: 21 February 1993 (Note: Some scenes were filmed in Brussels, Belgium.) There were small differences in the television adaptation of The Chocolate Box from the short story. Captain Hastings is not involved. Poirot and Chief Inspector Japp visit Belgium for Japp to receive the prestigious Branche d'Or (Golden Branch) Award. The case is told in flashback and Poirot admits his error in a circular fashion. Two of the stories in this collection were reworked by Agatha Christie with new titles, and adapted for television under the new titles, both in series one of Agatha Christie's Poirot. Submarine Plans was extended into The Incredible Theft, which aired 26 February 1989 as the eighth episode of series one. The Market Basing Mystery was reworked as Murder in the Mews, which first aired 15 January 1989 as the second episode in series one. Elements of the remaining story, The Lemesurier Inheritance, were worked into the plot of The Labours of Hercules, which first aired 6 November 2013 in the UK.

Blackburn Aircraft undertook an independent design study based on a patent filed by their chief designer, John Douglas Rennie for a retractable pontoon float that formed the planing hull. Design and development The B-20 was an attempt to combine the best features of both the flying boat and the floatplane. While on the water, the B-20 was essentially a floatplane, using a large float under the fuselage for buoyancy, and two smaller floats near the wingtips for stability. In flight, the main float retracted upwards towards the fuselage, fitting into a \\"notch\\" to become streamlined as a part of the fuselage. The wing floats folded outwards, somewhat like those on the American Consolidated PBY flying boat design, to become the wingtips. This configuration gave the correct wing incidence for takeoff and for flight and in the latter a much reduced drag compared to the deep hulls of flying boats.Buttler Blackburn, along with Supermarine, Shorts and Saunders-Roe tendered designs against Air Ministry Specification R1/36. The Supermarine was chosen initially but Supermarine could not start work soon enough (due to their work on the Spitfire) and what would enter service as the Saunders Roe Lerwick became the chosen aircraft. However, the Ministry was interested enough to authorise and contract for the construction of a prototype of the B-20, serial number V8914, to test the concept. Testing The prototype, built at Dumbarton, flew for the first time on 26 March 1940. On 7 April, during a test run, the aircraft experienced extreme vibration due to aileron flutter and the crew bailed out. Three were lost, the other two were picked up by , a converted merchantman. Development ceased when the first prototype crashed, as Blackburn's resources were dedicated to the war effort. The Ministry felt the concept had been proven and the crash was not due to the pontoon design. The aircraft's wreck still exists, but remains undisturbed as it is designated a War grave. In 1998, one of the engines was raised as it had been caught in a fishing boat's nets and dragged away from the wreck, into shallower water. It is currently an exhibit in the Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum. B.40 The B-40 was an improved variant of the B-20 with Bristol Centaurus engines to meet a requirement for a small general purpose flying boat and specification R.13/40 was raised for it.Meekcoms/Morgan 1994, p. 287 Two prototypes were ordered in September 1941 but the situation was reconsidered in December. Its range was insufficient improvement over the Sunderland III, performance on one engine was unacceptable, and land-based patrol aircraft were capable of covering longer ranges. Further, there was little value as an experimental design because the principle had been proven in the B.20 and for an aircraft the size of the B.40 there would not be a significant improvement in drag. With no operational requirement for the B.40, it was therefore cancelled.Buttler.

Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department was unable to effectively manage the park. Administration was transferred to the War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters, the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations. Between the years 1891 and 1913, a total of 60 structures were erected at Fort Yellowstone, of which 35 were still in existence one hundred years later. The fort was built in two major construction waves. During the first construction period from 1891 to 1897, mainly wood-framed buildings in what has been referred to as \\"cottage style\\" were built. A few of them had Colonial Revival architectural elements. A second construction wave began in 1908 and concluded in 1913. These structures were primarily built from locally quarried sandstone. Many of the structures from the later construction period are now used as administrative offices, residences for National Park Service employees, museums and visitor center. Beyond the immediate confines of the fort, cabins were constructed for use by small detachments of army personnel while on patrol throughout the park. Besides the buildings of Fort Yellowstone, the army left a legacy of policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service as part of their resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers. History Company M, 1st Cavalry rides into Mammoth, 1886 More than 40 years before the creation of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park. Camp Sheridan, circa 1900 In August 1886, Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan sent Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry to the Park, where they established Camp Sheridan, named after General Sheridan, at Mammoth Hot Springs. Camp Sheridan consisted of an arrangement of temporary facilities at the base of Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth Hot Springs travertine terraces. None of the facilities that comprised Camp Sheridan remain as they were all removed over the years. Congress appropriated funds for the establishment of a permanent fort in 1891, and the Interior Department allocated land just north of Camp Sheridan for permanent facilities. Camp Sheridan was renamed Fort Yellowstone on May 11, 1891. The army continued to use Fort Yellowstone until they turned over control of the park and the fort to the newly formed National Park Service in October 1918. Fort Yellowstone was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 31, 2003. The fort, along with concessionaire facilities that were built after the National Park Service assumed management of the park, comprise what is collectively known as the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. Facilities Bachelor Officers Quarters Fort Yellowstone was constructed between 1891 and 1913 on the eastern edge of the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, southeast of the present Mammoth Hotel, at a cost of approximately $700,000 ($16 million in 2013 dollars). By 1905, three more troops of cavalry had been added to the original Company M contingent of 50 soldiers, and during this period the fort facilities were almost continuously expanded to meet the requirements of park administration, ordinary cavalry training, and growing numbers of visitors. The initial wave of construction between 1891‚Äì97 was representative of typical army posts of the period. Like other western military posts, the earliest buildings erected at Fort Yellowstone were constructed according to quartermaster general standardized plans. In design, they were of a generally spartan appearance with a few Colonial Revival style domestic elements, described by the army as \\"cottage style\\". Sandstone blocks, Double Captain's quarters The buildings were of one to two-and-a-half stories in height, and of frame construction with drop siding and stone foundations, with evenly spaced double-hung sash windows and prominent porches. A second phase of building and upgrades started in 1908 which resulted in the prominent architecture visible at Fort Yellowstone in the 21st century. Built from locally quarried sandstone,The stone was obtained from a quarry approximately halfway between Gardiner and the Mammoth campsite. See: these buildings defined Fort Yellowstone. The most prominent of the structures built in the later period is the Horace Albright Visitor Center which was originally the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1). Each historic building in the fort and the park was assigned an official number, with the original bachelor officers' quarters being building number 1.Building numbers reflect official National Park Service numbering of buildings in Yellowstone as listed in Culpin, Managing the Matchless Wonders, Appendix A, Government-Built Buildings Constructed in Yellowstone National Park 1879‚Äì1973, 2006. Architects Reed and Stem and Robert Reamer along with the U.S. Army Office of the Chief Quartermaster, Department of Dakota participated in the design of many of the facilities. Engineer facilities and landscaping were designed by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. =Initial construction period 1891‚Äì1907= Original guardhouse The first building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the guardhouse (Bldg 9) at the southwest corner of the fort. In 1891, visitors traveled the lower Mammoth road through what is now the main residential area for park personnel. The guardhouse was the first building they encountered in the Mammoth area and there was always a sentry on duty to check visitors entering the park. The building is now a private residence. The original fort administration building (Bldg 8) was located immediately next to the guardhouse and is now also a private residence. Of the twelve buildings constructed in 1891, the most prominent are two of the four double officers' quarters (Bldgs 6 and 7) which front the old parade ground. Other buildings constructed in 1891 included a 60-man barracks, a commissary storehouse (Bldg 10), a quartermaster storehouse (Bldg 11), a granary (Bldg 12), a bakery (Bldg 24), a stable (Bldg 25) and the first two of four non-commissioned officers' (NCO) quarters (Bldgs 30 and 33). These NCO quarters became known as \\"soap- suds row' because many of the NCO wives were former army laundresses who supplemented their husbands' income by doing laundry for post personnel. Cavalry barracks built in 1899 A number of significant buildings were added to the fort from 1893 to 1899 including a 10-bed hospital, quarters for hospital personnel (Bldg 14), and a large hay shed (Bldg 20) which were constructed in areas behind officers' row in 1894. Of these structures, only the hospital quarters building remains and is now used as a private residence. The most significant building constructed in 1895 was the U.S. Commissioner's office, which included a jail and residence for the U.S. Marshal (Bldg 49). The first commissioner was Judge John W. Meldrum who served the army and National Park Service until 1935 from this building. Located well west of the rest of the fort, this was the first stone building within the fort. It was a one-and-a- half-story rock-faced sandstone dwelling with gable-on-hip roof, through-the- cornice dormers and a full-width porch. The ground floor of the house contained the jail, office, and living quarters while bedrooms were situated on the second floor. The structure is used today as a private residence. The building was funded with the passage of the Lacey Act of 1894. Sponsored by U.S. Representative John F. Lacey, the Lacey Act was \\"An Act To protect the birds and animals in Yellowstone National Park, and to punish crimes in said park, and for other purposes.\\" Construction during this period also included two double officers' quarters (Bldgs 4 and 5) which completed \\"officers' row\\" in 1893. Two NCO quarters (Bldgs 31 and 32) were added to \\"soap-suds row\\" in 1897 and the distinctive cavalry barracks (Bldg 27), which now houses administrative offices, was constructed in 1899. Engineer's office Captain Hiram M. Chittenden was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers senior engineer in Yellowstone from 1899‚Äì1906. The Corps had been responsible for road and other infrastructure construction within the park since 1883. In 1901, in cooperation with Captain John Pitcher, Acting Park Superintendent, he began a series of projects to improve the quality of life at the fort. Chittenden had a reservoir built in 1901 to provide a consistent supply of water for irrigation, human consumption and fire fighting. The engineers oversaw a project during 1901 which cleared, manured and seeded the area immediately in front of officers' row to create a grassy parade ground and seeded areas around the various buildings to reduce perennially dusty summer conditions. Fort Yellowstone transitioned from oil to electric lighting in 1902 after Chittenden completed a 100-kilowatt powerplant east of the fort. The powerplant and reservoir no longer exist, but most of the grassy areas around Fort Yellowstone that Chittenden planned remain. Fort Yellowstone Canteen, originally the Post Exchange In 1903, Captain Chittenden oversaw the design and construction of the second stone building in Yellowstone, the engineers headquarters (Bldg 39), often called the \\"Pagoda\\" because of its design. This structure is in a prominent but isolated location just north of the fort. In 1918, after the National Park Service began administration of the park, the engineer's headquarters building became the first official park headquarters. Another prominent Yellowstone landmark, the Roosevelt Arch, was constructed in 1903 under the supervision of Chittenden. A north entrance station and gate near Gardiner, Montana, was first suggested by Captains Wilber Wilder and Oscar Brown in 1899. However it was not until 1903 that Chittenden and then- Acting Superintendent Major John Pitcher were able to gain approval for the arch. The ground breaking for the arch coincided with the two-week vacation visit of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to the park. Roosevelt was the only U.S. President to visit Yellowstone during the army era. On his last day in the park, April 24, 1903, Roosevelt participated in the cornerstone laying ceremony and the arch was completed later that year. In 1904, Major John Pitcher recommended the construction of several new buildings to accommodate the growing contingent of soldiers. The only structure approved was the new post exchange located just south of the double cavalry barracks. This striking Colonial Revival styled structure was completed in 1905, replacing a much smaller post exchange that had been built in 1894. It now functions as the National Park Service canteen. =Later construction period 1908‚Äì1913= Double barracks which is the modern park headquarters The second wave of major construction started in 1908 when the largest structures in the fort were built, including the three-story double barracks (Bldg 36), which now houses the park superintendent's office and is used as the modern park headquarters. Another large building was the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1), constructed immediately to the west, fronting the parade ground. This iconic building anchors the northwest corner of the main fort area and houses the Horace Albright Visitor Center, a museum, theater and the Yellowstone Association gift shop. Officers' row was completed with the construction of a double captains' quarters (Bldg 2) and a field officers' quarters (Bldg 3) immediately south of the bachelor officers' quarters. Cavalry stables (Bldgs 34 and 38), a double stable guardhouse and blacksmith shop (Bldg 37) were built behind these residences. All these buildings are used by the National Park Service as administrative offices, maintenance facilities or residences. The Chapel constructed in 1913 was the last structure built by the army at Fort Yellowstone. The increasing size of the army contingent required a more up-to-date guardhouse than the original. Acting Superintendents Major Benson and Colonel Brett wanted the new guardhouse to be constructed of stone. The War Department could not justify the expense, so in 1911 the guardhouse was built from concrete. The last building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the chapel, located just south of the original guardhouse. Army policy did not mandate that army forts provide places of worship. However, at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher, U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator Francis E. Warren, Congress appropriated the funds for the construction of a chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913. On September 19, 1914, Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King, 1st U.S. Cavalry, were the first couple to be married in the new chapel. Reverend Pritchard, an Episcopalian missionary, traveled to the fort from Emigrant, Montana to perform the ceremony. =Remote facilities= To provide shelter for small detachments of soldiers on overnight patrols, the army constructed soldier and snowshoeAt the time, long wooden skis were called \\"snowshoes\\". cabins in remote and isolated spots and at popular tourist locations. Most of these structures no longer exist, but similar, more modern cabins are maintained by the National Park Service throughout the park. West Thumb Soldier Station in 1904 The first soldier cabins were built in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan and all of these were later removed. Cabins were also built at the Lower Geyser Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, RiversideRiverside was located along the Madison River near the West boundary and present day West Yellowstone, Montana. and at Soda Butte. As more outposts were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet (1887), Snake River (Polecat Creek), West Thumb and Riverside (1892), Mud Geyser (1895), Norris and Thumb Bay (1897), Lake (1899), Snake River (1902), Gardiner (1903), West Thumb, Syvan Pass and Soda Butte (1904), Tower (1907), Crevice Mountain (1912), Snake River (1914), and Aster Creek, Cabin Creek, Harebell, and Thorofare (1915). Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at Astringent Creek, Bartlet, Boundary Creek, Coulter Creek, Hellroaring Creek, Lewis River, Park Point, Proposition, Trappers Creek, Trout Creek and Willow Creek. While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence, four remote structures remain. They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin (Bldg 234) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations (Bldgs 111 and 231). The Norris soldier station currently houses the Museum of the National Park Ranger. Additionally, the Bechler River barn (Bldg 232) is still in existence. Historical significance of the U.S. Army in Yellowstone U.S. Army management of Yellowstone was so successful that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia, Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy. Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to the passing of the Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators. When Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry arrived in Yellowstone, Captain Moses Harris, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient, on his own authority and initiative, promulgated a set of rules that his staff enforced to protect park resources still adhered to in the 21st century: Even though Harris and his soldiers vigilantly enforced the rules, arresting many violators, there was no legal authority for prosecution or punishment. All Harris could do was expel violators from the park. F. J. Haynes) Captain Harris, and his successor, Captain Frazier Augustus Boutelle, established a network of soldier and snowshoe cabins throughout the remote portions of the park. These cabins, strategically located about apart, were used by detachments of soldiers throughout the year as they stayed watchful for wildfires, vandalism and poaching. The use of remote ranger cabins for patrolling the park is still practiced by Park Rangers. Captain Young, during his first tour as Acting Superintendent in 1897, established patrol cabin policies that are essentially still followed by Park Rangers. Young required that soldiers using a patrol cabin keep a daily log of activities, including game counts, visitor counts and weather observations. These logs were used to compile a monthly report sent to the headquarters at Fort Yellowstone. Young issued the following orders to all soldiers using the snowshoe cabins. =Wildlife policies= Of the many decisions made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized the angling potential in Yellowstone waters. In 1889 he suggested the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams in Yellowstone. This suggestion was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, a practice that continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for. In 1902, the population of bison in the park had declined to approximately 25 individual animals. Under the leadership of Captain Pitcher, the army began a program of importing plains bison from private domestic herds in Texas and Montana. Fenced enclosures were created at Mammoth and in the Lamar Valley. Areas were ploughed and planted with oats and timothy to feed the captive bison herds as well as the expanding elk herds. The bison enclosure in the Lamar Valley became known as the Lamar Buffalo Ranch. When the army left the park in 1918, the bison population was estimated to have increased to 400 individuals. =Transition to the National Park Service= Mounted U.S. Army Cavalryman After serving more than six years as the Acting Superintendent, Major John Pitcher was replaced by Lieutenant General Samuel B.M. Young (U.S. Army retired) in June 1907. Young was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, James Rudolph Garfield as full superintendent of the park. Although Young was a senior officer, command of the troops at Fort Yellowstone was given to Major H. T. Allen. Young's lasting contribution to Fort Yellowstone's history was his proposal to replace the army with a force of Civilian Guards. Young, who had served as Acting Superintendent as a Captain in 1897 recognized the dysfunctional and complicated relationships between the War Department, Corps of Engineers and Interior Department which Congress knew was adversely impacting the successful administration of the park. Young's proposal was not acted upon, but it did set the stage for a decade of change that ultimately saw the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 as well as a Park Ranger force to protect the national parks. Although the cavalry had been successful in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and the high level of training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously. Throughout 1915‚Äì16, the Interior Department was organizing itself to deal with the growing number of national parks and ultimately, Congress created the National Park Service on August 25, 1916. Prior to the establishment of the National Park Service, in July 1916 the War Department agreed to withdraw troops from Yellowstone as of October 1, 1916, which was the end of the park visitation season. At the same time, the War Department agreed to discharge a select number of the current volunteer cavalry contingent on September 29, 1916, so they could go to work for the National Park Service as Park Rangers. Unfortunately, Congress failed to appropriate funds for the new National Park Service for 1917 and the ranger force was disbanded in the spring of 1917. Political pressure from the Montana Congressional delegation over the loss of economic revenue from the army presence resulted in the recall of the army and 450 soldiers from the 7th Cavalry Regiment were sent back to Fort Yellowstone to protect the park. Administrative control remained with the Interior Department under the supervision of Acting Superintendent Chester Allinson Lindsley, a long time civilian employee in the park. Relations between the army, the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department continued to be contentious in 1917‚Äì1918 as disagreements over proposed construction, ownership of buildings and use of personnel persisted. In 1918, Director of the National Park Service Stephen Mather convinced Congress and the War Department that civilian control of the National Parks under the National Park Service was the right solution. On October 31, 1918, the army left Yellowstone for the last time. =Legacy= Guard duty 1903 John Muir a foremost American naturalist and often called the \\"Father of the National Parks\\" once wrote: \\"Blessings on Uncle Sam's Soldiers. They have done the job well, and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy.\\" While Yellowstone was under army management, the activities, policies and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved a wide variety of problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry in the last years of army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21st century.

It appears to the naked eye to be a single star and is the second-brightest star in its constellation with an apparent visual magnitude varying between 3.65 and 3.72. Based on parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately 112 light-years from the Sun. The two components are designated Beta Coronae Borealis A (officially named Nusakan , the traditional name of the system) and B Nomenclature Œ≤ Coronae Borealis (Latinised to Beta Coronae Borealis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Beta Coronae Borealis A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Nusakan, from Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ŸÇÿßŸÜ al-nasaqƒÅn \\"the two lines [of stars]\\", originally a pair of asterisms - a northern line mostly in Hercules, and a southern line in Serpens and Ophiuchus. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Nusakan for the component Beta Coronae Borealis A on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU- approved Star Names.

Properties Œ≤ Coronae Borealis is the 2nd-brightest star in the constellation Corona Borealis Beta Coronae Borealis was first announced to be a binary star in 1907, based on spectroscopic observations at Lick Observatory; J. B. Cannon published an orbit in 1914, finding a period of 40.9 days. Later spectroscopic investigations by F. J. Neubauer at Lick, published in 1944, found a period of 10.5 years, with no evidence for the 41-day periodicity. Antoine Labeyrie and his coworkers resolved the pair by speckle interferometry in 1973 and found that the two stars were separated by about 0.25 arcseconds; this work was published in 1974. The pair was also observed visually by Coteau in 1973. A number of orbits were subsequently published using visual and speckle-interferometric observations, both alone and in conjunction with spectroscopic data.. In 1999, S√∂derhjelm published an orbit using speckle-interferometric data together with Hipparcos observations. Neubauer's 1944 work found a small variation in the radial velocity of Beta Coronae Borealis with a periodicity of 320 days, suggesting the presence of a third, lighter, body in the system. A 1999 study of the system by long- baseline infrared interferometry performed at Palomar Observatory found no evidence for this, and showed that any tertiary companion with this period must have mass 10 Jupiter masses or below. This study also found very weak evidence for the presence of a companion with a shorter, 21-day, period, but the data was insufficient to draw a positive conclusion. The brighter component, Beta Coronae Borealis A, is a Rapidly oscillating Ap star, with a period of 16.2 minutes. Of spectral type A5V with a surface temperature of around 7980 K, it has around 2.09 times the mass of the Sun, 2.63 times its radius and 25.3 times its luminosity. The smaller star is a main sequence star with spectral type F2, a surface temperature of around 6750 K, around 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, 1.56 times its radius, and between 4 and 5 times its luminosity. The system is around 530 million years old.

Set in 1962 in the rural Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, it was the first in a projected trilogy of films centred on the experiences of an awkward Australian boy, based on the childhood of writer/director John Duigan. The film itself is a series of interconnected segments narrated by Danny who recollects how he and Freya grew apart over the course of one year. Although the trilogy never came to fruition, it was followed by a 1991 sequel, Flirting. The film was the recipient of the 1987 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film, a prize which Flirting also won in 1990. Plot In the 1960s, Danny, a thin, socially awkward adolescent, falls in love with his best friend Freya in rural New South Wales, Australia. Unfortunately for him, she is attracted to Trevor, a high school rugby star, larrikin and petty criminal who helps Danny with the school bullies. Shortly after sleeping with Freya at the abandoned house, Trevor steals a car for a joyride and is arrested and sent to juvenile detention; it is while he is away that Freya reveals to Danny that she is pregnant. Danny offers to marry her and claim that the child is his, but Freya refuses, saying that she does not want to marry anyone. Meanwhile, intrigued by a locket left to Freya by an elderly friend of theirs who recently died‚Äîengraved \\"SEA\\"‚ÄîDanny begins to investigate the town's past, and discovers a lone cross in the cemetery bearing those initials, belonging to a \\"Sara Elizabeth Amery\\", who died days after Freya was born. Through inquiries with his parents, Danny learns that Sara was well known for her sexual promiscuity years ago, and that she was Freya's biological mother, who died trying to give birth by herself at the abandoned house. Meanwhile, Trevor breaks out of detention, steals another car, and severely wounds a store clerk during an armed robbery. Trevor returns to town long enough to reunite with Freya at the abandoned house, and learn that she is pregnant. The police arrive at Trevor's hiding place, but Danny warns him, and Trevor is able to escape. The police then run his car off the road during the course of the pursuit, and Trevor dies the next day. Freya disappears, and later suffers a miscarriage and hypothermia until Danny finds her (at the abandoned house) and takes her to the hospital. Hesitantly, Danny reveals the identity of Freya's mother to her. Realising the stigma now hanging over her, Freya decides to leave on the night train for the city. At the station, Danny gives her his life's savings to support herself and sees her off‚Äîpromising their friendship to one another and to keep in touch. Later, Danny travels to their favourite hangout spot and carves Freya's, Trevor's and his name into a rock, as his adult self informs the audience that he never saw Freya again.

He was unable to get the film funded so wrote a prequel, The Year My Voice Broke, based on the leading character growing up in a country town. Duigan had worked with Kennedy Miller making the miniseries Vietnam and they agreed to make the film as one of four telemovies they were making for the Channel Ten network. Duigan was allowed to make the film on 35 mm. The film was shot, but not set, in Braidwood, New South Wales. It had several working titles, including Reflections of a Golden Childhood and Museum of Desire. Music The main theme used in the film is \\"The Lark Ascending\\" by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. At a 2005 special-event screening in Sydney, director John Duigan stated that he chose the piece as he felt it complemented Danny's adolescent yearning. Additional source music featured in the film includes: *\\"Apache\\", performed by The Shadows *\\"Corinna Corinna\\", performed by Ray Peterson *\\"Temptation\\", performed by The Everly Brothers *\\"Tower of Strength\\" and \\"A Hundred Pounds of Clay\\", performed by Gene McDaniels *\\"Diana\\", performed by Paul Anka *\\"(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance\\", performed by Gene Pitney *\\"Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands\\", performed by The Delltones *\\"I Remember You\\", performed by Frank Ifield *\\"That's the Way Boys Are\\", performed by Lesley Gore All of the songs are to period, except \\"That's the Way Boys Are\\", which was released in 1964. Release The Year My Voice Broke grossed $1,513,000 at the box office in Australia,Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office which is equivalent to $3,041,130 in 2009 dollars. The U.S. box office was $213,901.General Film Information - The Year My Voice Broke The movie was entered in the AFI Awards, despite protests that it was a telemovie. However, it was allowed in because Duigan argued it was shot in 35 mm and designed as a feature. The movie won five AFI Awards, which led to Hoyts picking it up and releasing it as a feature film. Home media In America, the film was first released on VHS in 1988 by International Video Entertainment. It was later re- released digitally in 2015 by its successor, Lionsgate. A 21st-anniversary special-edition DVD was released in December 2008. Special features include an introduction by George Miller and a 50-minute retrospective, with Duigan interviewing Loene Carmen and Ben Mendelsohn in Australia and Noah Taylor in England. Awards The film received the following 1987 AFI Awards: *Best Film (Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, George Miller) *Best Direction (John Duigan) *Best Original Screenplay (John Duigan) *Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ben Mendelsohn) *Members Prize The film was also nominated for the following 1987 AFI Awards: *Best Actor in a lead role (Noah Taylor) *Best Actress in a lead role (Loene Carmen) *Best Achievement in Editing (Neil Thumpston) In commenting about the film, the AFI website states: References External links  *The Year My Voice Broke at Oz Movies *The Year My Voice Broke at the National Film and Sound Archive  Category:1987 films Category:1980s coming-of-age drama films Category:Australian films Category:Australian coming-of-age drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by John Duigan Category:Films set in 1962 Category:Films set in New South Wales Category:Teenage pregnancy in film Category:Films produced by Doug Mitchell Category:1987 drama films ","title":"The Year My Voice Broke"},{"id":"2376438","text":"right The Chennai Veerans was a Tier-1 level field hockey team Premier Hockey League in India.

The university is associated with Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), and its administrative offices are in the Don and Nancy de Laski Education Center on the main A.R.E. campus. The university is nationally accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC), which is a member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), for its distance education and hybrid programs. The university also maintains licensure with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). History Atlantic University received its charter on April 29, 1930, with a goal of offering a liberal arts education through a holistic perspective. The university closed in 1931, but the charter was kept active. In the fall semester of 1985, Atlantic University reopened as a graduate school with a curriculum that focused on Transpersonal Studies. The first class graduated in 1989. Initially the Master of Arts in Transpersonal Studies was offered as a residential program with a few independent study distance education options via a correspondence course model. Over the years, the ratio of distance to residential courses changed until the majority of courses were taught as distance education. The method of instruction of distance courses also changed from a correspondence course model to web-based courses to courses on CD. In 2010, the conversion to a truly online school with three semesters began. As the university changed, continuing education and personal enrichment courses were added. In 2017, the university changed from three 14-week semesters to four 12-week semesters allowing for students to complete their program more efficiently. In recent years, the Master of Arts in Transpersonal Studies was changed to Master of Arts in Transpersonal Psychology, thus making the program more accessible and understandable to the outside public. In addition to the Transpersonal psychology degree, Atlantic University offers a Master of Arts in Mindful Leadership, a Graduate Certificate in Regression Hypnosis, a Graduate Certificate in Mindful Leadership, a non-credit certificate in Spiritual Guidance Mentor Training, and Lifelong Learning certificates to adult learners.

It began in the early 1970s and lasted until the mid-late 1980s. The era also marked the emergence of Ozploitation, a film genre characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture. Background The Australian film industry declined after World War II, coming to a virtual stop by the early 1960s. The Gorton (1968‚Äì71) and Whitlam Governments (1972‚Äì75) intervened and rescued the industry from its expected oblivion. The federal and several state governments established bodies to assist with the funding of film production and the training of film makers through the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, which fostered a new generation of Australian filmmakers who were able to bring their visions to the screen. The 1970s saw a huge renaissance of the Australian film industry. Australia produced nearly 400 films between 1970 and 1985, more than had been made in the history of the Australian film industry. In contrast to pre-New Wave films, New Wave films are often viewed as fresh and creative, possessing \\"a vitality, a love of open spaces and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality\\".

Biography He was born in Santiago de Chile, the son of Antonio de la Lastra Cort√©s and of Mar√≠a de la Sotta y √Åguila. As a young man, he was sent to Spain to pursue his studies, and served in the Royal Spanish Navy, was promoted to navy lieutenant in 1803, and remained till 1807. He returned to Chile in 1811. From the very beginning was a part of the independence movement that swept Chile from 1810 onwards. Once back he held different military assignments, enlisted in the revolutionary army, and was appointed political and military governor of Valparaiso. He organized in that port the militia and naval reserve, and also established arsenals for its defence. In 1811, he was a substitute Deputy (representing Concepcion) to the first National Congress, that met between July 4 and December 2 of that year. On October 26, 1812, he was also one of the signataries of the Constitutional Regulation of 1812. He was named governor of Valparaiso and also was the first commander of the just created Chilean navy between 1812 and 1814. Since he had relations with the Carrera family (his brother, Manuel de la Lastra was married to Javiera Carrera, the sister of Jos√© Miguel Carrera) de la Lastra assumed power after the first (second for some) dictatorship of Jos√© Miguel Carrera, while he was going to fight against the Spanish troops commanded by Antonio Pareja and later by Gabino Gainza. On March 14, 1814, he was chosen Supreme Director of Chile and promoted to full colonel. He governed with this title until July 23, 1814. He then was forced to sign the Treaty of Lircay with the Spanish and to change back the flag created by Carrera to the Spanish flag. He was deposed as a consequence of this event. At this point Carrera came back to Santiago and started his second (third for some authorities) dictatorship. After the defeat of Rancagua, on October 2, 1814, Francisco de la Lastra Lastra was taken prisoner and sent to Juan Fern√°ndez Islands (a group of islands located west to Am√©rica) where he suffered many privations. He was liberated after the victory of Chacabuco, re-entered the service, and, after attaining the rank of colonel, was for the second time appointed (in 1817) governor and general commander of the navy at Valparaiso. In 1823 he was promoted to Intendant of Santiago and Privy Councillor. As such, he became temporary Supreme Director, from December 30, 1823 until January 3, 1824, while the proprietary, General Ramon Freire, was away. In the same year he was commissioned by the government to arrange and organize the navy. In 1825 he was appointed for the third time governor of Valparaiso. In 1829 he was charged with the general inspection of the army, and soon afterward appointed minister of war and the navy, with the charge of reorganizing the navy. That year he attained the rank of Navy Captain and Brigade General. He participated in the Chilean Civil War of 1829. He then retired from public life till 1839, and in 1841 became a member of the court of appeals. In 1841 also he was named a member of the Marcial Court. He was elected a deputy to congress for Lautaro, between 1843 and 1846; and became the vice-president of the chamber on November 11, 1844. He died in Santiago, on May 13, 1852.

It was the longest continually operated slate mine in the world until its closure in 2003. Foel Grochan is the quarry on the north side of the valley, facing Ceunant Ddu and Hen Gloddfa on the south; all three were worked as a single concern throughout their history. Rock was mainly extracted underground, though all three quarries had open pits as well.  History  Aberllefenni quarry may have started operating as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date is 1500 when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from the mine. In the seventeenth century the Lloyd family owned the quarry, and it passed to the Campbell family in 1725. In 1806, John Davies gained control which passed to the executor of his estate, Pryce Jones, in 1824. It was Davies who first organised commercial quarrying at Aberllefenni around 1810. Although only 3 workers were employed in 1825, by 1854 the quarry was producing significant amounts of slate; that year the enormous \\"Alma\\" open chamber at the top of Foel Grochan was named after the Battle of the Alma. In 1859, the quarry was sold to Colonel Robert Davies Jones, trading under the name Aberllefenni Slate Quarries. In 1873, the quarry appointed Robert Hughes as manager, and he quickly modernised working practices there. He installed new machinery in the extended mill, powered by a large waterwheel. That year the quarry employed 180 men. By 1879, the quarry was employing 169 men and produced nearly 4700 tons of finished slate and slab. The number of employees peaked in 1890 at 190. Production fluctuated but was trending downwards during the 1890s and 1900s. In 1908, the number of employees fell below 100 and declined further to 71 in 1910. The First World War saw a downturn in production in the whole industry, including at Aberllefenni. After the war there was a short boom into the early 1920s, but then the price of slate began to fall. By the early 1930s, the industry was in a deep depression, with a 3-day week being worked for part of 1933. In 1935 the quarry was leased by Sir Henry Haydn Jones, owner of the Bryn Eglwys quarry near Abergynolwyn and the Talyllyn Railway that served it. There was some improvement during the late 1930s, with 140 workers employed in 1940. But the Second World War brought further drops in production, with the number of men fell to 40 in 1944. After the war, the industry continued a slow decline, with industrial action closing the quarry for part of 1947. During the 1950s only about 40 men were working, all in Foel Grochan quarry. In 1956, brothers Gwilym and Dewi Lloyd took over the quarry under the name Wincilate Ltd. Rapid modernization and mechanisation of the quarry allowed it to continue to produce slate into the 1990s. Aberllefenni was the last working slate mine south of Blaenau Ffestiniog. However, by 2002 it was no longer economical to extract slate at Aberllefenni and the mine closed in 2003. The slate mill continues to operate, processing slate imported from Blaenau Ffestiniog, Penrhyn and China. Small pieces of Aberllefenni slate are still available for name plates.  Operations  Map of Aberllefenni area quarries and tramways Inside the Aberllefenni mill around 1885 The rear of the main mill around 1885. The quarry office is to the right of the mill building with the Ratgoed Tramway passing behind One of the reasons for Aberllefenni's continued use was the high quality of the slate extracted. There are two major veins of slate running parallel to each other through this region of mid-Wales, the Broad Vein and the Narrow Vein, the latter of which Aberllefenni extracted. The broad vein is of considerably poorer quality than the narrow vein, and the slate it produces is of little use in roofing slates or polished surfaces. Instead it was used in walls, fences and hardcore. The narrow vein was of much better quality and could be used in much higher quality applications and fetched higher prices. Slate extracted from the narrow vein at Aberllefenni is deep blue and extremely hard and dense. It resists fine splitting, so most of the mines' product was large cut slabs rather than split roofing slates. Foel Grochan mine consists of eight near-horizontal tunnels at approximately vertical separation. These were bored into the valley side just to the north of the near-vertical narrow vein. Each tunnel connected to a large chamber from which the rock was extracted. These chambers ranged from to in length with of rock left between the bottom of one chamber and the top of the next lower chamber. As more slate was extracted, several of the upper chambers were joined vertically to form an extremely large cavern known as Twll Golau which is open at the top.  Transportation  From the mid-1850s the quarries at Aberllefenni were connected to the Corris Railway, a narrow gauge railway which carried slate down the Dulas Valley to Machynlleth. There it was transferred to the standard gauge Cambrian Railways and shipped throughout Great Britain. The Aberllefenni quarries continued to dispatch slate on the Corris Railway until its closure in 1948. After 1948, the short tramway connecting the quarries to the slate cutting shed at Aberllefenni continued in use. Although locomotives were used underground, the tramway was operated by horse haulage. This continued until the early 1960s, when a tractor replaced the horses. The tramway was removed in the late 1970s, being replaced with lorries and forklift trucks. Underground, the gauge tramway continued in use, operated by battery electric locomotives until the end of working in 2003.

It is thought to have been an important producer of revenue, and one that rebelled against the Judahite crown. It is assigned to the tribe of Judah as one of the 13 Kohanic cities during the Israelite settlement (Joshua 21:13). The town revolted during the reign of King Jehoram of Judah, according to 2 Kings 8:22 and 2 Chronicles 21:10, because Jehoram \\"had abandoned [the] God of his fathers\\". The revolt took place at the same time as Edom revolted against Judean rule (2 Kings 8:20-22). Josiah, King of Judah, married Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah (1 Chronicles 3:15; 2 Kings 23:31-32;2 Kings 24:17-18; Jeremiah 22:11). Two of their sons, Jehoahaz and Zedekiah also became Kings of Judah. According to the narrative at (2 Chronicles 32:2021a, an angel of Yahweh destroyed the host of Sennacherib's army, and at 2 Kings:19:35, the number of Assyrian soldiers killed is claimed to have amounted to 185,000. Kenneth Kitchen, for one, found no difficulty in the traditional account, which has Libnah attacked after Lachish. The large number of troops reportedly dying overnight is explained as possibly due to poisoning,Kenneth Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003 pp.41-43 and the Targum version refers to pestilence. That Sennacherib's army may have attacked Libnah in 701 BCE is possible, but the various biblical reports are, recent scholarship has argued, somewhat confused, having Libnah attacked after Hezekiah had already surrendered at Lachish. Since Sennacherib attacked from the north, it is odd that he would move back to conquer a town in the north after a victory in the south. It is possible that the editor reversed the historical chronology. William R. Gallagher, Sennacherib's Campaign to Judah: New Studies, BRILL, 1999 p.220.John Bright, A History of Israel, 4th.ed.

Among other objections, the Military claimed that its integrity and discipline would be undermined if soldiers who mutinied in the 2000 upheaval were to be pardoned. The military's opposition to the Bill culminated in a coup d'√©tat in December 2006. The power struggle On 13 May 2005, Bainimarama spoke out against the proposal, calling it \\"Reconciliation bull\\" and vowing that he and the military would oppose the legislation, which detractors say is a sham to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who played roles in the coup. His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and into June, further strained his already tense relationship with the government. Bainimarama was supported by Army spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni, who said on 16 May that a meeting of senior officers had resolved to try to prevent the passage of the legislation. \\"We are not in favour of the Bill that proposes to offer amnesty for coup perpetrators in 2000, and will do all we can to oppose it,\\" Leweni said. Bainimarama said on 1 June that having undergone three coups in eighteen years, Fiji could not be compared to other commonwealth countries. He said this in response to claims by Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola that Fiji was the only country in the Commonwealth of Nations whose Military commander dared to oppose government policy. Bainimarama refused to say what the military would do if the government insisted on passing the bill, saying that they would cross that bridge when they came to it. Tensions escalated after 4 June, when Bainimarama publicly accused Prime Minister Qarase of having snubbed a military parade the previous day, in honour of Fijian soldiers returning from peacekeeping missions in East Timor. Commodore Bainimarama reiterated the Military's opposition to the legislation on 24 August. He asserted that it was the Military's prerogative to decide on the bill, as it was they and not the government that was responsible for the stability currently enjoyed by Fijian citizens. In a four-page statement, Bainimarama said that the Military, the Police, and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had done much to restore stability to Fiji, with no assistance whatsoever from the government. On 12 October, Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni emphasized that the Military still wanted the bill withdrawn in its entirety. The amendments to the amnesty clauses hinted at by Prime Minister Qarase were not a sufficient guarantee that no coup perpetrators would be released, he said. He added that while the Military was committed to protecting the democratically elected government, it would not allow supporters of the 2000 coup to \\"bulldoze\\" the legislation through. Leweni reiterated this stance on 28 November. \\"We stated earlier that we do not want this bill at all and even if there are amendments we will still not support its implementation,\\" he said. He threatened legal action if the bill, in any form, was passed. He was supported by Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, who said that the bill in its entirety was \\"unconstitutional\\" and needed to be withdrawn, and if not, challenged in the courts. Calls to discipline the military On 29 May, more than 20 military officers, dressed in uniform, sat in the visitors' gallery in Parliament in a silent protest against the legislation. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola labelled Bainimarama \\"arrogant,\\" saying that he was the only military commander in the commonwealth with the effrontery to interfere in political affairs. While conceding that as citizens, soldiers had a right to observe parliamentary proceedings, they should have worn civilian clothes so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale called for an investigation into why the officers had been in Parliament during work hours, and into why they had been in uniform. =Conservative Alliance calls for Bainimarama to be disciplined= The Conservative Alliance (CAMV), the junior partner in Fiji's coalition government, called on Bainimarama and Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes to resign for \\"making a mockery of (Fiji's) judicial systems,\\" and Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola labelled Bainimarama \\"arrogant,\\" saying that he was the only military commander in the commonwealth with the effrontery to interfere in political affairs. Bainimarama retorted on 1 June that having undergone three coups in eighteen years, Fiji could not be compared to other commonwealth countries. On 15 July, Cakobau called for Bainimarama to be disciplined for insubordination, while Jale Baba, National Director of the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua, said that \\"some of the statements made by Commodore Bainimarama were against the institution he worked for.\\" However, Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who had been critical of Bainimarama in the past, supported him this time, saying that the reason why Bainimarama opposed the legislation was that he understood what it was really about. =Vosanibola warns Bainimarama= On 9 June, Vosanibola reacted to warnings from Bainimarama that the military might be forced to \\"open up\\" by reiterating his previous threats to discipline Bainimarama if he failed to act in accordance with government policy and submit any complaints through the correct channels. On 20 June, the Fiji Times reported that \\"a reliable source\\" close to the government had accused President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, as the Military Commander-in-Chief, of refusing repeated requests from Vosanibola to institute disciplinary measures against Bainimarama. The source cited Section 96 of the Constitution, which requires the President to act on the advice of the appropriate Cabinet Minister, in this case the Home Affairs Minister, and accused him of refusing to do so. This, he said, was making the Minister look foolish and incompetent. On 30 June, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale said that there was no problem between the government and the military, but added, \\"The only problem is an army leadership that thinks it rules the Government when it is supposed to be the other way around.\\" He claimed that measures were underway to resolve the dispute. Bale was responding to concerns raised by the Nadroga-Navosa Provincial Council about the government's passage of controversial legislation in the face of opposition from the military, as well as from foreign governments. Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola finally admitted on 13 July that the government was constitutionally powerless to do anything to discipline the Military commander. He said that the government was very concerned about Bainimarama's behaviour, and accused the media of exacerbating the tensions. \\"You (the media) can play a major role and come to us first instead of coming to us after highlighting what he (Bainimarama) has said,\\" Vosanibola told the Fiji Times. On 15 July, Vosanibola appeared to backtrack somewhat, saying that the government was looking at disciplinary options short of removing the commander from his position. According to the Fiji Times, he admitted having paid several visits to President Iloilo over the matter. =Alleged offer to form pro-government mercenary force= Also on 15 July, the Fiji Sun newspaper quoted a former soldier, who claims to be an Israeli-trained Fijian security officer, as having met the Prime Minister and the Home Affairs Minister to offer to set up a mercenary force, which he called a \\"protection squad,\\" to defend the government against any threat from the Military. It would take less than a week to assemble the squad, he was reported as saying. Fiji Live reported that Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes had expressed surprise at the news, saying that as one of the country's top security officers, he knew nothing about the matter. Commodore Bainimarama, for his part, said from New Caledonia that the man was a \\"loser\\" who had been dishonourably discharged from the Fijian Army some time before. On 19 July, the government convened a meeting of the National Security Council, comprising Prime Minister Qarase, Attorney-General Bale, Finance Minister Ratu Jone Kubuabola, Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola, and Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola, to discuss the increasing tension between the government and the military. The Ministers emerged from the Council meeting tight-lipped and unwilling to answer questions pertaining to the relationship between the government and the military, except to say that the security situation was \\"calm\\" and \\"stable.\\" Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola said that the government did not need the help of mercenaries, as offered by Raqio. Prime Minister Qarase, for his part, said that he was satisfied with military and police assurances about the security situation. \\"I would like to reiterate the assurances given by the military and police that the situation in the country is stable,\\" the Prime Minister said. Meanwhile, military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that the military had not provided the Security Council with any briefing. =Alleged attempt to dismiss commander= On 20 July, Bainimarama went public with allegations that Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola had attempted to dismiss him in June. The Cabinet had, he claimed, discussed a letter of termination presented by Vosanibola. Meanwhile, Radio Australia admitted its embarrassment over a telephone interview conducted, supposedly with Bainimarama, on 18 July. Bainimarama denied having given the interview, and Radio Australia admitted the next day that the person who answered the call, whom they now believed to have been a member of Bainimarama's staff, appeared to have been impersonating him. =Further criticism of commander= In a parliamentary speech on 10 August, Fisheries Minister Konisi Yabaki accused the opposition Fiji Labour Party of having manipulated the military, as well as the police, to defy the government. He said they had \\"poisoned the minds of the current leadership in the disciplined forces to publicly express their views against an elected Government without fear of retribution or recrimination.\\" On 3 October, Prime Minister Qarase called on Bainimarama to respect the authority of the government. He said that Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola was studying Bainimarama's recent comments, and that the government would duly decide what action to take in response. Efforts to defuse the quarrel On 21 June, Bainimarama's predecessors as Military commander, Sitiveni Rabuka (who supports the government's proposed reconciliation commission) and Epeli Ganilau (who opposes it) both called on the government to settle its quarrel with Bainimarama and stop \\"passing the buck\\" to the President. Both men, despite their differences, had already defended Bainimarama's right to speak out, because maintaining stability is the responsibility of the Military. \\"They have a duty to protect the country 24 hours a day and have every right to be part of those observing the tabling of the bill,\\" Rabuka said on 2 June. The day before, Ganilau had said that there was nothing sinister about the military being present to observe the tabling of legislation. Rabuka reiterated on 21 June that Bainimarama was within his rights to speak out, because he would be answerable if anything happened. Prime Minister Qarase said on 31 July that he and Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola considered the \\"Pacific way\\" of dialogue to be the best option to solve the impasse between the government and the military. He said he was \\"always available\\" to enter into dialogue with Commodore Bainimarama. On 3 August, Prime Minister Qarase said that he was taking urgent steps to resolve the tension with the Military. He would consider, he said, the Military's views. The Prime Minister said that the issue was a very sensitive one, and that people should not think about it emotionally. On 12 August, Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola insisted that his relationship with the Commodore Bainimarama was good, and that the government was on good terms with the Military. He was looking at ways to resolve the disagreements between the government and the Military, he added. \\"We will try and smooth the things with the army. I‚Äôm looking forward to meet him after this Parliament sitting is over,\\" Vosanibola said. Threat to depose the government On 5 June, Bainimarama reiterated his opposition to the proposed reconciliation commission, and said that if the government continued to \\"bulldoze\\" it through Parliament, he would be forced to \\"open up.\\" He did not elaborate on what he meant by that. On 11 July, Bainimarama issued one of his strongest-worded challenges yet to the government, saying that it was forcing the country into the same anarchy as in 2000. The Reconciliation and Unity Bill would never allow the country to live in peace, he said. In an eight-page statement, he warned that the Military was would take decisive action against any \\"destabilisers\\" - among whom he named Attorney-General Bale and Ministry of Reconciliation Chief Executive Apisalome Tudreu. \\"The military will dish out the same fate we dealt George Speight and his group to anyone whom we think deserves this treatment,\\" Bainimarama said. He said that he would arrest and put on trial anyone who threatened the stability of Fiji. Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola said in response to Bainimarama's latest attack that it was hurting the fine reputation of the Fijian army, which he said was \\"a global power\\" in peacemaking - but which suffered from a present leadership that he saw as \\"questionable.\\" He called on Bainimarama to respect the rule of law and the parliamentary process. Vosanibola did not, however, repeat previous threats to discipline Bainimarama. The next day, it was revealed that a draft document signed by Commodore Bainimarama had originally contained a direct threat to overthrow the government if the bill went through. \\"The RFMF must stop the Bill from passing or get rid of the Government if it is passed. We can recover without this government, we cannot recover from this Bill,\\" said part of an emboldened paragraph, which was edited out of the document, part of the Military's draft submission to the parliamentary committee considering the bill, before publication. The document accused Prime Minister Qarase and Attorney-General Bale of playing the race card deliberately for political reasons. On 28 July, Bainimarama denied media reports that the Military had been on high alert since the introduction of the bill. The reports surfaced in the light of revelations that security had been tightened at the Queen Elizabeth Barracks in the Suva suburb of Nabua, and that security for President Iloilo had also been strengthened. Bainimarama's denial followed a report by Television New Zealand on 26 July that Fiji's intelligence service was being put on high alert to counter coup threats from the Military. =Police tighten security= The acting Assistant Superintendent of Police, Unaisi Vuniwaqa, said on 3 August that the police regarded the Military as a possible threat to national stability if the controversial legislation passed, and had taken steps to improve the security of the Parliamentary complex, with checkpoints being set up and plainclothes policemen and Tactical Response Unit guards posted. No one would be admitted to the complex without producing identity cards or receiving confirmation of their business from within the parliamentary secretariat. Military reservists working with the police had also been asked to state which body, Military or police, their allegiance lay with. \\"It's been something that has been on-going even before the Bill and we just wanted to gauge how many men we could rely on in case of emergency,\\" Vuniwaqa said. The same day, Colonel Rabukawaqa denied that there were any plans to overthrow the government. The earlier eight-page memo making such threats that had been leaked to the press was, he said, only a draft. It was \\"just a thought\\" that the Military leadership had considered but not taken further, and should not be taken seriously, he said. Parliamentary submission In its parliamentary submission on 29 June, the military claimed that its integrity would be undermined by the passage of the legislation. It expressed concern that soldiers jailed for their involvement in the 2000 coup and the mutinies that accompanied and followed it could be released under the bill's amnesty provisions, which would undermine military discipline and weaken the integrity of the military as an institution. The constitutional power of Commodore Bainimarama as Commander, as the person responsible for discipline, would also be degraded, the submission said. \\"The events of 2000 showed that the schism that split the military, the country, judiciary, the police and even families was embedded and took over four years to expunge,\\" the statement said. \\"Any move such as the use of amnesty to allow convicted soldiers to re-enter the rank and file of the military will violate the very basis upon which the strength of the military lies.\\" Incident at the Fiji Law Society The Fiji Times reported on 3 July (Monday) that Bainimarama had turned down an invitation to address the Fiji Law Society over the weekend. Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki confirmed that Bainimarama had been scheduled to speak. Bainimarama was said to be angry with Law Society President Graeme Leung, a fellow-opponent of the Reconciliation and Unity Bill, for saying that opposing the legislation was not the prerogative of the military. Meanwhile, it was reported on 5 July that Bainimarama had called the legislation a form of \\"ethnic cleansing\\". Lobbying the villages, provinces, chiefs On 21 June, Bainimarama announced that his officers would spend the following six weeks visiting villages to inform the population of the military's perception of the bill, which they had translated into Fijian. The announcement was met with immediate opposition from the Kadavu Provincial Council, which supports the legislation. The Council's youth coordinator, Sitiveni Qio, said that soldiers campaigning against the bill would not be welcome in Kadavu. Bainimarama said on 24 August that more than 400 villages around Fiji had informed the visiting Military teams that they were opposed to the bill. He stressed that the Military would not allow any more coups to take palace in Fiji. =Reaction to bill's endorsement by provincial councils= On 26 July, Bainimarama declared that the military would continue to oppose the legislation, despite its endorsement by the Councils of all fifteen Provinces and dependencies. He said that the bill was \\"morally, ethically, and legally wrong,\\" and that the military would never support it. The Provincial Council representatives who supported the bill were the same people who supported George Speight in 2000, he claimed. Addressing more than 700 soldiers at a passing out parade, he said that reconciliation could not be legislated and could succeed only if it came from the hearts of those responsible for the crime. Passage of the Unity Bill would, he predicted, undermine the four arms of government - the police, the Department of Public Prosecutions, the Judiciary, and the Military, and would lead people to believe that they could get away acts of treason. If so, there would be no end to the culture of coups, he said. He concluded by quoting from the Bible that one reaps what one sows. =Address to the Great Council of Chiefs= Addressing a special meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs in Lami on 28 July, Bainimarama said that the legislation would strip the Military of its ability to carry out its responsibilities in an emergency and would weaken national security. In a 31-page speech that took more than an hour to deliver, he accused the government of harbouring in its ranks persons involved in coup-related crimes in 2000. \\"Who's promoting the Bill? These are people in the current Government who participated in the 2000 coup. Some have been convicted, others are facing trial, there are still others left whom the long arm of the law should get at.\\" The commander took pains to emphasize, however, that the Military was not against the government. The issue, as he saw it, was the rule of law, not the government of the day. \\"The Bill will legitimise the 2000 coup and will weaken the law and order agencies,\\" he said. \\"All the good work of rebuilding Fiji to what it is today will be undone.\\" The world community would see a country that condones law-breakers, he maintained. \\"Why should only a few people be freed and not others when we are all serving under the same law? he asked rhetorically. His speech, laced with quotes from the Bible, urged the chiefs to \\"do right in the eyes of God\\" and reject the bill. \\"If you honourable chiefs agree that those involved in the coup be forgiven, it will prove that we support the wrong and will be at odds with the integrity of God,\\" he declared. The commander criticized the Methodist Church for supporting the bill. \\"When we wrong God, he does not let us go ... When God's people (Jews) wronged him, he weakened them in battle and caused them to be captives in Babylon for 70 years,\\" he stated. He considered that reconciliation would be possible only after justice had been served. He reminded the chiefs that in 2000, they had not agreed to forgive the perpetrators of the coup, but had insisted that justice should take its course. He urged them to stand by that decision now. The commander did not get his way, however, as the Great Council ended up endorsing the bill, though with the qualification that the government should \\"consider\\" the objections raised by its opponents, including the Military. Bainimarama ended his address by reminding the chiefs that in 2000, they had not agreed to forgive the perpetrators of the coup, but had insisted that justice should take its course. He urged them to stand by that decision now. He closed by quoting Amos 5,24: \\"Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-falling stream.\\" =Bainimarama criticizes chiefs= On 29 July, Bainimarama issued a statement critical of the chiefs' decision to support the bill. He accused them of forgetting the decision they had made in 2000, that justice should take its course. \\"It is sad that they had forgotten that wise decision and have also forgotten the rest of the multi-racial society within which we live,\\" Bainimarama said. He reiterated that the bill was legally, morally, and ethically wrong, and that it condoned the unlawful events of 2000. He said that the chiefs' decision had alienated a large portion of society, and though he accepted that the decision had been taken, that the Military would continue to oppose the legislation. \\"We will rather air these concerns now than be called in to try to rebuild a society that has been devastated by civil upheaval for this is where we see our destiny if we continue down this path with the Bill,\\" he said. The commander said on 24 August that he was not surprised that the Great Council of Chiefs and the Methodist Church had both endorsed the controversial legislation, as some senior members of both institutions had supported the coup perpetrators in 2000, he alleged. His assertions were supported by former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka - who happens to be a supporter of the legislation. Disagreement with Australian government Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer visited Fiji for two days of talks, from 28 to 30 September. Downer expressed strong reservations about the legislation, but also rebuked the Fijian Military for \\"playing politics.\\" Downer's comments provoked an angry reaction from Bainimarama, who said that Australians had never had to live through a coup and therefore cannot understand what it is like. Disagreement with Methodist Church In 2005, Commodore Bainimarama strongly criticized some sections of the Methodist Church for supporting the Unity Bill, and said that in future, all pastors seeking chaplaincy assignments with Fijian military personnel travelling to the Middle East would be required to state their position on the legislation. Supporters of it need not apply, he said. Rabukawaqa speaks out Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa said on 1 August that it was not fair to expect taxpayers to foot the bill to compensate coup victims. Those seeking amnesty should pay, he said. Coup perpetrators would learn nothing from their mistakes, he said, if they were released without being required to compensate their victims. He defended the outspokenness of the Military on the bill. \\"We (the military) had always been called all over the globe to restore peace in other countries and we are only saying this because we do not want to do it in our own country,\\" he said. On 3 September, spokesman Rabukawaqa insisted that the Military was not opposed to the Qarase government as such, but only to the controversial Unity Bill, which he said had security implications. He also said that to offer pardons to only one category of criminal was inconsistent. \\"If we are going to forgive people, why don't we just forgive everybody and let everybody out of prison.\\" He said that the Military opposed the principle of compensation to coup victims being paid by the taxpayer; rather the perpetrators should be held accountable, he said. The Military had learned its lesson from the 1987 coups, Rabukawaqa said. Then, they had deposed the government of Timoci Bavadra (who was supported mostly by Indo-Fijian voters) in support of the Fijian ethno-nationalist cause, but later came to realize that they had been used. Those responsible for the 1987 coups cannot now be prosecuted, because Sitiveni Rabuka, the chief instigator of the coups who later became Prime Minister, had presided over a rewriting of the Constitution and had ensured the insertion of amnesty provisions. \\"History unfortunately teaches that if you come out successful, you can rewrite the books to reflect well on you and poorly on others,\\" Rabukawaqa said. No pardon for Speight - military On 6 November, Captain Leweni reiterated the Military's total opposition to any possible pardon for the coup's front man, George Speight. Leweni's public statement coincided with an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview with Commodore Bainimarama on its Asia Pacific program. Bainimarama vowed that Speight would never be released, and called the bill a \\"gimmick\\" to win the votes of Speight sympathizers. His own greatest challenge, he said, was to hold the loyalty of his troops. The two military statements provoked a mixed reaction from politicians and other public figures. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola declined to comment until he had seen Bainimarama's interview. Deputy Commissioner of Prisons Opeti Laladidi defended the Commander's right to speak his mind, but Cabinet Minister Samisoni Tikoinasau, Speight's older brother, said that Bainimarama's comments could take the country backwards and that he should be more cautious. He asserted that the government would not back down in the face of \\"threats\\" from the Military. Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale, for his part, thought it unlikely that the legislation would be used to pardon Speight, as it made a pardon conditional on the person seeking it making a complete confession about who planned and financed the crisis. Speight has repeatedly refused to make any statement to that effect. =Kotobalavu pleads with Bainimarama= On 22 December 2005, the Chief Executive Officer in the Prime Minister's Department, Joji Kotobalavu, pleaded with the Military not to use or threaten force to stop the Unity Bill. His appeal came in the wake of another public refusal from the Military commander to accept the legislation. \\"The RTU Bill is not going to happen,\\" he defiantly declared at a press conference the previous day. Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) General Secretary Jale Baba challenged Commodore Bainimarama to pursue his opposition to the bill through political, rather than military, channels. \\"He should join a political party and see if they will vote him in,\\" Baba declared. The Commander found support, however, from National Alliance Party President Ratu Epeli Ganilau and from Ema Druavesi, General Secretary of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), which ruled Fiji from 1992 through 1999. She accused the government of promoting the bill for \\"deliberate and dishonest motives,\\" alleging that its real purpose was to release all coup convicts. She also charged that public servants Anare Jale, Joji Kotobalavu, and Lesi Korovavala, along with the Attorney-General's Office, seemed to have a personal dislike for the Commander. Parliamentary vote delayed Prime Minister Qarase announced on 18 January that the tabling of the legislation for final parliamentary approval was being postponed until further notice, pending \\"consultations.\\" This move followed an extraordinary week which had seen unusual troop and naval deployments, rumours of a possible coup, and the dismissal of Acting Land Force Commander Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka for alleged insubordination, culminating in a meeting at Government House (the official residence of the President between the Prime Minister and Commodore Bainimarama under the auspices of Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi on 16 January. In a statement issued after the meeting, Madraiwiwi said that the Prime Minister had agreed to consider the grievances of the Military and to consult them about possible changes to the legislation. This was not clarified further at the time, but on the 18th, the Prime Minister went further and said that the process of consulting everybody could take a long time, and that it could no longer be guaranteed that the legislation would be passed in time for the 2006 parliamentary election. The same was true of other controversial bills opposed by the Military, including legislation defining indigenous fishing rights and establishing a separate indigenous court system, Qarase said. Jioji Kotobalavu, the Chief Executive Officer of the Prime Minister's Department, said that the bill was being revised, and that the Military would be briefed when the revision had been completed. Military still opposed Captain Leweni reiterated the Military's opposition to the bill 16 February 2006. The Military would never allow it to become law, he vowed. \\"As far as the RFMF (Military) is concerned the RTU Bill is a non-issue as we have promised it will not eventuate,\\" he said. Commodore Bainimarama later endorsed Leweni's comments, which followed a statement from the Prime Minister that the bill had not been abandoned and would not be. Early in March 2006, the Military warned the government not to reintroduce the bill should it win reelection on 6‚Äì13 May. The Military also advised the Great Council of Chiefs to pursue no further discussion of the bill, a charge rejected by Great Council General Secretary Asesela Sadole. 2006 military coup In late November 2006, Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase, one of which was the withdrawal of three controversial bills, including the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill. On 5 December, Bainimarama overthrew the government. Addressing the media to explain his actions, he stated that the Reconciliation Bill had to be prevented as it would have \\"undermined the Constitution\\".\\"Commander RFMF - Public Declaration of Military Takeover\\" , Fiji government website, 5 December 2006 He later added that, if the SDL party returned to power, he would tolerate it only as long as it did not attempt to re-introduce the Bill. \\"If you do it, I'll remove you,\\" he warned.\\"On my terms: Bainimarama points way ahead\\" , Fiji Times, 1 June 2008 References Category:Politics of Fiji ","title":"Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill"},{"id":"2376495","text":"Kalikiri is a town in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh state in India.

Smoke hoods are intended to protect victims of fire from the effects of smoke inhalation. A smoke hood is a predecessor to the gas mask. The first modern smoke hood design was by Garrett Morgan and patented in 1912. History Although the concept of air filtration masks dates back as far as Pliny the Elder, many early designs suffered from serious flaws, including an inability to adequately filter or provide enough air to the user, or design shortcomings that led to equipment that was either uncomfortable or difficult to don and use. The first known modern-design smoke hood was developed by Garrett Morgan and was patented in 1912. The Morgan hood represented a significant improvement in the engineering and operability of smoke hoods or masks. Due partly to race issues in the United States at the time, Morgan, an African American, and his device went largely unrecognized until 1916. During construction of a tunnel under Lake Erie, an explosion trapped a number of sandhogs in the partially completed tunnel and filled the space with toxic fumes. Two separate rescue attempts failed, and the rescue teams themselves ended up in need of rescuing. Morgan, along with his brother and two volunteers, entered wearing Morgan smoke hoods and rescued several men apiece, which prompted others to don Morgan hoods and join the rescue attempt. In the end, Morgan's smoke hood enabled the rescue of many of the previous rescuers and allowed Morgan himself to make four trips into the tunnel‚Äîa journey that, without the hood, was not possible even once. Modern hoods High-quality smoke hoods are generally constructed of heat- resistant material like Kapton, and can withstand relatively high temperatures. The most important part of a smoke hood is the filter that provides protection from the toxic byproducts of combustion. Virtually all smoke hood designs utilize some form of activated charcoal filter and particulate filter to screen out corrosive fumes like ammonia and chlorine, as well as acid gases like hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulfide. The defining characteristic of an effective smoke hood is the ability to convert deadly carbon monoxide to relatively harmless carbon dioxide through a catalytic process. They are included in preparedness kits, after the September 11 attacks. Preparedness lists, such as those presented by Ready.Gov, often recommend smoke hoods, although some lists use alternate names such as \\"fume hoods,\\" \\"respirator hoods,\\" or \\"self-rescue hoods.\\" As most modern construction contains materials that produce toxic smoke or fumes when burned, smoke hoods can allow people to make a safe escape from buildings when it might not otherwise be possible. =Positive-pressure hoods= Smoke hoods present on aircraft, also called protective breathing equipment (or PBEs), typically generate oxygen for anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. The oxygen is kept in a closed circuit, usually thanks to a tight neck seal. A scrubber system may be present to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide, and is breathable for around 20 minutes. When the oxygen supply ends, the hood will begin deflating and must be removed to avoid suffocation. These devices represent a subgroup of smoke hoods called positive-pressure respirators, which prevent the ingress of smoke or toxic gases by maintaining a higher air pressure inside the mask than outside. Consequently, any leak will cause fresh air to leak out of the mask, rather than toxic air to leak in.

There are context variables such as art, medicine and news--for example, a piece of content or site can be described as having depictions of nudes, but they are in an artistic context. A key point is that ICRA does not rate internet content, nor do it make value judgements about sites - the content providers self-label, and then parents and other concerned adults make a value judgement as to what is or is not appropriate content. The labelling was done using a web-based questionnaire. The content creators checked which of the elements in the questionnaire are present or absent from their Web sites, and a small file is automatically generated using the RDF format, which is then linked to the content on one or more domains. Formerly, the system was based on PICS. Users could then use content filtering software to censor various types of content. One such application, ICRAplus, was maintained by ICRA itself. ICRA also had a validator which tested all versions of ICRA and old RSACi labels. The content descriptions were revised in 2005 to enable easier application to a wide range of digital content, not just websites. The ICRA also intended to launch a service to verify the accuracy of ICRA labels and to provide this information to third-party tools and services, such as search engines. Alternative labelling projects include Quatro, an EU-funded project which integrates content labels with quality and trust marks, and its successor, QuatroPlus. Members ICRA's corporate members included: AOL, British Telecom, Microsoft, T-Online and Verizon. ICRA has been supported by the European Union's Internet Action Plan and various trusts and foundations. Through the Associate Membership scheme, individuals could join and support the work of the organization. Discontinuation As of October 2010, the ICRA labeling engine has been discontinued by FOSI. Additionally, FOSI has withdrawn all support for the ICRA rating system and taken down all documentation for labeling websites with ICRA ratings. The reason is that the ICRA label failed to gain widespread acceptance.

Originally broadcast on April 7, 2004, the episode (and its title) is a satire of the movie You Got Served, which was released earlier that year. In the episode, Stan has been challenged to a dance-off, and it's up to him to put together a team of South Park's best dancers to compete against a troupe from Orange County, California. While Butters has won awards for his dancing, he refuses to help Stan. He hasn't been able to dance since the tragic death of eleven audience members at his last competition. Plot Stan and his friends are playing with radio-controlled cars when a group of kids from Orange County come and dance in front of them, thus \\"serving\\" them. The group leaves after trash- talking Stan and the boys, who are left confused by the confrontation. The kids talk to Chef, unaware of what being \\"served\\" entails. Chef immediately shows great concern, and calls their parents to inform them about the ordeal and assure them that their children are safe. Later, over dinner, Randy Marsh gets upset about his son being served and \\"teaches\\" him to dance back with a few very basic line dancing steps to the tune of Billy Ray Cyrus' \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\". The next time Stan gets served by the Orange County kids, he serves them back, switching CDs on the boombox so that he may dance to \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\". \\"You just got F'd in the A!\\", says Cartman to the Orange County kids, who respond by declaring that \\"it's on\\"; there is now a dance contest to be had, the Orange County kids versus the best dancers in South Park. Sharon berates Randy about his telling and teaching Stan to dance back, as it was this which led to it being on. Randy goes to the Orange County team to apologize and make it clear that \\"it's not on; it's off\\", but the Orange County coach takes this as a challenge and goes on to serve Randy with some exceptional dance moves. Randy winds up in the hospital with the worst case of \\"being served\\" that his doctor has ever seen. After an exchange in the hospital, Stan hopes that he is finally being let off the hook, but Randy makes it clear that he expects Stan to avenge him at the competition. Stan goes out to find the town's best dancers: the leader of the goth kids' gang (who only agrees to do so after the others dismiss the dance contest as too conformist, thus showing he is non-conformist enough to refuse to conform to even his fellow goths), an Asian kid named Yao, who is a Dance Dance Revolution expert (yet claims he cannot dance without the machine, a pastime he perceives as stupid); and Mercedes, the manager of Raisins. Needing a fifth member, Mercedes suggests Butters, who was once state tap-dancing champion. When they ask him to join, however, he is stunned and runs away screaming. It is revealed through flashback that, in 2002, Butters' shoe flew off during the national Tap-Dancing Finals, hit a stage light in the rafters, and led to an extremely gruesome chain of events that left eight people in the audience dead. (Butters later learns to his horror from Stan that the total death count was actually eleven, because one woman was pregnant and two others committed suicide after the tragedy.) This all happened to the upbeat (and risqu√©) tune of \\"I've Got Something in My Front Pocket for You\\". Butters flatly refuses to participate in the show, even after further pressing, so the team has to settle for a dancing duck named Jeffy from a local farm. Jeffy has not danced to any songs other than those about drug use and domestic violence played by the farmer, all to extensively modified lyrics of the song \\"The Crawdad Song\\". On the day of the performance, Jeffy's ankle gets sprained during practice. The team looks likely to be forced to forfeit, as competition rules require a mandatory five members. Just in time, though, Butters suddenly arrives in his tap-dancing outfit, allowing the kids to perform. When they do, however, Butters' shoe flies off again and hits a stage light, causing the rafter to fall on and kill the entire Orange County team and their coach. Although Butters is horrified by this, the South Park team wins by default, and a bloodstained, screaming and horribly traumatized Butters is carried off and hailed as a hero. Release The episode was released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters.

In 2007, it merged with Rasmussen College and is now known as Rasmussen College. The school offers associate degrees and bachelor's degrees in several fields. Aakers was founded in Fargo in 1902 and a second location was opened in Grand Forks, North Dakota in 1905. The Fargo location was sold in 1912 and the Grand Forks location became the only Aakers for decades. In 1998, the Grand Forks location was closed and operations were again moved to Fargo. The Bismarck campus opened in 2003. Founder Hans H. Aaker, proprietor of Aaker‚Äôs Business College, was born on a farm near Ridgeway, Iowa, on the 16th day of April, 1862. His father, Hans O. Aaker, was born in Sauland, Telemarken, Norway, in 1825. He emigrated to Winneshiek county, Iowa, where he was one of the early settlers and for fifty years a prominent and well to do farmer. Ragnild Aaker (n√©e Gutehus), the mother of H. H. Aaker, was born in Hjartdal, Telemarken, Norway, and was married to Hans O. Aaker just before his emigration to this country. Young Aaker received a good primary education and entered Luther ‚Äôs College at Decorah, Iowa, where he remained nearly four years, when, coming to the conclusion that a business course would suit him better than preparation for the ministry, he entered a business college at Decorah, graduating in 1882, and from the commercial department of the Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Ind., in 1883. Mr. Aaker then assumed charge of the commercial department of the Willmar Seminary, a new school started in 1883 at Wilmar, Minn., by Prof. A. M. Hove, later a teacher at Augsburg Seminary, Minnesota; Prof. H. S. Hilleboe, now principal of the schools at Benson, Minn., and Mr. Aaker. The seminary was one of the first schools of its kind in the Northwest, and grew in five years from twelve pupils to 250. In 1888 Mr. Aaker decided to engage in business and resigned his school position and in partnership with a brother opened a mercantile house in Twin Valley, where a profitable business was carried on. In 1891 the Northwestern Lutheran College Association was incorporated and a school styled Concordia College was started at Moorhead. The record made by Prof. Aaker at the Willmar Seminary was well known and the officers of the new school were very anxious to secure his services. Finally he was induced to accept a position with this institution. In January, 1892, he assumed charge of the commercial department and two years later he was elected principal of the school. Concordia College is one of the most prosperous schools in the Northwest. In political matters he is known as a Prohibitionist, and he has taken an active part in the work of the party. While located at Twin Valley he was the party nominee for county superintendent of schools and lost by a narrow margin. In 1892 he was the Prohibition candidate for secretary of state. In the spring of 1900 the business men of Moorhead requested Professor Aaker to become a candidate for mayor. The city had been for many years the dumping ground of the drinking element of Fargo, N. D., a city across the state line, and under Prohibition laws. The resorts barred from Fargo found a place in Moorhead, and, as no relief could be obtained from the regular nominees, the business men decided upon Mr. Aaker, as the man to redeem the fair name of the city. He was elected by a plurality of eighty votes over the opposing candidates. In the spring of 1900, Mr. Aaker was nominated for congress by the Prohibitionists of the Seventh Congressional district. He was also a candidate for the nomination of the People‚Äôs party and had the support of the leading men of the party, but owing to saloon influence he was defeated for the nomination. Mr. Aaker, though defeated, ran ahead of his ticket, receiving more than double the votes cast for the nominee for governor. Mr. Aaker is a member of the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. He was married, September 5, 1900, to Miss Annette Peterson, for several years at Concordia College. He resigned his position at Concordia College, in the summer of 1902, and opened his business college in Fargo, October 27, 1902. He ran for governor on the Prohibition ticket in 1904. In 1906 he made a strong campaign against gambling and prostitution, in Fargo, as candidate for mayor on a strict enforcement platform. He is president of the Direct Legislation League, and also of the Scandinavian Republican League.

Being more expensive, engineering plastics are produced in lower quantities and tend to be used for smaller objects or low-volume applications (such as mechanical parts), rather than for bulk and high-volume ends (like containers and packaging). The term usually refers to thermoplastic materials rather than thermosetting ones. Examples of engineering plastics include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), used for car bumpers, dashboard trim and Lego bricks; polycarbonates, used in motorcycle helmets and optical discs; and polyamides (nylons), used for skis and ski boots. Engineering plastics have gradually replaced traditional engineering materials such as wood or metal in many applications. Besides equalling or surpassing them in weight/strength and other properties, engineering plastics are much easier to manufacture, especially in complicated shapes.  Relevant properties  Each engineering plastic usually has a unique combination of properties that may make it the material of choice for some application. For example, polycarbonates are highly resistant to impact, while polyamides are highly resistant to abrasion. Other properties exhibited by various grades of engineering plastics include heat resistance, mechanical strength, rigidity, chemical stability, self lubrication (specially used in manufacturing of gears & skids) and fire safety.

In the interview at the back of Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves, Matthew Reilly stated that \\"Hell Island exists as a nice side adventure for Scarecrow and Mother, and a great short book for new readers who might wish to try my work.\\" Hell Island was released in retail stores in 2007 after only being available through the Books Alive program. Plot summary Hell Island is a remote Pacific Island that no one knows about. It doesn't feature on any map. It was used by the Japanese during World War II as a remote airfield but it was soon taken over by American forces in 1943. It is currently used by the U.S. government for scientific experiments on apes. The U.S. government is using the island for Project Stormtrooper, wherein apes are being engineered in such a way that they become super-soldiers. The book opens with Schofield's ten-man Marine Recon team parachuting onto the deck of the soon-to-be- decommissioned aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, along with three other special forces teams - a Delta Force team, a squad of SEALs and a team from the 82nd Airborne Division. The Delta team make landfall on the island while the other three teams investigate the aircraft carrier. Shane Schofield realises that the carrier is being used for the specific project after the Airborne and SEAL teams are quickly slaughtered. A DARPA scientist, whom Schofield's team stumble across, explain that the enemy is a group of genetically and electronically enhanced gorillas, armed with modified M-4 Colt Commandos and extremely deadly in melee combat. The few remaining Marines kill significant numbers of the gorillas in a large battle on board the aircraft carrier, eventually departing to investigate the island. Schofield comments that the island is home to an extensive tunnel network dating from World War II, which features an uncommon self-destruct mechanism: sea doors which can flood the lower parts of the tunnel system in the event of an enemy force capturing the base. Schofield then realizes that the gorillas are somehow controlled by Captain William Buck \\"Buccaneer\\" Broyles, the former leader of what was acknowledged to be the best Marines Unit, due to the similar tactics his Marines and the gorillas employed. He realises that the apes can listen to radio chatter and so he sends out a fake distress message which lures the apes to them. They set a trap to lock the apes in an old ammunition storage bunker before detonating the munitions, but the Delta team's entrance with the rest of the DARPA team (who deactivate the gorillas' neural chips) changes the situation. A silver disc, attached to the ID of the DARPA scientists and the DELTA team, is responsible for the gorillas not hurting them. Dr. Knox, the scientist in charge of the project, tells Schofield that they are the sole survivors of a field test for the apes, which has so far killed six hundred Marines and two special forces squads. He congratulates Schofield on his success, before subtly instructing the Delta team leader to execute them. However, Mother jams the radio signals controlling the apes, causing them to turn on the scientists. The Delta team is distracted and subsequently killed by Schofield's team, leaving only Broyles. Schofield opens the sea door of the tunnel system, flooding the tunnels and drowning the gorillas along with the \\"Buccaneer\\". The story ends with Schofield's team leaving on a C-17 which was originally sent to pick up the DARPA and Delta teams along with the apes. Trivia * At the time of publication, Astro was the only character to appear in both the Scarecrow and Huntsman series, suggesting that they are both set in the same 'universe'. This was confirmed in The Four Legendary Kingdoms when Schofield and West meet for the first time. * Reilly himself recommends the US version of this book due to being less edited than other releases and also illustrated, with the illustrations reflecting how he had envisaged Hell Island while writing it.Talk given at the Library of Birmingham, Uk, 31/1/2014 References  External links  * Hell Island - Booklover Book Reviews, 2010 Category:Novels by Matthew Reilly Category:Australian novellas Category:2005 Australian novels Category:Australian horror novels Category:Australian thriller novels Category:Popular culture about the United States Marine Corps Category:Novels set in Oceania Category:Novels set on islands ","title":"Hell Island"},{"id":"2376573","text":"Mudzi East is a parliamentary constituency in Mashonaland, Zimbabwe.

The Election Commission announced that 12,499 people voted. However, 22,420 votes were registered, leaving unexplained where the extra 9,921 votes came from. Ray Kaukonde, the Zanu PF candidate, won with 17,999 votes, representing 144% of the original voters. The allegation was that ballot-box stuffing increased his original 8,078 votes.

Technically the book is one long poem divided into twelve parts, but the parts are so disparate that many critics have considered it a collection of shorter pieces rather than a lengthy whole. The book is narrated by Browning in the thinly disguised persona of the Persian soothsayer Ferishtah, who tells several parables (the titular \\"fancies\\") to students that illustrate his/Browning's opinions on a number of religious and moral topics. The Persian names and references are taken from Ferdowsi's ShƒÅhnƒÅmeh, but by and large the tales are Browning's invention. No connection was intended with the Persian historian Firishta. Browning had finished the book by late January 1884, but his publisher chose to delay its release until the end of the year so as not to compromise the sales of his recently released collection Jocoseria. Reviews were mixed, some critics opining that there was \\"too much preaching and not enough poetry\\" in the book, but sales were good, due in part to the prevailing fashion for Orientalism in England at the time. The book is nowadays considered a very minor work in the Browning canon and selections from it are rarely included in Browning anthologies.

Ferry in the harbour of Rhubodach The name Rhubodach may come from the Gaelic Rubha a‚Äô Bhodaich which translates as old man's point or promontory or alternatively may be from An Rubha Bh√≥daich meaning the Bute headland. Rhubodach lies at the north of Bute on the A886 road. From here a small ro-ro ferry sails the short distance over the Kyles of Bute to Colintraive on the Cowal peninsula in Argyll, where the A886 road continues to Strachur. The route, operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, is reputed to be one of the shortest in Scotland still in operation. The issue of whether the ferry should be replaced by a bridge is one which reappears in various discussions about Bute's economy, however opposition stems from the resulting loss of Bute's \\"island status\\". Film actor and director Lord Attenborough (29 August 1923 - 24 August 2014) owned Rhubodach estate for a number of years. In August 2009 he placed the estate up for sale. A referendum carried out on 12 February 2010 showed 93% of islanders supported a plan land to buy the land for the community.

He is notable for helping create the Japanese painting technique of Nihonga. His real name was Sakai Hidemaro. Early life Yokoyama was born in Mito city, Ibaraki Prefecture, as the eldest son of Sakai Sutehiko, an ex-samurai family in Mito clan. He was adopted into his mother's family, from whom he took the surname \\"Yokoyama\\". With his family, he moved to Tokyo in 1878. He studied at the T≈çky≈ç Furitsu Daiichi Ch≈´gakk≈ç (Hibiya High School), and was interested in the English language and in western style oil painting. This led him to study pencil drawing with a painter, Watanabe Fumisaburo. He also studied under one of the great painters of the time, Kan≈ç H≈çgai, who was the master of the Kan≈ç school. In 1889, Yokoyama enrolled in the first graduating class of the T≈çky≈ç Bijutsu Gakk≈ç (the predecessor to the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), which had just been opened by Okakura Kakuz≈ç (aka Okakura Tenshin). In school, he studied under the Kan≈ç school artist Hashimoto Gah≈ç. Several of his classmates also later became famous artists: Hishida Shuns≈ç, Shimomura Kanzan, and Saig≈ç Kogetsu. After graduation, Yokoyama spent a year teaching at \\"Ky≈çto Shiritsu Bijutsu K≈çgei Gakk≈ç\\" (the predecessor to the Kyoto City University of Arts) in Kyoto, studying Buddhist painting. Around that time, he started to use his \\"Taikan\\" pseudonym. He returned to Tokyo in 1896 as assistant professor at the T≈çky≈ç Bijutsu Gakk≈ç. He resigned that position only a year later, when his mentor, Okakura Kakuz≈ç (aka Okakura Tenshin), was forced to resign for political reasons, and joined Okakura in establishing the Japan Fine Arts Academy (Nihon Bijutsuin). After the death of his wife, Yokoyama traveled extensively overseas, visiting Calcutta, New York City, Boston, London, Berlin and Paris. Artistic career In 1914, after his ouster from the Bunten Fine Arts Exhibition sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Yokoyama concentrated on reviving the Japan Fine Arts Academy, which had closed down upon Okakura Kakuz≈ç's death in 1913. The annual exhibitions of the Japan Fine Arts Academy, which had the abbreviated name Inten, became one of the most important, non- governmental outlets for young talents. One of the chief sponsors of Taikan at this time was the silk merchant and art patron Hara Tomitar≈ç. His influence in the university was strong even in other creative fields. He brought up for example Hakuo Iriyama, educated into a lacquer artist, that developed original painting and printing techniques based on dry lacquer techniques and pigmented lacquer. Taikan was extremely influential in the evolution of the Nihonga technique, having departed from the traditional method of line drawing. Together with Hishida Shuns≈ç, he developed a new style, eliminating the lines and concentrating on soft, blurred polychromes. While Yokoyama's works tended to remain faithful in general to the traditional Rinpa school style, he experimented with various techniques borrowed from Western painting methods. However, such a cutting-edge technique was severely criticized by other traditional painters. His style, which was called \\"Mourou-tai(Blurred style)\\" (which nowadays exactly depicts his painting's character), meant the lack of energy and vitality sarcastically. He later turned almost exclusively to monochrome ink paintings, and came to be known for his mastery of the various tones and shades of black. A number of his works have been classified as Important Cultural Property by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. His trip to Calcutta in 1902 was immensely important for the evolution of global Modernism, as it resulted in a seminal exchange both of technique and motif with the important early Indian Modernist Abanindranath Tagore.Video of a Lecture discussing the importance of the Calcutta-Tokyo connection for early global Modernism, London University School of Advanced Study, March 2012. In the pre-World War II era, Taikan was sent to Italy by the Japanese government as an official representative of the Japanese artistic community. Because his teacher Okakura Tenshin was a nationalist (known as a loyal philosopher in the Meiji era as well), Taikan was very much influenced by his thoughts. Consequently, he repeatedly used Mount Fuji as a motif of his paintings, and even presented them to the Imperial family. During World War II, he donated his earnings from the sales of his paintings to the national military, and this resulted in his interrogation, accused as a suspected war criminal by GHQ. In 1935, he was appointed to the Imperial Arts Academy (the forerunner of the Japan Art Academy), and in 1937, he was one of the first people to be awarded the Order of Culture when it was established in 1937. He was also awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, first class. On 26 February 1958, Yokoyama Taikan died in Tokyo at the age of eighty-nine; his former house is now open to the public as the Yokoyama Taikan Memorial Museum. His brain is preserved in formaldehyde at the University of Tokyo Medical School.

Hjelmslev‚Äôs theory, most notably, is an early mathematical methodology for the analysis of language which was subsequently incorporated into the analytical foundation of current models of functional‚Äîstructural grammar such as Danish Functional Grammar, Functional Discourse Grammar and Systemic Functional Linguistics. Hjelmslev‚Äôs theory likewise remains fundamental for modern semiotics. Meaning Glossematics defines the glosseme as the most basic unit or component of language. The glosseme is defined as the smallest irreducible unit of both the content and expression planes of language; in the expression plane, the glosseme is nearly identical to the phoneme. In the content plane, it is the smallest unit of meaning which underlies a concept. A ewe, for example, consists of the taxemes sheep and female which may eventually be divided into even smaller units ‚Äì glossemes ‚Äì of meaning. The analysis is gradually expanded to the study of functions, more commonly known as dependencies, between elements on the level of discourse (which is called process), and between meaning and form in the linguistic system. The term glosseme was coined by Louis Hjelmslev and Hans J√∏rgen Uldall in the 1930s. It derives from the Greek word glossa (meaning here \\"language\\") and the -eme suffix. A similar idea was used by Leonard Bloomfield in describing his system of basic linguistic units (see tagmeme) although glossematics is more far-reaching in each direction. Hjelmslev‚Äôs theory of language Glossematics is an expansion of Saussure‚Äôs concept of language as a dual system of meaning and form. This is in contrast to a contemporary American tendency of placing semantics outside the core of linguistics. Hjelmslev was also influenced by the Prague Linguistic Circle to the extent that he considered full texts as the material for analysis rather than ‚Äòutterances‚Äô as was commonplace in American structuralism. Diverging from both American and European linguists, though, Hjelmslev considered language not as a social fact but as a computational system which underlies all sciences. The ultimate goal of the linguist is to gain a more perfect understanding of the whole through a thorough study of the structure of the constituent parts. To the greatest extent possible, glossematics seeks to construct a non-historical, non-sociological and non-psychological model based on language-specific principles and minimal reliance on factors external to the system. The linguist‚Äôs task, analysing texts or corpora of different languages, aims to establish a universal model of the inner workings of language by comparing the underlying meta-structures of a given language to others. Rather than separate fields of study, Hjelmslev regarded phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicology and semantics as part of the same apparatus. By ‚Äòphonetics‚Äô and ‚Äòsemantics‚Äô Hjelmslev means unorganised sound and meaning. Instead, a linguist must study expression and content, the systematised organisation of form and meaning of a given language which is to be deduced from the research material. As manifested by subsequent models of structural grammar, but also to an extent by generative grammar, units of a given level are collected into inventories (e.g. word classes, phrase types, etc.). Glossematics is then meant to become a device which can correctly predict all grammatical sentences of any language. Hjelmslev's idea later came to be associated with Noam Chomsky who made used a modification of it made by his PhD supervisor Zellig Harris. Hjelmslev's fame however continues in semiotics, and in functional linguistics where his idea is incorporated into modern grammatical models including systemic functional linguistics, functional discourse grammar, and Danish functional linguistics. Formalism versus functionalism Glossematics earned the nickname formalism or formal linguistics after the publication of Hjelmslev‚Äôs Prolegomena to a Theory of Language (Danish original published in 1943 with subsequent English and French translations). Some members of the Prague School disagreed with Hjelmslev‚Äôs use of the word function in his meaning ‚Äôdependency‚Äô or ‚Äôlink‚Äô in a chain of dependencies which is distant from the Praguian concept of the functions of language. Glossematics is a proper structuralist model in that it examines the interaction of the content level and the expression level. Nonetheless, the formalist epithet can be considered appropriate from different perspectives. For one, Hjelmslev considered linguistics as a formal science. For another, he believed that general linguistics should be the study of language as an autonomous system disregarding extralinguistic factors.

Private school math education varies between schools whereas New York has statewide public school requirements where standardized tests are used to determine if the teaching method and educator are effective in transmitting content to the students. While an individual private school can choose the content and educational method to use, New York State mandates content and methods statewide. Some public schools have and continue to use established methods, such as Montessori for teaching such required content. New York State has used various foci of content and methods of teaching math including New Math (1960s), 'back to the basics' (1970s), Whole Math (1990s), Integrated Math, and Everyday Mathematics. How to teach math, what to teach, and its effectiveness has been a topic of debate in New York State and nationally since the \\"Math Wars\\" started in the 1960s. Often, current political events influence how and what is taught. The politics in turn influence state legislation. California, New York, and several other states have influenced textbook content produced by publishers.http://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/AHistory.html In the United States, the state of New York has implemented a novel curriculum for high school mathematics. The courses Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II/Trigonometry are required courses mandated by the New York State Department of Education for high school graduation. 2007-present =Algebra= This is the first course in the new three-year curriculum. It was originally \\"Math A,\\" but was replaced with \\"Integrated Algebra.\\" In 2009 when Common Core was adopted, \\"Algebra I\\" replaced \\"Integrated Algebra\\" and is still in use today. Students learn to how write, solve, and graph equations and inequalities. They will also learn how to solve systems of equations, as well as how to simplify exponents, quadratic equations, exponential functions, polynomials, radicals, and rational expressions. Other topics included are probability and statistics. Some schools divided Algebra 1 into a two-year sequence. The students who receive it begin with Algebra 1A, and will cover the rest of the Algebra 1 topics in Algebra 1B in the next school year. Typically, most students are placed in Algebra 1 which covers all lessons rather than splitting them. At the conclusion of the one-year course, students take the New York State Regents Exam. The first administration of this exam was in June 2008. =Geometry= This is the second course in the new three year curriculum. It replaced part of \\"Math A\\" and part of \\"Math B\\" Geometric concepts such as right triangles are introduced. The course also covers topics including perpendicular and parallel lines, triangles, quadrilaterals, and transformations. At the conclusion of this one-year course, students take a New York State Regents exam in Geometry. The first administration of this exam was in June 2009. =Algebra II= This is the third and last course of the new three-year curriculum. It replaced the elements of \\"Math B\\" not covered in geometry. This course covers concepts of advanced algebra, and as well prepares students for pre-calculus and calculus. In 2016, the Board of Regents removed some of the trigonometry concepts and lessons from the course, and the Regents exam has been renamed from \\"Algebra 2/Trigonometry\\" to \\"Algebra II\\". At the conclusion of the one-year course, students take the New York State Regents exam for Algebra II. This is the last Regents exam in mathematics students could take. Like the former \\"Math B\\" Regents, it is considered one of the hardest High School Regents examinations, along with the Physical Setting/Chemistry regents and the Physical Setting/Physics regents. The Algebra 2/Trigonometry exam was given from June 2010 through January 2017 and the new Algebra II Exam has been given since June 2016. 2001-2009 =Math A (former course)= Math A replaced the former \\"Course 1\\" curriculum which focused solely on the topic of algebra, while Math A covered a whole range of topics. After algebra, you take Geometry in the 10th grade and than Algebra II in the 11th grade. In Math A, students learn to how write, solve, and graph equations and inequalities. They will also learn how to solve systems of equations, quadratics, as well as exponents, exponential functions, polynomials, radicals, and rational expressions. Other topics included are probability and statistics. Geometric concepts such as right triangles are also introduced. The course works in conjunction with New York State's Standards for Mathematics. One course lasted three semesters, after which students took the Regents Math A Examination. =Math A/B (former course)= Math A/B took the place of the former \\"Course 2\\" curriculum, which focused almost solely on geometry, while Math A/B focused on a whole range of topics. Math A/B served as a bridge between the Math A and Math B courses. Math A/B stayed true to its geometric roots, as the first half of the course covered topics such as perpendicular and parallel lines, triangles, quadrilaterals, and transformations. After their first semester, students took the New York State Math A Regents exam. June 2008 was the last administration of this exam. For the second half of the year, students would begin Math B. They covered logic, geometric figures, and an introduction to trigonometry. =Math B (former course)= Math B was required to receive a High School Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. The course replaces the former \\"Course 3\\" curriculum, which focused almost solely on trigonometry. Math B focused on a whole range of topics. It was taken after the student has completed and passed Math A. A Regents exam was taken at the end of the -year course. The Math B Regents was often considered one of the most difficult New York State Regents. Math B covered concepts that can be found in trigonometry and advanced algebra, and prepared students for pre-calculus and calculus and reviewed past topics. During their year of study, students learned different theorems, graphed complex numbers and vectors, as well as reviewed topics such as exponential functions, systems of inequalities, and radicals. As the year progressed, students were expected to relate these functions to the real world, create conjectures through their own research, and begin a classroom discussion about these topics. At the end of their studies, they would take the New York State Math B Regents Examination. The last administration of this exam was in August 2010. =Changes proposed in 2004= In November 2004, the Mathematics Standards Committee made a report to the Board of Regents about the State's requirements for high school graduation as related to mathematics. The committee recommended that: *The curriculum should return to its old format as a one-year course with a Regents exam taken at the end of the year, with the new exam to be administered no earlier than June 2007. Math A would have its name changed to Integrated Algebra. *In addition to the current Regents exam at the end of the Math B course, there should be another Regents exam, at the end of the first half of Math B study (currently Math A/B), to be administered no later than June 2006, bringing the total number of Regents exams to three. *The course's name should be changed to Geometry for the first half of the course, and Algebra II and Trigonometry for the second half of the course (currently Math B). Integrated is only used in the new Algebra course. **The State of New York has announced that these changes will be implemented in the 2009/10 scholastic year. *In 2009, Integrated Algebra was switched to Algebra 1, due to the common core adoption. The move was praised by many who thought the changes to the original draft curriculum were unnecessary. Pre-2002 =Sequential Mathematics= Prior to the 2001-2002 school year, the New York State Board of Regents mandated a three-year Sequential Mathematics series divided into three Courses I, II, and III.

It is situated in Noordwijk, South Holland, in the western Netherlands, although several kilometers off the village but immediately linked to the most Northern district of the nearby town Katwijk. At ESTEC, about 2500 engineers, technicians and scientists work hands-on with mission design, spacecraft and space technology. ESTEC provides extensive testing facilities to verify the proper operation of spacecraft, such as the Large Space Simulator (LSS), acoustic and electromagnetic testing bays, multi-axis vibration tables and the ESA Propulsion Laboratory (EPL). Prior to launch, almost all of the equipment that ESA launches is tested in some degree at ESTEC. The Space Expo is ESTEC's visitors centre. It has a permanent exhibition about space exploration.  Activities  * Future mission assessment * Current project support * Test Center * Operations  History  EDM Schiaparelli and the ExoMars Rover at ESTEC, 2014 The European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) was founded in 1968. The centre was to be the core of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO). Its responsibilities included the engineering and testing of satellites and their payloads, the integration of scientific instruments in these payloads, and making arrangements for their launch. In some cases member states were to produce the scientific instruments for ESRO or produce them as part of their own national effort and compensate ESTEC for its service. In practice, national organisations simply used ESTEC as a service organisation and left it to pay for their efforts from the ESRO budget. After the Bannier Report the facility gained overall executive authority for spacecraft development and was merged with ESLAB. The satellite control centre was also moved to ESOC. ESTEC was originally to be located in Delft (South Holland) but because of unforeseen difficulties, Noordwijk was chosen instead.  ESA Test Centre  MetOp-C's payload module being lowered into Large Space Simulator, 2017 In 1964 the ESRO decided to create an independent test centre that would be part of ESTEC. The first building with vibration and thermal vacuum facilities (named F-building) was completed in 1966 and the first satellite to be tested was the ESRO-1 satellite in 1968. From the 1970s to the late 1980s the test centre was enlarged by following facilities: The Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC) in 1975, The Multishaker in 1983, The EMC facility in 1985, The Large Space simulator (by extending the DTC) in 1986, The Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) in 1989 and the Compact Payload Test Range (CPTR) in 1990. In the 1990s and 2000s the following major facilities have been added: The hydraulic shaker system (HYDRA), The Fr building with additional clean rooms (2000), The Large EMC facility (Maxwell) and the QUAD Shaker in 2008. In 1997 the test operations and facilities maintenance activities were subcontracted to the COMET consortium and in the year 2000 the test management, maintenance, operations and marketing of the test centre has been taken over by European Test Services B.V. (a subsidiary of IABG mbH and Intespace SA); The facilities are still belonging to ESA which is responsible for the facility development, test methodologies, test related engineering and subcontractor control. Since the year 2000 not only tests for space industry have been performed but the facilities are also used for aerospace-, railway-, transport-, marine- and power- testing for customers like ABB, ALSTOM, Airbus, Bombardier and many more.  Space Expo  Space Expo in 2013 The Space Expo is the permanent exhibition about space exploration at the ESTEC compound in Noordwijk.

The land where the village lies is said to have been granted by William the Lion to Calum Cormack in 1169, who gave the church, with the tithes and other property belonging to it, to the monks of Kelso, in whose possession it remained till a short time prior to the accession of Robert Bruce. The land subsequently became the property of a younger branch of the Maxwell family, who granted the advowson and tithes to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey, who held them until the Reformation. The Tyne Water divides the village into Easter Pencaitland and Wester Pencaitland, crossed by a three-arched bridge dating from the 16th Century. An ancient cross in Wester Pencaitland indicates that there would probably have been a market there. A large industrial maltings, which was built in 1965, is situated just before the entrance to the village at Wester Pencaitland. Etymology The name \\"Pencaitland\\" may derive from the Old Brythonic meaning \\"Head of the Woodland\\" Pencaitland Community Council Pencaitland Community Council meets 10 times throughout the year, typically on the last Wednesday of the month at the Trevelyan Hall in Wester Pencaitland. The Community Council is constituted from fifteen members of the local population along with the locally elected representatives of the Fa'side catchment. This catchment extends to New Winton and Boggs Holdings to the north and Peastonbank to the south. Winton House Winton House, Pencaitland, west front Winton House, Pencaitland from NE (showing original tower-house on left) The Winton Arms, Pencaitland northwest of Pencaitland is Winton House, the original square Tower house being built in the 15th century on land granted to the Setons by David I c1152, and mentioned in a charter to them from William the Lion in 1169. It was burnt by the Earl of Hertford's forces during the Rough Wooing, and subsequently repaired, restored, and later enlarged by George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton, commencing in 1619. Architecturally, Winton is one of the most important houses in Scotland, due largely to the work of William Wallace, who was appointed the King's Master Mason in 1617.McWilliam, Colin, The Buildings of Scotland - Lothian, except Edinburgh, London, 1978, p.472-4, This \\"peculiar and beautiful structure\\",Billings, Robert; Burton, John, The Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland, Edinburgh, Oliver & Boyd (1901) is situated on a steep embankment sloping down to the valley of the Tyne. Hunnewell (The Lands of Scott) says: \\"this Jacobean mansion was that of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor. There is, of course, a ghost-room in the upper part of the house; but I saw nothing uncanny about it, twice that I was there.\\" In 1630, Lord Winton had completed half of the house, beginning at Wallace‚Äôs Tower, which had been burned, and continuing as far as Jacob‚Äôs Tower. Another room, called the King‚Äôs Chamber, is said to have been occupied by Charles I when he came to Scotland to be crowned in 1633, although most records have him staying at Seton Palace. Thinking that better times were now at hand, the Earl of Winton caused to be carved on a fine stone tablet upon the frontispiece of his new building a crown supported by a thistle between two roses, signifying the union of Scotland and England. Under it he caused to be inscribed in deep letters of gold this Latin verse: Unio Nune Stoque Cadoque Tuis. Mylne makes a note upon this, saying: \\"Ye Union was ye cause of the families' ruin\\". The Wintons' tenure lasted until 1715 when George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton engaged in supporting the Jacobites. He was captured and taken to the Tower of London, and ultimately forfeited his land. The Earl's capture ended an era when kings were entertained and master craftsmen were engaged fresh from Edinburgh Castle to embellish Winton House in the style of the Scottish Renaissance. In the absence of the Earl but in his name, Winton was requisitioned by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 when his rebel army camped on the Winton estate. Winton is now the family home of Sir Francis and Lady Ogilvy. Fountainhall south-west of Pencaitland is Fountainhall, a late 16th-century mansion extended in the early 17th century on the same intimate scale and with the same materials, fine-grained harlings matching the pale yellow sandstone of the chimneys, crowstep gables, and other dressings. The estate's original name was Woodhead, and was purchased by John Pringle in 1635 who carried out extensive alterations and enhancements. On 13 August 1681 the estate was purchased by John Lauder of Newington, a rich Baillie of Edinburgh, for whom the house and lands were erected into the feudal barony of Fountainhall, becoming the seat of that family. Tradition states that the part of the property to the east contained a courtroom for the barony. Most of the internal finishings are the work of the Lauders from the early 18th century, with much panelling and plaster cornices. After the Lauders finally parted with Fountainhall in the 1920s, the removal of a lath-and-plaster wall revealed a tapestry in situ, dating from about 1700. There is a 17th-century walled garden adjoining the east of the house, and to the south of the house is a ruined 17th century dovecote, later imitated by the erection of another, identical, nearby. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland suggests that the two buildings flanked an 18th-century pedestrian access to the house.McWilliam, Colin, The Buildings of Scotland - Lothian, except Edinburgh, London, 1978, p.205-6, Professor John (Ian) Holbourn bought Fountainhall in 1922 and renamed the house Pencait Castle. Professor Holbourn, who was a survivor of the Lusitania sinking in 1916, was the owner and laird of Foula in the Shetland Islands. The house was sold after the death of his wife, Marion, in the 1950s.Ian Stoughton Holbourn : The Lusitania Resource In 1956, Mr. and Mrs. Ian and Trudy Cowe bought the house, returning the name to Fountainhall. In 1988, the house came into the hands of their son Robert and his wife Alison in whose possession the house remains. (2009)East Lothian Antiquarian SocietyEast Lothian Life. issue 62. 'Fountainhall, a hidden treasure' by James Denham. Church thumb James, Lord Ruthven 1777-1853, Pencaitland The Pencaitland parish Church of Scotland, at Easter Pencaitland, is apparently of the 16th or early 17th century, but probably standing on medieval foundations. The west tower contains the Saltoun aisle, formerly entered through a fine mid-seventeenth century door in the west wall; and there is a chapel at the northern end. Immediately east of the Saltoun aisle is a two-bay chapel, said by some to date from the 13th century. The west tower is square for most of its height, but at the top it contains an octagonal belfry and dovecote. The building has a pointed slated spire dating from 1631. Over the centuries the building has been much altered. The front row of pews in the Saltoun aisle are of Dutch character in oak, c.1600. The organ was installed in 1889.McWilliam, Colin, The Buildings of Scotland - Lothian, except Edinburgh, London, 1978, p.376-7, Former Ministers include David Calderwood (1575-1650) and Robert Douglas (1594-1674), one time leader of Scotland's moderate Presbyterians. On the west wall a Renaissance tablet to Katherine Forbes, daughter of the Rev. John Forbes, Minister to the English Merchant-Adventurers at Delft gives a year of death of 1639. She was the wife of a Pencaitland minister, John Oswald, whose initials are carved over the west door. In the churchyard is an Iona cross to James, Sixth Lord Ruthven (1777-1853). The manse, to the south of the church, was erected in the early 19th century in a 'pretty Gothic' style with canted bays. District The Pencaitland to Ormiston railway walk follows the course of the Edinburgh - Gifford branch railway line, originally built by the Gifford and Garvald Light Railway Company in 1901, which was closed in 1965. Pencaitland is also the location of recording studio Castle Sound Studios, founded by producer Calum Malcolm in 1979 and sited in a building which formerly housed Pencaitland Primary School until it moved to an area known as The Glebe in the 1970s. The band Orange Juice recorded their first two singles for the Postcard Records label at Castle Sound. Simple Minds, Runrig, REM, Martyn Bennett and The Blue Nile have also recorded there. Located a short distance from the village is Glenkinchie distillery, which produces Scotch whisky, marketed by Diageo as part of their Classic Malts range. Tyneholm House is a Category B listed mansion house designed by William Burn in 1835 for Patrick Dudgeon. The house was later a seat of a branch of the Trevelyan family. It became a Dr Barnardo's Children's Home in the mid-twentieth century and in the 1980s a nursing home. Now in use again as a private home. The Trevelyan Hall in Wester Pencaitland was erected in 1883 by Mrs. Trevelyan of Tyneholm at a cost of over ¬£1200, in memory of her husband, Arthur Trevelyan, who died in 1880, 2nd son of Sir John Trevelyan of Wallington Hall in Northumberland. It is classified by Historic Environment Scotland as a category C listed building. A SPAR shop and petrol station are now located nearby and there is a small newsagent's, known locally as \\"The Granny Shop\\", on the main road in Easter Pencaitland. The only public house in the village is called \\"The Winton Arms\\". A restaurant called \\"The Old Smiddy\\" used to be sited along the main road near the old school but it has now been converted into flats. Newer housing areas have been built over the last twenty years; to the east side of Pencaitland, Vinefields, Limekilns and Spilmersford View, which are located near to the football pitch on the Gifford road, and The Green in Easter Pencaitland. Pencaitland receives a mention in Shaun Keaveny's book \\"R2D2 Lives in Preston\\" (2010). Transport The nearest railway station is in Longniddry. There is a half-hourly Abellio ScotRail service to and from North Berwick and Edinburgh Waverley. East Coast Buses is the main bus operator in the village. Service 113 provides a half hourlyhttps://eastcoastbuses.co.uk/r113/ service into Edinburgh city centre via the nearby towns of Tranent and Musselburgh, seven days a week.

Historian Nitish Sengupta describes the Bengal Renaissance as taking place from Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772‚Äì1833) through Rabindranath Tagore (1861‚Äì1941).https://www.ukessays.com/essays/history/bengal-renaissance-and- the-19th-century-history-essay.php According to historian Sumit Sarkar, 19th century Bengali religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists were revered and regarded with nostalgia in the early and mid 20th century. In the early 1970s, however, a more critical view emerged.  Background  The renaissance period after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 saw a magnificent outburst of Bengali literature. While Ram Mohan Roy and Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar were the pioneers, others like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee widened it and built upon it. The Tagore family, including Rabindranath Tagore, were leaders of this period and had a particular interest in educational reform.Kathleen M. O'Connell, \\"Rabindranath Tagore on Education\\", infed.org Their contribution to the Bengal Renaissance was multi-faceted. Several members of the family, including Rabindranath, Abanindranath, Gaganendranath and Jyotirindranath Tagore, Asit Kumar Haldar and Jnanadanandini Devi have been associated with the movement.Deb, Chitra, pp 64-65. According to Nitish Sengupta, though the Bengal Renaissance was the \\"culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the Bengali people that had started in the age of Hussein Shah, it remained predominantly Hindu and only partially Muslim. There were, nevertheless, examples of Muslim intellectuals such as Syed Ameer Ali, Mosharraf Hussain. Science During the Bengal Renaissance science was also advanced by several Bengali scientists such as Satyendra Nath Bose, Anil Kumar Gain, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, Prafulla Chandra Ray, Debendra Mohan Bose, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Jnan Chandra Ghosh, Gopal Chandra Bhattacharya, Kishori Mohan Bandyopadhyay, Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee, Sisir Kumar Mitra, Upendranath Brahmachari and Meghnad Saha.

Arts  Satyajit Ray The Bengal School of Art was an art movement and a style of Indian painting that originated in Bengal and flourished throughout British India in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with Indian nationalism (swadeshi) and led by Abanindranath Tagore. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havell attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore. Literature According to historian Romesh Chunder Dutt: File:Rabindranath_Tagore_in_1909.jpgRabindranath Tagore was a poet and artist.

In 1995 he established Studio Olafur Eliasson in Berlin, a laboratory for spatial research. Olafur represented Denmark at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003 and later that year installed The Weather Project in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, London. Olafur has engaged in a number of projects in public space, including the intervention Green river, carried out in various cities between 1998 and 2001; the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion 2007, London, a temporary pavilion designed with the Norwegian architect Kjetil Tr√¶dal Thorsen; and The New York City Waterfalls, commissioned by Public Art Fund in 2008. He also created the Breakthrough Prize trophy. Like much of his work, the sculpture explores the common ground between art and science. It is molded into the shape of a toroid, recalling natural forms found from black holes and galaxies to seashells and coils of DNA. Olafur was a professor at the Berlin University of the Arts from 2009 to 2014 and is an adjunct professor at the Alle School of Fine Arts and Design in Addis Ababa since 2014.

His father, then an artist, moved back to Iceland, where their family spent summers and holidays. At 15 he had his first solo show, exhibiting landscape drawings and gouaches at a small alternative gallery in Denmark. However, Olafur considered his \\"break-dancing\\" during the mid-1980s to be his first artworks.Joachim Bessing, \\"Experiencing Space,\\" 032c issue 8 (Winter 2004/05). With two school friends, he formed a group, calling themselves the Harlem Gun Crew, and they performed at clubs and dance halls for four years, eventually winning the Scandinavian championship. Olafur studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1989 to 1995. In 1990, when he was awarded a travel budget by the Royal Danish Academy, Olafur went to New York where he started working as a studio assistant for artist Christian Eckart in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and reading texts on phenomenology and Gestalt psychology.Christopher Bagley (July 2007), From the Archives: Olafur Twist W. = Artistic career = Olafur received his degree from the academy in 1995, after having moved in 1993 to Cologne for a year, and then to Berlin, where he has since maintained a studio.Peter Schjeldahl (28 April 2008), Uncluttered. An Olafur Eliasson retrospective. The New Yorker. First located in a three-story former train depot right next door to the Hamburger Bahnhof, the studio moved to a former brewery in Prenzlauer Berg in 2008. In 1996, Olafur started working with Einar Thorsteinn, an architect and geometry expert 25 years his senior as well as a former friend of Buckminster Fuller.Michael Kimmelman (March 21, 2004), The Sun Sets at the Tate Modern New York Times. The first piece they created called 8900054, was a stainless-steel dome wide and high, designed to be seen as if it were growing from the ground. Though the effect is an illusion, the mind has a hard time believing that the structure is not part of a much grander one developing from deep below the surface. Thorsteinn's knowledge of geometry and space has been integrated into Olafur's artistic production, often seen in his geometric lamp works as well as his pavilions, tunnels and camera obscura projects. For many projects, the artist works collaboratively with specialists in various fields, among them the architects Thorsteinn and Sebastian Behmann (both of whom have been frequent collaborators, Behmann working on the Kirk Kapital headquarters on Vejle Fjord in Denmark, completed in 2018), author Svend √Öge Madsen (The Blind Pavilion), landscape architect Gunther Vogt (The Mediated Motion), architecture theorist Cedric Price (Chaque matin je me sens diff√©rent, chaque soir je me sens le m√™me), and architect Kjetil Thorsen (Serpentine Gallery Pavilion, 2007). Studio Olafur Eliasson, which the artist founded as a \\"laboratory for spatial research\\", employs a team of architects, engineers, craftsmen, and assistants (some 30 members as of 2008) who work together to conceive and construct artworks such as installations and sculptures, as well as large-scale projects and commissions.City of New York (January 15, 2008). \\"Mayor Bloomberg and Public Art Fund Announce Major Public Art Project by Artist Olafur Eliasson\\" [press release], section \\"About the Artist\\". Retrieved 2016-07-16. As professor at the Berlin University of the Arts, Olafur Eliasson founded the Institute for Spatial Experiments (Institut f√ºr Raumexperimente, IfREX), which opened within his studio building in April 2009.  Selected works and projects  = Ventilator pieces = Early works by Olafur consist of oscillating electric fans hanging from the ceiling. Ventilator (1997) swings back and forth and around, rotating on its axis.Lauren Weinberg (11 May 2009), Olafur Eliasson Time Out Chicago. Quadrible light ventilator mobile (2002‚Äì2007) is a rotating electrically powered mobile comprising a searchlight and four fans blowing air around the exhibition room and scanning it with the light cone.Olafur Eliasson: Quadrible light ventilator mobile (2002‚Äì07) Arken Museum of Modern Art. = The weather project = The weather project at Tate modern The weather project was installed at the London's Tate Modern in 2003 as part of the popular Unilever series. The installation filled the open space of the gallery's Turbine Hall. Olafur used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water, as well as a semicircular disc (reflected by the ceiling mirror to appear circular)http://telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3606332/A-terrifying-beauty.html made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge mirror, in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of orange light symbolizing the sun. Many visitors responded to this exhibition by lying on their backs and waving their hands and legs. Art critic Brian O'Doherty described this as viewers \\"intoxicated with their own narcissism as they ponder themselves elevated into the sky.\\" Open for six months, the work reportedly attracted two million visitors, many of whom were repeat visitors.Cynthia Zarin (13 November 2006), Seeing Things. The art of Olafur Eliasson New Yorker. O'Doherty was positive about the piece when talking to Frieze magazine in 2003, saying that it was \\"the first time I've seen the enormously dismal space‚Äîlike a coffin for a giant‚Äîsocialized in an effective way.\\"\\"Public Spectacle: Mark Godfrey and Rosie Bennett talk to Brian O'Doherty,\\" Frieze, issue 80, Jan./Feb. 2004, p. 56. = Light installations = Olafur has been developing various experiments with atmospheric density in exhibition spaces. In Room For One Colour (1998), a corridor lit by yellow monofrequency tubes, the participants find themselves in a room filled with light that affects the perception of all other colours. Another installation, 360 degrees Room For All Colours (2002), is a round light-sculpture where participants lose their sense of space and perspective, and experience being subsumed by an intense light.√ìlafur Eliasson: Colour memory and other informal shadows, January 24 ‚Äì May 2, 2004 Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art. Olafur's later installation Din blinde passager (Your blind passenger) (2010), commissioned by the Arken Museum of Modern Art, is a 90-metre-long tunnel. Entering the tunnel, the visitor is surrounded by dense fog. With visibility at just 1.5 metres, museumgoers have to use senses other than sight to orient themselves in relation to their surroundings.Olafur Eliasson ‚Äì Din blinde passager at ARKEN Arken Museum of Modern Art. For Feelings are facts, the first time Olafur has worked with Chinese architect Yansong Ma as well as his first exhibition in China, Olafur introduces condensed banks of artificially produced fog into the gallery of Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing. Hundreds of fluorescent lights are installed in the ceiling as a grid of red, green, and blue zones. = Green River = In 1998, Olafur discovered that uranin, a readily available nontoxic powder used to trace leaks in plumbing systems, could dye entire rivers a sickly fluorescent green. Olafur conducted a test run in the Spree River during the 1998 Berlin Biennale, scattering a handful of powder from a bridge near Museum Island. He began introducing the environmentally safe dye to rivers in Moss, Norway (1998), Bremen (1998), Los Angeles (1999), Stockholm (2000) and Tokyo (2001) ‚Äî always without advance warning. = Iceland photographs = In regular intervals, Olafur presents grids of various color photographs, all taken in Iceland. Each group of images focuses on a single subject: volcanoes, hot springs and huts isolated in the wilderness.Roberta Smith (November 15, 2012), Art in Review; Olafur Eliasson: ‚ÄòVolcanoes and shelters‚Äô New York Times. In his very first series he attempted to shoot all of Iceland‚Äôs bridges. A later series from 1996 documented the aftermath of a volcanic eruption under the Vatnaj√∂kull. Often these photographs are shot from the air, in a small rented plane traditionally used by mapmakers. Arranged in a grid, the photographs recall the repetitive images of the German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher. = Your black horizon = This project, a light installation commissioned for the Venice Biennale by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary in collaboration with British architect David Adjaye, was shown from 1 August to 31 October 2005 on the island of San Lazzaro in the lagoon near Venice, Italy. A temporary pavilion was constructed on the grounds of the monastery to house the exhibit, consisting of a square room painted black with one source of illumination ‚Äì a thin, continuous line of light set into all four walls of the room at the viewers eye-level, serving as a horizontal division between above and below. From June 2007 through October 2008, the pavilion was reopened on the island of Lopud, Croatia near the city of Dubrovnik. = Your mobile expectations: BMW H2R project = Olafur was commissioned by BMW in 2007 to create the sixteenth art car for the BMW Art Car Project. Based on the hydrogen-powered BMW H2R concept vehicle, Olafur and his team removed the automobile's alloy body and instead replaced it with a new interlocking framework of reflective steel bars and mesh. Layers of ice were created by spraying approximately 530 gallons of water during a period of several days upon the structure. On display, the frozen sculpture is glowing from within. Your mobile expectations: BMW H2R project was on special display in a temperature controlled room at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from 2007 to 2008Olafur Eliasson: Your Tempo, September 8, 2007 ‚Äì January 13, 2008 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. and at the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, in 2008. = The New York City Waterfalls = Waterfall under the Brooklyn Bridge. The bridge in the background is the Manhattan Bridge. Olafur was commissioned by The Public Art Fund to create four man-made waterfalls, called The New York City Waterfalls, ranging in a height from 90‚Äì120 ft., in New York Harbor. The installation ran from 26 June through 13 October 2008. At $15.5 million, it was the most expensive public arts project since Christo and Jeanne-Claude's installation of The Gates in Central Park. = The Parliament of Reality = Dedicated on 15 May 2009, this permanent sculpture stands at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY. The installation is based on the original Icelandic parliament, Althingi, one of the world's earliest democratic forums. The artist envisions the project as a place where students and visitors can gather to relax, discuss ideas, or have an argument. The parliament of reality emphasizes that negotiation should be the core of any educational scheme. The man-made island is surrounded by a 30-foot circular lake, 24 trees, and wild grasses. The island is composed of a cut- bluestone, compass-like floor pattern (based upon meridian lines and navigational charts), on top of which 30 river-washed boulders create an outdoor seating area for students and the public to gather. The island is reached by a 20-foot-long stainless steel lattice-canopied bridge, creating the effect that visitors are entering a stage or outdoor forum. Frogs gather in this wiry mesh at night, creating an enjoyable symphony. = Colour experiment paintings (2009‚Äì) = For his ongoing series of Colour experiment paintings ‚Äì which began in 2009 ‚Äì Olafur started analyzing pigments, paint production and application of colour in order to mix paint in the exact colour for each nanometre of the visible light spectrum. In 2014, Olafur analyzed seven paintings by J. M. W. Turner to create Turner colour experiments, which isolate and record Turner‚Äôs use of light and colour.Olafur Eliasson: Turner colour experiments, 26 August 2014 ‚Äì 25 January 2015 Tate Britain, London. = Harpa = Olafur designed the facade of Harpa, Reykjav√≠k's new concert hall and conference centre which was completed in 2011. In close collaboration with his studio team and Henning Larsen Architects, the designers of the building, Olafur has designed a unique facade consisting of large quasi bricks, a stackable twelve sided module in steel and glass. The facade will reflect the city life and the different light composed by the movements of the sun and varying weather. During the night the glass bricks are lit up by different colored LED lights. The building was opened on 13 May 2011. = Your rainbow panorama = ARoS Art Museum in Aarhus, Denmark. Olafur's artwork Your rainbow panorama consists of a circular, long and wide corridor made of glass in every color of the spectrum. It has a diameter of and is mounted on high columns on top of the roof of the ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum in Aarhus. It opened in May 2011. Visitors can walk through the corridor and have a panoramic view of the city. Construction cost 60 million Danish kroner and was funded by the Realdania foundation. Olafur's idea was chosen in 2007 among five other proposals in a bidding process by a panel of judges. At night the artwork is lit from the inside by spotlights in the floor. = Moon = In November 2013, at the Falling Walls Conference, Olafur presented with Ai Weiwei, connected via web from Beijing, their collaboration Moon, an open digital platform that allows users to draw on enormous replica of the moon via their web browser. The platform is a statement in support of freedom of speech and creative collaboration. =Contact= From December 17, 2014 to February 23, 2015, Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris. The artworks appear as a sequence of events along a journey. Moving through passageways and expansive installations, visitors become part of a choreography of darkness, light, geometry, and reflections. Along the way, optical devices, models, and a meteorite reflect Olafur‚Äôs on-going investigations into the mechanisms of perception and the construction of space. = Other projects = In 2005, Olafur and classical violin maker Hans Johannsson began work on the development of a new instrument, with the objective to reinterpret the traditions of 17th- and 18th-century violin making using today‚Äôs technology and a contemporary visual aesthetic.Alice Rawsthorn (December 9, 2007), Next Violin, The New York Times Magazine. Commissioned by Louis Vuitton in 2006, lamps titled Eye See You were installed in the Christmas windows of Louis Vuitton stores; a lamp titled You See Me went on permanent display at Louis Vuitton Fifth Avenue, New York. Each deliberately low-tech apparatus, of which there are about 400, is composed of a monofrequency light source and a parabolic mirror.Alix Browne (November 5, 2006), An I for an Eye New York Times Magazine. All fees from the project were donated to 121Ethiopia.org, a charitable foundation initially established by Olafur and his wife to renovate an orphanage. In 2007, Olafur developed the stage design for Phaedra, an opera production at the Berlin State Opera. Along with James Corner's landscape architecture firm Field Operations and architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Olafur was part of the design team for New York's High Line park.Design Team High Line. Olafur was originally supposed to create an outdoor-based artwork for the 2012 Summer Olympics; however, his proposed ¬£1 million ($1.6 million) project Take A Deep Breath ‚Äì which involved recording people breathingRoslyn Sulcas (July 12, 2012), Olafur Eliasson Brings Sunlight Back to Tate Modern New York Times. ‚Äì was rejected due to funding problems.Olafur Eliasson art project rejected by Olympics bosses BBC, 11 April 2012. In 2012 Olafur and engineer Frederik Ottesen founded Little Sun, a company that produces solar powered LED lamps. It was reported in October 2019 that Eliasson was commissioned by the German government to create a \\"pan-European work of art\\" for the German European Council presidency in the second half of 2020. Olafur's AR Wunderkammer project, available through an app, is being used to place objects in the user's environment. These objects include burning suns, extraterrestrial rocks, and rare animals.  Exhibitions  Olafur had his first solo show was with Nicolaus Schafhausen in Cologne in 1993, before moving to Berlin in 1994. In 1996, Olafur had his first show in the United States at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) organized Olafur's first major survey in the United States Take Your Time: Olafur Eliasson, from September 2007 to February 2008. Curated by the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Madeleine Grynsztejn (then Elise S. Haas Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at SFMOMA), in close collaboration with the artist, the major survey spanned the artist's career from 1993 and 2007. The exhibit included site-specific installations, large-scale immersive environments, freestanding sculpture, photography, and special commissions seen through a succession of interconnected rooms and corridors. The museum's skylight bridge was turned into an installation titled One-way colour tunnel. Following its San Francisco debut, the exhibit embarked on an international tour to the Museum of Modern Art, and P.S.1. Contemporary Art Center, New York, 2008; the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas, 2008‚Äì2009; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 2009; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney 2009‚Äì2010.

His name written in kanji can vary, in the Nihon Shoki it is spelled Êó•Êú¨Ê≠¶Â∞ä and in the Kojiki it is ÂÄ≠Âª∫ÂëΩ. The story of his life and death are told principally in the Japanese chronicles Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), but also mentioned in Kogo Sh≈´i (807) and some histories like the (721). One of his sons became Emperor Ch≈´ai, the 14th Emperor of Japan. His history is uncertain but based on the chronicles his life can be calculated. He was born circa 72 and died in 114. Details are different between the two books, and the version in Kojiki is assumed to be loyal to the older form of this legend. Legendary narrative Yoshitoshi, 1886. Yamato Takeru attacking the Kumaso leader. Prince Takeru slew his elder brother . His father, the emperor Keik≈ç, feared his brutal temperament. To keep him at a distance, the father sent him to Izumo Province, today the eastern part of Shimane Prefecture, and then the land of Kumaso, today Kumamoto Prefecture. However, Takeru succeeded in defeating his enemies, in the latter case by cross-dressing as a maid attendant at a drinking party. One of the enemies he defeated praised him and gave him the title Yamato Takeru, meaning The Brave of Yamato. But Emperor Keik≈ç's mind was unchanged. Keik≈ç sent Yamato Takeru to the eastern land whose people disobeyed the imperial court. Yamato Takeru met his aunt Princess Yamato-hime, the highest priestess of Amaterasu at Ise Grand Shrine (in Ise Province) and grieved, \\"my father wishes I would die?\\" Princess Yamatohime-no-mikoto showed him compassion and lent him a holy sword named Ame no Murakumo no tsurugi (Kusanagi no tsurugi), which Susanoo, the brother god of Amaterasu, found in the body of the eight-headed great serpent, Yamata no Orochi. Yamato Takeru went to the eastern land. He lost his wife Oto tachibana-hime during a storm when she sacrificed herself to soothe the anger of the sea god. He defeated many enemies in the eastern land, and legend has it that he and a local old man composed the first sed≈çka in Kai Province with Mount Tsukuba (now in Ibaraki Prefecture) as its theme. On his return he blasphemed a local god of Mount Ibuki, which sits on the border of ≈åmi Province and Mino Province. The god cursed him with disease and he fell ill. The story above is found in the Kojiki. In the Nihonshoki version, the father and Yamato Takeru keep a good relation. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the 43rd year of Emperor Keiko's reign (ÊôØË°åÂ§©Áöá43Âπ¥).Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1953) Studies in Shinto and Shrines, p. 433. The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Some time later, these relics, including the sacred sword were moved to the current location of Atsuta Shrine.Ponsonby- Fane, p. 434. The statue of Yamato Takeru at Kenroku-en Yamato Takeru is believed to have died somewhere in Ise Province. According to the legend, the name of Mie Prefecture was derived from his final words. After death his soul turned into a great white bird and flew away. His tomb in Ise is known as the Mausoleum of the White Plover. A statue of Yamato Takeru stands in Kenroku-en in Kanazawa, Ishikawa.  Comparative mythology  Anthropologist C. Scott Littleton has described the Yamato Takeru legend as \\"Arthurian\\"Littleton, C.S. (1983). due to some structural similarities with the King Arthur legend. Common points include the use of two magic swords, of which the first validates the authority of the hero; the leadership role of a war band; the death to an enemy after giving up the sword to a female figure; a transportation to the after world; and others.Littleton, C. S. (1995), p. 262. Littleton proposed that both legends descend from a common northeast Iranian ancestor.Littleton, C. S. (1995). In popular culture *One of the feats of Yamato Takeru was recounted in the \\"Grasscutter\\" volume of Stan Sakai's graphic novel series, Usagi Yojimbo, as well as the legend of how Kusanagi-no- Tsurugi was transferred to the Atsuta Shrine. *The second book of Noriko Ogiwara's The Jade Trilogy, Mirror Sword and Shadow Prince, is a retelling of Yamato Takeru's legend. The novel follows Oguna, a.k.a. Prince Ousu, one of the two main protagonists. *Yamato Takeru is seen in a dream in the epilogue to \\"The Golden Princess\\", one of the Novels of the Change. The sword itself is the major plot point. *In Digimon Adventure series, two of main characters are brothers, and their names are a reference to Yamato Takeru: Yamato Ishida and Takeru Takaishi.

It was based on a site on Springfield Road (part of the A607) in Grantham, Lincolnshire. History =Second World War= Created and funded under the Air Ministry's Shadow factory plan headed up by Herbert Austin, the company was founded by William Denis Kendall. Shortly after start- up during the Second World War rearmament period, Kendall became MP for Grantham from 1942 to 1950. By 1943, its two production units fulfilled 46% of the UK's demand for the Hispano-Suiza 20 mm cannon. The remainder came from The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) shadow factory in Newcastle- under-Lyme, 25%; Poole Royal Ordnance Factory, 25%; and the Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield, 3%. At the time of the Battle of Britain in 1940, 20 mm cannon were only just starting to arm the Spitfire and Hurricane. By 1943, the RAF had converted entirely to cannon armament for its fighters. Grantham received 21 raids by the Luftwaffe for precisely this reason, which killed 70 people in 1941-2 (many around the Commercial Road and Norton Street area on 9 January and 4 February in 1941). One notable raid was on 24 October 1942 when 30 people were killed when bombs destroyed most of Stuart Streethttp://www.roll-of-honour.com/Lincolnshire/Spitalgate.html and its air- raid shelter. The Ministry of Aircraft Production site on Springfield Road was hit on 27 January 1941, when a plane was shot down. The factory was also attacked in daylight on 3 December 1940, but the plane was damaged by the 3rd Kesteven (Grantham and Spittlegate) Battalion who had an anti-aircraft battery at the factory. The 1942 morale-raising film The Foreman Went to France was based on an employee of the Grantham factory. Melbourne Johns, from Pembrokeshire, was working at the Grantham factory and realised in 1940 that the Hispano-Suiza factory in France had important Deep Hole Boring Machines that could be of immense value to the Germans and set out on a mission with a team to recover the equipment. Finding the French factory and local village deserted, they drove the equipment back to England on a lorry. Melbourne Johns died in Grantham in 1955. The Deep Hole Boring Machine (DHBM), used for drilling the barrels of the guns, in the Grantham factory was very valuable, and was encased in a specially-made bomb-proof shelter. =Post-war= Royal Navy 20 mm cannon In 1974, the company acquired a site at Faldingworth, near Market Rasen which had two indoor firing ranges for testing and proving of cannon (Oerlikon 20 mm cannon). The site also had the capability to store nuclear weapons such as Redbeard and WE.177. This site is currently used by BAE Systems. The company also made the Oerlikon 30 mm twin cannon (GCM). BMARC was a subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza (Suisse), S.A. in Geneva and then was owned from 1970 to 1987 by Oerlikon, the Swiss defence contractor. It was then sold to British Astra Holdings, which had a head office in Kent, in May 1988. In the 1990s, the company was investigated for alleged illegal dealings with Iraq. Jonathan Aitken was a non-executive director of the company from September 1988, and in a libel trial in March 1997, BMARC was accused of selling weapons to Iran.BBC trial report On 11 December 1995, an ITV World in Action programme covered the subject and the Scott Report. It was extensively (and exclusively) investigated by the Guardian newspaper, largely motivated by the potential to discredit (and later convict) Jonathan Aitken. =Financial collapse= On 4 February 1992, after owing ¬£50 million, Astra went into receivership. In Britain, it also owned the pyrotechnics company Haley & Weller (who made grenades). After the financial collapse of Astra Holdings, in April 1992 BMARC was bought by British Aerospace, briefly becoming part of Royal Ordnance. The company closed the Grantham site later in 1992, and the site was sold in 1994.

Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified or the Washing Away of Wrongs is a Chinese book written by Song Ci in 1247 during the Song Dynasty (960-1276) as a handbook for coroners. The author combined many historical cases of forensic science with his own experiences and wrote the book with an eye to avoiding injustice. The book was esteemed by generations of officials, and it was eventually translated into English, German, Japanese, French and other languages. It is the first ever written book of forensic science. Content Different versions of the book exist, but the earliest existing version was published during the Yuan Dynasty, containing fifty-three chapters in five volumes. The first volume describes the imperial decree issued by Song Dynasty on the inspection of bodies and injuries. The second volume contains notes and methods on post-mortem examinations. The third, fourth, and fifth volumes detail the appearances of corpses from various causes of death and methods of treatments to certain injuries of a wounded person. Song Ci ruled regulation about autopsy report for court, how to protect the evidence in the examining process, the reason why workers must show examination to public impartiality;Song, Ci, and Brian E.

McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 79-85. In the book, Song said: > The particulars of each case must be recorded in the doctor‚Äôs own > handwriting. No one else is allowed to write his autopsy report. A coroner > must not avoid performing an autopsy just because he detests the stench of > corpses. A coroner must refrain from sitting comfortably behind a curtain of > incense that masks the stench, letting his subordinates do the autopsy > unsupervised, or allowing a petty official to write his autopsy report, > otherwise any potential inaccuracy is unchecked and uncorrected.‚Äù He also said: > ‚ÄúShould there be any inaccuracy in an autopsy report, injustice would remain > with the deceased as well as the living. A wrongful death sentence without > justice may claim one or more additional lives, which would in turn result > in feuds and revenges, prolonging the tragedy. In order to avoid any > miscarriage of justice, the coroner must immediately examine the case > personally.‚Äù Importance to the history of forensic entomology In The Washing Away of Wrongs, the first documented forensic entomology case is reported. In 1235 A.D., a stabbing occurred in a Chinese village. By testing different blades on an animal carcass, it was determined that the wound was caused by a sickle. After further questioning, the investigator had all villagers bring their sickles and lay them out before the crowd. Blow flies were attracted to a single sickle because invisible remnants of blood and tissue still adhered to it. The owner of the alleged sickle later broke down and confessed the crime. In other areas of the text, the author demonstrates knowledge of blow fly activity on bodies relative to those orifices infested, the time of infestation, and the effect of trauma on attractiveness of tissue to such insects. Brian McKnight describes the murder case involving the sickle as thus: > A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death > by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the > rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had > committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by > calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village > square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. > Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their > hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. > The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates > waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the > village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on > one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many > had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None > of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner > of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before > all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame > and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses > of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow > flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, > bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was > committed.

The film stars Shin Ha-kyun as Ryu, a young, deaf-mute factory worker trying to earn enough money for his sister's kidney transplant by holding the daughter of a wealthy man for ransom, and the path of vengeance that follows when the plan goes awry. Alongside Ha-kyun, the film's cast includes Song Kang-ho, Bae Doona, Han Bo- bae, and Im Ji-eun. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance did not fare well commercially upon its initial release in South Korea, and has garnered mixed reviews. Despite this, it won several awards. It is the first installment in director Chan-wook's thematic Vengeance Trilogy, and is followed by Oldboy (2003) and Lady Vengeance (2005). Plot Ryu is a deaf-mute man who works in a factory. His ailing sister is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, but Ryu's is not a match. After he loses his job, Ryu contacts a group of black market organ dealers to exchange one of his kidneys for one that his sister can use. However, the dealers disappear after taking Ryu's kidney and severance money. A legitimate kidney donor is found, but after having been conned by the organ dealers, Ryu is unable afford the operation. To raise money, Yeong-mi, Ryu's radical anarchist girlfriend, suggests kidnapping the daughter of the executive that fired Ryu. They observe the executive with company president Park Dong-jin arriving at the latter's home one day, where one of Dong-jin's employees, Peng, attempts to commit harakiri in front of them. Ryu and Yeong- mi change their plan, deciding to kidnap Dong-jin's young daughter Yu-sun. Yu- sun stays with Ryu's sister, who believes that Ryu is babysitting her. Ryu and Yeong-mi send a request for ransom to Dong-jin, and he obliges. Upon returning home with the ransom money, Ryu discovers that his sister learned that Yu-sun was kidnapped, and committed suicide. Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body to a riverbed they frequented as children to bury her. Distracted by the burial and unable to hear, Ryu is unaware when Yu-sun slips into the river, and she drowns. After Yu-sun's body is discovered by authorities, a deeply mournful Dong-jin hires an investigator to find her kidnappers. Dong-jin finds Ryu's sister's corpse by the riverbed, interacts with a mentally disabled man who witnessed Ryu burying his sister, and begins to piece together the identities of Ryu and Yeong-mi. Ryu, armed with a baseball bat, locates the organ traffickers and murders them, receiving a stab wound in the process. Meanwhile, Dong-jin finds Yeong-mi and tortures her with electricity. She apologizes for Yu-sun's death but warns Dong-jin that her terrorist friends will kill him if she dies. Unfazed, Dong-jin electrocutes her to death. Ryu returns to Yeong-mi's apartment and sees the police removing her corpse. Dong- jin knocks Ryu unconscious with a booby trap. He takes Ryu to the riverbed where his daughter died, dragging him into the water, slashing his Achilles tendons and waiting for him to bleed to death. After Dong-jin dismembers Ryu's corpse, Yeong-mi's terrorist associates arrive. They stab Dong-jin, pin a note to his chest with a knife, and leave him to die.

Club, Tasha Robinson wrote that Chan-wook's \\"style is as bold and uncompromising as his story, which seems designed to show how revenge dehumanizes more than it satisfies, even for people who wholly deserve revenge.

Endemics-area relationships: The influence of species dominance and spatial aggregation. Ecology 84:3090‚Äì3097. The species‚Äìarea relationship has been reputed to follow from the 2nd law of thermodynamics. In contrast to these \\"mechanistic\\" explanations, others assert the need to test whether the pattern is simply the result of a random sampling process.Connor, E.F. and E.D. McCoy. 1979. The statistics and biology of the species‚Äìarea relationship. American Naturalist 113:791‚Äì833. Authors have classified the species‚Äìarea relationship according to the type of habitats being sampled and the census design used. Frank W. Preston, an early investigator of the theory of the species‚Äìarea relationship, divided it into two types: samples (a census of a contiguous habitat that grows in census area, also called \\"mainland\\" species‚Äìarea relationships), and isolates (a census of discontiguous habitats, such as islands, also called \\"island\\" species‚Äìarea relationships). Michael Rosenzweig also notes that species‚Äìarea relationships for very large areas‚Äîthose collecting different biogeographic provinces or continents‚Äîbehave differently from species‚Äìarea relationships from islands or smaller contiguous areas. It has been presumed that \\"island\\"-like species‚Äìarea relationships have higher slopes (in log‚Äìlog space) than \\"mainland\\" relationships, but a 2006 metaanalysis of almost 700 species‚Äìarea relationships found the former had lower slopes than the latter.Drakare S, Lennon J.L., Hillebrand H., 2006 The imprint of the geographical, evolutionary and ecological context on species‚Äìarea relationships Ecology Letters 9 (2), 215‚Äì227 Regardless of census design and habitat type, species‚Äìarea relationships are often fit with a simple function. Frank Preston advocated the power function based on his investigation of the lognormal species-abundance distribution. If S is the number of species, A is the habitat area, and z is the slope of the species area relationship in log-log space, then the power function species‚Äìarea relationship goes as: S = cA^z Here c is a constant which depends on the unit used for area measurement, and equals the number of species that would exist if the habitat area was confined to one square unit. The graph looks like a straight line on log‚Äìlog axes, and can be linearized as: \\\\log(S) = \\\\log(cA^z) = \\\\log(c) + z \\\\log(A) In contrast, Henry Gleason championed the semilog model: S = \\\\log(cA^z) = \\\\log(c) + z \\\\log(A) which looks like a straight line on semilog axes, where area is logged and the number of species is arithmetic. In either case, the species‚Äìarea relationship is almost always decelerating (has a negative second derivative) when plotted arithmetically.Arrhenius, O. 1921. \\"Species and Area\\" J. Ecol. 9: 95‚Äì99 Species‚Äìarea relationships are often graphed for islands (or habitats that are otherwise isolated from one another, such as woodlots in an agricultural landscape) of different sizes. Although larger islands tend to have more species, it is possible that a smaller island will have more than a larger one. In contrast, species-area relationships for contiguous habitats will always rise as areas increases, provided that the sample plots are nested within one another. The species‚Äìarea relationship for mainland areas (contiguous habitats) will differ according to the census design used to construct it.Scheiner, S.M. 2003. Six types of species‚Äìarea curves. Global Ecology and Biogeography 12:441‚Äì447. A common method is to use quadrats of successively larger size, so that the area enclosed by each one includes the area enclosed by the smaller one (i.e. areas are nested). In the first part of the 20th century, plant ecologists often used the species‚Äìarea curve to estimate the minimum size of a quadrat necessary to adequately characterize a community. This is done by plotting the curve (usually on arithmetic axes, not log-log or semilog axes), and estimating the area after which using larger quadrats results in the addition of only a few more species. This is called the minimal area. A quadrat that encloses the minimal area is called a relev√©, and using species‚Äìarea curves in this way is called the relev√© method. It was largely developed by the Swiss ecologist Josias Braun-Blanquet.Barbour, M. G., Burk, J. H., & Pitts, W. D. (1980). Terrestrial plant ecology. Menlo Park CA: Benjamin/Cummings. Pp. 158‚Äì160. Estimation of the minimal area from the curve is necessarily subjective, so some authors prefer to define minimal area as the area enclosing at least 95 percent (or some other large proportion) of the total species found. The problem with this is that the species area curve does not usually approach an asymptote, so it is not obvious what should be taken as the total. In fact, the number of species always increases with area up to the point where the area of the entire world has been accumulated.Williamson, M., K.J. Gaston, and W.M. Lonsdale. 2001.

The park comprises three separate gardens, which stretch along all the length of the western Kremlin wall for between the building of the Moscow Manege and the Kremlin. History Tomb of the Unknown Soldier After the Napoleonic Wars, Tsar Alexander I ordered architect Osip Bove to reconstruct parts of the city which had been destroyed by French troops. Bove laid out a new garden from 1819-1823, on the site of the riverbed of the Neglinnaya River, which was channeled underground. Layout =Upper Garden= Towards the main entrance to the park is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with an eternal flame brought from the Field of Mars in Leningrad. Created in 1967, it contains the body of a soldier who fell during the Great Patriotic War at the kilometer 41 marker of Leningradskoe Shosse, the nearest point the forces of Nazi Germany penetrated towards Moscow. Post Number One, where the honor sentinels stand on guard, used to be located in front of Lenin's Mausoleum, but was moved to the Tomb of The Unknown Soldier in the 1990s. The middle section of the upper garden contains a faux ruined grotto built underneath the Middle Arsenal Tower. Although not constructed until 1841, this was part of Bove's original design. The garden's cast iron gate and grille were designed to commemorate the Russian victories over Napoleon, and its rocks are rubble from buildings destroyed during the French occupation of Moscow. In front of the grotto is an obelisk erected on July 10 1914, a year after the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty was celebrated. The monument made of granite from Finland listed all of the Romanov Tsars and had the coats of arms of the (Russian) provinces. Four years later, the dynasty was gone, and the Bolsheviks (per Lenin‚Äôs directive on Monumental propaganda) removed the imperial eagle, and re-carved the monument with a list of 19 socialist and communist philosophers and political leaders, personally approved by Lenin. Originally in the Lower Garden, it was relocated to its present location in 1966. There is discussion to remove Lenin's and reinstall an obelisk duplicating the original. The wrought iron grille, enclosing this part of the garden, has a design of fasces, which are intended to commemorate the military victory over Napoleon. The northern part of the garden is adjacent to the large underground shopping complex at Manege Square. =Middle Garden= The most prominent feature of the Middle Garden is the outlying Kutafya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin. There is an entrance to the park opposite the tower directly to the Moscow Metro system. =Lower Garden= Laid out in 1823, the Lower Garden stretches to the road leading to the Borovitskaya Tower, one of two vehicular and pedestrian entrances to the Kremlin.

Location The town is located , by road, south east of the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city. This location lies on the Bulawayo‚ÄìBeitbridge Road and the Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway. The town of Beitbridge, at Zimbabwe's border with the Republic of South Africa, lies approximately , further southeast on Highway A-6. The coordinates of Gwanda, Zimbabwe are: 20¬∞56'20.0\\"S, 29¬∞01'07.0\\"E (Latitude:-20.938889; Longitude:29.018611). Gwanda sits at an average elevation of above mean sea level. Overview Gwanda was founded in 1900 as a settlement of European gold miners and prospectors. Its name derives from that of a nearby hill known as Jahunda. It is located on the Bulawayo- Beitbridge road and the railway that runs south to West Nicholson. The town is the a centre for Matebeleland South‚Äôs cattle ranching industry and also trades in agricultural produce. There are gold, asbestos, and chrome mines in the vicinity, and game reseves nearby. Stone Age implements have been found in the Gwalingemba Hills, which are located 32 miles (52 km) south of Gwanda Gwanda is administratively run by theMunicipality of Gwanda, whose jurisdiction covers 10 wards across the town. Gwanda is the location of the District headquarters of Gwanda District. It is also home to the Matabeleland South provincial offices of various government departments, which are mainly located at the government complex along 3rd Avenue, between Queen Street and Khartoum Street. The town has a provincial hospital, Gwanda Provincial Hospital, which serves as a referral centre for nearby smaller mission and district hospitals. Services provided include emergency medicine, paediatrics, maternity, eye surgery, minor orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and an expanded immunisation program. The town is the chief centre for south-western Zimbabwe's cattle district and also trades in agricultural produce. There are asbestos, chromium and gold mines around Gwanda. The main stadium is called Phelandaba Stadium. It was home to the former Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League team, Njube Sundowns. Financial services are provided by commercial banks, including CBZ Bank Limited, Post Office Savings Bank, AgriBank Zimbabwe and ZB Bank Limited. Population According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 4,874. The town chiefs refused to acknowledge the results of the 1992 census as they felt they had been undercounted. Officially, that disputed figure was 10,565. In 2012, the national population census enumerated te towns population was at 20,226. Notable people The former president of Zambia, Rupiah Banda, was born in this town, in a place called Miko.

Before the fight Salvador S√°nchez had a record of 37 wins, 1 loss and one draw, with 29 knockouts. He had won the WBC world Featherweight championship by defeating Danny Lopez by a thirteenth-round knockout on February 2 of that year. He followed that win with defenses against Ruben Castillo, Lopez in a rematch and Patrick Ford. Despite the fact that Sanchez was a world champion, he had reached celebrity status only in his native Mexico and among hardcore boxing fans. It was when Sanchez beat Wilfredo G√≥mez that it can be said Sanchez gained full celebrity status. On the other hand, Laporte was even lesser known than Sanchez, as even many among his fellow Puerto Ricans did not know him. He was known more than anywhere else in the New York City area, having fought at the Madison Square Garden often during the early parts of his career. He sported a record of 15 wins and 1 loss, with 8 wins by knockout, coming into his bout with Sanchez. The fight Laporte was a mandatory challenger, meaning that Sanchez had to defend his WBC title against him or he could be stripped of the world championship. Don King, Sanchez's promoter, figuring that the fight would sell more tickets in a state near Mexico, worked a deal for the fight to take place in El Paso. A decisively pro-Sanchez crowd filled the County Coliseum the night of the fight. The event was televised live on ABC. Laporte, the underdog, pressed Sanchez into a torrid pace since early on in the bout. Sanchez was never knocked down in his career; Laporte only once in over 50 fights. The two boxers traded punches toe to toe for most of the encounter, but Sanchez utilized his experience to his advantage. The less experienced Laporte, however, kept firing back at Sanchez, connecting with multiple hard shots that bounced off Sanchez's head and chin. By the latter rounds, Sanchez's expertise was becoming more evident, as he repeatedly shook Laporte with blows to the head. Laporte, however, hung in and kept trying to overtake the champion. Much to the delight of the crowd, Laporte did not refuse to trade punches with the champion until the bell rang to end round fifteen, signifying the end of the bout. Fans gave both fighters a standing ovation after the bout was over. Sanchez retained the title by unanimous decision, with scores of 148-142 (8-2-5 in rounds), 146-139 (11-4) and 147-140 (10-3-2). The aftermath Sanchez was so impressed by his foe's performance that he went over to Laporte's dressing room and told Laporte that he would be the next great world Featherweight champion. Laporte and Sanchez forged a friendship that lasted for the rest of Sanchez's life after the bout. On August 21, 1981, Sanchez finally reached cross-over celebrity when he knocked out G√≥mez, as aforementioned, in eight rounds at Las Vegas, Nevada. After having defeated Azumah Nelson to retain his title, Sanchez reportedly signed a contract to fight Laporte in a rematch, and he went to training soon after. Sanchez's words to Laporte after their fight would tragically become prophetic when Sanchez was killed in a car accident on August 12 of 1982, and, on September 15, Laporte captured the vacant WBC world Featherweight title by knocking out Mario Miranda in ten rounds at the Madison Square Garden.

These are renowned for mural paintings by master painters of ancient India. The use of the word \\"cave\\" is a bit of a misnomer, since these are not natural, but instead examples of Indian rock-cut architecture. The Bagh caves, like those at Ajanta, were excavated by master craftsmen on perpendicular sandstone rock face of a hill on the far bank of a seasonal stream, the Baghani. Buddhist in inspiration, of the nine caves, only five have survived. All of them are 'viharas' or resting places of monks monasteries having quadrangular plan. A small chamber, usually at the back, forms the 'chaitya', the prayer hall. Most significant of these five extant caves is the Cave 4, commonly known as the Rang Mahal (Palace of Colors). The Bagh Caves were quarried in the 5th -6th century AD, in the very late stages of Buddhism in India, and long after most of the Indian Buddhist Caves had been built, many of them since the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE. They are believed to have been built by Satavahana dynasty during the 5-7th century. Archaeological Survey of India has restored the place over 17 years.https://www.outlookindia.com/traveller/mp/inspire- me/heritage/bagh-caves-palace-colours/ The Paintings The paintings on the wall and ceilings of the viharas of Bagh, the fragments of which are still visible in Cave 3 and Cave 4 (remnants seen also in Caves 2, 5 and 7), were executed in tempera. These paintings are materialistic rather than spiritualistic. The ground prepared was a reddish-brown gritty and thick mud plaster, laid out on the walls and ceilings. Over the plaster, lime-priming was done, on which these paintings were executed. Some of the most beautiful paintings were on the walls of the portico of Cave 4. To prevent further loss of the values of Indian classical art, most paintings were carefully removed in 1982 and today can be seen in Archaeological Museum of Gwalior.

It was first noticed by South African astronomer R. Watson on 25 May 1925 when it had an apparent magnitude of 2.3. It continued to brighten to magnitude 1.2, which it reached on 9 June 1925. It dimmed to magnitude 4 by 4 July, but brightened again to 1.9 on 9 August. Six months after its peak brightness, RR Pictoris faded to be invisible to the unaided eye, and was magnitude 12.5 by 1975. Novae are close binary systems composed of a white dwarf and secondary star that is so close it is filling up its Roche lobe with stellar material, which is then transferred onto the first star's accretion disc. Once this material reaches a critical mass, it ignites and the system brightens tremendously. The two stars of RR Pictoris orbit each other every 3.48 hours. Calculations of the speed suggest the secondary star is not dense enough for its size to still be on the main sequence, so it itself must have begun expanding and cooling already as its core has run out of hydrogen fuel. The RR Pictoris system is estimated to lie around 520 parsecs (1700 light- years) distant from Earth.

The light curve for the eruption had a long plateau period. Photographic plates taken for 30 years prior to the eruption show that BT Monocerotis remained visible during that period. Prior to 1933, BT Monocerotis had an average magnitude of 15.52 with a variation of 1.2 magnitudes. It retained the same magnitude until the eruption, showing a variation of 0.9 magnitudes. Thus it did not show a pre-eruption rise in brightness. This is an interacting binary star system consisting of a white dwarf primary star and a main sequence star with a stellar classification of G8V. The orbit has a period of 0.33381379 days and an inclination of 88.2¬∞ to the line of sight to the Earth, resulting in an eclipsing binary. The nova eruption is believed to have been driven by mass transferred from the secondary star to the white dwarf.

Prior to his broadcasting career, Maller was considered one of the first influential sports bloggers after he broke several stories on his now defunct website. Maller made his first foray into broadcasting when he joined the NBC Sports Network as a regular contributor to NBC SportsTalk in late 2011 until the spring of 2012. He gained some media attention during this time for losing 200 pounds in only 62 weeks by changing his diet and exercise regimen.\\"Sports Radio Host Ben Maller Drops 200 Pounds Early life Maller grew up in Irvine, California and attended Irvine High School. Maller began to fall behind in school and consequently was placed in S.E.L.F. (Secondary Education Learning Facility, now known as Creekside High School), the city's alternative education program. Nonetheless he managed to play high school football for the town's University High School while enrolled at S.E.L.F. Aside from playing football, Maller also had an interest in sports journalism and broadcasting. After finishing high school, Maller enrolled in Saddleback College in the nearby city of Mission Viejo. He continued his interest in sports broadcasting doing Saddleback College Gauchos men's basketball and football games on KSBR before landing a job as an AM sports radio journalist.

(Cgm 37, dated c. 1325-1350). The Kaiserchronik (Imperial Chronicle) is a 12th-century chronicle written in 17,283 lines of Middle High German verse.Frank Shaw, \\"Kaiserchronik\\", Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle, 2010, p. 956.Eberhard Nellmann, \\"Kaiserchronik\\", Lexikon des Mittelalters, vol. 5, 1991 It runs from Julius Caesar to Conrad III, and seeks to give a complete account of the history of Roman and German emperors and kings, based on a historiographical view of the continuity of the Roman and German successions. The overall pattern is of a progression from pagan to Christian worlds, and theological disputations stand at the turning-points of the Christianization of the Empire.Graeme Dunphy, \\"On the Function of the Disputations in the Kaiserchronik\\", The Medieval Chronicle, 5 (2009), pp. 77-86. However, much of the material is legendary and fantastic, suggesting that large sections are compiled from earlier works, mostly shorter biographies and saints' lives.Friedrich Ohly, Sage und Legende in der Kaiserchronik, 1940. The chronicle was written in Regensburg some time after 1146. The poet (or at least the final compiler) was presumably a cleric in secular service, a partisan of the Guelphs. However the view that it was written by Konrad der Pfaffe, author of the Rolandslied, has been discredited. Known sources include the Chronicon Wirzeburgense, the Chronicle of Ekkehard of Aura, and the Annolied; the relationship to the Annolied has received particular attention in scholarship, as earlier views of the priority of the Kaiserchronik, or of a shared source, were gradually dismissed.Mathias Herweg, Ludwigslied, De Heinrico, Annolied: Die deutschen Zeitdichtungen des fr√ºhen Mittelalters im Spiegel ihrer wissenschaftlichen Rezeption und Erforschung, Wiesbaden: Reichert, 2002. Judging from the large number of surviving manuscripts (twelve complete and seventeen partial), it must have been very popular, and it was twice continued in the 13th century: the first addition, the \\"Bavarian continuation\\", comprised 800 verses, while the second, the \\"Swabian continuation\\", which brought the poem to the Interregnum (1254-73), consisted of 483 lines. The Kaiserchronik in turn was used as an important source for other verse chronicles in the thirteenth century, most notably that of Jans der Enikel. The text of the Kaiserchronik is preserved in a total of some 50 manuscripts, of which 20 have the full text. Of these, five predate the 14th century, including one of the late 12th century (the Vorau ms.).handschriftencensus.de The main witnesses are: *Vorau, Stiftsbibl., Cod. 276 (fr√ºher XI), c. 1175-1200 (Schr√∂der ms. 1) *Heidelberg, Universit√§tsbibl., Cpg 361, mid-13th c.

Der keiser und der kunige buoch, oder die sogenannte Kaiserchronik, Gedicht des 12. Jahrhunderts in 18578 Reimzeilen. 3 vols. (Quedlinburg, Basse, 1849‚Äì54) Massmann was in a bitter academic dispute with August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, an \\"almost proprietal struggle\\" over the priority of the respective manuscripts they had access to. M√ºller (1999) categorizes Massmann's work as an editionsphilologischer Amoklauf (as it were \\"editorial philology gone postal\\"), as Massmann goes out of his way to ignore the Vorau ms., to the point of using the 1639 edition of Annolied by Martin Opitz as a \\"Kaiserchronik fragment\\" in higher standing than the Vorau ms.Stephan M√ºller, Vom Annolied zur Kaiserchronik: Zur Text- und Forschungsgeschichte einer verlorenen deutschen Reimchronik, Heidelberg: Carl Winter 1999. \\"Muller rightly categorizes Massmann's Kaiserchronik as an 'editionsphilologischer Amoklauf', highlighting how he cited Opitz's Annolied as a Kaiserchronik fragment and used it as such in his own apparatus. Massmann insisted on the priority of the Heidelberg manuscript over that of Vorau, largely because he had access to it, which put him personally in a position of power. Editing the Daniel passages, which are missing in the Heidelberg manuscript, he spurned the Vorau text, adopting instead the wording of Opitz with the verses rearranged into the Vorau manuscript's sequence. Muller cheekily calls early scholars like Massmann, whose work has been superseded yet whose influence lingers, the 'Untoten', the 'living dead'.\\" Graeme Dunphy, review of M√ºller (1999) in Modern Language Review, 98 (2003), pp. 755-757.

Known for family- friendly living, the area is centred around a park of , which opened in 1887 and was named to honour Queen Victoria. The area takes its name from the park, and in turn gives its name to Queens Park Rangers football club. Architecturally, Queen's Park is an important historic area, with a unified urban layout with a high level of building preservation. The park is a good example of a Victorian urban green space, and the surrounding streets largely comprise original two- and three-storey Victorian buildings.http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s14308/Queens Geography =Administrative background= Queens Park has never been an administrative unit and so it has never had formally defined boundaries; its northern part lies in Willesden (in the modern London Borough of Brent), while the south lies in Paddington (in the modern City of Westminster). These areas were a Municipal and Metropolitan Borough respectively, and have their origins in early medieval ancient parishes. The area also included a detached exclave of the parish of Chelsea which adjoined the boundaries of both Paddington and Willesden. This was in the vicinity of the (like Queens Park, also informally defined) Kensal Green and Kensal Town areas.On the location of the former Chelsea exclave https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/MDX/Paddington/churches All three of these parishes were in the Ossulstone Hundred of Middlesex. In 1855 the vestry of the Chelsea parish was incorporated as a local council in the metropolitan area of London governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Willesden parish remained outside the area and formed a local government district from 1874. In 1889 the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works that included the southern section of Queen's Park was transferred from Middlesex to the County of London. In 1900 the anomaly of the Chelsea exclave was removed by uniting it with the parish and borough of Paddington.British History Online https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp173-174 In 1965, Paddington merged into the City of Westminster and Willesden became part of the new London Borough of Brent. Like Queens Park, Kilburn is another informally defined area that spans the boundaries of more formally defined areas. Some areas of Queen‚Äôs Park are also sometimes described as part of Kilburn. Not to get it confused Kensal Rise is part of the wider Queen‚Äôs Park area although Kensal town and Kensal Green are not, they come under north Kensington. =Neighbouring areas= Neighbouring areas include North Kensington to the south, Kensal Green to the west, Willesden to the north and Kilburn to the east. There is a degree of overlap in perceptions of the extent of these areas. History  =19th century= The area around Queen's Park was developed from 1875, and was named to honour Queen Victoria. The open space opened in 1887, located to the north, also shares the name. In 1879 the Royal Agricultural Society annual show was held on the area which would become Queen's Park. The 100 acre site was chosen for its proximity to the railway network, Queen's Park Station having opened on 2 June 1879 on the main line from London to Birmingham, just in time to facilitate the movement of heavy machinery and stock. By the 1870s the annual shows had become major events and the Kilburn show was to be the largest ever held. The show was opened on 30 June 1879 by the Prince and Princess of Wales and saw an entry of 11,878 implements, 2,879 livestock entries and over 187,000 visitors. Poor weather and deep mud led to low attendance, but a visit by Queen Victoria on the fifth day, where she was driven on a specially constructed drive of ballast and brick from the new station along Salusbury Road on a route lined with cheering crowds, rallied visitors. In 1884 the North West London Park League was formed to secure the site as a people's park. The League appealed to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners not to sell the land for building until the future of the site could be assured as a public open space. In 1885 the Estates Committee of the Commissioners agreed to offer the use of the central portion of the land of for public use and that the remaining portion of the site would be laid out as housing to derive the most benefit from the frontage onto the proposed park. The offer was to be made through the Lord Mayor to the City of London Corporation, conditional on Parliamentary sanction. At 3:00p.m. 5 September 1887 Queen's Park officially opened with several thousand people present. Victorian houses on Chevening Road in Queen's Park, built around 1899. The houses around Queen's Park were erected over a number of years starting with the north side of Harvist Road of which the majority were completed by 1899. The west side of Chevening Road was also under construction in 1899 by local builders Bennet and Gimbrett to the design of G. A. Sexton. Many builders contributed to the estate which helped to generate the varied architectural character that can be seen on Kempe, Keslake and Chamberlayne Roads. The football team Queens Park Rangers was formed in Queen's Park in 1886, and became a professional team in 1889. =20th century= A map showing the Queen's Park ward of Paddington Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. In 1915 the Bakerloo Line was extended to Queen's Park station., the nearby Kensal Green station appearing in 1916. Both stations offer easy access to Paddington, Charing Cross and Waterloo mainline stations In 1917 Queens Park Rangers moved away from the area to the Loftus Road stadium in nearby Shepherd's Bush. In summer 1979 The Jam recorded their music video When You're Young in Queen's Park, making use of the bandstand. In 1986 Brent Council with the support of English Heritage made the area around Queen's Park a Conservation Area in recognition of its special architectural and historic character. Subsequently, in 1993 the designated area was extended westwards towards Chamberlayne Road. Governance The area give its name to two electoral wards, which unusually are both named Queen's Park since they belong to two different London boroughs. The area north of Kilburn Lane is the Queen's Park ward of the London Borough of Brent, while the area south of Kilburn Lane is the Queen's Park ward of the City of Westminster. =Queen's Park (London Borough of Brent)= The Queen's Park ward in the south-east of the London Borough of Brent is represented by three Labour Party councillors on Brent London Borough Council as of the 2018 election. This ward forms part of the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, represented by Labour MP Tulip Siddiq. =Queen's Park (City of Westminster)= The Queen's Park ward in the north west of the City of Westminster is represented by three Labour Party councillors on Westminster City Council. This ward forms part of the Westminster North parliamentary constituency, represented by Labour MP Karen Buck. In May 2012 residents of the ward voted in favour of the establishment of a Queen's Park civil parish and parish council. In June 2012, Westminster City Council approved the establishment of the first civil parish created in London since new legislation was enacted in 2007. The first election of councillors to Queens Park Community Council took place in May 2014 at the same time as other local elections. Subsequent elections will be held every four years at the same time as elections to the City Council with a new Parish Council being elected as part of the 2018 Westminster City Council election . The park The northwest part of Queen's Park The park was laid out by Alexander McKenzie between March 1887 and June 1887. McKenzie was a leading figure in Victorian park design, part of an influential group of landscape designers which included Robert Marnock, Joseph Meston and William Robinson who led garden design away from the parterres and geometry of earlier Victorian gardens to a more natural style of gardening. Designed without any straight paths, Queen's Park makes extensive use of bold tree planting and shrubberies with natural outlines, and large open areas of lawn for recreation and sport. Facilities in the park include six all-weather tennis courts, a pitch-and-putt course, an ornamental quiet garden, a children's playground with paddling pool, a children's animal farm and a cafe. The bandstand in Queen's Park A landmark in the park is the bandstand, which was completed in 1887 using ironwork supplied by Walter Fariane & Co. of Glasgow, and a timber roof with wrought-iron scrolled devices to each facet, and a central wrought- iron lantern. The bandstand was Grade-II listed in 2000. The park is managed by the City of London Corporation. In 2020 it won Green Flag status for the 24th year in a row, and an additional Green Heritage Site award for its care and conservation of open space and facilities. The City of London focuses on sustainable management, recycling as much waste as possible. Grass clippings and wood are used to make mulch for shrubberies; everyday waste like cans, bottles and plastics are separated and recycled. Residents bring in their Christmas trees which are mulched and return for use on their own gardens. Rain water is recycled via a new drainage system. All water runs into a holding tank underground and can be pumped to various areas when needed.

Economy The Post Office on Salusbury Road The economic centre of Queen's Park is Salusbury Road, where there are many shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. The weekly Queen's Park Farmers' Market has around 40 stalls and takes place every Sunday between 10am and 2pm in the grounds of Salusbury Primary School on Salusbury Road, draws people from across north west London. The market was awarded market of the year at the Farmers‚Äô Market and Retail Association Local Food Awards in 2012.

He was probably from Corfu and lived in Constantinople. He was a critic of Manuel I Komnenos, and was imprisoned and blinded due to his participation in a conspiracy against the emperor. He is also identified by modern scholarship with Michael Sikidites (ŒúŒπœáŒ±·Ω¥Œª Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ¥ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ), who was condemned as a heresiarch in 1200. Life Manuscript miniature of Manuel I Komnenos, Vatican Library Glykas was born sometime in the first third of the 12th century, possibly . His probable birthplace was Corfu. He served as imperial secretary (grammatikos) under Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (), before being involved in a conspiracy against the emperor and being blinded. The blinding was probably partial or slight, since he continued his literary activity. The exact nature of this conspiracy is unknown, but Otto Kresten suggested a connection with the alleged conspiracy that led to the downfall of Manuel's chief minister Theodore Styppeiotes in 1158/9. He remained imprisoned until at least 1164, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Modern scholars commonly support his identity with a certain Michael Sikidites, charged with heresy and magic in . According to Niketas Choniates, this Sikidites \\"was enrolled among the imperial secretaries\\" of Manuel I, was known of performing magic spells, conjuring serpents and demons. He preached a doctrine according to which the sacraments of the Eucharist were mortal and corruptible, as Christ's own body was. Furthermore, Sikidites and his followers considered a bodily resurrection impossible, and thought that the dead would be resurrected as ghostly spirits only. The doctrine appears to have enjoyed some support in leading circles, notably of the Patriarchs of Constantinople George II Xiphilinos and John X Kamateros, but also aroused passionate opposition; in a synod in 1200, Sikidites was censured and his teachings declared heretical. Works His first known work were his Verses from Prison, a poem of 581 lines in political verse, written during his imprisonment. It contains many elements of the vernacular Greek language of his time (an early form of Modern Greek), in contrast to the highly stylized and archaic Attic Greek favoured by Byzantine intellectuals. In 1164/65, he composed an encomium celebrating Emperor Manuel's Hungarian campaign. He also wrote a mathematical treatise on the distinction between astronomy and astrology, where he severely criticised Manuel I for his fondness for the latter; in the same vein, Glykas strongly rejected the concept of inevitable fate (ananke) as a force in history. His chief work is his chronicle (Œ≤ŒØŒ≤ŒªŒøœÇ œáœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, biblos chronike) of events from the creation of the world to the death of Alexios I Komnenos in 1118. His main sources for the chronicle were George Monachos, John Skylitzes and his continuators, John Zonaras, and Constantine Manasses. Over half the work is dedicated to the narrative of the creation and early Jewish history. As a historical source, it contains no new information, but Glykas displays his opposition to the Komnenian dynasty, and emulates Zonaras in his criticism of Alexios I. Another notable work, which led Hans-Georg Beck to describe Glykas as the \\"most original and vivid exegete of the 12th century\\", was the collection of 95 replies on theological questions (Œï·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ ·ºÄœÄŒøœÅŒØŒ±œÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒòŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ŒìœÅŒ±œÜ·øÜœÇ Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ¨ŒªŒ±ŒπŒ±, Chapters on the questions on the Holy Scripture), written in letter form. Among them is a letter where he criticises Manuel I for his incorrect use of passages from the Church Fathers. His surviving work, including his letters, is \\"overtly didactic\\", promoting Christian virtues, and making extensive use of proverbs to this end. =Editions= * J.-P.

However, Wildman declined to provide the exact location and no gold was found. Little is known of Wildman's origins, or his life after 1864. Convict records state that Wildman was literate, a Protestant, and a labourer prior to his conviction. He was said to have been 25 years old on 18 March 1862, when he was found guilty of burglary and sentenced to 18 years' penal servitude in Derby, England. (Some contemporary sources reported, incorrectly, that he had been sentenced to 15 years in 1861.) Wildman arrived in Western Australia on the Lord Dalhousie on 28 December 1863. Two days after his arrival, Perth daily newspaper The Inquirer quoted Wildman as claiming that, on an early visit to Western Australia, he had found gold in the Camden Harbour area. In 1856, according to Wildman, he had been first mate on a Dutch ship, the Maria Augusta, sailing from Rotterdam to Java, when it was forced to stop in for rudder repairs. He had allegedly travelled up a river that drained into Camden Harbour, and found alluvial gold nuggets. After returning to England, according to Wildman, he had sold these nuggets in Liverpool, for ¬£416. He offered to lead a party to the area, in return for a remission of his sentence. Some later sources, such as W. B. Kimberly have suggested, without citing sources, that Wildman's claims were supported by a gold dealer in England. An exploring expedition to the area was launched, under the leadership of Police Inspector Frederick Panter and Dr James Martin. This expedition sailed from Fremantle on 2 March 1864. On arrival at Camden Harbour, Wildman became sullen and hostile, refusing to give any further information about the location of the gold. In his journal of the expedition, Panter mentions Wildman having an epileptic fit, and reports having him put in irons for insolent conduct. Wildman later tried to escape, but was unsuccessful. No gold was found, but the expedition found good land that was later settled. Following the failed expedition, Wildman is known to have completed his sentence. He is thought to have then left Western Australia, but neither the date nor his destination are known. Footnotes Bibliography  *Uren, Malcolm (1946).

She was National Statistician and Chief Executive of the Office for National Statistics of the United Kingdom and head of the Government Statistical Service from 1 September 2005 until retiring on 28 August 2009. Since its inception in 2008, she was also the Chief Executive of the UK Statistics Authority. She now has a range of non-executive roles including membership of Pricewaterhouse Coopers Public Interest Body, Trustee of National Heart Forum, member of the Court of Governors, University of Westminster. Background Born Karen Hope Williamson in Los Angeles, California (USA), she moved to Britain when she was a young child and was educated at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls and Bedford College, London. Her father was a US serviceman during World War II and her mother, who was English, was a teacher. Karen Dunnell has been married twice: to Keith Dunnell (1969‚Äì76) and Professor Michael Adler (1979‚Äì94). She has two adult daughters by her second marriage and two grandchildren. She lives in London and has a home in the Var in SE France. Career Karen Williamson studied sciences at school because she wanted to go into medicine. However, a growing interest in politics and society led her to study sociology at Bedford College, London, from where she graduated in 1967. She began her career as a health care researcher with the Institute of Community Studies, where much of her work involved healthcare surveys, and, in 1972, she wrote a book, Medicine Takers, Prescribers and Hoarders with Ann Cartwright,. This established a measure of morbidity and the relationship between medicines acquired through the NHS and over-the-counter. Dunnell then joined the Department of Community Medicine, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, London, working on multi-disciplinary projects alongside doctors, social scientists, statisticians and economists, including a major project that measured the cost of caring for people with severe disabilities in the community compared with the cost of caring for them in institutions. She joined the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) in 1974, as a social survey officer in the Survey Division, where she stayed for 15 years, working on, among other things, two major surveys. One of these was the UK's contribution to the World Fertility Survey, published as a book, Family Formation, in 1976. This measured cohabitation for the first time and first asked the question, now a standard, \\"At what age did you first have sexual intercourse?\\". The other studied the work of community nurses, using an intensive survey combined with diary-keeping. She was promoted to Assistant Director, overseeing all health surveys in the OPCS. These included surveys on drinking and smoking and a major survey on disability that established what proportion of people in different age groups had different disabilities. She was responsible, in this post, for liaising with the Department of Health. In 1990, she moved from working with health surveys in the OPCS to medical statistics. When OPCS merged with the Central Statistical Office to form the ONS in 1996, she became Director of Demography and Health Statistics, working on general practice statistics and inequalities in health, and established the Health Statistics Quarterly journal. In 1999, she moved to a central post responsible for launching National Statistics and dealing with the arrival of Len Cook, the first National Statistician, in 2000. She was promoted to Group Director in Social Statistics in 2000, managing health, demography, population, labour market and social reporting and was temporarily promoted to the Board of the ONS in 2001 in the run-up to the 2001 census. A major reorganisation, which divided the activities of ONS into 'sources' and 'analysis', followed and Dunnell was given the job of setting up the new \\"Sources\\" Directorate, bringing together household and business surveys, the infrastructure that supported them, the statistical modernisation programme and planning for the 2011 Census. She took up this post on the ONS Executive in 2002. =National Statistician= Karen Dunnell was appointed National Statistician and Director of the Office for National Statistics from 1 September 2005 at a time when the government was being criticised for the quality, credibility and uses to which it put the statistics generated both by ONS and by governments departments.\\"National Statistician ‚Äì Director office for National Statistics\\" , 10 Downing Street press release, 4 August 2005. Retrieved 5 June 2007.\\"Veteran insider to run the ONS balancing act\\", The Times, 5 August 2005. Retrieved 5 June 2007. Soon afterwards, Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that, following the success of the idea of independence for the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England as a means of gaining trust in its interest-rate decisions, a form of independence should be applied to ONS so that its data could also gain public trust. ONS is now accountable to Parliament via a Statistics Board, known as the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), rather than, as previously, via a Treasury minister. Following the implementation of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the role of Registrar-General for England and Wales, an ancient additional title, held by the National Statistician since the inception of ONS, was transferred, with the General Register Office for England and Wales, which she also headed, to the Identification and Passport Service in the Home Office =Controversy= A government policy inherited by Karen Dunnell as National Statistician aroused controversy. Following the efficiency reviews initiated by the Chancellor and Prime Minister (viz. Review of Public Sector Relocation by Sir Michael Lyons, 2003‚Äì04, and Releasing Resources to the Front Line, Sir Peter Gershon, 2004), the government adopted a policy, criticised by unions, of dispersal of certain public service posts and functions out of London.Independent Review of public sector relocation , H. M. Treasury, 9 July 2004Releasing resources for the frontline: Independent Review of Public Sector Efficiency , H. M. Treasury, 12 July 2004 The policy was initially applied to ONS during Len Cook's tenure as National Statistician but after Karen Dunnell succeeded to the post, ONS accelerated the policy of relocating the Office for National Statistics away from London and concentrating staff in its offices in Titchfield, near Southampton, and in Newport, South Wales, to which the ONS headquarters has moved. The announcement, in January 2007, of the almost complete closure of the ONS's London offices by 2010 reversed a decision to retain a sizeable office in the capital.\\"Fears for quality as statisticians scatter\\", Financial Times, 30 May 2007. Retrieved 5 June 2007.\\"ONS set to close down London HQ\\", BBC news report, 16 January 2007. Retrieved 9 June 2007. This relocation policy, together with substantial expenditure cutbacks in recent government spending settlements, resulted in disquiet among London-based staff whose representatives reported morale problems and a high staff turnover rate among staff still in London.Evidence for Treasury Sub Committee Inquiry into the efficiency of the Chancellor‚Äôs Departments , written submission by the FDA (trade union), para. 2.2, 9 May 2007. Retrieved 5 June 2007. To set against the risks to data quality of any loss of expertise, especially among London- based staff who were unwilling to move, including analysts in National Accounts and in health statistics, Ms. Dunnell defended ONS implementation of government policy on civil service relocation. In the face of some Bank of England disquiet, reported in 2007 to the Treasury Select Committee, about risks to economic data quality, combined with opposition from London staff (including a lack of confidence in management expressed in a staff survey highlighted by staff unions), she asserted that the ONS Board had agreed a process of managed and gradual change to take account of these risks, building up expertise in Newport before shifting functions there. She also cited the benefits to the local economy, the skills of existing ONS staff in Newport and access to universities and other resources in the region as well as the benefits of operating key functions from a single location.\\"Statistics officers get the measure of relocation\\", article by Karen Dunnell, Financial Times, 4 June 2007.

The league replaced three regional leagues: the Inter-City League in southern England, the English League North in northern England and the Northern League in Scotland. The league was sponsored by Heineken until 1993 and during this period was best known as the Heineken League. The league changed format several times. The top level Premier Division was formed in 1983, and a second tier Division One was formed in 1986, being split into North and South conferences for the 87/88 and 93/94 seasons. The third tier Division Two was founded in 1987, renamed English Division One the following season and split from the league in 1992 and later dissolved. In 1996 a major reorganization of the league structure led the two remaining divisions to split into different leagues; resulting in the dissolution of the British Hockey League and the creation of the Ice Hockey Superleague to replace the premier division, and the British National League to replace division 1, respectively.

It is sited adjacent to the village of Bishopton in Renfrewshire, Scotland. The factory was built to manufacture the propellant cordite for the British Army and the Royal Air Force. It also later produced cordite for the Royal Navy. The Ministry of Works were responsible for the site. It was the biggest munitions factory the MOD had, with up to 20,000 workers. History The explosives factory opened between December 1940 and April 1941. It was one of three propellant factories built for the MOD. The others were ROF Wrexham and ROF Ranskill. Manufacturing survived on parts of the Bishopton site until 2002. The site is now owned by BAE Systems, who in conjunction with Redrow Homes, have submitted locally controversial proposals to use the site for building new housing. This development is now underway and is known as Dargavel Village. Site =Location= The Grade B listed Dargavel House The site was built on farm land acquired by compulsory purchase order. Over of land from up to seven farms was used to accommodate the factory. The land included the Grade B listed Dargavel House and its grounds once owned by the entrepreneur Edward Steinkopff; the house still survives within the site boundary, as well as several former farm houses and public roads that were absorbed into the ROF site. The southern end of the site included land occupied by the former National Filling Factory (a WW1 munitions factory). Much of the site lies around 10 metres elevation. This was one of the deciding factors for its location, as UK explosives factories were built near to sea level to take account of their favourable microclimates. Some of the site's high-grounds were used for the nitroglycerin hills. Another reason this site was chosen was because of the area's high unemployment rate in the 1920s and 1930s. This meant there was a ready supply of female labour available to work in the factory. Nearby railway links also played a part in locating the factory at Bishopton. The site consisted of three, almost self-contained explosive-manufacturing factories; with a common administration group and workshop support service. Building work on the first factory started in April 1937, the second started in April 1939 and the third in October 1939. There was a long delay in opening the first factory due to the critical shortage of a guaranteed water supply. The site has three separate water mains: fire fighting, process water and drinking water. A guaranteed supply of about ten million gallons per day was required. =Factory 0= One of the many posters encouraging woman to work in the factories during the war Every building on the site was numbered; one part of the number code indicated if the building was assigned to Factory 0, 1, 2 or 3. The non-explosive sectors of the site were housed in Factory 0 (mostly nearest to Bishopton itself). Factory 0 contained most of the supporting services for the site. A permanently manned fire station with its own fire brigade; clothing department, general stores, laboratories, machine shops, general workshops, laundry, leather workshop, chemical plumber's workshop, carpenter's workshop, and ammunition box stores. It also housed the administration block, a few of the site's many canteens, ambulance station, medical centre, mortuary and the motor transport section. =Factories I, II and III= Factories I, II and III each had their own coal- fired power stations for producing high-pressure steam for generating electricity using steam-turbine-alternators; with the resulting low pressure steam used for site heating and cordite drying. The three power-stations were also interlinked by high-pressure steam mains. Each factory had three nitroglycerin hills, operating on a batch process, to produce nitroglycerin. Factories I and II (and possibly III) had their own nitration plants for making nitrocellulose. Nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose were then processed to produce cordite. Nearly all the buildings, with the exception of the buildings on the nitroglycerin hills which were light-weight, were steel framed buildings with triple-brick walls and bomb-proof reinforced concrete roofs. Some of the buildings in factory III, which was built last, such as the power station, were clad with corrugated iron to reduce costs. ROF Bishopton had an RDX plant installed at the site during World War II. The plant was declared redundant to requirements and was dismantled in 1950. It was apparently shipped to Australia and re-erected. Included within the site boundary was an armoured fighting vehicle storage compound. This was linked to the REME repair factory at Linwood. =Railways= The southern end of the site near the River Gryfe was connected to what was then the LMS former Caledonian Railway line. The connection, just north of the former Georgetown railway station, dated back to World War I and the Georgetown Filling Factory. The railway connection was probably severed and the rail tracks lifted when the Inverclyde Line was electrified in the 1960s. Within ROF Bishopton's perimeter fence this line was still there in the 1990s, albeit with 20- to 30-year-old trees growing between the sleepers and rails. There was also a link from the ROF railway line to the Inverclyde line. The factory had transfer sidings connected to both the up and down lines. The ROF line, which was never electrified, ran on to the transfer sidings a few yards west from the Bishopton station. It crossed Ingleston Road via a gated level crossing, entering the ROF site from the north. The link remained in-situ up until closure of the factory, but was little used after the early 1990s. There was about of standard gauge railway line within the perimeter fence. The factory had its own fleet of nitric acid wagons and diesel shunting locomotives. The latter were used to move wagons between the transfer sidings and various locations within the site. In addition, ROF Bishopton had some of narrow gauge railway lines for transporting explosives around the site. There was a large fleet of rolling stock and a specialist workshop for maintenance of the locomotives, which were kept in excellent mechanical condition. Much of Bishopton‚Äôs narrow gauge railway equipment still exists, and can be seen at locations such as the Almond Valley Light Railway (six assorted locomotives) and the Amberley Museum Railway (locomotive No. 12 and several wagons). =Housing= Housing to accommodate the Ministry of Defence Police was provided locally in Bishopton. Two streets were built to provide housing for married police officers - Holmpark and Rossland Crescent. For unmarried police, accommodation was built adjacent to Holmpark; it was used from the 1970s onwards as the MOD Police social club. Some prefabricated houses were also built in Rossland Crescent, but these have since been demolished. Houses for essential staff, such as managers who needed to be on call, were provided on Poplar Avenue. Ingleston Drive may possibly have been built for ROF workers also. A hostel for single women workers was built in Oakshaw Street, Paisley, by the Ministry of Labour. Privatisation The workforce fell from about 3,000 in the late 1970s to 2,000 at the time of privatisation in 1984. British Aerospace in 1987 bought the Royal Ordnance Factories. During the 1990s, significant investment was made to the site automating its nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine manufacturing plants which improved manufacturing capabilities and process safety. Prior to its closure the site was producing gun and rocket propellant for use in numerous weapons systems. The workforce was about 1,000 in 1991 and was reduced to about 600 in 1993. There was a further reduction in 1996 to 450 employees as the business tried to reduce costs. It was announced in 1998 that the site would close after the loss of a major government contract for the supply of 155mm ammunition to the South African defence contractor, Denel. Manufacture on the site ceased in June 2002. The MOD Fire Service moved out after privatisation; and the MOD Police moved out after the sale to British Aerospace. Their former social club at Holmpark, with its adjoining sports field, became part of facilities of Bishopton village. The former MOD Police houses at both Holmpark and Rossland Crescent were retained by the Ministry of Defence and were sold off in the mid-1980s to private buyers. As they were still connected to ROF Bishopton's sewage system and water supply they had to be connected to the public systems before they could be sold. BAE Systems is the current owner of the site. They house a small Environmental Test Facility and Gun Propulsion laboratory at Bishopton. The rest of the ground is being developed into housing. References External links * Cocroft, Wayne (2000).

It is a City of Pittsburgh historic landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The gardens were founded in 1893 by steel and real-estate magnate Henry Phipps as a gift to the City of Pittsburgh. Its purpose is to educate and entertain the people of Pittsburgh with formal gardens (Roman, English, etc.) and various species of exotic plants (palm trees, succulents, bonsai, orchids, etc.). Currently, the facilities house elaborate gardens within the fourteen room conservatory itself and on the adjoining grounds. In addition to its primary flora exhibits, the sophisticated glass and metalwork of the Lord & Burnham conservatory offers an interesting example of Victorian greenhouse architecture. Phipps is one of the \\"greenest\\" facilities in the world. The entrance pavilion of the Phipps Conservatory has silver-level LEED certification. Its greenhouse production facility has received Platinum certification, the first and only greenhouse to be so certified. Moreover, the Center for Sustainable Landscapes, designed to be as environmentally sustainable as possible, is also LEED Platinum certified, and produces all of its own energy.  History  The Conservatory in 1893 The Phipps Conservatory was founded in 1893 as a gift from Henry Phipps, Jr. to the City of Pittsburgh. The Conservatory was designed by Lord & Burnham, for a fee of $100,000. The glasshouse, then consisting of nine display rooms, was completed in August 1893, one year after construction began. On December 7, 1893, the Phipps Conservatory was opened to the public, displaying many plants from the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A postcard postmarked 1915 illustrates the Aquatic Garden. Sometime after 1910, the first of the Aquatic Gardens was built. A second pool would be installed in 1939. In 1970, the Conservatory was declared a Historic Landmark by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. In 1976, the Phipps Conservatory was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993, the Phipps Conservatory, which had been run by the City of Pittsburgh since 1893, became a privately managed, while city owned, non-profit organization. In October 2003, Phipps announced an expansion project. The first phase, a green engineered Welcome Center topped by a neo-Victorian dome, was designed by IKM Incorporated, and completed in 2005. The Production Greenhouses and a Tropical Forest Conservatory were completed in 2006. Chihuly chandelier. The Tropical Forest conservatory has a different theme every three years, beginning with the country of Thailand. In addition to a \\"Research Forest Station\\" and a \\"Healer's Hut\\" (designed to educate visitors about various cultural topics), there are two waterfalls, several bridges, a stream, and a wide variety of plants from bamboo, orchids and frangipani to plants of economic, cultural, and horticultural value to the people of Thailand. The second theme is \\"Headwaters of the Amazon,\\" which opened in early 2009. An example of a Dale Chihuly art glass installation at the Phipps Conservatory in 2007 In 2007, Phipps teamed with glass artist Dale Chihuly and his Tacoma-based team of glass blowers. They worked together to create a marriage of hand-blown glass and living plants. Following the closing of the exhibit in February, the conservatory retained four prominent pieces (the Welcome Center chandelier, the hanging gold star in the Desert Room, the celadon and purple gilded Fiori in the Tropical Fruit and Spice Room and the bronze, apricot and chartreuse Ikebana in the Palm Court) and subsequently purchased 26 smaller pieces for its permanent collection including six multicolored Macchia (wavy, shell-like bowls), thirteen amber Cattails and seven Paintbrushes, all of which are installed in the Palm Court. The total Chihuly collection is valued at $1.2 million.PG: Chihuly works will become permanent fixtures at Phipps, July 10, 2008 In 2009, Phipps teamed with another glass artist Hans Godo Frabel to create another stunning exhibit titled \\"Gardens and Glass.\\" Unlike the Chihuly pieces, Frabel's work is more realistic, although still whimsical at times. Highlights of this exhibit include Longfellows, intricate glass orchid and lotus plants and various clowns (balancing on either glass playing cards or colored glass balls.) This collaboration was on display until January 2010.  Indoor Gardens  = Palm Court = Paper cranes on display in the Palm Court The Palm Court is the first room visitors see after entering the Conservatory through the main entrance. The Victorian-inspired room contains many species of palm trees. The room contains the original dated plaque from the Conservatory's opening as well as numerous glass installations by Dale Chihuly. To accommodate the palm trees, the Palm Court has a high glass peak. The original wood and annealed glass in the Palm Court had deteriorated to a point for the need of emergency stabilization in 2008. Renovations began in 1992 and included replacing the upper wood and glass vent sash with aluminum and safety glass, and replacing the vertical wood and glass components with new replicated aluminum extrusions and safety glass glazing to match the original specifications exactly. = Serpentine Room = The Serpentine Room during the winter flower show The Serpentine Room is located west of the Palm Court, connecting it to the Fern Room. The exhibits in the room change with the season for different shows and special exhibits. The room is named for its curved brick-walled pathway. Plants are lined along either side of the pathway, as well as suspended from the peaked ceiling. The room was originally known as the Border Garden, which was redesigned as the present-day Serpentine Room during an 18-month period of extensive renovations starting in 1978. = Fern Room = Encephalartos ferox in the Fern Room. It produces a large red cone once every five or six years. The Fern Room is located in the west wing at the intersection of the Serpentine Room, the Orchid Room, and the Stove Room. The room contains many ferns, as well as cycads and other ground plants on which ferns commonly grow. The dominant species in the room are representative of the Triassic, during which ferns and cycads were common as flowering plants would not evolve until millennia later.

As of 2015, the region features the Tropical Forest Congo exhibit. The Tropical Forest Conservatory opened on December 6, 2006. The Tropical Forest Conservatory has several interesting features, which make it extremely energy-efficient. It has \\"earth tubes\\" running underground to help cool the tropical forest and a solid oxide fuel cell, which efficiently produces 5 kW of electricity from natural gas. In addition, there are computer-controlled shades that block excess sunlight from entering the structure and also help to insulate it at night. The roof is also computer- controlled and many of the glass panes can be opened. = Gallery Room = The farmer's market at the Gallery Room The Gallery Room is located east of the South Conservatory. The room contains didactic displays for children, such as the imaginary farmer's market, where children can play and learn about healthy food.

The garden is modelled after the formal gardens of French chateaux during the reign of Louis XIV, and is a popular setting for wedding ceremonies and photo shoots. The room opened in 1939 and was originally called the Cloister Garden. In 1966, the room was redesigned as the present-day Broderie Room. = East Room = The Japanese garden installation in the East Room The East Room is located in the north part of the east wing. The room contains streams and waterfalls. The displays change with season.  Outdoor Gardens  = Rooftop Edible Garden = The Rooftop Edible Garden The Rooftop Edible Garden is located between the Desert Room and the Tropical Forest Conservatory.

The garden contains many smaller gardens and plant collections, including an herb garden, a medicinal garden, perennials, ferns and dwarf conifers. The original hardscape was constructed by Works Progress Administration in 1935 and persists to this day. The garden was originally known as the Perennial Garden, which was transformed into the Outdoor Garden in 1986. = Botany Hall = The Phipps Hall of Botany The Botany Hall, across from Panther Hollow Bridge, features a small garden containing walkways, curved benches, and a fountain. The Botany Hall was funded, in 1901, by Henry Phipps to be used by local teachers looking to enhance class trips to the glasshouse. It was renovated in the late 1990s and continues to serve as a site for many educational programs and events. = Aquatic Garden = The Aquatic Garden The Aquatic garden is located on the east side of the Conservatory outside of the Victoria Room. During the summer, the two pools are filled with tropical water plants and floating flora. One of the pools features a statue of Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, which was presented to Phipps shortly after the conservatory opened in 1893. The northern pool was constructed sometime between 1910 and 1915, and the southern one was added in 1939.  Center for Sustainable Landscapes  The Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) is a building on the Conservatory grounds, located south of the Tropical Forest Conservatory, that is designed to be environmentally sustainable. Opened in December 2012, the building produces all of its own energy and treats and reuses all water captured on site. The exhibits in the building include informational signs, an interactive kiosk, and art exhibits. The building also contains a classroom for children. The CSL has received a Platinum LEED certification along with fulfilling the Living Building Challenge for net-zero energy, Additionally, the CSL is the first and only building to receive Four Stars Sustainable SITES Initiative certification for landscaping projects. These honors and certifications make the CSL one of the 'greenest' buildings in the world. { The Center for Sustainable Landscapes Water capture and treatment at the Center for Sustainable Landscapes Solar panels at the Center for Sustainable Landscapes }  See also  * List of botanical gardens and arboretums in Pennsylvania  References  *  External links  * Category:Schenley Park Category:Botanical gardens in Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures in Pittsburgh Category:Greenhouses in Pennsylvania Category:City of Pittsburgh historic designations Category:Agricultural buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pittsburgh Category:Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1893 Category:Protected areas established in 1893 Category:1893 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design basic silver certified buildings Category:Parks in Pittsburgh Category:Phipps family Category:Tourist attractions in Pittsburgh ","title":"Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens"},{"id":"2377025","text":"The Sine Macula Choir was founded in 1983 by its present director, Tony Pace, on the initiative of Parish-Priest Fr.

Thriving on enthusiasm and sheer love of music, the Sine Macula Choir has evolved into an interesting ensemble, promoting musical culture among its members and the various audiences who have listened to its concerts. In its 25 years of existence, the Sine Macula Choir has sung in more than three-quarters of Maltese and Gozitan churches, and has participated three times in the Malta International Choir Festival. The Choir twice ventured abroad: in 1992 it was invited to Ulm, Germany and in December 2001, the Choir gave concerts in Trecastagni, Sicily. Singing in SATB formation, the Choir takes part in various activities. It sings during liturgical and band services in many Maltese festas. It has sung oratorios, has recorded various CDs, sings during weddings and other private functions, and generally takes part in any type of activity to which it is invited. The choir boasts a vast repertoire which ranges from religious and sacred music to music from films, oratorios, etc. Although based in Safi, the choir has members from other villages too. What attracts these singers to this choir is the friendly atmosphere created by around 30 choristers who come from all walks of life and whose ages span 3 generations.

Shi Hengxia is often referred to as frjj, short for \\"Furong Jiejie\\", which literally means \\"Sister Lotus\\". Name Shi Hengxia is better known by her nickname, F√∫r√≥ng Jiƒõjiƒõ () in Chinese, which could be translated partially as Sister Furong or fully as Sister Lotus (Flower) or Sister (cotton-rose) Hibiscus (Flower) in English. \\"'ËäôËìâ' is the Chinese name for a flower which has always been used to describe young beauty.\\"Stepping into a painting roll Fame Sister Furong \\"did not have an easy time with the country's college entrance system. It took her three tries to get into college, and since graduation, she has set her eyes on two of the country's best schools.\\"Hibuscus blooms‚Äô and creates a buzz on the Net Over several years, she tried but failed to gain entrance to either of two top Beijing universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University) for postgraduate studies. She posted the story of her determination and pictures of herself on the Internet bulletin boards of those universities and touched a nerve among students.Ego pays off She responded to the attention by adding a quest for a boyfriend to her postings. Her narcissistic self descriptions provoked controversy and the question, \\"Is she funny simply because she doesn't know she is?\\". Sister Furong‚Äôs popularity is indicative of the growing trend of Chinese female bloggers (such as Liu Mang Yan and Mu Zimei) who have become famous for talking openly about sex and relationships in a culture still considered sexually repressive. Sister Furong is a self- proclaimed dance expert, and has danced in many television and public appearances.Hush! BBStar Sister Furong is 'daydreaming' Her signature pose is the ‚ÄúS-figure,‚Äù in which she bends her knees and thrusts out her chest provocatively. There was blanket coverage in early 2005 by newspapers, magazines and television about her, but since then, media coverage of Furong Jiejie has largely died down, partially due to pressure from the Chinese government‚Äôs Propaganda Department. Other forms of media in China are predominantly local rather than national, making the Internet an even more popular tool for staying current with events happening across the country. Such was the case with Furong Jiejie, whose popularity arose within the Internet community. Both the government and traditional media outlets did not pick up on her story until much later. Expert Commentary Furong Jiejie's celebrity status has attracted commentary from experts in academia and media. Many consider her to be the pioneer of internet celebrity in China, and an embodiment of wider trends in the production of celebrity as individualistic, opportunistic and commodified figures who achieve fame not through merit but via narcissistic self-promotion and increasingly, in the online world of user generated blogs and forums. As I.D Roberts, a China studies scholar and author writes in his book chapter on Furong Jiejie China's Internet Celebrity: Furong Jiejie, her rise to fame is also indicative of contemporary developments in China - with regard to the rise of its internet culture, the nature of state censorship, and the changing cultural standards and social mores of the Chinese public. As Roberts concludes, . Public Response Public reaction to Furong Jiejie is mixed. Some view her as a brave and empowering figure, pushing the boundaries of government censorship and asserting her individuality. Zhang Yiwu, a Peking University specialist in modern culture, explains, ‚ÄúIn one sense, the phenomenon of Sister Lotus is the victory of common people.‚ÄùIn Chinese Cyberspace, A Blossoming Passion However, others question her popularity, wondering how she became an overnight sensation when her fame is based upon what they view as shameless self-humiliation, and criticizing her for being a negative influence on Chinese youth. Government response When her cult status began to sweep the whole country, Beijing authorities acted. In July 2005, authorities told the country's top blog host to move Furong-related content to low-profile parts of the site. Communist party censors also barred the broadcast of a TV program about Sister Lotus prepared by China Central Television, mainland China‚Äôs primary television network. The Chinese government‚Äôs censorship of Sister Furong is part of the growing issue of technology usage in China. According to Chen Changeng, deputy dean of Peking University‚Äôs School of Journalism and Communications, ‚ÄúThe government sees the Internet as vital for China‚Äôs technological progress but, at the same time, they want to stop people from accessing content they see as unhealthy.‚ÄùChina cracks down on the sex bloggers The Chinese government is increasing its efforts to regulate Internet bloggers. On September 24, 2005, China‚Äôs Ministry of Information, Industry and the State Council released regulations that ban the usage of sexually explicit content on the web, a measure which some analysts believe is aimed at bloggers.Chinese women sex bloggers explore new territory, prompt censorship In typical self-praising form, Furong Jiejie responded to the government censorship by saying, ‚ÄúWhen I first heard about it I was really disappointed. My friends all said the government should be encouraging a positive, helpful girl like me.‚ÄùChina Tries to Wipe Internet Icon from Web However, media regulation policies are still being newly developed in China, and as a result, Furong-related Internet activity is sometimes permitted because of ambiguity in media regulation. Future Beijing-based film production company Zongbo Media hired her to star in a series of short films shot on digital video that would be broadcast only online, Zongbo chairman Chen Weiming told Reuters.China Tries to Wipe Internet Icon from Web She quit her job at a publishing house, has auditioned for a soap opera, and says \\"I am preparing for a career as an anchorwoman.\\" Sister Furong recently began writing a book in which she encourages young Chinese to follow her lead and persist despite obstacles. However, there are rumors that her publisher has pulled out of the book deal. On December 29, 2007, she posted on her blog a marriage proposal from the recently divorced French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Many believed that this is simply a hoax, and the timing of the so-called proposal suggests a rivalry between Furong and another Chinese celebrity Yang Erche Namu, given that Yang proposed to Sarkozy just a few days earlier. In July 2008, she held her first live concert in Beijing.

It is named for the late George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. At its west end near Belt Line Road in Irving, State Highway 161 (SH 161) continues southwest to Interstate 20 (I-20) in Grand Prairie. The discontinuous free frontage roads along the turnpike from I-35E in Carrollton east to its end at I-30 in Garland are assigned the State Highway 190 (SH 190) designation. SH 190 signage appears only along the Rowlett, Garland, Richardson, Plano, and Carrollton sections of the frontage road with the undersign \\"frontage road only\\". At intersections with city streets, only the Bush Turnpike signs are displayed, not the SH 190 signage. Prior to the construction of the main lanes as a tollway, SH 190 was used as the name of the planned main lanes too. Similarly, the part west of I-35E was planned as part of SH 161\\\\. Bush Turnpike is signed as a north‚Äìsouth road from I-20 to I-35E (the \\"Western Extension\\"), an east‚Äìwest road from I-35E to the Merritt Main Lane Gantry (the original sections) and as a north‚Äìsouth road from the Merritt Main Lane Gantry to I-30 (the \\"Eastern Extension\\"), as Bush Turnpike makes a nearly 90-degree curve in both places. The turnpike is operated by the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). Currently, all maintenance is done under a five-year total routine maintenance (TRM) contract with Roy Jorgensen Associates, Inc. based in Buckeystown, Maryland, that started in November 2011. The turnpike passes through three Texas counties (Dallas, Collin and Denton) and nine Dallas suburbs (Rowlett, Sachse, Garland, Richardson, Plano, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, and Grand Prairie). Originally the PGBT was equipped with traditional toll plazas for cash payment as well as RFID-based TollTag express lanes. However, on July 1, 2009 the cash plazas were closed and replaced with \\"ZipCash\\", an OCR-based camera system which reads the license plate and bills the owner by mail. This made the turnpike the first in the United States to transition to all-electronic toll collection. The ZipCash rates, however, come at a premium being significantly higher than both the TollTag rate and the earlier cash prices.  History  The corridor of SH 161 and the Turnpike was first proposed as an outer loop within Dallas County in 1957. The 1964 plan was the first to designate it as a freeway, and in 1969 the full loop was added to the state highway system as Loop 9. The loop would begin at Interstate 20 just east of the Tarrant County line and head north (along a corridor still planned as an extension of SH 161). From State Highway 183 it would run roughly along present SH 161, turning north on Belt Line Road and east just south of the Denton County line, crossing Interstate 35E near the present junction. Rather than cross into Denton and Tarrant Counties, the loop would stay in Dallas County, running roughly where Campbell Road is now. It would rejoin the present Turnpike alignment and head southeast to Interstate 30 west of Lake Ray Hubbard. The south part of the loop would continue in a roughly circular route to end at the junction of Interstate 20 and Spur 408, several miles east of the beginning of the loop. The short Spur 484, designated in 1970, would run from Loop 9 at Belt Line Road northeast along the present Turnpike alignment to Interstate 635. Some of the opposition to the loop came from the city of Richardson, which was already divided by the Central Expressway. In conjunction with Plano, the city acquired empty right-of-way about two miles (3 km) to the north, where the Turnpike now runs, and set the centerline of the right-of-way to the border between Richardson and Plano. Loop 9 was cancelled on October 1, 1977, and the western and northern section was split between two new designations: State Highway 161 from Interstate 20 to State Highway 114 (at Belt Line Road) and State Highway 190 from Interstate 35E to State Highway 78. (The piece between SH 114 and IH 35E was removed from the state highway system.) Spur 484 was absorbed into SH 161 on October 31, 1979, making its northern terminus Interstate 635 (at Valley View Lane). The connection between I-635 and I-35E was added to SH 161 on August 30, 1988. A turnoff to the George Bush Turnpike in Irving, Texas from SH 183Construction on service roads began in late 1988 in north Garland and Richardson. A stack interchange was constructed in 1990 at U.S. Highway 75 in Richardson, which quickly became a white elephant as the structure remained abandoned for several years. On January 29, 1991, SH 190 was extended to I-20. In 1995 following a revision in federal laws, authorities agreed to shift to a toll financing scheme, providing an infusion of cash and new construction. The SH 190 designation was removed from the plans for the not-yet-constructed main lanes on October 26, 1995, and SH 190 was truncated to SH 78. and on April 30, 1998 SH 161 was removed from the piece between Belt Line Road and I-635 (Segment V). On April 26, 2007, SH 190 extended to I-30. SH 161 was also the name of a route designated on March 19, 1930 from Clairemont southeastward to SH 70 near Rotan as a renumbering of SH 84A. That route was transferred to SH 70 on December 1, 1930, but was not cancelled until January 22, 1931. SH 190 was also the name of a route designated on November 30, 1932 from Cuero southwestward to SH 119. That route was transferred to SH 29 on March 13, 1934. At Dallas North Tollway, the interchange had been built in 1994 ready for the turnpike to be built in 1998. In late December of 2015, the PGBT and the I-30 interchange was directly hit by a large, EF4 tornado with winds of up to 180 mph while at peak strength at around 6:52pm CDT. The tornado lofted several cars driving on the interchange bridges and threw them several hundred yards, with some of the cars being found in Lake Ray Hubbard in the following weeks. Multiple cars were mangled beyond recognition and several fatalities occurred on the interchange.  Description  The stack interchange between PGBT (upper level, top to bottom) and Central Expressway (lower level, left to right). Since the initial construction began in 1988, the turnpike was completed in a number of phases, as described here: Segment I (North Dallas). Extends from Campbell Road to Midway Road, and includes the Dallas North Tollway and U.S. Highway 75 (Central Expressway) interchanges. Opened in December 1998 (Midway Road to Preston Road) and December 1999 (Preston Road to Campbell Road). Segment II (Garland/Richardson). Extends from Campbell Road to State Highway 78. Opened in 2000. Segment III (Carrollton). Extends from Midway Road in north Dallas to Interstate 35E. Opened July 2001. Segment IV (\\"PGBT Superconnector\\"). Connects I-35E to the I-635 airport extension. It covers and was built at the cost of $339 million. Much of the expense is because the segment is built within the Trinity River wetland and comprises many miles of bridges. Construction began in January 2003 and was completed in October 2005. Segment V (Irving). A segment connecting the I-635 airport extension to the SH 161 freeway near Belt Line Road. It opened in December 2001. Unstable clay soil was a significant problem in this segment, requiring contractors to use concentrated liquid stabilizers and geosynthetic reinforcement. A part of President George Bush Turnpike was extended from SH 183 to Conflans Road in 2006. Segment VI (\\"Western Extension\\", Irving/Grand Prairie). A extension south from SH-183 in Irving to I-30 in Grand Prairie. A portion of the Western Extension, from SH-183 to I-30 in Grand Prairie, opened in August 2009. The remaining of the Western Extension, from I-30 to I-20 in Grand Prairie, opened in October 2012. Segment VII (\\"Eastern Extension\\", Garland/Sachse/Rowlett). A extension from SH-78 in Garland, through Rowlett and Sachse, and back into Garland at I-30. The project, with a price tag of $1.04 billion, included construction of a 1-mile bridge at Lake Ray Hubbard. Construction began in October 2008, and the Eastern Extension opened to traffic on December 21, 2011. Segment VIII (\\"East Branch\\", Garland/Mesquite). A proposed extension from I-30 in Garland to I-20 in Mesquite, with an estimated cost of $730 million. In December 2015 an Environmental Impact Statement for the East Branch had been prepared but the review process was restarted in 2017. Construction is not expected until 2026.  Expansion plans  The next PGBT segment, the East Branch extension, is planned to begin at the PGBT Lake Ray Hubbard Interchange at I-30, extending south-southeast to near Duck Creek Way, then southward near Mesquite Metro Airport, terminating at I-20 near Rory Galloway Day Camp. The project is well into the planning stages, and an Environmental Impact Statement was under preparation . In May 2017 at a Dallas city council meeting it was stated TxDOT had restarted the environmental impact statement review process. Construction is not expected until 2026. In the longer term, the North Central Texas Council of Governments is studying a very broad outer loop around the entire Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Assuming it receives environmental clearance, funding, and political support, much of it would be completed in the 2020s or 2030s. The PGBT is not part of this outer loop, but the PGBT East Branch alignment was closely coordinated with the loop's master plan. The segment of the proposed outer loop through southern Dallas County would be known as Loop 9 and would likely be the first segment to be built.

(1985). Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater. Cornwell Books. p. 177. Biography Born in Marshalltown, Iowa, he was the youngest of six children in the family of Thomas and Cordelia Downs. His family moved to Iowa from the New York state. Downs' father, the Marshall county superintendent, died when his son was not even a year old. Downs never took any training in magic; all his tricks were self-taught. By the age of 12, he became an expert in card and coin manipulation. He further mastered his skills by the age of 17, when he took a job as a railway telegrapher and had plenty of time to practice with coins.Christopher, Milbourne. (1996). The Illustrated History of Magic. Greentrwood Publishing Group. p. 275. In September 1895, Downs decided to quit his telegraphy job and launch a career in magic. At first, he toured Iowa with his partner, Sam Spiegel, a mandolinist. By 1897, Downs concentrated only on the coin tricks ‚Äî a rare specialization at that time, and established himself in vaudeville, which was a popular avenue for magicians. The success of Downs career allowed him to get booked into Tony Pastor's New York theatre, and to London's Palace Theatre soon after that. At the peak of his career, Downs travelled frequently, and performed at royal courts. While performing his tricks, he could palm up to 60 coins at a time. One of his most famous tricks was \\"The Miser's Dream\\", in which he seemed to pull countless coins out of the thin air. In 1912, at the age of 42, Downs decided to retire in Iowa. After moving back to Marshalltown, he rarely left the area. Not quite comfortable with idle retirement, Downs kept busy by opening a vaudeville house on Main Street, a few blocks from his own home at 7 South 3rd Avenue. He also sold a line of magic equipment. Many visitors, other magicians, streamed to his home to share gossip and the latest tricks as well as to brush elbows with the famous sleight of hand artist. The most famous of these visitors included Chung Ling Soo (William Robinson) and Dai Vernon. Downs was a friend with the magician Harry Houdini, however, both were involved in an intense rivalry in private. Houdini had stated that Downs had operated a \\"fake magic shop\\" and was in trouble with the federal government for a \\"swindle.\\"Silverman, Kenneth. (1996). Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss. HarperCollins Publishers. p. 75. \\"Houdini talked magic hours on end with his friend T. Nelson Downs (1867-1938), renowned for his palming ‚Äî \\"one of the Historical lights of magic,\\" Houdini called him. It was Downs who pioneered the magic specialty act, snatching silver from thin air as King of Koins. A midwesterner by birth, Downs like several other magicians had matured on the shady side of the law. According to Houdini, he had run a \\"fake Magic Shop,\\" worked for a \\"fake spiritualist,\\" and been wanted by the federal government for a \\"swindle.\\" Houdini stayed friendly with these and many other magicians. But except in Downs 's case, a globe-covering sense of rivalry usually led him to belittle them in private.\\" By 1896, Downs had campaigned against spiritualism, this was before Houdini's crusade against fraudulent spiritualists. In his letters, Downs claimed to have performed a stage escape from handcuffs several years before Houdini. He also took issue with Houdini's self-advertisement.Rosheim, Mark. Introduction. In Thomas Nelson Downs. (1999, reprint). Classic Coin Tricks: An Unabridged Reprint of Modern Coin Manipulation. Dover Publications. p. 18. Downs wrote several books on magic before and after his retirement. His first book, Modern Coin Manipulation, was published in 1900 and is still issued in reprints today. His other books include Tricks with Coins (1902) and The Art of Magic (1909). Downs was married twice. He had a son in his first marriage with Nellie Stone, who died in childbirth in 1895. He subsequently married Harriett Rocky on June 3, 1905. He retired around 1928. In 1935 he was honored with a testimonial dinner. Death Downs died on September 11, 1938 in Marshalltown, Iowa. He had suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Marshalltown. His gravestone reads \\"King of Koins\\".

A land parcel or cadastral parcel is defined as \\"a continuous area, or more appropriately volume, that is identified by a unique set of homogeneous property rights\\".Peter Dale and John McLaughlin (2000), Land Administration, Oxford University Press, 186 pages. In the United States, Cadastral Survey within the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) maintains records of all public lands. Such surveys often require detailed investigation of the history of land use, legal accounts, and other documents. The cadastre is a fundamental source of data in disputes and lawsuits between landowners. Land registration and cadastre are both types of land recording and complement each other.  Definition  A cadastre commonly includes details of the ownership, the tenure, the precise location (therefore GNSS coordinates are not used due to errors such as multipath), the dimensions (and area), the cultivations if rural, and the value of individual parcels of land. Cadastres are used by many nations around the world, some in conjunction with other records, such as a title register.\\"Cadastral Template - Field Data C4\\" (lists nations), CadastralTemplate.org, January 2008, webpage: CT-C4 : also has term \\"cadastral survey\\" and other land records. The International Federation of Surveyors defines cadastre as follows:FIG (1995) \\"The FIG Statement on the Cadastre\\", FIG Policy Statement, The International Federation of Surveyors (FIG), FIG PUBLICATION No 11, 1995, fig.net > A Cadastre is normally a parcel based, and up-to-date land information > system containing a record of interests in land (e.g. rights, restrictions > and responsibilities). It usually includes a geometric description of land > parcels linked to other records describing the nature of the interests, the > ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel > and its improvements. Etymology The word cadastre came into English through French from the Greek (), a list or register, from ()--literally, \\"(organised) line by line\\". History A cadastre text written in Akkadian on a terracotta tablet. From the 18th century BC in Sippar, Iraq, and held by the Ancient Orient Museum, Istanbul Cadastre survey marker from the South Tyrol mountains, 2018 Some of the earliest cadastres were ordered by Roman Emperors to recover state owned lands that had been appropriated by private individuals, and thereby recover income from such holdings. One such cadastre was done in AD 77 in Campania, a surviving stone marker of the survey reads \\"The Emperor Vespasian, in the eighth year of his tribunician power, so as to restore the state lands which the Emperor Augustus had given to the soldiers of Legion II Gallica, but which for some years had been occupied by private individuals, ordered a survey map to be set up with a record on each 'century' of the annual rental\\". In this way Vespasian was able to reimpose taxation formerly uncollected on these lands. With the fall of Rome the use of cadastral maps effectively discontinued. Medieval practice used written descriptions of the extent of land rather than using more precise surveys. Only in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries did the use of cadastral maps resume, beginning in the Netherlands. With the emergence of capitalism in Renaissance Europe the need for cadastral maps reemerged as a tool to determine and express control of land as a means of production. This took place first privately in land disputes and later spread to governmental practice as a means of more precise tax assessment. Surveys BLM cadastral survey marker from 1992 in San Xavier, Arizona Cadastral surveys document the boundaries of land ownership, by the production of documents, diagrams, sketches, plans (plats in the US), charts, and maps. They were originally used to ensure reliable facts for land valuation and taxation. An example from early England is the Domesday Book in 1086. Napoleon established a comprehensive cadastral system for France that is regarded as the forerunner of most modern versions. The Public Lands Survey System is a cadastral survey of the United States originating in legislation from 1785, after international recognition of the United States. The Dominion Land Survey is a similar cadastral survey conducted in Western Canada begun in 1871 after the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Both cadastral surveys are made relative to principal meridian and baselines. These cadastral surveys divided the surveyed areas into townships, square land areas of approximately 36 square miles (six miles by six miles; some very early surveys in Ohio created 25 square mile townships when the design of the system was being explored). These townships are divided into sections, each approximately one-mile square. Unlike in Europe this cadastral survey largely preceded settlement and as a result greatly influenced settlement patterns. Properties are generally rectangular, boundary lines often run on cardinal bearings, and parcel dimensions are often in fractions or multiples of chains. Land descriptions in Western North America are principally based on these land surveys. Cadastral survey information is often a base element in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or Land Information Systems (LIS) used to assess and manage land and built infrastructure. Such systems are also employed on a variety of other tasks, for example, to track long-term changes over time for geological or ecological studies, where land tenure is a significant part of the scenario. Map A cadastral map is a map that shows the boundaries and ownership of land parcels. Some cadastral maps show additional details, such as survey district names, unique identifying numbers for parcels, certificate of title numbers, positions of existing structures, section or lot numbers and their respective areas, adjoining and adjacent street names, selected boundary dimensions and references to prior maps.

Accessed: 4 February 2011. Documentation Cadastral documentation comprises the documentary materials submitted to cadastre or land administration offices for renewal of cadastral recordings. Cadastral documentation is kept in paper and/or electronic form. Jurisdiction statutes and further provisions specify the content and form of the documentation, as well as the person(s) authorized to prepare and sign the documentation, including concerned parties (owner, etc.), licensed surveyors and legal advisors. The office concerned reviews the submitted information; if the documentation does not comply with stated provisions, the office may set a deadline for the applicant to submit complete documentation.Shala, X., Meha, M. and Ahmedi, S.

History =Combat Group Juliet= General Constand Viljoen, Chief of the Army, formulated a plan in 1978 to introduce a mechanized combat group to Ovamboland in the then South West Africa, to conduct operations against SWAPO. Combat Group Juliet was then formed under the command of Commandant Frank Bestbier. SADF temporary vehicle marker for Combat Group Juliet =Operation Reindeer= The Battle Group first saw action in Operation Reindeer in early May 1978, launching an attack on SWAPO‚Äôs Western Front headquarters and logistics base, at Chetequera, 15 km north of the South West African border, with a mechanized assault force. This attack formed part of Operation Reindeer during which paratroopers attacked a separate target at Cassinga, some 300 km into Angola. After Operation Reindeer it was decided to establish a permanent conventional mechanized combat unit in the operational area and Commandant Johann Dippenaar was appointed to set up this unit. By January 1979, the Battle Group was renamed 61 Mechanised Battalion and became part of the regular order of battle. 61 Mech served for over a decade in the territory fighting both a guerrilla war against the South-West Africa People's Organisation, as well as taking part in conventional operations against Cuban and Angolan forces. =South West Africa Headquarters of 61 Mech= A tactical headquarters for 61 Mech was initially established at Otavi but during April 1979 this was moved to Tsumeb. 61 Mech was eventually resettled at Omuthiya, with a base headquarters in Tsumeb. Further operations 61 Mech was primarily involved in these operations. * Operation Carrot (1979) * Operation Sceptic (1980) * Operation Protea (1981) * Operation Daisy (1981) * Operation Meebos (1982) * Operation Yahoo (1982) * Operation Dolfyn (1983) * Operation Askari (1983) * Operation Vasvat (1984) * Operation Nekomdraai (1984) * Operation Pronkertjie (1985) * Operation Viper (1985) * Operation Benzine * Operation Moduler * Operation Hooper * Operation Packer * Operation Excite (1988) * Operation Linger * Operation Merlyn (1989) * Operation Arson I * Operation Arson II * Operation Light Foot * Operation Ventic * Operation Pikadel * Operation Reward * Operation Displace * Operation Jamba * Operation Hulti (1988) * Operation Prone (1988) * Operation Makro (1981) SADF Operation Sceptic Commemorative medallion SADF Operation Hooper participation bar 61 Mech was part of the Sector 10 response to the Cuban buildup and SWAPO incursions, known as the Merlyn Forces in 1989 South West Africa =Relocation to South Africa and Lohatla Army Battle School= During September 1991 61 Mech Bn Gp, which was based at Rooikop in Namibia, resettled at the Army Battle School in Lohatla, South Africa. 61 Mech remained part of C Army‚Äôs Reserve, under operational command of 60 Brigade HQ and administratively supported by the Army Battle School. During this time, C Army amended the organisation of the Battle School to execute two functions concurrently: * first, continuing to administer the facility as a large training institution for reserves and full-time forces as it had been in the past; * second, to provide the headquarters for a virtual Rapid Deployment Force (including 61 Mech), as part of its permanent order of battle. Operations after relocation 61 Mech was primarily involved in these operations. * Operation Shobashobane * Operation Intexo (1995) * Operation Jumbo III (1996) * Operation Vlakhaas (1995) * Operation Sweepslag (1994) * Operation Sombre (1994) =Disbandment= By 2005, 61 Mech was disbanded and its infantry elements merged into 8 South African Infantry Battalion at Upington after moving from Lohatla. The Armour and Artillery components were merged into other existing regular units of their respective corps. Organisation 61 Mech was organised along the following lines: * two infantry companies, which were equipped with the Ratel-20 Infantry Fighting Vehicle, * if necessary, a third infantry company was attached. On many occasions this was a company from 1 Parachute Battalion who were attached as a motorised company in Buffels * an armoured car squadron initially equipped with Eland Armoured Cars. During 1980 the Elands were replaced by the Ratel-90 and later the Rooikat Armoured Fighting Vehicle, * a support company consisting of an anti-tank platoon in Ratel-90s, * an 81mm mortar platoon in Ratel-81s, * an anti-aircraft troop and * an artillery battery equipped with the G5 howitzer. Firepower was further augmented by the addition of the self- propelled version (G6 Rhino). * In 1988 61 Mech also received the first combat-deployed squadron of Olifant MBTs, to counter the ever-escalating FAPLA tank threat 61 Mech was primarily tasked as the Army's Immediate Response Unit, due to its versatility.

The badge had a yellow backing and was awarded initially only for cross border operations into Angola. A subsequent version with a green backing was suggested which was to be for internal duties. This version was never authorised and the yellow badge was awarded for all operational deployments. The badge consisted of a dagger with three diagonal lightning bolts in red across it. A subdued version was produced for wear on nutria (brown's) uniforms. With the introduction of camouflage, a new version was produced on green thatching. This knife point always faced the heart of the wearer. = Companies = Each company or element in the Battalion (group) had its own flag and identifying badge.

Smoke point values can vary greatly, depending on factors such as the volume of oil utilized, the size of the container, the presence of air currents, the type and source of light as well as the quality of the oil and its acidity content, otherwise known as free fatty acid (FFA) content. The more FFA an oil contains, the quicker it will break down and start smoking. The lower in FFA, the higher the smoke point. It is important to consider, however, that the FFA represents typically less than 1% of the total oil and consequently renders smoke point a poor indicator of the capacity of a fat or oil to withstand heat. Temperature The smoke point of an oil correlates with its level of refinement. Many cooking oils have smoke points above standard home cooking temperatures: * Pan frying (saut√©) on stove top heat: 120 ¬∞C (248 ¬∞F) * Deep frying: 160 - 180 ¬∞C (320 ¬∞F - 356 ¬∞F) * Oven baking: Average of 180 ¬∞C (356 ¬∞F) Smoke point decreases at different pace in different oils. Considerably above the temperature of the smoke point is the flash point, the point at which the vapours from the oil can ignite in air, given an ignition source. The following table presents smoke points of various fats and oils.  Oxidative stability  Hydrolysis and oxidation are the two primary degradation processes that occur in an oil during cooking. Oxidative stability is how resistant an oil is to reacting with oxygen, breaking down and potentially producing harmful compounds while exposed to continuous heat. Oxidative stability is the best predictor of how an oil behaves during cooking. The Rancimat method is one of the most common methods for testing oxidative stability in oils. This determination entails speeding up the oxidation process in the oil (under heat and forced air), which enables its stability to be evaluated by monitoring volatile substances associated with rancidity. It is measured as \\"induction time\\" and recorded as total hours before the oil breaks down. Canola oil requires 7.5 hours, for example, whereas extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and virgin coconut oil will last over a day at 110 ¬∞C of continuous heat. The differing stabilities correlate with lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are more prone to oxidation. EVOO is high in monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants, conferring stability. Some plant cultivars have been bred to produce \\"high- oleic\\" oils with more monounsaturated oleic acid and less polyunsaturated linoleic acid for enhanced stability. The oxidative stability does not directly correspond to the smoke point and thus the latter cannot be used as a reference for safe and healthy cooking.

He was the father of economist Henry Charles Carey. Early life and education Carey was born in Dublin into a middle-class Catholic family in 1760. He entered the bookselling and printing business in 1775, and when still only seventeen published a pamphlet criticizing dueling. This publication was quickly followed by another work criticizing the severity of the Irish penal code, and another criticizing Parliament. As a result, the British House of Commons threatened him with prosecution, and Carey fled to Paris in 1781.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mathew_Carey.aspx There he met Benjamin Franklin, the ambassador representing the American Revolutionary forces, who achieved independence that year. Franklin took Carey on to work in his printing office. Carey worked for Franklin for a year before returning to Ireland, where he edited two Irish nationalist newspapers, The Freeman's Journal and The Volunteer's Journal.Davidson, Cathy N., Ed. Reading in America: Literature and Social History. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1989, p. 159. To avoid imprisonment and prosecution by the British, Carey dressed as a woman and snuck on a ship to emigrate to the newly independent United States in September 1784.Davidson, Cathy N., p. 159. Career in America Upon Carey's arrival in Philadelphia, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette gave him $400 to establish himself, and he used this money to set up a new publishing business and a book shop, establishing: * The Pennsylvania Herald (1785) * Columbian Magazine (1786), and * The American Museum. None of these ventures proved very profitable, although the American Museum became the first American periodical to treat American culture as rich and original instead of a poor imitation of Great Britain's. Carey printed the first American version of the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible, popularly known as the Carey Bible, in 48 weekly installments, which subscribers could then have bound. It was the first Roman Catholic version of the Bible printed in the United States. Carey also printed numerous editions of the King James Version. In 1794‚Äì1796, Carey published America's first atlases. At Google Books. His 1802 map of Washington, D.C., was the first to name the stretch of land west of the United States Capitol as the \\"Mall\\".(1) At Google Books. (2) (3) Page 23 in He frequently wrote on various social topics, including events during the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793, which proved a crisis for the city. Carey reported on debates in the state legislature as well as provided political commentary in his essays. He was a Catholic as well as founding member of the American Sunday-School Society, along with Quaker merchant Thomas P. Cope, Dr. Benjamin Rush and Episcopal bishop William White. In 1822 Carey published Essays on Political Economy; or, The Most Certain Means of Promoting the Wealth, Power, Resources, and Happiness of Nations, Applied Particularly to the United States At Internet Archives: eBooks and Texts. one of the first treatises favoring Alexander Hamilton's protectionist economic policy. During Carey's lifetime, the publishing firm evolved to M. Carey & Son (1817‚Äì1821), M. Carey & Sons (1821‚Äì1824), and then to Carey & Lea (1824). Carey retired in 1825, leaving the publishing business to his son, Henry Charles Carey and son-in-law Isaac Lea. Lea and Henry Carey made the business successful and, for a time it was one of the most prominent publishers in the country. The business published such works as: The Encyclopedia Americana, A dictionary of German lexicon, as well as American editions of the works of Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper.http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/essays/1801-1900/carey-lea-printer-and- publisher/publishers-of-philadelphia.php Politics Upon arriving in America, Carey quickly developed political connections in the developing country. One of his most important supporters was John Adams, still a leading figure of the Federalist Party at the time. Carey's passionate support for the establishment of an American Navy contributed significantly to his alliance with the Federalists. Throughout his political career in America, Carey supported the development and maintenance of American naval strength, even after joining Jefferson‚Äôs Democratic-Republicans in 1796. Carey‚Äôs political realignment occurred shortly before the American ratification of the Jay Treaty, primarily intended to ensure peace with Britain, while distancing America from France. Carey‚Äôs strong support of American naval power and his \\"early political activities in Ireland had developed in part, by the American navy‚Äôs decision to carry the war [the American Revolution] into the home waters of Great Britain. John Paul Jones‚Äô victory over off Belfast in June 1778 unleashed a torrent of pro-American sentiment.\\" His publishing in America channeled his energy toward productive political objectives. His published works are credited with swaying public opinion toward the establishment of a powerful American navy. Carey‚Äôs book Naval History of the United States, was meant to influence the public. Its conspicuous omission of naval activity during the American Quasi-War with France showed his political intentions. It helped direct political energy against the British, with which the U.S. was at war at the time of the book‚Äôs publication on May 6, 1813. Focus on the British, known around the world for their naval power, made an influential case for extending the reach of the American navy. Along with his publication of Naval History, Carey wrote Olive Branch, published in 1814. He tried to eliminate competition between the two American political parties to create unity during the War of 1812. To many people, these efforts, and his early relationship with Franklin, made him the logical choice as Franklin's political successor. Scholars believe that he contributed significantly by his books and publications to the establishment of the United States Whig Party. Marriage and family Carey and his wife Bridget Flahaven Carey (1769‚Äì1839) had at least eight children, including sons Henry, Edward L. Carey (d. 1845), (Charles William Carey, 1802-) and daughters Maria, Susan, Elizabeth, Ellen and Frances Anne. Frances Anne Carey (1799‚Äì1873) married Isaac Lea, who joined the Careys' publishing firm and became a partner. In 1833, Isaac Lea took on a new partner, William A. Blanchard, and after the death of Mathew Carey and retirement of Henry Carey, they changed the business name to \\"Lea and Blanchard.\\" Later Lea took on his sons, and they changed the name to \\"Lea Brothers and Company.\\" Death and legacy Carey was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory A significant portion of his business papers, as well as a very large number of original copies of works printed and/or published by him reside in the collections of the AAS. Carey died on September 16, 1839, and was buried in St. Mary's Catholic Churchyard in Philadelphia.Independence Hall Association In 1943, Publishers Weekly created the Carey-Thomas Award for creative publishing, naming it in honor of Mathew Carey and Isaiah Thomas.

Most of the neurons that project out of the pars reticulata are inhibitory GABAergic neurons (i.e., these neurons release GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter). Anatomy Neurons in the pars reticulata are much less densely packed than those in the pars compacta (they were sometimes named pars diffusa). They are smaller and thinner than the dopaminergic neurons and conversely identical and morphologically similar to the pallidal neurons (see primate basal ganglia). Their dendrites as well as the pallidal are preferentially perpendicular to the striatal afferents. The massive striatal afferents correspond to the medial end of the nigrostriatal bundle. Nigral neurons have the same peculiar synaptology with the striatal axonal endings. They make connections with the dopamine neurons of the pars compacta whose long dendrites plunge deeply in the pars reticulata. The neurons of the pars reticulata produce the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The neurons of the pars reticulata through the nigrothalamic bundle send axons to a particular part of the motor thalamus. The nigral territory corresponds to the nucleus ventralis anterior (VA) (see also List of thalamic nuclei) (different from the pallidal VO). VA is the origin of one output of the basal ganglia system. It sends axons to the frontal and oculomotor cortex. In addition the pars reticulata sends neurons to the pars parafascicularis of the central region of the thalamus and to the pedunculopontine complex). The particularity of the pars lateralis is to send its axons to the superior colliculus, which is a too minimized output of the basal ganglia system. Function The neurons of the pars reticulata are fast-spiking pacemakers, generating action potentials in the absence of synaptic input. In primates they discharge at a mean rate of 68 Hz in contrast to dopaminergic neurons (below 8 Hz). They receive abundant afferrences from the striatum (mainly from the associative striatum) with the same very peculiar synaptology as the pallidum. It receives axons from the subthalamic nucleus and a dopaminergic innervation from the dopaminergic ensemble. The pars reticulata is one of the two primary output nuclei of the basal ganglia system to the motor thalamus (the other output is the internal segment of the globus pallidus). The nigral neurons have their own territory distinct from the cerebellar and the pallidal in the nucleus ventralis anterior VA. This sends axons to the frontal and oculomotor cortex. Hikosaka and Wurtz devoted four papers to \\"the visual and oculomotor functions of the monkey substantia nigra pars reticulata\\". This is largely involved in orientation and the control of eye movements in stabilisation of gaze and in saccades. Pars reticulata sends inhibitory projections to the superior colliculus, inhibiting eye movement, and this inhibition is 'lifted', i.e. the projecting neurons cease firing, during saccades. Pathology The function of the neurons of the pars compacta (not reticulata) is profoundly changed (60% of Dopamine secreting neurons, 80% decrease in dopamine in striatum) in parkinsonism and epilepsy. These changes are thought to be mostly secondary to pathology elsewhere in the brain, but may be crucial to understanding the generation of the symptoms of these disorders.

Biography Kuryokhin began his acting career as a piano and keyboard player with a school band in Leningrad. After playing with professional jazz bands, as well as popular rock musicians, Kuryokhin went through several stages in his career and eventually became one of the most recognisable names and faces in Russia during the 1980s and 1990s. By the end of his life, he had emerged as an avant-garde film composer, performance artist and film actor. Outside Russia he is primarily known as a jazz and experimental musician, through his works released since 1981 on UK's Leo Records, as well as his concert tours with Ensemble Pop-Mekhanika and his happening show also titled Pop Mekhanika. He also made a significant contribution to several albums (in particular: Triangle, Taboo and Radio Africa) of the famous Russian rock band Aquarium. His memorable film works include starring in (and composing music for) Two Captains II ('), a comedic pseudo-documentary about World War I; the soundtrack to the neo-noir Russian horror film The Designer ('), and the lead role of the combative nerd taking on the local mob in Lokh pobeditel vody. Kuryokhin shot to fame after creating one of the first popular media viruses in the Russian media. It was one of his semi-improvised acts of performance art, broadcast live on Russian television in May 1991. As a guest on the popular talk show Fifth Wheel, Kuryokhin provided \\"proof\\" that Lenin was a mushroom. During the 1990s, Kuryokhin was a board member of the St. Petersburg City Council for Culture and Tourism. In 1995 Kuryokhin joined the National Bolshevik Party. =Death= He died of a rare heart condition, cardiac sarcoma, aged 42 in 1996, and was laid to rest in the Komarovo Cemetery, near the tomb of Anna Akhmatova. Legacy The Saint-Petersburg Annual International Music Festival SKIF (Sergey Kuriokhin International Festival) is named after him. Kuryokhin festivals annually take place in Berlin, Amsterdam and New York. In 2004 the Sergey Kuryokhin Foundation and the Kuryokhin Center were founded. The foundation collects information about Kuryokhin and the Center organises events in the spirit of the artist. Both are located in the same building, an old cinema in Saint Petersburg. In 2009 the Sergey Kuryokhin Foundation and the Kuryokhin Center established an annual award in the field of the modern art.

HMTD is an organic peroxide, a heterocyclic compound with a cage- like structure. It is a primary explosive. It has been considered as an initiating explosive for blasting caps in the early part of 20th century, mostly because of its high initiating power (higher than that of mercury fulminate) and its inexpensive production. As such, it was quickly taken up as a primary explosive in mining applications.Taylor, C. A.; Rinkenbach, W. H. Army Ordnance 1924. 5, 463‚Äì466 However, it has since been superseded by more (chemically) stable compounds such as dextrinated lead azide and DDNP (which contains no lead or mercury). HMTD is widely used in amateur made blasting caps. Preparation and structure First synthesised in 1885 by Legler, HMTD may be prepared by the reaction of an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and hexamine in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as citric acid, acetic acid or dilute sulfuric acid. The hydrogen peroxide needs to be at least 12% w/w concentration, as lower concetrations lead to poor yields. Citric acid is overall superior to other acids, providing a yield of up to about 50%. The molecule adopts a cage-like structure with the nitrogen atoms having a trigonal planar geometry. Properties as an explosive Like other organic peroxides, such as acetone peroxide (TATP), HMTD is unstable and detonates upon shock, friction, static electricity discharges, concentrated sulfuric acid, strong UV radiation and heat. Cases of detonation caused by the simple act of screwing a lid on a jar containing HMTD have been reported.St√∫paj√∫ci trend podom√°ckej v√Ωroby v√Ωbu≈°nin a udalosti s t√Ωm spojen√©, Kriminalistick√Ω a expert√≠zny √∫stav Policajn√©ho zboru, p. 8 http://www.unms.sk/swift_data/source/dokumenty/skusobnictvo/upravy_2009/odborne_seminare_2008/KEU_BA_01_10_2008.pdf, written in Slovak Common static electricity discharges have been reported to cause detonation.Explosive Properties of Primary Explosives - Springer, p.21, section 2.33, , https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642284359-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1379807-p174306459 It is, however, less unstable than many other peroxides under normal conditions; exposure to ultraviolet light increases its sensitivity. It also reacts with most common metals, which can lead to detonation. HMTD is chemically very stable when pure (free of acids, bases, and metal ions) and does not quickly sublime like its acetone counterparts. HMTD is a more powerful initiating explosive than mercury fulminate, but its poor thermal and chemical stability prevents its use in detonators. Nevertheless, HMTD is one of the three most widely used primary explosives in improvised, amateur made blasting caps. The other being TATP and silver acetylide. HMTD is a common source of injury among amateur chemists, particularly finger amputations. Most of these injuries are caused by small amounts of HMTD that inadvertently detonate in close proximity of fingers, since small amounts (grams) are generally not powerful enough to amputate fingers from distances larger than 5 ‚Äì 10 cm.St√∫paj√∫ci trend podom√°ckej v√Ωroby v√Ωbu≈°nin a udalosti s t√Ωm spojen√©, Kriminalistick√Ω a expert√≠zny √∫stav Policajn√©ho zboru, p. 8 http://www.unms.sk/swift_data/source/dokumenty/skusobnictvo/upravy_2009/odborne_seminare_2008/KEU_BA_01_10_2008.pdf, written in Slovak Experienced amateurs handle HMTD in such a manner as to avoid any close contact between fingers and the explosive itself, from synthesis to final detonation. Such measures, for example, include using multiple filter papers during the filtration step that are exchanged as not to have more than 0.2 g of HMTD on a single filter paper, pre-bent papers with cotton wrapped wooden rods for manipulation and blast mitigation devices for final filling. Calculated (Explo5) detonation pressure Pcj at crystal density 1.597 g/cm3 is 218 kbar with velocity of detonation VoD = 7777 m/s. Explosion temperature is 3141 K, energy of explosion is 5612 kJ/kg (or 3400 - 4000 kJ/kg per various sources) and volume of explosion gases at STP is calculated to be 826 l/kg. Loose powder has density close to 0.4 g/cm3, hence the common detonation velocities are closer to 3000 m/s and Pcj is closer to 15 kbar. Sensitivity HMTD is overall slightly more sensitive than fresh TATP and can be considered to be slightly more dangerous than an average primary explosive. The variance of friction force between different surfaces (e.g. different kinds of paper) is often greater than the variance between the friction sensitivity of a given pair of primary explosives. This leads to different values for friction sensitivity measured at different laboratories. Terrorism Despite no longer being used in any military application, and despite its shock sensitivity, HMTD remains a common home-made explosive and has been used in a large number of suicide bombings and other attacks throughout the world. For example, it was one of the components in the explosives intended to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in the 2000 millennium attack plots and the 2016 New York and New Jersey bombings, as well as one of the components of the explosives attempted to be made by the neo- Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division in the United States.

The original mid-18th century estate was the country residence of Col. Godfrey Malbone of Virginia and Connecticut. The main house burned down during a dinner party in 1766 and the remaining structure sat dormant for many years until New York lawyer Jonathan Prescott Hall built a new roughly castellated residence directly on top of the old ivy-covered ruins. History Located on Malbone Road, the estate has a history dating to the mid-18th century, but the present main house was built in 1848-49. The estate once served as the country residence of Colonel Godfrey Malbone (1695‚Äì1768) of Virginia and Connecticut. Colonel Malbone made his fortune as a shipping merchant and slave trader, becoming one of the wealthiest men in Newport during the 1740s through privateering and the triangle trade. Malbone's 1741 mansion was designed by Richard Munday, a noted colonial architect who also designed Newport landmarks Trinity Church and the Old Colony House. The mansion was so grand that it was widely considered the finest house in all of the American colonies. Future President George Washington boarded and dined at Malbone in February 1756 when he visited Col. Malbone, who was Washington's friend dating back to Malbone's childhood in Virginia. In 1766, during the course of a gala dinner party, a kitchen fire reduced the house to a pile of sandstone rubble. By several accounts, Colonel Malbone, seeing no reason why the party should be interrupted, ordered dinner to be served outside, proclaiming, \\"By God, if I must lose my house, I shall not lose my dinner!\\" From 1766, the year of the fire, until the 1840s, the ruins of Malbone's estate was a popular attraction among Newporters. =1840s mansion= Malbone Castle as printed in The Architectural Heritage of Newport Rhode Island 1640 - 1915 (and credited originally from the Knickerbocker Magazine, 1859).Malbone in 2013 In 1848 a new mansion was built directly on top of the old ivy-covered ruins by Mr. & Mrs. Jonathan Prescott Hall. Hall was an eminent New York lawyer and direct descendant of two signers of the Declaration of Independence.Lockwood, Alice G. B. Gardens of Colony and State: Gardens and Gardeners of the American Colonies and of the Republic Before 1840 Published by Charles Scribner's Sons for the Garden Club of America New York 1934. The Halls commissioned Alexander Jackson Davis, a notable 19th-century New York architect, to design a house of pink Connecticut sandstone in the popular Gothic revival style of the time, incorporating some original elements such as the porte-cochere from the previous home. Hall, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, died in September 1862. In 1875, the house's interiors were remodeled under the supervision of noted local architect Dudley Newton who added a \\"massive carved oak staircase.\\"Malbone NRHP Nomination. 1976. The mansion remained in the same family for over 130 years, serving as the summer \\"cottage\\" of the Morris- Bedlow family (including Lewis Gouverneur Morris), a prominent family from New York who held positions of social and political prominence in America and Newport in the 18th and 19th centuries. Malbone Estate had some of the most prominent formal gardens in America during the 18th and 19th centuries. The gardens were originally established by Col. Malbone to the south of the house because it was from this direction that visitors and merchants from Newport town would approach the estate. Prescott Hall renovated these gardens from 1848-1850, expanding them to 17 acres and enlisting Andrew Jackson Downing, the leading landscape designer of the mid-18th century and an advocate of architectural philosophy. Downing partnered with Calvert Vaux to design the White House grounds and National Mall, collaborated with Frederick Law Olmsted to design Central Park, and is widely regarded as the \\"Father of American Landscape Architecture.\\" The Malbone Gardens have been recently restored with an emphasis on the brick pathways lined by boxwoods, the central stone waterway, four prominent weeping willows, and the carriage path lined by beech trees, all remnants of Downing's original 1848 design. =Current ownership= The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The grounds of the estate \\"contain the largest collection of European beech trees in North America.\\" The Morris family bequeathed Malbone to the Preservation Society of Newport County in 1978, who sold the estate to Patricia and Philip Archer Thomas in 1980. Around 1994, the Malbone estate was acquired by James Leach, who hosted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg there in 2004. In 2013, Leach listed the estate for sale for $2.2 million dollars, and it was purchased by the Brede Family of Wellesley, Massachusetts. The mansion remains a private residence to this day, the only Newport Mansion not open to tours or the public.

Description They are dense, thorny plants growing to 3‚Äì6 m tall, with sharp, 3‚Äì6 cm long stem spines in the leaf axils. Buds at the base of the spine produce clusters of alternately arranged simple ovate leaves 3‚Äì10 cm long. The flowers are inconspicuous, solitary or clustered, with no petals. They are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is an edible, yellow to purple globose berry 2‚Äì4 cm diameter, containing several small seeds. They are very juicy and with an acidic flavour. Cultivation and uses Several species are grown for their fruit; D. caffra (Umkokola or Kei-apple) is popular in southern Africa, and D. hebecarpa (Kitembilla) in India and Sri Lanka. Some, notably D. abyssinica, are also grown as ornamental plants and as hedges, where the spines are valued for deterring intrusion by livestock or burglars. The tropical apricot, or ketcot, is a hybrid between D. hebecarpa and D. abyssinica that was developed in Florida in 1953 and is cultivated for its fruit.

Aloisio the New, known in Russian as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin, was an Italian Renaissance architect invited by Ivan III to work in Moscow.Dariusz Kolodziejczyk, The Crimean Khanate and Poland-Lithuania: International Diplomacy on the European Periphery, (Brill, 2011), xxviii. Some Italian scholars have attempted to identify him with the Venetian sculptor Alevisio Lamberti da Montagnano, but the point is still widely disputed. On his way to Russia, Aloisio was captured by Me√±li I Giray, the khan of Crimea. At the khan's court, Aloisio built some sections of the famous palace in Bakhchisaray. The Italianate carved portal of the palace is particularly noteworthy. In 1504 he finally arrived in Moscow, with a letter of recommendation from the khan. He became known to Russians as Aleviz the New, to distinguish him from his namesake, who had been working at the Kremlin since 1494. Aloisio's first and principal work in Moscow was the Archangel Cathedral, the burial place of Muscovite monarchs.William Craft Brumfield, Landmarks of Russian Architect, (Routledge, 2013), 76. The cathedral's elaborate Renaissance ornamentation was extensively copied throughout 16th- century Russia. Aloisio the New was last mentioned in 1514, when he was entrusted by Vasily III to build 11 churches in Moscow. Although only parts of these structures have been preserved, there is enough evidence to assume that they were built in strikingly differing styles. The best preserved of these churches is the cathedral of the Vysokopetrovsky Monastery in Moscow (1514‚Äì17), considered the earliest rotunda in Russia.

It was also released for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in early 2000. This game is part of Midway's Thunder series of racing games, which includes Offroad Thunder, 4 Wheel Thunder, and Arctic Thunder. Hydro Thunder Hurricane, a sequel to Hydro Thunder, was later released for the Xbox 360 on July 27, 2010 on Xbox Live Arcade. Gameplay Arcade version showcasing the boat Banshee racing on the Ship Graveyard track The gameplay of Hydro Thunder consists of racing high- tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle, to a post-apocalyptic, flooded version of New York City. Scattered across the tracks are blue and red boost icons. When touched these icons allow the player who touched them to boost. Red boost icons are more scarce than blue boost icons due to the fact red boost icons give more boost fuel. When a player has boost fuel they may use the boost button to boost, which allows a player's boat to reach speeds much higher than what would normally be possible. Also by boosting a player can knock other boats into the air, a feature described by the game as the Mighty Hull. Another aspect of boosting is the Hydro Jump which is performed by braking and using the boost button. When combined with the many ramps on the tracks, players can reach short cuts and boost icons that would normally not be accessible otherwise. The boats in Hydro Thunder are divided into four categories: easy, medium, hard, and bonus. The easy boats tend to be easy to control but they do not have the speed of other classes. Medium boats are in the middle, and Hard boats are usually very difficult to control but are very fast. Bonus boats are accessible by entering a combination to access the boat. The tracks in Hydro Thunder like the boats are divided into four classes: easy, medium, hard and bonus. The easy tracks are usually short and easy with the bonus tracks being the longest and hardest. The arcade version of the game had only two bonus tracks, New York Disaster and Nile Adventure. Hydro Speedway was present as a hidden track. The console versions add two more, Catacomb and Castle Von Dandy, making four in all. Development and release The arcade version of Hydro Thunder utilizes the same basic cabinet as Midway's earlier Hyperdrive. It has the same cabinet seat as Atari's San Francisco Rush. It also has the same steering wheel on the control panel as Cruis'n USA, minus the standard foot pedals, and adds a variable position throttle with forward, neutral and reverse directions. The game also has an unusual volume adjustment, where the regular play volume is usually set lower than the feedback volume for the subwoofer in the seat. This is intended to place the player \\"in the game\\" and make the player feel like an actual pilot of a powerful, high-tech speedboat. In addition to the arcade, Hydro Thunder has been ported over to several home consoles. The PlayStation version of the game includes a career mode not found in the other versions. The Dreamcast version of the game has graphics that are more detailed and closer to the arcade version than the other console versions. The Nintendo 64 version allows up to 4-player local multiplayer (instead of just 2-player) when the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is present. A standalone Windows version was released exclusively through budget re-releases in Europe. The Dreamcast port became one of the few Sega All Stars titles. Midway Games had plans to create a double pack for Hydro Thunder and San Francisco Rush 2049 under the name Hydro Rush for the PlayStation 2. However, the game was cancelled and the project moved to Midway Arcade Treasures 3IGN: Hydro Rush (a compilation of Midway's many racing games) for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, and was also included in the later Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for Windows - however neither of these versions were based on the arcade original, but rather the Dreamcast port. =Sequel= Midway had plans to create a sequel for Hydro Thunder; however, the project was soon cancelled and never recreated - though it did result in the formation of the Thunder sub-series including Offroad Thunder and Arctic Thunder. In January 2009, Raw Thrills announced a spiritual successor titled H2Overdrive, developed with the assistance of the former Midway San Diego members who worked on the original arcade version of Hydro Thunder.New boat racing game by Raw Thrills‚Äô and the Hydro Thunder team to be at ATEI On March 26, 2010, a sequel titled Hydro Thunder Hurricane was announced for Xbox Live Arcade. Microsoft had bought the rights to the series after Midway was acquired by Warner Bros. It was released on July 28, 2010. Reception Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you've been longing for the next exciting racing game after Rush: The Rock, it's here.\\" IGN scored the Dreamcast version of Hydro Thunder at 8.7 out of 10.

The tablets burn smokelessly, have a high energy density, do not liquefy while burning and leave no ashes. Invented in Murrhardt, Germany, in 1936, the main component is hexamine, which was discovered by Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859. Some fuel tablets use 1,3,5-trioxane as another ingredient. Esbit is a genericized trademark that people often use to refer to similar products made by other companies. In most countries from the former Soviet bloc, fuel tablets are called dry alcohol.  Uses  Folding hexamine stove with packaged fuel The tablets are used for cooking by campers, the military and relief organizations. They are often used with disposable metal stoves that are included with field ration packs. An Esbit beverage-can stove can be made by cutting off the bottom of an aluminium soft drink can, and turning it upside down to support the fuel tablet. A pot can be supported above this with a circle of chicken wire or metal tent pegs. The burning tablets are sensitive to wind, so a simple windscreen should be used, such as a strip of aluminium foil curved in a circle around the pot and stove. If necessary, the fuel tablet can be placed on a rock or on the dirt, with a pot supported above it by rocks, but this is less than ideal. Another common use is to provide a relatively safe (see disadvantages below) heat source for model steam engines, such as those manufactured by Wilesco and Mamod, and other external combustion engines such as Stirling engines and pop pop boats.  Advantages and disadvantages  Hexamine is prepared by the reaction of formaldehyde and ammonia. In an acidic environment hexamine is converted to toxic formaldehyde, which the main hazard for toxicity is by ingestion. Fuel tablets are simple, ultra-lightweight, and more compact than other fuel systems; the entire stove system and fuel can be stored inside a 0.5 litre (one pint) cooking pot. As with trioxane, hexamine has an almost infinite shelf life if stored properly, in a sealed dry container. However, the heat given off cannot be easily adjusted, so water can be boiled, but cooking requiring simmering is more difficult. Tablets are a powerful stove fuel (30.0 MJ/kg), and are sensitive to wind and dampness. Fuel tablets are expensive and are not as widely available compared to alternatives such as alcohol or petrol, but can use very cheap stoves. Esbit's Material Safety Data Sheet states combustion can create formaldehyde, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide and ingestion may cause nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, and kidney damage. When burned, the chemical oxidation of the fuel yields noxious fumes, which requires cooking foods in a container, such as a pot or pan, with a tight fitting lid. Burned tablets leave a sticky dark residue on the bottom of pots. If tablets are stored or used under damp conditions they can break up while burning and shed burning fragments, though this claim is hard to verify or reproduce.Warning leaflet packed with Mamod brand fuel tablets Hexamine is a precursor for the simplest synthesis of the chemical explosive RDX; in many areas its availability is tightly regulated due to this.

They were attested by the Roman historian Tacitus (Germania 43:3); this brief reference is the only mention of them as such in history. Ancient sources consider the border between Greater Germany and Scythia to be the River Vistula. It, however, bends to the east to place all of central and southern Poland on the ancient Germania bank. That Germanic expansion reached western Poland at least is unquestioned. Silesia was German in later historical times. It probably was the home of the Lugii, who are supposed in the sources to be in the eastern half of Suebia, which name descends to modern Schwaben. The Suebi were divided by the Black Forest. Today's Black Forest, which is a scarcely forested remnant, does not fit the description, but in ancient times it must have extended across most of southern Schwaben. The Lugii, then, as eastern Suebi, were most likely in Poland and Czechoslovakia. Considering the location, it is possible that Tacitus' name of Helisii is a Germanic form of the ancient municipality of Kalisz in central Poland, often identified with Ptolemy's Calisia, which was in Greater Germany. Helisii would in that case be from *Kalisii. Its location in Ptolemy may not be its modern location, as settlement names over time tend to duplicate or migrate along with their populations.

Paulton is a former coal mining village and the terminus of the Somerset Coal Canal is at Paulton basin, just north of the village. Paulton was home to the now-closed Polestar Purnells printing factory and Ashman's boot factory, where 'Voidax' safety footwear was manufactured, and in particular Motorcycle speedway boots. The area has been designated as an 'area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance' under section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Paulton has a small hospital, doctors surgery, dentist, chemist, nursing home, library, public swimming pool, newsagent, travel agent, two convenience stores, a filling station, three takeaways, fire station, two pre-schools (Noahs Ark Preschool and Acorn Pre-school), an infant school and junior school. The village is also served by a nearby supermarket. There are two pubs in the village: The Red Lion and The Lamb. A licensed bar and restaurant: La Campagna was previously a public house known as The Winterfield Inn (which closed in 2015). Until the mid-1980s, there was also The Queen Victoria, but this was demolished to make way for flats, and The Somerset Inn which closed in 2011, with the adjoining paddock the subject of an unsuccessful planning application since, which would have seen it turned into a 22 home housing estate. There are also two members' clubs in the village, Paulton Rovers F.C. and Greyfield's Sports and Social club. The centre of the village is the location for the war memorial and a small library. There is another war memorial just outside the village, to the southwest, which commemorates the location where 23 men were killed on 17 September 1944 when the glider they were flying in crashed en route from R.A.F. Keevil to Arnhem, as part of Operation Market Garden. History The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton. During the reign of Edward III the lord of the manor was Sir John de Palton and his descendants. Hill House was built in around 1760 by John Hill (1729‚Äì1789) and was owned by his descendants until 1883 when it was leased to various tenants until 1902 when it was bought by Walter Draper. Draper sold it to Purnell's a local printing company, who owned it until 1971 when it was bought by the local doctor and refurbished. It is a Grade II listed building. John Hill was an innkeeper, and his son Thomas Ames Hill (1759‚Äì1827) owned the Red Lion pub. By 1834 his nephew John Hill jnr. had taken over the pub, and was living there with his family. =Coal mining= 'The Batch' Much evidence of coal mining on the Somerset Coalfield still exists in and around the village, including a spoil tip known as \\"The Batch\\" in the shape of a volcano. Paulton basin is the terminus of the northern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal and was a central point for at least 15 collieries around Paulton, Timsbury and High Littleton, which were connected to the canal by tramroads. It was served by two small railways stations: Paulton Radford and Timsbury Halt and Paulton Halt on the Camerton Branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. Although the canal has been derelict since the end of the 19th century, a restoration project began in 2013 and there are plans to re-open the entire length from Paulton to Limpley Stoke, where the first quarter-mile of the canal was restored in the 1980s and is now a busy marina. The deepest mine of its time (1800 feet) was at Timsbury; the largest drydock on the canal system in the country is on the east side of Paulton basin, and the canal carried record tonnages of coal during the 1820s and 1830s. This canal carried the coal that fueled the Georgian development of Bath during most of the nineteenth century. On the northern side of Paulton basin was the terminus for the tramroad which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line were still in use in 1873, probably carrying horse-drawn wagons of coal. The southern side of the basin served Brittens, Littleborrok, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill and Simons Hill, terminating at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871, as were the collieries it served. =Modern industry= Paulton was the location of the first Great Mills DIY store, and the company's head office was located adjacent to the store. It used to be called Old Mills DIY, by virtue of the fact that the store was sited on the former Old Mills colliery baths site. The Great Mills business was acquired by Focus DIY Ltd in 2000, and all of the stores were rebranded. This site has since been taken over by Wickes. Tesco is a major employer in the village. Although this large store is described as being in Midsomer Norton it lies within Paulton's parish boundaries. =Housing= In 2009‚Äì2015 the Purnells factory was replaced with 420 houses, a family restaurant, green places, small industrial units and a park. Governance Paulton has its own parish council, formed in 1894. This body maintains the following amenities in the parish: the cemetery, Memorial Park, Miners Welfare Recreation Ground, Wallenge Open Space, Noah's Ark Pre-school, nine allotments and the war memorial. The council is also responsible for the public convenience in the Red Lion car park which is leased from B&NES.; The leases for the village hall and the swimming pool are held by the parish council. These amenities are looked after by independent management committees with the parish council funding major capital works to the buildings. Paulton is represented on the Bath and North East Somerset Council by two Labour Councillors, Liz Hardman and Grant Johnson. The unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1972. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The five churches include the Methodist Church, dated 1894, Baptist Church (1724) and Church of the Holy Trinity, dated 1757 and 1839, the latter by John Pinch the younger, which includes a cholera monument, from the early to mid 19th century and several other monuments in the churchyard. The Anglican Church of the Trinity is located in the parish of Paulton and Diocese of Bath and Wells. It is a Grade II* listed building. Paulton is currently serving as part of the 10 lamps ministry group and is part of the benefice with St John's, Farrington Gurney and Holy Trinity, High Littleton. Sports Paulton Rovers F.C. play in the Southern Football League Premier Division League having been promoted by winning the Division One South & West play off final 2-0 at previously unbeaten Merthyr Town with Nick McCootie scoring both goals. Purnell Cricket Club provides the village with a well-established cricket club. They run youth teams for school aged children of all abilities and currently enter 2 senior teams in league cricket on Saturdays throughout the summer. Further sports facilities are present on the same complex as the cricket club, with tennis courts, bowls, a gym and a football pitch home to Purnells Sports F.C. Paulton also has a public swimming pool/club.

He joined Radio Ceylon in the 1960s. His mellow voice attracted hundreds of fans in Sri Lanka as well as on the Indian sub- continent. Bhareti joined the station when it was popular across South Asia. Radio Ceylon ruled the airwaves and millions tuned into the station from the vast Indian sub-continent. Bhareti's mellow voice proved popular with local listeners in Sri Lanka as well as listeners on the All Asia beam of the station. He became part of the institution at a time when Radio Ceylon was riding the crest of the radio waves. He was appointed by Livy Wijemanne who was by then Director of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. Bhareti was mentored by senior broadcasters at the station, such as Vernon Corea who gave him his early training in the art of radio. In the early years, Nihal Bhareti assisted Vernon Corea in popular radio programmes such as Take It Or Leave It, broadcast in front of a 'live' audience, from a studio in Radio Ceylon. He was a quick learner and his adaptability coupled with a smooth, voice proved to be a hit with listeners of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Bhareti was a true professional. Nihal Bhareti presented Radio Journal for a decade, this was a popular magazine programme with news, interviews, music and snippets. He was the voice behind such programmes as Holiday Choice, Housewive's Choice, and Choice of the People, on the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.' He has been in the forefront of key entertainment programmes in South Asia.Nihal Bhareti has presented the equivalent of the British radio programme 'Desert Island Discs' over the airwaves of the SLBC.Well known personalities, even Sri Lankan politicians have all been on the programme. He has interviewed many Sri Lankan music stars for the SLBC, including Nimal Mendis and Mignonne Fernando of the Jetliners. He climbed the management ladder and he was appointed Director English Services of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in the 1980s. Bhareti can still be heard on the airwaves and remains a firm favourite with listeners on the island of Sri Lanka. Quite apart from his work on radio, Bhareti has compered many entertainment shows in Colombo. He has also presented entertainment programmes on Sri Lankan television.
